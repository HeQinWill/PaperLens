Rath;Valentin Rougé;Julie Tolu;Daniel Rentsch;Maria Lia Halder;Urs von Gunten,"Reactions of N,O- and N,S-Azoles and -Azolines with Ozone: Kinetics and Mechanisms","N,O- and N,S-azoles and -azolines are common functional groups in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and natural products. Their fate during ozone-based water treatment processes is unknown due to a lack of kinetic and mechanistic information on their reactions with ozone. Apparent second-order rate constants kO3 of 12 model compounds were determined at pH 7: oxazoles react 2 orders of magnitude faster (kO3 = 9 × 102–5 × 104 M–1s–1, depending on their substituents) than thiazoles (kO3 = 1 × 101–2 × 103 M–1s–1). The low kO3 of thiazoles limits their degradability during ozonation. Only small yields of reactive oxygen species (•OH, H2O2, and 1O2) were observed during ozonation of oxazoles, suggesting that all oxygen atoms from ozone are incorporated into the products. Oxazoles and thiazoles react initially by a Criegee-type reaction at the C=C double bond, followed by two reaction branches, leading to two observed product groups: (1) carboxylates and cyanate; (2) formate, amide and CO2. For thiazoles, thiocarboxylic acids were identified as intermediates, reacting further to sulfate and carboxylic acids, forming 1O2. The nonaromatic 2-methyloxazoline is unreactive toward ozone. 2-Methylthiazoline reacts fast (kO3 = 2 × 104 M–1s–1), forming 1O2, leading to ring-opening and formation of dimerization products which react further to N-acetyltaurine. These results enhance the understanding of the ozone reactivity of heterocycles and help predict transformation product formation."

However, many recalcitrant DBPs like 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) still persist in the effluent, threatening water ecosystem safety. Here, we constructed a highly active and stable faceted photocatalyst, consisting of Al-doped SrTiO3 loaded with spatially separated cobalt oxide (CoOx) and palladium (Pd) cocatalysts, for efficiently eliminating the halogenated DBPs including 4-CP. This photocatalyst with a dual cocatalyst design enabled efficient photocharge separation and synergized the reductive dechlorination and oxidative degradation processes to augment 4-CP removal, exhibiting 70-fold higher decontamination efficiency than the cocatalyst-free control and 7-fold higher activity than the unfaceted control. Importantly, the high UV activity and singlet oxygen (1O2)-dominated oxidation pathway of the photocatalyst rendered it superior in environmental robustness and adaptability to the existing UV/chlorine process. Consequently, by introducing this photocatalyst, a rapid in situ elimination of DBPs during UV/chlorine treatment of the secondary effluent of a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was achieved, with the concentrations of several representative DBPs all below the detection limits (<10–9 g/mL). In addition, it also demonstrated superior stability during cyclic photocatalytic decontamination and during long-term continuous operation in a photocatalytic membrane reactor for UV/chlorine treatment. Our work presents an important advancement to photocatalytic advanced oxidation processes and may inspire further development of photocatalytic water purification and disinfection technologies."

However, climate change and human disturbances are altering wetland hydrology with water level fluctuations profoundly influencing carbon sequestration. While previous syntheses and modeling studies have suggested the existence of water level thresholds in wetland carbon dynamics, the mechanisms underlying these thresholds remain poorly understood, and field-based evidence is lacking. Here, we present results from a long-term field experiment across six water level treatments, ranging from 100 to 40 cm above the soil surface. We identify a carbon sink threshold occurring between −20 and 0 cm, as water levels rise to the soil surface. This threshold emerges from water-level-induced soil-vegetation feedbacks. We further show that the dominant control of CO2 exchange shifts from soil properties (moisture and salinity) to vegetation traits (height and coverage) once the threshold is crossed. These findings provide in situ empirical evidence for a wetland carbon threshold and highlight the critical role of ecohydrological feedbacks. Our study offers new insights into wetland carbon dynamics under changing hydrological regimes and informs management strategies for enhancing wetland carbon storage."

To address this gap, we developed general steroidogenesis modulation models using data from ∼1,800 chemicals screened in H295R human adrenocortical carcinoma cells. A random forest model was validated using a prospective test set of 20 compounds (14 predicted active, 6 inactive), achieving 80% accuracy with conformal prediction adjustments. In parallel, we built classification and regression models based on IC50 data from ChEMBL for key steroidogenic enzymes, including CYP17A1, CYP21A2, CYP11B1, CYP11B2, 17β-HSD (1/2/3/5), 5α-reductase (1/2), and CYP19A1 (126–9,327 compounds per target). These models enable predictions of both general steroidogenesis inhibition and potential molecular targets. Additionally, we developed a transformer-based model (MolBART) to predict all end points simultaneously and validated this performance. Combined, these models may offer a rapid and scalable system for assessing chemical impacts on steroidogenesis, supporting chemical risk assessment, product stewardship, and regulatory decision-making."

In this study, we aimed to identify previously unrecognized endocrine disruptors in thermal paper by employing a nontargeted screening coupled ToxPi Ranking (NSTR) approach. Among the substances identified with high confidence in thermal paper, Crystal Violet Lactone (CVL), a typical thermochromic dye, was prioritized with a high endocrine disruptive potential. CVL can be absorbed through the skin and excreted in the urine. In addition, we demonstrated significant bioaccumulation of CVL in zebrafish tissues, with hepatic concentrations reaching up to 3.1 times those in the exposure water, and five biotransformation products were identified. CVL exposure impaired the reproductive capacity of breeding pairs, led to gonadal histological alterations, and exhibited developmental toxicity to F1 offspring. Transcriptional analysis revealed disruptions in the expression of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad-liver (HPG-L) axis genes in adults. In embryos, CVL significantly increased the frequency of epiboly, yolk extension formation, and somite number while decreasing the ear-eye distance and size of the yolk sac. Significant alterations in HPG-L axis genes were observed, as well. Thus, our data demonstrated that CVL targeted multiple end points in both adult fish and embryos, exhibiting remarkably endocrine disruptive effects."

To date, a limited number of compounds have been identified in disinfected wastewater. In this study, we proposed a framework for comprehensively screening and identifying thiol-reactive compounds using a thiol probe combined with a nontarget high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) analysis workflow, in which we monitored a fragment ion (C5H8NO3S–). To specifically target α,β-unsaturated carbonyls, this approach was developed and validated for 15 model α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Then, the technique was applied to analyze chlorinated municipal wastewater effluent, and 58 tentative thiol-reactive compounds were detected. We predicted the formulas of the 30 highest abundance α,β-unsaturated carbonyls. Among these, we used commercially available standards to validate our approach and quantify seven α,β-unsaturated carbonyls, namely, acrylic acid, 2,6-ditert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, trans-2-hexenal, 3-methyl-2-cyclopenten-1-one, dibutyl maleate and parthenolide, with concentrations ranging from <0.017–4.28 μg/L.

However, its increasing use may lead to its inadvertent environmental release, creating potential ecological and health risks that remain poorly understood. In this study, wild-type and transgenic zebrafish were used to evaluate the potential developmental toxicity of small-size BP (S-BP), with a lateral particle size of 154.4 ± 34.6 nm, focusing specifically on vascular growth and hematopoiesis at relatively low concentrations of 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/L. The results indicated that S-BP adhered to the chorion and induced developmental defects. The uninflated swim bladders and decreased heart rate were observed in S-BP-exposed larvae at 120 hpf. The angioarchitectural profiling using transgenic zebrafish showed that exposure to S-BP adversely impaired blood vessel development at 72 hpf, especially in the common cardinal vein (CCV). Moreover, erythropoiesis and the flow velocity of red blood cells (RBCs) were disturbed at 120 hpf in all of the S-BP-exposed groups. Transcriptomic analysis unveiled that S-BP exposure altered gene expression related to angiogenesis, hematopoiesis, ribosome function, and transport processes. Notably, the mRNA levels of vascular and hematopoietic markers, including clec14a, nme2b.1, klf2a, slc2a1a, csf1rb, atf3, scl, and scml4, were significantly downregulated following S-BP exposure. Our findings revealed that low concentrations of S-BP exposure caused vascular and hematologic toxicity and identified CCV and RBCs as sensitive targets.

Children exhibit heightened sensitivity to Pb exposure compared to adults, and prenatal Pb exposure can harm the developing fetal nervous system. However, the specific regulatory effects of Pb across various developmental stages are not well understood. This study employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to analyze mice brains at different ages (2 and 8 weeks) following prenatal and postnatal Pb exposure. Blood lead level in exposed mice is comparable to those detected in human samples, implying its environmental implication. A total of 43,303 brain cells were sequenced for cell-specific analysis. Pb exposure was found to elevate the proportion of immature neurons in the brains of 2 week-old mice and to perturb neurodevelopment- and neural structure-related pathways within neurons. In 8 week-old mice, Pb primarily influenced pathways implicated in synaptic transmission, signal transduction, and learning and memory in both neurons and glial cells. The communication involving neurotransmitters glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), along with their receptors, was disrupted between neuron and microglia. Through the application of snRNA-seq, this study has demonstrated that the Pb-induced neurotoxicity is characterized by cellular heterogeneity and the disruption of neurotransmitter-related communication between microglia and neurons could be a critical factor in Pb-induced neurotoxicity."

In this study, HT-EDA has been implemented to identify the main effect-drivers (testosterone, androsterone and norgestrel) from hospital effluent using microplate fractionation, the AR-CALUX bioassay and an efficient data processing workflow. Through nontargeted screening, over 5000 features (ESI+) were initially detected, but our workflow’s prioritization based on androgenic activity prediction reduced the number of features requiring further analysis by over 95%, significantly streamlining the workload. In addition, the semiquantitative nontarget analysis allowed for the calculation of the contribution of an identified compound to the total activity of the sample without the need for reference standards. While this contribution was low (∼4.3%) and applicable to only one compound (1,4-androstadiene-3,17-dione), it presents the first approach for calculating such contributions without relying on standards.

However, as a crucial component in high-performance PSCs, highly toxic lead may leak from discarded PSCs and cause environmental and health risks. Implementing the effective recovery of lead from discarded PSCs is crucial for the sustainable development of the PSC industry.

This study proposes a facile ultrasonic water leaching technique for effectively recovering lead from the glass substrate of discarded PSCs. During the ultrasonic water leaching process, the perovskite layer undergoes rapid degradation, generating PbI2. Most of the PbI2 dissolves in the water, yielding a leaching solution containing a low lead concentration, while a minor fraction is converted into insoluble Pb(OH)I particles. The cumulative Pb removal ratio from the first two cycles of ultrasonic water leaching processes can reach 99.84%.

This study investigates later-generation SOA formation from the reactions of three first-generation sesquiterpene ozonolysis products (β-nocaryophyllinic acid, 2-(2-carboxyethyl)-3,3-dimethylcyclobutane-carboxylic acid, and 2-(2-methyl-6-oxoheptan-3-yl)-3,6-dioxoheptanal) with the OH radical. These compounds were synthesized specifically for this study. Our results demonstrate that sesquiterpene-derived SOA can become progressively more oxidized as it reacts with OH, with an average oxygen-to-carbon (O:C) ratio of approximately 0.6, in contrast with previous studies, suggesting considerably lower ratios. As the first-generation products continue to react, the corresponding SOA aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) mass spectrum changes by 20–25° compared to that of the fresh SOA. This suggests that quantifying the sesquiterpene SOA under ambient conditions based on its ozonolysis products may be problematic. To account for these observations, we propose and test a physicochemical model describing the processes that convert first-generation sesquiterpene SOA into highly oxidized compounds. Our analysis suggests that approximately two-thirds of carbon in the ozonolysis SOA follows functionalization pathways.

Previous studies have demonstrated associations of temperature with fall risk, but the effect and burden of hourly relative humidity and fall morbidity have been rarely investigated. Fall data and meteorological data were collected from the National Injury Surveillance System during 2006–2021 in China. Associations between hourly relative humidity and fall onset were analyzed using conditional logistic regression combined with a distributed lag nonlinear model. Stratified analysis was used to identify potential association modifiers. Several sensitivity analyses were applied to examine the robustness of the results. The study involved 4 197 495 fall-related cases. Relative humidity exhibited monotonic relationships with the fall onset risk. The excess risk (ER) of falls appeared immediately at lag 0 h and persisted for 8 h. A 10% decrease in relative humidity was associated with a 1.35% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83–1.87%) increase in excess risk of falls and much higher risk for males (ER = 1.89%, 95% CI: 1.29–2.48%) than that for females (ER = 0.52%, 95% CI: 0.14–0.90%). The excess risk of fall injury was the highest among individuals aged 5–14 years (ER = 3.45%, 95% CI: 2.57–4.32%) compared to other age groups. Moreover, compared to the highest relative humidity, the attributable fraction (AF) due to low relative humidity exposure was 4.94% (95% CI: 4.88–4.98%). Subgroup analyses revealed that males, individuals aged 5–14 years, students, cases occurring in public places, and cases engaged in sports activities were more susceptible to relative humidity than their correspondents. Regional disparities were observed, with individuals in southern China or warm regions showing greater sensitivity to changes in relative humidity. Results of this study suggest that hourly low relative humidity exposure is associated with an increased risk of fall onset. These findings underscore the necessity of time-specific interventions to mitigate the relative humidity risk."

Here, we first analyzed the constituents of e-cigarette liquid (e-liquid) and e-liquid vaping-produced aerosols (e-aerosols) by gas chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC/Q-TOF MS) and inductively coupled plasma-MS (ICP-MS), and our result indicated that the components of e-aerosols differed from those of e-liquid. However, there is insufficient evidence on the toxicity of e-aerosols; therefore, an animal study was conducted accordingly. Mice were exposed to e-aerosols for 30, 60, or 90 days within a whole-body exposure chamber equipped with an air quality monitor. Compared with the control, weakened lung function and fiber deposition in murine lungs were observed following e-cigarette exposure. Microcomputed tomography (Micro-CT) images suggested fibrosis-like lesions in the lungs. Mechanistically, the expression of the core circadian rhythm gene, per1, was significantly inhibited by e-aerosols, which is negatively correlated with interleukin-6 (IL6) expression and resulted in continuous IL6+ macrophage infiltration in the lungs during both daytime and night. Eventually, the knockout of il6 expression could completely resist e-aerosol-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Our results raise concerns regarding the role of circadian rhythm in regulating pulmonary fibrosis and the potential damages of e-cigarette consumption."

Consequently, human exposure to VMS through inhalation or other routes poses potential health risks. To provide insights for environmental contamination by VMS and its concerning health risks, a systematic literature search was conducted in online databases, including the Web of Science, PubMed, Elsevier ScienceDirect, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure. This review analyzed contamination levels of VMS in various environmental matrices, including air, dust, water, and soil. It further summarized health risk assessments for different external exposure pathways. The exacerbation of VMS pollution is predominantly linked to the increase in atmospheric concentrations, resulting in health risks primarily driven by inhalation exposure. Vulnerable groups require greater attention as their daily intake levels may potentially approach the reference dose, including occupational populations and children residing in areas near factories. Currently, data on long-term and simultaneous environmental monitoring of VMS remain limited. Furthermore, there is a lack of established exposure guidance values, due to insufficient toxicity data and limited risk quantification methods. Therefore, advancing monitoring technologies and networks for VMS and their transformation products is crucial. Future efforts should prioritize integrating advanced tools, such as mixture toxicity models, to achieve more accurate quantification of health risks under complex exposure scenarios. Overall, this review sheds light on developing and revising regulatory frameworks for governing the production and handling of VMS, as well as guiding the health risk assessment."

Previous studies have demonstrated the adverse effects of pesticide exposure on lipid metabolism. However, population studies have focused primarily on individual pesticides and have short-term fluctuations, and the animal experiments used doses far higher than those exposed by the general population. In this study, urinary concentrations of metabolites of three classes of pesticides, including organophosphate, pyrethroid, and phenoxy carboxylic acid, were determined in 1858 participants of repeated cross-sectional biomonitoring programs from 2018 to 2022. We comprehensively analyzed the association of pesticide metabolites and pesticide exposure patterns with lipid metabolism biomarkers. The indirect effects of liver function markers in these associations were explored by using the structural equation model analysis. Generalized linear models showed that 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol and para-nitrophenol were positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride. In contrast, 3-phenoxybenzoic acid was negatively correlated with apolipoprotein B. Quantile g-computation and Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression showed a consistent gradual increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels but a gradual decrease in apolipoprotein B levels with increasing exposure to pesticide mixtures. By analyzing the exposure patterns of different categories of pesticides, we found that the population has a high level of exposure to organophosphate pesticides, which disrupts lipid metabolism more significantly than other pesticides. Liver function exhibited significant mediating effects in the association between pesticide exposure and lipid metabolism biomarkers. The results indicated that pesticide exposure was significantly associated with lipid metabolism, and this association may be modulated by improvements in liver function."

Studies in various regions of the world have shown that meteorological factors influence indoor radon concentration either directly or indirectly. Seasonal variations in radon levels have been observed, with winter concentrations exceeding summer levels by 2–5 times, while extreme weather events further impact radon exhalation.

While the endocrine-disrupting effects of PFCs are well-recognized, the structure–activity relationship with respect to vascular function has not been investigated yet. This study addresses this critical gap by investigating the impact of PFCs on endothelial cell function, a key determinant of cardiovascular health. Through a machine learning-based quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) model, we analyzed 16 structural descriptors for 23 environmentally prevalent PFCs with respect to their binding affinities to endothelial cell receptors. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm suggested short-chain PFCs with strong acid groups may as particularly detrimental to endothelial cells, a finding substantiated by subsequent cell culture experiments. We also integrated computational and experimental approaches, providing a detailed understanding of the structure–activity and dose–response relationships of PFCs. Furthermore, the population health risk assessment, linking in vitro adverse effect with in vivo exposure data, indicated differences in risks across countries due to the global shift in the fluoride industry; the entire Chinese population is at high risk, with risk varying by gender and industrialization level.

The concentrations of circulating omega-3 PUFA (including total omega-3 and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) were measured by using a targeted high-throughput nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics platform. Land-use regression models were used to estimate concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) for each individual. Additionally, systemic inflammation levels were assessed using the low-grade inflammation score (INFLA-score) to elucidate the potential mechanism. We noted that the observed effects could be modified by circulating omega-3 PUFA levels (P-interaction < 0.05). Specifically, the significant pollutants-COPD associations were mainly observed in the lower circulating omega-3 PUFA groups. In contrast, there was no statistical evidence for increased COPD risk associated with air pollutants in subjects with higher circulating omega-3 PUFA.

Exposure to sources of BFR contamination (soil, feed, and water) could be the main cause of high BFR levels in chickens. α-HBCD and bis-substituted TBBPA analogues have higher bioaccumulation factor levels than TBBPA and other compounds, indicating greater bioconcentration potential for substances with higher logKow. HBCDs, TBBPA, and TBBPA analogues tend to be enriched in the chicken comb and spleen and can cross the blood–brain barrier into the brain. However, while these compounds accumulate in the mother, they are also subject to metabolic processes that lead to their eventual excretion. Low-persistence BFRs were more favorable to maternal transfer, while compounds with high persistence tended to be retained in the mother.

However, quantifying the seasonal iron cycle is challenging, as observations of bioavailable, dissolved iron (DFe) from individual campaigns rarely span a full seasonal cycle. Here, we present a composite seasonal cycle constructed from 27 years of DFe observations at the subantarctic Southern Ocean Time Series (SOTS) south of Australia. Iron measurements are paired with time series data to explain the iron cycle contextualized to broader Southern Ocean biogeochemistry. Three distinct phases were revealed with clear coupling between iron and productivity in the first two phases. In the first phase, light limitation initially controls spring to summer primary production with shoaling of the mixed layer, accounting for around half of annual net community production (ANCP). In the second phase and remaining half of ANCP, rapid biomass increases and near‐complete drawdown of DFe drive iron limitation, evidenced by maximum fluorescence‐to‐chlorophyll ratios. A subset of this period covering a third of ANCP exhibits a mean Fe:C uptake ratio of 31.08 ± 8.88 μmol:mol. During the third phase, iron is weakly coupled to productivity as the system transitions to net heterotrophy and biomass declines despite increased Fe supply associated with the east Australian current system. Together, 27 years of continuous monitoring draws a comprehensive picture of how and when iron fuels subantarctic productivity, providing a critical baseline for model validation and continued monitoring in a rapidly changing climate."

Jones;Christopher Daly;Mark Schulze;Christopher J. Stlll,"Microclimate Refugia Are Transient in Stable Old Forests, Pacific Northwest, USA","An issue of global concern is how climate change forcing is transmitted to ecosystems. Forest ecosystems in mountain landscapes may demonstrate buffering and perhaps decoupling of long‐term rates of temperature change, because vegetation, topography, and local winds (e.g., cold air pooling) influence temperature and potentially create microclimate refugia (areas which are relatively protected from climate change). We tested these ideas by comparing 45‐year regional rates of air temperature change to unique temporal and spatial air temperature records in the understory of regionally representative stable old forest at the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon, USA. The 45‐year seasonal patterns and rates of warming were similar throughout the forested landscape and matched regional rates observed at 88 standard meteorological stations in Oregon and Washington, indicating buffering, but not decoupling of long‐term climate change rates. Consideration of the energy balance explains these results: while shading and airflows produce spatial patterns of temperature, these processes do not counteract global increases in air temperature driven by increased downward, longwave radiation forced by increased anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In some months, the 45‐year warming in the forest understory equaled or exceeded spatial differences of air temperature between the understory and the canopy or canopy openings and was comparable to temperature change over 1,000 m elevation, while in other months there has been little change. These findings have global implications because they indicate that microclimate refugia are transient, even in this forested mountain landscape."

Traditionally, quantitative climatic measures of storm activity have been mostly based on Eulerian measures, taking into account the mean state of the atmosphere and how those affect Eulerian eddy activity, but they do not consider the Lagrangian growth of the storms themselves. Here, using ERA‐5 reanalysis data and tracking all extratropical storms (cyclones and anticyclones) from 83 years of data, we examine the actual growth of the storms and compare it to the Eulerian characteristics of the background state as the storms develop. In the limit of weak baroclinicity, we find that baroclinicity provides a good measure for storm maximum intensity. However, this monotonic relationship breaks for high baroclinicity levels. We show that although the actual growth rate of individual storms monotonically increases with baroclinicity, the reduction in maximum intensity at high baroclinicity is caused by a decrease in storm growth time. Based on the Lagrangian analysis, we suggest a nonlinear correction to the traditional linear connection between baroclinicity and storms' activity. Then, we show that a simplified model of storm growth, incorporating the baroclinicity effect on the vertical tilt of anomalies, reproduces the observed nonlinear relationship.

Garny,Intrinsic Predictability From the Troposphere to the Mesosphere/Lower Thermosphere (MLT),"The atmosphere's flow becomes unpredictable beyond a certain time due to the inherent growth of small initial‐state errors. While many research studies have focused on tropospheric predictability, predictability of the middle atmosphere remains less studied. This work contrasts the intrinsic predictability of different layers, with a focus on the mesosphere/lower thermosphere (MLT, 50–120 km altitude). Ensemble simulations with the UA‐ICON model for an austral winter/spring season are conducted with a gravity‐wave‐permitting horizontal resolution of 20 km. Initially small perturbations grow fastest in the MLT, reaching 10% of saturation after 5–6 days, compared to 10 days in the troposphere and 2 weeks in the stratosphere. A saturation level of 50% is reached only after about 2 weeks in the MLT, similar to the troposphere. Saturation times are overestimated in a coarser resolution model (grid size 160 km) by up to a factor of two, highlighting the need for gravity wave‐resolving models. Predictability in the MLT depends on horizontal scales. Motions on scales of hundreds of kilometers are predictable for less than 5 days, while larger scales (thousands of kilometers) remain predictable for up to 20 days. This scale‐dependent progression of predictability cannot be explained by simple scaling for upscale error growth. Vertical wave propagation plays a significant role, with gravity waves transmitting perturbations upward at early lead times and planetary waves enhancing long‐term predictability. In summary, the study shows that MLT predictability is scale‐dependent and highlights the necessity of high‐resolution models to capture fast‐growing perturbations and assess intrinsic predictability limits accurately."

Many operational NWP models often struggle with slow or no fog formation after sunset and too rapid dissipation in the morning. This study investigates the role of physical processes in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) in shaping the limitations of fog and low stratus representation within the operational ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model. Specifically, it evaluates the effects of turbulence parameterizations and vertical resolution on fog simulations. ICON simulations were conducted for selected winter periods characterized by persistent radiation fog, nocturnal fog, low stratus, and high pollutant concentrations over the Swiss Plateau. The simulations involved different configurations of the operational turbulence scheme (ICON‐TKE) and the newly developed two‐energies turbulence scheme (ICON‐2TE). The performance of these model configurations was assessed using an ABL profiler and surface observations from the Payerne weather station in Switzerland. The results indicate that ICON‐2TE, with its refined turbulence representation, allows fog to persist longer and aligns more closely with observations than ICON‐TKE. This improvement is attributed to a more sophisticated treatment of stability dependence and turbulence length scale in the ICON‐2TE scheme. Notably, an increase in vertical resolution improves fog representation in the ICON‐2TE scheme, while it shows almost no effect in the ICON‐TKE scheme. The lack of improvement in ICON‐TKE is likely due to an overestimation of turbulence mixing, which overrides the effect of changes in vertical resolution."

 Increasing combined heat and drought extremes due to climate change heighten the risk of crop failure, underscoring the need for improved stress diagnosis for effective management strategies. However, current plant physiology indicators struggle to differentiate crop stresses in hot-dry environments. This study proposes using specific leaf metabolites, detectable by leaf reflectance spectra, for more precise identification of heat and drought stress compared to traditional methods. We conducted two rounds of one-week drought treatments under heat stress on soybean seedlings. Throughout the experiment, we monitored stomatal conductance, reflectance spectra, and metabolites, including Abscisic Acid (ABA), Jasmonic Acid (JA), Salicylic Acid (SA), and proline (Pro), on a daily basis. Our findings revealed that ABA and JA exhibited differential sensitivities to drought and heat stress, respectively. In contrast, stomatal conductance was unable to differentiate between the two stressors. Using partial least-squares regression (PLSR), we determined that both ABA and JA could be detected via leaf spectroscopy with moderate predictive performance (R2 = 0.53, relative RMSE = 14.28 %; R2 = 0.53, relative RMSE = 14.96 %) and exhibited distinct sensitive spectral signatures. The metabolite-derived, stress-specific spectral models enable more precise and earlier diagnosis and differentiation of stress in a hot-dry environment than traditional physiological indicators (e.g., relying on stomatal conductance). This study provides an example of using metabolites as novel stress indicators, which could contribute to precision agriculture, offering the potential for accurate, stress-specific, and pre-physiological detection of crop health."

 Satellite land surface temperature (Ts) provides valuable information on vegetation drought stress via its physical linkage to plant stomatal activity and transpiration. New-generation geostationary satellites offer opportunities to monitor sub-diurnal variations in Ts and thus track plant physiological stress response occurring at sub-daily timescales. Nevertheless, the potential of satellite Ts and its derived metrics for early detection of vegetation drought stress before visible canopy changes occur has not been widely assessed. Here, we developed a parsimonious Surface-Air Temperature Difference Anomaly (SATDA) method for tracking vegetation drought stress using the cumulative sub-diurnal difference from late-morning to early-afternoon between Ts from the Himawari-8 geostationary satellite and hourly air temperature (Ta) from meteorological grids. SATDA utilised Ts−Ta as the physical driving gradient for sensible heat flux (H) to capture anomalous sensible heating due to reduced plant transpiration. We used SATDA to monitor the spatio-temporal patterns of the 2017–2019 Tinderbox Drought in southeast Australia. We benchmarked the skill of SATDA in forecasting visible drought-induced vegetation greenness decline against both conventional water availability-based indices (i.e., precipitation and soil moisture anomalies) and existing satellite Ts indices (i.e., Temperature Condition Index and Temperature Rise Index) across diverse climates and land covers. SATDA effectively captured a rapidly intensifying flash drought event at multi-week timescales (Jul to Sep 2019) embedded within the multi-year Tinderbox Drought, which contributed to detrimental impacts on agricultural production and increased wildfire risk. SATDA showed the best vegetation greenness forecast skill in the transitional semi-arid and sub-humid climates, with forecast correlation >0.5 at 32-day lead time. The advantage over water availability-based indices was more evident in woody-dominated ecosystems than herbaceous-dominated ecosystems, likely due to the importance of physiological regulations by trees during droughts such as deeper roots and stronger stomatal control. SATDA, based on Ts−Ta, showed overall better vegetation greenness forecasts than two Ts-only indices, especially in woody vegetation. Finally, SATDA showed consistently greater advantage over water availability-based and Ts-only indices in forecasting visible vegetation decline as the drought intensity increased. The parsimonious process-based SATDA method suits global-scale operational implementation to complement vegetation drought monitoring and early warning systems."

 Restoring natural ecosystems has the potential to remove billions of tons of CO2 annually through the end of the century, but rigorously measuring the climate impacts of restoration activities on the ground remains elusive. Ecosystem restoration interventions across hundreds or thousands of smallholder properties require robust above-ground biomass (AGB) products at high spatial (deca-metric: 10–30 m) resolution for annual monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV). In addition to ongoing monitoring, historical AGB time series across the region are also necessary. Historical maps are for example needed for eligibility checks and the selection of appropriate counterfactuals, i.e., to establish a dynamic performance benchmark. We present a novel AGB product based on a recently developed foundation model leveraging progress in self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques from multi-spectral Earth Observation (EO) time series. The foundation model is non-contrastive and condenses all available spectral observations acquired within a year into a few, orthogonal and highly informative representations at 10 m (for Sentinel-2) and 30 m (for Landsat 7/8). Combined with spatially sparse Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) full-waveform measurements at two relative heights (RH95 and RH10), but otherwise without any further fine-tuning, we are able to estimate forest biomass with an RMSE of <25 Mg/ha, when validated against 38 in-situ AGB measurement sites across a range of agroforestry (cacao and oil palm) and restoration age classes. Compared to five openly available datasets – most of them not available at annual time steps – our approach reduces the RMSE by 15–55%. We demonstrate the scalability of our approach, by producing annual AGB maps covering the entire state of Para, Brazil, for the years 2013 to 2024. The approach is computationally efficient, fully self-supervised without relying on contrastive samples, and can therefore be scaled to global coverage, even under conditions of high cloudiness."

 This study integrates a dynamic plant growth model with a three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer model (RTM) for maize traits retrieval using high spatial–spectral resolution airborne data. The research combines the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model with the Dynamic L-System-based Architectural maize (DLAmaize) growth model to simulate field reflectance. Comparison with the 1D RTM SAIL revealed limitations in representing row structure effects, field slope, and complex light–canopy interactions. Novel Global Sensitivity Analyses (GSA) were carried out using dependence-based methods to overcome limitations of traditional variance-based approaches, enabling better characterization of hyperspectral sensitivity to changes in leaf biochemistry, canopy architecture, and soil moisture. GSA provided complementary results to assess estimation uncertainties of the proposed traits retrieval method across growth stages. A hybrid inversion framework combining DART simulations with an active learning strategy using Kernel Ridge Regression was implemented for traits estimation. The approach was validated using ground data and HyPlant-DUAL airborne hyperspectral images from two field campaigns in 2018 and achieved high retrieval accuracy of key maize traits: leaf area index (LAI, R2=0.91, RMSE=0.42 m2/m2), leaf chlorophyll content (LCC, R2=0.61, RMSE=3.89 μg/cm2), leaf nitrogen content (LNC, R2=0.86, RMSE=1.13 × 10−2 mg/cm2), leaf dry matter content (LMA, R2=0.84, RMSE=0.15 mg/cm2), and leaf water content (LWC, R2=0.78, RMSE=0.88 mg/cm2). The validated models were used to generate two-date 10 m resolution maps, showing good spatial consistency and traits dynamics. The findings demonstrate that integrating 3D RTMs with dynamic growth models is suited for maize trait mapping from hyperspectral data in varying growing conditions."

 Accurate knowledge of vegetation water content (VWC) and crop height is crucial for agricultural management, environmental monitoring, and for satellite-based retrieval algorithms for geophysical variables. Traditional methods to estimate VWC, primarily rely on optical indices, which has limitations of biomass saturation, and sensitivity to atmospheric conditions. This study introduces a novel application of geospatial foundation models (GFMs), leveraging extensive, unlabeled datasets through self-supervised learning to enhance the skill of VWC and crop height estimation.

For VWC estimation, STL-GFM achieved R2 values of 0.90 and 0.89 for soybean and corn, respectively. For crop height, R2 values reached 0.95 for soybean and 0.98 for corn. The integration of SAR, optical, and climate data provided more reliable estimations than using individual data sources.Feature importance analysis identified NDVI, NDWI, VH backscatter, and precipitation as key drivers for accurate VWC and height estimations. The red-edge band emerged as significant for VWC estimation but showed limited importance for height prediction. Notably, surface roughness demonstrated a noticeable impact on corn VWC and height estimations, while soil moisture exhibited less influence than initially anticipated. Notably, without directly incorporating soil moisture and surface roughness data, but by including diverse field conditions in training and validation, the STL-GFM model demonstrated strong generalization capabilities. This study highlights the potential of GFMs in advancing crop monitoring techniques, offering more reliable data for precision agriculture, and supporting sustainable farming practices across diverse agricultural landscapes."

 As one of the critical parameters in the land-atmosphere exchange processes, land surface temperature (LST) plays an essential role in various domains, such as climate change, urban heat island effect, disaster monitoring, and evaporation retrieval. Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing is one of the main approaches to obtaining LST on a large scale. For the sensors with only one TIR channel, the single-channel (SC) methods are commonly and effectively used to retrieve LST, as they are most suitable under such limitations. However, atmospheric correction is essential for the SC methods, which involves significant uncertainty and complexity. To reduce the atmospheric dependency of SC methods, this study proposes a Correlation-Hypothesis based Single-Channel (CH-SC) method to retrieve LST. In this method, the LST can be retrieved using the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) brightness temperature from a single TIR channel and the LSEs from two virtual adjacent channels, while atmospheric water vapor content (WVC) is used solely to assess atmospheric conditions. Consequently, the CH-SC method exhibits the least sensitive in atmospheric parameter errors compared to existing SC methods. This inherent robustness results in superior stability of retrieval accuracy, enhancing its practicality for real applications. Subsequently, the CH-SC method was applied to Landsat 7 data, alongside the mono-window (MW) method and generalized single-channel (GSC) method. The retrieved LSTs were compared with in-situ measurements for validation. As a result, the CH-SC method exhibited strong performance compared to in-situ measurements, with an RMSE of 2.83 K in SURFRAD sites and 4.02 K in BSRN sites, which was comparable to Landsat 7 LST product (3.15 K at SURFRAD and 4.26 K at BSRN) and outperforming other SC methods. Generally, compared to the existing methods, the proposed method exhibits minimal dependence on atmospheric information while ensuring superior accuracy and stability, even under high water vapor conditions. That holds significant application value, especially for the sensors with limited TIR channels to enable real-time on-orbit computation of LST."

 Radiative transfer models (RTM) enable the simulation of remote sensing observations and can therefore be useful for sensitivity analyses and model inversions, for example to determine the biophysical properties of vegetation. For this purpose, the calculation of observation derivatives is crucial. In this study, we propose to differentiate vegetation RTM based on Monte Carlo Ray tracing, PolVRT, as a function of the leaf area index (LAI). The variation of LAI is done considering the average leaf area (u). The difference between simulations corresponding to two areas close to each other (u and u′) is used to calculate the derivative as the limit when u′ approaches u. We propose in this work to adjust traced paths for u to simulate (u′), but such paths are weighted to correct their bias. This weighting is based on the technique of Importance Sampling. It increases the weighting of likely paths and conversely decreases it of unlikely ones. We have made a correction for the hot spot effect, since there is a strong dependency between the incident and backscattered paths.

 An up-to-date, detailed global urban land use map is essential for disclosing urban structures and dynamics as well as their differences across different regions. However, generating an accurate global urban land use map remains challenging due to the complex diversity of land use types and the uneven availability of data. Existing methods, which either rely solely on remote sensing imagery or treat supplementary data like point-of-interest (POI) as mandatory inputs, fail to account for regional data disparities and the complex relationships between different data modalities. In this study, we propose an urban land use mapping framework optimized with POI prompts. First, we acquire global urban Sentinel-2 imagery, POI data, and labeled LU samples from Google Earth Engine (GEE) and OpenStreetMap (OSM), and then propose a POI-Prompt Urban Land-use Mapping Network (PPUL-Net), which utilizes POI prompts to enhance classification accuracy and produce reliable predictions in those regions lacking POI data. Consequently, a global land use dataset (GULU) with a 10 m resolution in 2020 has been produced at the first time. Experimental results show that GULU has an overall accuracy of 84.59 %, demonstrating robust performance across continents. Incorporating POI data improved the accuracies for some challenging categories, such as commercial and institutional lands, by 7.32 % and 17.66 %, respectively. Additionally, using POI as prompts instead of direct pixel-level fusion with imagery increased accuracy by 2.92 %. Finally, analysis of the GULU dataset reveals that Europe and North America exhibit high land use diversity, implying mature urban structures, whereas sub-Saharan Africa and South America are predominantly characterized by residential and undeveloped areas.

To address this issue, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning approach, Semi-MeshSeg, to tackle the problem of insufficiently labeled data. Urban meshes are irregular and susceptible to distortion, leading to blurred boundaries and surface features. To solve this challenge, we introduce a novel semi-supervised method for 3D mesh semantic segmentation, capable of leveraging all pseudo-labels, rather than relying solely on a small subset of high-confidence ones, to more effectively capture the inherent variability and irregularity of urban meshes. Given that pseudo-labels, particularly low-confidence ones, often contain substantial noise, we design dual-stream perturbation branches, a noise reduction loss, and a distribution alignment loss to mitigate this noise. The dual-stream perturbation branches enhance the semantic segmentation performance of the model by exploring extensive three-dimensional (3D) perturbation spaces, while the noise reduction loss and distribution alignment loss are designed to enhance the quality of noisy pseudo-labels. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, our approach achieves superior performance with only one tile of labeled data, improving mIoU by at least 3.0% on the SUM dataset and 4.5% on the seMet dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness under limited labeled data conditions."

 The Terrestrial Ecosystem Carbon Inventory Satellite (TECIS) is the first Chinese satellite in orbit equipped with both waveform LiDAR and multi-angle imaging capabilities, dedicated to forest carbon monitoring. It has collected a large volume of waveform data. To accurately estimate canopy height using waveform data, two critical steps are identifying the effective signal range based on signal threshold settings and selecting the optimal waveform metrics processing method. The choice of waveform threshold settings and metrics calculation methods directly affects the accuracy of canopy height estimation.To optimize threshold settings and identify suitable waveform metrics calculation methods, this study focused on the northern forest region of China, using airborne laser scanning (ALS) data as a reference to evaluate TECIS canopy height estimation approaches. First, effective TECIS footprints were selected and spatially matched with ALS data. Then, 24 waveform threshold combinations and 3 metrics calculation methods were applied to derive waveform metrics, and the bias between the Relative Height (RH) metrics and ALS percentile heights was analysed. Subsequently, seven sets of waveform metrics were used to construct linear regression models for estimating the 99th percentile ALS height (P99), representing the observed maximum canopy height. Finally, the bias between RH100 and ALS P99 under different conditions was evaluated.The results showed that using a six-times start signal threshold and a twelve-times end signal threshold, combined with RH metrics calculated based on waveform decomposition and signal cut-off points, yielded the highest consistency with ALS height data. For RH metrics calculated based solely on signal cut-off points, stricter threshold settings—especially at the signal end—resulted in better agreement. In ALS P99 regression modelling, the optimal waveform metrics model achieved a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.86 when slope was not considered. Under low-slope, medium canopy cover, and night-time data acquisition conditions, the estimation bias was further reduced.This study provides a new perspective from a signal processing standpoint for improving TECIS waveform-based canopy height estimation. The findings are expected to support the development of TECIS canopy height products and promote large-scale application of wide-footprint waveform LiDAR data."

 Intertidal zones are home to critical ecosystems that provide a wide range of ecological, social and economic benefits, but are increasingly vulnerable to climate change and anthropogenic pressures. This study aims to develop a robust methodology for mapping and analysing these areas using satellite imagery, focusing on the creation of a new spectral index specifically designed for zoning marsh ecosystems. The methodology involves selecting optimal satellite data, correcting for solar reflectance, identifying intertidal pixels using the Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) and classifying these zones into categories such as seagrass beds, mudflats, low marsh and high marsh. By comparing the effectiveness of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 datasets, the research addresses common challenges in land cover mapping of intertidal environments — such as cloud cover, reflectance variability and tidal influences. The Bay of Cádiz (south-west Spain), with its extensive intertidal areas characterised by diverse habitats such as mudflats, marshes and seagrass beds, serves as an ideal case study for understanding coastal dynamics driven by tidal cycles. The results highlight the usefulness of the proposed spectral index in assessing changes in intertidal habitats over time, achieving classification accuracies of up to 93.6%, and supporting long-term monitoring efforts that are crucial for coastal conservation strategies. By refining intertidal mapping techniques and improving the detection of specific land cover classes, this research addresses existing methodological gaps and provides valuable insights for local coastal management. In future work, the methodology could be adapted to other intertidal systems and integrated with additional data sources to simulate future scenarios under sea level rise or extreme events. These improvements will help guide effective, data-driven strategies for conserving intertidal ecosystems in the face of accelerating environmental change."

 Marine microorganisms, widely distributed in seawater, can be transferred into the atmosphere through sea spray aerosols (SSA) generated by the bursting of bubbles. Considering the vast oceanic coverage on Earth, this process has significant climatic implications on regional and global scales, particularly under the influence of global warming. Using a self-constructed sea spray aerosol generation tank (SAGT), we simulated SSA production with seawater of varying salinities to investigate the transfer and enrichment of microorganisms in SSA. Our results confirm that microorganisms can be enriched in SSA. The microbial enrichment was size-dependent, with elevated enrichment factors observed in fine particles. Chlorophyll a, a proxy for marine primary production, demonstrated a significant positive correlation with microbial enrichment in submicron SSA, indicating the influence of marine biological activities. Additionally, salinity was found to play a critical role, with high salinity promoting the enrichment of microbes in SSA. Microbial cell growth in seawater should also be considered when assessing marine microbial contributions. We estimated the emission fluxes of microbial carbon via SSA production from low and high salinity seawater, and a global annual emission of marine microbes was estimated in the range of 0.68–2.50 Gg yr−1. This study underscores the importance of understanding microbial transfer through SSA production and highlights its relevance in the context of global environmental changes driven by warming, emphasizing the intricate connections between marine ecosystems and atmospheric processes."

 Drought is increasingly recognized as a severe global risk, yet the ability to predict drought remains limited, particularly in capturing early warning signals. This study breaks through the limitations of existing drought prediction by combining causal inference and multiple machine learning models from an energy perspective, as well as designing adaptive preference algorithms to establish a framework for the dynamic identification of drought propensity, which is applied to the United States, Argentina, Congo, and the Yangtze River Basin. The findings reveal a causal lag effect (4–12 months) between surface energy flux fluctuations and drought. The ability of energy fluxes to predict drought index and identify drought propensity is different in different regions and different models, which may be affected by climatic diversity. Models for the United States and Argentina achieved R2 values of 0.85–0.91, with drought propensity identification accuracy reaching up to 80 %. In contrast, the Yangtze River Basin showed lower performance, with an accuracy of 56 %. Furthermore, the energy dominant factors in different regions vary significantly. Their energy thresholds (such as the net radiation of the United States at 132.87 W/m2 and the latent heat flux of the Yangtze River at 108.50 W/m2) and their action directions reveal the essential differences in the land-air energy distribution mechanisms in different regions. These results highlight the predictive potential of surface energy fluxes in drought events and underscore their importance for global drought prediction models. This research offers valuable insights into improving global drought prediction systems and enhancing climate risk management strategies."

 Spatially and temporally enhanced satellite precipitation products (SPPs) from the GPM mission offer a viable alternative to ground-based measurements. Although the SPPs have been extensively evaluated at specific time scales, such as hourly and daily, the temporally continuity feature of precipitation events is often overlooked. This study assessed and intercompared the performance of six GPM hourly SSPs, i.e. Early, Late and Final from IMERG, and NRT, MVK, NRT_GC (hereafter GC) from GSMaP, focusing on capturing three key precipitation properties (i.e. depth, duration and intensity) along with peak magnitude and timing, in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of their capability and potential for precipitation monitoring and related hydrometeorological applications. The minimum inter-event time (MIT) approach, with a range of threshold values (i.e. 1, 2, 6, 10 and 24 h), was adopted to delineate precipitation events for the SSPs and the reference data (site observations and CLDAS datasets). IMERG and GSMaP products revealed their respective strengths in detection capacity of precipitation events, with IMERG achieving lower FAR and GSMaP showing higher POD. Despite comparable capabilities in estimating the depth of precipitation events by all the SPPs, IMERG products tended to be more effective in characterizing precipitation intensity and event peak while GSMaP better identified event duration. Notably, near/post real-time products outperformed gauge-corrected versions in certain aspects. Early was more capable of capturing event-based precipitation properties compared to the other IMERG products, especially for shorter MITs, suggesting the potential of near-real-time products in precipitation monitoring and early warning of associated hazards. In addition, MVK excelled in characterizing event duration, intensity, and peak magnitude within the GSMaP system, revealing the possible effectiveness of gauge-free satellite retrieval algorithms. Subregion analysis using the K-means clustering algorithm demonstrated the integrated influence of multiple factors on the performance of the SPPs, also with region-dependent sensitivity to a specific factor. The findings obtained from this study could provide new insights into the practical application and possible further enhancement of the GPM SPPs."

 This study comprehensively evaluates the performance of ERA5 and MERRA-2 reanalysis datasets in representing key meteorological parameters consisting of air temperature, mean sea level pressure, and relative humidity across Türkiye between 2010 and 2023. By comparing reanalysis data to observations from 116 meteorological stations, the analysis provides critical insights into their spatial and seasonal accuracy, revealing notable strengths and limitations. The findings confirm that ERA5 consistently outperforms MERRA-2 across all three parameters, exhibiting higher determination coefficients (R2), lower root mean square errors (RMSE), and reduced mean bias errors (MBE), particularly for air temperature and relative humidity. ERA5 demonstrated superior performance in temperature representation, with seasonal R2 values ranging from 0.85 to 0.91, while MERRA-2 exhibited lower performance, ranging from 0.75 to 0.86. Similarly, ERA5 outperformed MERRA-2 in relative humidity estimation, achieving R2 values between 0.50 and 0.75, compared to MERRA-2's lower range of 0.33 to 0.62. Both datasets performed comparably for mean sea level pressure; however, ERA5 achieved slightly lower RMSE and MBE values, particularly in winter and regions with complex topography, where MERRA-2 systematically underestimated pressure. The seasonal and spatial analyses highlight ERA5's finer spatial resolution and enable a more accurate representation of meteorological variability, particularly in topographically complex and coastal regions. Its reduced systematic biases and improved accuracy in transitional seasons underscore its suitability for high-resolution applications, such as urban climate modeling, air quality research, and hydrological simulations. Conversely, MERRA-2, with its coarser grid and pronounced biases in colder months, remains suitable for broader-scale climatological studies but may require bias correction for localized applications."

 Atmospheric heatwave events have substantial socioeconomic impacts, which have been widely studied under global climate change. This study investigates the characteristics and differences between long-lived and short-lived heatwave events (LHWs and SHWs). First, we identify heatwave events over the Western North America (WNA) over 1981–2022 and categorize them based on the 90th percentile of their duration parameter. Then, we reveal that the LHWs exhibit stronger surface warming with a stronger and thicker warm layer. Circulation anomalies show an anomalous ridge above the WNA, which is more persistent with a greater central value of positive geopotential height anomalies for LHWs. Furthermore, we reveal the important role of mid-to-high-latitude teleconnection in maintaining the LHWs. We find that the diabatic heating released by increased precipitation near Japan can excite Rossby wave trains crossing the Pacific Ocean, and then reach North America, which contributes to maintaining the anomalous ridge of LHWs. Moreover, positive diabatic heating anomalies, related to land-atmosphere interaction, in Central Siberia are also favorable for the generation or persistence of the anomalous ridge and thus the LHWs. Finally, we validate the above teleconnection mechanisms by using the linear baroclinic model and Community Atmosphere Model 5.0 model. By comparison, there is negligible cross-Pacific propagation of Rossby wave energy before the peak of SHWs. This study presents evidence of climate linkages of East Asia and Central Siberia with WNA, which may provide potential predictability for LHWs over the WNA."

 The Mentawai Islands, located in the eastern Indian Ocean approximately 150 km west of Sumatera, experience precipitation patterns heavily influenced by the eastward propagation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). This study investigates the impact of the MJO on local precipitation patterns, with a specific focus on diurnal cycles, during the rainy season (November–March, NDJFM). The analysis is based on Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) data spanning from 2000 to 2022. It emphasizes diurnal patterns through the lens of precipitation amount (PA), precipitation frequency (PF), and precipitation intensity (PI). The size of the islands strongly shapes the diurnal precipitation patterns during the rainy season. On Siberut, the largest island, two pronounce precipitation peaks are observed: one in the afternoon (15 LST) and another in the early morning (04 LST). Two precipitation peaks were also observed in South Pagai, with an earlier early morning peak (02 LST) and an early afternoon peak (13 LST), exhibiting weaker afternoon peak values compared to those in Siberut. The early afternoon precipitation peak on larger islands suggests a dominant role of local convection in the diurnal precipitation system of the Mentawai Islands. In contrast, the smaller islands—Sipora and North Pagai—exhibit a single precipitation peak at 02 LST, dominated primarily by offshore precipitation propagation from Sumatera. The presence of the Mentawai Islands has been observed to disrupt the offshore propagation of convective systems during nighttime, as indicated by the disruption of PI propagation. However, this disruption becomes negligible when nighttime low-level winds from Sumatera strengthen during MJO phases 2–3. During these enhanced phases, the intensified offshore propagation from Sumatera significantly impacts both the peak values and timings of early morning precipitation in the Mentawai Islands. The enhancement of offshore precipitation propagation during phases 2–3 shifts the peak timing of early morning precipitation in the Mentawai mainland forward by 2 h. This shift in peak timing is particularly pronounced on the smaller islands, where stronger low-level winds associated with the MJO enhance precipitation propagation toward the Mentawai Islands. Understanding the MJO's influence on precipitation patterns in this region is critical for improving weather prediction models and enhancing preparedness for extreme weather events."

 The present study investigates the temporal variation in the connection between Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) and Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) during 1980–2023. The ISMR shows an insignificant correlation with the preceding October–November–December–January (OND(−1)J(0)) Greenland Sea SIC (GSSIC) during 1980–2001, whereas the relationship turns to be significant positive during 2002–2023. During this latter period, the increasing GSSIC in preceding OND(−1)J(0) can exert wave trains that travel from North Atlantic to northeast Pacific, inducing anomalous anticyclone and cyclone over northeast of Hawaii and southwest of Mexico, respectively. This, in turn, generates a dipole sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) over northeast Pacific, with positive SSTA northeast of Hawaii and negative SSTA southwest of Mexico. The Wind-Evaporation-SST (WES) feedback helps maintain this dipole SSTA through to the following June–July–August–September, contributing to the negative SSTA over north central tropical Pacific (NCTP). The negative NCTP SSTA can induce anomalous ascending motion over the western Pacific–Indian Ocean by modulating Walker circulation, ultimately leading to increase ISMR. In contrast, during 1980–2001, GSSIC shows stronger co-variation with North Atlantic dipole (NAD) SSTA compared with that during 2002–2023. Due to the response of atmospheric circulation anomalies to the GSSIC are nearly opposite to those in terms of the NAD SSTA, the influence of the GSSIC anomalies on the wave trains over Northern Hemisphere is disturbed. Therefore, the GSSIC anomalies can slightly impact on the SSTA over northeast Pacific, resulting in weaker GSSIC-ISMR relationship."

 Using radar observation data together with ERA5 reanalysis data, this study exposes the mesocyclone characteristics of supercells associated with extreme flash heavy rainfall (FHR, hourly rainfall intensity ≥50 mm) in Jiangsu Province of China during 2020–2021, and reveals their differences from other severe supercells associated with convective hazards such as hail, gales and tornadoes. The results show that most FHR supercells occur in July and August, seasonally later than hail supercells or gale supercells in this region. During the warm season, FHR supercells generally move eastward led by westerly flow since most of them appear along the north edge of the western Pacific subtropical high. Half of FHR supercell mesocyclones sustain only about 2–3 radar volume scans (12–18 min). Most extreme FHR supercells are embedded in mesoscale convective systems and are triggered at more favorable locations where more abundant moisture converges and stronger low-level vertical wind shear is produced. In comparison, the developing extreme FHR supercell generally needs more abundant moisture but not as much higher convective available potential energy or stronger vertical wind shear as hail or gale supercells. In terms of mesocyclone characteristics, tornadic supercells exhibit the strongest rotation intensity, followed by gale and hail supercells, and FHR supercells possess the weakest rotation intensity. Hail supercells have the largest storm diameter, deepest mesocyclone, and highest elevation of strongest rotation, followed by gale supercells, FHR supercells and tornadic supercells. These differences are possibly related to the distinct formation mechanisms of the various severe convective phenomena induced by supercell: hail grows in lower ambient temperature and therefore corresponds to the highest vertical extension of supercell; the majority of convective windstorms in the Yangtze-Huai River region is associated with mid-upper-level dry air entraining into the storm and triggering a strong evaporative effect; and the definition of a tornadic supercell implies that the least diameter and the strongest rotation must approach ground. In contrast, most FHR events in this region are linked to warm-rain processes."

 Drought will cause huge losses to humans. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore the factors that control drought, and the changes that cause it in the context of global warming. Although drought is controlled by multiple factors, few studies have comprehensively considered the multiple controlling factors' effects at different time scales. For the Haihe River Basin (northern China), we investigated trends in meteorological drought and associated meteorological and atmospheric circulation factors for 1960–2017 using Mann-Kendall tests and wavelet transform coherence (WTC) analysis. Multiple wavelet coherence analysis was used to examine the multiple factors' combined effects at different time scales. The Standard Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index, an index of drought, decreased by 0.138 per decade, and the climate became warmer and drier over the 58 years. The meteorological factors with the greatest influence on drought were relative humidity (RH), the combination of mean temperature (Tmean) and RH, and the combination of Tmean, RH, and sunshine duration. Atmospheric circulation factors most affecting drought were the Arctic Oscillation (AO), the combination of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and AO, and the combination of AO, PDO, and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).

The impact of meteorological on drought was greater than that of the atmospheric circulation factors. More research on teleconnections of drought signals is needed to prevent drought."

 Typhoon-induced heavy rainfall can lead to severe flooding, causing significant damage to social systems. Although machine learning (ML) offers an efficient approach for typhoon rainfall forecasting, individual models often exhibit considerable uncertainty. To address this, this study proposes a robust typhoon rainfall forecasting model based on Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) with four ML models including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), K-Nearest Neighbors Regression (KNN), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) across 0–6 h lead time. The model incorporates three types of features within the typhoon impact area (radius of 400 km): typhoon characteristics, grid spatial attributes and meteorological characteristics. Typhoon characteristics of each grid are dynamically weighted to reflect the weakening typhoon impacts with increasing distance from the typhoon center. Based on these features, multiple scenarios consisting of two experiments (Input Unchanged (IU) and Rolling Forecast (RO)) paired with various input designs (ALL: all features, SHAP3: 3 most critical variables, and LAG4: 4 lagged rainfall) are designed to explore the performance of all models. Case study of 28 typhoons affecting Guangdong Province from 2020 to 2023 clearly demonstrated that the weighted typhoon wind speed contributed the most in typhoon rainfall forecasting, and the BMA approach significantly enhanced the forecast accuracy. Leveraging sufficient effective information as model inputs could significantly improve the predictive performance of individual models in long-term forecasting. This method could provide flexible and suitable scenario options for data-rich and data-scarce regions, supporting early disaster warning during typhoon-prone seasons."

 On 8 August 2022, a quasi-stationary mesoscale convective system (MCS) produced prolonged extreme rainfall (> 100 mm h−1) over the Seoul metropolitan area, Republic of Korea. These organized convective systems, primarily composed of convective components with interspersed stratiform elements, are characterized by the successive local generations of convective cells. This study analyzes data from multiple observational platforms to understand the formation of the MCS and its microphysical evolution. The convective cells were initiated just off the west coast near Seoul, along the boundary between warm and cold air masses. Low-level convergence and favorable environmental conditions, including low lifting condensation level, level of free convection, and large convective available potential energy, facilitated the triggering of these cells. As the cells moved inland, they intensified rapidly due to the land-sea surface-friction contrast. Radar data show that as the MCS matured, reflectivity increased and the differential reflectivity decreased downward above the melting level, indicating the growth of ice crystals and graupels. The evolution of microphysical structure led to increases in both the mean diameter (Dm) and the number concentration (NT) of raindrops. This observation also suggests that the rainfall intensity was more closely related to the increase in NT than Dm during the period of heavy downpours. This study improves our understanding of the mesoscale processes related to extreme rainfall in Korea, critical for forecasting local heavy rainfall."

 Anthropogenic influence have led to an increase in the frequency of compound dry and hot events (CDHEs) globally under the background of global warming. However, there is limited research on the extent of anthropogenic influence on the spatial extent of CDHEs. Our analysis, focusing on the changes in the affected area of CDHEs across the global land during the warm season from 1961 to 2013, indicates an increasing trend in both hemispheres and six continents, with the most obviously increases observed in the Northern Hemisphere (15.8 %/53 yr), Asia (16 %/53 yr), and Africa (14 %/53 yr). Using the optimal fingerprinting method for detection and attribution analysis, we found that the anthropogenic signal was robustly detected in all regions except Oceania. The greenhouse gases emission played a major role in the observed increasing trends in all regions except Oceania. Furthermore, we conducted an event attribution analysis for the 2022–like CDHEs areas in the Northern Hemisphere, finding that nearly 95 %, 91 %, and 89 % of the trends in the Northern Hemisphere, Asia, and Europe, respectively, could be attributed to anthropogenic climate change. Using the attribution result, we constrained projections of spatial extent of CDHEs under the SSP2–4.5 and SSP5–8.5 emission scenarios. The constrained projections show a smaller increasing magnitude compared to the raw projections (except for Asia), with the largest differences observed in South America in the Southern Hemisphere. By 2100, the CDHEs areas in the Northern Hemisphere are projected to reach 43 % and 68 % under the SSP2–4.5 and SSP5–8.5 scenarios, respectively. Asia faces the most widespread impact from CHDEs, with more than 93 % under the SSP5–8.5 scenario and 56 % under the SSP2–4.5 scenario. Therefore, reducing greenhouse gas emissions has huge benefits for better mitigating the impacts of CDHEs across the global land."

 Cold air outbreaks (CAOs) are phenomena that occur across high latitudes during winter months and favor the development of extensive boundary layer clouds. As the boundary layer evolves, changes in cloud morphology often result in a stratocumulus to cumulus transition (SCT). The onset of precipitation is considered to be a key factor that leads to the break-up of the stratocumulus deck. In this modeling study we investigate the additional role that aerosols have on the SCT within a CAO event in the North Atlantic, by using prognostic fields for both aerosols and cloud droplet number concentrations (Nd). By using two chemical/aerosol schemes we assess and quantify the impact of aerosols on the SCT evolution. Our results indicate that the aerosol load and its chemical composition affect the timing of precipitation initiation and its magnitude and thus the break-up. However, the two schemes reveal contradictory results, which are mainly associated with different aerosol size and chemical composition partitioning between modes and bins. The simulations with the aerosol scheme, which considers the modal approach, show that the reduction of Nd across the SCT is driven by changes in the cloud liquid water content, the sulfate availability, and the fine sea-spray availability in the cumulus region, which suppresses sulfate activation. The Nd decreases mostly follow the decrease in accumulation-mode aerosols. For the scheme that considers the sectional approach, both the stratiform and the cumulus clouds appear sensitive to new particles formation and their competition for water. However, in the cumulus region, the higher updrafts and the greater availability of fine sea salt particles become critical for the activation of small particles. New particle formation and background sulfate concentrations are critical in this pristine environment, while sea salt particles have a significant impact on SCT in both sets of simulations."

 This study examines the mean annual cycles of monthly cumulated fog-water amounts (CFW) in the central Mediterranean Iberian Peninsula (MIP), highlighting the interplay between meteorological conditions, topography, and geographic location. Seasonal asymmetry in fog-water collection is evident, with summer exhibiting higher fog collection frequency but lower water volumes. In contrast, non-summer seasons feature lower frequency but higher intensity fog events.Tropospheric circulation anomalies at mid- and low-tropospheric levels reveal that fog-water collection is influenced by moisture transport from the Mediterranean, particularly during high fog-collection months. Positive specific humidity anomalies near coastal areas, driven by southeasterly wind anomalies, are crucial for frequent fog formation, while broader, less concentrated anomalies characterize higher-intensity fog events. These findings align with prior research emphasizing the role of cyclonic conditions and maritime moisture advection in enhancing fog-water collection yields.Additionally, seasonal variations in tropospheric circulation anomalies are linked to large-scale teleconnection patterns such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Arctic Oscillation (AO), and Eastern Atlantic-Western Russia (EAWR) patterns. These modulate moisture advection, precipitation anomalies, and low-level winds that drive fog formation and collection. In summer, subtropical high-pressure weakening contributes to increased fog-water cumulates, while winter anomalies highlight the impact of quasi-stationary cyclonic circulations and autumn anomalies, positive NAO/AO phases.These results underscore the climatic importance of fog-water collection for water resource management in drought-prone regions and provide a foundation for future climate monitoring and prediction under anthropogenic radiative forcing. The study's insights have practical implications for enhancing water availability through fog collection in Mediterranean ecosystems."

Spider webs, due to their distinctive chemical composition and adsorption properties, have emerged as promising tools for monitoring environmental pollutant. This study quantified 58 HOCs in insects, spider tissues, and webs of Nephila pilipes across mangroves with varying pollution levels, using quantitative fatty acid signature analysis (QFASA) to estimate spider diets. Significantly elevated concentrations of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), alternative halogenated flame retardants (AHFRs), hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs), and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) were observed in all matrixes from heavily polluted areas, driven by habitat contamination and dietary intake. Concentrations of HCHs, PCBs, PBDEs, and AHFRs in spider webs were highly correlated with those in spider tissues (cephalothorax and abdomen; p < 0.05), whereas DDTs and HBCDs exhibited weak correlations (only in the abdomen; p < 0.05), and TBBPA showed no significant correlation, potentially attributed to compound-specific properties and web characteristics. Integration of HOC concentrations in spider webs with chemical properties (log KOW, log KOA, and molecular weight) yielded significant correlations with biomagnification factors (R2 = 0.415–0.539, p < 0.01) and with tissue HOC levels (R2 = 0.511–0.795, p < 0.001), supporting predictive models for biomagnification and tissue partitioning.

However, DOM reactivity is still enigmatic due to a lack of experimental data with sufficiently high temporal resolution to resolve the intrinsic dynamics within DOM. Likewise, extensive isomeric overlap prevents studying transformation of DOM components with respect to their chemical properties, e.g., molecular polarity. Online ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography with ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-UHRMS) increases the resolution of isomeric DOM composition across a wide range of polarity. We performed a TiO2-aided photo-irradiation experiment with wastewater treatment plant effluent with high temporal sampling resolution (8 time points, 5 h irradiation). Besides new products (<10%) and removed components (25–60%), intermediate products (IntP) were also found, representing 20–60% of components within distinct polarity fractions. The reaction time to reach the peak magnitude maximum was positively related to the H/C ratio of IntP. About 35% of the DOM components showed different reactivities for different polarity fractions. If applied to experiments in the future, our approach offers new perspectives for biogeochemical interpretation and provides important information for drinking water processing or wastewater treatment with respect to potential toxic IntP."

In this work, the most common ligand, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), was used to enhance Mn(II) activation of periodate (PI, IO4–) for the degradation of the sulfisoxazole (SIZ). Chromatographic analysis of EDTA showed that EDTA, like SIZ, also exhibits self-accelerated degradation in this system. This suggests that the accelerated degradation of pollutants may be closely related to the structural changes of Mn(II)-EDTA. Oxidative pretreatment of Mn(II)-EDTA showed that the decay of Mn(II)-EDTA was accompanied by the disappearance of the self-accelerated degradation characteristic of the pollutants. Mass spectrometry analysis suggested that the decarboxymethylation of Mn(II)-EDTA to Mn(II)-ED3A is an important pathway for its structural transformation. The standard ED3A exhibited superior assistance to the Mn(II)/PI system compared to EDTA, without showing the self-accelerated degradation trend. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that Mn(II)-ED3A more readily reacts with PI, and the corresponding oxygen transfer product (O–Mn(IV)-ED3A)− possesses stronger oxidative properties. A series of mechanistic investigations confirmed the formation of transient Mn-oxo species, accompanied by the generation of hydroxyl radicals (•OH) as secondary radicals in the system. The degradation of SIZ primarily involves processes such as hydrolysis, hydroxylation, and nitration, accompanied by the attenuation of toxicity. This study provides mechanistic insights into the evolution of ligands in the Mn(II)/EDTA/PI system and highlights the need for greater attention to structural changes of organic ligands in catalytic oxidation systems."

Yde,Meteorological Impact of Glacier Retreat and Proglacial Lake Temperature in Western Norway,"Glaciers are retreating worldwide, yet, little is known about the influence of these changes on local weather and climate in glacial landscapes. Changes in glacier extent and proglacial lakes alter the thermodynamic forcing in glacier‐lake‐valley systems, and it is still an open question if their importance for future microclimate is greater than direct effects of global warming. To study the impact of these changes, we combine the first set of high‐density spatiotemporal observations of a glacier‐lake‐valley system at Nigardsbreen in western Norway with high‐resolution numerical simulations from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The sensitivity of the thermodynamic circulation to glacier extent and proglacial lakes is tested using glacier outlines from 2006 to 2019 and varying lake surface temperature. The model represents the evolution of glacier winds and cold air pools well when thermal forcing dominates over large‐scale forcing. During a persistent down‐glacier wind regime, the glacier‐valley circulation is sensitive to lake temperature and glacier extent, with strong impacts on wind speed, convection in the valley, and interaction with mountain waves. However, when the large‐scale forcing dominates and the down‐glacier wind is weak and shallower, impacts on atmospheric circulation are smaller, especially those related to lake temperature. This high sensitivity to meteorological conditions is related to whether the wind regime promotes thermal coupling between the glacier and the lake. The findings of this study highlight the need for accurate representation of glacier extent and proglacial lakes when evaluating local effects of past and future climate change in glacial regions."

However, the anthropogenic fingerprint in past and future changes in daily CHEs and the corresponding population exposure remain unclear. Here, using a fingerprint‐based detection and attribution method, we quantify contributions of different external forcings to the historical increase in CHEs by defining three daily scale metrics: the probability ratio (PR) of CHEs and the proportion of CHEs in the number of extreme hot days/nights (PTday/PTnight). All three metrics increased significantly by 117.9%, 128.7%, and 133.4% globally from 1950 to 2014. It is very likely (>90%) for human to leave fingerprints in increasing daily CHEs. The increases in PR, PTday, and PTnight that are attributable to greenhouse gas emissions are 121.2%, 123.1%, and 121.5%, respectively. By the end of the 21st century under a high‐emission scenario, fingerprint‐constrained projections show the PR of CHEs will be about 60 times higher than the climatological period, with around 41% of hot days and 49% of hot nights as CHEs, reducing the magnitude compared to raw projections. In some regions such as mid and high‐latitudes, almost all daytime or nighttime extreme‐heat events would become CHEs. The growing difference between CHE days per person and per unit of land area suggests that CHEs will disproportionately affect densely populated areas. Our results indicate that adaptive measures are required to alleviate the increasing proportion of CHEs and the disproportionate population exposure in densely populated areas."

 The 87Sr/86Sr isotopic ratio has emerged as a valuable geochemical tracer in fields such as environmental forensics, archaeology, and provenance research. However, generating accurate and spatially continuous isoscape maps from sparse isotopic measurements remains a major challenge due to limited data availability and spatial heterogeneity. To address this, we propose a hybrid framework for 87Sr/86Sr isoscape mapping that integrates a kriging-based data augmentation method with a deep learning (DL) classifier. The kriging component generates synthetic training samples by interpolating sparse isotopic data while preserving underlying spatial correlations and geological anisotropy. These augmented data, along with spatial geological features (e.g., lithology, tectonic settings) and geochemical compositions, are used as input variables for training a feedforward deep neural network. The approach was applied to 409 soil samples collected across South Korea, and its performance was benchmarked against conventional kriging and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The proposed model achieved significantly higher classification accuracy (91.67%) compared to kriging-based and CNN-based models (76.7% and 86.7%, respectively).

 Accurate precipitation forecasts are crucial for societal development and safety, particularly during extreme precipitation events. Current Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models have been widely used and play a key role in precipitation forecasts, however, systematic biases persist. Consequently, statistical methods and deep learning models have been proposed for the post-processing of precipitation forecasts, which improve the original forecasts to a certain degree. However, owing to the highly nonlinear and nonstationary nature of precipitation, these methods fail to perform adequately for extreme precipitation. Thus, in this study, we first proposed a novel deep learning model, coupling the Long Short-Term Memory and Nonstationary Transformer (LNT), to capture nonstationary precipitation features. Second, we designed a novel loss function, called the generalized exponential likelihood (GEL) loss function to capture extreme precipitation by balancing clustering and outlier features. Furthermore, we proposed a dual-layer dynamic learning rate adjustment strategy (A) for handling dynamic learning demands to get the global optimal solution and the higher precision of post-processing. The dataset from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) was used as inputs for the models in the experimental post-processing of daily precipitation forecasts. The results show that precipitation post-processed by the LNT_GEL_A outperformed the original ECMWF forecasts and the other models. Particularly, at the lead time of 240 h, when the precipitation was above 50.0 mm/d, LNT_GEL_A could better balance the precipitation intensity and reliability, with a CORR of 0.66, the lowest RMSE (14.95 mm/d), and a probability of detection (POD) of 0.8. Additionally, the LNT_GEL_A model demonstrated superior performance in capturing high precipitation areas during the spatial distribution analysis of typical extreme precipitation events. Overall, the proposed LNT_GEL_A model offers an innovative approach, enhancing the precision of original precipitation forecasts and providing valuable insights for post-processing short- and medium-term daily precipitation forecasts."

The analysis of 140 vertical profiles reveals a reverse trend in LWC, maximum values at ground decreasing with height, during stable conditions in optically thin fogs, evolving towards quasi-adiabatic characteristics when fogs become thick. These results offer new perspectives for better constraining fog numerical simulations. 
 A better understanding of the fog life cycle is required to improve forecasts by numerical weather prediction models and to reduce impacts of fog on human activities. However there are still many unknowns about the physical mechanisms driving fog variability. In particular, a main issue is that the transition from optically thin to thick fog is too sudden in numerical simulations. The liquid water content (LWC) profile is a key parameter, but observations in fog are sorely lacking. Here, we investigate observations from the SOuth west FOGs 3D experiment for processes study (SOFOG3D). In situ measurements collected under a tethered balloon provide 140 vertical profiles, which allow an exhaustive analysis of 8 thin fogs (thickness <50 m) and 4 developed layers. We estimate the thin-to-thick transition period using thresholds for longwave radiation flux, turbulent kinetic energy, vertical temperature gradient, fog top height and liquid water path. In situ data are used to compute the equivalent fog adiabaticity from closure, which is compared with the value derived using a one-column conceptual model of adiabatic fog, assuming that LWC linearly increases with height. We found that the reverse trend of the LWC profile (LWC maximal at the ground and decreasing with height) is ubiquitous in optically thin fogs under stable temperature conditions, while quasi-adiabatic features with increasing LWC values with height are mainly observed in well-mixed optically thick fogs under slightly unstable conditions. This study provides new insights into the evolution of LWC profile during the fog life cycle, to constrain numerical simulations."

Two stations in the port measured pollution levels and captured over 350 ship plumes to study their chemical composition. Results showed that pollution levels, such as ultra-fine particles, were higher in the port than in the city and offer strong support to improve emission inventories. These findings may also serve as reference to assess the benefits of a sulfur Emission Control Area in the Mediterranean in 2025. 
 A summertime field campaign was conducted in Marseille, one of the major cruise and ferry ports in the Mediterranean, to provide comprehensive analysis of in-port ship emissions. High-temporal-resolution data were simultaneously collected from two monitoring stations deployed in the port area to examine the composition in both the gas and the particulate phases. More than 350 individual plumes were captured from a variety of ships and operational phases. Gaseous emissions are predominantly composed of NOx (86 %) and CO (12 %), with SO2 and CH4 each accounting for about 1 %. Although non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) make up less than 0.1 % of the gaseous phase, they can be as high as 10 % under specific operational conditions. Submicron particles (PM1) are mainly composed of organics (75 %), black carbon (21 %), and sulfate (4 %) that is not balanced with ammonium. Among the ship-related characteristics investigated, the operational phase is the most influential, with a 3-fold increase in submicron particle (PM1) emissions, along with higher relative contributions of black carbon (BC) and sulfate and the detection of vanadium, nickel, and iron during manoeuvring/navigation compared to at berth. Pollutant levels in the port are higher than those found at the urban background site, with average concentrations of NOx, PM1, and particle numbers up to twice as high in the port. Analysis of the maximum concentrations reveals that pollutants such as SO2 and trace metals, including vanadium and nickel, are 2 to 10 times higher in the port area. This study provides robust support for enhancing source apportionment and emission inventories, both of which are crucial for assessing air, health, and climate impacts of shipping."

 The surface elevation of the Greenland Ice Sheet is constantly changing due to the interplay between surface mass balance processes and ice dynamics, each exhibiting distinct spatiotemporal patterns. Here, we employ satellite and airborne altimetry data with fine spatial (1 km) and temporal (monthly) resolutions to document this spatiotemporal evolution from January 2003 to August 2023. To estimate elevation changes of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS), we utilize radar altimetry data from CryoSat-2 and EnviSat, laser altimetry data from the ICESat and ICESat-2, and laser altimetry data from NASA's Operation IceBridge Airborne Topographic Mapper. We produce continuous monthly ice surface elevation changes from January 2003 to August 2023 on a 1 km grid covering the entire GIS. We estimate cumulative ice loss of 4352 Gt ± 315 Gt (12.1±0.9 mm sea level equivalent) during this period, excluding peripheral glaciers. Between 2003 and 2023, the ice sheet land-terminating margin underwent a significant cumulative thinning of several meters. Ocean-terminating glaciers exhibited thinning between 20–40 m, with Jakobshavn Isbræ experiencing an exceptional thinning of nearly 70 m. This dataset of fine-resolution altimetry data in both space and time will support studies of ice mass loss and will be useful for GIS modeling. To validate our monthly mass changes of the Greenland ice sheet, we use mass change from satellite gravimetry and mass change from the input–output method.

It was produced using a reconstruction framework that combines thousands of ground observations with landform and elevation data. The dataset provides consistent weather information even in mountainous regions and supports studies on land surface and water processes, climate change, and environmental impacts. 
 Fine-resolution and high-accuracy meteorological datasets are essential for understanding climate change processes and their cascading impacts on hydrology, water resources management, and ecological systems. In this study, we present a nationwide, high-resolution dataset of six daily meteorological variables across China from 1961 to 2021, including average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, and sunshine duration. The dataset was generated through a hierarchical reconstruction framework that utilizes daily observations from 2345 meteorological stations across China, combined with station-level topographic attributes (latitude, longitude, and elevation). By decoding the nonlinear relationships among six meteorological variables and their spatial covariates, the framework enables the generation of gridded daily fields at 1 km resolution with spatial continuity and internal consistency. Validation against 118 in-situ stations confirms that the dataset achieves high accuracy across all variables, with average, maximum, and minimum temperatures exhibiting minimal errors (median RMSEs: 1.03 °C, 1.19 °C, 1.34 °C; median MEs: -0.09 °C, -0.10 °C, -0.08 °C) and high consistency with in-situ data (median CCs: 1.00, 0.99, 0.99). Atmospheric pressure shows minimal error (median RMSE: 2.48 hPa; median ME: -0.02 hPa) and high consistency (median CC: 0.98). Although relative humidity has slightly weaker accuracy (median RMSE: 6.02 %; median ME: -0.5 %; median CC: 0.90), it still surpasses standard benchmarks. Sunshine duration maintains high precision (median RMSE: 1.48 h; median ME: 0.05 h; median CC: 0.93), demonstrating overall excellent product quality. Further comparison reveals that in high-altitude and topographically complex regions, the reconstructed product demonstrates higher actual accuracy than suggested by station-to-grid validation, as spatial mismatches between stations and grid cells lead to systematic underestimation.

It was developed using large-scale wheat sample generation combined with region-specific feature selection strategies. The dataset demonstrates high accuracy (overall accuracy > 0.91) and offers detailed spatial information to support agricultural monitoring and food security efforts in China. 
 Wheat, as one of the main food crops in the world, plays a vital role in shaping agricultural trade patterns. China is the largest producer and consumer of wheat globally, characterized by extensive cultivation areas and diverse planting systems. However, current remote sensing-based wheat mapping studies often rely on uniform phenological feature variables, without adequately accounting for the significant differences in wheat growth cycles across China’s diverse agro-ecological zones. In addition, the lack of large-scale training samples severely limits both the accuracy and the spatial-temporal generalization capacity. Furthermore, existing research in China has primarily focused on the monitoring and mapping of winter wheat, while spring wheat remains largely understudied—particularly in major spring wheat-producing regions in northern China—leading to limited availability of targeted remote sensing products. These limitations hinder the development of high-accuracy, spatially comprehensive wheat mapping datasets and reduce the completeness of agricultural monitoring and food security assessments. To address these issues, this study proposes a cross-regional training sample generation method that integrates time-series remote sensing data with crop distribution products. Furthermore, a province-level, differentiated feature selection strategy is introduced to enhance the regional adaptability and classification performance of the model. Based on these methods, we developed 10 m resolution wheat distribution dataset (CN_Wheat10) covering the years 2018–2024. The dataset includes spring and winter wheat harvested area maps for 15 provinces and detailed winter wheat planted area maps for 10 provinces across China. Validation using a large-scale reference dataset built from field surveys and high-resolution imagery visual interpretation indicates that CN_Wheat10 achieves mapping accuracies above 0.93 for winter wheat and above 0.91 for spring wheat. When compared with wheat area statistics from the China Statistical Yearbook, the coefficient of determination (R2) exceeds 0.94 at the provincial level and remains above 0.88 at the municipal level. Spatially, wheat cultivation in China is characterized by a pattern of concentration in the east, dispersion in the west, a dominance of winter wheat, and a supplementary role of spring wheat. CN_Wheat10 provides spatial distribution information on both spring and winter wheat harvested areas and winter wheat planted regions in key production areas. Compared with existing products that mainly focus on winter wheat, this dataset expands both the spatial coverage and the crop types, offering more comprehensive data support for agricultural monitoring and management in China.

By comparing model outputs with data from a black spruce forest in Alaska, we developed a clearer, more efficient method of matching observations. This is a key step towards understanding how Arctic ecosystems may respond to warming and release carbon, helping make future climate predictions more reliable. 
 The permafrost region contains a significant portion of the world's soil organic carbon, and its thawing, driven by accelerated Arctic warming, could lead to substantial release of greenhouse gases, potentially disrupting the global climate system. Accurate predictions of carbon cycling in permafrost ecosystems hinge on the robust calibration of model parameters. However, manually calibrating numerous parameters in complex process-based models is labor-intensive and is complicated further by equifinality – the presence of multiple parameter sets that can equally fit the observed data. Incorrect calibration can lead to unrealistic ecological predictions. In this study, we employed the Model Analysis and Decision Support (MADS) software package to automate and enhance the accuracy of parameter calibration for carbon dynamics within the coupled Dynamic Vegetation Model, Dynamic Organic Soil Model, and Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (DVM-DOS-TEM), a process-based ecosystem model designed for high-latitude regions. The calibration process involved adjusting rate-limiting parameters to accurately replicate observed carbon and nitrogen fluxes and stocks in both soil and vegetation. Gross primary productivity, net primary productivity, vegetation carbon, vegetation nitrogen, and soil carbon and nitrogen pools served as synthetic observations for a black spruce boreal forest ecosystem. To validate the efficiency of this new calibration method, we utilized model-generated synthetic and actual observations. When matching model outputs to observed data, we encountered difficulties in maintaining mineral soil carbon stocks. Additionally, due to strong interdependencies between parameters and target values, the model consistently overestimated carbon and nitrogen allocation to the stems of evergreen trees. This study demonstrates the calibration workflow, offers an in-depth analysis of the relationships between parameters and observations (synthetic and actual), and evaluates the accuracy of the calibrated parameter values."

 The third version of the Regional Atmosphere and Land (RAL3) science configuration is documented. Developed through international partnerships, RAL configurations define settings for the Unified Model atmosphere and Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) when applied across timescales with kilometre and sub-kilometre-scale model grids. The RAL3 configuration represents a major advance compared to previous versions by delivering a common science definition suitable for application to tropical and mid-latitude regions. Developments within RAL3 include the introduction of a double-moment microphysics scheme and a bimodal cloud scheme, replacing use of a single-moment scheme and different cloud schemes for mid-latitudes and tropics in previous versions. Updates have been implemented to the boundary layer scheme and a consolidation of land model settings to be more consistent with global atmosphere and land (GAL) science configurations. Physics developments aimed to address priorities for model performance improvement identified by users. This paper documents the RAL3 science configuration, including a series of iterative revisions delivered since its first release, and their characteristics. Evidence is provided from the variety of assessments of RAL3, relative to the previous version (RAL2). Collaborative development and evaluation across organizations have enabled evaluation across a range of domains, grid spacing and timescales. The analysis indicates more realistic precipitation distributions, improved representation of clouds and of visibility, a continued trend to more realistic representation of convection, and reduced near-surface wind speeds but a persistent cold-temperature bias. Overall the convective-scale verification scores and climatological model distributions relative to observations improve for the majority of variables. Ensemble results show improvements to the spread–error relationship. User feedback from subjective assessment activities has also been positive. Differences between RAL3 revisions and RAL2 are further illustrated through a process-based analysis of a convective system over the UK. The latest RAL3 configuration (RAL3.3) is therefore recommended for research, operational numerical weather prediction, and climate production at kilometre and sub-kilometre scales."

As a representative class of MNP, polystyrene (PS) has been widely detected in the atmosphere. However, study on its toxicity toward the human respiratory system remains incomplete. Previous works have investigated toxicological mechanisms of PS in human normal lung (BEAS-2B) cells based on a single signaling pathway, which is partial and inadequate. In this work, by analyzing key protein level changes, fluorescence colocalization, and pathway inhibition, PS exposure-induced Ca2+ disorder was found to simultaneously activate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (IRE1α-XBP 1s-Chop and caspase 12) and mitochondrial signaling pathways to promote BEAS-2B cell apoptosis. By exposing these cells to different particle sizes (20, 100, and 1000 nm) and concentrations (100, 250, and 500 μg mL–1) of PS, the rule of different signaling pathways that synergistically induce toxicity in BEAS-2B cells was discerned. Conditional appearance of caspase 12 pathway and sustained coactivation of IRE1α-XBP 1s-Chop and mitochondrial pathways were proved to be related to effective PS deposition and mitochondria-associated ER membrane mediation, respectively. The synergistic signaling pathways causing aberrant BEAS-2B cell apoptosis under environmentally relevant dosages highlight the complexity of PS toxicity in the respiratory system.

In this study, we investigated how the cell wall interface of the freshwater microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii modulated Cu biotransformation. Our findings revealed that membrane-localized and intracellular Cu biotransformation might be closely linked to redox differentiation. Specifically, cell wall deficiency might alter the redox conditions in the cell wall–plasma membrane space, resulting in a significant accumulation of intracellularly labile Cu(I). This surge in labile Cu(I) caused oxidative stress by modifying the redox environment in cell-wall-deficient (CW) cells, leading to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Concurrently, these redox changes might regulate the intracellular Cu biotransformation processes, disrupting the dynamics of the intracellular labile Cu(I)/Cu(II) cycle. In response to the oxidative stress induced by abnormal Cu biotransformation, CW cells activated the GSH system to scavenge excess ROS and stabilize internalized labile Cu(I). However, prolonged disruption of Cu biotransformation led to adverse effects, including mitochondrial fragmentation and impaired photosynthetic performance. To mitigate this cytotoxicity, CW cells deployed additional detoxification strategies, such as the assembly of lysosome-related organelles and the synthesis of polyphosphate, which sequestered excess labile Cu(I) and helped to maintain cellular homeostasis."

However, simultaneously achieving the oil resistance and salt tolerance of evaporators remains challenging. In response, we proposed a self-rotating interfacial solar evaporator (SSE) with a superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic polydopamine/polypyrrole-coated nonwoven fabric (PDA/PPy-NF) layer. Such an SSE can isolate the salt and oil discharging areas, thus achieving continuous demulsification and crystallization by designedly guiding self-cleaning. Based on the torque balance theory, we established a self-cleaning cycle prediction model for an SSE. After optimizing the interface wettability, the SSE presented a high long-term evaporation rate of 1.86 kg m–2 h–1 under 1 sun, with a more than 99% oil and salt removal ratio. Taking Tianjin as an example, it is estimated that an SSE can produce freshwater with a high daily average rate of 5.5–6.5 kg m–2, and 1 m2 of an SSE can meet the daily drinking water supply for at least two adults. In conclusion, an SSE can be regarded as an ideal solution for treating saline oily wastewater, and this work is expected not only  to expand the application scope of solar evaporators but also address the current water–energy challenges, thereby accelerating the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals."

In this study, we enrolled 1019 young men who provided 3,550 urine samples over a 3-month follow-up period. We measured nine OPFR metabolite concentrations in urine samples and assessed depressive symptoms using the Beck Depression Inventory questionnaire. In the fully adjusted linear regression models, a 2.7-fold increase in urinary diphenyl phosphate (DPHP) concentrations was associated with a 0.44 unit (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.06, 0.82) higher depressive symptom scores. When men were categorized as having any depressive symptoms (score: > 10 vs ≤ 10), Poisson regression models showed an increased risk of depression across DPHP tertiles (Ptrend = 0.08). Further, we found stronger associations between urinary OPFR metabolite concentrations and depressive symptom scores among men with a higher waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, or waist-height ratio (Pinteraction < 0.15). The machine learning algorithm identified three different patterns of obesity, and the strongest association between urinary DPHP concentrations and depressive symptom scores was observed among men with a waist-hip ratio of ≥ 0.89 and a body mass index of <24 kg/m2. In summary, exposure to OPFRs may be associated with depressive symptoms among young men, especially in those with abdominal obesity."

Here, the authors show that disrupting Golgi-endosome protein AP1M1 enhances ASO activity by prolonging ASO endosomal residence and increasing the likelihood of endosomal escape. 
 Anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are modified synthetic single-stranded molecules with enhanced stability, activity, and bioavailability. They associate with RNA through sequence complementarity and can reduce or alter mRNA expression upon binding of splice site positions. To target RNA in the nucleus or cytoplasm, ASOs must cross membranes, a poorly understood process. We performed an unbiased CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen with a genetic splice reporter to identify genes that can increase or decrease ASO activity, resulting in the most comprehensive catalog of ASO-activity modifier genes. Here we reveal distinct targets, including AP1M1 and TBC1D23, linking ASO activity to transport of cargo between the Golgi and endosomes. AP1M1 absence strongly increases ASO activity by delaying endosome-to-lysosome transport in vitro and in vivo. Prolonged ASO residence time in the endosomal system may increase the likelihood of ASO escape. This insight into AP1M1 role in ASO trafficking suggests a way for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of ASOs by manipulating the endolysosomal pathways.

Here, the authors investigate its neurotropic potential and show that neuritic transport of viral particles drives neuronal degeneration. 
 In 2022-23, the world witnessed the largest recorded outbreak of monkeypox virus (MPXV). Neurological manifestations were reported alongside the detection of MPXV DNA and MPXV-specific antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients. Here, we analyze the susceptibility of neural tissue to MPXV using human neural organoids (hNOs) exposed to a clade IIb isolate. We report susceptibility of several cell types to the virus, including neural progenitor cells and neurons. The virus efficiently replicates in hNOs, as indicated by the exponential increase of infectious viral titers and establishment of viral factories. Our findings reveal focal enrichment of viral antigen alongside accumulation of cell-associated infectious virus, suggesting viral cell-to-cell spread. Using an mNeonGreen-expressing recombinant MPXV, we confirm cell-associated virus transmission. We furthermore show the formation of beads in infected neurites, a phenomenon associated with neurodegenerative disorders. Bead appearance precedes neurite-initiated cell death, as confirmed through live-cell imaging. Accordingly, hNO-transcriptome analysis reveals alterations in cellular homeostasis and upregulation of neurodegeneration-associated transcripts, despite scarcity of inflammatory and antiviral responses. Notably, tecovirimat treatment of MPXV-infected hNOs significantly reduces infectious virus loads. Our findings suggest that viral disruption of neuritic transport drives neuronal degeneration, potentially contributing to MPXV neuropathology and revealing targets for therapeutic intervention. The mechanisms underlying neurological complications of monkeypox virus infection remain unclear.

 Geologic records support a short-lived carbon release, known as the pre-onset excursion (POE), shortly before the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; ~ 56 Ma). However, the source and pace of the POE carbon release and its relationship to the PETM remain unresolved. Here we show a high-temporal-resolution stratigraphic record spanning the POE and PETM from the eastern Tethys Ocean that documents the evolution of surface ocean carbon cycle, redox and eutrophication, confirming the global nature of the POE. Biomarkers extracted from the sedimentary record indicate a smaller environmental perturbation during the POE than that during the PETM in the eastern Tethys Ocean. Earth system modeling constrained by observed δ13C and pH data indicates that the POE was driven by a largely thermogenic CO2 source, likely associated with sill intrusions prior to the main eruption phase of the North Atlantic Igneous Province and possibly biogeochemical feedbacks involving the release of biogenic methane.

Kazakhstan is a middle-income country with a highly centralized government, dependent on extractive industries for 21.3% of its GDP. Kazakhstan has positioned itself as a ‘strong state’ that promotes sustainable development in its pursuit of international investment. Utilizing a centralized approach to energy policy, Kazakhstan is seeking to become a center for the manufacturing of renewable energy equipment and a key player in the global energy transition. Yet, this seems to be at odds with their goals of creating a sustainable environmental future in local communities. To better understand the energy transition policies pursued, this article examines the energy sector through a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis. Drawing on expert stakeholder interviews, this study examines the SWOT to Kazakhstan’s energy transition from the perspective of stakeholder groups. Based on the findings from the interviews, this article suggests policies that Kazakhstan can adopt from other emerging economies to balance socio-economic needs with sustainability goals to achieve its 2060 carbon neutrality target. The findings provide practical insights for policymakers, local government officials, and development practitioners seeking to align national energy goals with the needs of local stakeholders. Additionally, the study contributes to academic debates on decentralized governance and energy transition by providing a nuanced, stakeholder-informed assessment relevant to researchers in environmental policy and sustainability studies."

This study examines exposure, vulnerability, and resilience across three consecutive extreme events in the Portland metro area: the September 2020 wildfire-related air pollution, the February 2021 snowstorm, and the June 2021 heatwave. We used geographically weighted regression and Spearman rank correlation analysis to investigate relationships between hazard impacts, the social vulnerability index (SoVI), Baseline Resilience Indicators for Communities (BRIC), and proximity to community-based organizations (CBOs) in 416 census tracts. Our analysis reveals strong spatial correlations between wildfire-related air pollution, winter storm impacts, and extreme heat exposure. Communities already burdened by poor air quality, freezing precipitation, and urban heat island effects faced heightened cumulative risk. While this varied by neighborhood, racial minorities, migrant workers, non-US citizens, and low-income households were significantly affected. In contrast, affluent communities with lower SoVI scores and higher BRIC values exhibited greater resilience and were less exposed to these hazards. Although CBOs were concentrated in areas with high SoVI, they were insufficient in mitigating disaster impacts.

It influences climate and weather such as surface air temperatures downstream over Eurasia through establishing a large-scale teleconnection, but past studies on the NAO’s downstream teleconnection have been largely limited to observational data, and further evidence of downstream impacts and associated mechanisms from comprehensive climate modeling is desirable. This study quantifies and analyzes this teleconnection on an interannual timescale by using both ERA5 reanalysis, and five large ensembles from four climate simulation models. A particular focus is placed on dynamical pathways, as well as variability among ensemble members that modulates the teleconnection strength. Results suggest that NAO signals are propagated downstream by Rossby waves, efficiently transmitted through waveguides along both the polar and subtropical jet streams to Eastern Eurasia; while heat can be advected weakly from upstream, advection plays a rather local effect inducing temperature anomalies from the Pacific Ocean onshore. Multiple linear regression shows that internal climate variability significantly modulates the teleconnection: a more locally dominant NAO pattern, and narrower waveguides could strengthen the teleconnection. These two factors combine to explain up to 70% of variance in the teleconnection strength, with each contributing almost equally. Reanalysis data marginally agree with the regression model (1.9 standardized residuals higher in strength), suggesting potential model biases in jets and the NAO variability. Monitoring these modulating factors would be crucial to understanding downstream climate predictability and improving climate prediction models linked to the NAO."

This study examines the impacts of recent climate change and variability on run-of-river (RoR) hydropower production and electricity systems planning. We present an end-to-end pipeline to convert runoff and hydropower specifications into hydropower generation and subsequently integrate it into an electricity systems model. Applying this methodology to Switzerland, we provide a re-analysis of hydropower generation for each RoR power plant with capacities of 300 KW or more for the period 1991–2022. When aggregated on a national scale, our estimations match well nationally reported production and displays a climate-driven year-to-year variability. Our results show an overall tendency towards decreased RoR production in the past decades in Switzerland due to climate change (decrease in water availability). This trend was compensated at a national level with an infrastructure expansion. Based on the derived hydropower time series, we simulate the electricity system under scenarios with either no or a high renewable energy target and showcase contrasting sensitivities of electricity prices to climate variability."

Approximately 88% of Norway’s power comes from hydropower, produced by over 1770 plants. We assess how 285 potential new or revised environmental constraints affect hydropower production and flexibility in the Northern European power system. To do so, we combine a method for estimating environmental flow releases in bypass reaches and stochastic power system optimization. Our results show that reductions in hydropower output due to these constraints are consistent across power system scenarios and two power system models. The reductions amount to 3 TWh yr−1 (2% of Norway’s production), by our estimates. These reductions are primarily driven by flow diversions to bypass river sections. Further, we find that high power prices increase and low prices decrease, reflecting reduced system flexibility. Price increases typically occur in dry spring periods and are linked to activation of season-dependent reservoir restrictions in that period, while price decreases result from higher reservoir volumes entering periods of rain-heavy summer or autumn periods, indirectly linked to restrictions active earlier in the year. In our simulations, we observe that flexibility losses due to environmental constraints to some degree are offset by increased flexible operation of unaffected reservoirs and transmission interconnectors. Finally, our findings suggest that reservoir restrictions may cause spilling, as higher water levels in regulated reservoirs increase the risk of spilling during wet summer or autumn periods. This system-level understanding is crucial for regulatory authorities designing new environmental requirements and revising the terms of hydropower licenses. Our study contributes to informed discussions for balancing hydropower production with local environmental benefits and offers a framework for studying similar constraints in other regions, such as Sweden, North America and European Alpine countries."

However, the magnitude of this potential natural climate solution (NCS) remains uncertain across ecoregions. Few studies have evaluated riparian planting C sequestration and storage, particularly in highly productive wet riparian ecosystems. In recent decades, riparian reforestation has accelerated in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) of the United States, primarily aiming to restore ecosystem functions and associated benefits. Using these plantings as a ‘natural experiment’, we assessed C storage in woody vegetation (trees and shrubs) and soils across a chronosequence of PNW riparian reforestation sites. Our study evaluated changes in C storage with planting age and identified key covariates affecting C storage in plants and soils and their relationship with planting age across a ∼430 km latitudinal gradient in western Oregon, USA. We found that woody and soil C stocks increase with planting age, averaging 24% and 1% per year, respectively. Increases in tree C were strongly driven by increasing planting age and tree stem density. Understory C was weakly related to stand characteristics and geomorphic properties, and strongly related to planting age. Soil C gains were positively driven by precipitation. We find that riparian reforestation can result in increased C storage, with woody vegetation comprising most of the increase. Our results highlight the importance of including both trees and shrubs in plantings to realize C accumulation gains in the earlier years. Because C accumulation is gradual, yet compounding (i.e. 10+ and 15+ years for total C stocks to increase by 1.95, and 19.2 Mg C ha−1, respectively), riparian reforestation projects implemented today could take over a decade to deliver high NCS benefits, emphasizing the urgency to implement these projects to limit the worst of climate change impacts."

Yet the space time pattern of such events on a global scale and their relationships with temperature and wind speed are not well understood. Based on over 9000 global meteorological stations and multi-source weighted-ensemble precipitation covering the warm seasons of 1980–2022, the characteristics and trends in sub-daily extreme precipitation (3 h time interval) were examined and their relationships with temperature and wind speed were explored across global major river basins. The results revealed a similar spatial pattern in the annual frequency, intensity, duration, and total amount of 3 h extreme precipitation events, though notable discrepancies were observed in specific regions such as Southeast Asia and eastern North America. Over half of the stations, particularly in South America, exhibited decreasing trends in extreme precipitation frequency, while significant increases were documented in Europe and Southeast Asia. The relationship between extreme precipitation intensity and temperature over different river basins exhibited diverse behaviors, characterized by monotonic increase (sub-daily Clausius–Clapeyron scaling, mostly in Europe), hook structure (mostly in North America), monotonic decrease (mostly in Africa), and nearly constant (mostly in Mid East, South Africa and South America). Moreover, wind speed generally increased with extreme precipitation intensity for tropical and subtropical basins, while in high-latitude basins strong winds tended to occur with lower precipitation intensity. These insights are vital for improving resilience against sub-daily extreme precipitation."

Seasonal TC frequency increased significantly when either AEW periodicity was suppressed, with a larger increase when the 2–6 d waves were suppressed. We also found that suppressing the 2–6 d waves increased mid-tropospheric moisture by up to 8%, as well as overall atmospheric instability, near the western coast of northern Africa.

This study evaluates the impact of land use and housing policies on building whole life carbon (WLC) emissions, introducing a novel approach that incorporates carbon stock losses from urban land expansion. Using geospatial data and standardized life cycle assessment methodologies, it analyzes residential buildings in Helsinki from 2001 to 2020. These are grouped into four regional housing portfolios (HPs), with 1040 observations, based on construction period and socioeconomic attributes. Findings show a 42% reduction in WLC emissions (from 24 to 14 kgCO2e m−2 a−1 in Vuosaari) during the study period. These reductions are primarily driven by energy system decarbonization and supported by improved building energy performance in new builds. However, embodied carbon remains a hidden challenge, though some progress is seen in one HP where a rise in biogenic construction led to 13% lower embodied emissions and a substantial increase in carbon storage (from 0.1 to 1.3 kgCO2e m−2 a−1). Densification efforts have mitigated carbon losses from land use change, yet they remain meaningful (4%–8% of new build emissions). While lower-density areas show greater carbon losses, the overall variation in emissions between densities in relatively small due to factors pertaining to other life cycle stages. Municipalities and developers must account for these carbon losses from new urban development to better reflect urban sustainability. Additionally, the study presents that carbon emissions per floor area offers only a partial view of building sustainability, as the functional unit moderately correlates with emissions per capita. Hence, a wider array of functional units are required in assessing building emissions. Future research could elaborate on such policies by proposing concrete operational plans."

Here, we assess how different fire frequencies and intensities influence tree mortality and carbon dynamics in southeastern Amazonia. Using a replicated randomized block design with 24 plots (40 × 40 m), we applied four treatments: unburned control, one burn in 2016 (B1), two burns in 2013 and 2016 (B2), and two burns with added fuel (B2+) to increase fire intensity. Forest inventories conducted from 2012 to 2024 measured tree mortality, diversity, composition, and aboveground biomass. Fire frequency and intensity significantly increased mortality, particularly among small trees, but impacts on forest structure and productivity were more nuanced. Aboveground biomass declined modestly in burned plots, with the greatest loss in B2+ (13%). Aboveground net primary productivity dropped immediately post-burn, especially in B2 and B2+, and partially recovered by 2022–2024. In contrast, leaf area index and litterfall rebounded within a couple of years, suggesting a degree of structural and functional resilience. Species richness and composition remained relatively stable in the years following the first experimental fires, but gradually declined and shifted in B2 and B2+ plots beginning in 2014. These results indicate that the experimental forests’ resilience to low-intensity and infrequent fires can prevent widespread forest collapse, but repeated and intensified burns likely undermine long-term resilience by altering forest structure, composition, and carbon dynamics. With the southeastern Amazon forests projected to burn more often in the coming decades, our results highlight both the vulnerability and recovery potential of these ecosystems. Maintaining ecological integrity and minimizing additional disturbances that influence fuel availability will be critical for sustaining forest functions under future fire regimes."

We harmonized environmental input–output analysis with data derived from the national representative consumer-expenditure survey and LTC insurance statistics obtained from domestic economic and medical datasets to detail the CF of Japanese households requiring LTC. In Japan, the CF per capita associated with care was boosted as the care level increased. Notably, there is a disparity of up to 14 times between the care level with the lowest CF emissions and that with the highest CF emissions. Furthermore, households with LTC insurance demonstrate higher per-capita CF than those without such insurance, even when other household consumption needs are considered. This trend may mitigate the reduction in total CF related to household consumption, despite a national population decline, due to the anticipated rise in demand for LTC driven by an aging population by the year 2050 which is the target year for achieving carbon neutrality in Japan.

 As the health impacts of ultrafine particles become better understood, accurately modelling size distribution and number concentration in chemistry-transport models is becoming increasingly important. The number concentration is strongly affected by processes linked to aerosol dynamics: coagulation, condensation, gas- and particle-phase partitioning, and nucleation. Coagulation is usually solved using an Eulerian approach, relying on a fixed discretization of particle sizes. In contrast, condensation and evaporation processes are rather solved using a Lagrangian approach, requiring redistribution of particles on the fixed-size mesh. Here, a new analytic formulation is presented to compute efficiently coagulation partition coefficients, allowing us to dynamically adjust the discretization of the coagulation operator to the size mesh evolution  and  therefore solve all the processes linked to aerosol dynamics with a dynamics mesh approach, avoiding the redistribution on the fixed-size grid.

The ubiquitous distribution of 21 siloxanes in PV production additives/accessories [<LOD-626 μg/g, detection frequency (df) = 6.7–100%, n = 45] indicated their potential environmental emission, which was confirmed by wide detection (<LOD-14.6 mg/L, df = 30–100%, n = 10) of siloxanes and their hydrolysis product [Me2Si(OH)2] in wastewaters from ten PV production facilities. Overall, annual siloxanes usage (59–463 thousand tonnes) during PV production accounted for 3.9–30% of their total consumption in China. Annual mass loads (389 tonnes) in PV production wastewater were 1.7 times those (from personal care products) in national domestic wastewater. In MeHg-containing (4.35–185 ng/L) wastewaters of PV production, concentrations of ∑siloxanes were positively correlated (R2 = 0.44, p < 0.05) with MeHg/THg ratios, suggesting potential contribution of Si–CH3 bonds to mercury methylation. Laboratory experiments in simulated PV wastewater indicated that compared with dimethylsiloxanes, other methylsiloxanes and methylsilanol containing electrophilic groups (phenyl, vinyl, and hydroxyl) would lead to 1.3–7.1 times larger abiotic mercury methylation fractions (0.14–4.0% after 18 h incubation) by accelerating the cleavage of Si–CH3.

However, their risks to plants are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effects of Li-ion battery cathode materials, LiFePO4 (LFP) and LiMnFePO4 (LMFP) particles, on soybean growth. We found that LFP exhibited a stronger inhibitory effect on plants than LMFP at the same exposure concentration. Molecular-level toxicological assessment shows that LFP and LMFP can damage cellular structures, trigger plant stress responses, alter metabolic processes, and reduce antioxidant levels, ultimately resulting in phytotoxicity. Mn doping in LMFP increases particle surface polarity, enhancing soil immobilization and reducing plant uptake. Molecular dynamics show LFP causes greater cellular membrane damage than LMFP, exacerbating plant stress. Notably, LFP inhibits antioxidant metabolism pathways, reducing plants’ ability to cope with abiotic stresses. Finally, risk quotient (RQ) reveals that the environmental risks of Li-ion battery cathode materials are significant and warrant attention.

Results show this IoT-DSL regime extends average shelf life by 8.1–13.8% in fruits, dairy, and vegetables, although gains fall two- to 5-fold for animal and aquatic products at lower quality thresholds, while nontechnical interventions deliver only 3.2–6.5% waste reductions.

Strong La Niña induces negative SPMM more effectively than El Niño induces positive SPMM, due to differences in ENSO teleconnections and their intensity. During boreal summer and fall of strong La Niña, intense transient eddy feedback reshapes the Pacific‐South America pattern into a South Pacific Oscillation‐like pressure dipole, strengthening trade winds and promoting negative SPMM growth, a process absent in El Niño. In boreal winter, stronger La Niña teleconnections sustain negative SPMM into spring. Half of the negative SPMM events co‐occur with negative North Pacific Meridional Mode, contributing to multi‐year La Niña development.

The dielectric contrast between frozen and thawed soil induces diurnal amplitude variation (DAV) in brightness temperature at L‐band, providing a basis for tracking land‐atmosphere interactions. Our study shows that DAV effectively captures cold air masses' origin and seasonal movement. During a cold wave, its phase relationship with air and soil temperatures falls into four categories: precedes (−1.1 to −0.6 days), lags (0.71–0.98 days), in between (−0.62 to 0.34 days), and synchronized. Moreover, DAV lags air temperature in 63% of cases and precedes soil temperature in 59%, consistently fluctuating within their overlap region.

We found that a palm swamp peatland in the Peruvian Amazon that was a strong annual sink for 2 years switched to carbon neutral in the absence of a major anthropogenic disturbance.

These mechanisms were not, however, synchronous in time. The importance of photoinhibition as a driver of changes in peatland carbon budgets is a novel finding, and an understudied mechanism of canopy photosynthetic impairment.

This region is considered an end‐member type subduction zone, where the old Pacific Plate subducts steeply with pronounced slab curvature. The study revealed low Vp and Vs values and high Vp/Vs ratios of ∼1.95 in the uppermost mantle, indicating a high degree of hydration. These ratios are higher than those found in young oceanic plates (1.81–1.83) and much greater than those for dry peridotite (1.73–1.75). The results emphasize the importance of recording both P‐ and S‐waves in trench settings to assess serpentinization, as outer‐rise faults in both old and young oceanic plate can channel fluids into subduction zones potentially in different ways."

 The retreat of Antarctic ice shelves due to calving and the subsequent reduction in buttressing of the Antarctic Ice Sheet are of major concern for future sea-level rise. Sudden, widespread calving of weakened ice shelves has been linked to fracture amplification forced by ocean swell following regional sea-ice losses, but increases in the magnitudes and durations of swell-induced ice-shelf flexure in the lead-ups to calving events have not been tracked. Here we present 7-year datasets of sea-ice-barrier lengths and shelf-front flexural stress that encompass large-scale calving events for the Wilkins and Voyeykov ice shelves. We find that the ice shelves exhibit similar preconditioning patterns, characterized by prolonged amplifications in flexure and the collapse of adjoining fast-ice barriers. We propose a conceptual model for the swell–sea-ice–shelf-front conditions that lead to calving events, show that it fits other major calving events and discuss the likely importance of sea-ice loss for the future of ice shelves.

 Soil conservation practices such as no-till and straw mulching have been practised worldwide, but they frequently show low potential to increase organic carbon and crop grain production, especially in rice paddy systems. Here a ditch-buried straw return technique is proposed to co-enhance soil carbon and crop yield in paddy systems through injection of straw into the subsoil. This technique can protect most of the surface soil and disturb only 10% of the whole field through deep tillage. A 15-year ditch-buried straw return experiment in rice–wheat cropping has shown that compared to the dominant rotary-tillage straw return management, grain yield was increased under ditch-buried straw return by 15% without any additional fertilization inputs. Ditch-buried straw return also increased soil organic carbon stocks at 0–40 cm depth by 46% (17.2 Mg ha−1) mainly through the enhanced conversion of straw-derived carbon into mineral-associated fungal necromass. Overall, ditch-buried straw return decreased net CO2 equivalent emissions by 34% and increased net economic benefits by 18%. Joint enhancements of soil organic carbon and crop yield under ditch-buried straw return were further validated using meta-analysis around China. We conclude that ditch-buried straw return may work as an effective approach for subsoil management.

Here, the authors present a fabrication method to create patchy active particles of arbitrary shape by microstenciling. 
 Active particles, which locally dissipate energy from their environment to function, are useful across disciplines given their dynamic and programmable behaviors. Altering particle shape or surface asymmetry has led to advancements in controlled locomotion or collective behavior for diverse applications such as microrobotics or biomedicine. However, making arbitrary active particles of precise shape and surface composition remains a significant challenge due to limitations in conventional fabrication methods. This paper introduces a fabrication technique that combines two-photon lithography with sacrificial stencil masking to deposit arbitrary metallic patches onto particles of any shape with a limit of resolution as low as 0.2 µm. Using this method, we demonstrate three varieties of active particles displaying nonconventional dynamics: electrokinetic active spheres with tunable three-dimensional motions, catalytic microdiscs with chiral axial spinning, and steric magnetic particles forming self-limiting microrobots. Overall, this high-resolution microstenciling technique offers a versatile strategy to create well-defined active particles and microrobots for numerous practical uses. Active particles are useful for microscale functions, but they lack the necessary complexity to be suitable for wide application.

 Iatrogenic nerve injury is a surgical complication with significant morbidity. This clinical trial, now complete, investigates the systemic administration of bevonescein, which selectively binds to nerves, in a single-arm, prospective multi-center, dose-escalation Phase 1 trial in adult patients with head and neck neoplasms undergoing parotidectomy or thyroidectomy in the United States. Twenty-seven participants are enrolled in the trial and receive the systemic agent. The primary outcome is safety with no dose-limiting toxicity among the 27 patients, but a single adverse event was identified that was possibly related to the study drug (vomiting). Secondary outcomes include the pharmacokinetics, optimal dose, and timing of bevonescein. The half-life of bevonescein is 29–72 min, and the optimal dose is 500 mg by objective measures, with the fluorescence signal-to-background ratio (SBR; 2.1 ± 0.8) significantly higher compared to white light (1.3 ± 0.2; p = 0.003). The fluorescent SBR of nerves between the early (1–3 h) versus late (3–5 h) timing cohorts is not statistically different.

Here, the authors identify a tooth-specific mechanism of bone formation in which the Hedgehog–Foxf pathway regulates the alveolar bone osteoblast fates of DF progenitor cells. 
 The alveolar bone is a specialized mineralized structure supporting the lifelong functionality of the tooth in mastication. The alveolar bone develops from the dental follicle (DF) during tooth root formation due to deliberate epithelial–mesenchymal interactions. However, how DF progenitor cell fates are regulated toward alveolar bone osteoblasts remains unknown. We find that Hedgehog signaling activities are transiently activated during the onset of tooth root formation and alveolar bone formation. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP)-expressing DF cells are highly responsive to Hedgehog signaling, yet constitutive Hedgehog activation using Pthrp-creER and Ptch1-floxed alleles potently suppresses alveolar osteoblast and ligament differentiation of PTHrP+ DF cells, resulting in striking susceptibility to alveolar bone loss. Concomitant inactivation of Hedgehog-target Foxf1 factor in Hedgehog-activated PTHrP+ DF cells partially rescued alveolar bone defects. Therefore, the Hedgehog–Foxf pathway needs to be suppressed to drive alveolar bone osteoblast fates of PTHrP+ DF cells, unraveling a unique tooth-specific mechanism of bone formation requiring deliberate on-off regulations of Hedgehog signaling. The alveolar bone supports the tooth’s lifelong functionality. Here, the authors identify a tooth-specific mechanism of bone formation in which the Hedgehog–Foxf pathway regulates the alveolar bone osteoblast fates of DF progenitor cells."

 Multi-dimensional mechanoreceptors are crucial for both humans and robots, providing omnidirectional force/torque senses to ensure dexterous and precise manipulations. Current six-axis force/torque sensors are bulky, heavy, and rigid with complicated sensing structures and high-cost manufacture. Although flexible force sensors have emerged recently, their perceptive dimension and performance are limited and still unsatisfactory for practical applications. Here, we propose an ultralight (0.30 g), tiny (fingertip size), and flexible six-axis force/torque sensor with a simple structure and low-cost fabrication. The sensor accurately perceives six-dimensional force/torque via capturing the spatial strain field of an elastic piezo-thermic material utilizing web-like scattered thin-film thermoreceptors. Integrating the sensor on the fingertip of humans or robots, we or robots can dexterously manipulate objects (e.g., open bottle cap), play games, and accomplish human-robot collaborative operations via easy fingertip-touch, demonstrating a broad prospect in applications of helping disabled and elderly people, intelligent robots, and virtual reality.

 Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change. Yet, little is known about the relationship between exposure to extreme events, subjective attribution of these events to climate change, and climate policy support, especially in the Global South. Combining large-scale natural and social science data from 68 countries (N = 71,922), we develop a measure of exposed population to extreme weather events and investigate whether exposure to extreme weather and subjective attribution of extreme weather to climate change predict climate policy support. We find that most people support climate policies and link extreme weather events to climate change. Subjective attribution of extreme weather was positively associated with policy support for five widely discussed climate policies. However, exposure to most types of extreme weather event did not predict policy support. Overall, these results suggest that subjective attribution could facilitate climate policy support. Literature produced inconsistent findings regarding the links between extreme weather events and climate policy support across regions, populations and events. This global study offers a holistic assessment of these relationships and highlights the role of subjective attribution."

 Tropical convection anomaly could serve as a crucial driver of global atmospheric teleconnections and weather extremes around the world. However, quantifying the dominances of convection anomalies with regional discrepancies, relevant for the variations of global atmospheric circulations, remains challenging. By using a network analysis of observation-based rainfall and ERA5 reanalysis datasets, our study reveals that El Niño-like convection is the most primary rainfall pattern driving the global atmospheric circulation variations. High local concurrences of above-normal rainfall events over equatorial central-eastern Pacific amplify their impacts, even though the most intense rainfall anomalies are observed near the Maritime Continent. Furthermore, we find that the impacts of El Niño-like convection will be tripled by the end of this century, as projected consistently by 23 climate models. Such “rich nodes get richer” phenomenon is probably attributable to the dipolar rainfall changes over the equatorial western-central Pacific. This study highlights the dominant role of El Niño-like convection on the global climate variations, especially under the future changing climate."

Here, we develop an integrated analytical framework combining a detailed sectoral emission inventory, index decomposition analysis, and a clustering algorithm to investigate China’s synergetic patterns of air pollutant and CO2 emissions across 15 socioeconomic sectors from 2000 to 2020 and uncover the co-drivers behind these trends, with detailed temporal, sectoral, and spatial dynamics revealed. Our analysis suggests that historical policies have effectively curbed air pollutant emissions, while abating CO2 emissions remains a challenge. Energy and climate policies, particularly those focused on structural adjustments, are increasingly instrumental in driving pollution-carbon co-reduction. Compared to the earlier period, the fractional contribution of energy and climate policies to emission reductions of SO2, NOx, PM2.5, and CO2 increased by 1.3-8.6 times during 2010-2020, respectively. Substantial regional heterogeneity in emission co-drivers underscores the need for tailored strategies, such as adopting advanced energy-saving technologies in areas dominated by energy-intensive industries and accelerating the clean energy transition in regions endowed with renewable resources.

 The management of coastal blue carbon ecosystems can contribute to mitigate anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. However, limited information on soil organic carbon (OC) decay rates in tidal marsh, mangrove, and seagrass soils hinders their inclusion in climate strategies and carbon-crediting schemes. Here, we analyzed downcore OC trends in 3761 soil cores from blue carbon ecosystems worldwide. A decrease in OC content with soil depth was measured in 63% of the cores, whereas stable and increasing trends were observed in 22% and 15% of the cores, respectively. Based on 85 profiles where OC decay could be modelled, the OC decay rate in blue carbon ecosystems was 0.023 ± 0.002 yr−1 over the last 100 years and 0.007 ± 0.0007 yr−1 over the last 1000 years.

 The position of continents and oceans in geological time dictates the biogeographic dispersal of life, influences the preservation of mineral resources, and informs our understanding of Earth’s climate trajectory. Reconstructing past crustal locations requires a plate tectonic model that differs depending on whether the model uses a mantle reference frame, or a paleomagnetic reference frame, which considers the rotation between the plate-mantle system and the planetary core (true polar wander). However, reconstructions with mantle or paleomagnetic reference frames have been used interchangeably without quantifying their impact on paleoclimate simulations. Here, we conduct a sensitivity experiment to assess the impact of using a mantle versus a pure paleomagnetic absolute reference frame in simulating global paleoclimate. We show that throughout the Mesozoic and Cenozoic, reference frame choice leads to regional surface temperature differences of over 20 °C and 15 °C respectively. An analysis of Jurassic glendonite and Eocene crocodilian distribution suggest favourable conditions that are more consistent with a paleomagnetic reference frame. These results emphasize the importance of selecting an appropriate tectonic reference frame in deep-time climate research. We advocate for adopting a pure paleomagnetic reference frame, which provides a more reliable record of paleo-latitudes by capturing motions from true polar wander.

 Tungsten deposits are typically associated with crust-derived evolved granitoids. Whether the mantle has contributed to tungsten mineralization, however, is unknown. Here, we provide new and compiled helium‒argon‒mercury‒strontium‒neodymium isotope data in South China and tungsten provinces elsewhere to evaluate this contribution. Our analysis shows that oceanic-subduction-related extension is more likely to facilitate intense tungsten mineralization than other geodynamic processes, e.g., continental collision, post-collisional extension, and intracontinental rifting. During this process, the mantle provides heat for inducing slab devolatilization, whereby abundant helium‒argon‒mercury‒(fluorine) are mobilized into the crust. The 1.8‒1.2 Ga neodymium model ages of the source rocks coincide with the Nuna supercontinent cycle, together with deep-time zircon data, suggesting that the considerable tungsten enrichment of the crust over geological time resulted from mantle-plume-related activities. The above hypothesis is confirmed by the proportion of tungsten-rich basement rocks in major tungsten provinces, highlighting the essential role of the mantle in tungsten recycling and mineralization.

 The seasonal variation of precipitation isotopes (δ18Op) exhibits a north-south dipole in the East Asian monsoon region, correlating with temperature in northern China and precipitation in southern China. However, on longer timescales, δ18Op tends to exhibit spatial coherence. This inconsistency in δ18Op variability across different timescales has sparked considerable debate regarding their climatic interpretation. Here we develop a unified framework to quantify the mechanisms driving δ18Op variability across timescales using water tagging experiments in iCAM5.3 numerical model. Our results demonstrate that δ18Op variations are governed primarily by monsoon-driven changes in moisture source and enroute depletion, rather than local meteorological factors. Furthermore, the relative importance of these processes differs across timescales. Therefore, the evolution of the East Asian summer monsoon, as recorded in δ18Op, should be interpreted through the lens of these two sub-processes of the monsoon system, rather than based solely on the empirical isotopic effects observed on seasonal timescales.

 The United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda), encompassing 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), serves as a framework for global development. However, hurdles such as lack of data, insufficient research methods, and uneven development have hindered progress in implementing the 2030 Agenda. Earth observation (EO) provides objective, space-based data supporting SDG assessments and policymaking for the environmental, socioeconomic development, and human activity. The successful launch of Sustainable Development Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1) in November 2021 marked the beginning of the first science satellite program dedicated to supporting the 2030 Agenda. This paper provides an overview of the SDGSAT-1 mission and its three sensors: Thermal Infrared Spectrometer (TIS), Glimmer Imager (GLI), and Multispectral Imager (MSI), and details the sensors' capabilities in supporting SDG-related research and the future outlook of the Sustainable Development Satellite Constellation. To monitor, evaluate, and study SDGs, SDGSAT-1 collaboratively uses its three sensors to precisely depict traces of human activity day and night, supporting global achievement of the SDGs and research on human-nature interactions. Fostered by the SDGSAT-1 Open Science Program, launched in September 2022, data from SDGSAT-1 is freely available to scientific communities worldwide, accelerating EO-supported SDG applications. Researchers and technologists from over 105 countries, UN agencies, and international organizations have used data from over 450,000 images collected by the TIS, GLI, and MSI sensors. This has resulted in more than 137 scientific papers in SCI-indexed journals covering SDGs 1, 2, 6, 7, 11, and 13–15; 17 scientific reports on UN websites; and numerous public data products. The satellite's imagery has been instrumental in urban development, disaster response, environmental monitoring, agricultural efficiency, and marine conservation. By providing high-resolution imagery, SDGSAT-1 has improved the assessment of urban lighting patterns, industrial activity, and environmental changes, aiding policy-making and sustainable development initiatives. The successful practices of SDGSAT-1 demonstrate that space technologies, particularly EO, can significantly contribute to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.

 The availability of long-term, annually harmonized nighttime light (NTL) data is pivotal for monitoring human activities across past decades. The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) has provided over 20 years of NTL observations, facilitating extensive global and regional studies. With the termination of DMSP NTL in 2013 and the subsequent introduction of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) NTL data, we previously developed the global harmonized NTL dataset (H-NTL-v1), which offers a temporally extended and consistent time series data from 1992 to 2022. Despite its widespread use, the H-NTL-v1 dataset has been affected by noise from auroras and transient lights, particularly in high-latitude areas. In this study, we present an innovative method that employs temporal frequency analysis and Pareto surface optimization to address these challenges, resulting in an improved global harmonized NTL dataset (H-NTL-v2). This enhanced dataset markedly improves the consistency between historical DMSP (1992–2013) and the DMSP-like estimates post-2014. For aurora affected city lights, here we did not implement a specific correction algorithm. Our results indicate that the improved H-NTL-v2, spanning 1992 to 2022, significantly reduces auroral noise and inter-annual variability. Compared to the original H-NTL-v1, the improved H-NTL-v2 demonstrates strong agreement with DMSP observation in 2012 and 2013.

The hourly TM-1 surface soil moisture (SSM) products, offer affluent information for global soil moisture monitoring. This study provides the first comprehensive characterization and performance evaluation of TM-1 SSM products based on in-situ measurements and products of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI), and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS). The TM-1 SSM demonstrates expected spatiotemporal patterns at both regional and global scales. The in-situ validation results reveal its landcover-dependent accuracy, with superior performance over bare soils (unbiased Root Mean Square Error, ubRMSE of about 0.02 m3/m3) compared to vegetated regions (ubRMSE of around 0.07 m3/m3). Furthermore, Extended Triple Collocation (ETC) assessments using (1) TM-1, active, and ground observations and (2) TM-1, model, and ground observations triplets are conducted. The ETC-derived results present that TM-1 SSM achieve global correlation coefficient of 0.75 and random error standard deviation of 0.035 m3/m3.

 Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a fundamental variable for determining mass (water, carbon) and energy surface fluxes. LST can be obtained from remote sensing but under varying configuration geometries that create directional effects due to the inherent anisotropy properties of most terrestrial targets. Actually, thermal infrared (TIR) measurements obtained from satellites or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are seriously impacted by varying viewing and solar geometries (Cao et al., 2019). In this regard, a computationally efficient approach to handle them is using kernel-driven models (KDM), as they were shown to be an effective solution. However, in high-resolution scenes, the structural features can be very detailed and, in this case, the assumption of homogeneity in considering traditional KDM no longer holds. This is why we propose to develop a novel KDM that is able to handle typical heterogeneous scenes whose structure is dominated by rows. Rather than improving existing point-spread kernels, we propose a line-spread kernel considering the row orientation and radiative occlusion. This new KDM is validated with both airborne measurements and simulated datasets generated by three-dimensional radiative transfer models. Results indicate that: 1) This proposed Heterogenous KDM captures the directional anisotropies of temperatures in row-planted vineyard canopies, whereas the traditional point-spread KDM show limitations. In most cases, root mean squared errors (RMSE) improved up to 0.5 K. 2) A sensitivity analysis based on simulated datasets also showed a better performance of the new proposed KDM under different cases including LAI and row height/width. 3) Further simple validation using UAV and sandbox measurements has demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed KDM in urban and mountainous areas, where stripe characteristics in thermal radiation directionality are present. In conclusion, this study proposes a novel KDM with significant practical implications for heterogeneous scenarios."

 Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) export from non-point sources significantly threaten water quality in mountainous regions undergoing rapid agricultural intensification and urbanization. However, existing research often neglects multi-scale analyses across administrative levels and provides limited insight into the complex drivers of nutrient export in data-scarce mountainous regions. This study presents a novel integrated modeling framework by coupling the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model with Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression (GTWR) to analyze N and P export dynamics in Yunnan Province from 2000 to 2019. We reveal a temporal turning point around 2011, with declining nutrient exports before 2011 followed by a rising trend linked to policy changes and intensified land use. Spatially, high N and P export clusters occur in densely populated, agriculturally intensive central and southeastern Yunnan, while forested northwestern areas exhibit low export. Prefecture-scale drivers are dominated by population density, fertilizer application, and industrial activity, whereas county-scale drivers highlight cropland area, precipitation, and terrain factors. Importantly, natural and anthropogenic factors interact to shape nutrient export patterns, underscoring the need for spatially differentiated management. The integration of InVEST-GTWR reflects methodological innovations that capture spatio-temporal non-stationarity and provide actionable insights for targeted nutrient pollution control in mountainous regions, with high model accuracy (R2 = 0.98 at the prefecture scale and R2 = 0.95 at the county scale)."

The Cumulative Human Activity Intensity (CHAI) index, incorporating land use, nighttime lights, population density, GDP, and tourism activities, is introduced to assess human activity’s spatial impact on land surface temperature (LST). Key findings include: (1) The nighttime SUHI effect is more pronounced and spatially concentrated, with stronger LST warming and a northwestward shift of the SUHI core; (2) The impact of human activities on LST shows spatial heterogeneity, with urban areas experiencing stronger warming than suburban areas. Specifically, sparsely built areas (LCZ9) and open low-rise zones (LCZ6) contribute significantly to warming; (3) Human activities more strongly influence nighttime LST, with this effect intensified by the synergistic interaction between topographic and meteorological factors.

 Soil moisture (SM) is vital for comprehending the hydrological cycle and managing climatic extremes. Fine-scale accurate SM products hold more and more significant value to water management and precise agricultural irrigation. While in-situ measurements provide high accuracy, their limited spatial coverage and high costs necessitate alternative approaches. Remote sensing enables large-scale monitoring; however, satellite-based SM products have relatively lower spatial resolution, making them less suitable for practical applications. This study presents an innovative high-resolution surface soil moisture (SSM) retrieval framework combining machine learning (ML), change detection and downscaling (CD-DS) methods. The procedure is applied over Catalonia, Spain. The framework integrates Sentinel-1 SAR, Sentinel-2 normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI), and DISPATCH background SSM data to generate 30-m resolution SSM. A novel backscatter difference variable, derived from the change detection method, improves model performance by addressing vegetation. The ML model was trained using in-situ SSM data collected from 2017 to 2021 and validated against independent in-situ measurement datasets. Among the evaluated algorithms, XGBoost model performed best, achieving an R2 of 0.933 and RMSE of 0.023 cm3/cm3. Validation with ground measurements with different landcover types showed an average correlation of 0.63, a ubRMSE of 0.045 cm3/cm3, and minimal bias of 0.024 cm3/cm3. Notably, backscatter difference emerged as the second most important variable in the ML model after background SSM, highlighting its significance in improving SSM retrieval accuracy. Comparisons with data from 54 measurement sites, obtained during a 2015 field campaign, yielded an R value of 0.82, a RMSE of 0.06 cm3/cm3. Temporal analysis revealed strong consistency with in-situ data, capturing seasonal trends and abrupt changes after precipitation and irrigation events. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of SSM is closely aligned with irrigation type maps, showing higher SSM values in irrigated areas and lower values in rainfed regions. This approach delivers precise field-scale SSM estimates, making it a valuable tool for drought monitoring and modern agricultural practices."

 A crop drought process generally consists of meteorological and agricultural drought periods. The temporal-spatial characteristics of meteorological and agricultural droughts during the summer maize (Zea mays L.) drought process from 2000 to 2020 in the Huang-Huai-Hai (HHH) region in China were investigated by using 10-day Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI10) and Vegetation Water Index (VWI) in this study. Variations of meteorological and agricultural droughts for summer maize were basically the same in terms of severity, frequency, extent, and centroid of drought in HHH from 2000 to 2020. Nevertheless, the spatial patterns of extents, high-frequency occurrences, and centroid migration for mild, moderate, and severe meteorological drought may not completely align with those for agricultural drought of the corresponding severity levels. Results indicated that agricultural drought severity was related to the stage in which the meteorological drought occurred. Spatially, drought frequency (>30 %) clustered in western Henan, eastern Shandong, and the northern HHH, with meteorological drought extents consistently exceeding agricultural drought. Three-dimensional drought-day structures revealed agricultural drought persistence while shorter meteorological drought durations, emphasizing recovery lag. The zonal variations of meteorological and agricultural drought centroids were respectively driven by the sea surface temperature (contribution of 58.39 %) and the mid-high latitude atmospheric circulation (contribution of 58.39 %), and the meridional variations of meteorological and agricultural drought centroids were respectively driven by mid-low latitude atmospheric circulation (contribution of 38.44 %) and sea surface temperature (contribution of 52.73 %). Different climatic drivers of the two types of droughts jointly shaped the same migration direction, resulting in consistency in the migration (slightly moving towards the southwest during 2000–2020) of the two types of drought events, with annual longitude variation of −0.05° and − 0.007°, and latitude variation of −0.02° and − 0.01° for meteorological and agricultural droughts, respectively.

 Global warming is driving increased cooling demand for air conditioning worldwide, yet the impacts of air conditioning waste heat (ACWH) on urban hydroclimatic extremes remain underexplored. The Shenzhen-Hong Kong area (SHA), one of China's most densely populated and energy-intensive coastal regions, exhibits a notable urban rain island effect. This study investigates the role of ACWH in summer short-duration intense rainfall (SDIR) events in the SHA using a high-resolution Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with a local climate zone (LCZ) map. The WRF model, with AC settings incorporated, effectively reproduces diurnal variations in local meteorological variables, particularly air temperature and rainfall distribution. Scenario comparisons (AC on/off) reveal that ACWH significantly increases the spatial heterogeneity of afternoon SDIR patterns, with peak rainfall intensity rising by an average of approximately 22 % in Shenzhen and 3 % in Hong Kong's urban areas. ACWH accounts for 12.87 ± 7.79 % of the net all-wave radiation over urban areas in pre-storm environments, altering the land–atmosphere energy balance mainly by increasing sensible heat flux, particularly in compact high-rise areas (LCZ1). This stronger surface heat flux enhances the urban heat island circulation and boundary layer instability (e.g., deepening the planetary boundary layer and raising the lifted condensation level) and carries more moisture supply from the ocean into the urban atmosphere, which together intensify local rainfall. Results underscore the significant role of ACWH in urban summer intense rainfall, emphasizing the need for future numerical models to incorporate AC-related dynamic processes to improve predictions of urban hydroclimatic extremes, especially in rapidly urbanizing cities with high cooling demand."

 Accurate precipitation estimation over the Tibetan Plateau is crucial yet challenging due to its complex terrain, pronounced diurnal thermal variations, and sparse in situ observations. This study comprehensively evaluates three widely used datasets—IMERG-V06F, IMERG-V07F, and ERA5-Land—against gauge observations, focusing on their performance in capturing overall precipitation characteristics and diurnal cycles. A novel bias decomposition method (BDM) is further applied to disaggregate the total bias (Tbias) into frequency (PF) and intensity (PI) components, thereby offering a more nuanced understanding of error sources. The results indicate that while all three datasets replicate the general southeast-to-northwest precipitation gradient, ERA5-Land exhibits a pronounced wet bias, primarily driven by an overestimation of precipitation frequency. IMERG-V07F outperforms IMERG-V06F in mitigating excessive precipitation peaks but introduces sporadic anomalies in regions of complex topography. The BDM analysis reveals a critical insight that ERA5-Land's substantial positive PF bias often masks its negative PI bias, leading to an overall Tbias magnitude deceptively appears similar to that of the IMERG products. Assessments of the diurnal cycle confirm systematic discrepancies in timing: IMERG datasets consistently predict earlier precipitation peak, whereas ERA5-Land triggers midday peaks prematurely. These findings underscore the importance of refining Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE)-based convective parameterizations, enhancing satellite retrieval algorithms for mountainous terrain, and integrating high-resolution observations. The application of the BDM provides a valuable diagnostic framework for targeting specific error components—either frequency or intensity—which can facilitate more accurate precipitation modeling and ultimately improve hydrological forecasts over the Tibetan Plateau."

 As a predominant mesoscale system in the middle Yangtze River basin, the Dabie vortex (DBV) has been widely investigated for its frequent occurrence and association with thunderstorms. However, its statistical relationships with thunderstorms remain unexplored. This study investigates statistical relationships between DBVs and thunderstorms in central/eastern China by using 2010–2018 ERA5 reanalysis and station observations. Key findings demonstrate that ∼55.2 % of DBVs are associated with thunderstorms, with notable variations among different types. Specifically, longer-lived (≥6 h) and mobile types of DBVs exhibit significantly higher thunderstorm co-occurrence rates (∼ 66.3 % and ∼ 79.7 %), in contrast to their shorter-lived (<6 h) and quasi-stationary counterparts. Longer-lived DBVs show thunderstorm and lightning activity peaking during maintenance and development stages respectively, while their shorter-lived counterparts primarily generate thunderstorms in formation stage and concentrate lightning activity in maintenance and dissipation stages. Thunderstorms predominantly occur in DBVs' southeastern quadrant (∼ 55.5 %), with this concentration increasing to ∼ 58.9 % for longer-lived DBVs, contrasting with the least active northwestern quadrant. DBVs' internal structure fundamentally modulates thunderstorm genesis through convective parameter optimization - enhanced energy potential, elevated moisture content, reduced lifting condensation level, intensified vertical wind shear, and amplified updraft intensity - thereby establishing favorable thermodynamic-dynamic regimes that systematically enhance storm development likelihood. DBVs-associated thunderstorms demonstrate greater dependence on dynamic forcings (vertical wind shear, ascending motion, low-level convergence) and moisture supply compared to non-DBV counterparts, with thermodynamic instability playing a subordinate role. Interactions between robust dynamic mechanisms and sufficient moisture availability enable efficient thunderstorm genesis even under suboptimal thermodynamic conditions, elucidating DBVs' unique convective modulation capabilities."

Our analysis shows that the relationship between meteorological and hydrological transitions is weak, with only 10% and 25% of the meteorological transitions propagating to the hydrosphere at monthly and annual time scales, respectively. Transition propagation is limited by the propagation of wet spells, in particular those with small precipitation intensities and volumes but favored in catchments with a direct link between precipitation and streamflow and limited storage influences.

However, whether NIMBY experience has spillover effects on support for related policy goals remains underexplored. As a typical case of NIMBYism, utility-scale renewable energy projects have faced significant local opposition across the U.S. In this paper, we investigate if an individual’s proximity to such projects correlates with their support for broader climate goals. Drawing on individual responses from three waves of cross-sectional U.S. Nationscape survey data (2019–2021), we constructed a comprehensive dataset by combining them with geocoded information on all utility-scale renewable energy projects for this period, as well as with county-level socioeconomic, political, and policy information. Our regression results show that proximity to wind or solar projects does not significantly influence climate policy preferences among Democrats or Republicans. However, for political Independents, living near wind turbines correlates with reduced opposition to climate policies, specifically large-scale investments for clean energy technology. These findings suggest that climate attitudes linked to renewable energy exposure are contingent on political affiliation. While strong partisans (Democrats and Republicans) remain unaffected by direct exposure to renewable energy projects, Independents—who are less anchored by partisan narratives—are more responsive to personal experience. Exposure to wind power does not necessarily create strong supporters for climate policy, but it shifts Independents away from outright opposition.

The model also struggles to capture the observed cloud phase and the relative concentration of cloud droplets and cloud ice. We constrain our model to measured aerosols to mitigate this issue. 
 Multilayered clouds are frequent in the Arctic, but their detailed analysis is underrepresented. Here, we simulate two cases observed during the 2019/2020 MOSAiC expedition using the ICosahedral Non-hydrostatic (ICON) model to explore the most accurate representation of these multilayer clouds. With a limited-area setup, we investigate how cloud layers respond to perturbations in cloud droplet activation, primary ice, and secondary ice production (SIP). Using the measured aerosol concentration, we constrain our model through a new immersion freezing parameterisation. We find that multilayered clouds are challenging to simulate in remote areas with sparsely assimilated thermodynamics and that large-scale biases in the global forcing carry over to high-resolution simulations. In terms of cloud microphysics, high-temperature ice-nucleating particles (INPs) are necessary to capture the cloud phase of warm mixed-phase clouds. However, constraining the model to the observed INPs is insufficient; a factor of 106 is required to reach observed ice mass concentrations, which is also achieved by including SIP. Breakup upon ice–ice collisions is explosive and can increase the cloud ice number concentration by a factor of 106. Furthermore, the seeder–feeder mechanism significantly boosts snowfall by a factor of 103. An accurate representation of these microphysical processes is crucial to simulate multilayer clouds."

Much of the storm volume contains weak vertical motions (a few centimeters per second), and most updrafts ≥ 0.5 m s-1 are small (< 1 km). Within 2 km of cloud radar echo top, stronger vertical motions and conditions for ice particle growth are more common. Overturning air motions near cloud top appear important for the production of snow particles. 
 The spatial distribution of surface snowfall accumulation is dependent on the 3D trajectories of ice particles and their residence times through regions of ice mass increases and decreases. We analyze 42 non-orographic, non-lake-effect winter storms in the northeastern and midwestern United States from the Investigation of Microphysics and Precipitation for Atlantic Coast-Threatening Snowstorms (IMPACTS) and Profiling of Winter Storms (PLOWS) field campaigns. In situ aircraft measurements (1 Hz, ∼ 100 m horizontal distance) yield key data on vertical air motions, relative humidity with respect to ice (RHice), and number concentration. When suitable airborne radar data are available, we sort the in situ measurements by distance from cloud radar echo top.In total, 90 % of updrafts (vertical air motion ≥0.5 m s−1) were ≤1.3 km across. Measurements obtained within 3 km of cloud echo top were nearly twice as likely (13 % versus 7 %) to have vertical velocities capable of lofting precipitation-sized ice compared to points sampled at lower levels. Below the near-cloud-top generating cell layer, most of the storm volume has RHice≤95 % consistent with sublimation.Rather than ice precipitation growth within broad areas of vertical air motions, observations indicate that ice growth in these storms primarily occurs episodically within layers of overturning cloud-top generating cells with scales ≤ a few kilometers. Below the generating cell layer, conditions for ice growth are rarer, and the ice particles usually either persist or shrink during most of their descent. The observed distributions of ambient in-cloud conditions provide benchmarks for evaluations of winter storm model output."

By running simulations with different setups, we found that seeding impact varies greatly with weather conditions. Seeding increased snow in stable weather but sometimes reduced it in stormy weather. This helps us to better understand when seeding works best to boost water supplies. 
 Winter precipitation over Australia's Snowy Mountains provides a  crucial water resource in the region. Cloud seeding has been operational to enhance snowfall and water storage. This study presents ensemble simulations to assess cloud seeding impacts across diverse meteorological conditions and evaluate associated model uncertainties. Nine seeding cases from 2016 to 2019 were simulated, with 18 ensemble members varying initialization datasets and model configurations. Two main storm categories were studied (convective vs. stratiform). Results demonstrate that simulated seeding efficacy highly depends on meteorological conditions. Stratiform cases exhibited consistent precipitation enhancement, while convective cases showed reductions and downwind shifts in precipitation. Significantly inter-member variability was also observed. Notably, simulations driven by the Bureau of Meteorology Atmospheric high-resolution Regional Reanalysis for Australia (BARRA) reanalysis dataset show better representation in supercooled liquid water. Aerosol and planetary boundary layer scheme variations also contributed to ensemble spread. The findings demonstrate the value of ensemble modeling for reliable cloud seeding assessment.

By combining four data sources, we obtained a detailed representation of the riverbed, with resolutions ranging from 2 to 100 m. This dataset will support future studies on water and nutrient exchanges between the Danube and the Black Sea and provide insights into the delta's buffer role within the understudied Danube–Black Sea continuum. 
 Acting as a buffer between the Danube and the Black Sea, the Danube Delta plays an important role in regulating the hydro-biochemical flows of this land–sea continuum. Despite its importance, very few studies have focused on the impact of the Danube Delta on the different fluxes between the Danube and the Black Sea. One of the first steps in characterizing this land–sea continuum is to describe the bathymetry of the delta. However, there are no complete, easily accessible bathymetric data on all three branches of the delta to support hydrodynamic, biogeochemical, or ecological studies. In this study, we aim to fill this gap by combining four different datasets, three in the river and one for the riverbanks, each varying in density and spatial distribution, to create a high-resolution bathymetry dataset. The bathymetric data were interpolated on a hybrid curvilinear–unstructured mesh with an anisotropic inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation method. The resulting product offers resolutions ranging from 2 m in a connection zone to 100 m in one of the straight unidirectional channels. Cross-validation of the dataset underlined the importance of the data source spatial pattern, with average root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 0.55 %, 6.3 %, and 27.6 % for river segments covered by the densest to coarsest datasets. These error rates are comparable to those observed in bathymetry interpolation in rivers with similar source datasets. The bathymetry presented in this study is the first unique, high-resolution, comprehensive, and easily accessible bathymetric model covering all three branches of the Danube Delta.

This allows us to detect smaller earthquakes than before, creating a catalogue of seismicity that contains far more events than other regional catalogues. 
 In this study we process 5 years of continuous seismic data, from 2017 to 2021, recorded by networks deployed along the Chilean convergent margin of western South America. We select a set of stations so that coverage is as continuous and consistent in time as possible. Thus, changes in the catalogue are mainly due to the processes responsible for the seismicity itself and not network artifacts. For phase picking, we use the deep-learning algorithm Earthquake Transformer, PyOcto for association, NonLinLoc for location and HypoDD for relocation. To handle the large spatial extent of the study area, we create a partitioning workflow that mitigates problems that arise from associator and location codes working in cartesian coordinates. This allows us to obtain a main seismicity catalogue with over 600.000 double-difference relocated events and a completeness magnitude of ~2.5, with events located using an existing 3D velocity model. While this provides better location accuracy than a 1D or 2D velocity model, it limits the final catalogue to the extent of the 3D velocity model which does not cover our whole study area. Therefore, we create a secondary seismicity catalogue for the region to the south of the 3D model.

This database will help reveal the mechanisms behind critical events like mass extinctions and major ocean changes, enhancing our understanding of Earth's long-term environmental processes. 
 Stable nitrogen isotope records preserved in marine sediments provide critical insights into Earth’s climate history and biospheric evolution. Although numerous studies have documented nitrogen isotope (δ15N) records across varied geological ages (Archean to Recent) and paleogeographic settings, the scientific community remains constrained by the absence of a standardized database to systematically investigate their spatiotemporal evolution. Here, we present the database of Deep-time Sediment Nitrogen Isotopes in Marine Systems (DSMS-NI), a comprehensive global compilation of δ15N data and associated geochemical parameters, spanning a vast collection of sediment samples dating from the Recent to the Archean. This database encompasses 71 040 δ15N records derived from 424 publications, systematically organized with 29 metadata fields categories (e.g., chronostratigraphic ages, coordinates, lithology, metamorphic grade, sedimentary facies, references) encompassing 1 927 829 metadata. This repository further incorporates 130 proxy data fields, including 285 715 geochemical data spanning total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and organic carbon isotopes (δ13Corg), major and trace elements and iron species. These integrated parameters enable evaluation of sample fidelity and factors influencing δ15N signatures. The DSMS-NI database will facilitate research across key geological intervals such as the Permian-Triassic boundary and the Cretaceous ocean anoxic events. Researchers can leverage temporal and paleogeographic information, alongside geochemical data, to conduct spatiotemporal analyses, thereby uncovering changes in deep-time marine nitrogen cycles and paleoenvironmental conditions. The database is open-access via the Geobiology portal (https://geobiologydata.cug.edu.cn/, last access: 30 April 2025), allowing users to access data and submit new entries to ensure continuous updates and expansion.

The code works across the ocean depths for the past, present, or future from information about the location, temperature, and salinity of the seawater. We produce a data product with estimates throughout the ocean throughout the last ~300 and the next ~500 years. 
 The ocean is one of the largest sinks for anthropogenic carbon dioxide (Canth) and its removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere has been valued at hundreds of billions to trillions of US dollars in climate mitigation annually. The ecosystem impacts caused by planet-wide shifts in ocean chemistry resulting from marine Canth accumulation are an active area of research. For these reasons, we need accessible tools to quantify ocean Canth inventories and distributions and to predict how they might evolve in response to future emissions and mitigation activities. Unfortunately, Canth estimation methods are typically only accessible to trained scientists and modelers with access to significant computational resources. Here, we make modifications to the transit time distribution approach for Canth estimation that render the method more accessible. We also release software (BRCScienceProducts, 2025) called “Tracer-based Rapid Anthropogenic Carbon Estimation version 1” (TRACEv1) that allows users – with one line of code – to obtain Canth and water mass age estimates throughout the global open ocean from user-supplied values of geographic location, pressure, salinity, temperature, and the estimate year. We use this code to generate a data product of global gridded open-ocean Canth distributions (TRACEv1_GGCanth; Carter, 2025) that ranges from the preindustrial era through 2500 under a range of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs, or atmospheric CO2 concentration pathways). We estimated the skill of these estimates by reconstructing Canth in models with known distributions of Canth and transient tracers and by conducting perturbation tests. In the model-based reconstruction test, TRACEv1 reproduces the global ocean Canth inventory to within ±10 % in 1980 and 2014. We discuss implications and limitations of the projected Canth distributions and highlight ways that the estimation strategy might be improved. One finding is that the ocean will continue to increase its net Canth inventory at least through 2500 due to deep-ocean ventilation, even with the SSP in which intense mitigation successfully decreases atmospheric Canth by ∼60 % in 2500 relative to the 2024 concentration. A notable limitation of this and similar projections made with TRACEv1 is that ongoing and potential future warming and changing oceanic circulation patterns with climate change are not captured by the method.

We show that by doing so we can achieve a more optimal simulation accuracy for the available computing resources compared to uniform-resolution simulations. 
 Glaciological modelling is a computationally challenging task due to its high cost and complexity associated with large spatial-scale and long timescale simulations. In this paper we propose feature-based anisotropic mesh adaptation methods and demonstrate their effectiveness for time-dependent glaciological modelling on a Marine Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project (MISMIP+) experiment. Our methods use the Python-based Firedrake finite element library and the mmg2d remeshing software. We show that we are able to achieve solution accuracy comparable to uniform 0.5 km resolution mesh simulations using a sequence of adapted meshes with, on average, 30 times fewer vertices when adapting meshes based on the basal stress and 8–12 times fewer when adapting based on ice thickness and velocity. We further introduce a novel hybrid time-dependent fixed-point mesh adaptation algorithm that reaches mesh convergence approximately twice as fast compared with the existing global fixed-point algorithm. Since the fixed-point algorithms require that the problem is solved multiple times, the reported reduction in the number of vertices ultimately translates into a 3–6 times lower overall computational cost compared to uniform mesh simulations."

Driven by the need to better understand climate change and its impacts, these models have become increasingly sophisticated over time, generating vast amounts of data. To effectively evaluate the complex state-of-the-art ESMs and ensure their reliability, new tools for comprehensive analysis are essential. The open-source community-driven Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool) addresses this critical need by providing a software package for scientists to assess the performance of ESMs using common diagnostics and metrics. In this paper, we describe recent significant improvements of ESMValTool's computational efficiency, which allow a more effective evaluation of these complex ESMs and also high-resolution models. These optimizations include parallel computing (execute multiple computation tasks simultaneously), out-of-core computing (process data larger than available memory), and distributed computing (spread computation tasks across multiple interconnected nodes or machines). When comparing the latest ESMValTool version with a previous not yet optimized version, we find significant performance improvements for many relevant applications running on a single node of a high-performance computing (HPC) system, ranging from 2.3 times faster runs in a multi-model setup up to 23 times faster runs for processing a single high-resolution model. By utilizing distributed computing on two nodes of an HPC system, these speedup factors can be further improved to 3.0 and 44, respectively. Moreover, evaluation runs with the latest version of ESMValTool also require significantly less computational resources than before, which in turn reduces power consumption and thus the overall carbon footprint of ESMValTool runs. For example, the previously mentioned use cases use 2.3 (multi-model evaluation) and 23 (high-resolution model evaluation) times less resources compared to the reference version on one HPC node. Finally, analyses which could previously only be performed on machines with large amounts of memory can now be conducted on much smaller hardware through the use of out-of-core computation. For instance, the high-resolution single-model evaluation use case can now be run with 8 GB of available memory despite an input data size of 35 GB, which was not possible with earlier versions of ESMValTool. This enables running much more complex evaluation tasks on a personal laptop than before."

Nix is a computer programme that simulates the movement and temperature evolution in ice sheets. It helps us study how ice sheets respond to changes in the atmosphere and ocean. We found that ice temperatures play an essential role in determining the motion and stability of ice sheets. Nix is a useful tool for learning how climate change affects polar ice sheets. 
 We present a physical description of the ice-sheet model Nix v1.0, an open-source project intended for collaborative development. Nix is a two-dimensional (flowline combined with a vertical dimension) thermomechanical model written in C and C++ that simultaneously solves for the momentum balance equations, mass conservation and temperature evolution. Nix's velocity solver includes a hierarchy of Stokes approximations: Blatter–Pattyn, depth-integrated higher order and shallow shelf. The grounding-line position is explicitly solved by a moving coordinate system that avoids further interpolations. The model can be easily forced with any external boundary conditions. Nix has been verified for standard test problems, showing versatility from regular machines (lightweight memory allocation) to high-performance computing (multi-threading capabilities). Resolutions below 0.1 km are attainable even with minimal computational resources: Nix's serial run finalizes within hours on a single CPU. Here we show results for a number of benchmark experiments from the Marine Ice Sheet Intercomparison Project (MISMIP) and assess grounding-line migration with an overdeepened bed geometry. Lastly, we further exploit the thermomechanical coupling by designing a suite of experiments where the forcing is a physical variable, unlike previously idealized forcing scenarios where ice temperatures are implicitly fixed via an ice rate factor. That is, we use atmospheric temperature and oceanic temperature anomalies to assess model hysteresis behaviour with active thermodynamics. Our results show that hysteresis in an overdeepened bed geometry is similar for atmospheric and oceanic forcings. Notably, the classical hysteresis loop is widened for both forcing scenarios (i.e. atmospheric and oceanic) if the ice sheet is thermomechanically active as a result of the internal feedback among ice temperature, stress balance and viscosity. These results show that a temperature-dependent ice viscosity provides inertia and stability to the ice sheet, regardless of the particular external forcing applied. In summary, Nix combines rapid computational capabilities with a Blatter–Pattyn stress balance fully coupled to a thermomechanical solver, not only validating against established benchmarks but also offering a powerful tool for advancing our insight into ice dynamics and grounding-line stability."

Using a novel combination of high-frequency photography and fluorescent particles, we compared the transport of three MPs to that of a sand particle during rainfall simulations: linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), polystyrene (PS), and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). We measured the “real time” movement of particles on the soil surface alongside the number of particles transported through splash erosion and surface runoff. Our results show that MPs of all polymer types demonstrated more rapid transport from the soil surface compared to sand particles throughout the rainfall simulations. Prior to surface runoff, ∼65–75% of MPs and sand particles were removed from the soil surface through raindrop-driven incorporation into the soil matrix. Surface runoff and splash erosion accounted for the transport of approximately 47% of PMMA and 57% of PS, while only 30% of sand particles were mobilized by these processes. This research establishes a benchmark for evaluating MP mobility to current knowledge of soil particle movement, which is critical for estimating the redistribution of MPs within soils and their ultimate flux to aquatic ecosystems."

Phytotoxic hydrogen sulfides (H2S) and light deprivation are known drivers of seagrass loss worldwide; however, the underlying physiological mechanisms are not well understood. To address this knowledge gap, we explored the fate of inorganic carbon (Ci) in Halophila ovalis which were exposed to either low light (88% shade), (ii) sediment H2S stress, or (iii) both stressors combined in a mesocosm setting. Using a novel multidisciplinary approach in combination with a 13C tracer (NaH13CO3), we investigated differences in Ci acquisition, metabolite incorporation, and carbon translocation. Ci acquisition into seagrass leaves was impacted by both H2S and low light stress, synergistically reducing carbon acquisition rates by 10.9-fold. The incorporation of 13C into leaf sugar pools was also affected by both stressors. In addition, low light impacted  critical intermediates of both glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Below-ground data suggest that H2S interferes with carbon translocation from the leaf into the rhizome and caused an 85% reduction in rhizome growth, irrespective of light. Overall, this study suggests that it is likely a multilevel (acquisition, metabolism, translocation) disruption of the carbon budget that threatens seagrass health and survival under both H2S and low light stress."

This study investigated the differential impacts of S-nZVI and nZVI on the dechlorination activity of Dehalococcoides mccartyi strain 195 (Dhc 195), a representative OHRB. Key factors, including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), pH, Fe2+ concentration, and nanoparticle–cell interactions, were assessed. S-nZVI exhibited significantly lower cytotoxicity compared to nZVI, primarily due to the reduced nanoparticle adhesion to Dhc 195 cell membranes, attributed to its negative surface charge rather than to the milder physicochemical disturbances in the culture medium. S-nZVI minimally disrupted extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), preserving cell integrity, and provided a more sustained hydrogen supply under hydrogen-limited conditions. Limited contact experiments confirmed that the reduced cytotoxicity of S-nZVI stemmed from lower contact toxicity rather than its intrinsic chemical reactivity. This study unveils the mechanisms underlying the interaction between S-nZVI and OHRB, highlighting S-nZVI’s potential for safer and more effective abiotic–biotic remediation strategies.

However, field data on ARG-MP copollution remain scarce, hindering environmental risk assessment of ARGs. This study used metagenomic sequencing and high-throughput qPCR to examine the composition and association of ARGs and MPs in sewage discharge-receiving waters. The results indicated that sewage discharge significantly increased the abundance of ARG-MP complexes in receiving waters, with fibrous and fragmented MPs exhibiting enhanced ARG enrichment and thereby serving as selective vectors for pathogens. Effluents promoted plasmid-mediated gene transfer and microbial functional shifts, driving intracellular ARG proliferation in the plastisphere. Fibrous and fragmented MPs showed strong co-occurrence patterns with ARGs, virulence factor genes, and mobile genetic elements, suggesting their role in antimicrobial resistance dissemination. A projection pursuit regression model indicated effluent-induced MP risk escalation at the estuary and downstream areas, which was associated with fragmented and polyamide MPs. Notably, WWTPs released substantial extracellular ARGs, with MPs potentially serving as a protective niche and a proliferative microenvironment. Here, we determined the role of WWTPs in shaping the aquatic resistome via MPs, which provides critical data for risk assessment and control strategies."

We therefore developed a new rectangular zero-gap cell design featuring an extended flow path to improve hydrogen retention and conversion to biomethane. Multiphase flow modeling within porous carbon felt cathodes revealed the new configuration with a trapezoidal inlet substantially reduced flow dead zones and tripled hydrogen retention time versus circular cells. At −1 V vs Ag/AgCl, increasing catholyte flow rate from 0.8 to 2.5 mL/min raised current densities from 19 to 24 A/m2 (30 °C), reaching a peak Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 82% for methane production (7.0 L/L-d). Further increasing the flow rate to 7.5 mL/min or temperature to 37 °C slightly improved methane production (7.2–7.7 L/L-d) but reduced hydrogen retention in cells based on modeling results, lowering CEs and energy efficiencies due to unreacted hydrogen. Matching cathode potential to flow rates and temperatures could balance H2 production and retention, significantly improving CE to 96% toward 7.5 L/L-d methane production with a high energy efficiency of 36% (−0.95 V vs Ag/AgCl, 37 °C).

While the ecological implications of browning have received considerable attention, its impacts on the photochemical production of reactive intermediates from DOM remain understudied despite their importance for biogeochemical processes and contaminant fate in sunlit surface waters. To address this gap, we investigated singlet oxygen (1O2) production in 37 lakes within the Adirondack Long-Term Monitoring (ALTM) program. Wavelet coherence tests confirmed the synchrony between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and color as well as the time-scale-dependent influence of regional atmospheric and hydroclimatic factors on DOC dynamics in these lakes. Hydrogeological conditions of lake watersheds (e.g., hydrologic connectivity and surficial geology) and seasonal variations in DOM quality jointly shaped the spatiotemporal patterns of the apparent quantum yields of 1O2. Within the euphotic zone, depth-averaged steady-state concentrations of 1O2 were higher in lakes experiencing more intense browning, as operationally defined through trend analyses of long-term water chemistry data; however, the relevance of 1O2-mediated reactions depends on the time scales of photochemical transformation relative to lake flushing.

To illustrate this framework, we used 37, 9, and 28 species-dependent inactivation rate constants for ultraviolet (UV), ozone, and free chlorine, respectively, from systematic reviews. We estimated the sensitivity distributions of these disinfectants by incorporating the uncertainty in the individual inactivation rate constants using a Bayesian framework.

We used two sonic anemometers elevated at fixed height above the mean ocean surface to measure sensible heat fluxes using the eddy covariance method during the near‐passage of TC Olwyn and Quang. We do so after empirically deriving a conversion factor between virtual temperature, as measured by the anemometer, and the absolute temperature. We find that the magnitudes of these fluxes during the passage of the TC largely agree with COARE 3.6, but have opposite sign.

Ions in the range below about 1 keV/q were slowed within the Alfvén wing. As with other measurements in Io's Alfvén wing, we observe evidence of filamentation.

At present, there is no consensus on the energy source of BL. The radiation power density and its evolution of a BL are investigated based on its spectra for the first time. The results show that the radiation power density calculated by O I spectral lines is the highest, and its average value is about 37.40 × 107 W/m2. The average radiation power densities calculated by Si I and Fe I spectral lines are only around 3.04 × 107 W/m2 and 2.56 × 107 W/m2, which remained basically steady during the stable luminescence stage. The spectral and energy feature indicated that the BL maybe exist a core with higher energy. The radiation power density shows a periodic pulse feature in the energy core and maintains basically stable in the bright periphery with lower energy. The highest energy of this BL can only excite light radiation of the near infrared band from the O I atoms in the air. The BL moved toward the nearby power line. Deduced from the energy distribution and moving direction that this BL should be associated with small gap intermittent discharge at the bottom of previous cloud‐to‐ground (CG) lightning channel, meanwhile, the strong atmospheric electric field during thunderstorm and its distribution should be a potential outside source that drives the discharge and moving direction of this BL.

However, the differential impacts of dry versus wet heat waves and their future trajectories remain underexplored. Here, we introduce a data‐driven approach to classify heat waves by relative humidity, revealing dry heat waves predominantly affect China's arid northwest, while wet heat waves are more prevalent in its humid south. These events' frequency and persistence have increased substantially over recent decades. Under a high socioeconomic scenario, the intensified dry and wet heat waves will continue expanding, with increases of approximately 141% ± 48% and 224% ± 59% by the 21st century's end. Population exposure to wet heat waves is projected to increase by about 100% ± 36%, nearly doubling that of dry heat waves, with North China facing the highest risks. By then, an estimated 10% and 40% of China's population will face exposure to dangerous dry and wet heat waves. Adopting a moderate socioeconomic development pathway could substantially mitigate these risks.

Yet, the responses of fungal spores—organisms important to ecosystems and major airborne allergens—remain understudied. This knowledge gap limits our understanding of their ecological and public health implications. To address this, we analyzed a long‐term (2003–2022), large‐scale (the continental US) data set of airborne fungal spores collected by the US National Allergy Bureau. We first pre‐processed the spore data by gap‐filling and smoothing. Afterward, we extracted 10 metrics describing the phenology (e.g., start and end of season) and intensity (e.g., peak concentration and integral) of fungal spore seasons. These metrics were derived using two complementary but not mutually exclusive approaches—ecological and public health approaches, defined as percentiles of total spore concentration and allergenic thresholds of spore concentration, respectively. Using linear mixed‐effects models, we quantified annual shifts in these metrics across the continental US. We revealed a significant advancement in the onset of the spore seasons defined in both ecological (11 days, 95% confidence interval: 0.4–23 days) and public health (22 days, 6–38 days) approaches over two decades. Meanwhile, total spore concentrations in an annual cycle and in a spore allergy season tended to decrease over time. The earlier start of the spore season was significantly correlated with climatic variables, such as warmer temperatures and altered precipitations. Overall, our findings suggest possible climate‐driven advanced fungal spore seasons, highlighting the importance of climate change mitigation and adaptation in public health decision‐making."

 Alkenes are a central part of organic chemistry1–3. However, although most alkenes are easy to prepare, the controlled synthesis of tetrasubstituted alkenes, those with four groups around the central C=C bond, remains challenging1–5. Here we report the boron-mediated assembly of tetrasubstituted alkenes with complete control of the double-bond geometry. The migrating group and electrophile add syn across the alkyne. Mild oxidation leads to intermediate borinic esters6, which can be isolated and purified or reacted directly in a range of transformations, including cross-couplings and homologation reactions. In particular, subjecting the intermediate borinic esters to Zweifel7,8 olefination conditions can give either retention or inversion of the double-bond geometry, depending on whether base is present or not. Different positional and stereoisomers of the tetrasubstituted alkenes can be easily accessed, highlighting the breadth and versatility of the method. This was showcased through its successful application to the rapid synthesis of drug molecules and natural products with high yield and stereocontrol. Not only does this method provide efficient access to the long-standing challenge of the stereocontrolled synthesis of tetrasubstituted alkenes but it also introduces new concepts related to the intervention of non-classical borenium ions in the Zweifel olefination.

 Natural chiral polymers, such as DNA, proteins, cellulose and poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate] ((R)-P3HB), are prevalent in their enantiopure forms1,2. Existing methods to synthesize enantiopure polymers focus on enantiospecific polymerization, in which only one specific enantiomer is obtained from the corresponding chiral monomer3–6. Here we introduce a catalytic stereodivergent synthetic strategy to access all enantiopure di-isotactic poly(3-hydroxyalkanoate) (PHA) diastereomers from bacterial (R)-P3HB as the single chiral source. A series of enantiopure (R,R)-α-alkylated-β-butyrolactones are obtained from (R)-P3HB and then subjected to the catalyst-controlled diastereodivergent ring-opening polymerization (ROP) to enantiopure di-isotactic α-alkylated PHAs. Metal-catalysed coordination–insertion ROP results in threo-(R,R)-di-isotactic PHAs with chiral retention, whereas anionic ROP catalysed by an organic superbase produces erythro-(R,S)-di-isotactic PHAs with chiral inversion, achieving precision di-isotactic PHAs with exclusive regio- and stereoregularity. This strategy has also enabled the stereodivergent synthesis of all four [(R,R), (S,S), (R,S) and (S,R)] stereoisomers of α,α-dialkylated PHAs from (R)-P3HB, which can be depolymerized to chiral α,α-dialkylated-β-butyrolactones with high stereoselectivity. Overall, this catalyst-controlled regio- and stereoselective, stereodivergent synthetic methodology provides access to 16 enantiopure stereoisomers of α(α)-(di)substituted PHAs and enables the stereochemistry-defined structure–property relationship study of the di-isotactic PHAs, providing insights into the effects of main-chain stereoconfigurations and alkyl side chains on their thermal properties, melt processability, mechanical performance and supramolecular stereocomplexation.

 In a classic example of adaptation, harmless Batesian mimics gain protection from predators through resemblance to one or more unpalatable models1,2. Mimics vary greatly in accuracy, and explaining the persistence of inaccurate mimics is an ongoing challenge for evolutionary biologists3,4. Empirical testing of existing hypotheses is constrained by the difficulty of assessing the fitness of phenotypes absent among extant species, leaving large parts of the adaptive landscape unexplored5—a problem affecting the study of the evolution of most complex traits. Here, to address this, we created mimetic phenotypes that occupy hypothetical areas of trait space by morphing between 3D images of real insects (flies and wasps), and tested the responses of real predators to high-resolution, full-colour 3D-printed reproductions of these phenotypes. We found that birds have an excellent ability to learn to discriminate among insects on the basis of subtle differences in appearance, but this ability is weaker for pattern and shape than for colour and size traits. We found that mimics gained no special protection from intermediate resemblance to multiple model phenotypes. However, discrimination ability was lower in some invertebrate predators (especially crab spiders and mantises), highlighting that the predator community is key to explaining the apparent inaccuracy of many mimics.

 Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a predatory bacterium that non-selectively preys on Gram-negative bacteria by invading the prey-cell periplasm, leaching host nutrients and ultimately lysing the infected cell to exit and find a new host1,2. The predatory life cycle of B. bacteriovorus is, in many ways, comparable to a bacteriophage. However, unlike phage defence, defence against B. bacteriovorus has not been widely investigated. Here we screened a collection of diverse Escherichia coli strains for resistance to B. bacteriovorus and identified that roughly one-third of strains robustly defended against predation by producing curli fibres. Curli fibres are oligomers of the functional amyloid protein CsgA, which is exceptionally durable3. Using genetics and microscopy, we demonstrate that curli fibres provide a barrier that protects susceptible cells independent of genes required for biofilm formation. This barrier further protected E. coli against attack by the predatory bacterium Myxococcus xanthus and select phages. Bioinformatic analysis of bacterial amyloids showed these systems are diverse and widespread in diderm bacteria (those with both inner and outer membranes). One of these, an evolutionarily distinct amyloid encoded by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, also protected against B. bacteriovorus. This work establishes that functional amyloids defend bacteria against a wide range of threats.

 From fertilization onwards, the cells of the human body acquire variations in their DNA sequence, known as somatic mutations. These postzygotic mutations arise from intrinsic errors in DNA replication and repair, as well as from exposure to mutagens. Somatic mutations have been implicated in some diseases, but a fundamental understanding of the frequency, type and patterns of mutations across healthy human tissues has been limited. This is primarily due to the small proportion of cells harbouring specific somatic variants within an individual, making them more challenging to detect than inherited variants. Here we describe the Somatic Mosaicism across Human Tissues Network, which aims to create a reference catalogue of somatic mutations and their clonal patterns across 19 different tissue sites from 150 non-diseased donors and develop new technologies and computational tools to detect somatic mutations and assess their phenotypic consequences, including clonal expansions. This strategy enables a comprehensive examination of the mutational landscape across the human body, and provides a comparison baseline for somatic mutation in diseases. This will lead to a deep understanding of somatic mutations and clonal expansions across the lifespan, as well as their roles in health, in ageing and, by comparison, in diseases.

 Biomolecular condensates are key features of intracellular compartmentalization1,2. As the most prominent nuclear condensate in eukaryotes, the nucleolus is a multiphase liquid-like structure in which ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) are transcribed and processed, undergoing multiple maturation steps to form the small (SSU) and large (LSU) ribosomal subunits3–5. However, how rRNA processing is coupled to the layered organization of the nucleolus is poorly understood owing to a lack of tools to precisely monitor and perturb nucleolar rRNA processing dynamics. Here we developed two complementary approaches to spatiotemporally map rRNA processing and engineer de novo nucleoli. Using sequencing in parallel with imaging, we found that rRNA processing steps are spatially segregated, with sequential maturation of rRNA required for its outward movement through nucleolar phases. By generating synthetic nucleoli in cells using an engineered rDNA plasmid system, we show that defects in SSU processing can alter the ordering of nucleolar phases, resulting in inside-out nucleoli and preventing rRNA outflux, while LSU precursors are necessary to build the outermost layer of the nucleolus. These findings demonstrate how rRNA is both a scaffold and substrate for the nucleolus, with rRNA acting as a programmable blueprint for the multiphase architecture that facilitates assembly of an essential molecular machine. Spatially segregated rRNA processing dictates nucleolar morphology and drives outward progression of pre-ribosomal RNA through nucleolar phases."

 Climate assessments of civil aviation1,2 have consistently quantified the dominant climate-forcing components: (1) CO2 emissions, (2) NOx (NO + NO2) emissions and (3) persistent contrails. All three components exert a positive radiative forcing (RF) and lead to climate warming of similar magnitudes. The aviation community is actively seeking to reduce its climate footprint through advanced engine technologies, more sustainable aviation fuel and optimal routing plans3–12. These approaches usually involve a trade-off of CO2 against NOx or contrails (non-CO2), such as burning 1% more fuel to decrease contrail RF by 4%. Here, we show that a climate-trade-off risk curve derived from uncertainties in the RF components2,13–16 can give the probability that a specified trade-off ratio will produce a climate benefit. For each component, we calculate the integrated effective RF resulting from 1 year of flights: global warming per activity (GWA). The complementary cumulative probability distribution of the GWA(non-CO2) to GWA(CO2) ratio results in a climate-trade-off risk curve giving the likelihood of a positive climate outcome as a function of the trade-off-CO2 to trade-off-non-CO2 ratio, because the product, GWA × trade-off, should be the same for both. We find a likely (67%) chance of climate mitigation on a 100-year time horizon for the above suggested ratio of 1:4, favouring proposed non-CO2 mitigation efforts3–12 with ratios smaller than this. A climate-trade-off risk curve derived from uncertainties in the radiative-forcing components indicates that focusing on reducing contrails or nitrogen oxide emissions is more effective than reducing CO2 emissions."

 Classical mechanics characterizes the kinetic energy of a particle, the energy it holds due to its motion, as consistently positive. By contrast, quantum mechanics describes the motion of particles using wave functions, in which regions of negative local kinetic energy can emerge1. This phenomenon occurs when the amplitude of the wave function experiences notable decay, typically associated with quantum tunnelling. Here, we investigate the quantum mechanical motion of particles in a system of two coupled waveguides, in which the population transfer between the waveguides acts as a clock, allowing particle speeds along the waveguide axis to be determined. By applying this scheme to exponentially decaying quantum states at a reflective potential step, we determine an energy–speed relationship for particles with negative local kinetic energy. We find that the smaller the energy of the particles—in other words, the more negative the local kinetic energy—the higher the measured speed inside the potential step. Our findings contribute to the ongoing tunnelling time debate2–6 and can be viewed as a test of Bohmian trajectories in quantum mechanics7–9. Regarding the latter, we find that the measured energy–speed relationship does not align with the particle dynamics postulated by the guiding equation in Bohmian mechanics. The study of the relationship between particle speed and negative kinetic energy, arising in regions in which, according to classical mechanics, particles are not allowed to enter, reveals behaviour that appears to contradict the predictions of Bohmian mechanics."

 Although most mammalian transcriptional enhancers regulate their cognate promoters over distances of tens of kilobases, some enhancers act over distances in the megabase range1. The sequence features that enable such long-distance enhancer–promoter interactions remain unclear. Here we used in vivo enhancer-replacement experiments at the mouse Shh locus to show that short- and medium-range limb enhancers cannot initiate gene expression at long-distance range. We identify a cis-acting element, range extender (REX), that confers long-distance regulatory activity and is located next to a long-range limb enhancer of Sall1. The REX element has no endogenous enhancer activity. However, addition of the REX to other short- and mid-range limb enhancers substantially increases their genomic interaction range. In the most extreme example observed, addition of REX increased the range of an enhancer by an order of magnitude from its native 73 kb to 848 kb. The REX element contains highly conserved [C/T]AATTA homeodomain motifs that are critical for its activity. These motifs are enriched in long-range limb enhancers genome-wide, including the ZRS (zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) regulatory sequence), a benchmark long-range limb enhancer of Shh2. The ZRS enhancer with mutated [C/T]AATTA motifs maintains limb activity at short range, but loses its long-range activity, resulting in severe limb reduction in knock-in mice. In summary, we identify a sequence signature associated with long-range enhancer–promoter interactions and describe a prototypical REX element that is necessary and sufficient to confer long-distance activation by remote enhancers. The REX element is associated with long-range enhancer–promoter interactions."

 The North Eurasian forest and forest-steppe zones have sustained millennia of sociocultural connections among northern peoples, but much of their history is poorly understood. In particular, the genomic formation of populations that speak Uralic and Yeniseian languages today is unknown. Here, by generating genome-wide data for 180 ancient individuals spanning this region, we show that the Early-to-Mid-Holocene hunter-gatherers harboured a continuous gradient of ancestry from fully European-related in the Baltic, to fully East Asian-related in the Transbaikal. Contemporaneous groups in Northeast Siberia were off-gradient and descended from a population that was the primary source for Native Americans, which then mixed with populations of Inland East Asia and the Amur River Basin to produce two populations whose expansion coincided with the collapse of pre-Bronze Age population structure. Ancestry from the first population, Cis-Baikal Late Neolithic–Bronze Age (Cisbaikal_LNBA), is associated with Yeniseian-speaking groups and those that admixed with them, and ancestry from the second, Yakutia Late Neolithic–Bronze Age (Yakutia_LNBA), is associated with migrations of prehistoric Uralic speakers. We show that Yakutia_LNBA first dispersed westwards from the Lena River Basin around 4,000 years ago into the Altai-Sayan region and into West Siberian communities associated with Seima-Turbino metallurgy—a suite of advanced bronze casting techniques that expanded explosively from the Altai1. The 16 Seima-Turbino period individuals were diverse in their ancestry, also harbouring DNA from Indo-Iranian-associated pastoralists and from a range of hunter-gatherer groups. Thus, both cultural transmission and migration were key to the Seima-Turbino phenomenon, which was involved in the initial spread of early Uralic-speaking communities. Genome-wide sequencing of 180 ancient individuals shows a continuous gradient of ancestry in Early-to-Mid-Holocene hunter-gatherers from the Baltic to the Transbaikal region and distinct contemporaneous groups in Northeast Siberia, and provides insights into the origins of modern Uralic and Yeniseian speakers."

 Ultimate limits for the sensing of fields and forces are set by the quantum noise of a sensor1–3. Entanglement allows for suppression of such noise and for achieving sensitivity beyond standard quantum limits4–7. Applicability of quantum optical sensing is often restricted by fixed wavelengths of available photonic quantum sources. Another ubiquitous limitation is associated with challenges of achieving quantum-noise-limited sensitivity in the acoustic noise frequency range relevant for several applications. Here we demonstrate a tool for broadband quantum sensing by performing quantum state processing that can be applied to a wide range of the optical spectrum and by suppressing quantum noise over an octave in the acoustic frequency range. An atomic spin ensemble is strongly coupled to one of the frequency-tunable beams of an Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) source of light. The other EPR beam of light, entangled with the first one, is tuned to a disparate wavelength. Engineering the spin ensemble to act as a negative-mass or positive-mass oscillator, we demonstrate frequency-dependent quantum noise reduction for measurements at the disparate wavelength. The tunability of the spin ensemble enables targeting quantum noise in a variety of systems with dynamics ranging from kHz to MHz. As an example of broadband quantum noise reduction in the acoustic frequency range, we analyse the applicability of our approach to gravitational-wave detectors (GWDs). Other possible applications include continuous-variable quantum repeaters and distributed quantum sensing.

 Methanogenic archaea are the main producers of the potent greenhouse gas methane1,2. In the methanogenic pathway from CO2 and H2 studied under laboratory conditions, low-potential electrons for CO2 reduction are generated by a flavin-based electron-bifurcation reaction catalysed by heterodisulfide reductase (Hdr) complexed with the associated [NiFe]-hydrogenase (Mvh)3–5. F420-reducing [NiFe]-hydrogenase (Frh) provides electrons to the methanogenic pathway through the electron carrier F420 (ref. 6). Here we report that under strictly nickel-limited conditions, in which the nickel concentration is similar to those often observed in natural habitats7–11, the production of both [NiFe]-hydrogenases in Methanothermobacter marburgensis is strongly downregulated. The Frh reaction is substituted by a coupled reaction with [Fe]-hydrogenase (Hmd), and the role of Mvh is taken over by F420-dependent electron-donating proteins (Elp). Thus, Hmd provides all electrons for the reducing metabolism under these nickel-limited conditions. Biochemical and structural characterization of Elp–Hdr complexes confirms the electronic interaction between Elp and Hdr. The conservation of the genes encoding Elp and Hmd in CO2-reducing hydrogenotrophic methanogens suggests that the Hmd system is an alternative pathway for electron flow in CO2-reducing hydrogenotrophic methanogens under nickel-limited conditions.

 The efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy in solid tumours is limited by immunosuppression and antigen heterogeneity1–3. To overcome these barriers, ‘armoured’ CAR T cells, which secrete proinflammatory cytokines, have been developed4. However, their clinical application has been limited because of toxicity related to peripheral expression of the armouring transgene5. Here, we have developed a CRISPR knock-in strategy that leverages the regulatory mechanisms of endogenous genes to drive transgene expression in a tumour-localized manner. By screening endogenous genes with tumour-restricted expression, we have identified the NR4A2 and RGS16 promoters as promising candidates to support the delivery of cytokines such as IL-12 and IL-2 directly to the tumour site, leading to enhanced antitumour efficacy and long-term survival of mice in both syngeneic and xenogeneic models. This effect was concomitant with improved CAR T cell polyfunctionality, activation of endogenous antitumour immunity and a favourable safety profile, and was applicable in CAR T cells from patients.

 Social interaction can be regarded as a dynamic feedback loop between interacting individuals as they act and react to each other1,2. Here, to understand the neural basis of these interactions, we investigated inter-brain neural dynamics across individuals in both mice and artificial intelligence systems. By measuring activities of molecularly defined neurons in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex of socially interacting mice, we find that the multi-dimensional neural space within each individual can be partitioned into two distinct subspaces—a shared neural subspace that represents shared neural dynamics across animals and a unique neural subspace that represents activity unique to each animal. Notably, compared with glutamatergic neurons, GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid-producing) neurons in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex contain a considerably larger shared neural subspace, which arises from behaviours of both self and others. We extended this framework to artificial intelligence agents and observed that, as social interactions emerged, so too did shared neural dynamics between interacting agents. Importantly, selectively disrupting the neural components that contribute to shared neural dynamics substantially reduces the agents’ social actions. Our findings suggest that shared neural dynamics represent a fundamental and generalizable feature of interacting neural systems present in both biological and artificial agents and highlight the functional significance of shared neural dynamics in driving social interactions.

 In the past decade, hundreds of exoplanets have been discovered in extremely short orbits below 10 days. Unlike in the Solar System, planets in these systems orbit their host stars close enough to disturb the stellar magnetic field lines1. The interaction can enhance the magnetic activity of the star, such as its chromospheric2 and radio3 emission or flaring4. So far, the search for magnetic star–planet interactions has remained inconclusive. Here we report the detection of planet-induced flares on HIP 67522, a 17 million-year-old G dwarf star with two known close-in planets5,6. Combining space-borne photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and dedicated Characterising Exoplanets Telescope observations over 5 years, we find that the 15 flares in HIP 67522 cluster near the transit phase of the innermost planet, indicating persistent magnetic star–planet interaction in the system. The stability of interaction implies that the innermost planet is continuously self-inflicting a six times higher flare rate than it would experience without interaction. The subsequent flux of energetic radiation and particles bombarding HIP 67522 b may explain the remarkably extended atmosphere of the planet, recently detected with the James Webb Space Telescope7. HIP 67522 is, therefore, an archetype to understand the impact of magnetic star–planet interaction on the atmospheres of nascent exoplanets.

 Establishing a unified theory of cognition has been an important goal in psychology1,2. A first step towards such a theory is to create a computational model that can predict human behaviour in a wide range of settings. Here we introduce Centaur, a computational model that can predict and simulate human behaviour in any experiment expressible in natural language. We derived Centaur by fine-tuning a state-of-the-art language model on a large-scale dataset called Psych-101. Psych-101 has an unprecedented scale, covering trial-by-trial data from more than 60,000 participants performing in excess of 10,000,000 choices in 160 experiments. Centaur not only captures the behaviour of held-out participants better than existing cognitive models, but it also generalizes to previously unseen cover stories, structural task modifications and entirely new domains. Furthermore, the model’s internal representations become more aligned with human neural activity after fine-tuning. Taken together, our results demonstrate that it is possible to discover computational models that capture human behaviour across a wide range of domains. We believe that such models provide tremendous potential for guiding the development of cognitive theories, and we present a case study to demonstrate this. A computational model called Centaur, developed by fine-tuning a language model on a huge dataset called Psych-101, can predict and simulate human nature in experiments expressible in natural language, even in previously unseen situations."

 Acute inflammation is an essential response that our bodies use to combat infections1. However, in the absence of infections, chronic inflammation can have a pivotal role in the onset and progression of chronic diseases, such as arthritis, cancer, autoimmune disorders, metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), and most ageing-associated pathologies2,3. The underlying mechanisms that distinguish chronic inflammation from its acute counterpart remain unclear, posing challenges to the development of targeted therapies for these major diseases. Here we identify a mechanism that separates the two responses: during chronic but not acute inflammation, chromatin remodelling is influenced by nuclear autophagy, in which the WSTF protein of the ISWI chromatin-remodelling complex interacts with the ATG8 autophagy protein family in the nucleus. This interaction leads to WSTF nuclear export and subsequent degradation by autophagosomes and lysosomes in the cytoplasm. Loss of WSTF leads to chromatin opening over inflammatory genes, amplifying inflammation. Cell-penetrating peptides that block the WSTF–ATG8 interaction do not affect acute inflammation but suppress chronic inflammation in senescence as well as in MASH and osteoarthritis in mouse models and patient samples. The ability to specifically target chronic inflammation without blunting acute inflammation offers an approach for treating common chronic inflammatory diseases. During chronic but not acute inflammation, chromatin remodelling is influenced by nuclear autophagy through WSTF interaction with ATG8 in the nucleus, leading to WSTF nuclear export and its subsequent degradation."

 Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy is effective against many cancers, although resistance remains a major issue and new strategies are needed to improve clinical outcomes1–5. Here we studied ICB response in a cohort of patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma—a cancer type that poses considerable clinical challenges and lacks effective therapies6–8. We observed significantly prolonged overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with tumours with PPP2R1A mutations. Importantly, our findings were validated in additional ICB-treated patient cohorts across multiple cancer types. Translational analyses from tumour biopsies demonstrated enhanced IFNγ signalling, and the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures at the baseline, as well as enhanced immune infiltration and expansion of CD45RO+CD8+ T cells in the tumour neighbourhood after ICB treatment in PPP2R1A-mutated tumours. Parallel preclinical investigations showed that targeting PPP2R1A (by pharmacological inhibition or genetic modifications) in in vitro and in vivo models was associated with improved survival in the setting of treatment with several forms of immunotherapy, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy and ICB. The results from these studies suggest that therapeutic targeting of PPP2R1A may represent an effective strategy to improve patient outcomes after ICB or other forms of immunotherapy, although additional mechanistic and therapeutic insights are needed.

Mattar,Discovering cognitive strategies with tiny recurrent neural networks,"Modelling biological decision-making with tiny recurrent neural networks enables more accurate predictions of animal choices than classical cognitive models and offers insights into the underlying cognitive strategies and neural mechanisms. 
 Understanding how animals and humans learn from experience to make adaptive decisions is a fundamental goal of neuroscience and psychology. Normative modelling frameworks such as Bayesian inference1 and reinforcement learning2 provide valuable insights into the principles governing adaptive behaviour. However, the simplicity of these frameworks often limits their ability to capture realistic biological behaviour, leading to cycles of handcrafted adjustments that are prone to researcher subjectivity. Here we present a novel modelling approach that leverages recurrent neural networks to discover the cognitive algorithms governing biological decision-making. We show that neural networks with just one to four units often outperform classical cognitive models and match larger neural networks in predicting the choices of individual animals and humans, across six well-studied reward-learning tasks. Critically, we can interpret the trained networks using dynamical systems concepts, enabling a unified comparison of cognitive models and revealing detailed mechanisms underlying choice behaviour. Our approach also estimates the dimensionality of behaviour3 and offers insights into algorithms learned by meta-reinforcement learning artificial intelligence agents. Overall, we present a systematic approach for discovering interpretable cognitive strategies in decision-making, offering insights into neural mechanisms and a foundation for studying healthy and dysfunctional cognition. Modelling biological decision-making with tiny recurrent neural networks enables more accurate predictions of animal choices than classical cognitive models and offers insights into the underlying cognitive strategies and neural mechanisms."

Zhou,Carbonate formation and fluctuating habitability on Mars,"A modelling study suggests that Mars had a desert-like climate with intermittent liquid-water oases regulated by a negative feedback among solar luminosity, liquid water and carbonate formation. 
 The cause of Mars’s loss of surface habitability is unclear, with isotopic data suggesting a ‘missing sink’ of carbonate1. Past climates with surface and shallow-subsurface liquid water are recorded by Mars’s sedimentary rocks, including strata in the approximately 4-km-thick record at Gale Crater2. Those waters were intermittent, spatially patchy and discontinuous, and continued remarkably late in Mars’s history3—attributes that can be understood if, as on Earth, sedimentary-rock formation sequestered carbon dioxide as abundant carbonate (recently confirmed in situ at Gale4). Here we show that a negative feedback among solar luminosity, liquid water and carbonate formation can explain the existence of intermittent Martian oases. In our model, increasing solar luminosity promoted the stability of liquid water, which in turn formed carbonate, reduced the partial pressure of atmospheric carbon dioxide and limited liquid water5. Chaotic orbital forcing modulated wet–dry cycles. The negative feedback restricted liquid water to oases and Mars self-regulated as a desert planet. We model snowmelt as the water source, but the feedback can also work with groundwater as the water source. Model output suggests that Gale faithfully records the expected primary episodes of liquid water stability in the surface and near-surface environment. Eventually, atmospheric thickness approaches water’s triple point, curtailing the sustained stability of liquid water and thus habitability in the surface environment. We assume that the carbonate content found at Gale is representative, and as a result we present a testable idea rather than definitive evidence. A modelling study suggests that Mars had a desert-like climate with intermittent liquid-water oases regulated by a negative feedback among solar luminosity, liquid water and carbonate formation."

 Thermal nanophotonics enables fundamental breakthroughs across technological applications from energy technology to information processing1–11. From thermal emitters to thermophotovoltaics and thermal camouflage, precise spectral engineering has been bottlenecked by trial-and-error approaches. Concurrently, machine learning has demonstrated its powerful capabilities in the design of nanophotonic and meta-materials12–18. However, it remains a considerable challenge to develop a general design methodology for tailoring high-performance nanophotonic emitters with ultrabroadband control and precise band selectivity, as they are constrained by predefined geometries and materials, local optimization traps and traditional algorithms. Here we propose an unconventional machine learning-based paradigm that can design a multitude of ultrabroadband and band-selective thermal meta-emitters by realizing multiparameter optimization with sparse data that encompasses three-dimensional structural complexity and material diversity. Our framework enables dual design capabilities: (1) it automates the inverse design of a vast number of possible metastructure and material combinations for spectral tailoring; (2) it has an unprecedented ability to design various three-dimensional meta-emitters by applying a three-plane modelling method that transcends the limitations of traditional, flat, two-dimensional structures. We present seven proof-of-concept meta-emitters that exhibit superior optical and radiative cooling performance surpassing current state-of-the-art designs. We provide a generalizable framework for fabricating three-dimensional nanophotonic materials, which facilitates global optimization through expanded geometric freedom and dimensionality and a comprehensive materials database.

 AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) mediate the majority of excitatory neurotransmission in the brain1. Assembled from combinations of four core subunits, GluA1-4, and ~20 auxiliary subunits, their molecular diversity tunes information transfer and storage in a brain circuit-specific manner. GluA3, a subtype strongly associated with disease2, functions as both a fast transmitting Ca2+-permeable (CP) AMPAR at sensory synapses3, and as a Ca2+-impermeable (CI) receptor at cortical synapses4,5. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of the CP GluA3 homomer, which substantially diverge from other AMPARs. The GluA3 extracellular domain tiers (NTD and LBD) are closely coupled throughout gating states, creating previously unseen interfaces that impact signalling and harbour human disease mutations. Central to this architecture is a stacking interaction between two arginine residues (Arg163) in the NTD dimer interface, trapping a unique NTD dimer conformation that enables close contacts with the LBD. Rupture of the Arg163 stack not only alters the structure and dynamics of the GluA3 extracellular region, but also increases receptor trafficking, and the expression of GluA3 heteromers at the synapse. We further show that a mammalian-specific GluA3 trafficking checkpoint determines conformational stability of the LBD tier. Hence, specific design features define communication and biogenesis of GluA3, offering a framework to interrogate this disease-prone glutamate receptor."

Electrophysiology and molecular dynamics simulations suggest disruption of this bond is a key component of channel opening during inhibitory synaptic signaling in the brain. 
 GABAA receptors (GABAARs) are the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors throughout the central nervous system. Genetic mutations causing their dysfunction are related to a broad spectrum of human disorders such as epilepsy, neurodevelopment and intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and depression. GABAARs are also important drug targets for anxiolytics, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and anesthetics. Despite significant progress in understanding their three-dimensional structure, a critical gap remains in determining the molecular basis for channel gating. We recently identified mutations in the M2-M3 linkers that suggest linker flexibility has asymmetric subunit-specific correlations with channel opening. Here we use non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) to investigate the role of main-chain H-hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) that may stabilize the M2-M3 linkers. We show that a single main-chain H-bond within the β2 subunit M2-M3 linker inhibits pore opening and is required to keep the unliganded channel closed. Furthermore, breaking this H-bond accounts for approximately one third of the energy used to open the channel during activation by GABA. In contrast, the analogous H-bond in the α1 subunit has no effect on gating. Our molecular simulations support the idea that channel opening involves the state-dependent breakage/disruption of a specific main-chain H-bond within the β2 subunit M2-M3 linker. The authors identify a single main-chain hydrogen bond required to keep GABAA receptors closed in the absence of neurotransmitter.

 Brainstem gliomas (BSG) is a highly malignant central nervous system childhood tumors with 5-year survival rate <10%.

Here we construct diagnostic and prognostic assays of BSG via circulating metabolites based on both cross-sectional study and longitudinal cohort study with 106 BSG patients. We employ nanoparticle enhanced laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry to characterize static and dynamic snapshots of metabolites during BSG radiotherapy. We show that this serological tool reaches the area under the curve of 0.933 for BSG diagnosis in an independent blind test and predicts risk of patients with significant differences (p < 0.05) in prognostic outcomes. We further identify eight distinct temporal patterns of metabolite regulation associated with radiotherapy responses and tracked the metabolic trajectory via dynamic metabolic snapshots throughout radiotherapy process.

This study shows the potential of systematic ex post evaluations to enhance the credibility of voluntary carbon market schemes. 
 A key factor undermining the credibility of carbon offsets is the evaluation of project baselines and their impact. The ex ante scenarios constructed by project developers in accordance with rules set by certification schemes have been challenged by ex post evaluations from scientists, who frequently document cases of credit allocations that overestimate the actual emission reductions. Increasing credibility requires methodologies that reliably measure project outcomes and prevent overcrediting—an objective that ex post evaluations may be well suited to achieve. We explore how systematic ex post evaluations could restore credibility to certification schemes in the voluntary carbon market.

We investigated AMR and AMR gene abundance of 668 Escherichia coli, Klebsiella and DNA isolated from 877 faecal samples using diffusion disc-method and qPCR, respectively. Pigs in semi-intensive systems were 2.2 times more likely to exhibit AMR and had higher ermB levels. AMR in free-range farmers was twice that of pigs but still 1.4 times less likely than in semi-intensive systems. AMR prevalence increased by 0.76% per month. Potential transmission events were more likely on semi-intensive farms (OR = 3.16, 95% CI: 2.1–4.3, P < 0.001), especially when farmers had higher tetQ levels than pigs; the reverse was true for ermB.

 Oceanic arc and back-arc magmas are typically sourced from mantle metasomatized by subducted slab fluids/melts, but the role of the overriding plate is often ignored. Here we report the oxygen isotopic compositions of olivines in basalts erupted during arc, arc rifting, and back-arc spreading stages in the Mariana convergent margin. Rifting-stage olivines have high Forsterite (Fo = 85–90) and mantle-like δ18O (4.92 to 5.69‰). The δ18O values of olivines in arc and back-arc basin lavas correlate with their Fo values; high-Fo (>83) olivines have mantle-like δ18O while those in low-Fo olivines are as low as 3.87 ± 0.30‰. This indicates that fractionating magmas assimilated low-δ18O oceanic crust in the hydrothermally-altered upper plate, rather than the injections of underlying subducted slab-derived melts. Considering the globally widespread distribution of low-δ18O evolved olivine, we propose that low-δ18O wall rock may be common in the shallow lithosphere and serves as an important contributor to erupted evolved magma.

 Understanding crop migration to adapt to climate change is important to achieve food security and sustainable agriculture. Previous researches mainly focus on the impacts of climate change on crop yields and migration, but environmental feedback has been overlooked. Here we analyze the rice migration and its impact on water use in Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China—which experienced considerable poleward expansion and climate warming. From 2000 to 2020, rice cultivation expanded northeast by 2.19 million hectares, increasing irrigation demand by 6.36 billion tonnes. Rice expansion contributed 122.18% to the abrupt irrigation increase, while the direct impact of climate change resulted in a −22.18% increase due to decreased evapotranspiration and increased precipitation. Such phenomenal rice expansion is considerably associated with the decline of groundwater levels by an average of 4.79 meters. Our findings highlight the urgent need to make integrated strategies balancing crop migration to climate change and water resource conservation.

 The Turkey-Syria earthquake, which struck in February 2023, was the worst earthquake the region had suffered in the last two decades. The post-earthquake reconstruction process remains underway, with local communities continuing to grapple with challenges. In this study, four cities in Turkey (i.e., Antakya, Kirikhan, Samandag, and Nurdagi) were investigated to track the post-disaster recovery process. We employed the power recovery percentage metric, derived from glimmer imagery acquired by the Sustainable Development Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1), which records nighttime light (NTL), to track the spatial-temporal dynamics of power restoration over the year following the earthquake. Clustering on time series NTL data was then utilized to identify pixel-scale recovery patterns. Furthermore, urban morphological variables were measured to explore their relationship with urban recovery at the block level. Our findings reveal three diverse dynamic patterns, characterized by ascending, descending, and stable NTL change trajectories. Notably, grids exhibiting rising NTL trends align closely with post-disaster reconstruction efforts (e.g., newly-built accommodation areas). In addition, blocks with low-density buildings, abundant open spaces, and uniform layouts demonstrate greater resilience and faster recovery pace. Overall, this study highlights that the SDGSAT-1 NTL data is powerful in capturing heterogeneous urban recovery processes following the disaster, thereby showing its contribution to advancing Sustainable Development Goal 11."

 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. Understanding urban agglomerations, as highly developed products of urbanization, is important for achieving SDG 11. The Sustainable Development Science Satellite (SDGSAT-1), launched in 2021, aims to characterize “human activity traces” at a fine scale to fill data gaps and address incomplete methods in the implementation of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The satellite, with a 10 m glimmer imager, provides a new and valuable data source for research related to urban agglomerations. To better describe the degree of construction and development of urban agglomerations, we established two new indicators—the City Activity Index (CAI) and the Population Activity Index (PAI)—based on SDGSAT-1 glimmer imager data. Additionally, we proposed a novel method for extracting the strength of intercity connections using 10 m glimmer imager data to reflect the current status of city linkages. These methods were combined and applied in three urban agglomerations in China: Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). The findings not only enhance our understanding of spatial patterns and resource flows within major Chinese urban agglomerations, but also provide actionable data support for urban planning, infrastructure development, and governance.

 Urban functional zones (UFZ) are areas that divide urban space into specific uses based on the distribution of different human activities and infrastructure. UFZ mapping is to analyze the geographic information data of urban space, combine remote sensing images (RSI), point of interest (POI) data and other data sources, and use advanced spatial analysis technology to divide and visualize the UFZ. The intelligent interpretation of UFZ can provide support for urban management and planning. Previous studies on UFZ mainly focused on using remote sensing images and POI data, which can obtain the city’s macroscopic remote sensing visual features and the distribution of land use. However, these methods often ignore the inner-street details due to the absence of using inner-street perspective data and cannot capture the complex spatial relations between objects in complex urban scenes, resulting in unsatisfied UFZ results. For this purpose, we propose a unified multimodal learning method to interpret UFZ by combining remote sensing images, POI data, and street view data with inner-street details to provide a more comprehensive perspective to boost UFZ interpretation. To make full use of the inner-street perspective advantage of street view images (SVI), we not only use their visual features but also extract textual features that can reflect various human activities in street views through image captioning technology, better to capture the subtle socio-economic activity information in urban space. We conduct extensive experiments in Wuhan, Changsha, and Nanchang. The OA of this method on the test set reached 91.80%.

We identified hydrological stress, soil properties, and topography as key drivers of plant functional trait distribution and variation. Further, hydrological stress and soil properties were key determinants of functional diversity and redundancy across a large latitudinal gradient. Functional diversity peaked across Mediterranean forests, occupying between 30°S to 35°S. Functional diversity and redundancy were both high at latitudes between 35°S and 42°S, coinciding with Valdivian rainforests. Conversely, functional redundancy peaked between 42°S and 48°S, corresponding to Austral forests. Towards the southernmost extent of the study area, functional diversity and redundancy were both low between 48°S and 53°S, corresponding to the Magellanic subpolar forests. Our results highlight areas in South American temperate forests where both plant functional diversity and redundancy were maximal, hence potentially pointing towards areas more resilient to environmental change."

 Ultrafine particle (UFP) emissions from aircraft engines are associated with increased UFP concentrations near airports, raising concerns for air quality and public health. This study investigated the impact of airport operations at Brussels Airport (Belgium) on local air quality during a two-month monitoring campaign in autumn 2015. Four monitoring sites, strategically located from the airport and along a transect parallel to the main runway, were used to measure particle number size distributions (PNSD), black carbon (BC), particulate matter (PM10), and nitrogen oxides (NOx). This novel approach, using high-resolution PNSD data, provided a detailed analysis of aircraft-related UFPs under varying meteorological conditions and operational phases. Results showed strong correlations between UFP concentrations, meteorological conditions, and aircraft landing and takeoff (LTO) operations, with the smallest measured particles (10–20 nm) dominating the particle number concentrations (PNC) near the airport, contributing up to 65 % of total PNC. Aircraft emissions were responsible for 15000–20000 # cm−3 of 10–20 nm particles near the airport, with peak concentrations (30-min) reaching 65000–80000 # cm−3 during high-activity periods. While airport-related UFP concentrations decreased with distance, they persisted up to 7 km. Source apportionment analysis identified taxiing and takeoff as major contributors to UFPs near the airport (50–64 % of PNC), with road traffic, biomass burning, and regional background more significant at greater distances. Despite attempts to distinguish between landing and takeoff emissions, similar particle profiles were observed for both operations. These findings provide insight into the spatial persistence, dominant operational phases, and size distribution of aircraft-related UFP emissions, and underscore the need for targeted mitigation strategies to improve air quality near airports."

Our study sheds light on the paradigm of the existence of dual energy cascades in astrophysical plasmas, identifying the scales at which energy sources act in the magnetohydrodynamic regime driving turbulent dynamics in solar wind. These findings suggest that a significant fraction of the energy injected into stellar winds at scales much smaller than those of galaxies could be transferred to larger scales through turbulence, potentially influencing star formation processes."

In this study, we used a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)–induced chorioamnionitis model in pregnant nonhuman primates to explore the therapeutic potential and mode of action of srIκB-loaded exosomes (Exo-srIκBs). Intraamniotic injection of LPS induced infiltration of BCL2A1-positive neutrophils and CD68-positive macrophages in the extraplacental membranes, causing fetal lung injury.

By chronic microendoscopy, we observed robust yet adaptable representations of pup-directed anticipatory and motor-related activities within the OFC. Some of these plastic responses were significantly overlapped with those related to nonsocial reward signals. The inactivation of OFC output reduced the phasic activities of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons specifically tied to pup retrieval and impaired the modulation of DA release to the ventral striatum during the acquisition of alloparental behaviors.

Nonetheless, their structure and function can be recapitulated in diverse amphiphilic assemblies whose compositions deviate from native membranes. It remains unclear how various hydrophobic environments stabilize membrane proteins and whether lipids play any unique role in protein stability compared to other types of amphiphiles. Here, using the evolutionarily unrelated α-helical and β-barrel membrane proteins fromEscherichia coli, we find that the hydrophobic thickness and the strength of amphiphile-amphiphile packing in amphiphilic assemblies are critical determinants of protein stability. Lipid solvation enhances protein stability by facilitating residue burial in the protein interior, reminiscent of the lipophobic effect. This lipid-mediated mechanism also strengthens the cooperative residue-interaction network, promoting the propagation of local structural perturbations throughout the protein. This study demonstrates the pivotal role of lipid solvation in modulating the stability of membrane proteins and their responses to external stimuli."

Through idealized SST experiments, we found that warming in tropical and mid-latitude oceans raises polar temperatures through enhanced atmospheric energy transport, leading to surface warming and top-of-atmosphere cooling in polar areas. This study highlights the distinct impacts of tropical Pacific and Indian Ocean SST changes on Arctic and Antarctic climates. 
 Surface temperature at polar regions not only is affected by local forcings and feedbacks but also depends on teleconnections between polar regions and low-latitude regions. In this study, the responses of the energy budget in polar regions to remote sea surface temperature (SST) changes are analyzed using a set of idealized regional SST perturbation experiments. The results show that the responses of the polar energy budget to remote sea surface warmings are regulated by changes in atmospheric energy transport, and radiative feedbacks also contribute to the polar energy budget at both the top of atmosphere (TOA) and the surface. Specifically, an increase in poleward atmospheric energy transport to polar regions results in an increase in surface and air temperature, and the corresponding Planck feedback leads to radiative warming at the surface and radiative cooling at the TOA. In response to sea surface warmings in most mid-latitude regions, poleward atmospheric energy transport to polar regions in the corresponding hemisphere increases. Sea surface warming over most tropical regions enhances the polar energy transport to both Arctic and Antarctic regions, except that an increase in the Indian Ocean's temperature results in a decrease in poleward atmospheric energy transport to the Arctic due to the different responses of stationary waves. The sensitivity of the Arctic energy budget to tropical SST changes is generally stronger than that of the Antarctic energy budget, and poleward atmospheric heat transport is dominated by dry static energy, with a lesser contribution from latent heat transport.

To our knowledge, the resolution and length of this dataset are enough to detect the asymmetry, vertical tilt, and temporal evolution of mesoscale eddies (MEs) and the corresponding submesoscale processes. The dataset is expected to improve the accuracy of current and biogeochemistry numerical models. More projects conducting AUV experiments will be promoted in the future. 
 Marginal seas are often characterized by dynamic mesoscale eddies (MEs), whose evolution plays a critical role in regulating global oceanic energy budgets, triggering submesoscale processes with strong vertical velocity, and facilitating biogeochemical transport. However, traditional observation methods, constrained by passive sampling modes, struggle to resolve the temporal evolution of MEs and associated submesoscale processes at kilometer-scale resolutions. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and underwater gliders (UGs), operating in active sampling modes, provide spatio-temporal synchronized measurements of these highly dynamic features. Here, we present a 9-year (2014–2022) high-resolution temperature–salinity dataset collected by AUVs/UGs in the South China Sea (SCS), accessible via https://doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.11996 (Qiu et al., 2024b). In total, the dataset comprises 11 cruise experiments that deployed 50 UGs and two AUVs, achieving spatial and temporal resolutions of < 7 km and < 7 h, respectively. This dataset offers unprecedented insights into ME evolution life stages, covering the zones of an eddy's birth, propagation, and dissipation. A total of 40 % of the data resolve submesoscale processes (< 1 km, < 4 h), capturing dynamic instabilities along and across frontal zones at eddy peripheries. This dataset has the potential to improve the forecast accuracy in physical and biogeochemistry numerical models. Much more aggressive field investigation programs will be promoted by the National Natural Science Foundation of China in the future."

We conducted a field survey of residential, commercial, and industrial buildings affected by the record-breaking flood event that hit Italy’s Marche region in 2022. The resulting datasets cover 256 assets and include detailed information on damage, building features, and mitigation measures. 
 Accurate flood damage data are essential for developing reliable flood risk assessments and designing effective risk management strategies. However, empirical flood damage data remain limited, particularly at the object level, hindering the calibration and validation of predictive models. Existing datasets are often highly aggregated and lack the granularity required for detailed analysis. This paper presents two comprehensive, micro-scale datasets documenting flood damage to 256 buildings, comprising both residential buildings and economic activities, surveyed in the aftermath of the 2022 flood event in the Marche region of Italy. The georeferenced datasets include information on hazard characteristics, buildings’ vulnerability features, physical damage description across structural and non-structural components, indirect damage, and implemented mitigation measures. In addition, original survey forms are provided to support future data collections in different contexts. Datasets and survey forms are available at the link: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15591850.

Flowers;Matthew J. Hoffman,Computationally efficient subglacial drainage modelling using Gaussian process emulators: GlaDS-GP v1.0,"Subglacial drainage models represent water flow beneath glaciers and ice sheets. Here, we train fast statistical models called Gaussian process (GP) emulators to accelerate subglacial drainage modelling by ~ 1000 times. We use the fast emulator predictions to show that three of the model parameters are responsible for > 90 % of the variance in model outputs. The fast GP emulators will enable future uncertainty quantification and calibration of these models. 
 Subglacial drainage models represent water flow at the ice–bed interface through coupled distributed and channelized systems to determine water pressure, discharge, and drainage system geometry. While they are used to understand processes such as the relationship between surface melt and ice flow, the number of uncertain model parameters and the computational cost of running models makes it difficult to adequately explore the high-dimensional parameter space and evaluate uncertainty in model predictions. Here, we develop Gaussian process (GP) emulators that make fast predictions with associated uncertainty of subglacial drainage model outputs. Using a truncated principal component (PC) basis representation, we construct a GP emulator for diurnally averaged subglacial water pressure. We also explore emulation of scalar variables describing drainage efficiency and configuration. We train the emulators using ensembles of up to 512 simulations varying eight parameters of the Glacier Drainage System (GlaDS) model on a synthetic domain intended to represent an ice-sheet margin. The emulators make predictions ∼ 1000 times faster than GlaDS simulations, with errors <3 % for the water pressure field and ∼ 5 %–9 % for drainage efficiency and configuration. We apply the emulators to explore the eight-dimensional parameter space by computing variance-based parameter sensitivity indices, finding that three parameters (ice flow coefficient, bed bump aspect ratio, and the subglacial cavity system conductivity) explain 90 % of the variance in modelled water pressure in response to parameter changes. The GP emulator approach described here is well suited to integrating observational data with models to make calibrated, credible predictions of subglacial drainage."

This study first reveals the coupling coordination mechanisms between carbon efficiency and carbon equity based on Chinese provincial data from 2012 to 2017. We demonstrated that the carbon efficiency and carbon equity exhibited a strong coupling coordination relation (CCR). Carbon efficiency significantly promoted carbon equity and was a major driver of the CCR. With every 1 unit increase in carbon efficiency, carbon equity and the CCR increased by 3.766 to 5.694 units and approximately 1-2 units, respectively, and the positive impact of carbon efficiency on the CCR was approximately 6 to 8 times that of carbon equity. Carbon efficiency, carbon equity, and the CCR worsened between 2012 and 2017, and the bottom 50% of them were mainly concentrated in central and western provinces with abundant natural resources and net inflow of embodied carbon emission. Additionally, we demonstrated that resource dependence hindered carbon efficiency, carbon equity, and the CCR, and the potential transmission pathways were the crowding-out effect on the technology innovation, digital informatization, and advancement of industrial structure."

However, quality measures are equally important, as they directly influence health behaviors. We leveraged computer vision and street-view imagery to estimate five components of built environment quality (perceived beauty, relaxation potential, nature quality, safe for walking, and safety from crime) across all U.S. cities, explicitly addressing socio-demographic and temporal biases. We collected 72 516 surveys via Amazon Mechanical Turk, where participants ranked street-view images and provided socio-demographic data. Deep learning models predicted quality metrics at 120 million street locations for 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020. Cross-validation accuracy ranged from 73% (nature quality) to 59% (safety from crime) compared to 50% expected by random chance. Adjusting sampling weights based on demographics reduced but did not eliminate biases for Hispanic/Latino and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander groups (3.5 and 4% lower accuracy, respectively). We also adjusted model predictions for seasonal biases, correcting higher scores from late spring and early summer imagery (p < 0.001).

However, studies employing multicomponent systems remain limited. This study investigates the role of minerals in •OH photochemical generation in the presence of organic compounds with distinct functional groups. Using model compounds to represent key moieties in dissolved organic matter (DOM), we examined the capacity of both single-component systems (organic matter and minerals) and composite systems (ferrihydrite-organic matter) to generate •OH. Our findings demonstrate that low-molecular-weight organics such as oxalate and citrate, rich in carboxyl groups, significantly enhance •OH production when combined with ferrihydrite. In contrast, organic molecules with aromatic or quinone-like structures (e.g., Aldrich humic acid (AHA) and 9,10-anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonic acid disodium salt (AQDS)) tend to suppress •OH production. Specifically, the ferrihydrite-citrate system shows a doubling of •OH production under solar light and a 20-fold increase under visible light at pH 3. Conversely, the addition of ferrihydrite significantly inhibited •OH production in the AQDS system, which by itself had a strong ability to generate •OH. Furthermore, mineral transformation and organic carbon loss suggest that •OH photochemical generation could accelerate the geochemical cycling of iron and carbon. These insights deepen our understanding of the mechanisms underlying •OH generation and the environmental implications of iron–carbon interactions at the irradiated interfaces."

Therefore, this study employed incubation experiments using HA-treated soil columns under continuous flooding (CF) and alternating wet–dry (AWD) to explore the relationship between CH4 production and CO2 fixation. The results demonstrate that HA significantly increased CH4 emissions, with a 102.87% rise under CF conditions and a 135.13% increase under AWD. In contrast, CO2 emissions remained unaffected under both conditions. Key microbial groups, such as Methanosarcina, were enriched by HA, with a 15.01% increase in methanogen abundance under CF and a 6.36% increase under AWD. Additionally, the upregulation of key intermediates, such as acetyl-CoA and tetrahydrofolate, was significantly higher in HA treatments. A Mantel test demonstrated the coupling between carbon fixation and methanogenesis pathways. In conclusion, HA promoted the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway in Methanobacterium for CO2 conversion into acetyl-CoA and facilitated acetoclastic methanogenesis in Methanothrix through acetate utilization. These findings advocate prioritizing AWD-HA integration in water-secure regions to balance soil carbon retention and emission reduction.

Previous reviews mainly emphasized ROS toxicity and Fenton chemistry-related reactions, neglecting a comprehensive understanding of ROS distribution and hotspots, formation mechanisms, and ecological effects. Here, the most advanced in situ and ex situ detection methods of ROS in soil and sediment are first summarized to address these gaps. ROS hotspots are identified as active microinterfaces and oxic–anoxic fluctuation zones by graphing the distribution of ROS in soil and sediment. Second, ROS formation processes and mechanisms are outlined, which involve natural organic matter (NOM) and biochar (acting as electron shuttle, geobattery, geoconductor, and photosensitizer), transition metals (mainly via Fenton and Fenton-like reactions), and microbes (producing extracellular ROS and mediating NOM decomposition or metal oxides reduction). Further, as for the ecological effects of ROS, they impact the microbial community, nutrient cycle, and the transformation of organic pollutants and multivalence heavy metals. Finally, we call for more future research that focuses on developing rapid and in situ ROS detection techniques, elucidating the interactive ROS formation mechanisms by trace environmental components, analyzing ecological consequences in ROS hotspots, and practically applying ROS in soil and sediment. A comprehensive understanding of the ROS formation process in soil and sediment is crucial for the study of soil carbon sequestration and natural remediation processes in the context of global green and low-carbon development."

The relative abundances of doubly substituted (“clumped”) methane isotopologues (13CH3D and 12CH2D2) offer important information on the sources and sinks of methane. However, the clumped isotope signatures of microbially produced methane from different methanogenic pathways lack a systematic investigation. In this study, we provide a data set encompassing isotopic signatures of hydrogenotrophic, methylotrophic, acetoclastic, and methoxydotrophic methanogenesis. We find that a statistical “combinatorial effect” generates significant differences in 12CH2D2 compositions between hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and the other pathways, while variations in the fractionation factors of clumped isotopologues result in differences in 13CH3D compositions between the methylotrophic, acetoclastic, and methoxydotrophic pathways. The energy yield of methanogenesis and the energy conservation approaches implemented by different microbial strains may also influence the isotope values of methane. Further analysis suggests that previously observed isotopic signatures of methane in freshwater environments are potentially due to mixing between hydrogenotrophic and other methanogenesis pathways. This study provides new experimental constraints on the isotope signatures of different microbial methanogenic pathways and evidence of the mechanisms responsible for the observed differences. This enables a better understanding of the sources and sinks of methane in the environment."

However, soil DOM is heterogeneous with varying molecular weights (MW), and how the dynamic interplay between DOM molecules and Fe oxides affects the sequestration of different OC species remains elusive. In this study, we separated DOM into <3, 3–10, and >10 kDa fractions by ultrafiltration to investigate the dynamic distribution of OC species at the molecular level and subnanoscale during ferrihydrite-OC coprecipitate transformation. Compared with the low MW DOM fraction, the higher MW DOM fractions inhibited Fe oxide transformation less, but showed stronger sequestration ability on Fe oxides, due to more aromatic compounds with higher carboxyl number per molecule. Despite the above difference, the released DOM during mineral transformation was similar to mainly nonaromatic compositions. At the nano to subnanoscales, aromatic-rich compounds were sequestered within the defective/porous structure of Fe oxides, whereas high crystalline Fe oxides promoted the sequestration of carboxyl-rich compounds. Our study provides novel insights into the sequestration mechanisms of different OC species during Fe oxide transformation and highlights the significance of incorporating MW-dependent DOM compositions when predicting SOC stability."

Herein, electronic density-dependent catalysts based on FeOCl with externally coordinated moieties were fabricated to fulfill the switching of the catalytic oxidation mechanism in peroxymonosulfate (PMS)-based Fenton-like reactions. The experimental results indicate that the catalytic activity and reaction mechanism vary with the changes in electronic density around the Fe site, which determines the contributions of radical and nonradical mechanisms, thus achieving selective or nonselective oxidation. Theoretical simulations indicate that Fe sites with sufficient electronic density are inclined to adsorb the O sites of the O–O bond followed by subsequent electron transfer and radical generation. Conversely, Fe sites with a deficient electronic density tend to adsorb the terminal O of PMS, facilitating the oxidation of PMS to form sulfate radical anions, which then convert to singlet oxygen. The sustained activity of loaded catalysts during the 10 h continuous operation of the scaled-up experiment demonstrated their potential for practical application. This work brings an in-depth insight into the catalytic mechanism of the Fenton-like reaction and guides the electronic engineering of catalysts to meet the specific demands of various experimental scenarios."

However, time-resolved stream 6PPD-Q concentration data remain scarce. We measured rainfall, discharge, and 6PPD-Q concentrations in an urban salmon-bearing stream over four rain events to capture the antecedent dry weather (baseflow) and the increased streamflow (stormflow). Portable autosamplers proved to be effective for continual water sampling. The resulting time series revealed 6PPD-Q flushing during stormflow, likely influenced by surface runoff from roads upstream. Following the initial rise in stream stage (+5% depth), mean 24 h time-averaged 6PPD-Q concentration was 45.0 ng/L, 25-fold higher than baseflow, and the mean 24 h load was 3.73 g, 220-fold higher than the preceding 24-h period. Measured 6PPD-Q concentrations, which peaked at 237.0 ng/L, exceeded the LC50 reported for juvenile coho salmon for periods ranging from 3.5 to 18.7 h during rain events, but never during the preceding dry period. Accordingly, coho salmon habitat can be subjected to repeated pulses of 6PPD-Q over the course of the wet season during elevated streamflow periods, which may expose spawning adults, juveniles, and hatching fry to toxic concentrations for considerable periods."

The emerging issue of salt contamination of water supplies in tidal rivers and its diverse impacts highlight the critical need for interdisciplinary research that must integrate knowledge from oceanography, hydrology, and water resource management. Here we elucidate oceanic and hydrological processes regulating saltwater intrusion into estuaries and tidal rivers as well as watershed processes driving enhanced chemical weathering and export of watershed salts into rivers. By synthesizing studies around the world, we discuss how sea-level rise, prolonged drought, and increasingly extreme weather events in a changing climate are driving more frequent saltwater intrusion events that threaten water security globally. We propose a convergent research agenda toward the development of a decision support tool for salinity management.

Yet, mechanisms governing the Atlantic warming, particularly the role of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), remain uncertain. Through ocean‐only and coupled model experiments, we confirm the key role of the weakened AMOC in the enhanced Atlantic heat storage. Physically, the reduced poleward heat transport of AMOC causes an additional heat pile‐up in the 15°S–45°N regions with a lag time of ∼10 years. Based on this dynamical linkage, we propose that the regional enhanced heat storage in the 15°S–45°N Atlantic relative to the global average serves as a fingerprint for the long‐term AMOC change. The observed heat storage indicates an overall AMOC slowdown by only 1.31 ± 0.39 Sv since the 1950s.

Approaches for determining a subset of global climate models to use often focus on values from the raw models, rather than from their downscaled counterparts, in other words assuming that the statistical distribution of the multi‐model ensemble does not change post downscaling. This study demonstrates that a downscaled ensemble will typically retain the change distribution as a raw ensemble, but individual models can differ dramatically post‐downscaling.

On 23–24 May 2020, an isolated supercell formed ahead of a squall line and subsequently evolved into a bow echo through their merger. Utilizing a 10‐min update four‐dimensional variational data assimilation system that integrates radar and surface observations, we investigated the convective‐scale processes that led to the formation of this bow echo. Our findings indicated that as the squall line advanced eastward, its inflow was initially obstructed by the supercell, causing the weakening of both the squall line and its associated cold pool. However, during the merger, a strong rear inflow jet (RIJ) rapidly developed ahead of the squall line's leading edge and behind the supercell. Unlike a classic RIJ that typically expands rearward over the cold pool, this RIJ accelerated forward toward the supercell. Diagnostic pressure analysis revealed that the RIJ was primarily driven by the developing mesolow embedded within the supercell. Additionally, the supercell's strengthening prior to bowing generated a deep‐tropospheric gravity wave downdraft, which amplified the RIJ by enhancing near‐surface westerlies. Despite the weakening of the squall line's cold pool, it still contributed to the RIJ formation by providing negative horizontal vorticity at its leading edge and facilitating the RIJ's descent. Consequently, the intense RIJ and the subsequent replacement of the supercell against the initial leading edge led to the formation of a severe bow echo, producing a broad swath of damaging winds."

This pristine convection occurred ahead of an eastward‐propagating squall line, despite the absence of discernible surface convergence, and later evolved into a supercell that eventually merged with the approaching squall line. The atmospheric environment, which featured a low‐level inversion layer with considerable convective inhibition, was generally unfavorable for surface‐based convective initiation (CI). However, our analysis indicated that the spatial heterogeneous nocturnal southerly low‐level jet (LLJ) played a key role in the elevated CI. As the LLJ advected moisture and warm air, neighboring regions experienced substantial low‐level destabilization. Multiple convergence bands associated with the heterogeneous LLJ were identified, and the timing and location of CI were governed by these bands. CI occurred when one of the convergence bands moved northward to a position beneath a divergence band at the entrance of the mid‐tropospheric jet. This overlapping pattern of convergence‐divergence persisted for over an hour, facilitating both the initiation and development of the supercell. Additionally, we observed two other episodes of CI ahead of the squall line, each with different characteristics. The first, occurring earlier than the supercell initiation, was triggered by topographic convergence in a valley but quickly dissipated. Later, as the LLJ rotated clockwise, the most prominent convergence band shifted eastward, favoring the continuous development of forward‐building cells ahead of the squall line, resulting in a T‐shaped system."

 Barrier tissues isolate organisms from their surrounding environment. Maintaining the integrity of the tissues is essential for this function. In many seed plants, periderm forms as the outer barrier during secondary growth to prevent water loss and pathogen infection1. The periderm is regenerated when its integrity is lost following injury; however, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown, despite its importance for plant survival. Here we report that periderm integrity in Arabidopsis roots is sensed by diffusion of the gases ethylene and oxygen. Following injury of the periderm, ethylene leaks out through the wound and oxygen enters, resulting in attenuation of ethylene signalling and hypoxia signalling. This condition promotes periderm regeneration in the root. When regeneration is complete and barrier integrity is re-established, pre-injury levels of ethylene and hypoxia signalling are regained. Gas diffusion monitoring is also used to re-establish the barrier in inflorescence stems after the epidermis is injured. We thus propose that gas diffusion is used by plants as a general principle to monitor and re-establish barrier integrity. A study using Arabidopsis shows that plants can monitor the integrity of their outer barriers by sensing gas diffusion, enabling them to initiate wound repair to prevent water loss and pathogen entry."

However, such atlases are unavailable5. Here we present a whole mouse brain dataset of Nissl-based cytoarchitecture with isotropic 1-μm resolution, achieved through continuous micro-optical sectioning tomography.

We developed an informatics-based platform for visualizing and sharing of the atlas images, offering services such as brain slice registration, neuronal circuit mapping and intelligent stereotaxic surgery planning. This atlas is interoperable with widely used stereotaxic atlases, supporting cross-atlas navigation of corresponding coronal planes in two dimensions and spatial mapping across atlas spaces in three dimensions.

 Ancient Egyptian society flourished for millennia, reaching its peak during the Dynastic Period (approximately 3150–30 bce). However, owing to poor DNA preservation, questions about regional interconnectivity over time have not been addressed because whole-genome sequencing has not yet been possible. Here we sequenced a 2× coverage whole genome from an adult male Egyptian excavated at Nuwayrat (Nuerat, نويرات). Radiocarbon dated to 2855–2570 cal. bce, he lived a few centuries after Egyptian unification, bridging the Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom periods. The body was interred in a ceramic pot within a rock-cut tomb1, potentially contributing to the DNA preservation. Most of his genome is best represented by North African Neolithic ancestry, among available sources at present. Yet approximately 20% of his genetic ancestry can be traced to genomes representing the eastern Fertile Crescent, including Mesopotamia and surrounding regions. This genetic affinity is similar to the ancestry appearing in Anatolia and the Levant during the Neolithic and Bronze Age2–5. Although more genomes are needed to fully understand the genomic diversity of early Egyptians, our results indicate that contacts between Egypt and the eastern Fertile Crescent were not limited to objects and imagery (such as domesticated animals and plants, as well as writing systems)6–9 but also encompassed human migration.

 Lung cancer in never smokers (LCINS) accounts for around 25% of all lung cancers1,2 and has been associated with exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke and air pollution in observational studies3–5. Here we use data from the Sherlock-Lung study to evaluate mutagenic exposures in LCINS by examining the cancer genomes of 871 treatment-naive individuals with lung cancer who had never smoked, from 28 geographical locations. KRAS mutations were 3.8 times more common in adenocarcinomas of never smokers from North America and Europe than in those from East Asia, whereas a higher prevalence of EGFR and TP53 mutations was observed in adenocarcinomas of never smokers from East Asia. Signature SBS40a, with unknown cause6, contributed the largest proportion of single base substitutions in adenocarcinomas, and was enriched in cases with EGFR mutations. Signature SBS22a, which is associated with exposure to aristolochic acid7,8, was observed almost exclusively in patients from Taiwan. Exposure to secondhand smoke was not associated with individual driver mutations or mutational signatures. By contrast, patients from regions with high levels of air pollution were more likely to have TP53 mutations and shorter telomeres. They also exhibited an increase in most types of mutations, including a 3.9-fold increase in signature SBS4, which has previously been linked with tobacco smoking9, and a 76% increase in the clock-like10 signature SBS5. A positive dose–response effect was observed with air-pollution levels, correlating with both a decrease in telomere length and an increase in somatic mutations, mainly attributed to signatures SBS4 and SBS5. Our results elucidate the diversity of mutational processes shaping the genomic landscape of lung cancer in never smokers.

 The elemental stoichiometry of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) regulates marine biogeochemical cycles and underpins the Redfield ratio paradigm. However, its global variability and response to environmental change remain poorly constrained. Here we compile a global dataset of 56,031 plankton (particulate) and 388,515 seawater (dissolved) samples from 1971 to 2020, spanning surface to 1,000 m depth, to assess spatial and temporal dynamics in marine C:N:P ratios. We show that planktonic C:P and N:P, and oceanic C:N and C:P ratios, consistently exceed Redfield ratio throughout the study period, indicating widespread deviation from canonical stoichiometry. Planktonic C:N and N:P ratios rose markedly in the late twentieth century, followed by a decline, suggesting a progressive alleviation of P limitation, probably driven by increased anthropogenic P inputs. Depth-resolved patterns show decreasing oceanic C:N and C:P, and increasing N:P ratios with depth, attributable to differential remineralization and microbial nutrient cycling. Our findings highlight dynamic, non-static stoichiometric patterns over decadal scales, offering critical observational constraints for refining the representation of elemental cycling in biogeochemical models and improving projections of marine ecosystem responses to global change.

Here, the authors show that claudin-5 present in non-thermogenic adipocytes regulates thermogenesis and energy expenditure by modulating IL-10 secretion. 
 The claudin protein family plays key roles in maintaining normal structure and function of epithelial and endothelial tight junctions. While several prior studies have addressed the expression of claudin in adipocytes that do not form tight junctions, here we demonstrate that CLDN5 is selectively expressed in non-thermogenic adipocytes within adipose tissue. Ablation of CLDN5 in adipocyte impairs thermogenesis and energy expenditure. CLDN5 deficiency also significantly increases diet-induced fat mass in mice, accompanied with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Mechanistically, CLDN5 affects the subcellular localization of Y-box protein 3, which directly regulates IL10 expression via binding to its promoter and specific sites in 3′-untranslated region, thereby acts in a paracrine manner to signal through IL10R in neighbouring thermogenic adipocytes. These findings expand our understanding about location and function of the extra-tight junction claudin proteins and provide molecular insights into signaling mechanisms underlying adipose thermogenesis that could inform future therapy. Claudin proteins maintain epithelial and endothelial tight junctions, but their functions in adipocytes lacking such junctions remain unclear.

 The interplay between superconductivity and charge or spin order is a key focus in condensed matter physics, with kagome lattice systems providing unique insights. The kagome superconductor LaRu3Si2 (Tc ≃ 6.5 K) features a characteristic kagome band structure and a hierarchy of charge order transitions at Tco,I ≃ 400 K and Tco,II ≃ 80 K, along with an additional transition at T* ≃ 35 K associated with electronic and magnetic responses. Using magnetotransport under pressure up to 40 GPa, we find Tc peaks at 9 K (2 GPa)—the highest among kagome superconductors—remains nearly constant up to 12 GPa, and then decreases to 2 K at 40 GPa, forming a dome-shaped phase diagram. Similarly, both the resistivity anomaly at T* and the magnetoresistance exhibit a dome-shaped pressure dependence. Moreover, above 12 GPa, X-ray diffraction reveals that the charge order evolves from long-range to short-range, coinciding with the suppression of Tc. These observations indicate that superconductivity in LaRu3Si2 is closely linked to the charge-ordered state and the electronic responses at Tco,II and T*.

 A comprehensive understanding of material strength across strain rates typically requires the combination of results from different methods, which often vary in loading conditions and/or sampled volumes, leading to discrepancies in material behavior.

 We performed the first in-depth, comparative and prospective biomonitoring of Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients (N = 39) receiving ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel) or idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel) chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR T) in the real-world setting. In cilta-cel patients response rates were higher and atypical neurotoxicities/infections more frequent. Peak CAR T counts were significantly higher in cilta-cel patients, driven by CD4+ CAR expansion, correlating with clinical responses. Expansion of cilta-cel cells was associated with higher CAR and CD27 expression while, in contrast to ide-cel, there was no correlation between TIM3 expression and CAR T proliferation. Cilta-cel CAR T expansion was followed by a CAR-specific switch from proliferation-associated genes to genes/surface markers indicating effector/memory function. The longer persistence of cilta-cel CAR T was associated with increased IL-7R expression; in vitro data showed persistent antigen-independent activation and higher metabolic activity of cilta-cel vs. ide-cel CAR T.

 Human immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies are a major class of biotherapeutics and undergo N-linked glycosylation in their Fc domain, which is critical for immune functions and therapeutic activity. Hence, technologies for producing authentically glycosylated IgGs are in high demand. Previous attempts to engineer Escherichia coli for this purpose have met limited success due in part to the lack of oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) enzymes that can install N-glycans at the conserved N297 site in the Fc region. Here, we identify a single-subunit OST from Desulfovibrio marinus with relaxed substrate specificity that catalyzes glycosylation of native Fc acceptor sites. By chemoenzymatic remodeling the attached bacterial glycans to homogeneous, asialo complex-type G2 N-glycans, the E. coli-derived Fc binds human FcγRIIIa/CD16a, a key receptor for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Overall, the discovery of D. marinus OST provides previously unavailable biocatalytic capabilities and sets the stage for using E. coli to produce fully human antibodies.

Here, authors report a 3D-printed scaffold, HS-ICTO, integrating sono-activable and biocatalytic properties, which generates ROS for tumor eradication while promoting oxygen production to alleviate hypoxia, working towards both osteosarcoma treatment and bone repair. 
 To mitigate the necessity for multiple invasive procedures in treating malignant osteosarcoma, an innovative therapeutic approach is imperative to achieve controllable tumor-killing effects and subsequent bone repair. Here, we propose the de novo design of sono-activable and biocatalytic nanoparticles-modified 3D-printed hydroxyapatite (HA) scaffold (HS-ICTO) for intelligently sequential therapies in osteosarcoma eradication and bone defect regeneration. The engineered HS-ICTO scaffold displays superior, spatiotemporally controllable H2O2-catalytic performances, which promptly generate massive reactive oxygen species via multienzyme-like mechanisms coupled with sono-activation, thus augmenting tumor cell apoptosis. Furthermore, HS-ICTO can intelligently switch to catalyze H2O2 to O2 within the inflammatory bone defect microenvironment, effectively blocking endogenous H2O2-mediated oxidative stress, which positively modulates the osteogenic differentiation of stem cells and ultimately facilitates defect regeneration.

 Corynebacterium diphtheriae clade species secrete single-domain endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidases (ENGases) that specifically bind to human IgG antibodies and hydrolyze their N297-linked glycans. Here, we define the molecular mechanisms of IgG-specific deglycosylation for the entire family of corynebacterial IgG-specific ENGases, including but not limited to CU43 and CM49. By solving the crystal structure of CU43 in a 1:1 complex with the IgG1 Fc region, combined with targeted and saturation mutagenesis analysis and activity measurements using engineered antibodies, we establish an inter-protomeric mechanism of recognition and deglycosylation of IgG antibodies. Using in silico modeling, small-angle X-ray scattering and saturation mutagenesis we determine that CM49 uses a unique binding site on the Fc region, to process N297-linked glycans. Moreover, we demonstrate that CU43 treatment is highly effective in abrogating Fc effector functions in humanized mouse models, while preserving the neutralizing capacity of anti-influenza IgG antibodies, thereby conferring protection against lethal influenza challenge.

 Low back pain (LBP), primarily driven by intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD), has become a core challenge in public health. DDX1, an RNA-binding protein, plays key roles in RNA metabolism but its function in IVDD remains unclear. We identify DDX1 as a substrate of methyltransferase EZH2, which methylates DDX1 at lysine 234 (K234), promoting IVDD in vitro and in vivo. EZH2 inhibition restores matrix homeostasis in nucleus pulposus (NP) cells and slows IVDD progression. Methylation at DDX1 K234 disrupts its interaction with splicing factors and RNA targets, promoting exon 14 skipping in MATR3. This truncated MATR3 disrupts nuclear architecture, increases chromatin accessibility, and activates signaling pathways such as Wnt, leading to NP cell senescence and apoptosis. Notably, delivery of MATR3-L-overexpressing mRNA via cationic lipid nanoparticles reduces NP cell degeneration and significantly alleviates IVDD, offering important insights into IVDD pathogenesis and potential therapeutic strategies.

We investigate by using average predictability time (APT) analysis to filter wintertime, seasonal precipitation hindcasts provided by the Seamless System for Prediction and Earth System Research. Using this method, which decomposes forecasts into predictable modes, we find limited potential to improve seasonal precipitation forecasts over North America owing to the subseasonal predictability timescales of most APT modes. Nevertheless, more skillful forecasts of APT mode 2, which is tied to equatorial Pacific convection and has a predictability timescale of about 220 days, may improve seasonal precipitation forecasts over North America.

 Feasting played an important role in cementing social bonds between prehistoric communities. At Early Neolithic Asiab, western Iran, ceremonial feasting is evidenced by the butchered skulls of nineteen wild boars (Sus scrofa), an animal that was not commonly hunted in the region at the time. Here we use microscopic dental growth patterns to guide geochemical analyses of five wild boar teeth from Asiab and examine the geographical scope from which the animals derived. Our dataset includes 165 stable oxygen isotope values, 107 strontium isotope ratios, and Barium concentration maps. The findings indicate that despite Asiab’s location in an environment favourable to wild boars, the animals used for ceremonial feasting originated from a wide geographical catchment, with at least some necessitating transport over substantial distance across mountainous terrain. This deepens our understanding of the effort invested by the participating pre-agricultural communities for celebrating social connectivity across the wider landscape.

 Volcanic ash aggregation occurs during transport in the atmosphere when individual ash particles collide and stick together. It significantly impacts ash residence time in the atmosphere, with major consequences for hazard assessment and ash dispersal forecasts. Nonetheless, aggregation processes are still not adequately parametrized, mostly due to the low preservation potential of most aggregate types. We present here the first, detailed structural and morphological characterization of the major aggregate types, combining an innovative field collection strategy, which allows for the original aggregate structure to be preserved at deposition, coupled to X-Ray micro-tomography. Resulting observations together with weather information, allowed for the structure of fragile ash clusters and of the elusive cored Ash Pellets (cAP1s) to be fully resolved and their genesis to be better described.

 Functional diversity can be assessed remotely from optical sensors using vegetation index-based plant traits. Without effective corrections, employed reflectance values are affected by absorption and scattering processes in the atmosphere and on the ground, which modify radiance and irradiance values used for the reflectance retrieval. Additionally, the anisotropic nature of vegetation canopies induces observation and illumination angle-dependent reflectance variations. Often, however, the reflectance retrieval is not accurate enough to compensate for these effects in the atmosphere and on the surface, resulting in uncertain reflectance values. Furthermore, the effects in retrieved reflectance values propagate into derived products, like the vegetation indices used for calculating functional diversity, where they manifest as apparent differences between temporally close observations of the same area. A key to compensating for these effects lies in the capacity and consideration of several processing steps, such as atmospheric, topographic, and anisotropy correction.To date, it is unknown how these effects and their correction influence the estimation of functional richness. Here, we estimate functional richness based on three differently retrieved reflectance datasets in the overlapping area of three consecutively acquired flight lines with short temporal differences but with three distinct acquisition geometries. We analyze how atmospheric, topographic, and anisotropy effects influence functional richness estimates and how functional richness varies due to different observation and illumination angles.We show that reflectance data before correction for atmospheric, topographic, and anisotropy effects yield up to 15% larger median functional richness estimates compared to data after respective corrections. We discuss under which circumstances comprehensive data processing can reduce between-observation differences. Furthermore, we show that resulting functional richness estimates correlate with the number of shaded pixels (r2 ≈ 0.7). Consequently, observations in the solar principal plane with more or fewer shadows can lead to larger or smaller functional richness estimates and to differences compared to observations perpendicular to the solar principal plane.We conclude with recommendations concerning best-suited data processing and acquisition geometry for reliable and repeatable assessments of functional richness from optical remote sensing data and discuss applications to aerial and space-based observations of functional diversity."

 Urbanization has shaped a dynamic relationship between urban grey and green spaces, and this relationship will profoundly affect the stability and sustainability of the urban system. However, few studies have focused on the complex dynamics, spatial patterns, and dominant factors of the coordination between urban grey and green spaces. Therefore, this study develops a grey-green space trade-offs indicator (GGSCI) to assess the dynamic relationship between vegetated and non-vegetated areas during the growth of urban built-up areas. The GGSCI is implemented to evaluate the long-term dynamics of urban growth across 121 cities in the arid zone of northern China (ANC) from 1990 to 2020. We use Mean-Kendall trend analysis methods to capture the typical features of urban greening, and an interpretable machine learning model is combined to reveal the relative contributions of socioeconomic and natural environment indicators to the GGSCI. The results indicate that: the built-up area of ANC has expanded by 5.72 times from 1990 to 2020. Total grey space growth is 2.12 times that of green space. In addition, the relationship between grey and green spaces in ANC is moving from imbalance to balance, with the percentage of cities in imbalance dropping from a maximum of 23.28 % to 0 %.

 Global warming is expected to increase the frequency of extreme flooding, making rapid and accurate flood mapping crucial for effective risk assessment. Many governmental agencies and organizations are developing flood risk assessment tools; however, due to the lack of observational records, some rely on probabilistic generated data, uncalibrated simulations, or terrain-based methods, all of which are subject to various types of uncertainty. Although remote sensing provides valuable flood data with global coverage, single-source reliance is constrained by satellite revisit rates, resolution, weather conditions, and sensor limitations. To address these challenges, this study introduces a user-friendly application on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform that enables near-real-time global flood mapping using a multi-source remote sensing approach. By leveraging optical and SAR imagery, the App ensures improved water detection accuracy and supports all-weather and day/night monitoring. Our results show SAR and optical flood inundation maps agree up to 80 %.

 With continued global warming, heatwave events have become more frequent and intense, making it crucial to study the changes and physical mechanisms of these events in recent years. Sea surface temperature (SST) variations are closely related to heatwaves variability. However, the influences of dominant SST modes on the decadal variation of heatwaves in China are still not well understood, especially for the synergistic impacts of these modes. This study investigates the spatio-temporal characteristics and decadal variation of warm season heatwaves across China and further explores the underlying mechanisms of their decadal variability based on observational datasets and reanalysis products. The results reveal a significant shift around the 1990s: heatwave activity generally declined before this period but has intensified markedly since then. Some dynamic and thermal variables influencing heatwaves have all become more conducive to the occurrence of heatwaves in most parts of China since the 1990s. We analyze the individual and synergistic impacts of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) on the intensification of warm season heatwaves in China. The individual impacts of AMO are through two mechanisms or pathways. ① modulated Rossby waves: it excites an eastward-propagating Rossby wave train from the North Atlantic, forming barotropic anomalous anticyclones over the Tibetan Plateau and the Mongolian Plateau; ② coupled oceanic-atmospheric mechanisms: it enhances the Walker Circulation and further strengthens the Western Pacific subtropical high. IOD are only through Rossby wave trains propagating from the Indian Ocean and the North Atlantic to China. Based on the different phase combinations of AMO and IOD to study their synergistic effects, we found that positive AMO is the primary SST mode driving the heatwave intensification with Rossby waves being the main pathway. IOD plays a secondary role with its positive and negative phases corresponding to different Rossby wave paths in the Indian Ocean. Meanwhile, positive IOD is more strongly associated with the enhancement of Walker circulation."

 The atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and its variation in coastal regions are of great significance for weather forecast and wind energy. Nevertheless, the influence of onshore winds on the ABL height (ABLH) remain poorly understood, largely due to the scarcity of observations. Here, for the first time, we retrieved the daytime ABLH and turbulence dissipation rate (ε) using one-year (2022) worth of wind profiling measurements from eight radar wind profile stations along the southeast coast of China. Afterwards, the spatial and temporal variability of ABLH were investigated, with a focus on the effect of onshore winds on the ABLH. The ABLH follows the same semi-diurnal variation pattern as that of ε. Moreover, the mean ABLH during summer (winter) onshore wind periods is decreases (increases) with the increase of onshore wind intensity. This indicates that the influence of onshore winds on ABLH varies seasonally. In summer, the onshore winds bring the cold marine air masses to the warm land surface, which lowers the temperature inside the ABL and reduces turbulence intensity, thereby suppressing the development of ABLH. By contrast, in winter, the onshore winds caused by temperature difference increase the level of vertical wind shear within the ABL, which enhances the turbulence intensity, thus promoting the development of ABLH. The findings obtained here are useful for understanding the variations of ABLH under different wind conditions in coastal areas."

This carboxylation enhanced the ability of MAVS to induce type I interferons while suppressing the induction of apoptosis. Genetic knockout of GGCX, a VK-free diet, or depletion of VK by inhibiting VK epoxide reductase 1 with warfarin increased viral susceptibility in mice. Thus, we identified a MAVS regulatory mechanism—the existence of cytoplasmic protein carboxylation and topological inversion of GGCX—and demonstrated how modulating VK levels may influence antiviral defense."

When an anyon excitation is emitted toward a quantum point contact (QPC) in a fractional quantum Hall (FQH) fluid, this memory translates into tunneling events that may occur long after the anyon excitation has exited the QPC. In this work, we used triggered anyon pulses incident on a QPC in a filling factor ν = 1/3 FQH fluid to investigate anyon tunneling in the time domain. We observed that braiding increases the tunneling timescale, which is set by the temperature and the anyon scaling dimension that characterizes the edge-state dynamics. Our experiment introduces time-domain measurements for characterizing the braiding phase and scaling dimension of anyons."

Optogenetic reactivation of social memories of females, but not males, induced place preference.

We developed a spectral analysis–based approach that provides detailed estimates of the timescales at which vegetation tracks climate change, from 101to 105years. We report dynamic similarity of vegetation and climate even at centennial frequencies (149−1to 18,012−1year−1, that is, one cycle per 149 to 18,012 years). A breakpoint in vegetation turnover (797−1year−1) matches a breakpoint between stochastic and autocorrelated climate processes, suggesting that ecological dynamics are governed by climate across these frequencies. Heightened vegetation turnover at millennial frequencies (4650−1year−1) highlights the risk of abrupt responses to climate change, whereas vegetation-climate decoupling at frequencies >149−1year−1may indicate long-lasting consequences of anthropogenic climate change for ecosystem function and biodiversity."

While terrestrial biosphere models predict rising carbon sequestration in forests, direct observations of tree growth are inconclusive due to varying standardization procedures of tree-ring series and complex factors influencing stem growth such as moisture and nutrient deficits and anthropogenic carbon and nitrogen fertilization. The mismatch between tree-ring-based observations, repeated inventories at permanent plots, and predictions of biospheric models represents a significant knowledge gap limiting forecasting of future forest growth. Using the novel approach free of tree-ring standardization trials and focusing on even-aged trees sampled from uneven-aged forest stands, we present a robust comparison of tree stem diameter changes in temperate forests between 1990 and 2015 along environmental gradients in Central Europe. The stem sizes of four out of five species showed significant enlargement while also partly increasing stem growth limitation due to moisture availability. The largest increase in stem diameter was recorded for late succession species on fertile sites. By contrast, the stem size of early-succession species on dry and nutrient-poor sites remained unaltered. Stems of mature trees in present-day forests are, on average, 8% thicker than their counterparts in 1990 consistent with trends predicted by terrestrial biosphere models. We demonstrated that, despite increasing drought limitation, temperate tree species enlarged their stems. Viewed in conjunction with older permanent plot data, Central-European temperate forests exhibited almost half century of continuous stem enlargement, potentially impacting forest functioning in terms of size-sensitive characteristics such as susceptibility to drought and disturbances."

Vegetation change can be either natural or artificial. However, the specific effects of natural growth (NG) and artificial restoration (AR) of vegetation on surface hydrology remain unclear. Using a recently developed ecohydrological model, we demonstrate that NG and AR have contrasting spatial impacts on hydrological components across China’s Yellow River Basin, a hotspot with intensive human-driven revegetation over the recent decades. Our analysis identifies a critical annual precipitation threshold of 300 mm, below which both NG and AR have marginal hydrological impact. In regions where precipitation exceeds this threshold, NG significantly reduces evapotranspiration and increases runoff, while AR has the opposite effects. These results suggest that NG is a more sustainable strategy in areas receiving less than 300 mm of annual precipitation, while AR may be appropriate for regions with precipitation higher than this threshold. Our findings offer valuable guidance for policymakers in designing sustainable revegetation strategies tailored to local environmental conditions."

However, the absence of high-quality data on crop yields at fine spatial resolutions in many regions of the world makes it challenging to statistically model their response to interannual variability in weather patterns. Therefore, there is a need for empirical methods that can project annual crop yield changes even in limited data regions. Here, we propose a transfer learning algorithm that uses high spatial resolution data from one region to project yields in another region with more limited data. The goal of our work is to understand what data types can be beneficial for transferring learning from a source region to a very different target region with more limited data. We utilize Long Short-Term Memory to develop a transfer learning model that is trained on historical county-level corn yield in the United States and predicts district-level corn yield variations in India. Even using smaller amounts of data in India, simulating a data-scarce region, we achieve an average root mean square error of 0.48 bu acre−1 in predicting interannual yield variations. Using Shapley values to interpret results, we explore the contribution of the different weather parameters to interannual yield variability and find a larger influence of precipitation-related variables. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of this method for transferring models of weather impacts on crop yields trained on a data-rich country to one with more limited data. It suggests the potential of applying the transfer learning model to mitigate the need for extensive raw data globally."

Through the synergetic integration of multi-temporal datasets encompassing landscape ecological risk (LER), ecosystem service value (ESV) and ecosystem stability sustainability (ESS), we formulate a novel three-dimensional analytical framework based on ‘pattern-service-stability’. This methodological advancement enables the quantification of dynamic ecosystem risk in the Poyang Lake Plain from 2000 to 2035 through multi-scenario simulation. The results reveal that (1) changes in forest, water and impervious land exhibit significant scenario dependence. The ecological protection (EP) scenario preserved higher forest–water proportions, while the urban growth (UG) scenario exhibited accelerated construction expansion, with the natural development scenario maintaining transitional states. (2) LER remains consistently low across periods, characterised by stability and minimal inter-scenario variations. The ESV shows a decreasing trend, with high ESV areas decreasing abruptly and becoming concentrated in Poyang Lake’s southern bay. The low ESV increases significantly in the UG scenario, while the EP scenario maintains a higher service capacity. The ESS displays pronounced spatial heterogeneity. Extreme values of ESS tend to be flat, while high-grade ESS dominates under the EP scenario. (3) The interaction among LER, ESV and ESS has significant spatio-temporal heterogeneity and policy sensitivity. The lakeshore is mostly characterised by ‘low LER-high ESS’, while near-lake zone is concentrated in ‘high LER-low ESS’, with the ESV in each zone mostly in an intermediate state. (4) The growth rate and spatial variation of the ecosystem risk index (ERI) were small during 2000–2023, but ERI was predicted to surge under the UG scenario. (5) The ecosystem risk evolution paths are different in each zone and roughly conform to a linear fit, with the lakeshore exhibiting accelerated risk escalation.

The exploration of long-term nutrient trajectories for nitrogen model (ELEMeNT-N) has been applied to estimate legacy effects in several watersheds globally. However, ELEMeNT-N does not account for the accumulation-release processes of nitrate within soil profile, introducing potential uncertainty in long-term simulations. This study enhances ELEMeNT-N by incorporating a soil nitrate accumulation coefficient and a deep soil nitrate cycling module to better assess the long-term impact of legacy N on water quality. Long-term simulation for riverine N flux in the Yongan watershed, China (1980–2022) indicate that the modified model, ELEMeNT-N-SP, demonstrated significantly improved performance relative to the original model (Nash–Sutcliff coefficient: 0.89 vs 0.72, R2: 0.89 vs. 0.71). ELEMeNT-N-SP results indicate that ∼39.5% of N input accumulated in soil and groundwater, mainly in agricultural soil-groundwater. Legacy N contributed to 81.7% (Temporal: 65.6%–92.0%; i.e. cumulative contributions of historical N inputs) of riverine N flux (466 kg N ha−1). Among 12 modeling units, legacy N accumulation (SON: 175–1083 kg N ha−1; soil nitrate: −11–259 kg N ha−1; groundwater: 147–656 kg N ha−1) and its contribution to riverine N flux (Spatial: 64.0%–85.5%) showed considerable spatial heterogeneity. Agricultural soil-groundwater served as the primary accumulation sink for N input and the important source of riverine N pollution. Model validation, which included comparisons with monitored soil-groundwater N content and dual stable isotope data, confirmed the reliability of ELEMeNT-N-SP. ELEMeNT-N-SP offers a valuable framework for improving watershed nutrient management globally, emphasizing the importance of incorporating soil N cycling dynamics into predictive tools."

First, understanding the systemic interactions underlying sustainable development as envisioned in the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is key. In the context of urban transport systems, this includes understanding what hinders or fosters reduced carbon emissions. Second, systemic knowledge must be coupled with a strong societal and political engagement. This study analyses whether citizen assessments of key SDG interactions in urban transport systems play a role in predicting individual transport mode choices. Normatively, changes in individually held systemic perspectives could encourage greater use of low-carbon transport modes in urban and peri-urban areas, which would be an essential step toward climate change mitigation. We use survey data (n = 822) to measure citizens’ perspectives on the urban transport system and their transportation habits in terms of car driving, cycling, or public transport. We use a Bayesian multilevel regression model to investigate ‘How do citizen assessments of SDG interactions influence transport mode choices?’. We find that negative citizen assessments of the influence of car-related (1) infrastructure and (2) transport affordability on reduced carbon emissions are associated with reduced frequency of car-driving. Conversely, we find that positive citizen assessments of the influence of (3) road safety for cyclists and (4) public transport affordability on reduced carbon emissions are associated with increased frequency of cycling and public transport use, respectively."

Our findings indicate that MACA-CMIP5 accurately captures the magnitude and spatial patterns of seasonally averaged FWI but tends to underestimate historical decadal trends. We show that future increases in fire risk may be underestimated relative to the simple time series model that projects historical variability into the future.

After reaching net-zero CO2 emissions, the state of the North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) is characterized by two different pathways, either fast warming or slow warming. We found that both El Niño and La Niña events have intensified during the North Atlantic fast warming period compared to that during the North Atlantic slow warming period. This is due to the strengthening of the La Niña-like mean state in the tropical Pacific under the rapid warming of the North Atlantic, which enhances the Ekman pumping feedback and zonal advective feedback. Therefore, this study suggests that in a net-zero CO2 emission environment, ENSO amplitude can either increase or decrease, but it is regulated by the North Atlantic SST state, implying that the inter-basin interactions should be considered to understand ENSO variability even after reaching net-zero emissions."

 The ocean-surface downward longwave radiation (Rl) is one of the most fundamental components of the radiative energy balance, and it has a remarkable influence on air–sea interactions. Because of various shortcomings and limits, a lot of empirical models have been established for ocean-surface Rl estimation for practical applications. In this paper, based on comprehensive measurements collected from 65 moored buoys distributed across global seas from 1988 to 2019, a new model for estimating the all-sky ocean-surface Rl at both hourly and daily scales was built. The ocean-surface Rl was formulated as a nonlinear function of the screen-level air temperature, relative humidity, cloud fraction, total column cloud liquid, and ice water. A comprehensive evaluation of this new model relative to eight existing models was conducted under clear-sky and all-sky conditions at daytime/nighttime hourly and daily scales. The validation results showed that the accuracy of the newly constructed model is superior to that of other models, yielding overall root mean square error (RMSE) values of 13.44 and 8.34 W m−2 under clear-sky conditions and 15.64 and 10.27 W m−2 under all-sky conditions at hourly and daily scales, respectively. Our analysis indicates that the effects of the total column cloud liquid and ice water on the ocean-surface Rl also need to be considered in addition to cloud cover.

This approach has far fewer computational requirements than running climate models at high resolution. 
 Arctic air temperatures have increased approximately 4 times faster than the global average since about 1980. Consequently, the Greenland ice sheet has lost approximately twice as much ice as the Antarctic ice sheet between 2003 and 2019, and mass loss from glaciers and ice caps is also dominated by those that lie in the Arctic. Thus, Arctic land ice loss is currently a major contributor to global sea level rise. This increasing freshwater flux into the Arctic and North Atlantic oceans, will also affect physical, chemical and biological processes across a range of domains and spatiotemporal scales. To date, meltwater discharge data at Arctic coastlines are only available from two datasets that are limited by their spatial resolution and/or coverage.

Existing datasets, however, have low spatial resolutions or limited temporal coverage. This study introduces China's annual forest age dataset (CAFA), spanning 1986–2022 at a 30 m resolution. By tracking forest disturbances, we annually update ages. Validation shows small errors for disturbed forests and larger errors for undisturbed forests. CAFA can enhance carbon cycle modeling and forest management in China. 
 Forest age is crucial for both carbon cycle modeling and effective forest management. Remote sensing provides crucial data for large-scale forest age mapping, but existing products often suffer from a low spatial resolution (typically 1000 m), making them unsuitable for most forest stands in China, which are generally smaller than this threshold. Recent studies have generated static forest age products for 2019 (CAFA V1.0) (Shang et al., 2023a) and 2020 (Cheng et al., 2024) at a 30 m spatial resolution. However, their low temporal resolution limits their applicability to track multiyear forest carbon changes. This study aims to generate China's annual forest age dataset (CAFA V2.0) at a 30 m resolution from 1986 to 2022, utilizing forest disturbance monitoring and machine learning techniques. Forest disturbance monitoring, which typically has lower uncertainty compared to machine learning approaches, is primarily employed to update annual forest age. The modified COLD (mCOLD) algorithm, which incorporates spatial information and bidirectional monitoring, was used for forest disturbance monitoring. For undisturbed forests, forest age was estimated using machine learning models trained separately for different regions and forest cover types, with inputs including forest height, vegetation indices, climate, terrain, and soil data. Additionally, adjustments were made for underestimations in the Northeastern and Southwestern regions of China identified in CAFA V1.0 using additional reference age samples and region-specific and forest-type-specific models. Validation, using a randomly selected 30 % of two reference datasets, indicated that the mapped age of disturbed forest exhibited a small error of ±2.48 years, while the mapped age of undisturbed forest from 1986 to 2022 had a larger error of ±7.91 years. The generated 30 m annual forest age dataset can facilitate forest carbon cycle modeling in China, offering valuable insights for national forest management practices.

Traditional models struggle with accurately simulating burned areas due to simplified processes. By combining the predictive power of machine learning with a land model, our hybrid framework better captures fire dynamics. This approach enhances our understanding of wildfire behavior and aids in developing more effective climate and fire management strategies. 
 Wildfires have shown increasing trends in both frequency and severity across the contiguous United States (CONUS). However, process-based fire models have difficulties in accurately simulating the burned area over the CONUS due to a simplification of the physical process and cannot capture the interplay among fire, ignition, climate, and human activities. The deficiency of burned area simulation deteriorates the description of fire impact on energy balance, water budget, and carbon fluxes in the Earth system models (ESMs). Alternatively, fire models based on machine learning (ML), which capture statistical relationships between the burned area and environmental factors, have shown promising burned area predictions and corresponding fire impact simulation. We develop a hybrid framework (ELM2.1-XGBFire1.0) that integrates an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) wildfire model with the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) land model (ELM) version 2.1. A Fortran–C–Python deep learning bridge is adapted to support online communication between ELM and the ML fire model. Specifically, the burned area predicted by the ML-based wildfire model is directly passed to ELM to adjust the carbon pool and vegetation dynamics after disturbance, which are then used as predictors in the ML-based fire model in the next time step. Evaluated against the historical burned area from Global Fire Emissions Database 5 from 2001–2019, the ELM2.1-XGBFire1.0 outperforms process-based fire models in terms of spatial distribution and seasonal variations. The ELM2.1-XGBFire1.0 has proven to be a new tool for studying vegetation–fire interactions and, more importantly, enables seamless exploration of climate–fire feedback, working as an active component of E3SM."

Identifying their sources, transport, and ecological risk is limited in heterogeneous urban watersheds. We present an integrative watershed approach using source-specific indicator compounds, common water quality measures, and ecotoxicity assays to examine the distribution of contaminant mixtures in an urbanized watershed. Indicator compound concentrations were temporally and spatially distributed for treated/untreated sewage (sucralose, artificial sweetener), road runoff (diphenyl-guanidine [DPG] and 6PPD-quinone [6PPD-Q], automobile tire additives), and lawncare runoff (aminomethanephosphonic acid (AMPA), major degradant of the herbicide glyphosate). Sucralose was predominately sourced from treated wastewater; measurable concentrations in tributaries indicated raw sewage inputs. DPG and 6PPD-Q concentrations correlated to road density during base flow and were elevated during stormflow. AMPA was measurable spring through fall, especially where lawns were dense. When specific sources dominated flow, water quality measures correlated with wastewater (sulfate, potassium, chloride, and sodium) and road runoff (chromium and lead) indicators. The limited behavioral toxicity observed in exposed zebrafish (Danio rerio) (18%) was not well explained by source-indicators.

Up to 12 nonionic and 12 ionic FBs were detected, with detection frequencies ranging from 5% to 96%, marking their first reported occurrence in these biological matrices. Median FB concentrations were 5.83 ng/mL in breast milk and 13.1 ng/mL in urine, with ionic FBs being more abundant than nonionic FBs. Comparative analysis indicated that ionic FBs were primarily excreted in urine, while nonionic FBs exhibited higher detection frequencies and concentrations in breast milk compared to urine. Multivariate analysis revealed that greater consumption of convenience foods and bottled water was associated with increased nonionic FB exposure, whereas higher use of personal care products predicted greater ionic FB exposure. Exposure assessment identified breastfeeding as a significant pathway for infant FB exposure. Although the high estimated daily intakes (2190 ng/kg bw/day) may not pose immediate risks, it exceeded levels of some well-known toxicants such as PFASs by several fold.

However, conventional SDIE systems have struggled to enhance evaporation efficiency while mitigating salt scaling. Here, we introduce an innovative 3D-printed photothermal stainless steel SDIE system designed to address these limitations. By leveraging the high thermal conductivity of stainless steel, our design creates a strategic temperature differential across the SDIE, maximizing energy harvesting from solar radiation, ambient air, and feedwater. The unique edge-protruding structure facilitates localized salt crystallization and autonomous detachment, achieving effective salt self-collection. Numerical simulations reveal that Marangoni convection drives liquid flow toward the edge for the controlled salt crystallization. Under one sun radiation, our system achieves a remarkable evaporation rate of 3.18 kg m–2 h–1 and a salt collection rate of 1.57 kg m–2 h–1 with highly concentrated brine (25 wt % NaCl solution). Outdoor and real brine tests validated its capability for zero liquid discharge desalination, demonstrating both enhanced desalination efficiency and sustainable brine management through simultaneous water recovery and salt collection.

Previous research has focused on vegetative wildfires with nothing known about DBPs from wildland-urban interface wildfires.

Chlorination of the water-soluble fraction of structural ashes caused formation of higher levels of brominated, iodinated, and nitrogenous DBPs than the vegetation ashes due to structural ashes containing greater levels of water-soluble bromide and iodide. Chloramination reduced total DBP formation and calculated cytotoxicity vs chlorination, except in two structural ashes where iodinated and nitrogenous DBP formation was high.

This study presents the first systematic investigation linking sediment dredging to long-term carbon sequestration dynamics in river ecosystems, addressing critical uncertainties in anthropogenic impacts on aquatic carbon balance. Over a three-year period, dredging significantly altered CO2 flux (fCO2) and dissolved CO2 partial pressure (pCO2), with pronounced seasonal variability driven by dissolved organic carbon as a key predictor. Microbial community composition shifted from Cyanobacteria to Gammaproteobacteria and Flavobacteria dominance, accompanied by enhanced Calvin cycle enzyme gene expression and suppression of alternative carbon fixation pathways. While phytoplankton biomass, particularly Cyanobacteria, declined sharply during dredging, carbon sequestration potential exceeded predredging levels within three years of monitoring, indicating strong resilience in riverine carbon storage capacity. Our findings indicate that (1) dredging-induced community restructuring enhances chemoautotrophic carbon fixation through modified expression of rTCA cycle components and Calvin cycle optimization, (2) phytoplankton carbon biomass and chlorophyll a emerge as primary drivers of postdredging carbon sequestration pathways, and (3) gross primary production peaks at 960.8 mg C m–2 d–1 through synergistic phytoplankton interactions.

The gas-phase oxidation mechanism of γ-terpinene is essential for understanding its influence on atmospheric chemistry and its implications for human health. Utilizing quantum chemical calculations and computational toxicology simulations, we examined the •OH-mediated atmospheric transformation and toxicological progression of γ-terpinene in the indoor environment. The results indicate that •OH additions are the dominant pathways for the reaction of •OH + γ-terpinene. The most favorable reactive intermediates formed from the •OH-addition reactions subsequently react with O2 to form hydroxy γ-terpinene peroxy radicals (OH-γ-terp-RO2•). The formed OH-γ-terp-RO2• follows concerted peroxy radical (RO2•) and alkoxy radical (RO•) modulated autoxidation, providing a new case for such a mechanism beyond the well-known only RO2-driven autoxidation mechanism. Our findings also reveal that the transformation of OH-γ-terp-RO2• demonstrates the competitive nature of the cyclization pathway indoors, with dicarbonyl formation, a rarely observed process in hydroxy terpene RO2 reaction systems. Toxicological evaluations further indicate that a significant proportion of transformation products (TPs) display higher mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, skin sensitization, and irritation to eyes compared to γ-terpinene.

Two damage pathways have been suggested to explain this relationship: that high temperatures directly stress crops and drive yield loss, or that high temperatures induce water stress in crops, which in turn drives yield loss. Here we explore a third pathway: that soil water stress limits both agricultural productivity and evaporative cooling, giving rise to the nonlinear relationship between temperature and yield. Determining which of these pathways underpins the yield‐temperature relationship is important for predicting future crop productivity because climate change is expected to alter the co‐variability between temperature and water availability. To examine this third pathway, we use cumulative growing‐season transpiration from an idealized land surface model as a proxy for yield. This approach reproduces the observed yield‐temperature relationship, even though the model includes no mechanisms that limit productivity at high temperatures. In experiments where the influence of temperature on soil moisture is suppressed, yields still decline during hot, dry periods in a manner consistent with the observations. We conclude that water stress, and its influence on evaporative cooling, temperature, and agricultural productivity, drives the yield‐temperature relationship found in crops that experience episodic water stress. This framework explains the muted sensitivity of irrigated yields to high atmospheric temperatures, and suggests that future yield outcomes depend more critically on changes in rainfall than suggested by estimates that attribute yield losses primarily to temperature variations."

The new Vp/Vs transition trend provides new constraints for tracking the lizardite/antigorite transition with increasing metamorphic condition from field seismic data and thus studying geodynamic evolution in the subduction environment."

Here, we quantified PS of meteorological drought for the first time from the perspective of abnormal moisture transmission, and developed a novel framework, combining PS with the original complex network framework, to explore the topological characteristics of drought in mainland China (MC). The results show that non‐positive PS may misrepresent dependency of synchronous droughts, and such instances are widespread in MC (60.4%). Based on dependent droughts, network coefficients derived from the framework indicate that high values of positive PS are predominantly distributed in the humid‐arid transition zones.

Despite significant reductions in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations in China due to air pollution control measures, ozone (O3) pollution has worsened in recent years, with pronounced regional disparities in long‐term exposure to O3 and NO2. Assessing these disparities in exposure to gaseous pollutants and the resulting unequal health risks between urban and rural regions has become increasingly essential. The contributions of various anthropogenic emissions to O3 and NO2 were quantified using a source‐oriented version of the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, combined with population and GDP data sets. From 2010 to 2019, NOx and VOC emissions from non‐urban areas decreased by 14% and 25%, respectively, whereas urban anthropogenic activities caused a 10% increase in NOx emissions and a 22% rise in VOC emissions. The simulations indicated that background levels constituted the majority of maximum daily 8‐hr average O3 (MDA8 O3), contributing 83% in 2010 and 75% in 2019. Non‐urban anthropogenic activities were the primary sources of NO2, accounting for 64% in 2010 and 57% in 2019. The proportion of O3 and NO2 from urban anthropogenic emissions in the total concentration continuously increased between 2010 and 2019. Although overall O3‐related premature mortality increased by 51% and NO2‐related premature mortality decreased by 3% during this period, the number of premature mortalities related to O3 and NO2 from urban anthropogenic activities rose by 133% and 15% respectively.

However, the impact of climate change on the carbon cycle remains unclear. Here, we assess the spatiotemporal dynamics of net ecosystem productivity (NEP) in China's terrestrial ecosystems from 2010 to 2020 and its response to climate change using the regional climate‐chemistry‐ecology coupled model RegCM‐Chem‐YIBs. The estimations demonstrate that the national annual average NEP was 399.08 TgC yr−1 and increased by 8.83 TgC yr−1, effectively offsetting 15.4% of industrial carbon emissions. The NEP decreased gradually from southeast to northwest, with the maximum occurring in the southwest (122.31 TgC yr−1); the NEP intensity peaked in summer (102.31 gC m−2 yr−1). Climate change positively contributed to NEP (11.2 TgC yr−1), with significant interannual and regional differences. Precipitation anomalies in the southern region are the main meteorological factor for the interannual fluctuation of NEP. The increase in radiation led to an increase in NEP of 4.85 TgC yr−1 and dominated 46.49% of the region in China. The increase in NEP in the southern region was attributed to enhanced radiation, while the northern region benefited from increased precipitation and rising temperatures. These findings highlight the significant spatiotemporal variations in the impact of climate change on the carbon sinks of terrestrial ecosystems in China. It is essential to account for the effects of climate change and to adopt differentiated strategies to enhance carbon sinks during policy formulation."

We analyzed temperature and precipitation responses for 2050–2069 relative to 2015–2034 under SSP2‐4.5 and ARISE‐SAI‐1.5 scenarios. Our approach involved evaluating temperature and precipitation anomalies, applying signal‐to‐noise ratio (SNR) analysis—defined as the ratio of the forced climate response to internal variability—to assess signal robustness, and using cumulative distribution (CDF) and probability density (PDF) functions to explore shifts in precipitation extremes. Results indicate that under SSP2‐4.5, both models project significant warming. UKESM1 simulates increases near 1.8°C, while CESM2 projects between 1.0°C and 1.2°C. Under ARISE‐SAI‐1.5, UKESM1 shows pronounced cooling, with temperatures dropping up to 0.3°C below the reference period at some latitudes. CESM2 shows a more uniform cooling, with temperatures between 0°C and 0.3°C above the reference. SNR analysis reveals robust, statistically significant temperature changes across the region, clearly emerging above natural variability by midcentury. Precipitation changes, however, show lower SNR values and greater spatial uncertainty, suggesting weaker and less predictable hydrological responses. CDF and PDF analyses highlight complex shifts in precipitation extremes, suggesting that while SAI could counteract warming trends, it may introduce additional variability and uncertainty in rainfall projections. These results emphasize the importance of multimodel comparisons in assessing geoengineering impacts on regional climates, as differing sensitivities to radiative forcing and feedback can produce divergent outcomes."

Previous studies are mostly concerned with trends of seasonal frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation and interpret those trends based on long‐term changes in seasonal mean moisture. Present study analyzes trends of extreme precipitation frequency in sub‐periods of the rainy season (June and July) in central eastern China and roles of atmospheric circulation changes. It is found that the trends of extreme precipitation frequency have prominent subseasonal changes in central eastern China. The frequency of extreme precipitation displays an increasing trend in early June and early and middle July, but a decreasing trend in middle and late June and late July. The trends of extreme precipitation frequency are attributed to those of corresponding atmospheric circulation patterns in sub‐periods of the rainy season. Increasing (decreasing) trends of extreme precipitation frequency are associated with increasing (decreasing) lower‐level southwesterly winds over southeastern China, westward extending (eastward retreating) western North Pacific subtropical high and strengthening (weakening) East Asian trough. The mean atmospheric circulation trends play a role in the subseasonal changes in the trends of extreme precipitation frequency in central eastern China. The change in the mean moisture availability cannot explain subseasonal changes in the trends of extreme precipitation frequency. Present study suggests the necessity of analyzing extreme precipitation trends and roles of atmospheric circulation trends during sub‐periods of seasons."

Our analysis shows that the cumulative intensity and duration of global temperature extremes has increased by an average of 36% from 1990 to 2020 and is projected to rise by 52% over the next 30 years. The Global South, inhabited by 10% of the world's elderly (aged 69+), bears 53% of the EMRI during the 60‐year period. Low‐income regions experience the highest EMRI, averaging 4% more than other regions. Projections for 2021–2050 indicate that the global EMRI will peak in 2033 before gradually declining. South Asia (SA) and Southeast Asia are expected to be the most severely affected regions, with averaged EMRI 8% higher than those in the lowest‐risk regions. When focusing on age‐specific groups (69+), the global EMRI will be 59% higher, the EMRI disparity is projected to be 13 times greater between SA and the lowest‐risk regions, and 80 times greater between high‐income and low‐income regions, than when considering all‐age group.

This problem is especially pronounced for semi‐arid regions with large amounts of irrigated agriculture, such as California's Central Valley. In this region, increased ETo has increased irrigation demand, but the role of anthropogenic climate change (ACC) in driving this increase has not yet been quantified. Here, we quantified the influence of ACC on ETo and how these changes have translated into increased irrigation demand. We calculated observational ETo from ERA5‐Land and counterfactual ETo that removes the forced changes simulated by 20 models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 from the observational records. At the scale of North America, we found that ACC drove a 64 mm increase in annual ETo from 1980 to 2022, compared to the observed 54 mm increase. The largest observed increases in ETo were found in the southwestern and central regions, where ACC has likely exacerbated trends linked to natural climate variability. The largest ACC contributor to increased ETo was increased vapor pressure deficit, while decreased solar radiation has tempered increased ETo. Finally, we found that ACC has increased annual crop irrigation demand in the Central Valley by 0.76 km3 during 1980–2022, with cumulative increased irrigation demand of 9.2 km3, equivalent to ∼11% of the region's groundwater loss during this time. Our findings suggest that ACC is accelerating demand for water in this already water‐limited region, and this phenomenon is likely occurring in other semi‐arid agricultural regions of North America."

Here, authors demonstrate fast temporal anti-lasing that achieves coherent perfect absorption over ultrashort timescales by using topological transitions in hysteretic scattering systems. 
 Coherent perfect absorption (CPA), or anti-lasing, has been so far inherently restricted to continuous wave scenarios, drastically restricting its applications to standard linear steady-state systems. However, future technologies based on enhanced light-matter interactions typically require the dynamic emission and absorption of pulses, as in ultrafast optics, frequency-comb technologies, or spiking neuromorphic networks. Here, we propose to extend the reach of anti-lasing to pulsed operation. We unveil the phenomenon of fast temporal anti-lasing, in which perfect absorption of photons occurs transiently over ultrashort time scales, creating fast absorption pulses associated with broadband absorption frequency combs. This is obtained by leveraging robust topological transitions occurring in a hysteretic scattering system, which is temporally modulated to loop near a CPA singularity. Our work evidences the interplay between intrinsic memory and topology in wave scattering, unveiling the rich physics of Floquet engineering through topological switching. We envision applications in spiking photonic networks with robust emission, routing and detection of spikes, which may form the basis for future analog neuromorphic hardware.

 The conventional Kibble-Zurek mechanism and the finite-time scaling provide universal descriptions of the driven critical dynamics from gapped initial states based on the adiabatic-impulse scenario. Here we investigate the driven critical dynamics in two-dimensional Dirac systems, which harbor semimetal and Mott insulator phases separated by the quantum critical point triggered by the interplay between fluctuations of gapless Dirac fermions and order parameter bosons. We find that despite the existence of the gapless initial phase, the driven dynamics can still be captured by the finite-time scaling form. This leads us to propose a criterion for the validity of Kibble-Zurek mechanism with a gapless initial state. Accordingly, our results generalize the Kibble-Zurek theory to incorporate composite fluctuations and relax its requirement for a gapped initial state to systems accommodating gapless Dirac fermionic excitations. Our work not only brings fundamental perspective into the nonequilibrium critical dynamics, but also provides an approach to fathom quantum critical properties in fermionic systems.

 Eating disorders arise from a complex interaction of genetic and environmental influences. Here we provide comprehensive population-level estimates of the heritability of eating disorders and their genetic relationships with various mental health and cardiometabolic disorders (CMDs), expanding beyond genome-wide association studies. We examined the heritability of three eating disorders—anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and other eating disorders (OED)—and investigated shared familial and genetic risk factors with mental health disorders and CMDs. Using national register data from Denmark and Sweden (1972–2016), we analysed clinical diagnoses for over 67,000 individuals with eating disorders, their first-degree relatives, and matched controls from populations totalling 17 million. Heritability estimates were moderate, h2AN = 36%, h2BN = 39%, and h2OED = 30% and genetic correlations revealed substantial overlap between AN and obsessive-compulsive disorder (rg = 0.65) and moderate correlations with other mental health disorders such as autism (rg = 0.36). Significant genetic associations were also identified between eating disorders and CMDs, showing strong replication across both countries. These findings emphasise the genetic foundations of eating disorders and their shared genetic architecture with mental health and CMDs.

 Hyperbolic polaritons have drawn great attention in nanoscale light manipulation due to their unique properties. Currently, most studies focus on natural hyperbolic phonon materials in the mid-infrared, limiting their application in the visible to near-infrared range. Here, we present a work on broadband near-infrared hyperbolic plasmon polaritons in a van der Waals material MoOCl2 by a perturbation-free direct imaging technique of photoemission electron microscopy. In particular, the hyperbolic polariton behavior has been dynamically tailored and manipulated by wavelength, polarization, interlayer twist, and artificial structure, providing a reconfigurable platform for nanophotonic applications. Notably, the full iso-frequency contours can be reconstructed via polarization-selective excitations. Our work has contributed to hyperbolic materials in the broadband near-infrared with MoOCl2, and has revealed PEEM to be an ideal method for studying hyperbolic plasmon polaritons at the space-time limit. Materials with opposite signs of permittivity along the two orthogonal directions can support hyperbolic polaritons.

 Surface meltwater is predicted to become increasingly important for Antarctic mass loss as atmospheric temperatures rise, due to its potential to influence ice dynamic, hydrofracture and radiative processes. However, our understanding of Antarctic surface meltwater is limited, with previous studies restricted in spatial or temporal scope. Here, using cloud computing, we produce an Antarctic-wide, monthly dataset of surface meltwater for 2006 to 2021. Surface meltwater covered 3,732 km2 across Antarctica on average during each melt season, with 30% on grounded ice. High interannual variability in meltwater area across the Antarctic Peninsula and in East Antarctica correlates with large-scale modes of climate variability. In west Antarctica, meltwater area is comparatively low and this correlation is absent. An increase in the magnitude and variability of surface meltwater area without a coincident increase in modelled snowmelt in East Antarctica indicates that the ice-sheet surface might be becoming more favourable to meltwater ponding.

 Surface meltwater production influences the contribution of ice sheets to global sea-level change. Ice-sheet-wide meltwater production has thus far primarily been quantified by regional climate models. Here we present a 31-year (1992–2023) time series of daily satellite-observed surface melt flux for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. The annual meltwater volume in Greenland has significantly increased, with intensified melt in the northern basins dominated by a negative North Atlantic Oscillation and elevated melt flux in western basins driven by the decline in Arctic sea-ice. In East Antarctica, high melt rates since 2000 are attributed to warm air incursions from the Southern Ocean due to anomalous atmospheric circulations associated with a negative Southern Annular Mode and the recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole. This region, previously less prone to surface melt, has become a melt hotspot, potentially leading to meltwater ponding and future ice shelf destabilization.

 Europe’s rural landscapes, shaped over millennia, support high biodiversity but often have lower living standards than urban areas, potentially leading to social and environmental injustice. Here we studied biodiversity and socioeconomic settings in Central and Eastern European villages across landscape complexity and urbanization gradients. We surveyed the biodiversity of villages by sampling nine taxonomic groups, including plants, arthropods and birds. We found 15% lower multitrophic diversity in villages in agricultural than in forest-dominated landscapes. City vicinity enhanced human well-being (estimated with Better Life Index) but did not affect biodiversity despite a larger human footprint. In agglomerated villages in forest-dominated landscapes, biodiversity was high, with higher Better Life Index and footprint metrics, suggesting associations between biodiversity, socioeconomic status and, thus, environmental injustice. Our results show the high socioecological value of maintaining or restoring landscape complexity around villages and their green infrastructure, requiring top-down incentives and bottom-up initiatives.

 River and tidal dynamics regulate delta water levels, underpinning their ecological and socio-economic stability. Deltaic water level resilience, the capacity to recover from disturbances, is vital amid growing climate and human pressures, necessitating a robust method to quantify and monitor it. Here we define water level resilience as the rate of water level recovery post-hydrodynamic disturbances. We quantify resilience trends using autocorrelation and propose a high-dimensional resilience transmission method based on a vine Copula model to estimate the spatial propagation of resilience loss across subsystems. Applying this framework to the Pearl River Delta in China reveals spatial heterogeneity and inter-subsystem transmission of resilience loss driven by anthropogenic activities. Our approach can be extended to other major deltas, despite differing hydrodynamic and human impacts. The findings underscore the need for tailored management strategies addressing specific drivers and subsystem interactions, offering critical insights into the global delta preservation amid escalating environmental challenges.

We assess personal endorsement and perceptions of public support in national representative samples of the U.S. public (N = 1500) and local-level U.S. policymakers (N = 500). Proactive narratives, like ones advocating for both personal behavior and policy action, are widely endorsed, but both the public and policymakers greatly underestimate their popularity (a case of pluralistic ignorance), especially for narratives calling for systemic change. Greater endorsement of these narratives corresponded to greater willingness to take personal and political actions and support climate policy.

 Understanding the effect of marine heatwaves on organisms is central for improving climate change predictions. Even moderate heatwave events are likely to drive performance of organisms especially if they are long relative to the life cycle duration. In ectotherms, such events will affect biological time on a stage-dependent basis; they could alter the timing of life cycle events (e.g. spawning, reproduction) and cause reproductive failure. We use a mathematical framework to explore three different scenarios for the causal relationship between temperature and developmental time and help future experimental research. Here, we highlight the need to experimentally test for (1) stage-dependent responses to temperature and (2) plastic responses to the thermal history. (3) Consider traits linked to developmental time (e.g. body size) and (4) integrate across levels of organization to develop stronger explanatory models.

 Extreme stratospheric events, such as sudden stratospheric warmings or strong polar vortex events, can have a persistent influence on winter surface weather. While these changes often lead to shifts in extratropical cyclone tracks and increased risk of extreme winds, flooding, or heavy snowfall, there has been no systematic effort to quantify their associated impacts with respect to stratospheric forcing. Here we establish the connection between stratospheric extreme events and midlatitude storms in the Euro-Atlantic region using reanalysis of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and impact datasets. We show that storm-related hazards in northern Europe occur more frequently following strong vortex events than after sudden stratospheric warmings. Moreover, stratospheric forcing shapes the geographic pattern of storm impacts. Quantifying these connections - from precursors to hazards and impacts - can enable earlier warnings for society and for decision-makers in sectors such as emergency preparedness, public health, energy, and water management.

 Constraining the timing of accretion, differentiation, and breakup of early-formed protoplanets helps to unravel the Solar System’s evolution. The recent discovery of the oldest crustal material, Erg Chech 002, has provided important constraints on the timing of accretion and magmatism in the inner Solar System. Based on the age discrepancies of iron meteorites and basalts from the inner and outer Solar System reservoirs, it is accepted that protoplanets in the inner Solar System formed first. However, here we report on Northwest Africa 12264, a dunite originating from the outer Solar System, which records in-situ Pb–Pb and 26Al–26Mg ages of 4569.8 ± 4.6 and 4564.44 ± 0.30 Ma, respectively. This demonstrates that protoplanets beyond the snowline accreted, differentiated, and broke apart rapidly and concurrently with those in the inner Solar System.

 The rapid warming of the Tibetan Plateau, at more than twice the global average, raises urgent questions about how quickly alpine aquatic ecosystem can respond. Here, using lake sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) and photosynthetic pigment analysis, we investigated algal productivity and diversity (alpha, beta) changes in a Tibetan glacier lake, Guozha Co, China, and by integrating regional lake records, we further estimated the rate of change (RoC) associated with lake ecosystem and temperature over the past two centuries. Our findings reveal that while the RoC of algal communities historically tracked temperature trends, a significant divergence emerged in the 1980s, with the ecological RoC surpassing that of climate warming. The observed shift from cold-tolerant to warm-adapted algal species, alongside enhanced primary productivity, is closely linked to rising temperatures and the cascading effects of glacier retreat. This rate mismatch signals a significant disruption in the long-standing equilibrium between climate and aquatic ecosystems, with potentially far-reaching consequences for alpine biodiversity conservation under accelerating global change.

 The oceanic Kármán vortex street is a significant fluid dynamics phenomenon resulting from the unsteady separation of the boundary layer behind a bluff body. In this study, multispectral images from the Sustainable Development Goals Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1) were utilized to observe oceanic vortex streets in the Yellow Sea from 2021 to 2024. A statistical analysis of 114 vortex streets was conducted from both dynamic and morphological perspectives. The relationship between vortex streets and ocean currents was explored from multiple perspectives, including single-factor statistical analysis, multi-factor statistical analysis, and case studies. Experimental results indicate that the formation of vortex streets in the Yellow Sea is primarily driven by interactions between tidal currents and islands. Furthermore, the spatiotemporal distribution and characteristic parameters of oceanic vortex streets were analysed using time-series SDGSAT-1 data. The observation frequency of oceanic vortex streets follows a general pattern of higher frequency in winter and lower frequency in summer, with most characteristic parameters being stronger in winter and weaker in summer. The seasonal characteristics of tidal currents have a significant impact on the vortex street characteristics. High-resolution satellite imagery reveals that the average aspect ratio of vortex streets is 2.75 and the Reynolds number is 403.56 in winter, compared to 1.92 and 185.86, respectively, in summer. This research presents the first temporal observations and systematic analysis of oceanic vortex streets across an entire marine area, offering practical significance for advancing and implementing multiple targets under SDG 14."

 Uncertainty in the trends and variations of climate variables in climate data records is as important to understand as climate trends and variations themselves. Metrology provides the framework for assessing and budgeting uncertainty but the application of metrology to climate data records derived from Earth Observation is a scientific and technical challenge and a matter of research. We applied Monte Carlo methodology to demonstrate the end-to-end uncertainty budget for the quantitative variables (seasonal land surface spectral reflectance and plant functional type fractional coverage) of the Land Cover project within ESA’s Climate Change Initiative on the example of one year of Sentinel-3 OLCI remote sensing data and study cases in Africa, Europe, and South America. The budget considers most important sources of errors and takes account of uncorrelated and fully correlated random error structures. The interquartile range of relative standard uncertainty per datum of yearly land surface spectral reflectance is 0.050–0.108 at 490 nm, 0.015–0.046 at 560 nm, 0.007–0.062 at 665 nm, and 0.008–0.024 at 885 nm. The uncorrelated random component of seasonal land surface reflectance uncertainty diminishes with the duration of the season. Spectrally anti-correlated errors in seasonal land surface reflectance composites were attributed to a maximum spectral index selection criterion used for daily image composition. The typical range of standard uncertainty per datum of plant functional type fractional area coverage is 0.3 to 30.8 percent and depends on type abundance. Up to 3.5 percent of fractional coverage uncertainty is attributed to random fluctuation, higher uncertainty is caused by the variation of land cover classes. Errors in plant functional type fractional area coverage are typically anti-correlated. Confusion between natural and managed grass drives the uncertainty in African savannah."

 Dust devils, which are rotating vortices, frequently occur on the surface layer of dry land. The impacts of meteorological factors on dust devil properties at higher altitudes remain largely unexplored owing to a shortage of in situ observations on small-scale and short-lived vortices. Using radiosonde profiles and ERA5 reanalysis data together with a large eddy model (LEM), this study investigates the effects of surface pressure, surface sensible heat flux, surface wind and surface roughness on dust devil properties in the Qaidam Basin, which is located at the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. The results of this study indicate that the LEM is capable of capturing the detailed characteristics of dust devil vortices reported in previous observations. The analysis also revealed that the numbers and lifetime of dust devils increase with the surface pressure. As the surface sensible heat flux increases, dust devils tend to be more intense, accompanied by a slight decrease in lifetime and minor variations in diameter.A slight decrease in numbers is observed with increasing surface sensible heat flux. This is likely because large surface sensible heat flux reduces the convective ratio (w⁎/u⁎) and significantly enhances turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) dissipation in the near-surface layer, which does not favor the formation of dust devils. With the intensification of surface winds, the number of dust devils notably reduces, which is associated with the decrease in w⁎/u⁎ and the temperature lapse rate (LR). Furthermore, as the surface wind increases, the cellular convection tends to involve convective rolls, which hinders the formation of dust devils. Finally, our analysis reveals that the tilting angles of dust devils increase with increasing surface roughness."

 Experiments were performed at the Mainz vertical wind tunnel where two types of drop breakup were investigated with freely floating drops. Spontaneous breakup under laminar conditions resulted in 5 % breakup events of drops with equivalent diameters between 8 and 13 mm by separating in the center due to strong oscillations in horizontal mode into two nearly equal sized fragments. In a turbulent airflow, several oscillation types mainly in vertical and transverse directions caused significant deformations of the drops, which seemed to promote the coherence of the drops. Collision-induced breakup occurs when two drops collide and break up into several fragments. To fill the gaps of missing drop sizes in earlier measurements, a set of relevant drop pairs with diameters of 4.0 to 5.2 mm and 1.9 to 3.1 mm was investigated. With a mean breakup efficiency of 0.55, approximately half of breakup events resulted in two or three fragments, the other half in the formation of more than 3 up to 9 fragments. The measured fragment size distributions were compared to results from earlier parameterizations so that modifications due to the new data set were identified. Accompanying the experiments, process studies with a 3D cloud model were performed to study the impact of breakup on drop size distributions and precipitation. It was found that breakup reduces the numbers of the largest raindrops, thereby delays the onset of precipitation, possibly reduces total precipitation amounts and changes the local distribution of precipitation. Important parameters in the process studies were the breakup efficiency as well as the fragment numbers and sizes."

We found that α-2,3-sialyltransferases ST3GAL1 and ST3GAL2 and corresponding α-2,3–linked sialosides are up-regulated in melanoma compared to nevi and are essential for melanoma growth.

Owing to its human tropism, mechanisms that enabled the rise of USA300 as a major skin pathogen remain incompletely defined. By leveraging a rodent-adapted strain ofS. aureus, we developed a natural model of SSTIs. We found that LukMF′, a pore-forming leukocidin homolog to the human-specific LukSF-PV toxin, drives skin pathology in mice. LukMF′ lyses neutrophils via the chemokine receptor CCR1, which in turn fuels inflammatory pathology and microbial survival within the infectious nidus. Ablation of CCR1, depletion of neutrophils, or vaccination with LukMF′ all protected mice from skin pathology. Thus, these data support epidemiological studies linking leukocidins with human SSTIs and highlight the power of natural models to unearth potential targets to curtail infections."

Amyloid-β, the main component of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer’s disease, has been shown to be generated in the presence of microbes. Entrapment of microbes by aggregated amyloid-β may serve as an innate immune response to pathogenic infections. To understand the association of amyloid-β plaques and pathogenic infections in the central nervous system, we obtained viable short-interval postmortem human retinal tissue and generated human retinal organoids that contain electrophysiologically active neurons. Here, we demonstrate that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces amyloid-β extracellular protein aggregates in human retinal explants and retinal organoids. Last, pharmacological inhibition of neuropilin-1 resulted in reduced amyloid-β deposition in human retinal explants treated with SARS-CoV-2 Spike 1 protein.

The antiviral role of RNAi in mammalian cells remains controversial while a number of viral suppressors of RNAi (VSR) able to inhibit Dicer activity and promote infection have been identified. Here, we explored the integrity and functional role of Dicer during FMDV infection. These studies showed that the FMDV-encoded Leader protease (Lpro) specifically cleaves Dicer at a conserved DExD/H helicase motif releasing the complete N-terminal helicase domain. Dicer cleavage by Lpro suppressed small hairpin RNA (shRNA)–induced RNAi in swine cells. Silencing of Dicer conferred increased susceptibility to an Lpro-deficient FMDV, revealing a Dicer-dependent antiviral effect which can be effectively counteracted by Lpro. This mutant generated a remarkably different profile of viral small RNAs (vsRNAs) in infected cells compared with the wild-type virus.

Here, we show that oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) impairment, modeled byNdufs4deficiency, reprograms lung epithelial metabolism to promote IAV pathogenesis. In bothNdufs4knockout (KO) mice and lung epithelial cells, OXPHOS deficiency increased glycolytic flux, diverting carbons into hexosamine and de novo sialic acid (SIA) biosynthesis pathways. This led to elevated sialylation and enhanced viral attachment. InNdufs4KO models, adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase signaling was insufficient to blunt this increased metabolic flux. IAV infection further exacerbated this metabolic vulnerability, amplifying SIA and viral burden. Pharmacologic rerouting of glucose carbons with dichloroacetate reduced sialylation, viral replication, and inflammatory responses inNdufs4KO models. These findings reveal that mitochondrial dysfunction enhances IAV susceptibility by disrupting energy sensing and fueling viral receptor biosynthesis, highlighting the importance of epithelial metabolism in viral pathogenesis and suggesting metabolic modulation as a potential therapeutic."

The mechanical and hydrological effects of these incoming PFSs on subduction zones are potentially substantial. Here, we investigate their effects following transport into the accretionary wedge by integrating discrete-element modeling with three-dimensional seismic interpretation. We find that the typical dips of the incoming PFSs overlap with modeled dips prone to reactivation and confirm that subducting PFSs can be reactivated and gradually evolve into major thrust faults. Comparisons with electromagnetic data indicate that PFSs may provide conduits for fluid leakage along the plate interface, coincide with disrupted strata and decreased shear stress, and enhance geometric and stress heterogeneity along the megathrust. These suggest that PFSs may play a previously unrecognized role in contributing to shallow slow earthquake phenomena in subduction zones."

Here, we engineer photobiocatalytic artificial cells that modulate hepatocyte metabolism through alleviating alcohol-induced oxidative stress. These artificial cells feature nano-organelles that segregate incompatible modules: one for photocatalytic cofactor regeneration and another for biocatalytic alcohol metabolism. This spatial separation ensures sustainable cofactor provision and protects enzymes from oxidative damage. Co-compartmentalization of alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase within a single nano-organelle enhances cascade reaction efficiency while inhibiting intermediate leakage. When cocultured with hepatocytes, these artificial cells demonstrate excellent biocompatibility and efficiently mitigate oxidative stress from alcohol metabolism.

The Rab11 family (Rab11a, Rab11b, and Rab25) controls the return of internalized cargos to the plasma membrane, and Rab25 has been implicated in the aggressiveness of cancer by promoting invasive migration. However, while Rab25 vesicles distribute to the leading edge of moving cells, how directly they contribute to cell protrusion is not clear. Here, we adopt a magnetogenetic approach that allows direct manipulation of Rab25 positioning to show that localization to the cell periphery drives the formation of F-actin protrusions. We demonstrate that endogenous Rab25 vesicles coordinate the positioning of key cargos, including the actin regulator FMNL1 and integrin β1, with the activation of Rho guanosine triphosphatases at the plasma membrane to generate and maintain F-actin–rich filopodium-like protrusions and promote cancer cell invasive migration in the three-dimensional matrix."

Mesotrypsin, implicated in cancer progression, exemplifies these difficulties; no current inhibitors achieve selectivity over other human trypsins. We found an unexpected autoinhibited conformation of mesotrypsin via x-ray crystallography, revealing a cryptic pocket adjacent to the active site. Using high-throughput virtual screening targeting this cryptic pocket, we identified a conformationally selective small-molecule inhibitor that stabilizes the inactive state of mesotrypsin. This inhibitor demonstrates selectivity for mesotrypsin over other trypsins. Our findings challenge the accepted view of digestive trypsins as constitutively active enzymes lacking potential for allosteric regulation. Furthermore, analyses of other structures suggest that dynamic sampling of closed states with analogous allosteric cryptic pockets appears widespread among S1 serine proteases. These observations point to a potentially generalizable strategy to achieve selective inhibition, offering broad implications for drug development targeting serine proteases in cancer and other diseases."

Here, we describe a rhodopsin group found in microorganisms from cold environments, such as glaciers, denoted as CryoRhodopsins (CryoRs). A distinguishing feature of the group is the presence of a buried arginine residue close to the cytoplasmic face. Combining single-particle cryo–electron microscopy and x-ray crystallography with rhodopsin activation by light, we demonstrate that the arginine stabilizes an ultraviolet (UV)–absorbing intermediate of an extremely slow CryoRhodopsin photocycle. Together with extensive spectroscopic characterization, our investigations on CryoR1 and CryoR2 proteins reveal mechanisms of photoswitching in the identified group. Our data suggest that CryoRs are sensors for UV irradiation and are also capable of inward proton translocation modulated by UV light."

Heteroresistance occurs when a predominantly susceptible bacterial population harbors a rare resistant subpopulation. During antibiotic exposure, these resistant bacteria can be selected and lead to treatment failure. Standard antibiotic susceptibility testing methods often fail to reliably detect these subpopulations due to their low frequency, highlighting the need for improved diagnostic approaches. Here, we present a droplet microfluidics method where bacteria are encapsulated in droplets containing growth medium and antibiotics. The growth of rare resistant cells is detected by observing droplet shrinkage under microscopy. We validated this method for three clinically important antibiotics inEscherichia coliisolates obtained from bloodstream infections and showed that it can detect resistant subpopulations as infrequent as 10−6using only 200 to 300 droplets.

The MD-FET enables a perfect off state, as the elastic tunneling is forbidden by the momentum mismatch between the cross 1D contacts. It can also access a substantial on state, because the momentum mismatch can be compensated by the electron-phonon scattering in a 2D channel. The MD-FET with sub–1-nm channel thus exhibits high on/off ratios of ~107, which breaks through the theoretical limit on the short-channel effect.

Results indicate that extreme heat reduces milk yield by up to 10%, with effects that persist for more than 10 days.

While their occurrence has historically been attributed primarily to anthropogenic sources, growing evidence indicates that substantial natural HOC are stored in terrestrial ecosystems. As an enigmatic pool of soil organic matter, the molecular diversity of soil HOC remains largely unknown. Here, we establish a method to differentiate the speciation and molecular characteristics of soil extractable HOC using (ultra)high-resolution mass spectrometry, optimized through sample extraction solvents and cleanup strategies. Analyzing soil samples from six forest sites across eastern China, we revealed that natural HOC were present in both organic- and water-extractable fractions in all samples, comprising 0.2–14.4% of the total signal abundance. Lipid- and protein-like compounds were more abundant in organic-extractable HOC, while lignin- and lipid-like compounds dominated water-extractable HOC. Furthermore, distinct molecular characteristics were found among the two terrestrial-derived HOC fractions and disinfection byproducts (DBP) commonly detected in aquatic systems, with increasing oxidation and aromaticity, along with decreasing saturation and biolability. We propose a conceptual model describing the divergent molecular properties of natural terrestrial HOC and anthropogenic DBP across the soil–water interface, providing new insights into the different origins and fate of these HOC pools."

Herein, a new strategy is proposed to achieve simultaneous pollutant removal and Ag recovery in an expanded water self-purification system based on Mo–SnS2 quantum dots (MSS QDs) with dual-reaction-center (DRC). The innovative discovery is that the electrons of pollutants are finally utilized by Ag+ and dissolved oxygen through the constructed interfacial process without any sacrificial agent or additional energy consumption. Especially for antibiotics, one of the typical emerging contaminants (ECs), the degradation rate reaches 100% in a very short time. In N2 environment, the Ag recovery rate even reaches 94%.

We develop a novel framework to dynamically monitor the wetting progression of hydrophobic MD membranes and quantitatively describe the wetting status changes by implementing four-electrode mode electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). We decouple the membrane impedance into resistance and capacitance components, which are then translated into air gap span and wetted pore fractions. Distinguishing the wetting progression and the occurrence of pore breakthroughs, this framework successfully depicts the disparate wetting patterns of hydrophobic membranes induced by surfactants and low-surface-tension liquids. We show that the ability to instantaneously capture the wetting progression makes our framework particularly attractive for MD operations accompanied by slow wetting. EIS applied in our framework further reveals that a membrane of a randomly porous structure incurs a stepwise wetting front advancing by low-surface-tension liquids, as opposed to the single pore breakthrough event in the membrane of straight pores. Combined with the internal surface area and the pore size analyses, this illustration by EIS is used to model a randomly porous membrane as tortuous pores with multiple ‘necks’ of local minimum pore sizes."

This study is the first to uncover the inherent mechanisms of the enhancing effects of humic acid (HA) on the UVA/PI process. Accelerated degradation of the model compound naproxen (NAP) and six other structurally diverse compounds was observed, with enhancement factors of first-order rate constants varying from 1.2 to 5.5 in the presence of 2 mgC/L HA. The excited triplet of HA (3HA*), generated from HA photolysis, was identified as the dominant intermediate, and it reacts rapidly with PI at a diffusion-controlled second-order rate constant of about 1.19 × 109 M–1s–1. This interaction led to the generation of the hydroxyl radical (•OH) and ozone (O3), with •OH as the predominant oxidant responsible for over 70% of NAP degradation. Aromatic ketone moieties within HA were potential triplet candidates, as suggested by the model triplet sensitizer. Additionally, Suwannee River natural organic matter (SRNOM) was found to similarly enhance the performance of the UVA/PI process, indicating that this effect may extend to other natural organic matter sources. This study offers a novel perspective on PI-based advanced oxidation processes, revealing that HA can serve as an in situ enhancer to drive pollutant degradation with reduced reliance on chemical activators.

In particular, the latest CD scheme with larger surface drag coefficient at wind speeds less than 45 m s−1 yields higher surface stress and stronger boundary‐layer convergence in the outer core, thereby enhancing rainband convection and triggering earlier formation of a more coherent secondary eyewall structure compared to the scheme with smaller, nearly constant CD at wind speeds greater than 45 m s−1.

Global warming increases heatwaves frequency, affecting sources and sinks of Mgly. Thus, studies on Mgly observations during heatwaves become increasingly urgent. Here, we combined field measurements using Vocus proton transfer reaction time‐of‐flight mass spectrometry (Vocus PTR‐ToF‐MS), box model, and the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF‐Chem) to investigate the impacts of heatwaves on Mgly at a suburban site in eastern China during a prolonged heatwave influenced summer in 2022. After verifying that Vocus PTR‐ToF‐MS accurately detects Mgly and eliminating ion fragmentation artifacts of isoprene, we discovered that the heatwave doubled Mgly concentrations. This was attributed to a significant rise of isoprene—the dominant precursor of Mgly as confirmed by box modeling. The heatwave also altered photolysis and oxidation of Mgly and emission characteristics of isoprene, leading to an earlier peak and then a sudden drop of Mgly in the morning. This was different from the consistent peaks with air temperatures observed during non‐heatwave period. The concentrations of Mgly and isoprene showed positive correlations with air temperatures below 33°C, whereas both species' concentrations decline as temperatures exceeded 35°C. Additionally, WRF‐Chem underestimated isoprene and slightly overestimated Mgly. It could not capture the trends of Mgly and the discrepancies between model and measurements exacerbated when heatwave occurred.

Understanding natural carbon cycle responses to climate change is crucial for emission reduction strategies. We use the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model, driven by the Adaptive Emission Reduction Approach (AERA), to assess emission pathways for limiting global warming to 2°C and 3°C relative to preindustrial levels, while accounting for frozen soil carbon (FSC). We found that thawing FSC makes 122 PgC under 2°C and 229 PgC under 3°C warming, available for decomposition with about 75% reaching the atmosphere as carbon‐dioxide by 2298. Emission pathways that include the release of FSC diverge from their respective reference simulations without permafrost between the middle (2°C) and end (3°C) of the current century. By 2298, remaining carbon budgets are reduced by ∼13% (115 PgC) for 2°C and ∼11% (156 PgC) for 3°C stabilization levels. Annual permafrost emissions average ∼0.7 PgC/yr for 3°C and ∼0.3 PgC/yr for 2°C during the simulation period (2025–2298). However, temporary emission peaks reaching half of present‐day annual fossil fuel emissions (∼5 PgC) are possible. Surprisingly, while negative emissions are required for both reference simulations, only the simulation for the 3°C warming, accounting for FSC, requires negative fossil fuel emissions. This occurs because the FSC release causes an earlier initiation of emission reduction by AERA, resulting in a smoother emission curve. These findings underscore the importance of factoring in carbon released from permafrost thaw in mitigation action."

We assessed the global dengue transmission potential and suitable months under future climate scenarios by integrating the mosquito‐borne virus suitability index (Index P) with temperature and humidity projections from 12 global climate models. A substantial expansion of dengue risk zones from tropical to temperate regions was projected. The magnitude and pace of dengue risk escalation in China and the U.S. far exceed other temperate regions, with a considerable increase in at‐risk population and exposed land areas. In contrast, Europe exhibits a more delayed and moderate increase in dengue risk. In the SSP245 scenario for the 2050s, high dengue suitability zones are prominently located in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and sub‐Saharan Africa with emergent areas in southern North America and East Africa. By 2100, these zones expand to southern China and northern Australia. Under the SSP585 high‐emission scenario, the global dengue risk landscape shifts dramatically, with extensive risk zones emerging in the southeastern United States, China, and southern Europe, while some tropical regions such as Brazil and India experience a notable decline in transmission suitability due to extreme heat stress.

Although Rx1day increased faster than Rx1event in the historical period, it is projected to grow more slowly than Rx1event in all three future scenarios. Both Rx1day and Rx1event exhibit Hook structures responding to temperature. The Peak temperatures of Hook structures are expected to rise by 2–6°C with projected future climate change, causing the precipitation‐temperature response curve to shift to the high‐value direction, thereby increasing the magnitude of Rx1day by 5%–12% and Rx1event by 22%–29%.

Climatic conditions significantly influence transmission dynamics. While temperature, precipitation, and humidity are known to affect mosquito populations and virus replication, wind speed is often neglected in transmission models despite its potential to alter mosquito behavior and facilitate mosquito dispersal. This study incorporates wind speed into climate‐based WNV models to compare its effects in Louisiana and South Dakota, two U.S. states with contrasting climates, land cover, and vector and host species. From 2004 to 2022, we analyzed weekly WNV human case data in relation to daily meteorological data. The relationships were modeled using logistic regression with distributed lag effects. Incorporating wind speed consistently enhanced the fit of climate‐based models across both states, as evidenced by the Akaike Information Criterion. Higher‐than‐normal wind speeds were associated with decreased WNV cases over specific lag periods, suggesting that increased wind speed may inhibit mosquito activity and reduce virus transmission. Differences in how temperature and moisture‐related variables influenced the two regions highlight the importance of considering regional climatic contexts. These findings demonstrate that incorporating wind speed can enhance meteorological models of mosquito‐borne diseases and reinforce the importance of considering a broader range of climatic factors beyond temperature and precipitation. Understanding these regional variations is essential for predicting local climatic influences on disease transmission, which can support the implementation of more targeted and effective public health strategies."

 Discovering governing equations of complex network dynamics is a fundamental challenge in contemporary science with rich data, which can uncover the hidden patterns and mechanisms of the formation and evolution of complex phenomena in various fields and assist in decision-making. In this work, we develop a universal computational tool that can automatically, efficiently, and accurately learn the symbolic patterns of changes in complex system states by combining the excellent fitting capability of deep learning with the equation inference ability of pre-trained symbolic regression.

Quintessential predictions emanating from this complexity employ the Fibonacci string net condensate (Fib SNC) and its anyons: sampling Fib-SNC would estimate chromatic polynomials while exchanging its anyons would implement universal quantum computation. However, physical realizations remained elusive. We introduce a scalable dynamical string net preparation (DSNP) that constructs Fib SNC and its anyons on reconfigurable graphs suitable for near-term superconducting processors. Coupling the DSNP approach with composite error-mitigation on deep circuits, we create, measure, and braids Fibonacci anyons; charge measurements show 94% accuracy, and exchanging the anyons yields the expected golden ratio ϕ with 98% average accuracy. We then sample the Fib SNC to estimate chromatic polynomial at ϕ + 2 for several graphs. Our results establish the proof of principle for using Fib-SNC and its anyons for fault-tolerant universal quantum computation and aim at a classically hard problem. Topological quantum states can power fault-tolerant computing and solving classically hard problems.

 The ring-opening addition of bicyclo[1.1.0]-butanes (BCBs) represents a straightforward and efficient strategy for the synthesis of polyfunctionalized cyclobutanes, which are crucial scaffolds in pharmaceuticals and drug candidates. Despite their significance, regiodivergent addition reactions of BCBs have not been previously reported.

 Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) define the surface biology of Gram-negative bacteria, with roles in adhesion, transport, catalysis and signalling. Specifically, porin beta-barrels are common diffusion channels, predominantly monomeric/trimeric in nature. Here we show that the major OMP of the bacterial predator Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, PopA, differs from this architecture, forming a pentameric porin-like superstructure. Our X-ray and cryo-EM structures reveal a bowl-shape composite outer β-wall, which houses a central chamber that encloses a section of the lipid bilayer. We demonstrate that PopA, reported to insert into prey inner membrane, causes defects when directed into Escherichia coli membranes. We discover widespread PopA homologues, including likely tetramers and hexamers, that retain the lipid chamber; a similar chamber is formed by an unrelated smaller closed-barrel family, implicating this as a general feature. Our work thus defines oligomeric OMP superfamilies, whose deviation from prior structures requires us to revisit existing membrane-interaction motifs and folding models.

In this study, a strain heterogeneity engineering strategy with single Pt atoms is used to enhance the activity and stability of RuO2 for the oxygen evolution reaction. 
 Developing acid-stable and active ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for facilitating the large-scale applications of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) for hydrogen production. Here, we propose a strain heterogeneity engineering strategy to simultaneously enhance the OER stability and activity of RuO2 electrocatalysts by introducing single-atom platinum (Pt). In a PEM water electrolyzer, the resultant Pt-RuO2 catalyst archives 3 A cm−2 at a low voltage of 1.791 V and maintains a stable performance for over 500 h at 500 mA cm−2. These performance metrics highlight its potential for practical applications. Experiments and calculations analyses confirm that the bulk tensile strain effectively stabilizes the entire structure of electrocatalysts, while the regions of compressive strain are identified as highly active catalytic sites, where the weakened binding energy of oxo-intermediates improves the catalytic activity. Efficient and stable catalysts are essential for advancing proton exchange membrane water electrolysis.

By using a consistent source apportionment tool for all datasets, the study enhances the comparability of PM10 SA results across urban Europe. The results identified seven major PM10 sources including road traffic, biomass burning, crustal/mineral sources, secondary aerosols, industrial emissions, sea salt, and heavy oil combustion (HOC). Road traffic emerged as the predominant source of PM10 in urban areas, with contributions varying by location, but representing as much as 41% in high-traffic zones. Biomass burning was detected at 23 sites, contributing 8% to 41% on yearly averages, with substantial increase in winter. Crustal sources were present at all sites (3–33%). Industrial sources contributed relatively less PM10 mass, which was identified at 10 sites with contributions ranging from 2% to 14%. Secondary inorganic and organic aerosol, consisting primarily of ammonium nitrates and sulfates, and organic matter, formed a portion of the PM10 mass (5–41%). These secondary factors are primarily influenced by anthropogenic emissions, including the various combustion processes. Sea salt, predominantly found in coastal areas, contributed between 4% and 21%, reflecting the impact of the marine environments on air quality. This source was very often ‘aged’ (mixed with anthropogenic pollutants from different origins). Additionally, HOC, especially emits from shipping activities, and traced by V and Ni, was also a frequent contributing source (2–15% for 9 sites), indicating a need for more stringent emission controls. The chemical comparison is performed which indicates road traffic and secondary aerosols, showed consistent chemical profiles across sites, while industrial, HOC, and crustal sources displayed significant site-specific variability. These findings underscore the need for tailored air quality strategies according to local sources of emissions and the importance of long-term PM speciation monitoring for effective pollution control."

 The Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (ca. 183 million years ago) marks a global mass extinction coincident with dramatic changes in climate and ocean circulation, likely driven by large igneous province emplacement. Rapid carbon dioxide release may have induced global warming, widespread ocean deoxygenation, and ocean acidification. To constrain the magnitude of ocean acidification, we present boron isotope data from three different carbonate components, lime mud (micrite), brachiopods, and bivalves, from two marine sections in SW Europe. Only data from micrite shows a temporary decrease in boron isotope composition during the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event, recording an ocean acidification event, which we reproduce using a coupled biogeochemical model. The contrasting stability of boron isotope values shown by bivalves and brachiopods suggests that the investigated taxa may have been able to physiologically buffer changes in ocean pH, and are therefore poor targets for the interrogation of pH changes in Earth history.

 Temporarily impounded liquid water on the surface of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS), prominently represented as supraglacial lakes (SGLs), may enhance ice flow and modulate surface meltwater runoff, serving as a dynamic indicator of the cryohydrologic cycle. Despite their importance in understanding glacier mass balance and regional climate change, a detailed description of SGLs and their intra-annual fluctuations across the entire GrIS remains understudied. Here, we present a deep learning-based approach to automatically map SGLs from passive optical satellite imagery across the entire GrIS during the melt seasons of 2017–2022. Approximately 150,000 Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9 images were utilized, each representing a 5-day average composite at a 10 km × 10 km grid resolution, with the Landsat images used as possible supplements. SGL predictions by the proposed method demonstrate high performance, achieving an F1-score of up to 0.959 compared to the independent test dataset. This high accuracy enables a detailed analysis of the key role SGLs play in enhancing surface ablation by absorbing solar radiation and delivering meltwater. The SGL-driven ablation effect was most pronounced in the South-West basin of the GrIS, where the peak lake area in July accounted for 44.9 % of the total GrIS-wide lake area. In contrast, the lowest magnitude (4.2 %) was observed in the South-East basin, despite similarly strong ablation in this region. Among all the generated SGL occurrence grids, peak SGL areas in certain grids (∼14 % of the total) were observed in May or September, rather than exclusively during the typical high-ablation months of June to August, reflecting regional and elevation-dependent variations. Grids further from the ice sheet margin generally showed peak SGL areas later in the melt season, which is evident in the western part of the GrIS. Monthly SGL peak areas shift dramatically from 253.18 ± 123.94 km2 to 5084.90 ± 1043.26 km2, with the lowest in May 2018 and the highest in August 2021. An extraordinary area spike occurred in September 2022 and was particularly monitored in the South-West basin, where abnormally intense rainfall and runoff simulated by the Modèle Atmosphérique Régional (MAR) model were recorded.

 Flash droughts cause serious damage to ecosystems and human societies due to their rapid onset and intensification. Their fast changes pose significant challenge to existing drought warning and monitoring systems. Although previous studies have focused on meteorological, ecological and soil moisture indicators for assessing flash droughts, an effective quantitative indicator capturing the direct manifestation of flash droughts—specifically, the rapid decline in terrestrial water storage (TWS)—remains unavailable. To address this gap, we propose a pentad-scale hydrological flash drought identification framework based on a daily-scale reconstructed TWS anomaly dataset derived from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) observations. We further analyze global flash drought hotspot regions, their spatiotemporal evolution, and key drivers from 1979 to 2018. Our findings reveal that, on a spatial scale, flash drought hotspots are primarily concentrated in humid and semi-humid climate zones. On a temporal scale, the impact of flash droughts has intensified in regions such as Northern Europe, Northern Asia, Southeast Asia, and South Asia, whereas the Amazon, East Africa, and West Africa exhibit a decreasing trend. In other study regions, no significant changes in flash drought conditions are observed. At the global scale, energy-related factors (including temperature and solar radiation) contribute significantly more to flash drought development than water-related factors (such as precipitation). Additionally, approximately 48 % of flash droughts worldwide evolve into long-term droughts, with this transition occurring primarily during the vegetation growing season in humid regions. The hydrological flash drought identification framework proposed in this study effectively addresses gaps in existing monitoring systems, providing a crucial scientific basis for drought early warning and disaster mitigation."

 Heterogeneous environments and low Signal-to-Clutter Ratio (SCR) pose a challenge for Infrared Small Target Detection (IRSTD). Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is constrained by the global view. Transformer with quadratic computational complexity struggles for local feature refinement. Inspired by the quad-directional scanning State Space Model (SSM) with linear complexity for long-range modeling, this research reconceptualizes the spatial and structural information of small targets in IR images. Multi-granularity features and long-range dependency of small targets are considered simultaneously. Specifically, we tailor a nested structure with cross-fertilization of global and local information. Each layer of the top-level pyramid network embeds a tiny well-configured contextual pyramid block to extract fine-grained features of small targets. The following Mamba module restructures the feature maps to derive coarse-grained features of “visual sentences”. The fusion of contextual information and local feature achieves precise localization of small targets. Furthermore, we propose the Asymmetric Convolution (AConv) for substituting the Depthwise Convolution (DWConv) in the Visual State Space (VSS) module and the regular convolution in each lateral connection of the nested pyramid network to alleviate the parameters and computation.

 Thermal infrared hyperspectral images (TIR-HSIs) provide unique spectral insights that are often unattainable with visible imagery, making them invaluable for applications such as land cover classification and geological mapping. However, the high spectral redundancy in TIR-HSIs often leads to increased computational complexity and potential performance degradation. To address this issue, this paper proposed an unsupervised temperature–emissivity–driven band selection method (TEBS) for TIR-HSIs classification, which integrated a structured state-space model (SSM) and a gated attention mechanism (GAM). Specifically, a feature extraction (FE) module is firstly designed to separate land surface temperature (LST) and land surface emissivity (LSE) information, incorporating superpixel segmentation to extract multi-scale LST features. Subsequently, a weight computation (WC) module, leveraging SSM and GAM, is developed to generate robust band weights by sequentially leveraging multi-scale LST features. Finally, a band evaluation (BE) module is employed to assess the band selection results and optimize the model parameters. Experimental comparisons conducted on two datasets using four classic classifiers show that TEBS framework outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in classification accuracy. These results underscore the potential of TEBS to advance land cover classification in thermal infrared hyperspectral imaging.

 The 31st Summer Edition of the FISU World University Games took place in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China from July 27nd to August 8th, 2023. To ensure optimal air quality during this event, a series of control measures were implemented, providing a unique opportunity to assess the impact of reduced anthropogenic volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions on ozone (O3) mitigation. A comprehensive field campaign was conducted at an urban supersite in Chengdu, spanning both the pre-control period (July 1st −21st) and the control period (July 22nd-August 8th). To reflect the emission features of primary pollutants, the photochemical initial concentrations of VOCs (In-VOCs) were calculated and their sources were identified by applying receptor model. During the control period, the average mixing ratio of In-VOCs (comprising 57 species) was 22.7 ppbv, reflecting a 17 % reduction compared to the pre-control period. Source apportionment identified four key anthropogenic VOC sources: industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, gasoline evaporation, and solvent use. The largest reduction was observed in solvent utilization (48.9 %). The observation-based box model, configured with the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM-OBM), was used to quantify the impact of VOC reductions from each source on O3 concentrations. The most significant reduction in daily maximum 8-h O3 concentrations was achieved by controlling traffic sources (vehicle and gasoline evaporation emissions), resulting in a decrease of 11.9 μg/m3, followed by reductions from industrial emissions (8.9 μg/m3) and solvent utilization (2.4 μg/m3). Our results indicate that a modest, scientifically justified reduction in VOC levels can significantly contribute to O3 pollution mitigation, providing valuable insights for summer urban air quality management."

 A comprehensive field campaign was conducted during the wet season of 2019 in urban Dongguan, South China, to investigate the evolution of particle number concentrations during rainfall events. Size-resolved particle number concentrations (4.7–10,000 nm), classified into nucleation mode (NUC), Aitken mode (AIT), accumulation mode (ACC), and coarse mode (CM), were measured to estimate below-cloud scavenging (BCS) coefficients (estimated Λ) from 53 rainfall events by comparing particle number concentrations before and during rainfall for each event. Among these, 36 % (19 events) exhibited positive estimated Λ values across all modes, 19 % (10 events) showed negative values, and 45 % (24 events) displayed mixed positive/negative values. Estimated Λ values for CM particles were consistent with theoretical estimates, while those for NUC, AIT, and ACC particles were approximately an order of magnitude higher. During the 19 rainfall events with positive estimated Λ values, a weak positive correlation was observed between rainfall intensity (RI) and the average estimated Λ across all modes, while stronger correlations emerged during rainfall events coinciding with new particle formation (NPF), where RI and estimated Λ were highly correlated (R2 = 0.93, p < 0.05). In these cases, estimated Λ for NUC, AIT, and ACC particles were at least 1.7 times those in other rainfall events. This enhancement is largely attributed to rainfall interfering with concurrent NPF processes, which reduces the formation and growth of new particles and amplifies the decline in particle number concentrations. As a result, Λ values derived from observational data may be inflated, independent of actual wet scavenging. Additional non-rainfall factors, such as air mass transport and local emissions, also contributed to the variability. These findings underscore that non-rainfall influences, by altering ambient particle concentrations, can significantly bias Λ estimation and offer new insights into interpreting apparent BCS behavior."

 Bisphenol A (BPA) and its analogues (BPs) are widely used in the chemical industry and increasingly detected in various environmental media. However, their occurrence and behavior in airborne fine particulate matter (PM2.5) remain poorly understood, particularly in industrially intensive regions. This study investigates the concentrations, compositional profiles, seasonal variations, and potential sources of thirteen bisphenols in PM2.5 collected from a large chemical industrial park in Shanghai. Results revealed that BPA, bisphenol F (BPF) were the predominant congeners, accounting for over 90 % of thirteen bisphenols, with concentrations of Σ13BPs ranging from 15.705 to 6211.201 pg/m3 (mean: 957.781 pg/m3). Higher concentrations were observed during the cool season, coinciding with lower temperature, lower wind speed, and higher atmospheric pressure, which favored the accumulation of bisphenols on fine particles. Spearman correlation and principal component analysis indicated that BPA, BPF, bisphenol B (BPB), and bisphenol E (BPE) likely originate from shared industrial activities, primarily polycarbonate production, and were significantly associated with combustion-related pollutants (NOx, CO). The 24-h backward trajectory and concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) analyses indicate combined contributions from local emissions and regional transport. However, the influence of long-range transport remains uncertain and warrants further investigation. Human exposure assessment based on estimated daily intake (EDI) and hazard quotient (HQ) showed low risk through inhalation for both adults and children. Overall, this study highlights the need for attention to airborne bisphenols emissions from local sources and provides a scientific basis for environmental control and health risk management in chemical industrial zones."

 Precipitation spatial patterns significantly impact regional water resource management, agricultural production, and socioeconomic development. While conventional methods typically explain less than 80 % of total precipitation variability due to challenges in analyzing spatially heterogeneous rainfall data, this study introduces a novel dual-criterion framework integrating Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) with Rotated Empirical Orthogonal Function (REOF) to enhance pattern identification. Using meteorological station data (1951–2024) from the Middle-Lower Yangtze River Basin (MLYRB), we identified 11 homogeneous sub-regions and six dominant precipitation patterns explaining a notably high 85.1 % of total variance: basin-wide coherent (34.7 %), north-south dipole (18.6 %), western dominant (11.3 %), lower reaches dominant (8.0 %), and two tripole patterns (12.4 % combined). The basin-wide pattern, occurring most frequently (31 years), dominated historical catastrophic floods (1954, 1998, 2020). Circulation analysis revealed a distinctive tripole structure in the 500 hPa geopotential height field driving the basin-wide pattern, while anticyclonic circulation anomalies characterized the north-south dipole pattern. The positive phase of the basin-wide pattern features enhanced southwesterly moisture transport from tropical sources with peak convergence of −2.29 × 10−6 kg/(m 2·s) over the central Yangtze region, mechanistically explaining basin-wide precipitation increases. Wavelet coherence analysis uncovered a critical temporal shift in ENSO's influence on basin-wide precipitation from short (2–4 years) to long (8–12 years) periods since the 1960s, fundamentally transforming teleconnection impacts on major flood events. Concurrently, PDO maintains a robust decadal-scale relationship with lower Yangtze precipitation patterns throughout the entire study period, offering potential for reliable long-term predictability. These findings provide a scientific foundation for improving seasonal precipitation forecasting and regional water resource management under changing climate conditions."

 A warming climate is driving an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, including heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall. These events are increasingly occurring in rapid succession or simultaneously, creating compound effects that amplify their overall impact. Among these, Drought-Wet Abrupt Alternation events (DWAA) - rapid transitions between drought conditions and extreme wet periods (characterized by heavy precipitation) - are becoming more frequent. Northern China, spanning multiple climate subregions and strongly influenced by various monsoon systems, serves as a typical example of such events. Using 40 years of historical meteorological data (1980–2020), we examined the spatiotemporal patterns of DWAA across Northern China and identified the North China Plain and the Loess Plateau as primary hotspots. In comparison, drought-to-wet transitions (DTW) posed a higher risk level to Northern China than wet-to-drought transitions (WTD), characterized by generally more intense transition magnitudes and a more pronounced increasing trend in frequency over the past 40 years. Crucially, the Loess Plateau and northern North China Plain emerged as areas most severely affected, identified as high-frequency zones (recording eight or more events per decade) and high-risk areas for both DTW and WTD. Over 50 % of DTW occurred in summer, while nearly 80 % of WTD took place in summer and autumn—periods crucial for both agricultural productivity and ecosystem health. This seasonal concentration is driven by climate warming, which has intensified the concentration of precipitation and, in turn, heightened the severity of dry-wet transitions. Our research underscores the urgent need for improved disaster risk management, water resource planning, and climate adaptation strategies in these vulnerable regions."

Here, we develop a trifunctional choline chloride/glyoxylic acid (ChCl/GA) binary deep eutectic solvent with a π-π conjugate structure and moderate acidity for the fast isolation of light-colored lignin with near proto-structures (exceeding 88% of delignification ratio for 1 hour). The synergetic interaction of GA and ChCl substantially reduced Gibbs free energy of acetal reaction and thoroughly captured reactive intermediates, precisely activating the following key functions: stabilizing β-O-4 linkages, inhibiting condensation reaction, and shielding –OH groups. These enabled efficient isolation of uncondensed, abundant β-O-4 linkage (45.80/100 C9; 79% retention) and light-colored lignin.

We also apply our approach to high‐resolution atmosphere‐only models forced with SSTs modified to preserve historical variability but following projected warming over 2016–2050.

GRIST‐noCPS forecasts are also compared with those from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, using equivalent configurations (WRF‐noCPS) over the refined region. Compared to the WRF‐noCPS experiment, both spatial distributions and statistical metrics reveal that the GRIST‐NTDK, GRIST‐SAT, and GRIST‐noCPS experiments can capture the observed rainfall for a few days, although with some overestimation. Most of the rainfall overestimation from GRIST experiments is due to nocturnal rainfall bias, which is associated with excessive water vapor transport in the lower troposphere. Relative to GRIST‐NTDK and GRIST‐SAT, GRIST‐noCPS could somewhat alleviate the pressure gradients and southerly winds bias, favoring less severe overestimation. Although scale‐aware configurations of CPS can reduce light rainfall and increase heavy rainfall over the refined region to some degree, there are still some gaps between the GRIST‐SAT and observations in terms of rainfall frequencies. In contrast, GRIST‐noCPS can mitigate the widespread light rain, as exhibited in GRIST‐NTDK and GRIST‐SAT, resulting in improved quantitative precipitation forecast skills.

However, previous studies usually attributed this effect to human activities, and ignored the effect of climate changes, namely chain transmission effects via catchment characteristic alterations. This study proposes a novel assessment approach of runoff change to disentangle both direct and chain transmission effects by adopting nonlinear relationships between catchment characteristic parameters and multiple impact factors into the Budyko framework. Eight catchments in the arid and semi‐arid, semi‐humid, and humid climatic zones are selected as our study area. Results show that runoff in most catchments decreases, while catchment characteristic parameters increase, with slopes of −2.44 to 3.79 mm/year and −0.003 to 0.017/year, respectively. It indicates that more precipitation evaporates than that contributing to runoff due to the catchment characteristic alterations. These changes are the most significant in the semi‐humid zone, followed by those in the arid and semi‐arid zone. Annual temperature and precipitation, gross domestic product, industrial water use, and population are the main impact factors. The contributions of human activities to runoff changes are usually the largest (i.e., −62.9% to 72.0%), followed by the direct effects of climate change (i.e., −32.6% to 88.0%).

 The Mg-pyroxene annulus in the South Pole–Aitken (SPA) basin holds crucial information about the lunar crustal evolution, yet its mineralogy and origin remain debate. Here we analyzed the mineralogy, exogenic ejecta, and soil evolution of the 2.8-billion-year-old Chang’e-6 samples from the SPA basin by Raman spectroscopic technique. The Chang’e-6 soils contain mare basalts and noritic exogenous ejecta (31–40 vol%), likely from Chaffee S crater. The derived mineralogy (63–67 vol% plagioclase and 25–27 vol% low-Ca pyroxene) of Mg-pyroxene annulus indicates a ferrous noritic lithology, attributed to a mixture of differentiated norite from the SPA impact melt sheet and re-deposited SPA crust (61–63 vol%). Ejecta accumulation facilitated glass formation, while small impacts induced quartz metamorphism, mixing mature basaltic soil with fresh ejecta, and leading to the fine-grained CE-6 soil. These findings provide new insights into the origin of SPA mafic anomalies and farside mare soil evolution.

 Urban street trees account for a significant fraction of trees in urban areas, yet the amount and changes of their carbon stocks remain largely unexamined. This study introduces a framework utilizing a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-camera fusion-based Mobile Mapping System (MMS) to estimate carbon stocks in individual street trees regularly. This system allows repetitive and simultaneous collection of species information and structural parameters on a city-wide scale, enabling the estimation of carbon stock and its change. The framework comprises two principal components: the detection of individual street trees and the estimation of their respective carbon stocks. To detect individual street trees, we initially employed image-based deep learning model to diminish the effort needed in constructing point cloud training data and designing a universal rule applicable to complex and diverse urban streetscapes. In the carbon stock estimation phase, we used species-specific allometric equations based on species information derived from YOLOv3 and Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) measurements from trunk point cloud circle fitting. The proposed individual street tree detection method achieved an F1-score of 81.9 %, precision of 86.3 %, and recall of 78.5 % in city-scale experiments. Additionally, the Root Mean Square Error for the estimates of DBH and tree height (H) was 3.2 cm (11.4 %) and 1.8 m (18.3 %), respectively. Repeated acquisitions between two years revealed the median change of H, DBH, and carbon stock as 0.4 m yr−1, 1.4 cm yr−1, and 27.1 kgC yr−1, respectively. Applying our method in most vehicle accessible streets in Suwon, Republic of Korea, we mapped 34,124 street trees, revealing a total carbon stock of 6.18 GgC.

 Future climate projections of global climate models (GCMs) are widely used for climate change impact assessments. However, increasing available GCMs and computational constraints necessitate using a selected subset for such applications. The selection of the GCM subset is a critical step in climate change impact assessment, given the computational constraints and inherent uncertainties associated with climate projections. This review comprehensively evaluates existing GCM evaluation and selection methods, focusing on past performance, future projections, and hybrid approaches. It highlights the challenges in selecting GCMs due to varying resolutions, interpolation techniques, reference datasets, and the sensitivity of evaluation metrics. Traditional performance-based methods emphasize replicating historical climate, while envelope and advanced hybrid approaches integrate future projection consistency and past performance to address uncertainties. The review underscores the growing importance of multi-model ensembles (MMEs) in reducing projection uncertainties and enhancing the reliability of climate simulations. Advanced statistical techniques, including hierarchical clustering and divergence analysis, offer promising tools for addressing structural uncertainties and improving model evaluation. The study identifies key gaps, such as the need for standardized metrics, the integration of extreme event simulations, and the development of region-specific selection frameworks. Future research directions include leveraging machine learning techniques, expanding reference datasets, and incorporating stakeholder-driven criteria to refine GCM selection processes. By addressing these challenges, the study aims to enhance the robustness and applicability of GCM selection methodologies, contributing to more reliable climate projections and informed decision-making in climate adaptation and mitigation strategies."

This paper describes a dataset of grounding line discharge for the Antarctic Ice Sheet and each of its glaciers. The dataset shows that Antarctic Ice Sheet grounding line discharge has increased since 1996. 
 Grounding line discharge is a key component of the mass balance of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Here, we present a time-varying estimate of Antarctic Ice Sheet grounding line discharge, at up to monthly intervals, from 1996 through to November 2024. We calculate ice flux through 16 algorithmically generated flux gates across 998 ice sheet, glacier, ice stream and ice shelf drainage basins. We draw on a range of ice velocity and thickness data to estimate grounding line discharge. For ice thickness, we use three bed topography datasets, two firn models and a time-varying ice surface. For the ice velocity, we utilise a range of publicly available ice velocity maps at resolutions ranging from 200 m×200 m to 1000 m×1000 m, as well as new 100 m×100 m monthly velocity mosaics derived from intensity tracking of Sentinel-1 image pairs, available since October 2014.  Our dataset also includes the contributions to discharge from changes in ice thickness due to surface lowering, time-varying firn air content, and surface mass change between the flux gates and grounding line. We find that Antarctic Ice Sheet grounding line discharge increased from 1999±175 to 2224±200Gtyr-1 between 1996 and 2024, much of which was due to the acceleration of ice streams in West Antarctica but with substantial contributions from ice streams in East Antarctica and glaciers on the Antarctic Peninsula. The errors in our discharge dataset stem approximately equally from errors in the underlying ice velocity and thickness measurements. However, we find that the spread in possible discharge estimates depending on the choice of bed topography dataset and flux gate location is much larger than the error in any single estimate. It is our intention to update this discharge dataset each month, subject to continued Sentinel-1 acquisitions and funding availability.

Results from three southwest-type heavy rainfall cases in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region suggest the added forecast skill of ridge and foothill networks associated with the Taihang Mountains over the existing RWP network. This research provides valuable guidance for designing optimal RWP networks in the region. 
 The optimal spatial layout of a radar wind profiler (RWP) network for rainfall forecasting, especially over complex terrain, remains uncertain. This study explores the benefits of assimilating vertical wind measurements from various RWP network layouts into convective-scale numerical weather prediction (NWP) through Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs). Synthetic RWP data were assimilated into the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model using the National Severe Storms Laboratory three-dimensional variational data assimilation (DA) system for three southwest (SW)-type heavy rainfall events in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region. Four types of DA experiments were conducted and compared: a control experiment (CTL) that assimilates data solely from the operational RWP network and three additional experiments incorporating foothill (FH), ridge (RD), and combined foothill–ridge (FH_RD) RWP network layouts. A detailed examination of the 21 July 2023 case reveals that the FH_RD experiment generally exhibits more skillful storm forecasts in terms of areal coverage, storm mode, and orientation, benefiting from refined mesoscale wind analysis. Particularly, in the RD experiment, RWP data assimilation notably reduces wind errors and improves the representation of mesoscale atmospheric features near the Taihang Mountains upstream of Beijing, crucial for convective initiation (CI). Aggregated score metrics across all cases also indicate that both FH and RD experiments offer substantial added value over the operational network alone. Further sensitivity experiments on vertical resolution and maximum detection height indicate that the RWP system configuration with the highest detection height achieves the best performance, while lower detection height degrades forecast quality. These findings highlight the importance of strategic RWP network placement along the Taihang Mountains' ridge and foothill for short-term quantitative precipitation forecast in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region."

Despite their importance, a mechanistic and quantitative understanding of these processes under dynamic flow conditions remains elusive, particularly at the basin scale. In this study, we investigate the multiscale (site-to-basin) mechanisms governing methane emissions from riverbeds, focusing on the interplay between biogeochemical processes and hydrological dynamics. We developed a reactive transport model that integrates methane production with hydrodynamic and ebullitive pathways and coupled it with a basin-scale groundwater flow model to simulate methane emissions across scales. By incorporating key factors such as vertical hydrological exchange flow (VHEF), particulate organic carbon availability, sediment properties, and temperature sensitivity, our model captures the spatiotemporal variability of methane ebullition at both the site and basin scales. Our results reveal that methane ebullition is strongly modulated by VHEF, with lower flow rates promoting methane accumulation and subsequent ebullition. Sensitivity analyses underscore nonlinear responses of methane fluxes to environmental drivers. These findings emphasize the critical roles of sediment composition, hydrological exchange, and environmental conditions in shaping methane dynamics. Overall, this work advances our understanding of riverine methane emissions and offers insights for guiding climate models and mitigation strategies."

A major competitor binding to metal (hydr)oxides is natural organic matter (NOM). This study investigated the competitive binding between humic acids (HA) and PMG on goethite with batch adsorption experiments, varying pH, ionic strength, and HA surface loading. HA strongly decreases PMG adsorption, increasing its solution concentration by multiple orders of magnitude. Interpretation of the competitive adsorption data with the NOM-CD model revealed that site and electrostatic competition insufficiently explain the competition. The model can be greatly improved by introducing steric hindrance as an additional mechanism, requiring only a single adjustable parameter. At low pH, HA maximizes its interaction with the surface while at high pH, the ligands tend to move outward. Our model reveals that steric hindrance is most significant in acidic conditions, while in alkaline conditions, competition is primarily controlled by electrostatics. The steric NOM-CD model provides excellent predictions of the behavior of PMG competing with HA and provides a tool to describe the key role of NOM in assessing the availability, mobility, and risk of PMG in the environment."

However, information regarding the metabolic interactions and associated mechanisms during bioremediation remains scarce. This study used a bottom-up approach to illustrate how mutually beneficial cross-feeding relationships form and influence the degradation of recalcitrant organic pollutants. The synthetic bacterial consortium is comprised of a competent bacterial degrader, Rhodococcus sp. strain p52, and a nondegrader, Acinetobacter sp. BD6 that facilitates dibenzo-p-dioxin degradation. Strain p52 releases metabolic intermediates, such as catechol, during dibenzo-p-dioxin degradation, supporting the growth of strain BD6. Not only is strain BD6 able to compete with strain p52 for cytotoxic catechol consumption, but it is also able to secrete types of siderophores for increasing iron bioavailability that were beneficial to strain p52. The microbial consortium regulates the transcriptional activities of genes involved in dibenzo-p-dioxin catabolism and siderophore synthesis and transport in strains p52 and BD6, conferring a survival advantage. Thus, based on an externalized metabolic intermediate and shared siderophores, a mutualistic metabolic cross-feeding relationship is established between strains p52 and BD6.

However, the temporal relationships between these constituents remain unclear, as most field studies have relied on single-time snapshots and seldom examined the interplay between chemical and biological dynamics. We conducted a month-long spatiotemporal field study across 20 households in Hong Kong to investigate the factors influencing chemical and biological constituents on common indoor surfaces. Among the 16 household- and occupant-related factors analyzed, routine oil-based cooking was the primary driver of microbial diversity and composition on indoor surfaces. Surfaces in kitchens with frequent cooking exhibited elevated total organic carbon levels, which were linked to an increased bacterial abundance. A focused analysis of six kitchens with well-controlled frequencies of oil-based cooking revealed that cooking-derived organic compounds, particularly alkanes, promoted bacterial abundance while reducing microbial diversity. Network analysis further revealed strong interactions between these organic compounds and bacterial taxa, especially those within the Proteobacteria and Firmicutes phyla.

Although the neurotoxicity of TPHP to aquatic animals had been highlighted in previous studies, its effects on mammals, particularly at environmentally relevant doses (ERDs), have remained largely unknown. In this study, a 28-week mouse model was established to investigate the potential neurotoxicity induced by ERDs of TPHP (0.89 and 9.19 μg/kg/day). The mechanisms underlying gut–brain axis communication were explored using behavioral tests, 16S rRNA sequencing, and multiomics analysis. The results demonstrated that chronic exposure to an ERD of TPHP (9.19 μg/kg/day) significantly reduced the abundance of Lactobacillus in the gut microbiota of mice and led to an increase in pro-inflammatory bacterium. These alterations activated the NF-κB signaling pathway in the prefrontal cortex, resulting in the accumulation of quinolinic acid and glutamate. Ultimately, these changes induced anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in mice.

In this study, we investigated the aerosol hygroscopicity of ammonium sulfate (AS) and 2-methylglutaric acid (2-MGA) mixtures. 2-MGA is a moderately surface-active compound. Dilute surface tension measurements of 2-MGA/AS mixtures were taken by using a pendant drop goniometer. Hygroscopicity at subsaturated conditions was determined using a hygroscopicity tandem differential mobility analyzer (H-TDMA) and relative humidity was kept constant at 89 ± 0.9% RH. The droplet activation was also measured at supersaturated conditions using a cloud condensation nuclei counter (CCNC) from 0.4 to 1% supersaturation (SS). The single-hygroscopicity parameter κ was derived from measurements. Mixtures predominantly composed of AS, up to a 60 wt% 2-MGA, exhibit κ-values close to pure AS. However, κ decreases significantly as the organic fraction increases (>60 wt% 2-MGA). Previous predictions of κ-hygroscopicity assume full dissolution of both the organic and inorganic compounds. However, organic partitioning can influence the κ-hygroscopicity. A coverage-based parametrization, ϕ, assumes the probability of surface-active organics at the droplet surface. By estimation of the bulk and surface organic contribution, overall κ-hygroscopicity can be calculated. The model is computationally efficient, and the results indicate that organic solute depletion should be considered for fully soluble surface-active organics. Hygroscopicity predictions that account for the role of organic surface-active partitioning agree best with experimental results (R2 > 0.95). Therefore, this study helps to enhance our understanding of cloud-forming properties of complex chemical mixtures containing surface-active organic and inorganic compounds."

Environmental carcinogens induce mutations leading to tumors; pathogens relying on environmental media transmission cause infections; exposure to chemical or biological pollutants triggers toxicant poisoning. The mechanisms of xenobiotics work by abnormal expression of genes. Since their inception, genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout libraries have been rapidly applied in vitro to dissect the mechanism of diseases. Genome-wide screening of CRISPR/Cas9 knockout libraries has helped to identify genes essential for tumor survival, combinations of genes for synthetic lethal effects, and genes associated with drug resistance or susceptibility. In addition, key host factors and complex toxicological mechanisms of viral infection have been elucidated, contributing to the development of antidotes and the reduction of the incidence of adverse effects. CRISPR/Cas9 library screening can be combined with single-cell sequencing and organoid technologies to identify novel gene interactions and more reliable preclinical data. Future trends in such screening aim to identify more potential molecular targets for more exogenous pathogenic factors, combine screening with other emerging technologies to expand its use in in vitro models, and develop more accurate, accessible, and cost-effective genome editing tools."

Due to the relative abundance and complexity of overlying snow on sea ice, radar altimetry methods routinely deployed for sea ice thickness estimation in the Arctic are difficult to apply in Antarctica. We present nadir‐looking radar waveforms from the first deployment of the KuKa surface‐based radar on Antarctic sea ice, specifically multi‐year sea ice in the Weddell Sea marginal ice zone with a thick snow cover. Coincident snow pits revealed thick layers of snow which were exposed to the summer melt season and superimposed ice. Our instrument detects only very small amount of co‐polarized radar backscatter from the sea ice surface, suggesting that conventional satellite altimeters may not always range to this interface.

Both groups exhibit pronounced 8–20‐day variability, particularly in EATOFs, whereas SEATOFs demonstrate an additional 20–60‐day peak. The corresponding 8–20‐day atmospheric ISVs are focused on, which closely mirror the tropical quasi‐biweekly oscillation (QBWO) but differ in spatial structure. SEATOFs are tied to a zonally elongated, westward‐propagating QBWO (W‐QBWO), while EATOFs are linked to a west‐northward‐propagating QBWO (NW‐QBWO) with a slight southwest‐northeast tilt and intensified perturbations along the East Asian coast. Notably, EATOFs and their 8–20‐day ISV amplitude have concurrently increased since the late 1990s. This shift can be attributed to an interdecadal shift of QBWO dominance from W‐QBWO to NW‐QBWO. These results highlight the QBWO's substantial influence on TC activities across both Asian regions, particularly along the East Asian coast."

The relationship between late‐season WNP TC frequency and the PMM index has increased in recent decades. During 1951–1990, TC genesis is enhanced (suppressed) over the eastern (western) WNP during a positive PMM, due to the PMM's signal only extending from the subtropical northeastern Pacific to the eastern WNP. By contrast, during 1991–2023, a positive PMM leads to a basinwide enhancement of WNP TC genesis, due to PMM‐induced TC‐favorable environmental conditions expanding to the full WNP. This intensified PMM‐TC relationship is likely due to increased Intertropical Convergence Zone precipitation over the tropical eastern Pacific, which enhances northeasterly trade winds over the subtropical Pacific and subsequently strengthens the PMM."

Pronounced upward nutrient fluxes were observed within the deep chlorophyll maximum layer due to ITE‐induced mixing. Lateral transport directly influenced nutrient concentrations through isopycnal advection and indirectly by regulating the horizontal distribution of sinking particles. The latter likely induced spatial variability in mineralization, which played a dominant role in shaping nutrient enrichment.

However, for the plume head to penetrate the lithosphere and initiate removal of the lower lithospheric mantle, a deep‐seated zone of weakness beneath the MLD is required. This vertically oriented zone could be an inherited tectonic suture and/or a domain of pervasive percolation of plume‐derived melts and/or fluids. In the context explored here, where a long‐lived plume is continuously fed from below, the conditions for plume‐induced craton destabilization appear to be less stringent than earlier assumed, as it can occur even with a thin MLD (≤10 km) and a purely hydrous plume lacking an initial thermal component."

We propose to account for urban heterogeneities by applying multi‐layer division and the drag‐force approach jointly to urban canopies. The impact of urban heterogeneities is represented by vertical profiles of roughness density to form a physics‐based aerodynamic parameterization for real urban surfaces (denoted RUR). Evaluation over real urban surfaces shows that RUR generally outperforms the classical schemes, especially for the estimate of z0 ${z}_{0}$.

On monthly timescales, freshwater flux is the dominant driver of salinity variability in 11% of the global ocean. In an additional 35%, it remains the primary influence but is complemented by a substantial contribution from advection. At annual and longer timescales, the influence of freshwater flux diminishes in most regions but remains dominant in the polar regions, where a strong relationship between salinity and freshwater flux persists. These findings demonstrate how machine learning can uncover complex interactions between salinity and surface fluxes, providing a scalable framework to advance understanding of ocean‐climate interactions."

Covering over 70% of the Earth's surface, the ocean remains an underutilized resource for climate mitigation. Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) is one such strategy, designed to strengthen the ocean's natural carbon sink, reduce atmospheric CO2, and mitigate ocean acidification. However, its implications for fisheries, critical for food security and livelihoods, remain uncertain. This study examines the interplay between global fisheries, OAE, and different future socioeconomic and climatic conditions, using the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways framework. We explore how global fisheries and OAE could evolve under three combined scenarios: SSP1‐2.6 (sustainability‐focused), SSP3‐7.0 (regional rivalry), and SSP5‐8.5 (high fossil fuel dependency). By integrating ecological, economic, societal, and technological perspectives, we develop scenario narratives and quantify key bio‐economic parameters, including technological progress, fishing costs, fisheries management, marine aquaculture, and ecosystem carrying capacity. High‐emission (SSP5‐8.5) and fragmented development (SSP3‐7.0) scenarios present significant barriers to the coexistence of OAE and fisheries, whereas sustainability‐focused pathways (SSP1‐2.6) offer the most favorable conditions for their alignment. Successfully integrating OAE with fisheries management will likely depend on technological advancements, international cooperation, and socio‐economic developments. These scenarios are aligned with those used in model‐based scenario studies conducted under the frameworks of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), providing a shared foundation for future work."

To address these challenges, the Coupling Coordination Degree framework is employed to analyze the relationship between human activities and the environment. An adjusted ecosystem services (ES) matrix is used to calculate the supply, demand, and balance of potential ES and develops a human activity intensity index (HAII) that considers multiple factors, such as nighttime light and grazing intensity. By analyzing the spatiotemporal evolution of ES supply, demand, balance, HAII, and coordination degree from 2000 to 2020, this research provides insights into the evolution of coordinated human‐environmental development. Results indicate ES supply increased, but ES balance first improved and then declined. Meanwhile, HAII increased continuously, a bivariate local Moran's I test (−0.23) reveals a significant trade‐off between ES balance and HAII. Coupling Coordination analysis shows that over 86% of the region has a coordination degree below 0.7, indicating Barely Balanced Development. The most significant drop occurred in Tianjin, suggesting that intensified human activities may have contributed to the declining ES balance. Forests and grasslands account for over 88% of the cumulative contribution to ES balance. Scientific restoration of grasslands and maintenance of forest ecosystems are crucial for sustaining the human‐environment system in the JJJM region.

 Heatwaves are expected to both increase in frequency and duration under global warming. The probability distributions of heatwave durations are shaped by day-to-day correlations in temperature and so cannot be simply inferred from changes in the probabilities of daily temperature extremes. Here we show from statistical analysis of global historical and projected temperature data that changes in long-duration heatwaves increase nonlinearly with temperature. Specifically, from analysis informed by theory for autocorrelated fluctuations applied to European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) reanalysis and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) climate model simulations, we find that the nonlinearity results in acceleration of the rate increase with warming; that is, each increment of regional time-averaged warming increases the characteristic duration scale of long heatwaves more than the previous increment. We show that the curve for this acceleration can be approximately collapsed onto a single dependence across regions by normalizing by local temperature variability. Projections of future change can thus be compared to observations of recent change over part of their range, which supports the near-future-projected acceleration. We also find that the longest, most uncommon heatwaves for a given region have the greatest increase in likelihood, yielding a compounding source of nonlinear impacts.

 JAK (Janus Kinase) inhibitors, such as ruxolitinib, were introduced a decade ago for treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). To evaluate ruxolitinib’s impact on MPN clonal evolution, we interrogate a myelofibrosis patient cohort with longitudinal molecular evaluation and discover that ruxolitinib is associated with clonal outgrowth of RAS pathway mutations. Single-cell DNA sequencing combined with ex vivo treatment of RAS mutated CD34+ primary patient cells, demonstrates that ruxolitinib induces RAS clonal selection both in a JAK/STAT wild-type and hyper-activated context. RAS mutations are associated with decreased transformation-free and overall survival only in patients treated with ruxolitinib. In vitro and in vivo competition assays demonstrate increased cellular fitness of RAS-mutated cells under ruxolitinib or JAK2 knock-down, consistent with an on-target effect. MAPK pathway activation is associated with JAK2 downregulation resulting in enhanced oncogenic potential of RAS mutations.

To build our model, we sequence 3659 wastewater samples collected over two years from urban and rural locations in Southern Nevada. We then develop a multivariate independent component analysis (ICA)-based pipeline to transform mutation frequencies into independent sources. These data-driven time-evolving and co-varying sources are compared to 8810 SARS-CoV-2 clinical genomes from Nevadans. Our method accurately detects the Delta variant in late 2021, Omicron variants in 2022, and emerging recombinant XBB variants in 2023. Our approach also reveals the spatial and temporal dynamics of variants in both urban and rural regions; achieves earlier detection of most variants compared to other computational tools; and uncovers unique co-varying mutation patterns not associated with any known variant. The multivariate nature of our pipeline boosts statistical power and supports accurate early detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants. This feature offers a unique opportunity to detect emerging variants and pathogens, even in the absence of clinical testing. Wastewater surveillance can help in pandemic or outbreak response. Here, the authors report an unsupervised learning approach to detect emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants from rural and urban wastewater showing it achieves earlier detection than existing methods and detects new variants without clinical testing data."

 The molecular mechanisms underlying the transport of influenza A virus (IAV) membrane proteins to the cell surface remain largely unclear. In this study, siRNA screening identifies Rab27a as a critical host factor regulating this transport process. GTP-bound Rab27a operates via its effectors, synaptotagmin-like protein 1 (SYTL1) and SYTL4, to facilitate the transport of vesicles carrying viral membrane proteins to the plasma membrane. Absence of Rab27a or SYTL4 does not block the early stages of the IAV life cycle but restricts viral assembly and budding. Notably, silencing SYTL4 provides superior protection in the female mouse IAV infection model. This investigation elucidates the molecular mechanism by which Rab27a and its effectors modulate the transport of IAV membrane proteins, thereby bridging a critical gap in IAV life cycle research and presenting a potential target for the development of antiviral drugs.

Their quasiorder enables optical camouflage, concealing unclonable PUF keys within the background for secure, invisible authentication. 
 Quasi-order in structural coloration, as observed in nature, offers intrinsic, unclonable near-field stochastic fingerprints while preserving far-field uniform colors. However, replicating this balance in artificial photonic metasurfaces remains a major challenge. Here, we present plasmonic metasurfaces that achieve this balance through electrostatic self-assembly of quasi-ordered gold nanoparticles onto a dielectric-spaced metallic mirror. These metasurfaces enable precise tuning of far-field reflective colors across the visible spectrum by adjusting the dielectric gap thickness, while simultaneously generating stochastic near-field scattering patterns that serve as unique physically unclonable functions (PUFs). The resulting scattering PUF keys exhibit uniform bit uniformity (average: 0.501), high uniqueness (inter-Hamming distance: 0.496) and large capacity (~10260), with strong environmental stability and resistance to unauthorized cloning. We further demonstrate the practical applications of these plasmonic metasurfaces in security and authentication, including information camouflage and the integration of hidden PUF keys into identification cards and quick-response codes.

 In eukaryotes, the nucleocytoplasmic export of bulk poly(A)+-mRNAs through the nuclear pore complex is mediated by the ubiquitously expressed NXT1-NXF1 heterodimer. In humans, NXT1 has an X-chromosomal paralog, NXT2, which exhibits testis-enriched expression, suggesting a role in spermatogenesis. Here, we report the in vivo interaction of NXT2 with crucial components of the nuclear export machinery, including NXF1, the testis-specific NXF1 paralogs NXF2 and NXF3, and nuclear pore complex proteins. Binding to NXF2 and NXF3 is mediated by the NTF2-like domain of NXT2. By identifying infertile men with loss-of-function variants in NXT2 and NXF3, we link the impaired NXT2-NXF activity to disturbed germ cell development. The predominant absence of germ cells in men with NXT2 deficiency indicates its critical function already during fetal or first steps of germ cell development. In contrast, loss of NXF3 affects later stages of spermatogenesis, resulting in quantitatively and qualitatively impaired sperm production.

This study shows that endemism of birds increases from north to south, and highlights the vulnerability of southern hemisphere communities to climate change. 
 Endemism is a highly valuable metric for conservation because it identifies areas with irreplaceable species, ecological functions, or evolutionary lineages. Global analyses of endemism currently fail to identify the most irreplaceable areas because the commonly used endemism metrics are correlated with richness, and entire regions, especially low-richness areas in the southern hemisphere, are regularly excluded. Global patterns of endemism are therefore still insufficiently known. Here, using metrics representing irreplaceability, we unveil global patterns of avian taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic endemism that show striking differences between hemispheres. Across all facets of diversity, endemism decreases poleward in the northern hemisphere but increases poleward in the southern hemisphere, resulting in a global north-south increase in endemism. The pattern appears to be driven by smaller and increasingly discontinuous landmasses towards the south which lead to smaller ranges and reduced overlap in community composition, as well as to global peaks of diversity relative to available area in the southern hemisphere. Our findings suggest that there are key areas of irreplaceability that might be missed if analyses are focused on species richness and omit species-poor regions. Highly endemic southern-hemisphere communities might be especially vulnerable to the climate crisis because discontinuous landmasses impede range shifts. Global patterns of endemism (irreplaceability) are still not well known.

 RNA velocity inference is a valuable tool for understanding cell development, differentiation, and disease progression. However, existing RNA velocity inference methods typically rely on explicit assumptions of ordinary differential equations (ODE), which prohibits them from capturing complex transcriptomic expression patterns. In this study, we introduce TIVelo, a RNA velocity estimation approach that first determines the velocity direction at the cell cluster level based on trajectory inference, before estimating velocity for individual cells. TIVelo calculates an orientation score to infer the direction at the cluster level without an explicit ODE assumption, which effectively captures complex transcriptional patterns, avoiding potential inconsistencies in velocity estimation for genes that do not follow the simple ODE assumption. We validated the effectiveness of TIVelo by its application to 16 real datasets and the comparison with six benchmarking methods.

 Ocean alkalinity enhancement is a marine-based carbon dioxide removal strategy that involves adding alkaline material to the surface ocean to boost carbon uptake and storage. The physical circulation of ocean water exerts fundamental control on the dilution, spreading, and retention of alkaline materials, influencing carbon removal effectiveness, environmental impacts, and monitoring feasibility. Here we evaluate potential sites and timing for ocean alkalinity enhancement on the U.S. Northeast Shelf by conducting passive tracer simulations from 2009 to 2017. Monthly dye release experiments across ten locations were analyzed by quantifying dye evolution metrics such as surface spread, lateral movement, upper-ocean concentration, and gas transfer velocity. A site selection index was developed to assess site and time suitability for tracer dispersal for ocean alkalinity enhancement. Results showed strong seasonality, with optimal conditions in summer and less favorable conditions in winter. Among the tested locations, Wilkinson Basin emerged as the most favorable tracer release site due to its larger spreading area, higher tracer concentrations, and longer decay time. These findings inform a future field experiment in the region and offer a scalable framework for guiding future research on ocean alkalinity enhancement in other regions based on physical characteristics of tracer evolution.

 The Mekong River, a global freshwater biodiversity hotspot, has suffered from intensive barrier construction, resulting in major challenges in safeguarding its fauna. Here, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of the impacts of river barriers on the distribution of 952 fish species in the Mekong River Basin. Our analysis revealed that 93% of Mekong fish species analysed suffer from habitat fragmentation, and species with larger habitat range requirements experienced higher river fragmentation impacts. Sub-basins along the main channel in the Lower Mekong had high values of species richness but relatively high barrier impacts. Across all migration types, freshwater-resident migratory (potamodromous) fishes were affected by the greatest levels of habitat fragmentation (Fragmentation Index, 42.45 [95% confidence interval, 38.61–46.62]). Among all International Union for Conservation of Nature conservation status categories, Critically Endangered species experienced the highest habitat fragmentation index (34.48 [19.46–53.52]). Among all barrier types in the Mekong, small dams and sluice gates contributed more to habitat fragmentation than large dams. While the effects of existing individual large dams on habitat fragmentation and fish distribution in the Mekong Basin are greater than for small barriers, the cumulative impacts of small barriers are greater; hence, basin-wide connectivity planning is needed for more effective conservation.

 Proliferation of retrogressive thaw slumps has the potential to dominate the sediment yield in arctic watersheds through an influx of hillslope-derived sediment to rivers. We develop a suite of algorithms to semi-automate measurements of thaw slump growth and river suspended sediment concentrations from satellite imagery with the intent of linking the production of sediments on a hillslope to the presence of sediment in an adjacent stream at the seasonal scale. We apply our semi-automated methods to quantify seasonal changes in scar zone area, headwall retreat, and suspended sediment concentration at a thaw slump in the Canadian Northwest Territories, which has doubled in size during the observation period. The semi-automated approaches record up to 30 cm/day of headwall retreat, strongly correlated with warm season temperature, and an approximate doubling in suspended sediment concentration downstream of the thaw slump relative to an upstream control reach. The semi-automated results of the slump growth compare well with previous observations of retrogressive thaw slumps and with manual measurements from satellite imagery. Seasonal patterns in the suspended sediment concentration and thaw slump erosion identify the signal of thaw slump sediments in the river as most prominent during the late summer, when sediment stored in the scar zone can be mobilized by precipitation. The ability of the semi-automated methods to capture the seasonal dynamics of the reach demonstrates the possibility of extending their use to other thaw slumps across the Arctic."

 The geospatial community usually use GIS environments to handle databases and pre-process their information, whereas complex analyses, especially data-driven ones, are performed outside GIS platforms. This interrupts the flow of information and the processing chain in a number of I/O operations that inevitably slow down the overall analytical protocols. The first version of the SZ-plugin attempted to mitigate this issue by offering a modeling solution within QGIS. However, the available models in the SZ-plugin essentially boiled down to binary classifiers, whose dimensionality was constrained to address pure spatial problems. In this updated version, we focused on two major aspects: (1) a space–time extension and (2) the inclusion of a regression option in addition to the already existing classification one. These two aspects have been introduced as part of two new models, namely, a Generalized Additive Modeling and a Multi-Layer Perceptron. In short, these would allow users to obtain susceptibility and intensity estimates in space and time. An improved graphical reporting tool has also been implemented. This makes it possible to produce relevant statistical summaries as well as cartographic outputs to be directly integrated into technical reports or scientific documents.

This paper contributes to the understanding of the potential gendered impact of putative just transition programmes in Africa through the analyses of different gendered impacts in three zones of resource extraction in Uganda, namely mining in Karamoja, a sugar cane plantation in Mabira Forest and oil extraction via the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP). Employing an intersectional and decolonial feminist lens, the paper identifies three gendered dimensions of extractivist impacts, namely sexual violence, barred access to basic necessities and dispossession of land.

The response of the climate system to CO2 variation exhibits hysteresis and irreversibility, highlighting the difficulty of recovery and the potential for long-lasting impacts. We investigated the hysteresis and reversibility of global drought and the associated underlying drivers. The Community Earth System Model 2 was used to simulate CO2 changes: linear increases, decreases (i.e. net negative), and restoration to the initial level. This paper incorporates three well-established indices based on atmospheric, meteorological and soil moisture data to reflect drought. Here, we show that drought is dominant during the CO2 decrease phase, leading to strong hysteresis with irreversible behavior over more than half of the global land cover. The robust irreversible changes in drought are concentrated in specific areas, i.e. hotspots, covering over 11% of the global land and are particularly pronounced in Northern Africa, Southwest Russia, and Central America. A decrease in precipitation drives drought during the CO2 increase phase, while an enhanced vapor pressure deficit (VPD) exacerbates it during the CO2 decrease phase. This increased VPD exacerbates drought hysteresis by raising potential evapotranspiration. Our findings suggest that only CO2 reduction is not enough to effectively mitigate drought impacts, rather advanced water management strategies are essential."

The importance of hydrology is self-evident, but we posit that questions about the causes of and potential solutions for groundwater problems, and pathways to better policymaking, are fundamentally economics questions in that they rely on understanding people’s preferences, incentives, and responses to laws and other institutions that guide people’s actions. Not surprisingly then, most hydrologic research questions implicitly arise in response to economic demands and constraints. Hydrology and economics both rely on positive science involving theory, empirical methods, calibration, and validation. Indeed, their models can be linked to characterize and understand their interdependent dynamics. While other natural and social sciences also have important roles to play, this paper focuses primarily on how economics connects (ground)water to policymaking. Economics is a broad discipline with a primary role in understanding how people live in a landscape. Analogous to hydrology’s primary role in describing how water flows, recedes, seeps, evaporates, or recharges aquifers, economics describes people’s endeavors including their use of water, land, and other resources to produce, consume, trade, invest, conserve, and degrade the systems where they live. Policymaking is normative: it involves value judgments when assessing tradeoffs, setting priorities, or choosing among policy options. Economics is unique among disciplines in that it also comprises ‘normative analysis’ frameworks for measuring people’s values as a guide toward satisfying those preferences to the greatest extent possible (e.g. using benefit-cost analysis). But when natural science research is conducted without recognizing the economic considerations relevant to policymakers and managers, it may overlook critical ways that human system structures, dynamics, and people’s values inform the most promising ways to turn science into policy. By collaborating with economists, interdisciplinary research can bring natural sciences together with positive and normative economics to promote better groundwater policy."

Here, we addressed this evidence gap in India and assessed the association between residential greenspace and the prevalence of low birth weight (LBW) (birth weight ⩽2500 g) among Indian mothers. We analyzed health and demographic data from India’s National Family and Health Survey conducted between 2015–16 and 2019–21. Greenspace exposure was quantified using high-resolution moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer-derived enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data with a 30–days temporal resolution. Multivariable binomial logistic regression models were employed, adjusting for maternal demographics, lifestyle behaviors, socioeconomic status, household characteristics, and exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Among 38 358 participants, 13 677 (35.6%) had LBW. We found a protective association between EVI and the odds of LBW, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.95–1.03) after controlling for covariates. When stratified by PM2.5 exposure levels, the protective effect of EVI was strongest in areas with low PM2.5 concentrations (OR = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.85–1.00), corresponding to an 8% reduction in the odds of LBW. In areas with medium-high exposure, the effect was attenuated (OR = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.90–1.06), while in high exposure areas, the association reversed, with EVI linked to a 23% increase in LBW odds (OR = 1.23; 95% CI: 1.13–1.34). The protective effect was found in urban areas rather than in rural areas and in economically affluent households. Our results suggest that increasing access to greenspace can serve as an adaptive measure to reduce the prevalence of LBW. Further cohort studies are recommended to ascertain the underlying mechanisms."

However, considerable uncertainty remains regarding the estimates of these future carbon losses. Here, we analysed Earth system model (ESM) simulations to assess future changes in tropical vegetation biomass potential due to shifts in the hydrological cycle. We found that tropical ecosystems could experience substantial decreases in vegetation biomass potential, particularly under high-emission scenarios, due to decreasing precipitation, increasing evaporation demand, and higher rainfall seasonality. These declines are principally driven by the transition of Amazon rainforests towards drier ecosystems. However, the difference in tropical vegetation biomass potential between most extreme ESMs reached 73 Pg C at the end of this century for the shared socio-economic pathway (SSP) 2–4.5 and 147 Pg C for SSP5-8.5. Weighting models based on their ability to reproduce the current hydroclimate in the tropics resulted in a reduction of vegetation biomass potential by 2100 in SSP2-4.5 of 12 Pg C (8–16 Pg C) compared with a simple average of all ESMs which gave 20 Pg C (17–24 Pg C). Our findings underscore the urgent need to reduce not only direct anthropogenic disturbances but also the rate of global greenhouse gas emissions to preserve the vegetation biomass potential of tropical ecosystems."

These narratives are constituted and underpinned by statements and nurture a growing polarisation by isolation of their underlying scientific evidence. The multidimensional and interdisciplinary nature of a protein transition does not go well with an isolated approach in academia. The latter leads to fragmented and incomplete scientific evidence that fails to fully grasp the complexity of the issue, while being used to form partial statements that feed societal and political debates. Through a Restatement approach, this paper aims to (i) synthesise scientific evidence from multiple academic disciplines related to a protein transition and (ii) critically reflect on the implications of the current fragmented scientific evidence landscape of a protein transition in academia and beyond. The Restatement is structured into three sections: Background, Context, and Impacts, with subsections that each cover 4–17 statements, with a total of 68 statements. We connected each statement to its supporting scientific evidence which revealed the complexity of how evidence is related and interpreted, in addition to the inconsistent use of terminology and resulting ambiguities. The main takeaway from the Restatement is that a protein transition cannot be reduced to a single message of a dietary shift but that it should be approached more holistically, while using the available evidence within the appropriate context and critical consideration of the methodologies used to obtain that evidence. This Restatement can be used by researchers and decision-makers working toward more sustainable food systems in the European Union and beyond, to understand the contexts and methods that are not within their own field of expertise. In addition, we stress that overcoming polarisation in a protein transition largely relies on critical reflections of the assumptions, interests and power dynamics shaping the protein transition debate."

I conduct a survey experiment that compares views on an energy tax policy to views on a policy that taxes a high-emissions consumer good (red meat & dairy products). The results show that the effect of targeting consumer goods on support for decarbonization depends on an individual’s consumption preferences. Frequent consumers become less supportive of climate policy when it affects a particular consumer good, whereas non-consumers become more supportive. We observe the first outcome even though the cost of the two policies to consumers is equivalent, highlighting the role of subjective and identity attachments to consumer goods in policy attitudes. This shows how climate policy can favor the interests of certain consumers over others, making groups of consumers another relevant distributive cleavage in climate politics."

Strong TVEs suppress precipitation over the Maritime Continent and lower global mean sea surface temperature (SST), while inducing warming in the equatorial central Pacific, resulting in an El Niño-like SST pattern. These anomalies weaken the Walker Circulation and drive low-level westerly wind and upper-level easterly wind anomalies over the tropical Pacific, creating favorable conditions for enhanced Pacific TCGF.

Here, we used two models (LANDIS-II and DHSVM) in linked simulations to evaluate the effects of wildfire and forest management scenarios on future snowpack and streamflow dynamics. We characterized the biophysical attributes of the areas with the greatest potential for treatments to improve hydrologic functioning and we examined projected trends in flow regimes over the 21st century. We found that, despite a projected increase in total annual flows, there was a steep decline in snowpack and late-season flows. Wildfire was an important factor influencing streamflow and snowpack dynamics, with increasing burned area partially offsetting climate-driven declines in snowpack and spring flows. Forest thinning treatments contributed modest increases to annual flows, although effects were overshadowed by the influences of climate and wildfire. Warming winter temperatures extinguished snowmelt-driven flows in low- and mid-elevation watersheds, causing a transition from spring snowmelt- to autumn rain-dominated streamflow regimes. Our results complement prior empirical studies showing that forest treatments can improve snowpack retention and annual streamflow, and they emphasize the importance of wildfire as a primary factor governing landscape hydrology. We found that neither land management practices nor wildfire could completely compensate for the top–down controls of future climate on landscape hydrology. Declines in snowpack retention and a regime shift in the timing of peak flows will have dramatic consequences for forest health, human water resources, and Pacific salmon populations."

Although its seasonal impacts are well established, its subseasonal variability and long-term changes remain less understood. This study identifies significant changes in the influence of WP on surface temperature over South Korea since the mid-1990s using observational and reanalysis datasets. Our analysis reveals a significant shift in the WP teleconnection, with its influence strengthening in December but weakening in January and February. This change is attributed to an anomalous displacement of the WP-associated anticyclone and modulated by interactions with the Arctic Oscillation. Furthermore, seasonal forecast models from the Asia–Pacific Economic Cooperation Climate Center multi-model ensemble capture the WP-induced temperature variations in December; however, strong modulation by El Niño–Southern Oscillation inhibits the independent effect of the WP teleconnection. These findings highlight the critical gaps in seasonal forecast models and emphasize the need for improved representations of WP teleconnections in subseasonal forecasts. A refined understanding of winter temperature variability is essential for enhancing climate predictions, supporting climate adaptation strategies, and mitigating societal risks associated with increasing winter temperature variability in South Korea."

Here we perform a first global intercomparison between five global satellite-derived reservoir storage datasets, namely GLWS, GRS, GloLakes, GRDL-Y and GRDL-L. Overall, we find generally good agreement in relative storage time series (median RMSE between datasets = 8.7% of capacity), with little substantial difference in agreement between datasets. Agreement in absolute storage is much worse (median = 19.4%), and for absolute storage, GloLakes has higher error than the other datasets. We find that agreement is worse in highly variable reservoirs, new reservoirs, and, notably, in developing countries. All datasets agree that, globally, construction of new reservoirs is driving a net increase in reservoir storage over 1999–2018, yet there is disagreement in the magnitude of these trends. Overall, our results lend confidence to the utility of satellite-derived global reservoir storage datasets for water management applications.

However, projecting ocean dynamic processes affecting sea-level change faces two main challenges: (1) the ocean’s thermal inertia and dynamics can lead to substantial nonlinearities both on a global (thermal expansion) and regional scale (dynamic sea level); and (2) simulating ocean dynamic sea-level change over multiple centuries with global climate models is computationally intensive. To address these challenges, we use an energy balance model (EBM) to emulate the thermal responses of models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) and evaluate its optimal layer configuration for reproducing both thermal expansion and dynamic sea-level change. We compare results between a two and a three-layer EBM configuration, as fitting more than three layers can lead to EBM parameter overfitting. We find that both configurations perform similarly when emulating thermal expansion, with performance being highly dependent on accurate EBM forcing. To emulate dynamic sea level, we couple the EBM to a multivariate pattern scaling approach that relates the response of layer temperatures to regional changes in dynamic sea level. The latter demonstrates clear advantages of a three-layer configuration under high-emission scenarios, leading to an 18% reduction in emulator error at 2300 while capturing nonlinearities more effectively. Coupling the regional emulator with a simple climate model to propagate climate uncertainties further highlights the advantage of using a three-layer approach, leading to more stable parameter fitting and reducing uncertainty in probabilistic projection by up to one global mean standard deviation. Our findings suggest that multi-layer EBMs can more accurately mimic long-term (up to 2300) CMIP6 projections of sterodynamic sea-level changes while limiting computational burden and reducing uncertainty in emulators due to statistical fitting."

However, diverse, spatially distributed sources make characterizing urban CH4 emissions challenging. A limited synthesis of existing research has hindered understanding of source characteristics and contributions, implicating research priorities, policies, and mitigation. This review consolidates findings from 106 peer-reviewed articles on CH4 emissions in U.S. and Canadian cities, identifying key insights, gaps, and opportunities. We found that top-down (TD) estimates of city-scale CH4 emissions from 34 studies exceeded, on average, bottom-up (BU) estimates by a factor of 3.9 (±6.7). Urban CH4 footprints were dominated by sources from natural gas distribution and end-use and landfills. Across 11 U.S. studies, the estimated mean CH4 loss rate from delivered natural gas corrected for CH4 content in cities was 2.3% (±0.9%). TD estimates of CH4 emissions from six U.S. landfills were, on average, 2.4 (±1.7) times greater than self-reported BU estimates. Preferred methods for reporting may miss large fugitive point sources, systematically underestimating landfill CH4 emissions. The studies indicated that wastewater systems emit less CH4 than landfills and natural gas sources, but the research remains limited, and many wastewater sources are poorly characterized. Mitigation effectiveness varied by source, with scalability a challenge for small, distributed sources such as sewers, and the confirmation of reductions sensitive to measurement scale. Overall, results highlight challenges in quantifying, attributing, and mitigating CH4 emissions in urban settings. Key research priorities are: (i) expanding CH4 measurements from urban natural gas (distribution and end-use) and wastewater sources, and granular investigations to pinpoint and understand the causes of emissions; (ii) new emissions data to improve BU models and integrate into BU estimates; (iii) improving measurement-model coupling for landfill CH4 quantification; and (iv) evaluating mitigation strategies for urban CH4 sources."

 Particle acidity serves as a key determinant in atmospheric chemical processes. Emerging concerns regarding aerosol acidity trends have been highlighted amid China's sustained initiatives to mitigate emissions of both acidic and alkaline precursors, especially in North China, which is significantly affected by dust aerosol. 12-year observational data in Zhengzhou reveal that the annual average PM2.5 concentration decreased from 162±81µgm-3 in 2011 to 60±41µgm-3 in 2022, with the largest reduction in sulfate (73 %). Correspondingly, the annual particle pH increased by 0.10 units from 2011–2019. In addition, the elevated particle pH in 2015 and 2018 was notably influenced by the increase in TNHx (NH3+NH4+). Note that the crustal material concentrations and their proportions increased significantly during 2019–2022, which might be responsible for the resuspension of surrounding soil dust. Even though the TNHx concentration was decreasing, the annual average growth rate of pH values increased to 0.21 units from 2019–2022. This phenomenon is not unique to Zhengzhou, as major cities in the North China Plain have also experienced a pronounced upward trend in coarse particles after 2019.

 Accurately simulating historical surface temperature variations is essential for evaluating climate models, yet many struggle to reproduce the mid-20th-century temperature trends associated with significant volcanic eruptions. This study examines the impact of volcanic sulfate aerosol representation on these biases using the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM). The standard CMIP6 protocol prescribes volcanic forcing through radiative perturbations, omitting volcanic aerosol–cloud interactions (VACIs). Here, we implement an emission-based approach with an updated volcanic eruption inventory that directly incorporates volcanic sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions, enabling a more process-based representation of volcanic forcing. This approach leads to improved surface temperature variability and a modest reduction in cold biases between 1940 and 1980 compared to the CMIP6 setup. Additionally, we assess cloud property responses to a more realistic volcanic sulfate aerosol representation, which weakens cloud-induced cooling during periods of lower volcanic activity. However, despite these refinements, a significant temperature cold bias remains, indicating that further improvements in atmospheric chemistry, aerosol microphysics, cloud processes, and model parameterizations are needed to fully resolve this issue in E3SM."

In this study, we implemented neighborhood communication using both the traditional point-to-point communication method and the distributed graph communication topology. We then compare their performance in a case study using the finite-volume wave modeling (FVWAM), including both small-scale regional and large-scale global experiments. Based on the Intel MPI library, the distributed graph topology outperforms the point-to-point communication method for inter-node communication with 32 to 32 768 processes. For small-scale regional experiments with 32 to 512 processes, compared to the point-to-point method, the distributed graph topology achieved an average communication time speedup ranging from 4.78 to 11.67. For operational global wave forecasts with 1024 processes, the runtime of the FVWAM was reduced by 40.2 % when the point-to-point communication method was replaced by the distributed graph communication topology."

Not all salmonids are sensitive to acute lethality caused by 6PPD-Q, with 6PPD-Q potency varying by several orders of magnitude among teleosts. The main driver(s) of species sensitivity differences is (are) a pressing question, with one area of interest examining whether differences in teleosts’ ability to biotransform and detoxify 6PPD-Q could be a key factor. This study utilized liquid-chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) to assess biotransformation and metabolome-wide effects of 6PPD-Q on early life stage salmonids, including two sensitive species, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), and one tolerant species, brown trout (Salmo trutta). Three phase I TPs and seven phase II TPs were detected, with differences in peak area ratios revealing that brown trout had the greatest ability to conjugate phase I TPs. Monohydroxylated TPs were verified using codeveloped analytical standards that will be of use for future biomonitoring and exposure assessment. Several endogenous metabolites were found to be dysregulated in rainbow and lake trout, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction, altered metabolism, and disrupted membrane permeability. Results of this study indicate a potential difference in the biotransformation capability of 6PPD-Q among Salmonidae fish species, detection of a unique phase I TP in sensitive Salmonidae species, and subsequent unique metabolome responses."

However, ecologically realistic field experiments investigating these multiple stressor effects on emerging aquatic insects are scarce. To empirically test whether exposure to imidacloprid (1, 10 μg/L) and two different climate change scenarios (i) elevated temperatures (+4 °C vs. ambient temperatures) and (ii) reoccurring heatwaves (+0 to 8 °C) may cause a decline in insect emergence, we conducted an outdoor mesocosm study. Aquatic insect communities were exposed to single and combined stressors, while emergence was monitored during a 3-month period. We report significant losses in insect biomass and abundance under single and combined treatments. The high imidacloprid treatment and elevated temperatures combined caused a significant 47% decline in total insect biomass across the insect orders Diptera, Ephemeroptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, Odonata, and Trichoptera. Community structure and population dynamics were significantly affected, with Diptera and Ephemeroptera being most sensitive to the high and both imidacloprid treatments, respectively. Diptera dominated but was significantly reduced by the high imidacloprid and heatwave combination. Temperature-enhanced imidacloprid toxicity and the significant threat these stressors pose to aquatic insect communities highlight the need for effective climate change mitigation strategies to conserve aquatic insect biodiversity."

Previous studies in birds have found sublethal exposure to neonicotinoids can reduce body mass and fat stores, but the underlying mechanism is not clear. We hypothesized that neonicotinoids reduce body mass principally by acting as an appetite suppressant rather than increasing energy consumption. Red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) were exposed to an oral dose of one of three neonicotinoids at concentrations that could realistically be consumed by seed-eating birds (0, 10, 20, or 30 mg/kg bw of imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, or clothianidin) or were given a moderate or high food-restricted diet (n = 9 or 10 birds per treatment) and were then monitored for 3 days. Imidacloprid caused neurotoxic symptoms and rapid reductions in food consumption and body mass that persisted for >48 h. Food restriction had similar effects on body mass and biochemical indicators of energetic state (plasma triglycerides, uric acid, and β-hydroxybutyrate), which suggests appetite suppression was the main driver of mass loss in imidacloprid-exposed birds. Single doses of clothianidin and thiamethoxam altered food consumption and biochemical markers, but effects were less severe than for imidacloprid, and neither compound caused overt neurotoxicity. This study confirms that acute neonicotinoid exposures can affect behavior, appetite, mass, and energetic state in seed-eating songbirds, with potential consequences for survival."

The aim of this study was to determine the temporal variability and spatial distribution of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) in the larger German rivers Rhine and Moselle. Monitoring campaigns using a continuous flow centrifuge (sampling of suspended matter in a particle size range of 1 mm–1 μm) revealed a strong dependence of PVC concentrations of up to 3.3 μg/L on the discharge. It could be shown that PVC microplastic concentrations have strong correlations with suspended matter (correlation coefficients >0.94 with p-values <0.05). PVC microplastics and suspended matter were thus evidenced to show an identical temporal behavior in the Rhine River and Moselle. Furthermore, our results indicate that the pollution with PVC microplastic is mainly originated from diffuse rather than point sources. Elevated PVC loads were mainly observed during floods. Our study confirmed that approximately 80% of the PVC loads can be exclusively attributed to these high discharge events. Calculated annual PVC loads (2019–2022) ranged from 2–17 t/a (Moselle) to 10–38 t/a (Rhine).

Here, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations were performed to elucidate the surface reaction of CO2 using three basaltic minerals. To mimic natural conditions, the mineral surfaces were first hydrolyzed by water exposure. The simulation provides molecular-scale evidence that naturally occurring basaltic mineral surfaces are CO2-active. Three previously unrecognized pathways were revealed, distinct from the conventional dissolution–precipitation paradigm. These pathways involve CO2 directly reacting with hydrolyzed mineral surfaces, at nonbridging oxygens (NBOs) and metal-coordinated hydroxyl groups, forming stable carbonate (CO32–), bicarbonate (HCO3–), and hydrogen pyrocarbonate (HC2O5–) species. The surface reaction capacity exhibits a first-order dependence on the density of NBOs. The presence of interfacial water plays a dual role in modulating the CO2 chemisorption. We find that the surface reaction induces coordination distortion at metal sites, potentially lowering the dissolution energy barrier of carbonated metal ions and facilitating a self-sustaining cycle of surface reactivity renewal. These findings establish the existence of CO2 surface reactions as a critical yet overlooked driver of enhanced carbon mineralization in basaltic systems."

This study compares MC-LR degradation in three different water types using UV-C light emitted from a krypton-chlorine excimer lamp (UV light at 222 nm, UV222) or a low-pressure (LP) Hg lamp (UV light at 254 nm, UV254). Quantitative analyses by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), ultra-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection (UPLC-PDA), and high-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) demonstrated that UV222 had a degradation rate constant 2.4–4.2 times greater than UV254. This aligns with the MC-LR molar absorption (ε) and quantum yield (Φ) in deionized (DI) water. LC-HRMS revealed the photoisomer concentration increasing with UV dose. Trends of abundant photoisomers indicate further degradation. Together, these trends indicate UV222 is a more complete pathway toward protein phosphatase inhibition 2A (PP2A) inactive compounds than UV254.

The compaction of pores reduces solvent permeability and significantly impacts separation performance. Despite the importance of membrane compaction, its fundamental mechanisms have not been well studied. In this study, we combine well-controlled experiments and theory to analyze the relationship between pressure and porosity profiles within membranes. Specifically, we stack six porous films in a customized dead-end cell and measure the solvent content of each film immediately after pressure-driven solvent permeation tests. We show that, when a viscous solvent permeates through the stacked membranes, membrane porosity continuously decreases from the feed side to the permeate side. Compaction results in ∼25% reduction in solvent content (or porosity) at the membrane permeate side under 10 bar applied pressure and up to ∼50% reduction under 40 bar. We further analyze the stress–strain behavior of solvent-swollen films under mechanical compression and compare it to the compacted porosity in the solvent permeation tests. Our analysis reveals that the compression pressure in the permeation tests corresponds to the reduction in hydrostatic pressure within the membrane. In addition, we investigate the compaction behavior when membranes with varying pore sizes are stacked. Our results show that solvent permeating from tight-to-loose films induces significantly greater compaction than flow in the loose-to-tight direction. The compaction in tight-to-loose membrane stacking causes a 27% greater loss in membrane solvent content compared to the reverse arrangement. Notably, this study demonstrates that porosity gradients resulting from compaction cannot be interpreted as concentration gradients that drive diffusive solvent transport. Overall, our findings can inform the design of membranes with improved resistance to compaction by guiding material selection, processing techniques, and structural optimization."

SOA can form through nucleation of low-volatility organic compounds, following atmospheric oxidation, or by condensing these vapors onto existing particles. In either of these cases, the formation of SOA particles could be affected by atmospheric conditions (e.g., relative humidity (RH)) and particle liquid water content. This study examines the effects of RH on the formation and composition of SOA from dark α-pinene (C10H16) ozonolysis, as a canonical system, with or without ammonium sulfate (AS, (NH4)2SO4) seed particles across varying RH levels. Using online extractive electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, we identified monomers (C7–10) and dimers (C15–20) in the SOA with high chemical and temporal resolution. In both cases, high RH (>90%) promotes dimer formation in the particle phase, while they appear at the beginning of the experiment when (NH4)2SO4 seeds are present. The prompt increase in dimers in high RH seed containing experiments (60–65% dimers), which are absent at low RH (10%), suggests that intraparticle reactions are responsible for the dimer formation."

First, by employing a virus tracing technique, we observed a decrease in the neural projection ratio of excitatory neural neurons from the “Entorhinal Cortex-Dentate Gyrus-CA3-CA1” and “Entorhinal Cortex-CA1” circuits. Furthermore, BPA exposure led to impairments of the branching complexity and electrophysiological properties of hippocampal neurons. Additionally, fiber photometry experiments revealed that BPA exposure reduces the level of real-time activity in hippocampal excitatory neurons (CA1, CA3, and DG) during the MWM task. To verify the role of hippocampal excitatory neurons in learning and memory impairment caused by BPA, the dorsal hippocampus CA1 neurons were chemogenetically activated, and the spatial memory deficits were rescued.

This is mainly due to a significant reduction (weak change) in basinwide TC genesis but also a southeastward (northwestward) shift in El Niño (La Niña). This leads to longer‐tracked (shorter‐tracked) storms in El Niño (La Niña). Furthermore, in El Niño years, ENSO‐related signals migrate farther eastward, leading to the regions suppressing TC genesis being much larger than those favoring TC genesis.

In this study, we compare the dependence of hiss power on both L shell (2 ≤ L ≤ 6) and the ratio of electron plasma frequency to electron gyrofrequency (ωpe/Ωce) using observations from the Van Allen Probes. The statistical comparison spans a wide range of magnetic local times, frequency bands, and substorm activity levels. Hiss power shows a stronger correlation with ωpe/Ωce than with L shell, especially at low frequencies and during periods of enhanced substorm activity.

We use data from the HARMONIE‐Climate (HCLIM) model applied at 12 and 3 km resolutions and examine the extreme precipitation response by the middle and end of the century in the RCP8.5 emission scenario. Our results show that: (a) precipitation intensity is projected to increase across almost all regions, except for daily extremes from HCLIM models driven by EC‐EARTH global climate model (GCM) in the southern and south‐western regions. HCLIM simulations driven by GFDL‐CM3 GCM project a larger increase in extremes compared with those driven by EC‐EARTH, which is likely associated with the stronger warming and moistening seen in GFDL‐CM3 over northern Europe in this scenario. (b) Frequency of both hourly and daily extremes is projected to increase in the future. However, the seasonality of extremes does not exhibit a shift, except for hourly extremes in the western region shifting from autumn‐winter to spring‐summer, and southern region shifting from spring‐summer to autumn‐winter. (c) Convection‐permitting simulations (∼3 km grid spacing) show a larger increase in extreme precipitation at both daily and hourly timescales across most seasons except winter while also projecting a comparable increase in the frequency of extreme events to convection‐parameterized models (∼12 km) in most regions.

 Achieving highly ordered and uniformly covered self-assembly monolayers (SAMs) with optimal packing configuration on textured silicon substrates remains a critical challenge for further improving the efficiency of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (TSCs)1-3. Here we design an asymmetric SAM (named as HTL201) featuring anchoring group and spacer flanking a carbazole core, serving as hole selective layer (HSL) for perovskite/silicon TSCs. When compared to symmetric SAMs with nitrogen-bonded phosphonic acid group, the HTL201 molecule exhibits minimized steric hindrance and improved coverage on the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) recombination layer. The strong coordination interaction between HTL201 and perovskite film effectively reduces non-radiative recombination at buried interface. Notably, the optimized energy level alignment between perovskite and HTL201, accompanied by an increase in quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) value of the perovskite layer, enables an impressive voltage of nearly 2 V for perovskite/silicon TSCs, resulting in a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 34.58% based on a silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell."

 Tropical forest degradation results in severe biomass loss and biodiversity decline. However, fine-scale natural and logging-related forest disturbances remain difficult to trace, both from the ground as well as remotely. Comprehensive, landscape scale characterization of anthropogenic forest degradation requires accurate accounting of baseline canopy disturbance rates and patterns. This paper has evaluated the feasibility of radar data for detecting canopy gaps created by natural and anthropogenic mechanisms at large spatial scale by assessing the extent to which the Sentinel-1 C-band radar signal can be used to map fine-scale disturbances in both naturally disturbed and logged landscapes. Our physical-based method detects disturbances based on changes in backscatter resulting from radar shadow and/or layover. We apply various detection thresholds to explore the trade-off between detection and false detection and validate our method in study areas for which spatially exhaustive drone-based canopy gap maps are available for validation, namely Barro Colorado Island nature reserve (median gap area: 39 m2) and five logging concessions in the Congo Basin (median gap area: 237 m2). With a moderate threshold (2.5 dB backscatter reduction), we reach detection rates above 65 percent for disturbances above 200 m2 in both naturally disturbed and logged areas. Detection rates were primarily driven by gap area; gap depth had a smaller, yet significant, influence. These results significantly improve on operational forest disturbance products and previous studies on fine-scale disturbance detection using Sentinel-1 radar. Moreover, the improved insight in detection accuracies of anthropogenic disturbances fosters a move towards monitoring forest dynamics across large scales at which we cannot be certain whether the disturbance driver is anthropogenic or natural."

 The effective scattering albedo (ω) is a key parameter in the zero-order radiative transfer equation (known as the τ-ω model) for passive microwave retrieval of soil moisture (SM) and vegetation optical depth (VOD), quantifying the scattering energy loss as microwave radiation passes through the vegetation canopy. The scattering effects of vegetation are influenced by time-dependent factors such as plant geometry, vegetation water content, and canopy structure, suggesting that ω may vary over time. However, in the current τ-ω model-based retrieval algorithms used by orbiting L-band sensors, namely the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), ω is generally assumed to be time-invariant and assigned a fixed value according to land cover types. In this study, we aim to analyze and understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of ω, its relationship with vegetation water stress and the driving factors behind microwave scattering characteristics over tropical forests. By assuming a vegetation transmittance of zero for rigorously selected dense forest areas in the tropics, we calculated ω from the SMAP L-band radiometer observations during 2018–2023. Regarding the spatial distribution of ω, we observed distinct spatial dynamics within the same land cover type. The lowest ω values were typically found in the northeastern Amazon. Additionally, ω exhibited clear temporal dynamics, displaying a unimodal pattern in the Amazon and a bimodal pattern in the Congo. Clear polarization dependence of ω was observed, with values consistently higher at Horizontal (H-) polarization compared to Vertical (V-) polarization. Despite this, the seasonal patterns of ω are similar at both H- and V-polarizations. The seasonal variation of ω was found to be asynchronous with soil water availability indicated by root zone soil moisture (RZSM) across different regions. The shortest time lags (0–30 days) between ω and RZSM were observed in the densely vegetated northeastern Amazon, while the longest occurred in the northeastern Congo. A machine-learning based interpretation of the spatial variability of ω and time lag indicates that the values of ω are strongly and inversely related to canopy height, while the time lag is mainly associated with precipitation and soil water content. Our results deepen the understanding of the spatio-temporal dynamics of ω and could contribute to the improvement of SM and VOD retrieval algorithms, thereby enhancing the utility of these variables as indicators for monitoring vegetation carbon dynamics and phenology in dense tropical forests."

 High-precision topographic LiDAR point clouds provide a concrete elevation basis for many environmental and ecological applications, but they suffer from distinctly uneven density with voids of varying sizes. Interpolation tools most commonly serve to resample the density and fill the voids under the designated scale of the application. However, the target spaces in which the topographic point clouds reside are essentially non-Euclidean surfaces; the true distances between sample points are curved geodesic distances, which differ significantly from the conventionally used Euclidean distances, so classical interpolation models should be investigated for potential systematic biases.First, we introduce geodesic distance to topographic point clouds as a dimensionality reduction constraint to project the point cloud. This ensures the positive definiteness of the autocorrelation matrix and the revision of conventional interpolation algorithms. Then, we carried out a benchmark interpolation with deterministic and geostatistical models on a relatively “regular” topographic point cloud. Product point cloud resampling was subsequently examined with the optimal method. In response to the computational challenge, we devise a feature-points embedded domain decomposition calculation and propose a cross-validation-based point-to-point distance for better evaluation of the interpolation accuracy.The experimental results with different scenarios show substantial improvement in interpolation accuracy with the introduction of geodesic distance, which is of universal significance in prompting the precise utilization of topographic models.The related data and code will be open-sourced in the community."

 The new Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) altimeter mission, launched on December 16, 2022, marked a significant leap in ocean topography measurement by transitioning from traditional nadir-looking altimetry to wide-swath interferometric radar altimetry. During its 3-month fast-sampling phase from March 29 to July 9, 2023, SWOT operated on a 1-day repeat orbit focused on calibration and validation. Currently, SWOT is operating in its science phase on a 21-day repeat orbit. This study uses the Version C Level 2 Ka-band Radar Interferometer data in the South China Sea, collected during the SWOT fast-sampling phase, to validate SWOT’s performance in recovering marine gravity fields. The 95 cycles of fast-sampling phase data are equivalent to about 5.5 years of data from the science phase, offering sufficient repeat data to evaluate the potential of SWOT for deriving long-term, stacked marine gravity fields. We outline optimal processing strategies for refining SWOT sea surface heights (SSHs) to derive marine gravity anomalies. These strategies include rejecting outliers, mitigating ocean variability by removing sea level anomaly, correcting tilts across the entire SWOT swath segment using a three-dimensional plane, and averaging geoid gradients to reduce random errors. This study introduces a new method, the least-squares adjustment (LSA), for estimating the north and east components of the geoid gradient from SWOT SSH data. The gravity anomalies derived from the gradient components determined using the LSA method show comparable accuracy to those using least-squares collocation (LSC), with values of 2.32 mgal versus 2.28 mgal, respectively. Moreover, the LSA method is more computationally efficient than LSC. SWOT demonstrates the capability to derive north and east gradient components and marine gravity fields at finer scales compared to conventional altimeters, particularly over rough seafloor areas where SWOT can observe high-wavenumber SSHs. SWOT reveals continental shelf margins more clearly than conventional altimeters. Marine gravity anomalies from 3 months of SWOT data have an accuracy of 2.28 mGal, which is 12% better than the accuracy achieved with 14 years of data from conventional nadir altimeters. The gravity recovery procedures developed using SWOT fast-sampling phase data can be extended to derive optimal local and global marine gravity fields during the mission’s science phase."

 Satellite hyperspectral imagery (SHSI) provides detailed biochemical and physical characteristics of forest canopies, making it crucial for mapping large-scale tree species. However, two main challenges limit its effectiveness: (1) the spatial resolution of SHSI restricts its applicability in subtropical regions, where tree species diversity is high, and (2) the complexity of spectral data and structural variability complicates seasonal feature extraction. Most existing methods are focused on drone data and struggle to effectively integrate the multiscale temporal, spatial, and spectral information inherent in satellite-based hyperspectral data. To address these challenges, we enhance ZY1-02E hyperspectral data via a superresolution technique that incorporates Sentinel-2 data. We then propose TS2GNet, a novel hyperspectral classification network that integrates temporal-, spatial-, and spectral-domain guidance. TS2GNet employs a dual-stream architecture that focus on dynamic interactions between spatial and spectral domains, while also incorporating temporal modeling and SHSI feature-domain guidance. We evaluate our method on eight dominant tree species in the Ta-pieh Mountains and compare its performance with six state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning-based hyperspectral classification methods. The results demonstrate that (1) the enhanced ZY1-02E data lead to 1.93 %-to-3.47 % seasonal overall accuracy (OA) improvements; (2) TS2GNet consistently outperforms the other methods, achieving OA improvements ranging from 6.02 % to 6.36 % across different seasons; and (3) by incorporating multiseasonal SHSI features, TS2GNet increases OA from 86.81 ± 0.46 % to 90.72 ± 0.60 %, surpassing the other models by 2.77 % to 6.29 %. Additionally, TS2GNet demonstrates strong generalizability when applied to Sentinel-2 data. These findings advance satellite-based hyperspectral remote sensing methodologies and offer new insights into tree species distribution mapping in complex forest ecosystems.The codes associated with this paper are publicly available at https://github.com/FRS-HFUT/TS2GNet."

 Co-occurrence can improve the perception and prediction of traffic entities by predicting another traffic entity in automated driving based on a known entity. Existing traffic entity co-occurrence relationship construction methods use a bottom-up approach that relies on labeled datasets. However, the limited nature of datasets constrains the capture of long-tail scenarios. High-definition (HD) maps define the concept of traffic elements and their classifications, and can be used for scene simulation and real-time updating of digital twins. Based on this, this paper proposes a knowledge graph construction method for traffic entity prediction, employing a top-down approach and introducing HD maps. This method establishes a co-occurring semantic network between entities, utilizing prior knowledge. The objective is to reconcile the finiteness of datasets with the infinity of long-tailed scenarios, thereby providing a theoretical basis for the safety calibration of autonomous driving. The experimental results show that the knowledge graph constructed by the top-down method has a complete ontology type in the schema and takes into account the co-occurrence relations of the long-tailed scenarios, which provides a basis for the standardization of the co-occurrence relationships of the long-tailed scenarios, and also provides semantic support for the dynamic simulation of the digital twins in traffic scenes."

 This study presents an innovative solution for detecting complex geological formations, particularly in areas where field surveys are difficult or impossible. Even when feasible, conventional surveys often fail to delineate subtle lithological transitions without extensive laboratory analysis, which alone cannot define spatial distribution. We interpreted the geology of an inaccessible limestone quarry using an integrated approach combining petrographic, chemical, and spectral analyses with close-range hyperspectral remote sensing. Petrographic and chemical analyses revealed that the outcrop was significantly altered by igneous intrusion, resulting in distinct mineralogical and lithological transitions within both igneous and carbonate bodies. Late-stage magmatic and hydrothermal activity produced four discrete igneous phases and widespread metasomatism. Hydrothermal alteration caused extensive dolomitization, transforming the original limestone units. These transitions are characterized by calcite and sericite formations in igneous rocks and quartz in carbonate rocks. Spectrally, dyke displayed Al-OH absorption indicative of plagioclase and sericite, while metasomatic interactions introduced secondary calcite with additional CO32– absorption. Dolomitization is further distinguished by Mg-OH absorption features. A 3D-CNNs model combined with spectral normalization effectively mapped these transition lithologies, clearly revealing the geological processes imprinted in the outcrop. Most dykes show intensive metasomatic, with only core portions retain pure igneous signatures. Limestones are concentrated near dyke contacts, suggesting marble formation via contact metamorphism, while dolostone dominated the outcrop due to regional dolomitization. The mapping results provide a preliminary resource assessment indicating that igneous intrusion has reduced the economic value by approximately 80% compared to pure limestone. This integrated approach accurately represents gradational lithological boundaries, addressing the limitations of conventional survey methods."

 We performed the estimation at two boreal forest areas in Finland, Valtimo and Pello, using two methods: post-classification and logistic regression estimation. In post-classification, dominant height and canopy cover were estimated first, and areas where dominant height was (≥ 5 m) and canopy cover (≥ 10%) were considered forested. In the second method, logistic regression was used to determine the areas with tree cover using ICESat-2 variables as predictors. The reference values were obtained using airborne laser scanning data and locally measured field plots. The transferability of the ICESat-2 models was also assessed.Our results indicated that ICESat-2 data are suitable for the estimation of tree cover extent over large areas. The overall accuracy ranged from 92% to 95% both for post-classification and logistic regression, depending on the study area. Although the performance of the two classification methods was similar, the classification accuracies were generally lower in Pello. The ICESat-2 models for dominant height and canopy cover had RMSE% values of 21.1–24.5% and 24.9–36.8%, respectively.

 Global coastal suspended sediment concentration (SSC) plays a crucial role in regulating erosion, accretion, and geomorphological evolution. Although traditional remote sensing offers broad spatiotemporal coverage, high-resolution SSC retrieval remains challenging due to the lack of in situ calibration data. We propose a transfer-based human–machine collaborative learning approach that embeds expert knowledge to significantly reduce reliance on field data. The approach follows the Human-in-the-Loop paradigm and begins by integrating limited in situ samples with expert-labeled SSC regions from Sentinel-MODIS (2017–2024) imagery to construct an initial training set, where SMOTE is applied to address class imbalance. Expert feedback is then used to identify and correct misclassified areas, and the resulting high-confidence samples are incrementally incorporated to reconstruct local training subsets. Finally, expert-informed feature adjustment and geometric priors are integrated through hierarchical transfer learning, enabling the model to iteratively adapt with small-sample updates. Applied to China’s eastern coastal waters, the proposed approach demonstrates high predictive accuracy, explaining 95.1% of the variance in limited field observations. It identifies a 1.50% overall decline in SSC since 2017, primarily driven by reduced fluvial sediment input, while paradoxically revealing a 4.26% increase in the Yangtze Estuary due to anthropogenic shoreline modifications that enhance nearshore sediment retention. The model also captures climate-induced ocean stratification effects, which suppress vertical energy exchange, limiting sediment resuspension and lateral redistribution and thereby altering SSC distribution patterns. Overall, the approach enables accurate SSC retrieval under severe observational data scarcity, providing a scalable and transferable solution for sediment monitoring in optically complex coastal environments."

 Accurate classification of urban green spaces from high-resolution remotely sensed images is critical for ecological environment planning, construction, and utilization. However, existing deep learning networks for large-scale high-resolution remote sensing images often face limited receptive fields and insufficient extraction of global information, making it challenging to achieve satisfactory performance on urban green space classification tasks. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel dual-encoder network, termed GreenNet, specifically designed for urban green space classification from high-resolution remotely sensed images. GreenNet features a unique dual-encoder structure. i.e., an inside encoder for efficiently extracting interior intra-image (i.e., local and global) features of urban green spaces from the small-sized images cropped from raw input remote sensing images, and an outside encoder for modeling long dependencies (i.e., external inter-image features) from the large-sized images cropped from raw input images. Additionally, a transformer-based outside-global–local attention block (OGLAB) is developed to fuse the intra-image and inter-image features from the dual-encoder to effectively capture inherent semantic representations of urban green spaces. Finally, to ensure classification consistency along class boundaries, a boundary loss is computed using edge-defined images, which are generated by a pre-trained Segmenting Anything Model (SAM) from the raw input image. The proposed GreenNet was evaluated on a self-built urban green space dataset, covering the whole area of Nanshan District, Shenzhen City, China, achieving an overall accuracy (OA) of 88.88 %, a mean F1-score (mF1) of 74.06 %, and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 60.77 %, respectively, demonstrating its superior performance to state-of-the-art networks on green space classification tasks."

 Wood pellets have become a popular alternative to fossil fuels and are widely applied in many countries. On the EU market, the prices of high-quality wood pellets have increased dramatically due to the energy crisis resulting from the Russian-Ukrainian War. Cheaper alternatives include pelletized agro-biomass (e.g. cereal straw, miscanthus or sunflower husk). The aim of this study was to compare the chemical and mineralogical composition of three different solid combustion products—bottom ash, coarse dust, and fine dust fractions—generated during combustion of various biomass pellet types in standard domestic heating systems. The combustion of different biomass pellets was carried out in a low-power heating boiler. Distinct differences in inorganic elemental composition and mineralogy were observed between wood and non-wood biomass pellets. Significant differences were also noted between the fine dust fraction collected in the exhaust gas duct and the coarser combustion products. The latter ones were characterized by a predominance of Ca, primarily in the form of carbonates and sulfates. In contrast, the solid combustion products of straw, sunflower husks, and miscanthus contained potassium as the main component, accounting for 30–50 % of the composition. The fine dust from coniferous wood pellets was significantly enriched in potentially toxic metals such as Zn, Cu, Pb, and Cd, which could pose a serious threat to air quality in residential areas.

 Heatwaves are documented to exert significant impacts on both ecosystems and human societies. Ground-based observation of temperature could provide fundamental data to acquire heatwave characteristics like intensity, frequency and duration, but are challenging to get information about event-based spatial area. Meanwhile, Spatial and temporal gaps in observational heatwave records also receive increasing attention, but quantitative approaches remain lacking. Here we use the high-resolution air temperatures from the ERA5-Land reanalysis dataset (0.1° × 0.1) from 1950 to 2024, to acquire spatial scale of heatwave events using a spatiotemporally contiguous events tracking method. We compare spatial scale of heatwaves and the average distance of weather station network, which depicts the density, to address whether the station network is sufficient to capture heatwaves. The representativeness ratio was introduced as a metric describing how well the network density at a station captures nearby heatwave events in a given summer. We find the heatwaves at smaller scale (< 100 km) exhibit significant increase from 1950 to 2024, especially at nighttime. Meanwhile, there has been a continuously increase in the spatial density of worldwide weather stations. The coupling of these two trends drives spatially heterogeneous temporal evolutions of representativeness ratios in regional networks. The contiguous United States and Europe have consistently maintained high representativeness ratio (> 80 %), while some regions in South America and Africa exhibited poor representativeness ratio in the 1850s (< 20 %) but show significant improvement in recent periods (> 60 %).

Results indicate that most CMIP6 models can reasonably reproduce the dipole pattern of precipitation, with 28 models achieving a comprehensive Taylor skill score above 0.6. However, notable discrepancies exist between simulated and observed precipitation trends. While the models effectively replicate the increasing trend observed in the western part of northern China (WNC), they fail to simulate the decreasing trend observed in the eastern part of northern China (ENC), instead exhibiting an opposite increasing trend. Analysis of these discrepancies reveals significant model deviations in simulating key atmospheric circulation systems and their associated moisture and dynamic conditions influencing precipitation. Additionally, the models inadequately reproduce the predominant roles of evaporation and horizontal thermodynamic processes on precipitation highlighted by observation, contributing to the divergence in simulated versus observed precipitation trends. Further detection and attribution analyses demonstrate that the signal of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing is detectable in the increasing precipitation in WNC and can be distinguished from other external forcings.

To address these limitations, this study proposes a hybrid model that combines an NWP model with machine learning (ML) techniques designed for short-range weather prediction over Bihar, India. In this approach, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model generates high-resolution short-range weather predictions for surface parameters, while the ML-based techniques are employed to correct the forecast trajectory. Several ML algorithms have been explored and trained to learn temperature and humidity gradients effectively, and the most effective one has been selected for hybrid model development based on its performance. The hybrid model significantly improves forecast accuracy compared to the WRF model, reducing forecast biases and root-mean-square errors.

In the summer, autumn, and winter seasons, a direct relationship between FSD and precipitation anomalies in SESA was found through teleconnections via quasi-stationary Rossby waves of tropical origin associated with El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This means that El Niño-like conditions are associated with high FSD and positive precipitation anomalies, and La Niña-like conditions with low FSD and negative precipitation anomalies in SESA. While in spring, the relationship between FSD and ENSO is non-linear, with both high and low FSD seasons during El Niño-like conditions, no direct relationships between FSD and precipitation anomalies were found."

 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), oxygenated PAHs (OPAHs), and nitrophenols (NPs) are essential aromatic compounds that significantly affect both climate and human health. However, their sources and formation mechanisms, particularly for NPs, remain poorly understood. This study determined the concentration profiles and the main formation mechanisms of these substance classes in PM2.5 from Dongying, based on field observations and quantum chemical calculations. The daily concentrations of ∑13PAHs during heating were more than twice higher compared to those before the heating period. Benzo(b)fluoranthene was identified as the primary PAHs species. The average concentration of ∑8OPAHs reached 351 ng m−3, with significantly increased concentrations observed during the heating season (15 November–6 December 2021) wherein 1-Naphthaldehyde (1-NapA) emerged as the most prevalent OPAH species. Concentrations of ∑9NPs increased approximately 1.2 times during the heating, with 4-methyl-5-nitrocatechol (4M5NC) having the highest concentration. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis identified biomass burning to be the primary source of these aromatic compounds, particularly for PAHs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further revealed that phenol and nitrobenzene are two main primary precursors for 4-nitrophenol, with phenol showing lower reaction barriers, and P-Cresol was identified as the primary precursor for the formation of 4M5NC. This study provides the first detailed investigation of the sources and formation mechanisms of aromatic compounds in the atmosphere of petrochemical cities, using Dongying in the Yellow River Delta as a representative case study. This investigation may provide fundamental insights and important guidance for reducing emissions of aromatic compounds in similar atmospheric environments."

The observed H2O2 showed distinct diurnal variations influenced by photochemical reactions. A box model revealed that H2O2 is primarily produced by HO2 recombination and removed mainly via particle uptake. Reductions in NOx, PM2.5, and alkanes raised H2O2 levels, while cutting alkenes, aromatics, CO, and HONO lowered them. A dual strategy focusing on VOC and NOx control is essential to reduce both H2O2 and ozone pollution. 
 Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a key atmospheric oxidant, crucial for oxidation capacity and sulfate production. However, its chemistry remains understudied compared to ozone (O3), limiting our understanding of photochemical pollution. In summer 2016, atmospheric peroxides and trace gases were measured at a rural site in the North China Plain. H2O2 was the dominant peroxide (0.62 ± 0.80 ppb), constituting 69 % of total peroxides. It exhibited diurnal variation similar to peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) and O3, indicating photochemical production. The O3/H2O2 ratio was higher on high-particle days, suggesting that H2O2 uptake by particles reduces its concentration. A box model with default gas-phase chemistry overestimated H2O2 by a factor of 2.7, and including particle uptake of H2O2 (uptake coefficient of 6 × 10−4) improved agreement with observations, although we note that this value carries some uncertainty related to the assumed HO2 uptake coefficient.HO2 recombination contributed 91 % of H2O2 production, with a peak rate of 1 ppb h−1. Major removal pathways included particle uptake (69 %), dry deposition (25 %), OH reaction (4 %), and photolysis (2 %). Relative incremental reactivity (RIR) analysis showed that reducing NOx, PM2.5, and alkanes increased H2O2, while reducing alkenes, aromatics, CO, and HONO decreased it, with alkenes having the strongest effect. H2O2/NOz ratios (>0.15 in 82 % of cases) indicated that O3 formation was in a transition and NOx-sensitive regime, emphasizing the need for further volatile organic compound (VOC) and NOx reductions to mitigate both H2O2 and O3 pollution. These findings improve our understanding of H2O2 chemistry and provide insights into the mitigation of photochemical pollution in rural North China."

SmHOLIMO is designed to specifically measure small cloud droplets with diameters > 3.7 μm. This way we retrieve accurate cloud droplet size distributions, which are crucial to understand the evolution and governing microphysical processes of a cloud. Results of a field study are compared to co-located measurements of a second holographic imager, microwave radiometer, and cloud radar. 
 The microstructure of liquid and mixed-phase clouds is characterized by the cloud droplet size distribution (CDSD), which influences the cloud evolution and its interaction with radiation. However, state-of-the-art cloud probes still face challenges because they require either platforms that move at constant speed or inlets that can directly alter the actual CDSD. Therefore, precise and accurate in situ measurements of CDSDs, especially of cloud droplets smaller than 6 µm, are still lacking. This can lead to uncertainties in the microphysics and thus in weather and climate models, which are based on parameterizations often derived from these measurements.We present a new in situ instrument, the Small Holographic Imager for Microscopic Objects (SmHOLIMO), specifically designed to measure a broad spectrum of the CDSDs, i.e., from 3.7 to ≈100 µm, with a sample volume rate of 2.5 cm3 s−1. Thereby, SmHOLIMO pushes the resolution limit towards the limits seen with forward-scattering probes, while still maintaining the advantages of open-path holography, i.e., a well-defined sample volume (operation at variable wind speed); no need for an inlet; independence of particle size, phase, refractive index, and shape; and the potential of spatial analyses. After calibrating SmHOLIMO in the laboratory, the instrument was deployed in the field, on a tethered balloon system, probing a dissipating low stratus. We demonstrate its ability to measure the cloud microphysical properties at high spatio-temporal resolution. Furthermore, we compare the SmHOLIMO observations to those of another holographic imager (resolution: 6 µm) and to co-located remote sensing measurements. We unequivocally show the importance of SmHOLIMO's skills to capture the lower tail of the CDSD, which significantly affects the derived quantities of cloud droplet mean diameter (up to 1.6 times smaller), number concentration (up to 4 times higher), and cloud optical depth (up to 2.7 times higher). SmHOLIMO's high-resolution in situ data of cloud droplets will help us to better interpret observations and to refine the representation of clouds in climate and weather models."

Because aquatic plants like hydrophyte natantia can effectively remove pollutants via photosynthesis-powered rhizoextraction and phytotransformation, they are widely applied in outdoor water purification; however, their performance in degrading recalcitrant PPCPs remains inefficient. Here, we develop a synthetic hydrophyte that mimics the main features of a natural hydrophyte: photosynthesis (leaves), pollutant degradation (stem), and pollutant extraction (root). CoOx/Mo:BiVO4/Pd artificial leaves photosynthesize hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is subsequently activated in the FeOCl artificial stem, generating powerful hydroxyl radicals (•OH) that rapidly degrade pollutants extracted by the poly(vinylidene fluoride) artificial root. The synthetic hydrophyte demonstrates remarkable degradation rates of 85.0–99.5% for multiple recalcitrant PPCP pollutants within 8 h, which are typically resistant to phytoremediation. In outdoor tests, the pollutant removal efficiency of the synthetic hydrophyte surpassed those of Hydrocotyle verticillata and Canna indica by 8.6–16.1-fold. Moreover, synthetic hydrophytes exhibit distinct advantages of high versatility under various pH, temperature, and water matrix conditions. The promising sunlight-driven water purification achieved by the synthetic hydrophyte sheds light on a new approach for achieving both efficient and sustainable removal of recalcitrant PPCPs that are increasingly detected in natural waters."

Microplastic particles are known to serve as a vector for the transport of microbes (fungi and bacteria) to new environments, threatening biodiversity. Robust biofilm formation makes fungi candidates for collecting and remediating environmental microplastics. However, fungal-microplastic colonization mechanisms have not yet been explored. In this work, we aim to understand which fungal molecules mediate microplastic binding. We examine the common fungal genus Aspergillus, which we found binds microplastics tightly, removing particles from suspension. Upon inoculation of Aspergilli with microplastic particles, up to 3.85 ± 1.48 g of microplastics were flocculated per gram of dry fungal biomass; this phenomenon was observed across various plastics ranging in size from 0.05 to 5 mm. Gene knockouts revealed that hydrophobins drive microplastic-fungi binding, evidenced by a decrease in flocculation relative to that of wild-type Aspergillus fumigatus. Moreover, purified hydrophobins flocculated microplastics independently of the fungus, validating their ability to bind to microplastics. Our work elucidates a role for hydrophobins in fungal colonization of microplastics and highlights a target for mitigating the harm of microplastics through engineered fungal-microplastic interactions."

In this study, we found that parental exposure to BPS at environmental doses induced lipid accumulation in Caenorhabditis elegans from one-generational parent (P0) to two-generational offspring (F2), even in the absence of BPS exposure in offspring. Mechanistically, BPS-induced transgenerational lipid accumulation was due to the activation of lipogenic genes (fat-5 and fat-7, encoding delta-9 desaturases) and the associated transcriptional regulators (sbp-1 and mdt-15). Knockdown of methyltransferase wdr-5.1 reversed  BPS-induced transgenerational inheritance via inhibiting histone H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3). Interestingly, germline-specific wdr-5.1/H3K4me3, rather than intestinal, was identified as being responsible for transgenerational inheritance.

Traditional risk assessments focus exclusively on single Cd contamination and total dietary intake, neglecting the interactions between them and the digestion and adsorption processes in the human body. This study established a novel benefit–risk-value (BRV) criterion to assess coexposure effects. Besides, we compared existing single-element risk assessment criteria and evaluated changes in risk before and after the incorporation of bioaccessibility using in vitro simulation. Rice constituted the major exposure source for Cd, whereas Se intake primarily relied on meat and rice. Integrating bioaccessibility with traditional risk assessment criteria significantly reduced the health risks associated with Cd exposure, while revealing notable Se deficiency in adults and seniors. Different from traditional models, BRV analysis indicated that children were safe from Cd and Se exposure, whereas adults and the seniors suffered from Se deficiency. As a biomarker, hair further validated the feasibility of the new standard. Correlation analysis demonstrates an age-dependent decline in the molar ratio of Se to Cd in hair samples. This study reveals that the mitigation of Se on Cd toxicity may contribute to Se deficiency."

Using experimental evolution with copper selection and subsequent relaxation, we investigated how density-dependent processes interact with contaminant stress in shaping adaptive responses of the freshwater zooplankton Ceriodaphnia cornuta. Elevated population densities significantly accelerated adaptive evolution to copper, as evidenced by increased population growth rates and reduced plasticity under stress. These changes were accompanied by shifts in multilocus genotype composition, indicating selection for copper-tolerant genotypes. Copper-adapted populations retained their fitness advantage after the stressor was removed, likely due to the fixation of tolerance alleles with low fitness costs and the canalization of adaptive traits through reduced plasticity. Our findings show that population density not only alters the speed of evolution but also shapes the evolutionary pathway and persistence of adaptive change. By integration of ecological and evolutionary perspectives, this study underscores the importance of density-dependent selection in mediating species responses to anthropogenic stressors."

The challenges of low mass transfer in sediments and the recalcitrance of NACs to degradation limit the effectiveness of conventional bioremediation techniques. This study demonstrates the potential of alternating current (AC)-driven bioredox cycling to overcome these barriers by coupling in situ reduction-oxidation processes. We report the successful application of AC stimulation in achieving the mineralization of nitrobenzene (NB) while elucidating its role in modulating bioredox dynamics, electron transfer, and electromicrobiome function. Sine-wave AC stimulation achieved an 87.7% reduction of NB and 90.3% mineralization of its intermediates. The AC stimulation promoted robust biofilm formation, enhanced bidirectional electrocatalytic activity, and increased microbial biomass. It also enriched a diverse microbial consortium capable of reducing NB, oxidizing aromatic intermediates, and facilitating electron transfer, as indicated by the upregulation of key enzymatic genes through multiomics analyses. Carbon metabolites from catechol meta-cleavage further supported nitro-reduction and sustained microbial viability. Compared to DC processes, AC-driven bioredox cycling reduced energy consumption by 16.8% in the remediation of NB-contaminated sediments.

Rigid wall columns are widely used to study MP transport in soil. However, they are limited in their ability to control boundary conditions and prevent sidewall leakage in studying low-permeability soils. Flexible wall permeameters (FWPs), commonly used for measuring soil permeability, offer more precise control of confining pressure and leakage, making them a promising alternative that remains under-explored. This study evaluates FWPs for MP transport through mass-balance experiments to assess the extent to which the artificial retention of MP by FWP may interfere with testing and reduce its validity. Tests are conducted under different FWP components, pressure gradients, ionic strengths of solution, and MP sizes and concentrations. Results show baseline mass recoveries greater than 80% but declining for larger MPs (5 μm) and high ionic strengths. Agglomeration and filtration by filter paper were the primary causes of retention. Overall, FWPs proved effective for studying MP transport for particles of ≤1 μm at ionic strengths smaller than 0.03 M, with near-complete recovery achieved when avoiding filter papers. In addition, MP flow-through experiments conducted on sandy and bentonite clay soil samples confirmed FWP suitability as a soil column.

K isotopes, therefore, have the potential to trace anthropogenic processes. Huguangyan Maar Lake (HML), a hydrologically enclosed lake, provides an ideal setting to preserve the historical records of anthropogenic activities. This study investigated the K contents and isotopic compositions (δ41K) in recent HML sediments to trace catchment K cycling and human impacts over the past 120 years in southern China. Results show that leachate K (Kleachate) is influenced by coal combustion, while residue K (Kresidue) is mainly derived from bedrock erosion. Prior to 1950 C.E., the HML catchment experienced minimal human disturbance, as indicated by stable K contents and δ41K values. Between 1950 and 2000 C.E., increasing Kresidue contents suggest intensified catchment erosion due to human activities following the founding of the People’s Republic of China, though direct anthropogenic inputs remained limited. After 2000 C.E., fluctuations and decreasing δ41Kleachate values reflect varying air pollution from anthropogenic activities such as coal combustion and vehicle emissions associated with industrialization and subsequent environmental policies.

While this plaque has been implicated in soil organic carbon (SOC) transformation, its specific role in regulating SOC mineralization is still insufficiently understood. In this study, we hypothesize that Fe plaque induces the generation of hydroxyl radicals (•OH), which disrupt the “enzyme latch” mechanism and promote CO2 emissions. The results showed that seedlings with Fe plaque showed a 150% higher •OH concentration, 50% higher laccase activity, 25% higher SOC mineralization rate, and 20% lower phenolic concentration in comparison to those without Fe plaque. These effects disappeared when a •OH scavenger was applied or oxygen availability was reduced. Moreover, the exogenous addition of Fe(II) in Fe plaque-free soils reproduced the increases in •OH, laccase activity, and SOC mineralization, confirming the role of Fe-driven •OH production. These findings demonstrate that Fe plaque-induced •OH simultaneously disrupts phenolic inhibition and accelerates SOC mineralization. This study identifies a previously underappreciated oxidative mechanism by which Fe plaque destabilizes SOC in paddy soils and highlights the role of mineral–radical interactions in controlling carbon turnover."

In this work, we investigated the biotransformation of 6PPD and 6PPD-Q in soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). We identified 9 transformation products (TPs) of 6PPD and 26 of 6PPD-Q using suspect and nontargeted screening methods, providing the first comprehensive metabolic profile of these contaminants in soil nematodes. Novel in vivo metabolites including phosphorylated and monohydroxy phosphorylated 6PPD-Q were first discovered, revealing unique metabolic pathways of these contaminants in C. elegans compared to other eukaryotes. Kinetic profiling delineates heterogeneous temporal patterns among TPs, with specific derivatives showing progressive accumulation over the exposure duration. Notably, isomers such as dihydroxy 6PPD-Q exhibit distinct substitution-site-dependent dynamics. Furthermore, in silico toxicity prediction indicated that certain TPs exhibited earthworm toxicity comparable to 6PPD-Q, implying potential contributions to the discernible adverse effects observed in C. elegans.

Fluorine-19 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (19F-NMR) is an inclusive method for total and class-based organofluorine analysis. Here, we apply 19F-NMR to 31 effluent, surface water, and foam samples collected at 13 potential organofluorine point sources or source regions and compare the results to targeted LC-MS/MS for 34 or 64 PFASs. LC-MS/MS detected a median of 11.4% of total organofluorine detected by 19F-NMR (range: nondetect to 8190 nM F 19F-NMR; nondetect to 8010 nM F LC-MS/MS). The highest 19F-NMR total organofluorine concentrations, detected in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP)-associated foam and at a soy oil production facility, arose from resonances characteristic of per- and polyfluorinated alkyl chains. 19F-NMR resonances from aryl CF3 moieties were abundant in the WWTP-associated samples, consistent with prior reports of substantial contributions from pharmaceuticals to WWTP effluents. 19F-NMR enables the quantitative assessment of total organofluorine and qualitative insight into fluorinated structures, providing complementary analysis of organofluorine compounds missed by targeted mass spectrometry-based protocols."

While effect-directed analysis (EDA) combined with nontarget screening (NTS) is promising, its large-scale application has been limited by time-consuming workflows. Here, we developed an event-driven taxonomy (EDT)-Screening strategy to effectively identify and semiquantify nontarget bioactive contaminants in sediment, taking aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activity as an example. To accelerate EDA and NTS workflows, this strategy integrated fractionation, bioassay, identification, and quantification into a single step by embedding two novel effect-based spectral libraries into LC-HRMS screening templates. The event driver (ED) library was assembled from data-mined AhR-active compounds, and the event driver ion (EDION) library contained effect-related fragment ions predicted by deep learning. Compared to conventional databases (e.g., ChemSpider), the AhR-ED library improved identification accuracy with a more complete AhR-agonist list and fewer false positives, while the AhR-EDION library uncovered additional AhR agonists, particularly industrial intermediates and transformation products often missed due to limited prior knowledge. With the multimodal learning-based semiquantitative module, the EDT-Screening strategy increased the explained bioactivity contribution from 7.1% to 82%, significantly expanding the detections of “unknown unknowns”. Our findings show that effect-based HRMS libraries provided a rapid solution for identifying and prioritizing bioactive contaminants in complex chemical mixtures, advancing EDA-NTS workflows for environmental risk assessment."

Miller;Briana Aguila-Ames,Interfacial Hydrophilicity Controls Mineral Transformation Outcomes for Enstatite and Amorphous MgSiO3,"Subsurface injection of carbon dioxide (CO2) into mafic-ultramafic rocks for permanent storage via mineralization is being studied to reduce emissions. We investigated the carbonation products of enstatite (MgSiO3) to assess its efficiency in sequestering CO2 for safe and permanent storage as carbonate minerals. This was accomplished by conducting variable temperature carbonation reactions with samples of differing crystallinities and surface chemistries. Reaction progress was monitored utilizing in situ X-ray diffraction, and the presence of carbonate products was confirmed using additional techniques, such as thermogravimetric analysis coupled with mass spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectrometry. Our results show that crystalline enstatite produces small amounts of the anhydrous form of MgCO3 (magnesite), while amorphous MgSiO3, which was used to simulate mafic glass, more readily converts to the hydrated/hydroxylated hydromagnesite [Mg5(CO3)4(OH)2·4H2O]. These results, supplemented with dynamic vapor sorption experiments, suggest that surface properties play a significant role in the pathway and degree of carbonation. These developments concerning the reactivity of CO2 with reactive mafic phases will help further our understanding of the reactivity of these mafic-ultramafic minerals with implications for permanent carbon storage and other subsurface engineering scenarios involving reactive reservoirs."

Jimenez,Mitigation of Indoor Air Pollution from Air Cleaners Using a Catalyst,"The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of indoor air quality and the role of airborne transmission in the disease spread. Heightened public awareness led to an increase in the commercialization and use of air cleaners. While several of these devices effectively disinfect the air, some also initiate chemical reactions that can worsen indoor air quality by generating ozone (O3) and other harmful air pollutants. Here we demonstrate the use of a MnOx-based catalyst to mitigate both air cleaner-generated and ambient pollution in a university office. We deployed two real-time chemical ionization mass spectrometers alongside a suite of air quality analyzers to measure a wide range of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), other trace gases, and particles. We show the reduction of many indoor pollutants in a combination of real indoor environment and atmospheric chamber experiments, including O3, nitrogen oxides, formaldehyde, and other oxidized VOCs. We observed an increase in the concentrations of more reduced VOCs with catalyst use. We demonstrate that over 24 weeks of continuous operation, the clean air delivery rate of the catalyst for O3 pollution declined linearly by 20%. These findings suggest that employing a dedicated catalyst could reduce indoor air pollution and enhance the human health benefits of air cleaners by minimizing the associated indoor air quality risks."

However, causal evidence is needed to confirm the respiratory effects associated with heat exposure and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. We conducted a randomized crossover trial among healthy adults in Shanghai, China. Participants received 2 h exposures to moderate-temperature (22 °C) and high-temperature (32 °C) conditions. Spirometry tests, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) measurements, and collections of pharyngeal secretion and peripheral blood samples were performed before and after each session. Pharyngeal microbiota was analyzed via 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Serum biomarkers, including Clara cell protein (CC16) and Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40) were also measured. Heat exposure was associated with decreases of 18.8% (95% CI: 4.7%, 32.8%) in peak expiratory flow, 9.6% (95% CI: 1.9%, 17.3%) in forced expiratory volume in the first second, and 8.8% (95% CI: 3.5%, 14.1%) in the ratio of forced expiratory volume in the first second and forced vital capacity. Corresponding increases were observed in FeNO (13.9%; 95% CI: 3.5%, 24.2%), serum CC16 (20.4%, 95% CI: 1.6%, 39.3%), and serum YKL-40 (17.1%, 95% CI: 3.9%, 30.2%).

Several observed extreme rainfall (ER) events are accompanied by high GrIS surface melt. However, their role in surface energy budgets and the associated physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we employ a surface energy balance (SEB) model to quantify the relative contributions of energy terms to surface melt energy (Qm) during ER events at QAS_L and QAS_U stations in southern GrIS. We further investigate the energy anomalies in terms of synoptic‐scale atmospheric conditions during ER events lasting three or more days (ER+3d). Our results indicate that during ER+3d events, nonradiative energy contributes 54% of Qm at QAS_L, near the ice sheet margin, with turbulent fluxes serving as the primary energy source. In contrast, at QAS_U, closer to the equilibrium line, Qm remains dominated by radiative energy, accounting for 61% of Qm. The contribution of rainfall heat flux remains small, at approximately 4% at QAS_L and 2% at QAS_U. Rainfall‐related atmospheric conditions trigger positive anomalies in turbulent fluxes and net radiation, due to strengthened cloud radiative forcing and increased turbulence scales in the near surface, which collectively contribute to high surface melt during ER+3d events. Therefore, the increased rainfall events have the potential to exacerbate surface mass loss by adding excess radiative and turbulent energy inputs in the future."

 Deep Convective Systems (DCSs) reaching scales of 100–1000 km play a pivotal role as the primary precipitation source in the tropics. Those systems can have large cloud shields, and thus not only affect severe precipitation patterns but also play a crucial part in modulating the tropical radiation budget. Understanding the complex factors that control how these systems grow and how they will behave in a warming climate remain fundamental challenges. Research efforts have been directed, on one hand, towards understanding the environmental control on these systems, and on the other hand, towards exploring the internal potential of systems to develop and self-aggregate in idealized simulations. However, we still lack understanding on the relative role of the environment and internal feedbacks on DCS mature size and why. The novel high-resolution global SAM simulation from the DYAMOND project, combined with the TOOCAN Lagrangian tracking of DCSs and machine learning tools, offers an unprecedented opportunity to explore this question. We find that a system’s growth rate during the first 2 h of development predicts its final size with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.65. Beyond this period, growth rate emerges as the strongest predictor. However, in the early stages, additional factors–such as ice water path heterogeneity, migration distance, interactions with neighboring systems, and deep shear–play a more significant role. Our study quantitatively assesses the relative influence of internal versus external factors on the mature cloud shield size. Our results show that system-intrinsic properties exert a stronger influence than environmental conditions, suggesting that the initial environment does not strictly constrain final system size, particularly for larger systems where internal dynamics dominate."

 The ongoing energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables is increasing the demand for materials, particularly metals. As fossil fuel infrastructure, such as refineries, tankers, pipelines, and ships, is phased out, this obsolete infrastructure could serve as an urban mine, supplying secondary materials like steel, aluminium, and copper. However, the extent to which these materials can meet future needs remains unclear and is often overlooked. Here we develop the global dynamic fossil fuel material model to quantify material stocks embedded in fossil fuel infrastructure and project secondary material availability through 2050 under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2 (SSP2) baseline and 2-degree Celsius (2D) scenarios. Our findings indicate that material demand for new infrastructure continues to grow under the baseline scenario and exceeds recoverable volumes.

 Integrating of carbon capture, utilization, and storage with poverty alleviation strategies presents an innovative and sustainable development paradigm. Regional poverty, often exacerbated by challenging geographical conditions, can be transformed into opportunities for carbon storage development, promoting energy and economic rebalancing while avoiding poverty and resource traps. By introducing an evaluation index grounded in Sustainable Development Goals and technical requirements, we achieve a harmonious balance between potential and economic development. Techno-economic analysis in coal plant renovation and oil field projects demonstrates this project triggers a 7.70% growth in local gross domestic product per capita, and a decrease of 4.85% in local carbon dioxide emissions. Construction costs in impoverished regions can be over 20% lower than in more affluent areas for projects of the same scale because of cheaper labor and lower transportation and storage costs, highlighting the cost-effectiveness of pursuing poverty alleviation through carbon capture, utilization, and storage in China. This paper also emphasized the carbon storage demand in future’s energy transition of China. The status of policy implementation underscored the significant potential of carbon capture, utilization, and storage in contributing to poverty alleviation in the world’s largest carbon emitter and developing country, potentially serving as a critical testbed globally.

 Disentangling pathogen infection signals in plants is critical for understanding the physiological processes that underlie the complex host-pathogen interactions and predicting impending disease outbreak. The rapid progression of rice blast lesions, caused by the filamentous fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, and its imperceptible disease-related symptoms during the asymptomatic stages render real-time detection and visualization challenging. Efforts to reveal pre-visual disease symptoms are of both broad concern and significant interest but remain challenging, as subtle disease signals are often obscured or diluted by other factors at asymptomatic stage. We introduce an imaging spectroscopy-based purification methodology that isolates the disease signals revealed by spectral unmixing on a pixel basis without considering the complex pathogen-induced physiological variations. With multi-temporal proximal hyperspectral imagery, our method captured the transition of disease lesions from asymptomatic to severely symptomatic stages, and successfully distinguished the subtle pathogen-induced signals with few false alarms as early as three days (two days after inoculation, DAI 2) before visual lesions became apparent (DAI 5). The lesion prediction results were confirmed by extensive in vivo visual inspections. Remarkably, we demonstrated that spatially aggregating the isolated disease signals improved the accuracy of pre-visual RB identification to a remarkable level up to 93 % (F1-score = 0.91), enabling unprecedented visualization of potential lesions in a narrow time window of pathogen infection. Although limitations remain regarding model validation and scalability for broader applications, this method represents a significant advancement in early disease forecasting across spectral and spatial domains, and offers new opportunities for high-throughput screening of susceptible varieties in next-generation plant resilience phenotyping."

 This paper presents an algorithm for mapping tree height from L-band spaceborne synthetic aperture radar measurements. The proposed tree height retrieval algorithm integrates dual-polarimetric (HH, HV) backscatter and interferometric coherence time series using a model-based approach. Physics-based models relate radar backscatter and interferometric temporal coherence to forest properties and capture the varying environmental conditions over time. These models are calibrated using lidar measurements, and then jointly inverted to retrieve vegetation height at the pixel level. The algorithm is evaluated using a time series of 6 dual-polarimetric ALOS-2 acquisitions over the Lenoir Landing (AL) site, supported by high-resolution lidar data, weather measurements, and the land cover map from the National Land Cover Database. Over the study area, temporal coherence alone proves reliable for estimating forest height, with varying performance depending on vegetation height and class. Comparison with lidar-derived tree height confirms that integrating multi-temporal interferometric coherence and backscatter significantly improves the estimation performance compared to using backscatter time series alone. In particular, incorporating interferometric coherence extends the dynamic range of the estimated tree heights, overcoming the saturation of backscatter signals for tall vegetation. The algorithm is applicable to repeated radar acquisitions collected within a narrow orbital tube and represents an opportunity to map forest properties with upcoming and future low-frequency radar missions."

 Current deep learning-based remote sensing methods for photovoltaic (PV) power stations identification primarily focus on inland high-irradiance areas, but exhibit significant limitations in accurately delineating boundary of multi-scale PV power stations in coastal regions. This challenge arises due to frequent cloud and fog coverage in coastal areas, leading to spectral confusion in optical images and complicating accurate PV extraction. To address this issue, this study proposes SolarSegNet, a multimodal semantic segmentation network integrating Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 multispectral images (MSI) data. SolarSegNet consists of three modules: The adaptive depth separable (ADS) module for local detailed feature extraction, the global-local awareness block (GLAB) for capturing global context, and the adaptive high-frequency awareness block (AHFAB) to mitigate cloud interference. Experiments comparing ten multi-source data combinations indicated that the visible-spectral index-SAR scheme performed optimally. Training and comparative experiments on the newly constructed PV benchmark dataset demonstrated that SolarSegNet significantly improved segmentation accuracy (with IoU, Precision, and Recall enhanced by 1.49%, 0.89%, and 0.90%, respectively) and reduced computational complexity (with parameters decreased by 165.5M and FLOPS reduced by 77.52G).

 Vertical wind shear frequently occurs in complex terrain (basin and sloped terrain). However, compared with thermodynamic (temperature inversion) variables, the modulation of dynamic (wind shear) variables on air pollution is poorly understood due to scarce in-situ observations at complex terrain. In order to reveal the issues, we conducted the first collaborative field experiment of Boundary-Layer Meteorology and Pollution at western Sichuan Basin (BLMP-SCB) at a rural site from December 2018 to January 2019. A clockwise turning of the wind with the height was more frequent, especially for the rotation smaller than 20 degrees, which corresponded to the heavy air pollution near the ground surface. The surface heavy air pollution was jointly influenced by both low-level wind-directional shear and speed shear above that layer, especially the configuration of southeasterly winds below 1.0 km above sea level (regional transport) and increased southwesterly winds with height above the height (subsidence motion). The elevated wind-directional shear enhanced mechanical turbulence to transport downwards secondary pollutants to upper atmospheric boundary layer from the higher layer of air. The increased wind speed with height more easily triggered subsidence motion to trap more pollutants inside the basin. The work was helpful for fully understanding the role of meteorological variables in the formation and development of heavy air pollution at complex terrain, which will be favorable for making targeted pollution prevention and control measures at complex terrain."

 Climate change has intensified extreme droughts and strong winds in arid and semi-arid regions, accelerating soil wind erosion, dust emissions, and related environmental problems. Wind is the primary driver of soil wind erosion, with both speed and cumulative duration determining the intensity of the erosion process. Accurately characterizing regional wind speed and its cumulative duration is therefore essential for understanding the spatial distribution of soil wind erosion. Previous studies have mainly relied on weather station observations; however, their limited coverage, low temporal resolution and uneven spatial distribution have introduced significant uncertainties in regional assessments. To address these limitations, long-term reanalysis wind speed datasets have been developed, though their accuracy still needs further evaluation. In this paper, wind speed data from weather stations and from the ERA5-Land reanalysis product in the wind erosion region of northern China were collected to develop a predictive model for cumulative wind speed hours above the 5 m/s threshold, based on the XGBoost method combined with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis. The results showed that, compared to the cumulative wind speed hours derived from the ERA5-Land product, the model predictions more closely aligned with corresponding weather station measurements. Across different months, the explained variance for cumulative wind speed hours in the test set increased from an initial range of 10–53 % to 60–75 %, accompanied by reductions in mean absolute error (MAE) by 0.15–0.67 h and root mean square error (RMSE) by 1.11–2.14 h. The model also performed well in both cross-time and cross-location applications, explaining 72 % of the variation in cumulative wind speed hours in the validation set. This outperformed the ERA5-Land product, which accounted for only 59 % of the variation, and significantly reduced the associated prediction errors. The constructed XGBoost model was further used to simulate the cumulative wind speed hours in the study region in 2020. Its spatial simulation accuracy was comparable to that of the ordinary kriging method, with superior performance in capturing spatial variation in areas with sparse weather station coverage. The results provide reliable data on the cumulative wind speed duration required for large-scale soil wind erosion prediction and related environmental research."

 Autumn in Korea, following the peak rainy season in summer, is of a great importance as it coincides with the intensive harvesting of crops and fruits. Hence, autumn rainfall critically affects agricultural production in Korea. This study shows the emergence of new rainfall peaks in autumn, leading to potentially significant agricultural damages. In the monthly period from September 10 to October 10, the total rainfall in the recent period (150 mm for 1998–2023) has increased by 44 mm compared to the previous period (106 mm for 1979–1997), averaged over 61 stations. Heavy rainfall days (≥ 100 mm day−1) have also occurred more frequently. The most plausible mechanism for these changes is the delayed retreat of the western North Pacific subtropical high in autumn which results in westward shift of tropical cyclone (TC) tracks and increased number of days on which Korea is affected by TCs. In addition, rising sea surface temperatures (0.5–1.0°C) in the western North Pacific and the South China Sea appear to be related to increased TC-induced heavy rainfall in Korea. Enhanced low-level moisture transports from these warm oceanic areas toward Korea, combined with upper-level wind divergence, are likely to have intensified the conditions for the TC-induced heavy rainfall.

How winner cells induce the elimination of losers is poorly understood. We tackle this question by studying the onset of embryonic differentiation in mice, where cell competition eliminates 35% of embryonic cells. These loser cells have mitochondrial dysfunction, which we show causes amino acid deprivation and activation of the integrated stress response (ISR), a pathway essential for their survival. We demonstrate thatl-proline is a key amino acid sensed by the ISR and that proline represses the ISR and drives their elimination. These results indicate that cell competition acts as a previously unidentified tissue-sparing mechanism, regulated by the availability of extracellular amino acids, that allows for the elimination of dysfunctional cells when amino acids are plentiful but ensures their survival in nutrient-poor environments."

However, animals also learn to predict cues with no intrinsic value or biological relevance to ongoing behavior, and it is unclear whether such latent learning also relies on dopaminergic prediction errors. Here, we tested this by recording dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens and dorsomedial striatum while rats executed a sensory preconditioning task that incorporated both types of learning. We found that dopamine release in both regions correlated with errors in predicting value-neutral cues during latent learning and with errors in predicting reward during reward-based conditioning. Moreover, dopamine in the nucleus accumbens reflected inferred value in the probe test, supported by orbitofrontal cortex activity. Our findings show that dopamine signals prediction errors about both valued and neutral stimuli, consistent with its operation as a general teaching signal that supports learning across different informational domains."

Using textured Zn as a model system, we investigate Zn electrocrystallization and demonstrate correlated growth of crystalline films with correlation lengths from tens to hundreds of micrometers. At 5 milliamperes per square centimeter (mA/cm2), capacities between 20 and 82 milliampere hours per square centimeter (mA·hour/cm2) are achieved depending on substrate texture level.

Modulating CAFs in distant metastasis is challenging due to their diverse phenotypes and the lack of effective delivery strategies. Inspired by the tropism of tumor extracellular vesicles (Evs) expressing specific integrins toward fibroblasts, we developed a labeling strategy for both tumors and tumor-derived Evs. Our modified nanoliposomes, by hitchhiking on these labeled Evs, concentrated in CAFs at distant metastatic sites while simultaneously targeting the labeled tumor. This Ev-hitchhiking strategy, in combination with the loaded drugs ATRA and lenvatinib, efficiently regulated the myogenic and inflammatory characteristics of CAFs, remodeled the metastatic microenvironment, and suppressed tumor growth and metastasis.

Using a structural-asymmetric semiconductor metasurface incorporating [110] InGaP nanoresonators, we realize continuous tuning of polarization entanglement from partially entangled states to a Bell state by adjusting the pump wavelength. We also observe pronounced spatial anti-correlations and theoretically confirm that this approach can extend to tailor hyperentanglement. Furthermore, our nanoscale entanglement source features an ultrahigh coincidence-to-accidental ratio of ≈7 × 104, outperforming existing semiconductor flat optics by two orders of magnitude.

Despite their critical role, the biological differences between single CTCs and CTC clusters remain unclear. Here, we comprehensively compared their behavioral, transcriptomic, and proteomic profiles in lung cancer models. Compared with single cells, CTC clusters present enhanced metastatic potential, greater survival in the bloodstream and increased resistance to microenvironment. Mechanistically, the Src/FN1 pathway is centrally activated in clusters, promoting intercellular cohesion and protecting against immune clearance and stress in circulation. Pharmacological inhibition of Src with the clinical inhibitor KX2-391 disrupted clustering, impaired CTC survival, and reduced metastasis in preclinical models. Our findings identify the Src/FN1 pathway as a key vulnerability in CTC cluster–driven metastasis, suggesting that Src inhibitors are promising therapeutic strategies to disrupt clustering and improve outcomes in patients with metastatic lung cancer."

Unexpectedly, neither deletion of the NLRP3-activated pyroptotic effector GSDMD nor combined deletion of the inflammasome-activated cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 conferred strong protection from sHLH. Instead, co-deletion of GSDMD and caspase-8–activated GSDME limited sHLH-driven lethality, demonstrating redundancy in the pyroptotic machinery required to induce sHLH. We also found that bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) inhibitors prevent NLRP3-driven pyroptosis, which acted by blocking inflammasome priming. BET inhibitors prevented increased NLRP3 levels in diseased tissue, limited the production of sHLH-associated IL-1β, interferon-γ, and tumor necrosis factor, and protected from sHLH pathogenesis. These findings suggest that targeting NLRP3 could limit sHLH and identify clinically relevant bromodomain-selective BET inhibitors capable of eliminating NLRP3-driven pyroptosis and the sHLH cytokine storm."

Understanding the local adaptations and their vulnerabilities to climate change are imperative for developing conservation measures. Here, we combined a multidisciplinary approach to determine the local adaptations of an endemic and near-threatened primate, aiming to reveal its potential to cope with future climate change. Results suggest that climatic fluctuations played an important role in shaping its demographic trajectory and genetic structure. In addition, Tibetan macaques have experienced a severe bottleneck in the recent past, with highly deleterious mutations partially removed, but moderately deleterious mutations accumulating. The severe bottleneck and lower genetic diversity may have reduced their potential to adapt to environmental change, which will compromise long-term viability. Furthermore, we found that the eastern group exhibited higher genomic offsets and loss of suitable habitat in response to climate change. Overall, we emphasize the importance of integrating population genomics and environmental data to predict the adaptation of post-bottleneck populations to rapid climate change."

However, the current approaches to structured sound often have restrictions on the multiplexing capacity of generating sound vortices and lack of dynamic manipulation over them. Here, we unveil an approach to generating structured acoustic waves and achieving remote dynamic control based on the proposed concept of topological-charge (TC) multiplexed metasurface (TCMM). We demonstrate that the TCMM can serve as an efficient device to yield structured sound field with multiple spatial vortex singularities, whose features and physics are entirely determined by the TCs encoded in it. These degrees of freedom can be tuned independently, enabling the dynamic remote control of multiple acoustic vortices and leading to the precise control over their motion. Our findings provide different insights into the generation and control over sound vortices and establish a powerful platform for engineering structured acoustic waves."

Adult muscle cells are large and chain thousands of sarcomeres into long periodic myofibrils that attach to the skeleton. During development, muscle cells must increase in length to maintain the mechanical connection to the growing skeleton. How muscles add new sarcomeres to facilitate muscle growth is unknown. Using live imaging and high-throughput image analysis, we have now tracked the sarcomere components during the developmental growth ofDrosophilamuscle and found that individual sarcomeres divide along the myofibril tension axis into daughter sarcomeres. This way, new sarcomeres can be inserted into contractile and mechanically intact myofibrils. We propose that sarcomere division is triggered by tension and local sarcomere damage originating from skeletal growth and muscle contractions. Sarcomere divisions repair damaged sarcomeres, ensure their mechanical integrity, and synchronize sarcomere addition with skeletal growth during animal development."

The penetration capacity is demonstrated by an unprecedented depth (~150 micrometers) of bovine serum albumin (66.4 kilodaltons) across aortic vessels under pressing for only 60 seconds. This spongy coating-based PMI technique can be integrated with medical balloon devices, offering endoluminal treatment within blood vessels, tracheas, and intestines.

Wearables were given to 103 children for 21 days immediately after appendectomy, and biorhythm metrics were extracted from per-minute data. A machine-learned model using these metrics retrospectively predicted postoperative complications up to 3 days before formal diagnosis with 91% sensitivity and 74% specificity.

 The widespread utilization of low-sulfur fuels in compliance with global sulfur limit regulations has significantly mitigated the emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and particulate matter (PM) on ships. However, significant uncertainties still persist regarding the impact on intermediate-volatility/semi-volatile organic compounds (I/SVOCs). Therefore, onboard tests of I/SVOCs from three ocean-going vessels (OGVs) and four inland cargo ships (ICSs) with low-sulfur fuels (<0.50 % m/m) in China were carried out in this study. Results showed that the emission factors of total I/SVOCs were 881 ± 487, 1181 ± 421, and 1834 ± 667 mg per kg fuel for OGVs with heavy fuel oil (HFO), marine gas oil (MGO), and ICSs with no. 0 diesel, respectively. The transition from low-sulfur-content (<0.50 % m/m) to ultra-low-sulfur-content (<0.10 % m/m) fuels had evidently enhanced the emission factor of I/SVOCs, with unignorable contributions from particle-phase I/SVOCs, thereby further amplifying the secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOAFP). Fuel type, engine type, and operating conditions comprehensively influenced the emission factor level, compositions, and volatility distribution of I/SVOCs. Notably, a substantial proportion of fatty acids had been identified in ship exhausts, necessitating heightened attention. Furthermore, organic diagnostic markers of hopanes, in conjunction with the C18:0-to-C14:0 acid ratio, could be considered potential markers for HFO exhausts.

 Mercury emissions from human activities persist in the environment, posing risks to humans and ecosystem, and are regulated by the Minamata Convention. Understanding historical mercury emissions is critical for explaining their presence in the environment, and a long-term gridded emission inventory is essential for simulation and evaluation. While previous studies have improved the spatial resolution of emission inventories for recent years, few have combined long timescales with high spatial resolutions. Here, we compile a new comprehensive point source database by fusing multiple data sources and integrate it with the previous China Atmospheric Mercury Emission model to develop a long-term gridded emission inventory for China, covering 1978–2021, named P-CAME. By integrating point sources, P-CAME improves the accuracy of gridded emissions, reducing the normalized mean error by 108 % compared to an inventory without point sources for the most recent year of 2021. P-CAME highlights potential pollution hotspots, revealing that 20 % of cumulative emissions originate from just 0.3 % of the grids, primarily in the provinces of Gansu, Yunnan, and Hunan. These areas are dominated by non-ferrous metal smelting or mixed emissions from coal-fired industries and cement production. P-CAME also demonstrates consistency with observed Hg0 (gaseous elemental mercury) concentration trends over the past decade and shows potential to enhance the simulation of atmospheric mercury concentrations in urban areas, though its capacity is still limited by overall model performance. With improvements in terms of spatial distribution accuracy and reliable long-term trends, this updated inventory will provide valuable data support for global emissions modeling, facilitate assessments of mercury cycling and legacy impacts, and aid in the evaluation of the Minamata Convention.

Young leaves play a key role in this process, but their efficiency has been difficult to measure at large scales. Using satellite data, we developed a new method to track the seasonal patterns of young leaves’ photosynthetic capacity from 2001 to 2018. Our dataset helps scientists better understand forest growth and how ecosystems respond to climate change. 
 Determining the large-scale RuBisCO carboxylation maximum rate (Vc,max25) in relation to leaf age is essential for evaluating the photosynthetic capacity of canopy leaves in global forests. Young leaves (≤ 180 d), which exhibit higher Vc,max25 compared to old leaves (> 180 d), are key to controlling the seasonality of leaf photosynthetic capacity in tropical and subtropical evergreen broadleaved forests (TEFs). Nevertheless, quantifying the leaf photosynthetic capacities of different ages across TEFs remains challenging, especially when considering continuous temporal variations at continental scales. In this study, we propose a novel methodology that leverages neighborhood pixel analysis with nonlinear least-squares optimization to derive the Vc,max25 of young leaves at 0.25° spatial resolution. This approach utilizes satellite-based solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) products spanning the period from 2001 to 2018, which were reconstructed using both TROPOMI (Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument) SIF and MODIS reflectance data (RTSIF). Validations against in situ observations demonstrate that the newly developed Vc,max25 products accurately capture the seasonality of young leaves in South America and subtropical Asia, with correlation coefficients of 0.84, 0.66, and 0.95, respectively. The Vc,max25 of the young leaves simulated from the RTSIF-derived gross primary production (GPP) is effectively correlated (R > 0.51) with that dissolved from the global Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2)-based SIF (GOSIF) GPP. Furthermore, the gridded Vc,max25 dataset for young leaves successfully detects the green-up regions during the dry seasons in the tropics. Overall, this study presents the first satellite-based Vc,max25 dataset specifically targeting photosynthetically efficient young leaves, providing valuable insights for modeling large-scale photosynthetic dynamics and carbon cycles in TEFs.

This study introduces an efficient method to identify BHE, 13 times quicker, firstly enables the creation of BHE dataset in the North Pacific from 1993 to 2023. We verified BHE maintains strong coherence and contributes to westward transport about 1.5 Sv. We found some previously unidentified coherent eddies and analyzed their coherence. This represents first comprehensive analysis of BHE. 
 The methodologies employed for the identification of ocean coherent eddies can be categorized as either Eulerian and Lagrangian. Among Lagrangian structures, Black Hole Eddies (BHEs) exhibit the highest degree of material coherence and conservation, making them particularly suitable for studying the transport and retention of oceanic materials. This study presents an efficient Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) -based BHE identification algorithm, enhancing computational efficiency by approximately 13 times compared to the existing methods. Using this algorithm, the North Pacific Black Hole Eddy dataset (BHE v1.0) is constructed for the first time, based on satellite-derived surface geostrophic velocity data from January 1, 1993 to May 5, 2023 (Tian et al., https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15597447, 2025a). BHE v1.0 contains 18387 eddies with radius larger than 20 km and lifetimes longer than 4 weeks and captures both the spatial-temporal characteristics and the trajectories of coherent eddies throughout lifetimes. Through the advection of Lagrangian particles in Eulerian eddy, rotationally coherent Lagrangian vortices (RCLVs) and BHEs, it is confirmed that BHEs maintain strong material coherence and are able to maintain concentration during their life cycle, preserving their structure without significant filamentation or mixing with surrounding waters. Additionally, approximately 6 % of BHEs, which do not overlap with any RCLVs or Eulerian eddies, are identified and referred to as the Naked Black Hole Eddy and further analyze its coherence through advection. And Transport analysis shows that BHEs induce westward transport about 1.5 Sv, three times weaker than RCLVs, suggesting that they may offer a more accurate estimate of oceanic transport than RCLVs. These finding addresses the existing gap in Black Hole Eddy datasets within the field of oceanography and provides a novel perspective for studying the interactions between coherent eddies and oceanic physical phenomena."

The modern pollen dataset has good predictive power in estimating net primary production and annual precipitation. 
 A dataset of pollen extracted from the surface-sediments of lakes with an even spatial distribution is essential for pollen-based reconstructions of past vegetation and climate. We collected 90 lake surface-sediment samples from the Tibetan Plateau (TP) covering major vegetation types. A comprehensive modern pollen dataset is established by integrating our newly obtained modern pollen dataset with previous modern lacustrine pollen datasets, covering the full range of climatic gradients across the TP with mean annual precipitation (Pann) from 97 to 788 mm, mean annual temperature (Tann) -9.09 to 6.93 °C, mean temperature of the coldest month (Mtco) -23.48 to -2.65 °C, and mean temperature of the warmest month (Mtwa) 1.77 to 19.26 °C. Numerical analyses revealed that Pann is the primary climatic determinant for pollen distribution, while net primary production (NPP) is a valuable variable reflecting vegetation conditions. To detect the quantitative relationship between pollen and Pann/NPP, both weighted-averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS) and random forest algorithm (RF) were employed. The performance of both models suggests that this modern pollen dataset has good predictive power in estimating past NPP and Pann, but RF has a slight advantage with this dataset. This comprehensive modern pollen dataset is considered reliable when reconstructing vegetation and climate from pollen spectra from the central TP, but caution is needed if it is applied to pollen spectra from the marginal regions of the TP and those covering the Last Glacial period, due to poor analogue quality in those cases.

In this study, we established CFC-11 emission inventory from coal combustion in China during 2000~2021. We found that CFC-11 emissions from coal combustion exhibited fluctuations and an overall upward trend, peaking in 2016, and Hebei and Shandong provinces had higher emissions. The CFC-11 emissions from coal combustion in the coastal regions might influence the monitored CFC-11 concentrations. 
 The trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) emission from its production and use (PAU) has drawn wide attention, while its combustion sources have been overlooked. This study identified CFC-11 emission factors (EFs) as 3.6, 3.2, and 0.025 mg kg⁻1 from the combustion of domestic chunk coal, honeycomb briquette, and coal-fired power plant, respectively. A multi-year (2000~2021) emission inventory of CFC-11 from coal combustion was established in China. Results indicated that its annual emission averaged 233.5 t yr⁻1. It exhibited fluctuations and held an overall upward trend, increasing from accounting for 0.8 % of PAU emissions in 2000 to 9.8 % in 2021, with the peak value appearing in 2016. In Shandong and Hebei provinces with high coal consumption amounts, the CFC-11 emissions from coal combustion increased by approximately 74 % during 2014~2017 compared to 2011~2012. At the Gosan station close to Chinese mainland, CFC-11 emitted from coal combustion in Hebei and Shandong was approximately occupied by ~30 % of its average concentration during January 2016. An additional climate effect of the clean heating and coal-to-electricity policies in China was also observed, with an obvious decrease (2.2×106 t and 3.4×107 t) of CO2-equivalent emission. This study provides substantial evidence of CFC-11 emission from coal combustion and highlights the role of combustion emission under the background of reducing CFC-11 from PAU.

To investigate this, we applied a multiplex and cost-effective tandem mass tag-based quantitative proteomics to characterize peptide decay kinetics and reactions in three model viruses, namely, MS2, PhiX174, and T4, when they were treated with free chlorine. Strong correlations were observed between peptide decay rate constants and both solvent-accessible surface areas (SASAs) of methionine residues (Pearson's r = 0.78, p < 0.0001) and SASAs per residue in methionine-lacking peptides (Pearson's r = 0.81, p < 0.0001). A multiple linear regression model fitted using these two independent structural variables accurately predicted peptide decay rate constants in the three viruses (R2 = 0.91 for MS2 peptides, R2 = 0.72 for PhiX174 peptides, and R2 = 0.86 for T4 peptides). Notably, the peptide decay kinetics in viral proteins responsible for host attachment and genome injection better predicted virus resistance than that in other viral proteins.

Bis(2-ethylhexyl)-2,3,4,5-tetrabromophthalate (TBPH), a widely used novel brominated flame retardant, has raised concerns due to its widespread detection in human tissues. However, its role in chronic liver diseases remains poorly understood. In this study, we established both mouse and liver organoid (LO) models to investigate the impact of TBPH exposure on the progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and the underlying mechanisms. In a diet-induced NASH mouse model, TBPH exposure significantly enhanced hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Lipidomic analysis revealed that TBPH induced dysregulation of phospholipid metabolism, particularly reduced levels of cardiolipin (CL) and phosphatidylserine (PS). Mechanistically, TBPH decreased Mitofusin2 (MFN2) expression, leading to impaired endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria (ER-Mito) contacts, disrupted phospholipid transfer, and subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction. These alterations triggered both mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) and ER stress. Importantly, the activation of MFN2 with the agonist M1 in LOs alleviated TBPH-induced NASH phenotypes by restoring ER-Mito contacts and cellular bioenergetics. Our findings identify TBPH as an environmental risk factor for NASH progression, providing novel insights into the MFN2-mediated ER-Mito contacts in lipid metabolic homeostasis and new perspectives for the health risk evaluation of brominated flame retardants."

However, the impact of Fe–Mn complex minerals from a redox reaction of Fe(II) and birnessite on OC dynamics remains unexplored. Herein, the immobilization and molecular transformation of fulvic acid (FA), mediated by a redox reaction of Fe(II) and birnessite, were investigated at pH 4.0–8.0 with 1–5 mM Fe(II). Higher pH and Fe(II) addition promoted Fe(II) oxidation coupled with the reductive transformation of birnessite. The coupled adsorption–oxidation of FA occurred, and FA sequestration efficiency increased with a decrease in pH and increasing Fe(II) concentrations. Fe(II) oxidation primarily formed ferrihydrite, and a small portion of lepidocrocite and feitknechtite was detected under higher pH and Fe(II) addition conditions. In mineral–organo composites, Fe/Mn–O, Fe–C, edge- and corner-sharing Fe–Fe, and Mn–Mn bonds constituted the coordination environment. FA was associated with Fe–Mn complex minerals to improve its stability, while C in FA distributed within nanopores and thin coaggregates exhibited a higher oxidation state. Compounds with high molecular weight, O/C, and aromatic and unsaturated structures, predominantly composed of lignin, tannin, and condensed hydrocarbons, exhibited stronger binding to Fe–Mn complex minerals under lower pH and higher Fe(II) addition conditions. These findings provide a fundamental understanding of heterogeneous Fe–Mn complex mineral formation coupled with OM sequestration, which has significant implications for understanding the long-term cycling of Fe, Mn, and C in natural settings."

Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) has been a key component in aqueous film-forming foams, extensively used for firefighting in both military and civilian applications, including at oil refineries. During firefighting training, fuels have been historically used to ignite fires, and because of its use in foams, PFOS is often found alongside light nonaqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) petroleum hydrocarbons in subsurface soils and groundwater. The film-forming foams contain supersaturated PFOS, and upon contact with LNAPL and soil fluids, PFOS partitions between the phases. This phenomenon is challenging to investigate by using mesoscale approaches. Here, we use molecular-dynamics simulations to study the behavior of supersaturated PFOS, with a focus on micellization and partitioning at LNAPL–water interfaces. We demonstrate that large quantities of PFOS adsorb at LNAPL–water interfaces, suggesting that such interfaces may serve as major retention sites and long-term sources of PFOS contamination. Moreover, we show that both adsorption and micellization are considerably affected by the counterions used (sodium and hydronium). This may suggest a possible avenue for controlling the partitioning process through gaining a better understanding of the effect of water chemistry on PFOS."

Here, a controlled microcosm experiment was constructed to explore the interaction and microbial mechanism of warming (+4 °C) and nutrient enrichment (low, middle, and high nutrient gradients) to N2O emissions. We demonstrate that, compared to warming or eutrophication alone, their synergistic interaction amplified N2O flux by 100-fold and 3.5-fold, respectively. Nutrient loading exerts a dominant control over the regulation of N2O dynamics, surpassing that of warming. Mechanistically, eutrophication elevates substrate availability, while warming enhances microbial utilization thresholds, synergistically escalating N2O emissions. Microbial analyses reveal that nutrient enrichment increases (nirK + nirS)/nosZ and amoA abundance, whereas warming stimulates microbial enzyme activity. These dual stressors collaboratively reshape the microbial community structure, accelerating N2O metabolic rates. In addition, thermal stimulation enhances the gas diffusion coefficient and accelerates the release of N2O from the aqueous phase. Warming could cause the N2O emissions shift from a unimodal nonlinear pattern to linearity with elevated eutrophic level. Our findings establish a mechanistic framework linking climate-nutrient interactions to microbial N-cycling, providing critical insights for predicting and mitigating lacustrine N2O emissions in warming ecosystems.

Experiments and theoretical calculation results reveal that the electronic structure and coordination microenvironment of adjacent Ru nanoparticles could be regulated via electron transfer after Zn single-atom loading, forming greatly activated Ru sites with long-term stability.

The results showed that ∼23.89% of the drought‐induced GPP loss occurred after the drought, with a global mean of ∼0.74 Pg C yr−1. The higher proportions of post‐drought GPP loss were evident in humid regions, whereas the higher absolute post‐drought GPP loss mainly occurred in regions with higher vegetation cover. Furthermore, the global mean incidence and duration of post‐drought GPP loss were 50.66% ± 10.93% and 32.35 ± 10.56 days, respectively.

At about 110 km height within latitude of ±50°, the zonal winds are generally symmetrical about equatorial plane, while the meridional winds are antisymmetric. Dynamo currents produced by lunar tidal winds at 90–115 km height well reproduced the equivalent four‐vortex current system deduced from geomagnetic data. The lunar tidal wind pattern aligns with ionospheric currents, indicating its structure between 90 and 115 km significantly shapes lunar geomagnetic tide morphology.

It is commonly used to anticipate future impacts of climate change on streamflow and is assumed to be constant in time, despite evidence that this relationship varies with climatological and landscape changes. To assess the need for a more flexible definition, we present a large‐sample non‐stationary regional regression approach to estimate long‐term trends and variability in interannual streamflow elasticity to precipitation in the USA. We find that elasticity is highly variable in water‐limited catchments year‐to‐year, indicating high sensitivity to climate variability in arid regions. Statistically significant long‐term trends in elasticity exist in some regions, but trend magnitude is generally small. We demonstrate that a single average estimate of elasticity may be a poor indicator of streamflow sensitivity to climate change. Consideration of the variability of response is essential for elasticity to be a useful hydrologic signature."

 Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and magnitude of river floods1. Floods not only cause damage by inundation and loss of life2,3 but also jeopardize infrastructure because of bank failure and riverbed erosion processes that are poorly understood. Common flood safety programs include dike reinforcement and river widening4–9. The 2021 flood in the Meuse Basin caused 43 fatalities and a multibillion-dollar damage to infrastructure10. Based on analysis of the Meuse flood, we show how uneven widening of the river and heterogeneity of sediment deposits under the river can cause massive erosion. A recent flood safety program widened the river11, but created bottlenecks where widening was either prevented by infrastructure, or not yet implemented. Riverbed erosion was exacerbated by tectonic uplift that had produced a thin top gravel layer above fine-grained sediment. Greatly enhanced flow velocities produced underwater dunes with troughs that broke through the gravel armour in the bottlenecks, exposing easily erodible sands, resulting in extreme scour holes, one over 15 m deep. Our investigation highlights the challenges of re-engineering rivers in the face of climate change, increased flood risks, competition for river widening space, and calls for a better understanding of the subsurface."

 Advances in deep learning and AlphaFold2 have enabled the large-scale prediction of protein structures across species, opening avenues for studying protein function and evolution1. Here we analyse 11,269 predicted and experimentally determined enzyme structures that catalyse 361 metabolic reactions across 225 pathways to investigate metabolic evolution over 400 million years in the Saccharomycotina subphylum2. By linking sequence divergence in structurally conserved regions to a variety of metabolic properties of the enzymes, we reveal that metabolism shapes structural evolution across multiple scales, from species-wide metabolic specialization to network organization and the molecular properties of the enzymes. Although positively selected residues are distributed across various structural elements, enzyme evolution is constrained by reaction mechanisms, interactions with metal ions and inhibitors, metabolic flux variability and biosynthetic cost. Our findings uncover hierarchical patterns of structural evolution, in which structural context dictates amino acid substitution rates, with surface residues evolving most rapidly and small-molecule-binding sites evolving under selective constraints without cost optimization. By integrating structural biology with evolutionary genomics, we establish a model in which enzyme evolution is intrinsically governed by catalytic function and shaped by metabolic niche, network architecture, cost and molecular interactions.

 Cryptic genetic variants exert minimal phenotypic effects alone but are hypothesized to form a vast reservoir of genetic diversity driving trait evolvability through epistatic interactions1–3. This classical theory has been reinvigorated by pan-genomics, which is revealing pervasive variation within gene families, cis-regulatory regions and regulatory networks4–6. Testing the ability of cryptic variation to fuel phenotypic diversification has been hindered by intractable genetics, limited allelic diversity and inadequate phenotypic resolution. Here, guided by natural and engineered cis-regulatory cryptic variants in a paralogous gene pair, we identified additional redundant trans regulators, establishing a regulatory network controlling tomato inflorescence architecture. By combining coding mutations with cis-regulatory alleles in populations segregating for all four network genes, we generated 216 genotypes spanning a wide spectrum of inflorescence complexity and quantified branching in over 35,000 inflorescences. Analysis of this high-resolution genotype–phenotype map using a hierarchical model of epistasis revealed a layer of dose-dependent interactions within paralogue pairs enhancing branching, culminating in strong, synergistic effects. However, we also identified a layer of antagonism between paralogue pairs, whereby accumulating mutations in one pair progressively diminished the effects of mutations in the other. Our results demonstrate how gene regulatory network architecture and complex dosage effects from paralogue diversification converge to shape phenotypic space, producing the potential for both strongly buffered phenotypes and sudden bursts of phenotypic change.

 In the past decade, ancient protein sequences have emerged as a valuable source of data for deep-time phylogenetic inference1–4. Still, even though ancient proteins have been reported from the Middle–Late Miocene5,6, the recovery of protein sequences providing subordinal-level phylogenetic insights does not exceed 3.7 million years ago (Pliocene)1. Here, we push this boundary back to 21–24 million years ago (Early Miocene) by retrieving enamel protein sequences of a rhinocerotid (Epiaceratherium sp.; CMNFV59632) from Canada’s High Arctic. We recover partial sequences of seven enamel proteins and more than 1,000 peptide–spectrum matches, spanning at least 251 amino acids. Endogeneity is in line with thermal age estimates and is supported by indicators of protein damage, including several spontaneous and irreversible chemical modifications accumulated during prolonged diagenesis. Bayesian tip-dating places the divergence time of CMNFV59632 in the Middle Eocene–Oligocene, coinciding with a phase of high rhinocerotid diversification7. This analysis identifies a later Oligocene divergence for Elasmotheriinae, weakening alternative models suggesting a deep basal split between Elasmotheriinae and Rhinocerotinae8,9. The findings are consistent with hypotheses on the origin of the enigmatic fauna of the Haughton Crater, which, in spite of considerable endemism, has similarity to distant Eurasian faunas10,11.

Our work maps the chemical landscape of plastics and contributes to setting the baseline for a transition towards safer and more sustainable materials and products.

 Spontaneous two-photon emission (STPE) is a second-order quantum radiation process with implications in astrophysics1, atomic physics2 and quantum technology3. In particular, on-demand STPE from single quantum emitters has long been predicted to revolutionize photonic quantum science and technology4,5. Here we report STPE with brightness comparable to that of competing single-photon radiation from a single semiconductor quantum dot deterministically coupled to a high-quality micropillar cavity. This is because of strong vacuum fluctuations in the microcavity, which drive a biexciton directly to the ground state. We show the quantum nature associated with STPE in the cavity quantum electrodynamics regime using photon statistics measurements. Furthermore, STPE is exploited to build unconventional entangled quantum light sources that can simultaneously achieve near-unity entanglement fidelity for spontaneous parametric down-conversion sources and on-demand photon emission for atomic quantum emitters. Our work provides insights into the two-photon process in the quantum regime, which could empower photonic quantum technology with nonlinear quantum radiation. Quantum correlations of spontaneous two-photon emission emitted from a bright quantum dot device are revealed, facilitating the creation of entangled photons with near-unity fidelity."

 When two monolayer materials are stacked with a relative twist, an effective moiré translation symmetry emerges, leading to fundamentally different properties in the resulting heterostructure. As such, moiré materials have recently provided highly tunable platforms for exploring strongly correlated systems1,2. However, previous studies have focused almost exclusively on monolayers with triangular lattices and low-energy states near the Γ (refs. 3,4) or K (refs. 5–9) points of the Brillouin zone (BZ). Here we introduce a new class of moiré systems based on monolayers with triangular lattices but low-energy states at the M points of the BZ. These M-point moiré materials feature three time-reversal-preserving valleys related by threefold rotational symmetry. We propose twisted bilayers of exfoliable 1T-SnSe2 and 1T-ZrS2 as realizations of this new class. Using extensive ab initio simulations, we identify twist angles that yield flat conduction bands, provide accurate continuum models, analyse their topology and charge density and explore the platform’s rich physics. Notably, the M-point moiré Hamiltonians exhibit emergent momentum-space non-symmorphic symmetries and a kagome plane-wave lattice structure. This represents, to our knowledge, the first experimentally viable realization of projective representations of crystalline space groups in a non-magnetic system. With interactions, these systems act as six-flavour Hubbard simulators with Mott physics. Moreover, the presence of a momentum-space non-symmorphic in-plane mirror symmetry renders some of the M-point moiré Hamiltonians quasi-one-dimensional in each valley, suggesting the possibility of realizing Luttinger-liquid physics. A new class of moiré materials based on monolayers with triangular lattices and low-energy states at the M points of the Brillouin zone is introduced, demonstrating emergent momentum-space non-symmorphic symmetries, a kagome plane-wave lattice structure, and potential quasi-one-dimensionality."

 Deuterated acids/bases are high-value bulk chemicals used for synthesizing deuterated pharmaceuticals1,2, modifying optoelectronic materials3 and mediating hydrogen isotope exchange reactions4,5. However, conventional synthesis methods require harsh reaction conditions with high energy consumption6,7. Here we propose a versatile platform that takes advantage of heavy water dissociation in bipolar membranes (BPMs) to produce deuterated acids and bases under particularly mild conditions. Specifically, D2SO4 (2.75 mol l−1) and KOD (5.82 mol l−1), which are comparable with commercial products, were prepared using inexpensive D2O and K2SO4. We find that the deuteron generation rate is approximately 1.25 times greater than that of the protons, which is attributed to less co-ion leakage of D+ than H+ through the anion-exchange membrane (AEM), lower salt leakage within BPMs in D2O than in H2O and lower dehydration barrier of deuterons than proton clusters in the membrane phase. Compared with other contributing factors, salt leakage plays a relatively minor role in the observed H+/D+ concentration difference. This flexible and robust platform facilitates the synthesis of various deuterium-labelled compounds.

 Plastic pollution of the marine realm is widespread, with most scientific attention given to macroplastics and microplastics1,2. By contrast, ocean nanoplastics (<1 μm) remain largely unquantified, leaving gaps in our understanding of the mass budget of this plastic size class3–5. Here we measure nanoplastic concentrations on an ocean-basin scale along a transect crossing the North Atlantic from the subtropical gyre to the northern European shelf. We find approximately 1.5–32.0 mg m−3 of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) nanoplastics throughout the entire water column. On average, we observe a 1.4-fold higher concentration of nanoplastics in the mixed layer when compared with intermediate water depth, with highest mixed-layer nanoplastic concentrations near the European continent. Nanoplastic concentrations at intermediate water depth are 1.8-fold higher in the subtropical gyre compared with the open North Atlantic outside the gyre. The lowest nanoplastic concentrations, with about 5.5 mg m−3 on average and predominantly composed of PET, are present in bottom waters. For the mixed layer of the temperate to subtropical North Atlantic, we estimate that the mass of nanoplastic may amount to 27 million tonnes (Mt). This is in the same range or exceeding previous budget estimates of macroplastics/microplastics for the entire Atlantic6,7 or the global ocean1,8.

 Decreased brain levels of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), an endogenously synthesized lipophilic antioxidant1,2, underpin encephalopathy in primary CoQ10 deficiencies3,4 and are associated with common neurodegenerative diseases and the ageing process5,6. CoQ10 supplementation does not increase CoQ10 pools in the brain or in other tissues. The recent discovery of the mammalian CoQ10 headgroup synthesis pathway, in which 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase-like protein (HPDL) makes 4-hydroxymandelate (4-HMA) to synthesize the CoQ10 headgroup precursor 4-hydroxybenzoate (4-HB)7, offers an opportunity to pharmacologically restore CoQ10 synthesis and mechanistically treat CoQ10 deficiencies. To test whether 4-HMA or 4-HB supplementation promotes CoQ10 headgroup synthesis in vivo, here we administered 4-HMA and 4-HB to Hpdl−/− mice, which model an ultra-rare, lethal mitochondrial encephalopathy in humans. Both 4-HMA and 4-HB were incorporated into CoQ9 and CoQ10 in the brains of Hpdl−/− mice. Oral treatment of Hpdl−/− pups with 4-HMA or 4-HB enabled 90–100% of Hpdl−/− mice to live to adulthood. Furthermore, 4-HB treatment stabilized and improved the neurological symptoms of a patient with progressive spasticity due to biallelic HPDL variants. Our work shows that 4-HMA and 4-HB can modify the course of mitochondrial encephalopathy driven by HPDL variants and demonstrates that CoQ10 headgroup intermediates can restore CoQ10 synthesis in vivo.

 Optically active spin defects in solids1,2 are leading candidates for quantum sensing3,4 and quantum networking5,6. Recently, single spin defects were discovered in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)7–11, a layered van der Waals (vdW) material. Owing to its two-dimensional structure, hBN allows spin defects to be positioned closer to target samples than in three-dimensional crystals, making it ideal for atomic-scale quantum sensing12, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of single molecules. However, the chemical structures of these defects7–11 remain unknown and detecting a single nuclear spin with a hBN spin defect has been elusive. Here we report the creation of single spin defects in hBN using 13C ion implantation and the identification of three distinct defect types based on hyperfine interactions. We observed both S = 1/2 and S = 1 spin states within a single hBN spin defect. We demonstrated atomic-scale NMR and coherent control of individual nuclear spins in a vdW material, with a π-gate fidelity up to 99.75% at room temperature. By comparing experimental results with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we propose chemical structures for these spin defects. Our work advances the understanding of single spin defects in hBN and provides a pathway to enhance quantum sensing using hBN spin defects with nuclear spins as quantum memories.

 The carpus (wrist) of birds has a complex evolutionary history, long known to involve carpal reduction and recently shown to include topological replacement of one carpal (the ulnare) by another (the pisiform)1. The pisiform plays a crucial role in stabilization of the distal wingtip during flight2, and facilitates kinematic integration that ‘automates’ wing motion3. The apparent absence of a pisiform in all but the earliest theropod dinosaurs led to the proposal that it was lost early in theropod evolution and regained only in birds as a key step in the origin of flight1. Here, we describe the forelimb skeletons of two newly prepared theropod dinosaur specimens from the Gobi Desert of Mongolia, each of which preserves a pisiform, establishing its presence in Oviraptorosauria and Troodontidae in addition to birds. Reinterpretation of published material in light of these specimens shows a pisiform in a wide range of theropod species, including Microraptor4, Ambopteryx5 and Anchiornis6. Our results indicate that the pisiform replaced the ulnare by origin of the clade Pennaraptora, phylogenetically coincident with the hypothesized origin(s) of flight in birds and their closest relatives7,8. Taken together, our results indicate that replacement of the ulnare by the pisiform was a terminal step in assembly of the dinosaurian flight apparatus that occurred close to the origins of flight in theropod dinosaurs, rather than a novelty restricted to birds.

 The Southwest United States is experiencing severe and persistent drought, although uncertainties regarding the causes limit our ability to predict changes in water availability. The severity of the current drought has been attributed to a combination of warming and natural changes in atmospheric circulation, suggesting that current rainfall deficits may improve as natural oscillations reverse sign. Here we use new leaf-wax stable isotope reconstructions and simulations for the mid-Holocene (6 thousand years ago) and demonstrate that moderate warming of the Northern Hemisphere can produce drought over the Southwest United States through an ocean–atmosphere response originating in the North Pacific. The patterns of ocean warming and rainfall change resemble the negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, indicating that this mode can be excited by external forcings. A similar response to warming is evident in future projections, leading to sustained winter precipitation deficits through the mid-twenty-first century. However, the magnitudes of past and current precipitation deficits associated with this North Pacific response are systematically underestimated in models, possibly due to a weak coupling of ocean–atmosphere interactions. Projections may also underestimate the magnitude of this precipitation response to changes in the North Pacific, leading to greater drought risk in this already water-poor region.

Here the authors reveal a non-monotonic size dependence of exciton radiative lifetime, suggesting optimal sizes for applications requiring fast photoemission. 
 Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals have attracted intense interest due to their desirable optical properties, diverse structural features, and size-tunable excitonic structure. Here we show that, under ambient conditions, a non-monotonic trend in radiative lifetime emerges from the interplay of size, lattice symmetry and excitonic structure. Small nanocrystals exhibit long radiative lifetimes due to weakly emissive excitons, but the oscillator strength increases and shortens the lifetime for nanocrystals approaching intermediate confinement. For larger nanocrystals with higher exciton density of states (DOS), the radiative lifetime is lengthened due to depopulation of the bright exciton manifold into thermally accessible dim states. A size-dependent structural symmetry lowering transition from cubic to orthorhombic is observed by XRD and MD simulations, and the non-monotonic radiative lifetime trend emerges only in lower symmetry structures with an increased dim exciton DOS. These findings shed light on the impact of nanocrystal size and structure on radiative lifetime and pave the way for tailored optical materials in various optical applications.

 Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) facilitates the study of transcriptome diversity in individual cells. Yet, many existing methods lack sensitivity and accuracy. Here we introduce SCALPEL, a Nextflow-based tool to quantify and characterize transcript isoforms from standard 3’ scRNA-seq data. Using synthetic data, SCALPEL demonstrates higher sensitivity and specificity compared to other tools. In real datasets, SCALPEL predictions have a high agreement with other tools and can be experimentally validated. The use of SCALPEL on real datasets reveals novel cell populations undetectable using single-cell gene expression data, confirms known 3’ UTR length changes during cell differentiation, and identifies cell-type specific miRNA signatures regulating isoform expression. Additionally, we show that SCALPEL improves isoform quantification using paired long- and short-read scRNA-seq data. Overall, SCALPEL expands the current scRNA-seq toolkit to explore post-transcriptional gene regulation across species, tissues, and technologies, advancing our understanding of gene regulatory mechanisms at the single-cell level.

 With their long lifetime and protection against decoherence, dark excitons in monolayer semiconductors offer a promising route for quantum technologies. Optical techniques have previously observed dark excitons with a long-lived valley polarization. However, several aspects remain unknown, such as the populations and time evolution of the different valley-polarized dark excitons and the role of excitation conditions. Here, using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we obtain a holistic view of the dynamics after valley-selective photoexcitation. By varying experimental conditions, we reconcile between the rapid valley depolarization previously reported in TR-ARPES, and the observation of long-lived valley polarized dark excitons in optical studies. For the latter, we find that momentum-dark excitons largely dominate at early times sustaining a 40% degree of valley polarization, while valley-polarized spin-dark states dominate at longer times. Our measurements provide the timescales and how the different dark excitons contribute to the previously observed long-lived valley polarization in optics.

Here the authors show that Atlantic water inflow, and the subsequent subduction and circulation, is reducing dissolved oxygen in the Arctic due to reduced solubility with increased temperatures. 
 Overall ocean health depends critically on dissolved oxygen, which is increasingly impacted by global warming. The Arctic and subarctic regions are experiencing exceptionally rapid warming, known as Arctic amplification, yet its impact on oceanic oxygen remains poorly understood. Here we show that inflowing Atlantic Water (AW) drives deoxygenation in the upper eastern Arctic Ocean and the intermediate layers of the western Arctic Ocean at rates from −0.41 ± 0.17 to −0.47 ± 0.07 µmol kg−1 yr−1, six times the global mean. Amplified Arctic warming is the primary driver, significantly reducing oxygen solubility in the Arctic gateway regions. Rapid subduction and circulation of AW further transmit the deoxygenation signal into Arctic deeper layers, greatly threatening marine ecosystems. Our findings highlight the dominant role of warming Atlantic inflow in shaping the Arctic Ocean oxygen dynamics, indicating that ongoing temperature increases will perpetuate deoxygenation trends and underscoring the need for widespread attention.

 Perfluoroalkyl acids have been widely used during the last fifty years in a myriad of industrial and consumer applications, and are a paradigm of persistent “forever chemicals”. Earlier studies suggested a limited occurrence in the Southern Ocean as a consequence of the Antarctic circumpolar current preventing their oceanic transport southwards. Here we show perfluoroalkyl acids in the Bransfield Strait and Bellingshausen Sea (west of Antarctic Peninsula) at concentrations of comparable magnitude to those measured in the North Atlantic, a region impacted by historical sources. Atmospheric wet deposition of perfluoroalkyl acids previously aerosolized by sea-spray arises as the perfluoroalkyl acids source to Antarctica. The prevailing marine and atmospheric circulation in the region encapsulate these chemicals in the Antarctic region once these have crossed the Antarctic divergence. This work underscores the importance of persistence driving chemical’s environmental risk, and raises concern on the impact of the larger pool of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances.

 Cropland changes modulate local temperature by altering terrestrial biophysical properties, yet the global sign and magnitude of this impact remain uncertain due to fragmented distributions and complex natural land-cover conversions. Using satellite remote sensing (2000–2020), we quantify sub-pixel-level biophysical effects on land surface temperature from global cropland expansion into both forest and non-forest vegetation. Our results show that cropland expansion into non-forest vegetation (87% of global conversions) induces spatially heterogeneous temperature responses. Summer cropland conversions caused net global cooling (−0.002 ± 0.000 °C per five years), with 50% attributable to non-forest vegetation replacement. Boreal regions (40°N–50°N) exhibited pronounced cooling (−0.02 ± 0.001 °C per five years), while tropical zones (0°S–10°S) experienced localized warming (+0.07 ± 0.001 °C per five years). Winter cropland conversions contributed minimally to boreal temperature changes but amplified tropical warming (+0.07 ± 0.002 °C per five years; 10°S–20°S). Temperature sensitivity to cropland fraction varied asymmetrically with background land cover: Complete non-forest vegetation replacement in the Northern Hemisphere yielded stronger summer cooling (−0.06 °C) than warming from reversed conversions (+0.02 °C), whereas maximum forest replacement warming (+0.78 °C) exceeded its cooling benefits (−0.55 °C). These findings highlight the summer cooling capacity in boreal non-forest vegetation replacement and reveal the risk of tropical cropland expansion to climate mitigation. The global expansion of cropland onto non-forest vegetation during the summer over the period 2000–2020 caused a net global cooling of −0.002 °C every 5 years, mainly driven by boreal regions, but also led to localized warming in tropical areas, according to an analysis of satellite data."

 The application of Time-series Interferometry of Synthetic Aperture Radar (TS-InSAR) for monitoring small and narrow infrastructural elements can be limited when using medium spatial resolution SAR sensors, such as Sentinel-1, due to sparse coverage of coherent pixels. Therefore, carefully selecting coherent pixels is crucial to maximise the density of reliable measurement points and to minimise noisy observations. In this study, a novel framework is proposed for selecting coherent pixels within the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers Small Baseline (StaMPS-SB) approach based on the temporal coherence predicted by deep learning. Unlike previous complex deep learning approaches to this problem, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model is trained on time-domain and frequency-domain features extracted from a time series of SAR amplitude images to predict the temporal coherence value of each individual pixel, and thus to select coherent pixels. A long short-term memory (LSTM) model, trained directly on the same amplitude time series, is used as a benchmark for evaluating the MLP model’s performance. Predictions of temporal coherence from MLP and LSTM models are similar, but the MLP model training time is much faster. Compared to standard amplitude difference dispersion (ADD) analysis, the MLP model increases the number of coherent pixels over buildings, linear infrastructure, and non-urban classes by 40 %, 68 %, and 45 %, respectively. In addition, the MLP model approach produces fewer unreliable (non-coherent) pixels; over non-urban regions, 70 % to 80 % of pixels selected by the ADD analysis have low temporal coherence (<0.8), compared to only 10 % to 12 % selected by the MLP model."

The current study used EO data Sentinel-1 SAR to develop a classification approach for detection a traditional fish method using dry branches (called acadja), and water hyacinth (which mainly occurs in acadja) in Lake Nokoué (Benin). The employed method analyses the distribution of VV and VH polarisation values to determine the boundary (threshold interval) between acadjas and water hyacinth objects on one hand, and open water on the other. This analysis, referred to as a ’quartile-based threshold analysis’, was conducted from 2019 to 2023, taking seasonal variations into account. The study results show that VH polarisation is a more stable method for detecting acadjas and water hyacinths. The overall accuracy of object detection is 87%, with a confusion rate of less than 5% throughout the study period. A comparison of these results with those produced by the Otsu algorithm and the use of NDVI indicates that the latter underestimates the areas covered by acadjas and water hyacinths."

 Real-time monitoring of river surface velocity and flow extent is crucial for flood risk mitigation, sustainable water resources management, and ecosystem protection. However, high computational demands and limited high-resolution river cross-section data make real-time river monitoring impractical, particularly for large or ungauged rivers during emergencies, impeding rapid analysis and decision-making. A key limitation is the lack of an all-in-one, efficient tool combining machine learning-based segmentation with real-time optical flow estimation on edge-computing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).To address these challenges, we introduce RivAIr, a novel UAV-mounted sensor system designed for real-time river monitoring. This self-contained, edge-computing module integrates custom hardware with real-time machine learning and optical flow algorithms, enabling onboard water segmentation and river surface velocity estimation. Unlike existing methods that rely on post-processing, RivAIr is purpose-built for real-time field deployment in data-scarce or emergency scenarios.RivAIr integrates YOLOv8 with an optimized Farneback dense optical flow algorithm focused on water bodies, improving motion estimation accuracy while reducing runtime for real-time UAV processing. Validated along the Basento River (Basilicata, Italy) under controlled conditions, the optimal configuration of RivAIr achieved a 90% confidence score in water surface area detection and velocity estimation with a −3% error relative to in-situ measurements, showing strong consistency with in-situ flow observations. Notably, RivAIr completed end-to-end processing in approximately 40 s, demonstrating operational feasibility across altitudes and distances up to 800 m from the ground unit. RivAIr represents a significant advancement in real-time hydrological monitoring, essential for both routine and emergency applications."

 Monitoring crop phenology is crucial for improving agricultural management and supporting food security, especially in low- and middle-income (LMIC) countries like Egypt, where smallholder farms account for most food production. This study evaluates the potential of fused Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9 data, generated with the Sen2Like processor, for retrieving key phenological metrics at field-scale in a multi-cropping agricultural system of the Nile Delta. Forty-two fields were analysed over six years, focusing on wheat, maize, rice and clover in El Gharbia Governorate. Phenological metrics were derived using the Decomposition and Analysis of Time-Series Software (DATimeS) and were evaluated based on a reference crop calendar. Results showed that 91% of crop seasons were detected using the Sen2Like fused product compared to 88% using Sentinel-2 alone. For both datasets, the Start of Season (SOS) for summer crops presented a root mean squared error (RMSE) of about 35 days from the calendar date, while the SOS for winter crops had an RMSE of about 14 days. Due to its daily temporal coverage, PlanetScope data was used for additional evaluation. Metrics extracted with Sen2Like and PlanetScope presented a good agreement, with an RMSE of 1 day for metrics occurring during spring months and an RMSE of 6 days for winter metrics. Moreover, mapping key phenological stages provided insights into the crops’ spatial and temporal distribution across the study area. This study demonstrates the value of Sen2Like in capturing field-scale phenology with implications for improving agricultural practices and farm sustainability."

 ObjectiveThis study aims at exploring the associations between six major ambient air pollutants, including PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, and IS incidence in a Chinese megacity (Tianjin), and finding out susceptible populations, to provide insights for public IS prevention in areas facing relatively higher level of air pollution and heavier IS burden.MethodWe collected IS admissions data across 5 hospitals in Tianjin from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019. The daily mean concentrations of ambient air pollutants were used as exposure parameters. We applied a time-stratified case-crossover design combined with quasi-poisson regression to examine short term effects of air pollution on IS hospitalizations and performed subgroup analyses stratified by gender, age, and season.Results75132 IS cases were enrolled finally. We found that increases of 10 μg/m3 in PM2.5 and NO2 were associated with 0.26 %(95 % CI: 0.01 %–0.53 %) and 1.05 % (95 % CI: 0.34 %–1.76 %) increases in IS hospitalization at the same day (Lag0 day) respectively, but no lag effects were observed in the single-day lag structure. And the cumulative lag effects of PM2.5 and NO2 were only observed at lag01 day with the percentage increases of IS for 10 μg/m3 of their concentrations being 0.36 %(95 % CI: 0.04 %–0.68 %) and 1.21 %(95 % CI: 0.43 %–2.04 %). The effects were more pronounced in the male and younger populations for PM2.5 and NO2 in the warm season, and a positive association was also observed between PM10 and IS in the younger group. As for SO2, CO and O3, no statistically significant associations were found between them and IS.ConclusionOur findings suggested that short-term exposures to PM2.5, NO2, PM10 increase the risk of IS hospitalizations, especially in the male and younger populations. Reducing targeted pollution emission may have significant public health effects in reducing IS burden."

 This study uses ground hail reports in the United States and Global Precipitation Measurement Core Observatory data from 2014 to 2022 to analyze the spatiotemporal evolutions of precipitation microphysical parameters (mass-weighted mean diameter (Dm), and generalized intercept parameter (Nw)) and its relationship with convective parameters during the two hours around hail. The results indicate that at 3 km above ground level, the regions with large raindrops, high reflectivity (Ze), high storm height and strong updrafts moved from northwest to southeast, indicating a typical hailstorm movement pattern. Vertically, the variations of Ze and Dm correlate well with their spatiotemporal variability at the 3 km. Regardless of altitude, Dm and Ze exhibited higher values in the northwestern sector prior to hail report time, while higher values shifted to the southeastern sector post-hail. Notably, Nw showed minimal temporal differences below 5 km, whereas above 5 km pre-hail Nw values were lower compared to post-hail. This suggests that different microphysical processes of precipitation particles may occur across different time periods and regions. Convective precipitation in hailstorm was primarily influenced by the collision-coalescence process, while stratiform precipitation primarily involved both break-up and collision-coalescence processes. Meanwhile, the height of 20/40 dBZ echo top (HT20/40) revealed nonlinear relationship with microphysical parameters. For example, the Dm at 3 km increased with HT40 when HT40 is less than 6 km, but changed a little when HT40 is larger than 6 km. These findings provide new insights into the microphysical processes surrounding hailstorms and contribute to improving hail prediction models."

We found that ACBD5 and PTPIP51 form a contact between peroxisomes and mitochondria. The percentage of these contacts increased during mitochondrial oxidative stress and helped to maintain mitochondrial health through the transfer of mitochondrial ROS to the peroxisome lumen.

Results show that single-thread channels originate from a balance between lateral erosion and accretion, which enables a thread to migrate while maintaining equilibrium width.

Our findings reveal that CDHW events generally coincide with low-SM/high-VPD conditions, with most occurring during the well-documented droughts of 1983, 1997–1998, 2010, 2015–2016, and 2023–2024.

The concept of compound events has gained increasing attention in recent literature, offering opportunities to enhance disaster understanding, while also presenting challenges and open issues for modern risk assessment frameworks. This study investigates the capability of existing disasters/extreme events databases (Emergency Events Database EM-DAT, Severe Weather Data Inventory SWDI, and Canadian Disaster Database CDD) to capture compound event dynamics, and assess the accuracy of reported impacts. We found that SWDI, a national dataset for the USA, reports a high number of compound events versus single events, always higher than 50%, except for wildfires, and its structure allows for accurately identify spatially compounding events. This percentage in EM-DAT, a global dataset, is always lower than 50%, except for storms. A good match in events occurrences can be observed between the three databases, however the agreement in terms of deaths and injures varies depending on the databases compared. Finally, the work highlights the limitations of existing databases in representing the multidimensional nature of risks, and the cascading impacts that emerge from compound hazards. Reclassifying disasters from a compound event perspective not only enriches our knowledge of hazard dynamics, but also provides actionable pathways for improving risk assessment, informing adaptive policies, and enhancing resilience to the growing complexity of environmental challenges."

Norway’s strong EV supporting policies has led to an explosion of EVs and reduced direct emissions, but with rural-urban differences and undocumented upstream impacts. We investigated how the material composition and life cycle GHG emissions of Norwegian vehicles have evolved between 2000 and 2023 by integrating spatiotemporal vehicle data with a vehicle life cycle assessment model. The average life cycle GHG emissions per vehicle-km (vkm) of a newly registered car have significantly decreased (−49% since 2000) thanks to the decrease in use phase emissions (−89% since 2000). However, component-related emissions have increased (+81% since 2000) due to electrification and a trend towards large vehicles. Changes in the fleet are slow: EVs constituted 24% of the stock in 2023 and average life cycle GHG emissions per vkm have barely declined (−8% since 2000). EVs are concentrated in urban and peri-urban areas, while remote areas have few EVs, illustrating the unequal spatial distribution of electric mobility. Our study highlights the challenges related to EV penetration and emphasizes the need to expand to additional indicators beyond direct GHG emissions for a comprehensive understanding of EVs’ role in climate change mitigation."

This study explores how extreme weather conditions affect the persistence of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 in forest ecosystems. Using Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, we quantify persistence and assess changes in carbon flux stability under stress. By analysing high-frequency carbon flux data across multiple European sites, we reveal that ecosystem persistence is tightly linked to hydrological conditions, particularly soil moisture. Moreover, we show that large drops in persistence can signal periods of ecosystem stress. Our findings show that drought–heat compound events can diminish resilience and prolong recovery times, with temperate and boreal forests lacking heat or drought adaptations emerging as especially vulnerable. Furthermore, these stress pulses alter carbon dynamics long after the event, suggesting physiological damage that heightens sensitivity to future weather fluctuations. Overall, identifying changes in persistence could signal potential ecological destabilisation, providing key insights into how terrestrial ecosystems might cope with intensifying climate extremes."

Observed impacts include lower oxygen solubility and changes in ocean stratification, circulation and biological activity. To reduce the carbon burden in the atmosphere in the future and thereby mitigate anthropogenic climate change, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) techniques have been increasingly studied and tested. However, information on the impact of CDR on oceanic oxygen is still scarce. In the current study we explore dissolved oxygen responses from an idealized CDR implementation, with atmospheric CO2 ramp-up and ramp-down simulations following the CDR model intercomparison project protocol. We find that over the timescale of a few centuries, the degree of recovery of marine oxygen, after atmospheric CO2 has returned to pre-industrial levels, differs for different water depths. Oxygen concentrations strongly recover in the upper ocean, achieving a near reversibility within 97%–99% across models, and even overshoot pre-industrial levels at depths of 100–600 m. Conversely, oxygen responses show a long-lasting deoxygenation signal in the deep ocean, with a much smaller initial recovery signal by the end of the experiment. The main factor driving oxygen changes in the deep ocean is indicated by the apparent oxygen utilization, related to changes in circulation and ventilation, as inferred by the simulated age of deep water masses. According to our models and despite the effective recovery of oxygen in the upper ocean, the effects of time lags and hysteresis on deep ocean responses could lead to longstanding and deleterious impacts on redox-sensitive biogeochemical processes and on marine biota throughout the ocean."

However, CDR measures may unintentionally increase emissions of other climate forcers. If emissions of potent short-lived climate forcers (like methane) are increased, the CDR mechanism could potentially worsen climate change in the near-term despite benefiting the climate in the long-term. This temporal trade-off can be easily overlooked when employing the standard climate metric used for assessments— carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) using a 100 year global warming potential (GWP)—because it solely conveys the long-term warming impacts of a pulse of emissions. A more sophisticated assessment method is needed to reveal potential temporal trade-offs in climate benefits—important information for effective decision making. In this study, we compare three climate impact assessment approaches of increasing complexity to evaluate temporal trade-offs in climate benefits from CDR strategies: (1) the standard CO2e using GWP approach with both 20 and 100 year time horizons (GWP20 and GWP100, respectively, or dual-valued CO2e); (2) a variation of GWP that considers the climate impact of continuous emissions over time (known as technology warming potential (TWP); and (3) reduced complexity climate models. We use wetland restoration as a case study because studies have shown that it may remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, while also increasing methane emissions. Analyzing eleven rewetting scenarios, we find that all approaches identify temporal tradeoffs. The TWP and reduced complexity climate model results are largely consistent and reveal drawbacks of the dual-valued CO2e that considers pulse rather than continuous emissions. Given the accessibility of the TWP approach relative to reduced complexity climate models, we recommend its use for most stakeholders. Overall, our findings emphasize the need to thoroughly assess potential climate trade-offs of CDR measures across all timescales."

However, traditional linear correlation methods are insufficient for capturing reliable causal linkages, making causal discovery algorithms a more appropriate solution. Causal effect measures suggest that tropical climate anomalies exert strong driving and mediating influences during boreal summer, while the Asian climate anomalies exhibit greater sensitivity. Causal analysis identifies seven direct drivers of MLYR precipitation: pressure anomalies over northwest Pacific, Northeast Asia, mid-latitude eastern Pacific, Ural Mountains, southwest Pacific, Scandinavia and Greenland. Additionally, we uncovered the further causal pathways linking MLYR precipitation with tropical Pacific and Antarctic Oscillation signals. These results identify the detailed mediations through the direct drivers of MLYR precipitation, which are crucial to capture its remote precursors. Our findings reveal the physical attributions of MLYR precipitation from the global climate, which may improve its operational prediction skills, and even broaden the precursors of East Asian summer monsoon."

An integrated compensation algorithm was designed to account for the effects of UAV motion, attitude changes, and rotor-induced airflow on wind speed measurements. Comparative experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed compensation algorithm. 
 A hexacopter unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) was fitted with a three-dimensional sonic anemometer to measure three-dimensional wind speed. To obtain accurate results for three-dimensional wind speeds, we developed an algorithm to correct biases caused by the rotor-induced airflow disturbance, UAV movement, and attitude changes in the three-dimensional wind measurements. The wind measurement platform was built based on a custom-designed integration kit that couples seamlessly to the UAV, equipped with a payload and the sonic anemometer. Based on an accurate digital model of the integrated UAV–payload–anemometer platform, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed to quantify the wind speed disturbances caused by the rotation of the UAV's rotor on the anemometer during the UAV's steady flight under headwind, tailwind, and crosswind conditions. Through analysis of the simulated data, regression equations were developed to predict the wind speed disturbance, and a correction algorithm for rotor disturbances, motions, and attitude changes was developed. To validate the correction algorithm, we conducted a comparison study in which the integrated UAV flew around a meteorological tower from which three-dimensional wind measurements were made at multiple altitudes. Comparison between the corrected UAV wind data and those from the meteorological tower demonstrated excellent agreement. The corrections result in significant reductions in wind speed bias caused mostly by the rotors, along with notable changes in the dominant wind direction and wind speed in the original data. The algorithm enables reliable and accurate wind speed measurements in the atmospheric boundary layer made from rotorcraft UAVs."

Previous life cycle assessment (LCA) studies overlook evolving industry recycling practices and often disregard key impact categories, such as water consumption, toxicity, and resource depletion potential. Previous studies also do not evaluate battery recycling methods within the current supply chain context, specifically accounting for prevailing battery waste composition, final cathode material outputs, and varying geographic locations of recycling stages. This study compares conventional hydrometallurgy (CHR), truncated hydrometallurgy (THR), and pyrometallurgy (PR) recycling in North America, Europe, and China. This work considers each method’s recycling efficiency and the additional primary materials required to produce the new NMC811 CAM. Leaching and materials extraction contribute the most to the environmental footprint of recycling. Skipping metals’ extraction in THR leads to the lowest carbon footprint, water consumption, and toxicity.

Here, we report that quinones’ Eh is a pivotal factor in determining their capacity to facilitate long-distance electron transfer and remote reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Among a series of quinone molecules with Eh from −0.50 to 0 V, quinones from Eh = −0.25 V to −0.14 V exhibit high efficiency to mediate long-distance electron transfer excreted by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 for ROS generation. Mechanistic investigations show that quinones with Eh ≥ −0.25 V can act as terminal electron acceptors from microbial respiration. In-situ imaging results show that all reduced quinones could mediate electron transfer with a distance of 2.0–6.8 mm. Moreover, quinones with Eh ≤ −0.14 V could transfer carried electrons to oxygen molecules to generate ROS. Accordingly, 21.1% to 37.4% of redox-active moieties in aquatic and terrestrial organic matters were capable of efficiently mediating electron transfer from microbes to oxygen for ROS generation. We suggest that Eh distribution of organic matter is a pivotal parameter in the complex redox interactions between microbes, organic matter, and oxygen, thereby affecting biogeochemical processes in Earth’s surface systems."

However, the viability of this storage remains uncertain due to the unclear behavior of indigenous microorganisms in the presence of H2, which could influence the gas composition. While modeling can inform H2 dynamics, reactor-scale experiments are needed for validation. In our study, we used a high-pressure reactor to simulate injecting 2% H2 into a gas storage aquifer currently used for natural gas (CH4, 1% CO2), utilizing formation water and rock samples from the aquifer. Our research led to a kinetic model that analyzes the interactions among gas, water, rock, and microbial activities. We found that microorganisms consumed H2 and caused alkalinization, which inhibited further microbial growth and respiration. This suggests that after an initial decrease in H2 concentration, the gas storage may be stabilized in deep aquifers. Reducing CO2 levels is vital as CO2 can hinder alkalinization and enhance sulfate-reducing, methanogenic, and acetogenic activities. Notably, while H2-utilizing microorganisms were predominant, both methanogens and sulfate-reducers showed significant activity. Overall, our findings provide insights into the potential for underground H2 storage in deep aquifers, guiding future research and energy storage applications."

However, the impact of biochar particles (BCs), which are widely applied to agricultural soils, on the transformation of metastable Fh-Cd coprecipitates remains unclear. Herein, we investigated Cd behavior during the aging of Fh-BCs-Cd coprecipitates synthesized by using different BCs: pristine BC, graphitized BC (BCP), BC enriched with oxyl groups (BCO), and ash-removed BC (BCM). The incorporation of pristine BC, BCP, and BCO significantly reduced the transformation rates (K) of coprecipitates (K = 0.06–0.22 × 10–2 day–1). In contrast, Fh-BCM-Cd (K = 0.53 × 10–2 day–1) underwent a similar transformation to Fh-Cd (K = 0.71 × 10–2 day–1), forming hematite with the {104} facet and goethite with the dominant facet of {110} and incorporating 11.61% of Cd into these minerals.

Here, we constructed the first cell atlas of oyster gills at single-cell resolution level, identifying a total of 18 cell types. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of gills from oysters with high and low Cu accumulation revealed the cellular regulatory network underlying intraspecific differences in metal accumulation. For the first time, Cu-specific accumulating copperphilic cells in the oyster gills were identified, and a direct correlation was confirmed between copperphilic cell abundance and Cu content (R2 = 0.92). Trajectory analysis of cell differentiation revealed stage-specific gene module switching in metal-related cells, in which oxidative stress responses were activated in the early phase, while ion transport regulation dominated in the mature phase. Differentiation of Cu accumulation efficiency was mainly influenced by neuroendocrine-immune cells in gills maintaining physiological homeostasis, copperphilic cells selectively silencing intercellular communication, as well as ionocyte-mediated ncWNT pathway reprogramming. These results indicate a synergistic strategy by which oyster gills with high Cu accumulation enhance stress pathways (e.g., LT/RANKL) to mitigate Cu toxicity.

A single current circulation simultaneously drives ion migration for the nitrate concentration (desalination) and electron transfer for the NO3–RR, thereby achieving a 26.4% reduction in energy consumption. Moreover, enhanced nitrate removal and improved ammonia selectivity was realized by the synergistic effect between desalination and NO3–RR.

In this study, we investigated whether animals can discriminate between MP-contaminated (“dirty”) and uncontaminated (“clean”) food sources and whether such preferences can be shaped by experience. Using the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we found that individuals preferentially consumed clean bacterial prey over MP-contaminated prey via olfactory cues mediated by the odr-10 gene. Strikingly, prolonged multigenerational exposure to MP-contaminated prey led to a reversal of this preference: the progeny of exposed worms developed a learned attraction to dirty food, a phenomenon absent in associative learning-deficient mutants (lrn-1). Soil microcosm experiments confirmed that MP contamination influenced predator foraging behavior with nematodes migrating toward cleaner prey patches. Our findings reveal that microplastic pollution can reprogram predator feeding preferences through associative learning and transgenerational inheritance, with broad implications for trophic dynamics and the ecological impact of plastic contamination."

In this study, we investigated the effect of an ether group on the OH radical-initiated oxidation of dioctyl ether (DOE), a linear C16 compound with an ether group located in the center of the carbon chain, under high NOx conditions. Experiments were conducted in an environmental chamber, and gas- and particle-phase products were analyzed using gas and liquid chromatography, electron and chemical ionization mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy, and derivatization-spectrophotometry. Nitrate, hydroxynitrate, and hydroxycarbonyl ether products are analogous to those formed from the reaction of the corresponding alkane; however, the dominant product was octyl formate formed exclusively by reactions involving the ether group. Measured product yields were used with structure–activity relationships for OH and alkoxy radical reactions and literature branching ratios for the corresponding alkane reaction to determine the effect of the ether group on the branching ratio for nitrate vs alkoxy radical formation and to develop a simple model that predicted product yields in reasonable agreement with measurements. Compared to the corresponding alkane, the presence of the ether group increases OH reactivity, decreases the nitrate yield, and reduces the SOA yield by enhancing the formation of alkoxy radicals that decompose rather than isomerize to form low-volatility multifunctional products."

However, knowledge about the MC concentrations in plateau lakes experiencing high solar radiation is scarce. This study investigated the spatial-temporal distribution of MCs in eight Yunnan Plateau lakes in China, focusing on their relationships with environmental factors. Water samples (n = 63) were collected during summer and winter seasons and analyzed for MC concentrations along with a suite of environmental variables. Results revealed significant seasonal and spatial variations in MC concentrations, with higher levels in eutrophic lakes Dianchi, Erhai, and Xingyunhu. Notably, mean MC concentrations in Lake Dianchi during summer and Erhai during winter exceeded the World Health Organization’s provisional guideline of 1 μg/L for drinking water. Seasonal analyses revealed distinct regulatory mechanisms: MC concentrations in summer were positively correlated with total phosphorus, total nitrogen, turbidity, and chlorophyll a, reflecting the influence of eutrophication on cyanobacterial growth. While solar radiation intensity (SRI) exhibited a dual role: moderate SRI in winter was associated with higher MC levels, whereas higher SRI in summer suppressed MC production, likely due to photoinhibition or MC degradation. Strikingly, water temperature showed no significant correlation with MC concentrations, suggesting that high solar radiation in the Yunnan Plateau may override temperature-dependent effects on cyanobacterial growth. These findings highlight the importance of nutrient management and the regulatory role of solar radiation in regulating MC production in high-altitude lakes. The study underscores the need for region-specific strategies to mitigate cyanobacterial risks, particularly in drinking water source lakes, by integrating nutrient control and the unique light regime of plateau ecosystems."

After 4 weeks of exposure, zebrafish ovaries exhibited polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)-like changes, including polycystic ovaries, reduced spawning rates, and elevated androgen levels. Moreover, ETO was transmitted to offspring via maternal ovaries, significantly increasing larval mortality and deformity rates while reducing their locomotor activity. Transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling revealed oxidative stress responses, disrupted unsaturated fatty acid and glutathione metabolism, and damage to ovarian granulosa cells and the zona pellucida, as confirmed by reactive oxygen species (ROS) fluorescence staining. Combined multiomics analysis demonstrated that ETO exposure exacerbated ovarian oxidative stress, impaired the functional structure of ovaries, and disrupted follicular cell maturation via hyperactivation of the mechanistic target of the rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway.

Here, we show that upper ocean salt transport due to eddy stirring and trapping effects displays a strong zonal dependence on the global ocean, with the former playing a dominant role over the analysis period. The zonal accumulation of meridional salt transport reaches a maximum of −4.52 psu·Sv (×106 psu·m3·s−1) in the Southern Ocean. Equivalent freshwater transport is poleward in the near‐equator region and equatorward in the near‐polar region, consequently causing freshwater to converge in the middle of the subtropical gyre. The divergence of salt transport further suggests that eddies transport salt out of the maximum sea surface salinity regions. Strong seasonal variations in salt transport occur mainly in eddy‐enriched regions such as the western boundary currents and the Southern Ocean. The relative contribution of eddy stirring and trapping effects to oceanic meridional salt transport can reach approximately 23.6%.

Yet, replays occurred predominantly at locations that were both spatially and temporally distant from the replayed behavior, and their speed scaled with trajectory length, challenging existing models of replay mechanisms. During flight, neural ensembles exhibited fast representational sweeps, where the decoded location cyclically moved ahead of the bat’s position. In contrast to reports in rodents, sweeps occurred in the absence of theta oscillations and were instead phase-locked to a prominent motor behavioral rhythm - the bat’s wingbeat cycle. This suggests that behaviorally-relevant sensorimotor rhythms can interact with hippocampal ensemble dynamics in a highly structured manner. Combined, our findings challenge existing models of ensemble dynamics in the mammalian hippocampus and highlight the importance of comparative studies under ethologically relevant conditions for elucidating brain function."

 Cross-species transmission of coronaviruses (CoVs) poses a serious threat to both animal and human health1-3. Whilst the large RNA genome of CoVs shows relatively low mutation rates, recombination within genera is frequently observed4-7. Companion animals are often overlooked in the transmission cycle of viral diseases; however, the close relationship of feline (FCoV) and canine CoV (CCoV) to human hCoV-229E5,8, as well as their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-29 highlight their importance in potential transmission cycles. Whilst recombination between CCoV and FCoV of a large fragment spanning orf1b to M has been previously described5,10, here we report the emergence of a novel, highly pathogenic FCoV-CCoV recombinant responsible for a rapidly spreading outbreak of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), originating in Cyprus11. The minor recombinant region, spanning spike (S), shows 96.5% sequence identity to the pantropic canine coronavirus NA/09. Infection has rapidly spread, infecting cats of all ages. Development of FIP appears very frequent and sequence identities of samples from cats in different districts of the island is strongly supportive of direct transmission. A near cat-specific deletion in the domain 0 of S is present in >90% of FIP cats. It is unclear as yet whether this deletion is directly associated with disease development and may be linked to a biotype switch12. The domain 0 deletion and several amino acid changes in S, particularly the receptor binding domain, indicate potential changes to receptor binding and cell tropism."

 Antarctic bed topography influences how the overlying ice sheet responds to climate change and provides a record of long-term glacial history. However, knowledge of the processes that governed the development of the landscape before glacial inception and how this modulated subsequent ice-sheet evolution remains limited. Here we use radio-echo sounding to reveal extensive flat surfaces beneath the ice margin between Princess Elizabeth Land and George V Land, East Antarctica. When their elevations are isostatically adjusted for unloading of the present-day ice load, these surfaces cluster at 200–450 metres above sea level and dip gently in an offshore direction. We show that the surfaces are fragments of a once-contiguous coastal plain formed by fluvial erosion, which dates from between the separation of East Antarctica from Australia (~100–80 Ma) and the onset of Southern Hemisphere ice-sheet glaciation (~34 Ma). The preservation of these landforms indicates a lack of intense, selective erosion of the surfaces throughout Antarctica’s glacial history. Fast-flowing ice has instead been directed through inherited tectonic structures and fluvial valleys, leading to the incision of overdeepened subglacial troughs between the flat surfaces and thus modulating the responsiveness of the ice sheet to climate change. Extensive flat surfaces observed beneath the East Antarctic Ice Sheet margin were formed by fluvial erosion and have modulated the ice-sheet response to climate change, according to an analysis of radio-echo sounding data."

The discovery explains leakage and switching losses in GaN power devices and points to defect-guided design strategies. 
 Dislocations significantly influence carrier transport in semiconductors. While segments orthogonal to the channel act as scattering centers impeding conduction, electrically active dislocation cores can facilitate carrier transport. However, the mechanisms governing carrier transport along dislocation cores remain unclear. Here, we provide the first experimental evidence for the separate transport mechanisms of electrons and holes mediated by threading screw dislocations and threading edge dislocations in gallium nitride. Critically, we demonstrate that devices with a higher total dislocation density exhibit less degradation due to current collapse, owing to a larger proportion of edge dislocations mitigating electron trapping caused by screw dislocations. Screw dislocations promote electron leakage via horizontal potential barriers and vertically connected shallow states, while edge dislocations enhance hole transport through extended trap levels interacting with buffer defects. These findings clarify the long-standing debate on carrier-specific dislocation transport mechanisms and offer critical insights for defect engineering, epitaxial growth optimization, and the development of dislocation-enhanced semiconductor devices.

This study reveals that when sensing host albumin, C. albicans, even avirulent strains, can trigger an alternative pathogenicity pathway via transcriptional and metabolic reprogramming. 
 Pathogenicity mechanisms of the yeast Candida albicans involve filamentous growth, adhesion, invasion, and toxin production. Interestingly, clinical isolates, and other Candida spp., can cause infection independent of filamentation or toxin production. These strains and species often are characterized as avirulent ex vivo, yet this does not correlate with their potential to cause infection. We hypothesized that specific host factors, which trigger pathogenicity in vivo, are absent in in vitro infection models and thereby clinical isolates can seem avirulent ex vivo. We investigated how albumin, the most abundant protein in humans, impacts infection and cytotoxic potential of C. albicans in vitro. The presence of albumin induces otherwise non-damaging and non-filamentous clinical isolates to cause host cell cytotoxicity. Moreover, avirulent deletion mutants deficient in filamentation, adhesion, or toxin production are restored in their cytotoxicity by albumin. This involves transcriptional and metabolic reprogramming of C. albicans, increasing biofilm formation and production of the oxylipin 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, driving host cell cytotoxicity. Collectively, our study uncoveres a pathogenicity mechanism by which C. albicans causes epithelial cytotoxicity independent of its conventional virulence mechanisms. This alternative pathogenicity strategy helps to explain the avirulence of clinical isolates ex vivo, when they are separated from the host environment.

 The rise of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, particularly gram-negative bacteria, highlights the urgent need for novel therapeutics. Drug-resistant infections now contribute to approximately 5 million deaths annually, yet traditional antibiotic discovery has significantly stagnated. Venoms form an immense and largely untapped reservoir of bioactive molecules with antimicrobial potential. In this study, we mined global venomics datasets to identify new antimicrobial candidates. Using deep learning, we explored 16,123 venom proteins, generating 40,626,260 venom-encrypted peptides. From these, we identified 386 candidates that are structurally and functionally distinct from known antimicrobial peptides. They display high net charge and elevated hydrophobicity, characteristics conducive to bacterial-membrane disruption. Structural studies revealed that many of these peptides adopt flexible conformations that transition to α-helical conformations in membrane-mimicking environments, supporting their antimicrobial potential. Of the 58 peptides selected for experimental validation, 53 display potent antimicrobial activity. Mechanistic assays indicated that they primarily exert their effects through bacterial-membrane depolarization, mirroring AMP-like mechanisms. In a murine model of Acinetobacter baumannii infection, lead peptides significantly reduced bacterial burden without observable toxicity. Our findings demonstrate that venoms are a rich source of previously hidden antimicrobial scaffolds, and that integrating large-scale computational mining with experimental validation can accelerate the discovery of urgently needed antibiotics.

Once-daily obeldesivir treatment was efficacious against RSV in a non-human primate model. 
 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in high-risk populations. Although prophylactic options are available, there are no effective oral therapeutics for RSV infection. Obeldesivir (ODV) is an orally bioavailable prodrug of the nucleoside analog GS-441524, which is converted intracellularly to its active nucleoside triphosphate and inhibits the RSV RNA polymerase. Here we report the potent antiviral activity of ODV against geographically and temporally diverse RSV A and B clinical isolates (EC50: 0.20–0.66 μM). Resistance selection studies with ODV and GS-441524 against RSV identify a single amino acid substitution, I777L, in the L polymerase with reduced susceptibility (3.3-3.8-fold) to ODV and GS-441524, indicating a high barrier for resistance development. In an African green monkey RSV infection model, once-daily oral ODV doses of 30 or 90 mg/kg initiated ~24 hours post-infection significantly reduces log10 viral RNA copies/mL × day area under the curve by 69–92% in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Together, these preclinical data support the clinical evaluation of ODV for the treatment of RSV infection.

 Global surface temperatures since the 1980s, when near-global satellite-based sea surface temperature (SST) measurements became available, are presumed to be well known. Satellite-era warming trends in four commonly used global (land and ocean) temperature reconstructions agree closely, yet whether SST datasets also agree is unclear. Here we show that trends in four widely used SST datasets show first-order differences, with 1982–2024 60° S to 60° N trends ranging from 0.108 to 0.184 °C per decade. These large discrepancies are perplexing given the agreement between global temperature datasets and the fact that 70% of the surface of the Earth is covered by ocean, but are legible upon recognizing that global temperature datasets use two SST fields whose trends agree more closely than those of the four SST datasets. Considering the trend uncertainty across SST datasets widens the range of plausible global temperature trends and impacts interpretations of recent record global temperatures, with implications for observational and model-based climate studies.

 Biological wastewater treatment (BWT) is critical to safeguard the aqueous environment. However, enzyme activities in microbial metabolism are inhibited by low temperatures, making BWT implementation in cold environments challenging. Here we propose a strategy to endow BWT facilities with low-temperature operation resilience by integrating photothermal technology with BWT using photothermal carriers (PTCs). Specifically, α-Fe2O3@polyaniline was coated onto a high-conductivity SiC ceramic matrix on a PTC, forming functional partitions for bacterial colonization. The upper layers of the PTCs have an interlaced porous structure and photothermal functions, which provided stable energy conversion and light shielding. The heat conducted downward formed a mesophilic, lightless zone in the lower PTC layers, resulting in high thermal conduction and bioaffinity. Consequently, anammox bacteria, a key biome for sustainable BWT, can be enriched in these PTCs, as evidenced by a 21.4% increase in abundance and a 2.2-fold increase in biomass. With the use of PTCs in a BWT facility under 0.6 kW m−2 illumination, the nitrogen removal performance at low temperature (15 °C) was 5.8 times higher than the case without the use of PTCs. Overall, this work shows how solar energy can be used to enhance the resilience of BWT to low temperatures, improving the applicability of BWT in cold regions.

 Latitudinal variations in the carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratio of particulate organic matter are well-established, but vertical (depth) variations within the euphotic zone remain largely unexplored. Here, we found that C:N ratios (mol:mol) of three size fractions of particulate organic matter exceeded the canonical Redfield ratio of 6.6 within the low-nutrient upper euphotic zone in the stratified northwest Sargasso Sea. In larger particles ( >20 μm), these ratios reached as high as 10–16. Elevated C:N ratios in all size fractions of particles (0.3 to >20 μm) in the upper euphotic zone coincided with the accumulation of glucose-rich carbohydrates. In contrast, particles within or below the nitracline, within the lower euphotic zone (~90–140 m), exhibited C:N ratios of <6.6 and contained comparatively less carbohydrate and greater amounts of amino acids. Additionally, patterns in the composition of individual carbohydrate monomers suggest that the vertical variations originate from both primary production and degradative processes. These variations in particle composition over depth will affect the stoichiometry in models of primary production, microbial remineralization, and carbon export.

 Evaluating heavy metals bioavailable is crucial for comprehensive soil contamination assessment but challenging at large scales due to complex and resource-intensive analytical procedures, and the amount of dissolved metal in soils represents the relative solubility and potential mobility of cadmium, which is a key factor determining bioavailability. Here, we developed a geochemical-integrated machine learning framework using multi-source data to predict cadmium speciation distribution in European and Chinese non-industrial topsoils. Average total cadmium content in Chinese topsoils (0.41 mg kg−1) was ~10.8% higher than the Europe, while average dissolved cadmium content (113.2 μg L−1) was ~16.8% higher. Mechanistic interpretation revealed that lower pH, soil organic matter, and amorphous ferrihydrite contents mainly attributed to the higher bioavailability in China.

Annually, 4,269 ha (16 %) disadopted low-intensity tillage, but this was offset by an increase in adoption, with fields totaling 5,878 ha under low-intensity tillage in 2022 that had been under high-intensity tillage in 2011. The second component tested the ability of remote sensing to align with this detailed, human-labeled survey of tillage intensity. We extracted 14 spectral indices from Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2, texture metrics from the Grey Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM), and environmental factors from the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and SSURGO soil dataset. We evaluated multiple composition techniques and machine-learning models and found that the Random Forest model trained with bimonthly composited images provided the best accuracies of tillage intensity (0.65) and tillage change (0.57), aligning with or surpassing previous studies. By examining crop tillage dynamics over a longer period and across more heterogeneous landscapes, this study provides a more comprehensive analysis to mapping tillage practices at broader temporal and spatial scales."

 Geospatial modeling aims to integrate multiple geospatial data sources and geoprocessing functions based on user application demands to address complex geospatial challenges. While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in semantic understanding and task planning, their limited geospatial domain knowledge still hinders their efficiency in geospatial modeling. Therefore, there is an urgent need to integrate geospatial knowledge with the inherent semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs, enabling their effective application in specialized geospatial domains. In this study, we introduce GeoGraphRAG, a graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach tailored for geospatial modeling. Specifically, GeoGraphRAG utilizes LLMs as intelligent agents to identify user demands, retrieve relevant subgraphs from external graph knowledge base, and injects both structural and semantic information into the LLM. Through the graph-driven solution planning phase, GeoGraphRAG automatically generates modeling solutions and geospatial code in response to specific user demands. The proposed method is evaluated against different baseline approaches across various LLMs based on the benchmark dataset designed for geospatial modeling, and a representative application scenario is presented to illustrate its practical effectiveness. Our experimental results demonstrate that the injection of graph-structured knowledge improves both the efficiency and interpretability of LLM-based geospatial modeling, thereby confirming the effectiveness of our proposed approach. GeoGraphRAG represents the first attempt to introduce graph-based RAG into geospatial modeling and provides novel insights for future research and practical applications in this field."

 Atmospheric ammonia (NH3) emissions and depositions have been linked to negative effects on human health and biodiversity. National monitoring networks have documented large spatial variation of NH3 concentrations related to agricultural activities, including livestock pollution. Little is known about spatial and temporal variation of livestock-related ammonia concentrations in areas where residential and nature areas are located nearby intensive livestock farming. The objective of this study was to assess the spatial and temporal variability of ambient ammonia in such a mixed land-use area within the Netherlands.A dense air quality network was set up with 71 sites spanning over 1027 km2 within rural and semi-urban (small towns) areas, and nature reserves. Ambient ammonia concentrations were measured monthly with passive samplers from March 2022 to February 2024.Ammonia measurements showed large spatial and temporal variation. Spatial variation was related to the number of livestock farms in a 3000m buffer around sites and inverse distance to the nearest farm. Mean concentrations were 13.6 μg/m3 (rural), 9.6 μg/m3 (semi-urban) and 5.1 μg/m3 (nature sites). Seasonal patterns, highest in spring and lowest in winter, were similar in rural, semi-urban and natural sites. The highest concentrations were observed in March 2022, coinciding with manure application and stable weather conditions. Temporal variability related to temperature, rainfall, manure application, atmospheric pressure and relative humidity. Multivariate models explained 52–80 % of the temporal variance component, depending on time period. Our spatial and temporal analyses provide further evidence that farming emissions impact NH3 concentrations both locally and at greater distances."

 Bioaerosols, comprising airborne biological particles such as bacteria, fungi, pollen, and viruses, significantly impact atmospheric processes, public health, and environmental monitoring. With the aim to achieve better resolution in the assessment of the airborne diversity, this study explores applicability of targeted high-throughput sequencing of airborne eDNA to recover bacterial and fungal communities, and to identify pathogens relevant for agriculture, forestry, and human health. Aerobiome samples were collected using standard Hirst type volumetric approach and the SASS2300 high volume wetted wall cyclone sampler (300 l min−1) coupled with the SASS4000 concentrator (4000 l min−1). Real Time PCR was used to confirm presence of bacterial, fungal, and plant DNA in total eDNA extracted from aerobiome samples. A targeted long read amplicon approach was used to recover airborne bacterial and fungal diversity in high volume air samples. In total, 741 bacterial and 1210 fungal OTUs were identified. Gammaprotebacteria and Agaricomycetes, with relative abundance over 50 %, were the most dominant bacterial and fungal classes, respectively. Cladosporium was the most abundant fungal genus. Potential plant, animal, and human pathogens were identified. However, the results should be interpreted cautiously since taxonomic identification of OTUs is highly influenced by the completeness of available databases. This study provided insights into overall airborne bacterial and fungal diversity and its ever-changing nature, highlighting the significance of air as a transmission medium of potentially pathogenic microorganisms relevant to agricultural crops, food and feed systems, forestry, and human health."

 The occurrence of severe convective weather (SCW) often poses significant threats to socio-economic stability and public safety. Monitoring the evolution of convective clouds can provide critical support for timely severe weather warnings. We utilize Himawari-8/9 geostationary satellite imagery to identify severe convective clouds (SCCs) within large-scale regions through a multi-threshold sliding window (MTSW) algorithm, with validation using ground-based radar reflectivity data and real-world weather cases. Additionally, 507 SCW events were analyzed using Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) data and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) datasets to investigate their relationship with the identified 12,177 SCCs. Finally, deep learning methods were further introduced to explore the quantitative correlation between SCCs and SCW. Key findings include: (1) Strong consistency between satellite-identified SCCs and high-reflectivity zones observed by ground-based radar; (2) The algorithm effectively detects convective clouds at various developmental stages, achieving an identification accuracy of 85 %; (3) Spatiotemporal analysis reveals that more than 90 % of severe convective weather (SCW) occurs within the coverage of SCCs and a 40 km buffer zone surrounding their boundaries, although the presence of SCCs does not necessarily lead to SCW; (4) By applying deep learning, the model attained a mean Intersection over Union (MIoU) score of 78 % in segmenting severe convective weather within SCCs. These findings enhance the application potential of geostationary satellites, deepen understanding of severe convective mechanisms, and improve forecasting precision."

We combined isotope labeling, computed-tomography three-dimensional models, behavioral field experiments, and mathematical models to show thatSquamellariaplant hosts reduce conflict among their multiple ant symbiont species by offering nesting sites (domatia) divided into compartments with separate entrances. As long as compartmentalization is maintained, different symbiont species can peacefully coexist, but experimental removal of compartment walls leads to deadly conflicts.

Despite these differences, neurotransmitter identities remain largely conserved, indicating that functional dimorphism arises through modulatory, not identity-defining, changes. We show that sex-biased expression of neurotransmitter-related genes correlates with bias in outgoing synaptic connectivity and identify regulatory candidates for synaptic wiring, including both shared and sex-specific genes. This dataset provides a molecular framework for understanding how subtle regulatory differences tune conserved circuits to drive sex-specific behaviors."

A key breakthrough in understanding this pool is the identification of biorefractory carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecules (CRAM). Recent studies have challenged the biorecalcitrance of CRAM but lacked detailed molecular evidence. Using advanced online countergradient liquid chromatography–Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry to track microbial incubation, we revealed a wide spectrum of CRAM bioavailability regulated by molecular polarity. CRAM with lower polarity were preferentially degraded, whereas microbial reworking led to production of higher-polarity CRAM, characterized by increased oxidation state, nitrogen content, and aromaticity. Some microbially transformed CRAM were frequently detected in a global DOM dataset of 1485 seawater samples, suggesting their potential persistence in marine environments. This study provides molecular insights into the biorecalcitrance and transformation pathway of CRAM, underscoring the complexity and dynamic nature of marine organic carbon cycling."

While DOX-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC) involves epigenetic changes, no systematic epigenetic intervention studies have been reported. Here, we identified BRD4770 as a potential small molecule against DIC through the Epigenetics Compound Library screening. BRD4770 inhibited DOX-induced cardiomyocyte ferroptosis and apoptosis by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and lipid peroxidation and maintaining glutathione homeostasis. BRD4770 treatment alleviated DIC without affecting the antitumor effects of DOX. Mechanistically, BRD4770 promoted nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)–solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) signaling and suppressed DOX-induced cardiomyocyte death by reducing methylation of lysine 9 on histone 3. Last, we constructed a ROS-responsive nanoliposome loaded with BRD4770 and conjugated with the cardiac-targeting peptide for primary cardiomyocyte, which provided better protection against DIC. These findings suggest that BRD4770 has the potential to prevent cardiomyocyte death–related cardiomyopathy."

Polyubiquitination plays a role in proteasome-mediated protein turnover; however, additional functions for specific types of polyubiquitin linkages have been identified. One type of polyubiquitination, K63-polyubiquitin (K63-polyUb), has been studied for its role in signal transduction within the context of cancer, but little has been done to uncover its role regarding neuronal and synaptic function. Here, we report an emerging function for the cytosolic PSD-95 interactor, cypin, in the regulation of synaptic content by K63-polyUb during neuronal development in vitro and in adult mice in vivo. We identify cypin-promoted K63-polyUb on postsynaptic proteins and also find an important role for cypin in presynaptic function. Our work demonstrates that cypin-promoted changes to K63-polyUb can regulate synaptic content and function on both sides of the synapse, adding important insight into basic mechanisms of neuronal signaling."

Here, we used the adhesion GPCR D1 (ADGRD1/GPR133) as a model to unveil a strategy for finding exogenous agonists that target adhesion GPCRs while revealing previously unidentified functions of ADGRD1. We identified the small molecule GL64 as a selective agonist of ADGRD1. GL64 activates ADGRD1 by mimicking thestachelsequence. Using GL64 as a chemical tool, we demonstrated that ADGRD1 negatively regulates bone loss by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis. The cAMP-PKA-NFATC1 pathway was identified as the downstream signaling pathway of ADGRD1 in osteoclasts. Furthermore, administering GL64 prevented bone loss and suppressed osteoclast activity in the osteoporosis mouse model induced by ovariectomy.

To address this question, we used a chemogenetic approach to selectively stimulate G12/13signaling in POMC neurons. We found that receptor-mediated activation of G12/13signaling in POMC neurons caused notable improvements in glucose homeostasis in lean and obese mice. Stimulation of G12/13signaling in POMC neurons also enhanced the physiological actions of leptin. Studies with G12/13knockout mice showed that G12/13signaling in POMC neurons mediated the beneficial metabolic effects of lorcaserin, an appetite-suppressant drug that selectively activates serotonin 5-HT2Creceptors.

Here, we found that the transition from cellular senescence to pyroptosis promoted small cell lung cancer (SCLC) recurrence after cisplatin and etoposide treatment. Parts of the senescent SCLC cells induced by chemotherapy showed positive cytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCFs), and CCFs activated the ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20, which stabilized NLRP3 through its deubiquitinating activity, resulting in senescent cells undergoing pyroptosis. Subsequent inflammatory factors [such as interleukin-1 (IL-1)] released by pyroptosis promoted the acquisition of stem-like properties in CCF-negative senescent cells, ultimately promoting tumor recurrence.

Despite its advantages in inhibiting multidrug-resistant bacteria and eliminating biofilms, phage therapy suffers low phage vitality, limited ocular retention, and lack of anti-inflammatory abilities toward ocular infections. Here, wearing phages individually with an adhesive drug-loadable nanohelmet is reported to advance phage therapy. The nanohelmet is formed by depositing arginine-glycine-aspartic acid–modified chitosan on negatively charged phage head through electrostatic interactions, followed by codepositing anti-inflammatory agents via physical adsorption. Nanohelmet formation shows a negligible influence on phage vitality and is applicable to helmet diverse phages. Because of the cationic nature and the presence of arginine-glycine-aspartic acid sequence, such nanohelmet exhibits a double-lock adhesion fashion to ocular surface, prolonging phage retention after instillation. Together with sustained drug release, helmeted phages potently inhibit bacteria, eliminate biofilms, and effectively suppress localized inflammation.

The Cape Verde Islands are located 600 km off the coast of Africa and are characterized by arid environments and high-salinity soils. Here, we find thatArabidopsis thalianaplants native to these islands accumulate glucuronyl-mannose that protects them from salt stress. We map the ability to produce this metabolite to an α glycosidase family 38 gene that we namedGH38cv. Plants carrying mutant alleles of GH38cv do not present defects on growth, fitness, or biotic resistance under standard laboratory conditions but show better germination rates, longer roots, better hydric status, and higher fitness than nonmutated plants when exposed to salt stress. Notably, deleterious mutations in GH38cv have evolved independently on two separate islands within the Cape Verde archipelago, illustrating an example of parallel evolution for salt tolerance in this environment.

Here, we demonstrate that BAP1 suppresses CRC progression primarily by deubiquitinating and stabilizing von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL). BAP1 undergoes covalent modification by ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (UFM1) at Lys51, Lys61, Lys187, and Lys205, enhancing its interaction with pVHL and promoting pVHL stabilization. Loss of this modification through UFL1 depletion or reconstitution with a UFMylation-defective BAP1 mutant (4KR) impairs pVHL stabilization and promotes tumor progression in CRC cell line–based and patient-derived xenograft models. Clinically, down-regulation of UFL1 and BAP1 correlates with reduced pVHL level and poor prognosis in patients with CRC. These findings identify a previously unrecognized posttranslational mechanism regulating BAP1 activity and highlight UFMylation as essential for maintaining pVHL tumor-suppressive function.

An alternate strategy to combat immune cold breast tumors may be to reeducate innate immunity. This study identifies strategies to skew neutrophils to acquire tumoricidal properties. Systemic Toll-like receptor (TLR)–induced inflammation, concomitant with mitochondrial complex I inhibition in breast tumors, increases neutrophil cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells and independently of CD8+ T cell immunity. These therapy-entrained neutrophils enhance secretory granule production, increasing expression of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase machinery and inducing a respiratory burst. Moreover, systemic administration of TLR agonists elevates nuclear factor κB signaling in neutrophils to increase production of secretory granule and NADPH oxidase machinery components, whereas complex I inhibitors are required to potentiate oxidative damage.

The prevailing view suggests that trenchward continental motion drives slab overthrusting, causing the flat slab to expand oceanward. Here, we explore an alternative mechanism: underthrusting of the subducting plate through forward propagation of the flat-slab hinge. We directly evaluate both hypotheses through a kinematic analysis of trench and flat-slab motions using a global flat subduction database cast into multiple absolute plate motion models. Our results indicate that flat-slab expansion reflects distinct end-member processes, with forward propagation emerging as the dominant mode. We present a framework for flat-slab propagation that emphasizes the dynamic interaction between lower-plate motion and slab pull from adjacent subduction zones, an interplay validated through numerical modeling.

The Arctic climate is rapidly changing, and it is not known how the Arctic Ocean overturning circulation is responding. Here, we use a high-resolution ocean reanalysis, corroborated by observations, to show that a poleward expansion of warm Atlantic waters and corresponding sea-ice loss, a phenomenon referred to as an “Atlantification” of the Arctic, has caused a poleward shift of the dense water source regions in recent decades (1993–2020). This is manifested in enhanced surface water mass transformation in the Arctic Ocean, compensating for a reduction in the Nordic Seas.

It includes structural, geographic, and operational data for over 300 hydropower plants and their related reservoirs and water intakes. Validated through modeling, IAR-HP accurately reproduces observed hydropower, capturing 96.2 % of actual production. 
 Climate change raises the critical need to understand its impact on water resources, particularly as hydropower's role as a flexible, renewable energy source becomes more vital in planning for the energy system's decarbonization. While hydrological modeling represents an established tool for assessing the future evolution of water resources, a key challenge lies in its reliance on data describing the geometry and operation of hydropower systems interacting with the natural stream network. The Italian Alpine Region (IAR) is home to over 300 large hydropower systems (LHSs), and its hydrological cycle is expected to suffer major alterations due to climate change. However, detailed and reliable hydrological studies in this region face hindrances due to the absence of a consistent, comprehensive, and openly available LHS source.We present IAR-HP (Italian Alpine Region HydroPower), a comprehensive inventory specifically designed for the inclusion in hydrological modeling of LHSs located in the Italian Alpine Region, to overcome this obstacle. This dataset aims to support modelers in the water–energy nexus by providing crucial information for accurately informing their models. Compiled from various online sources, IAR-HP is openly accessible and reproducible, offering a solution to the scarcity of data hindering effective storage-hydropower-related simulations. The dataset includes detailed information about 338 LHSs, with a collective installed power of 14.3 GW and an average production of 32.1 TW h yr−1; these LHSs contribute 11.8 % of the electricity generated in Italy, corresponding to roughly 80 % of the national hydropower generation. The dataset was validated through a hydropower production modeling exercise, and was able to reconstruct 96.2 % of the observed hydropower production across the Italian Alpine Region. By presenting this dataset, we contribute a practical tool for scientists to reduce the inherent uncertainty of hydrological models, improving their ability to represent large hydropower systems accurately. IAR-HP holds potential for numerous applications to inform decision-making in the dynamic context of climate change.

A decade of records were reanalyzed with automatic methods, identifying over 6900 events, of which only 60% were earthquakes, confirming the need for manual review. The revised seismicity reveals that seismic sources are located deep in the lower crust in the centre Gargano and at intermediate crust along the Mattinata fault in the southern Gargano. 
 The Gargano Promontory (hereafter GP) has attracted the attention of seismologists in recent years for its peculiarities regarding the high rate of low-magnitude seismicity and focal depths in the lower crust. These peculiarities have been highlighted thanks to the new data provided by the OTRIONS seismic network (hereafter OT), installed in 2013 in the GP area, consisting of 15 short-period seismometers, thanks to a fruitful collaboration between UniBa (University of Bari Aldo Moro) and INGV (Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia). The first available seismic catalog refers to the first 7 year of the network operation (2013–2018) suffered of some technological problems of the acquisition system. Thanks to improvements in the data transmission system, these problems were overcome in 2019 and now the OT network data are available in real time. In order to include the most recent seismicity and to cover the temporal gaps existing in the previous catalog, we thoroughly reviewed the 24h seismic recordings, collected over the decade after the installation, by employing an automatic detect and picking software (CASP, Complete Automatic Seismic Processor). More than 6900 seismic events were initially identified. Through careful manual review, approximately 60 % were confirmed as local earthquakes, and the others were recognized as quarry blasts or false/poorly-located events. Manual revision significantly improved the quality of P- and S-phase picks, which led to more accurate earthquakes locations by both linearized and non-linear algorithms obtaining 2 catalogs both here released. This study highlights the value of semi-automated analysis for seismic catalog compilation but manual revision is still necessary. The quality of the catalogs was assessed in detail using statistical parameters and a new formula for the location quality. The completeness magnitude of the new catalogs is as low as 0.82. The noise affecting the network was also evaluated. This study confirms the importance of the OT local network for seismic hazard analysis and provides a useful data set for seismotectonic and geophysical studies in a long under-monitored region."

With the aim of quantifying the spatiotemporal risk of nonferrous metal industrial sites in China from 1990 to 2020, this study performed hazard, vulnerability, and risk factor analyses to explore the trend of risk changes and reveal the effectiveness of pollution control efforts. Results showed that the potential risk of nonferrous metal industrial sites exhibited nonlinear changes, increasing from 13.49% in 1990 to 16.41% in 2000, peaking at 23.17% in 2010, and then declining to 19.06% in 2020. Moreover, with the increasing number of contaminated sites, the spatial distribution of potential risks showed pattern of dispersion followed by concentration, with lower risks in most areas. Finally, spatiotemporal risk variations were considerably affected by source–smelting and mining, pathway–wind and surface runoff, and receptor–socioeconomic development and population agglomeration. The proposed methodology can help decision-makers identify specific risk areas and patterns of variation over long-term scales and large-scale regions."

The present study investigated the effect of positioning and degree of chlorination and bromination on potency relative to an unsubstituted PAH for in vitro activation of zebrafish (Danio rerio) AhR2 and potency for zebrafish early life-stage mortality. Anthracene did not activate the AhR2, but chlorination and bromination strongly affected potency in a position-dependent manner. Seven of 11 halogenated PAHs activated the AhR2 with potency generally increasing with number of substitutions. Bromination had a larger effect on potency than chlorination. Potency for early life-stage toxicity followed the same rank order as that for AhR2 activation.

However, answering questions about their physical mechanisms and how they may evolve in the future is challenging because of their rareness. Here we investigate the evolution of the mechanisms leading to heat extremes in Western Europe with climate change. We use a rare event algorithm to increase the number of extremely hot summers in Western Europe simulated in the IPSL‐CM6A‐LR climate model under present, SSP2‐4.5 and SSP3‐7.0 forcings. We show that centennial hot summers arise because of a succession of heatwaves, occurring through the local amplification of a synoptic scale Rossby wave packet and the advection of sensible heat from eastward regions. The atmospheric dynamics of these summers become more local in the future, and more driven by regional diabatic heat fluxes than by the large scale organization of the atmosphere."

However, during global cooling, the teleconnection from the tropical Pacific weakens, reducing its impact on downward longwave radiation and sea ice recovery.

Evaluations against satellite retrievals confirmed the effectiveness of FWI as a predictor of fire activity in Eurasia.

The short‐range hindcast approach ensures a faithful comparison of model resolution in simulating the same storm events under a controlled large‐scale environment. Using a phenomenon‐based framework, we attribute precipitation to specific storm types: tropical cyclones (TCs), extratropical cyclones, atmospheric rivers, and mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). Our findings show that E3SM hindcasts with both HR and LR configurations significantly underestimate storm‐associated precipitation intensity but overestimate precipitation from other sources. Furthermore, both HR and LR hindcasts face significant challenges in accurately simulating extreme precipitation events, particularly over MCS hotspots. Nevertheless, HR simulations capture more detailed and intense precipitation patterns with an improved representation of storm dynamics. HR hindcasts produce 16% more storm precipitation compared to LR. For precipitation extremes, HR simulates a 33% higher 99th percentile precipitation magnitudes compared to LR, and most of the increment comes from these four heavy‐precipitating storm types. The increase in precipitation mainly comes from stratiform precipitation rather than convective precipitation. The improvement in HR simulations varies across different storm types with TC showing the largest improvement. The phenomenon‐based approach provides important insights into precipitation simulations especially for extremes.

First, we determine all the HWs that occurred in the AMB during the last climatological period of 30 years (1991–2020) and simulate each individual event using the Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF) model at high‐resolution. Then, these historical HW events are resimulated with the modified atmospheric conditions of the midcentury (2041–2070) and the end of the century (2071–2100) according to the scenario SSP3‐7.0, in which CO2 emissions are projected to almost double from current levels by 2100 following a low emission reduction scenario. In the AMB, HW intensity is expected to increase by 2.5°C and 4.2°C in the mid‐ and end‐of‐the‐century periods, respectively. Higher temperatures are related to the stationary and stable synoptic pattern, which, among the four analyzed, is projected to experience the greatest intensification in the future.

A promising strategy requires identifying leverage points, namely key elements and processes where interventions can generate significant systemic change. However, leverage points are often difficult to discover and typically treated as static nodes rather than evolving and uncertain. To overcome this gap, qualitative and quantitative System Dynamics modeling tools are combined with other system‐analysis methods. Unlike traditional approaches, the proposed modeling framework analyses leverage points as key dynamic elements, links, and feedback loops that activate and shift in intensity based on system state. The modeling process, applied to the Pinios River Basin (PRB) in Greece, helped revealing critical leverage points, including factors such as groundwater quality and agricultural productivity, key causal influences like the impact of natural areas' condition on agrotourism, and relevant feedback loops, such as the reinforcing dynamic driving the decline of natural areas. Deterministic and stochastic simulations contributed to validate the robustness of the modeling framework, with stochastic methods providing additional insights into the variability and uncertainty of system behavior. Recurring leverage points across simulations proved essential to drive effective management during critical transitions. Beyond the PRB, this modeling process provides a versatile framework for understanding and managing complex multi‐sector systems, applicable to different contexts to support strategic decision‐making toward sustainability and cascading impacts mitigation."

 To what extent overdominance might contribute to the maintenance of genetic diversity within genomes is still an ongoing research question. Pseudo-overdominance created by the complementation of deleterious alleles in heterozygotes has recently become a subject of particular interest. Simulations and theory suggest that pseudo-overdominance may occur in low recombining regions. Here, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of large low-recombining (LLR) regions in cultivated populations of pearl millet, an outcrossing diploid African cereal. We examine seven large regions ranging from 5 to 88 Mb and six of them are pericentromeric. These LLR regions exhibit an excess of heterozygotes, a distinctive hallmark of overdominance. They display a tendency toward a higher diversity and a larger ratio of non-synonymous and deleterious variants. We conduct a more in-depth study of the largest 88 Mb region, identified on chromosome 3. Interestingly, haplotypes of this region have been introgressed from wild relatives. Using long read sequencing, we confirm their strong divergence and the presence of inversions across one of them. One of the haplotypes seems to be highly deleterious in the homozygous state. A total of 17% of the cultivated pearl millet genome exhibit a local population structure suggestive of overdominance or possibly pseudo-overdominance. Our empirical results contribute to the accumulation of knowledge, which will enhance our understanding of the potential role of overdominance or pseudo-overdominance in maintaining genetic diversity, particularly in low recombining regions.

 Compound events where droughts end with heavy precipitation can lead to damage to infrastructure, crops and ecosystems that exceed those of an isolated drought or heavy precipitation event due to increased flooding and runoff from the hardened dry ground. Based on regional climate models we show that the occurrence of these compound events (drought ending with one in 100-day precipitation event) during summer in Europe increases by around 35% (+/−22%) for both the mid-century and end-of-century future projections with an intermediate emission scenario compared to present-day.

 Mode waters play a crucial role in ocean heat and carbon storage, as well as in climate variability. Here we reveal a strong relationship between the North Pacific Eastern Subtropical Mode Water (NPESTMW) and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. NPESTMW volume anomalies exhibit significant correlations with the Ocean Niño Index up to nine months in advance. Our analysis identifies two distinct pathways connecting NPESTMW and ENSO development. First, NPESTMW serves as a footprint of the Pacific Meridional Mode, a well-established ENSO precursor. Second, NPESTMW influences tropical Pacific sea surface temperature through the Subtropical Cell. Notably, our findings indicate that stronger NPESTMW volume anomalies are more closely tied to multi-year ENSO events than to single-year development, especially for the La Niña phase. These discoveries offer new insights into the roles of subtropical mode water in shaping ENSO development."

 Three La Niña onset types were identified by the K-means cluster analysis of equatorial sea surface temperature anomaly evolutions during the past 111 years (1910–2020). The first type is characterized by a slow basin-wide transition from a neutral year to La Niña, driven by tropical North Atlantic (TNA) warming, which induced anomalous easterlies in the equatorial western Pacific through atmospheric Kelvin wave responses. The easterly anomalies initiate a cooling by triggering upwelling oceanic Kelvin waves, shoaling the thermocline, and strengthening the westward zonal currents.

 Soil fauna is a crucial component of soil biodiversity, which affects various processes and functions in terrestrial ecosystems. However, few quantitative, large-scale spatially distributional studies have explored the abundance and biomass of soil fauna. In this study, the 95 areas at 19 sites in the Loess Plateau region were surveyed. Numerous individual samples of soil fauna and environmental factors such as climate, soil and vegetation on which soil fauna depended were collected and identified. The results indicate that the soil fauna of the Loess Plateau grassland can be classified into 3 phyla, 10 classes and 23 orders, with an average soil fauna density of about 2 × 104 ind. m−2, and an average biomass of about 18 g m−2. Notably, the soil fauna density and biomass decreased significantly as the latitude increased, and the overall spatial distribution pattern revealed a gradual decrease from southeast to northwest in the Loess Plateau. We found that climatic factors, especially precipitation, primarily drove the spatial distribution of soil fauna density and biomass, contributing 72% and 58%, respectively. Conservatively estimated, the number of soil fauna on the Loess Plateau exceeds 4 × 1015, with the estimated total biomass of 4 × 106 t, equivalent to 2 Mt carbon. In addition, model predictions indicate that soil fauna populations and biomass of grassland in the Loess Plateau increased 27% and 29%, from 2000 to 2022.

 Warm sea surface temperature anomalies in the north tropical Atlantic are conducive to increased intensity and frequency of Atlantic hurricanes. The period 2023-2024 saw two consecutive warm events but with distinct anomaly patterns. Here we use observations and model outputs over the past several decades to determine whether there exists inherent diversity in north tropical Atlantic surface temperature spatial structures and impacts. We find two distinctive modes of variability: a basin-wide mode and a coastal mode, underpinned by differing relationships between air-sea heat flux and sea surface temperature anomalies. The basin-wide mode has a stronger influence on Atlantic hurricane activity due to its more westward and persistent anomaly pattern. Since the 1990s, the well-known impact from El Niño-Southern Oscillation on the north tropical Atlantic is felt through its influence on the basin-wide mode. Our results highlight the importance of distinguishing the two distinctive modes in assessing and predicting their impacts.

Given the widespread use of the high-resolution dataset VHR-REA_IT, produced by downscaling ERA5 reanalysis with CCLM at ~2.2 km over Italy, and the transition from CCLM to ICLM within the scientific communities (as the Consortium for Small-Scale Modelling COSMO and Climate Limited-area Modelling CLM), this work aims to assess the added value of using ICLM at convection-permitting scale over Italy during the recent impactful year 2023. Evaluation results and objective metrics, highlight a reduction in the warm bias of ICLM compared to CCLM with respect to the E-OBS gridded observation dataset, especially during the warmer months. Although CCLM shows a general good performance, ICLM improves the representation of daily accumulated precipitation in spring over territories with a complex orography and reduces the bias of wind speeds. Also, the diurnal cycles are generally improved. The ICLM added value is further proven by the analyses focusing on impactful events (two flooding events, a heatwave and a windstorm) hitting the Emilia-Romagna region during the year 2023.

 A self-organizing map (SOM) was employed to classify extreme precipitation events (EPEs) in Pakistan into six types with distinct characteristics and spatial distributions. Types P1–P3 were concentrated in the southern regions and types P4–P6 were concentrated in the northern regions. We further illuminated the multiscale interaction mechanisms involved in the development of key synoptic systems that generate the six types of EPEs (P1–P6). Cross-scale transfers of kinetic energy (KE) and available potential energy (APE) occurred in P1, resulting in baroclinic and barotropic instability in the basic- and intraseasonal-scale windows. The development of an anticyclonic anomaly over western Russia and the South Asian High (SAH) anticyclone system led to the most intense and protracted EPEs. P2 was characterized by a cyclonic anomaly over western Russia and anticyclonic anomalies over Central Asia and eastern Russia, persisting over local areas in the original and intraseasonal-scale fields to promote the synoptic transient wave train activity. The basic scale being dominant in the baroclinic instability led to the westward shift of the EPEs. The SAH and an active synoptic cyclonic dominated P3, with convergence and diabatic heating, which intensified the EPEs. Although the distributions and driving mechanisms of P4–P6 differed, their energy flows were similar to those of P3, dominated by synoptic-scale spatial transport and diabatic heating.

 Changes in Arctic sea ice have been shown to affect the climatic variability of the Tibetan Plateau (TP), but it remains unclear whether this Arctic-TP link has been stable over the past century. Using multiple reanalysis datasets (1900–2021), we found an interdecadal reversal in the relationship between winter Barents-Kara Sea ice concentration (BKSIC) and TP surface air temperature (TPSAT). In response to BKSIC loss, an out-of-phase pattern of “warm Arctic-cold TP” occurred during 1950–1975 (P1), while an in-phase pattern of “warm Arctic-warm TP” occurred during 1985–2021 (P2). The reversal of the BKSIC-TPSAT link is associated with changes in the position and strength of the subpolar and subtropical jet streams and quasi-stationary Rossby waves. During P1, the TPSAT was influenced by two distinct zonally oriented wave trains, associated with sea ice loss over the Greenland-Barents Kara Seas, the negative phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), and the positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation (AO). The north branch of the wave train propagates eastward along the intensified subpolar jet stream, while the south branch of the wave train originated from the North Atlantic and propagates eastward through the subtropical jet stream into the southern TP. In contrast, during P2, prominent BKSIC loss with positive AMO leads to a weakened subpolar jet stream, which favors the meridional propagation of the wave train into the southern TP. This study highlights the potential role of BKSIC in driving differing TP atmospheric thermal conditions in the context of distinct AMO phases."

Here, we evaluated the aging and neurodegenerative effects of F-53B using the C. elegans model. After exposure to F-53B at 2, 10, and 50 ng/L, C. elegans showed an aging phenomenon as lipofuscin was significantly increased by 48.7–57.5% and locomotion, such as center point speed, was significantly decreased in all exposure groups. F-53B also induced Parkinson’s disease (PD)-like disorders including dyskinesia (incidence: 22.8–27.9%), dopaminergic neuronal damage (neuritic blebbings and broken neurites) and decreased dopamine levels (15.2–28.1%), increased abundance (1.3–1.4 fold) and aggregation of α-synuclein. Inhibition of antioxidant enzymes and disruption of the normal dopamine cycle via promoting DAT-1 were observed in C. elegans after F-53B exposure, consequently contributing to the increased level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Such oxidative stress led to notable mitochondrial damage as gene expression related to mitochondrial morphology and function including pink1, pdr-1, fis1, and djr was significantly suppressed in all exposure groups, which could contribute to the aging and PD-like disorders observed above as ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction were well demonstrated to be important inducers for aging and PD.

Addressing the current issues of low utilization of infrared imagery information and insufficient extraction of domain knowledge, we employ objective techniques to extract convective features related to cloud organization from infrared imagery. These features, along with satellite imagery and historical intensity values, are selected as model inputs. This paper introduces a deep learning model designed for the short‐term prediction of TC intensity in the Northwest Pacific by fusing satellite imagery and convective features (TCISP‐fusion). We developed a spatiotemporal feature extraction module to capture high‐level features from the spatio‐temporal sequences of satellite imagery and convective features. Additionally, we introduced a spatiotemporal feature fusion module to integrate asymmetrically distributed convective features while minimizing information loss during feature extraction. Furthermore, we applied the Laplacian Pyramid Image Fusion algorithm to effectively combine observations from the infrared (IR) and water vapor (WV) channels. This method captures large‐scale cloud system structures and retains small‐scale detailed features, generating high‐contrast fused imagery and reducing the complexity of input data. The TCISP‐fusion model achieves a root mean square error of 10.87 kt for 24‐hr intensity prediction of western North Pacific TCs.

Significant tree mortality can occur years after fire events, but this has received little attention compared to the immediate tree loss during a fire. We overlapped forest cover loss data with burn severity maps in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and quantified the total and delayed forest canopy loss after fires. We found that wildfires resulted in total canopy loss fraction (CLF) of 84%, 53%, and 22% within 3 years in areas burned at high, moderate, and low severity, respectively. The delayed canopy loss accounted for approximately 1/3, 1/2, and 2/3 of the total canopy loss for high, moderate, and low severity burns. Delayed canopy loss was greater in moist and cool areas than in dry and warm areas, likely because tree species in wetter environments were less adapted to survive when fires did occur. Across all forests, delayed CLF doubled as temperature increased from the climatological mean to a hot anomaly and tripled as vapor pressure deficit increased from a wet anomaly to a dry anomaly. Fire impacts on forest ecosystems are likely to intensify under future climate scenarios as wildfires expand into areas that historically experienced infrequent fires. The impacts can also be exacerbated by more frequent compound extreme events, such as droughts, heatwaves, and fires. These findings highlight the urgent need for targeted forest management strategies, particularly in mesic forests, to mitigate future fire impacts."

Refining glacier projections and sources of uncertainty thus supports climate adaptation and mitigation. Here we explicitly quantify the impact of internal climate variability and climate data bias adjustment methods on regional and global glacier projections through 2100 for various emissions scenarios. Uncertainty from internal climate variability is comparable to climate model structural uncertainty (i.e., arising from physical representations and parameter settings) in the coming decades at the regional level, but is not a major source of uncertainty in centennial global glacier projections. Bias adjustment options (method and time period) moderately impact projections at regional and glacier scales, but have a smaller impact (∼2% of global glacier mass at 2100, relative to 2020) at global scales. In some regions, the uncertainty due to internal climate variability is larger than climate model structural uncertainty for the entirety of the 21st century, and bias adjustment options can nearly double the regional uncertainty by 2100. At the glacier scale, bias adjustments can lead to differences in projected decadal and centennial mass loss of up to 30%, although these greatest differences are associated with the smallest (<1 km2) glaciers. Overall, internal climate variability and climate data bias adjustment methods are important to consider, especially in regional applications, to better estimate uncertainty in future sea‐level rise and water resources availability."

This study uses field observations and dynamic modeling to investigate drivers of groundwater variability and to project flooding risks from emergent groundwater in Imperial Beach, California. Hourly groundwater table data from four monitoring wells (2021–2024) reveal distinct aquifer behaviors across soil types. In transmissive coastal sandy soils, groundwater levels are dominated by ocean tides, with secondary contributions from non‐tidal sea level variability and seasonal recharge. In this setting, we calibrated an empirical groundwater model to observations, and forced the model with regional SLR scenarios. We project that groundwater emergence along the low‐lying coastal road will begin by the 2060s under intermediate SLR trajectories, and escalate to near‐daily flooding by 2100. Over 20% of San Diego County's coastline shares similar transmissive sandy geology and thus similar flooding risk. Results underscore the urgency of integrating groundwater hazards into coastal resilience planning, as current adaptation strategies in Imperial Beach—focused on surface flooding—are insufficient to address infrastructure vulnerabilities from below. This study provides a transferable framework for assessing groundwater‐driven flooding in transmissive coastal aquifers, where SLR‐induced groundwater rise threatens critical infrastructure decades before permanent inundation."

However, few studies thoroughly investigated the distribution and driving factors of global CEIH, even though a considerable amount of cropland has extended to the highlands over recent decades. To investigate CEIH, we employed spatial statistics, elevation spectrum analysis, and terrain gradient methods to quantify spatio‐temporal patterns and elevation changes in global cropland distribution from 1995 to 2020. We then explored the key driving factors of CEIH at different scales using spatial regression models and multiscale geo‐weighted regression model. The results revealed that global average cropland elevation increased from 422.782 m in 1995 to 427.321 m in 2020, representing a 4.539 m net increase. CEIH was reflected on both global and continental scales in all continents except South America during the study period. Furthermore, CEIH showed an intense agglomeration pattern. Human activities and cropland reclamation rate emerged as the primary underlying driving factors of CEIH. The encroachment of development on lowland agricultural areas forced CEIH, which was the core of this phenomenon. Vertical cropland expansion was predominantly concentrated in ecologically vulnerable highlands and ecological transition zones. The driving factors of CEIH exhibited spatial and multiscale heterogeneity. These findings provided a scientific basis for formulating targeted cropland conservation policies by highlighting the differences in cropland management performance across various levels of government globally."

 Electron avalanche breakdown plays a pivotal role in determining the efficiency and reliability of semiconductors and insulators in micro-nanoelectronics and power systems. However, it still remains challenging to understand and control this transient non-equilibrium process. Here, we propose and demonstrate an atomic-scale electron avalanche breakdown model to investigate the dynamic behaviors of excited electrons under extremely high electric fields in various dielectrics ranging from simple oxides to perovskites. Using high-throughput calculations, we establish the relationship maps between ionization energy, bond energy, electron mean free path and breakdown strength, and then excavate their mathematical expressions. On this basis, a high-entropy strategy in BaTiO3-based dielectrics with controllable lattice distortion is well designed to regulate the electron avalanche process, which successfully achieves a ~ 250% improvement in the breakdown strength by preventing electrons from acquiring sufficient energy. The atomic-scale understanding of electron avalanche breakdown process provides more refined guidance for atom/defect engineering to break the universal rule of inverse relation between breakdown strength and permittivity in dielectrics.

 Uncovering the dynamic structures of water at the electrode-solution interface is crucial for various electrocatalysis processes, where water acts as a proton and electron source. However, precisely controlling the state of water on complex interfaces remains challenging. Inspired by the metalloproteins in natural enzymes, we herein demonstrate that the hydrophilic sulfo-oxygen bridging between Co and Ru sites (Cos-SO-Ru) optimizes interfacial water structure via a favorable hydrogen-bond network, promoting hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions. Mechanistic studies reveal that the stereoscopic sulfo-oxygen bridges enhance the connectivity of hydrogen-bond network to promote the proton transfer process via repelling cations from the electrode surface. Furthermore, electron donating Co sites reduce the surface oxophilicity of Ru to optimize the adsorption-desorption behaviors of hydroxyl, governing the timely refreshed Ru sites to enhance catalytic performances. Such bioinspired active sites offer a different pathway for the precise design of interfacial water structure to improve electrocatalysis.

 Despite significant advances in membrane technology, achieving efficient separation in organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) remains a major challenge in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, particularly when dealing with multicomponent molecular mixtures. To address this, in this study, we develop a biphasic column for organic solvent membrane extraction, which consists of closely packed micron-sized water droplets covered by sub-nanometer-thick ion-ligand complexes that serve as size-exclusive membranes. Molecular mixtures dissolved in an organic solvent can be selectively extracted into the droplets through the interfacial complexes based on their sizes, while the solvent flows through the micron-scale interstices between the droplets. This solute-solvent dual pathway design minimizes resistance in solvent convection, resulting in high productivity, while simultaneously achieving a high separation factor through the monodisperse nanopores of the interfacial complexes. Using aluminum ion-carboxylate terminated polydimethylsiloxane complexes as a representative, the column demonstrates a controllable, high separation factor of 600 with a productivity of 1100 L·m−2·hour−1·bar−1 in cyclohexane, significantly outperforming conventional membrane OSN.

 Long-distance microbial transport via dust events is projected to intensify globally. However, survival mechanisms of air- and dust-borne bacteria and their contribution to global processes remain poorly understood. In this study, we characterized Bacillus species from transitional season dust storms, previously identified as a significant component of the bioactive community of the dust microbiome. Our results demonstrated substantial growth and surface-associated biofilm formation diversification, linked to niche adaptation within heterogeneous dust particles. Most dust isolates formed biofilms while showing varying preferences for media composition under standard laboratory conditions, extreme temperatures, and low humidity. Sterile dust stimulated biofilm formation, growth, and matrix gene expression of B. subtilis, leading to robust biofilm development in key related dust isolates. This effect surpassed that of inorganic, synthetic dust, representing a role for organic substrates from decayed dust-community members. Overall, these findings offer direct evidence that biofilm formation serves as an adaptive mechanism in the unique habitat of dust particles, suggesting that niche adaptation may play a role in microbial survival across dust storms.

 Source apportionment of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) provides scientific basis for the prevention of ozone (O3) and particulate matter pollution, while bias exists in the receptor model based on the measured concentration. We conducted online measurement of hourly ambient concentrations for multiple VOCs species in January and July 2023 in Lianyungang, a city with fast growing industry in east China, and five major sources of VOCs were identified with an improved application of the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model by considering photochemical losses and formation potential of secondary aerosols (SOAP) and O3 (OFP). For January and July, the total VOCs (TVOC) concentrations were measured at 23.7 ± 10.8 and 12.0 ± 7.5 ppbv, and the averaged consumed VOCs due to photochemical losses in daytime reached 3.12 and 3.08 ppb, respectively. The concentrations were generally lower than those in Chinese mega cities. As the important emission from industrial sources, Oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) were found to occupy a significant position in the concentration structure of TVOCs and photochemical losses in Lianyungang. Inclusion of photochemical losses avoided underestimation of contribution from solvent usage and overestimation of vehicle emissions in summer. There was a significant difference between source contributions based on concentrations and environmental impacts (SOAP in winter and OFP in summer). For the latter, coal burning was identified as the most important source in January, and industrial emissions and solvent usage in July. Indicated by the backward trajectories, local emissions were the dominant contributor to the VOCs pollution, mainly from the large ports and industrial parks, while industrial emissions from nearby provinces (Shandong and Anhui) were also important.

 Bacteria are important components of bioaerosols as a potential source of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in the atmosphere. Previous studies have shown that bacteria can be activated as CCN, but the reported CCN forming potential can vary greatly among different studies and for different types of bacteria. In particular, the effect of atmospheric aging on the CCN activity of bacteria under atmospheric relevant conditions remains largely unknown. In this study, the CCN activity of airborne Escherichia coli (E. coli) was determined and the effects of biological aging and atmospheric exposures were examined by chamber simulation experiments. Results showed that the aerosolized E. coli particles displayed a bimodal size distribution, with a larger particle mode composed of whole cells and a smaller mode composed of bacterial fragments that were present at much higher number concentrations. The calculated hygroscopicity parameter κ was 0.08 ± 0.01 for the cell, and 0.16 ± 0.01 for the fragments in the presence of purified air. The CCN activity and hygroscopicity of E. coli varied significantly under different experimental conditions, with the magnitude of the change depending on the degree of aging, the atmospheric conditions and the type of pollutant gas. An even larger increase in κ was observed under actual ambient air compared with any single exposure. Our study indicates that the CCN activity of bioaerosols previously measured in the laboratory may not be applicable to real atmospheric conditions because the effects of atmospheric aging were not taken into account. Due to the sensitivity to environmental conditions, the cloud nucleating abilities of bioaerosols may be underestimated. Therefore, atmospheric interactions need to be considered in assessing the contribution of bioaerosols to the atmospheric CCN population and hence the impact on indirect climate forcing."

ARs occurred only 8 % of the time at Ny-Ålesund but contributed to about 42 % of the total precipitation amount with a high liquid mass fraction (72 %). Cyclones occurred 20 % of the time and were associated with 39 % of the precipitation, mainly in solid form (62 %). Frontal systems play a minor role in the precipitation amount at Ny-Ålesund.  Extreme events, i.e., days with daily precipitation sums above the 98th percentile, contribute 18 % to the total precipitation amount. All of these events are related to enhanced water vapor transport, often in the form of ARs and in combination with fronts and a high liquid mass fraction. Liquid precipitation in winter is mainly connected to ARs.

Shutler,Decadal and spatially complete global surface chlorophyll-a data record from satellite and BGC-Argo observations,"Chlorophyll-a is routinely monitored using ocean colour satellites, however, these data records have gaps. Here we present a methodology to provide a spatially and temporally complete chlorophyll-a record, using Biogeochemical Argo floats as a constraint on wintertime chlorophyll-a, and a statistical kriging approach to fill cloud gaps. Thereby, providing a complete record at monthly 0.25° resolution between 1997 and 2023, consistent to the underlying climate data record. 
 Decadal-scale satellite-based climate data records of chlorophyll-a (chl-a), an essential climate variable, are now readily available at high accuracy and precision. These data are being extensively used for research and, increasingly, for operational services. However, these observations rely on availability of sunlight and the satellite sensor being able to view the ocean, so there are gaps in data due to the presence of clouds and more widely during the polar winter. This is an issue when spatially complete data are needed for global climate studies, or as inputs to machine learning methods and for data assimilation. Whilst addressing cloud cover is well studied, methodologies to overcome missing data due to the polar winter has received little attention and simple approaches to overcome these gaps can lead to unrealistic values. Biogeochemical Argo (BGC-Argo) floats have widely been deployed, and they represent an opportunity to address these gaps. We present an approach that combines BGC-Argo data and a satellite chl-a climate data record to produce a spatially and temporally complete, global monthly chl-a record between 1997 and 2023 at 0.25° spatial resolution. Clouds gaps were filled using an established spatial kriging approach. Polar wintertime chl-a were reconstructed using relative changes between the wintertime BGC-Argo chl-a, and the previous autumntime or next springtime satellite observations, for individual hemispheres. Uncertainties were calculated on a per-pixel basis to retain the underlying uncertainty fields in the climate data record and were modified to account for the uncertainties related to the gap filling. The seasonal cycles in the resulting polar data are consistent with light availability. Clear interannual and inter-hemisphere variability in the wintertime chl-a were observed. Independent assessment of solely the gap filled wintertime chl-a estimates against in situ data (N = 204 total) indicates that the accuracy and precision of the underlying satellite data, a key component of a climate data record, are maintained. The 25 year global and spatially complete chl-a data, that are consistent with the underlying climate data record can be downloaded from Zenodo (Ford et al., 2025b)."

Hansen,An Accurate 10 m Annual Crop Map Product of Maize and Soybean Across the United States,"We developed the first annual, 10-m spatial resolution maize and soybean maps over the US from 2019 to 2022. Evaluated by ground data collected over a stratified random sample, our maps achieved > 95 % overall accuracy consistently. Our analysis suggested that mixed pixels could be substantially reduced by the increased spatial resolution from 30 m to 10 m. Our maps can support research subjects such as forecasting crop yield, analyzing agricultural-related greenhouse gas emissions, etc. 
 High-resolution crop maps over large spatial extents are fundamental to many agricultural applications; however, generating high-quality crop maps consistently across space and time remains a challenge. In this study, we improved a workflow for crop mapping and developed the first openly available, annual, 10-m spatial resolution maize and soybean maps over the Contiguous United States (CONUS) from 2019 to 2022, available at the Global Land Analysis and Discovery at the University of Maryland (https://glad.umd.edu/projects/mapping-crops-10-m-resolution-united-states). We obtained all available Sentinel-2 surface reflectance data between May and October for every year, applied quality assurance, corrected the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) effects, and generated 10-day analysis ready data (ARD) composites. We then derived multi-temporal metrics from the 10-day ARD as training features for the national-scale wall-to-wall mapping. We implemented a stratified, two-stage cluster sampling, and then conducted annual field surveys and collected ground data. Utilizing the training data with Sentinel-2 multi-temporal metrics and topographic factors, we trained random forest models generalized for annual maize and soybean classification separately. Validated using field data from the two-stage cluster sample, our annual maps achieved consistent overall accuracies (OA) greater than 95 % with standard errors of less than 1 %. User’s accuracies (UAs) and producer’s accuracies (PAs) for maize were higher than 91 % and 84 % across the years, and UAs and PAs for soybean were greater than 88 % and 82 %, respectively. To illustrate the substantial improvement of the 10-m map over existing datasets, e.g., the 30-m Cropland Data Layer (CDL), we aggregated the 10-m maps to 30-m spatial resolution and quantified the amount of 30-m mixed pixels that can be reduced at field, regional, and national levels. The counties with the most maize and soybean production in Iowa, Illinois and Nebraska had the lowest reduction in mixed pixels, ranging from 1 % to 10 %, whereas southern counties had a higher reduction in mixed pixels. Overall, the median percentages of mixed maize and soybean pixels reduction across all counties were 14 % and 16 %, respectively. With more Sentinel-2-like data available from continuous observations and incoming satellite missions, we anticipate that 10-m crop maps will greatly benefit long-term monitoring for agricultural practices from the field to global scales. The dataset is also available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28934993.v1 (Li et al., 2025)."

However, the molecular mechanism of phosphate (P) immobilization on CCCFe remains largely unknown. In this study, batch experiments were conducted to investigate the immobilization mechanisms of P on CCCFe with low and high Fe loadings (CCCFel vs CCCFeh) using P K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy with surface-sensitive total electron yield (P-XANESTEY) and bulk-sensitive fluorescence yield (P-XANESFLY) modes. Results indicated that the high Fe loading inhibited calcite formation but favored vaterite production in the CCC and enhanced its P retention capacity. Hydroxyapatite (HAP) dominated over ferrihydrite-associated P (Fe–P) in the bulk of P sorbed on the CCCFeh, but amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) dominated over HAP for the CCC, suggesting Fe-induced transformation of the ACP to the HAP. Furthermore, the P-XANESTEY analysis indicated brushite primarily formed on the surface of the P sorbed on the CCCFeh at high P loading. Consistently, the spherical aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy analysis directly revealed ferrihydrite coating on the CCC and the presence of Ca–P and Fe–P associations. This study provides new molecular-level insights into Fe-tuned depth-dependent transformation of P on the CCC, thus benefiting P management in the CCC-enriched environmental settings."

Engineered nonsewered sanitation (NSS) technologies can meet treatment requirements without sewers, but their relative sustainability varies across potential deployment sites. Here, we characterize the costs and carbon intensity (CI) of three emerging NSS technologies, two community reinvented toilets (CRTs) and one Omni Processor (OP), across 77 countries, identify sustainability performance typologies, and map typology prevalence in countries across the globe. Locality-specific factors such as wages, diet, and material costs drive regional variability in NSS costs by up to 15-fold and CI up to 2-fold within technologies. Across all three NSS technologies and all scenarios evaluated, costs ranged from 0.01 to 0.36 USD·capita–1·day–1 and CIs ranged from 8 to 269 kg CO2 eq·capita–1·year–1. Low-cost, low-CI typologies are predominantly in countries with lower human development indices (HDI 2–4), demonstrating alignment between the sanitation need and the NSS opportunity space. Ultimately, the intent of this work is not to imply one-size-fits-all solutions for individual countries; by elucidating key sustainability drivers and defining typologies, this work can support early-stage decision-making for NSS technology research, development, and deployment."

This study systematically evaluates airborne distribution dynamics, surface deposition patterns, and human exposure risks associated with meperfluthrin-based mosquito-repellent incenses (disc, electric liquid, and electric mat) under the conditions of open and closed windows. The highest concentration of meperfluthrin derived from disc incense in the respiratory zone (0.0223 mg/m3) was 2–3-fold higher than other electric incenses (0.0075–0.0078 mg/m3). More than 73.8% of the active ingredient of mosquito-repellent incense can be transferred into the water system through cleaning activities. Quantitative risk assessment indicated an acceptable level of risk (risk quotients <1) for all products under recommended conditions of use. However, biomonitoring revealed a ubiquitous urinary presence of the meperfluthrin metabolite trans-DCCA in 100% of residential samples (0.1373–3.3027 μg/g creatinine, n = 19), suggesting bioaccumulation potential. Acute exposure experiments in mice revealed that the disc incense induced a 23-fold elevation in serum trans-DCCA levels compared to electric incenses, in addition to a significant increase in the levels of hepatotoxicity biomarkers (alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase).

Herein, 12-week-old Long-Evans rats were exposed to smoldering eucalyptus smoke with concentrations ranging from 3.52–23.7 mg/m3 for 7 total days (1 h/day) over a 10-day period, aligning with sperm maturation. An additional subset of rats was exposed to the filtered fraction of the lowest concentration, removing particulate matter from the smoke emission. At ∼24 h following the final exposure, the percentage of sperm with progressive tracking was reduced with whole smoke exposure (11 mg/m3). This reduction was accompanied by a decrease in the average path velocity (VAP) of sperm. While these effects were lost at the 3.52 mg/m3 concentration, interestingly, filtration of the particulate matter from this exposure reduced progressive motility and nearly all measures of sperm kinetics including VAP, straight line velocity (VSL), and the amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH). Data from this study provides evidence that acute exposure to eucalyptus smoke during a sensitive window of the sperm lifecycle (maturation) impairs sperm motility, an effect that may be attributed to the volatile phase of eucalyptus combustion."

Although such a world is unrealistic, addressing this question would reveal the role tropical cyclones (TCs) play in modulating the climate system. In this study, we begin to address this question by introducing a novel algorithm for reducing TC activity in TC‐permitting global climate models (GCMs) through suppression of wind‐induced surface heat exchange (WISHE) at grid points where TC‐like conditions are detected. This algorithm, abbreviated as “SWISHE,” was implemented in a suite of GCM simulations developed by NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory and compared to a control suite of simulations with no perturbations. Application of SWISHE resulted in a model‐mean 44% reduction of TC frequency compared to control simulations, with TCs of hurricane‐strength reduced by approximately 90%. Aggregate analysis of TCs reveals that TCs in the SWISHE simulations are weaker, as peak 10‐m horizontal wind speeds decrease by a model‐mean of 3.9 m s−1 and minimum sea‐level pressures increase by a model‐mean of 4.7 hPa. Composite analysis is used to confirm that SWISHE effectively suppressed latent heat fluxes in grid cells with TC‐like conditions. The results presented herein are intended to provide a first step in establishing methodology to understand upscale impacts of TCs on the climate system."

 Realizing universal fault-tolerant quantum computation is a key goal in quantum information science [1, 2, 3, 4]. By encoding quantum information into logical qubits utilizing quantum error correcting codes, physical errors can be detected and corrected, enabling substantial reduction in logical error rates [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. However, the set of logical operations that can be easily implemented on such encoded qubits is often constrained [12, 1], necessitating the use of special resource states known as ‘magic states’ [13] to implement universal, classically hard circuits [14]. A key method to prepare high-fidelity magic states is to perform ‘distillation’, creating them from multiple lower fidelity inputs [15, 13]. Here we present the experimental realization of magic state distillation with logical qubits on a neutral-atom quantum computer. Our approach makes use of a dynamically reconfigurable architecture [16, 8] to encode and perform quantum operations on many logical qubits in parallel. We demonstrate the distillation of magic states encoded in d  =  3 and d  =  5 color codes, observing improvements of the logical fidelity of the output magic states compared to the input logical magic states. These experiments demonstrate a key building block of universal fault-tolerant quantum computation, and represent an important step towards large-scale logical quantum processors."

 Gut microbiota influence the antitumour efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade1–6, but the mechanisms of action have not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that a new strain of the bacterial genus Hominenteromicrobium (designated YB328) isolated from the faeces of patients who responded to programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) blockade augmented antitumour responses in mice. YB328 activated tumour-specific CD8+ T cells through the stimulation of CD103+CD11b− conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), which, following exposure in the gut, migrated to the tumour microenvironment. Mice showed improved antitumour efficacy of PD-1 blockade when treated with faecal transplants from non-responder patients supplemented with YB238. This result suggests that YB328 could function in a dominant manner. YB328-activated CD103+CD11b− cDCs showed prolonged engagement with tumour-specific CD8+ T cells and promoted PD-1 expression in these cells. Moreover, YB238-augmented antitumour efficacy of PD-1 blockade treatment was observed in multiple mouse models of cancer. Patients with elevated YB328 abundance had increased infiltration of CD103+CD11b− cDCs in tumours and had a favourable response to PD-1 blockade therapy in various cancer types. We propose that gut microbiota enhance antitumour immunity by accelerating the maturation and migration of CD103+CD11b− cDCs to increase the number of CD8+ T cells that respond to diverse tumour antigens. A newly identified bacterial strain (YB328) isolated from the faeces of patients who responded to immune checkpoint blockade therapies can promote antitumour immunity through the activation of tumour-specific CD8+ T cells."

Here, the authors use antiCRISPR to enhance genome-wide CRISPR screening in Drosophila and generate higher-resolution maps of cell fitness, toxin, and drug-resistance. 
 CRISPR screens enable systematic, scalable genotype-to-phenotype mapping. We previously developed a CRISPR screening method for Drosophila melanogaster and mosquito cell lines using plasmid transfection and site-specific integration to introduce single guide (sgRNA) libraries. The method relies on weak sgRNA promoters to avoid early CRISPR-Cas9 activity causing discrepancies between genome edits and integrated sgRNAs. To address this issue and utilize higher strength sgRNA expression, we introduce a method to co-transfect a plasmid expressing anti-CRISPR protein to suppress early CRISPR-Cas9 activity which we term “IntAC” (integrase with anti-CRISPR). IntAC dramatically improves precision-recall of fitness genes across the genome, allowing us to generate the most comprehensive list of cell fitness genes yet assembled for Drosophila. Drosophila fitness genes show strong correlation with human fitness genes and underscore the effects of paralogs on gene essentiality. We also perform a resistance screen to proaerolysin, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-(GPI)-binding pore-forming toxin, retrieving 18/23 expected and one previously uncharacterized GPI synthesis gene. We also demonstrate that an IntAC sublibrary enables precise positive selection of a transporter under solute overload. IntAC represents a straightforward enhancement to existing Drosophila CRISPR screening methods, dramatically increasing accuracy, and might also be broadly applicable to virus-free CRISPR screens in other cell and species types.

 An inflammatory process may increase the risk of arrhythmias after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). In this single-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial we investigated the efficacy of colchicine to reduce a composite of new-onset atrial fibrillation or atrioventricular conduction disturbances requiring the implantation of a permanent pacemaker at 30 days after TAVR. Between September 21, 2021 and April 25, 2024, 120 patients with aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR (mean age 80.6 ± 5 years, 64% male) were randomly allocated to treatment with colchicine (n = 60) or placebo (n = 60). The trial was prematurely stopped due to a higher rate of stroke in the experimental group in a pre-specified interim analysis (5 [8.3%] versus 0 at maximum available follow-up, p = 0.022). In the intention-to-treat population, the primary endpoint occurred in 6 patients (10%) in the colchicine group and in 15 patients (25%) in the placebo group (risk-difference −15.0%, 95% CI −28.3 to −1.7, p = 0.031). The prespecified imaging endpoint, subclinical leaflet thrombosis, was detected in 13 of 48 patients (27%) in the colchicine group versus 26 of 48 patients (54%) in the placebo group (risk difference −27.1%. 95% CI −46.0% to −8.2%, p = 0.007). Here, we show that periprocedural treatment with colchicine may reduce the incidence of new-onset arrhythmias and subclinical leaflet thrombosis after TAVR. However, given the premature termination of the trial due to an unexpected increase in the stroke rate among patients treated with colchicine, confirmatory trials are warranted to corroborate the effect of anti-inflammatory treatment on the incidence of arrhythmias and subclinical leaflet thrombosis after TAVR.

 Catalysts featuring multiple active sites hold significant potential for CO2 photoconversion to multi-carbon products. However, multi-metal-site catalysts typically face challenges with low yields and selectivity for ethylene production, with a lack of definitive design guidelines. Here we show that Bader charge can serve as a critical descriptor for delineating the structure–activity relationship of kesterite-like nanosheets in the reduction of CO2 to ethylene. We propose the Bader-Regulate-Performance principle — apposite Bader charge can provide a moderate energy barrier for intermediate adsorption and C-C coupling simultaneously, thus promoting the performance for ethylene generation. Among the predicted multi-metal-site nanosheets, the Cu2ZnSnS4, with the appropriate Bader charge, achieves a high ethylene yield of 25.16 µmol g−1 h−1 with electron selectivity of 72.4% under visible light irradiation, surpassing those of reported photocatalysts under similar catalytic conditions.

Here, the authors engineer semiconductor coated upconversion nanohybrids for the synergistic actions of ultrasound and near-infrared light that promote drug penetration and reactive oxygen species-mediated disruption of Candida albicans biofilms. 
 Fungal biofilms, as self-produced extracellular polymeric substances that resist antifungal agents and immune defense, represent a major cause of treatment failure and recurrent infections. Therefore, it is of great importance to eradicate fungal biofilms to achieve efficient therapy. This study develops a synergistic reactive oxygen species (ROS)-enhanced strategy to eradicate Candida albicans biofilms by designing ultrasound-light dual-responsive nanohybrids (UCNP@CR). The system integrates thulium-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) with carbon nitride-coated surfaces (g-C3N4) and polypyridine ruthenium complex (Ru) photosensitizers. In treatment, the dense fungal biofilm can be effectively loosened under ultrasound stimulation while ultrasound simultaneously triggers ROS production of UCNP@CR, collectively promoting irreversible destruction of biofilm and inward penetration of photosensitizer. Moreover, UCNP@CR exhibits strong fungal adhesion, while its g-C3N4-mediated enhanced metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) process of Ru under near-infrared light irradiation amplifies ROS generation, which leads to efficient eradication of fungal biofilms. As in vivo experimental evidence, UCNP@CR exhibits excellent antifungal efficacy in treating fungal biofilm-infected wounds in immunosuppressed male mice under ultrasound-light stimulation. These findings establish the ultrasound-assisted, ROS-enhanced synergistic strategy as a promising approach against fungal biofilm infections and provide diverse perspective for managing other biofilm-related infectious diseases.

 Half-Heusler compounds are promising thermoelectric materials for high-temperature applications, yet their performance is limited by high lattice thermal conductivity. Here, we present an alternative approach to synthesize ZrNiSn-based half-Heusler compounds with hierarchical architectures across multiple length scales. By utilizing short-duration mechanical alloying to produce nonequilibrium precursors, followed by reactive sintering, we enable precise control over phase composition and microstructural features. This approach results in multi-scale architectures comprising interstitial defects, grain boundaries, nanoprecipitates, and pores, enabling strong phonon scattering. The optimized Zr0.75Hf0.25NiSn0.99Sb0.01 alloy exhibits a lattice thermal conductivity as low as 1.9 W m−1 K−1 and a high power factor of 50 µW cm−1 K−2, yielding an impressive dimensionless figure of merit (zT) of 1.33 at 873 K. This performance surpasses that of ZrNiSn-based compounds synthesized via conventional methods such as arc melting and solid-state reaction. Our method, distinguished from conventional melting synthesis approaches through its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and scalability, provides a versatile framework for achieving efficient hierarchical phonon scattering while preserving high carrier mobility in half-Heusler compounds and highlights the potential of reactive sintering for advancing thermoelectric materials.

 Arousal is fundamental for affective experience and, together with valence, defines the core affective space. Precise brain models of affective arousal are lacking, leading to continuing debates of whether the neural systems generalize across valence domains and are separable from those underlying autonomic arousal or wakefulness. Here, we combine naturalistic fMRI with predictive modeling to develop a brain affective arousal signature (BAAS, discovery-validation design, n = 60, 36). We demonstrate its (1) sensitivity and generalizability across mental processes, valence, and stimulation modality and (2) neural distinction from autonomic arousal and wakefulness (24 studies, n = 868). Affective arousal is encoded in distributed cortical-subcortical (e.g., prefrontal, periaqueductal gray) systems with local similarities in thalamo-amygdala-insula systems between affective and autonomous arousal. We demonstrate application of the BAAS to improve specificity of established valence-specific neuromarkers. Our study provides a biologically plausible model for affective arousal that aligns with the affective space and has a high application potential.

Now a study explores the potential benefits of solar installations in open-pit mines around the world. 
 Climate action requires rapid scaling of solar energy while minimizing land conflicts. Solar farms often compete with agriculture and ecosystems, but repurposing abandoned mines could offer a solution. We assess global open-pit mining sites as potential solar hubs, analysing their technical feasibility and deployment timelines under diverse future scenarios. Using a residual artificial neural network and energy demand projections, we find that these disturbed lands could host solar installations covering around 48,000 km2—ten times the global solar footprint in 2018. Their total generation potential (4,764 TWh yr−1) could meet projected 2050 global electricity needs. While Mediterranean countries show the highest readiness for mine-to-solar conversions, African nations lag despite having optimal sunlight owing to infrastructure and policy barriers. Our scenario analysis reveals that deployment timing and scale depend heavily on economic growth, clean energy costs and fossil fuel prices—with aggressive transitions requiring solar capacity exceeding current mine areas by 106%. This study provides a road map for strategically aligning solar expansion with post-mining land revitalization.

 Despite advances in climate modeling, simulating the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) remains challenging due to its spatiotemporal diversity and complexity. To address this, we build upon existing model hierarchies to develop a new unified modeling platform, which provides practical, scalable, and accurate tools for advancing ENSO research. Within this framework, we introduce a dual-core ENSO model (DCM) that integrates two widely used ENSO modeling approaches: a linear stochastic model confined to the equator and a nonlinear intermediate model extending off-equator. The stochastic model ensures computational efficiency and statistical accuracy. It captures essential ENSO characteristics and reproduces the observed non-Gaussian statistics. Meanwhile, the nonlinear model assimilates pseudo-observations from the stochastic model while resolving key air-sea interactions, such as oceanic feedback balances and spatial patterns of sea surface temperature anomalies during El Niño peaks. The DCM effectively captures the realistic dynamical and statistical features of the ENSO diversity and complexity. The computational efficiency of the DCM also facilitates a rapid generation of extended ENSO datasets, overcoming observational limitations."

Decreased microbial- and plant-derived carbon in these fractions may relate to reduced arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi diversity in degraded patches, because fungal necromass carbon correlated more strongly with diversity decline than bacterial necromass. Grassland patches decrease arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi diversity and glomalin-related soil proteins content but stimulate their proportion, the cementation of glomalin-related soil proteins protect microbial-derived carbon from degradation, increasing its accumulation in both carbon fractions.

 Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), a perennial legume forage crop, is valued for its high yield and quality. However, its survival during winter can be affected by several factors, and its mortality significantly impacts alfalfa production, necessitating timely and spatially detailed monitoring. This study aims to propose a framework for estimating alfalfa stem density using satellite imagery and machine learning (ML) algorithms, which can lead to winter mortality detection early in the spring and provide a better understanding of potential total dry matter. Three ML models—support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB)—were applied to Harmonized Landsat Sentinel (Landsat only, which is HLSL30) and Sentinel-2 datasets, accessed via the Google Earth Engine (GEE) Python API. Two scenarios were evaluated: 1) single-date data, capturing satellite images within a 3-day time window to the date of field sample measurement, and 2) time-series data, in which three satellite images were collected for the measurements during the first growing cycle. Both classification and regression models were used in both scenarios to estimate and classify alfalfa stem density. ML Classification models categorized stem density into four groups (bare, low-density, medium-density, and high-density), achieving an accuracy of up to 85 % using Sentinel-2 data and 84 % using HLSL30 data. The results also indicated that alfalfa stem density can be estimated with an error of ∼ ±6-9 stems/foot2 (1 foot = 30.48 cm) using ML regression models.

 Multi-view reconstruction of real-world scenes has been an important and challenging task. Although methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have made significant progress in rendering quality, there are still some limitations regarding the fidelity of geometric structures. To address this challenge, we propose a novel 3D reconstruction approach within the 3DGS framework, integrating lidar point clouds and multi-view images, named LiDGS, which achieves high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction by introducing high-precision geometric a priori information and multiple geometric constraints from lidar point clouds, while guaranteeing efficient and accurate scene rendering. Specifically, we adopt an adaptive checkerboard sampling strategy and multi-hypothesis joint view selection (ACMP) for whole-image depth propagation, generating a high −precision dense depth map that provides continuous and accurate depth prior constraints for Gaussian optimization. Then, we design an adaptive Gaussian densification strategy, which effectively guides the geometric structure of the 3D scene through geometric anchors and adaptively adjusts the number and volume of Gaussians to more finely characterize the geometry of the object surface. Finally, this paper introduces a depth regularization method to correct the depth estimation of each Gaussian, ensuring the consistency of depth information from different viewpoints, which, in turn, improves the reconstruction quality. The experimental results show that the method achieves superior performance in both the new view synthesis task and the 3D reconstruction task, outperforming other classical methods.

This study introduces CarbonFiberStone (CFS), a novel lightweight construction material, and assesses its carbon footprint in a specific building application. CFS is defined as a millimeter-thin bio-based carbon fiber fabric bonded to compression-resistant stone slabs using an adhesive. CFS is extremely resistant to compression and tension. The resulting stone powder from the stone cutting process is used for enhanced rock weathering. The wall element presented here incorporates a layer of biochar for insulation purposes. Using life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis, we compare five CFS-based building blocks with two conventional reinforced concrete blocks in single and multi-story residential buildings. The results show that CFS walls achieve a net carbon negative balance of −56.86–65.32 kg CO2eq m−2, sequestering 0.10–0.15 t CO2 per square meter of living space at similar costs to conventional construction with reinforced concrete. These results show that CFS has the potential to become a viable, sustainable alternative to conventional building materials and thus has the potential to make a significant contribution to the 1.5 °C target of the Paris Agreement."

We focused on the supply of three ES in an Alpine river, namely habitat provision, recreational activities, and hydroelectricity production from run-of-the-river (RoR) power plants. We applied an integrated hydrological, hydraulic and habitat modeling approach to quantify the effects of climate change (CC) on these services, based on the outcomes of four regional climate models. The paper investigated the effects of water use policies such as the introduction of prescriptions for environmental flow (EF) under the same CC models. We observed that CC significantly affects the river suitability for the supply of ES at the catchment scale, while the introduction of EF releases are relevant at a more local scales (several reaches). Under future scenarios, simulated increasing abstractions for hydroelectricity production from RoR power plants have a stronger effect on white-water rafting and a relatively smaller effect on fish habitat. Quantifying the potential effects of CC and of different strategies of river flow management under these scenarios is a promising approach to support the design of long-term water resources management strategies at catchment and local level."

However, dynamical models for the Indian Ocean often exhibit significant biases compared to historic tide gauge (TG) based sea level records, highlighting the need for improved methods. To address this gap, we applied a long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning network to reconstruct hourly storm surges across 29 TG locations along the Indian Ocean coastlines for the period 1979–2021. Our results demonstrate the robust performance of the LSTM model, which outperforms existing global surge reconstructions by realistically capturing storm surges associated with tropical cyclones and extreme conditions. We extended this approach to generate future projections of ESL for the Indian Ocean, which has been lacking for the densely populated coastline. The ESL projections are generated by integrating storm surges predicted via LSTM with bias-corrected Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) predictors, tide data from hydrodynamic models, and mean sea level (MSL) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 6th Assessment Report (AR6). The findings reveal that future ESL changes will be predominantly driven by MSL rise, with contributions from tides and storm surges accounting for approximately 10%.

Using machine learning, we filled data gaps and introduced a new approach to analyze EC trends. Our findings reveal a significant decline in EC due to stricter pollution controls, though this slowed after 2020. This study provides a versatile framework for addressing data gaps and supports strategies to reduce urban air pollution and its climate impacts. 
 Ground-based measurements of elemental carbon (EC) – classified under thermal–optical methods and considered a surrogate for black carbon – are essential for assessing air quality and evaluating climate impacts. However, data gaps caused by technical challenges impede comprehensive analyses of long-term trends. This study proposed an ensemble learning modeling method to address these challenges. The model used readily accessible ground observation air pollutant data as proxies for EC-related tracers, along with meteorological parameters, to enhance prediction accuracy. It integrated outputs from Gradient Boosting Regression Trees, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and random forest models, combining them through ridge regression to produce robust predictions. We applied this approach to reconstruct hourly EC concentrations from 2013–2023 for four cities in eastern China, filling 45 %–79 % of missing data and improving prediction performance by 8 %–17 % compared to individual models. Over the 11-year period, EC exhibited an overall decline (−0.20 to -0.14µgm-3a-1), with a more significant decrease from 2013–2020 (−0.24 to -0.15µgm-3a-1). During this time, the average EC concentration in the four cities dropped from 3.26 to 1.59 µg m−3, followed by a noticeable slowdown in the rate of decline from 2020–2023 (−0.12 to -0.04µgm-3a-1). Additionally, a fixed emission approximation method based on ensemble learning was proposed to quantitatively analyze the drivers of long-term EC trends. The analysis revealed that anthropogenic emission controls were the predominant contributors, accounting for approximately 92 % of the changes in EC trends from 2013–2020.  However, their influence weakened post-2020, contributing approximately 80 %. These findings highlighted that while China's Clean Air Actions implemented since 2013 have substantially reduced black carbon concentrations, sustained and enhanced strategies are still necessary to further mitigate black carbon pollution."

However, most O3 formation analysis based on the box model (OBM) does not include any OVOC constraint. To access the interference of OVOCs with O3 simulation, this study presents results from a field campaign and OBM analysis. Our results indicate that no OVOC constraint in the OBM can lead to overestimation of OVOCs, free radicals, and O3. 
 Oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs), an important subgroup of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), are emitted directly or formed secondarily through photochemical processes. They play a crucial role in tropospheric chemistry as ozone (O3) precursors. However, due to measurement limitations, the influence of OVOCs on O3 formation has often been underestimated. In this study, 74 VOCs (including 18 OVOCs) were measured at five representative stations (urban, suburban, industrial, upwind, and downwind stations) in Zibo, an industrial city in the North China Plain. The VOCs level in Zibo (44.6 ± 20.9 × 10−9) is in the upper-middle range (> 32 × 10−9) compared to previous studies conducted in most Chinese cities, with OVOCs contributing for 30.0 %–37.8 %. The average O3 formation potential in Zibo is 410.4 ± 197.2 µg m−3, with OVOCs being the dominant contributor (31.5 %–55.9 %). An observation-based model (OBM) was used to access the contributions of chemical production (RNetProd) and emissions/transport (REmis&Trans) to individual OVOCs. Daytime (08:00–18:00 LT) RNetProd is highest at the urban site (5.9 × 10−9 h−1), while nighttime REmis&Trans is most negative at the industrial site (0.76 × 10−9 h−1). Simulations without OVOC constraint overestimate OVOCs (42.1 %–126.5 %) and key free radicals (e.g., hydroperoxy radicals (HO2, 5.3 %–20.4 %) and organic peroxy radicals (RO2, 6.6 %–35.1 %)), leading to a 1.8 %–11.9 % O3 overestimation. This overestimation causes an underestimation of hydroxyl radicals (OH) (1.8 %–20.9 %) and atmospheric oxidizing capacity (3.5 %–12.5 %). These findings emphasize the importance of comprehensive OVOC measurements to constrain numerical models, especially in regions with dense anthropogenic emissions, to better reproduce atmospheric photochemistry, and to formulate more effective air pollution control strategies."

 The role of the Saharan Air Layer (SAL) in Cabo Verde cyclogenesis remains uncertain. Here, we investigate the inhibiting factors leading to the failed cyclogenesis of mesoscale convective system (MCS) Pierre Henri observed during two flights of the Clouds-Atmospheric Dynamics-Dust Interactions in West Africa (CADDIWA) campaign. We use CADDIWA data and a convection-permitting simulation run with the Meso-NH model. We show that the African easterly wave in which MCS Pierre Henri is embedded forms a region of cyclonic recirculation that is relatively protected from lateral intrusions, called a marsupial pouch, which keeps the SAL away from the MCS. By contrast, a dusty, dry, and warm air layer between 0.8 and 2 km altitude, called the Saharan trade wind layer (STWL), penetrates into the convective core of MCS Pierre Henri, increasing the convective inhibition (CIN) area and contributing up to 40 % of the CIN area during the MCS' mature phase. The cold pools produced by convection also increase the CIN area and contribute up to 50 % of this area after the MCS' intense phase. Upper-tropospheric dry air, with relative humidity below 15 % between 7 and 11 km altitude, gradually penetrates into the 150 km circle around the MCS, reaching 18 % of the area during its dissipation phase and preventing the MCS' anvil expansion. The inhibiting roles of the STWL, cold pools, and upper-tropospheric dry air in leading the cyclogenesis fail to provide new insights into the complex dynamics of cyclogenesis in the Cabo Verde region and challenge the existing model of the SAL."

The key contribution is the identification of critical hydrodynamic processes – ice transport, heat advection, and shear-driven turbulence production – that influence lake thermal structure and ice cover and explain the superior performance of 3D lake models to their 1D counterparts. 
 The Laurentian Great Lakes significantly influence the climate of the Midwest and Northeast United States due to their vast thermal inertia, moisture source potential, and complex heat and moisture flux dynamics. This study presents a newly developed coupled lake–ice–atmosphere (CLIAv1) modeling system for the Great Lakes by coupling the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Unified Weather Research and Forecasting (NU-WRF) regional climate model (RCM) with the three-dimensional (3D) Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) and investigates the impact of coupled dynamics on simulations of the Great Lakes' winter climate. By integrating 3D lake hydrodynamics, CLIAv1 demonstrates superior performance in reproducing observed lake surface temperatures (LSTs), ice cover distribution, and the vertical thermal structure of the Great Lakes compared to the NU-WRF model coupled with the default 1D Lake Ice Snow and Sediment Simulator (LISSS). CLIAv1 also enhances the simulation of over-lake atmospheric conditions, including air temperature, wind speed, and sensible and latent heat fluxes, underscoring the importance of resolving complex lake dynamics for reliable regional Earth system projections. More importantly, the key contribution of this study is the identification of critical physical processes that influence lake thermal structure and ice cover – processes that are missed by 1D lake models but effectively resolved by 3D lake models. Through process-oriented numerical experiments, we identify key 3D hydrodynamic processes – ice transport, heat advection, and shear production in turbulence – that explain the superiority of 3D lake models to 1D lake models, particularly in cold season performance and lake–atmosphere interactions. Critically, all three of these processes are dynamically linked to water currents – spatially and temporally evolving flow fields that are structurally absent in 1D models. This study aims to advance our understanding of the physical mechanisms that underlie the fundamental differences between 3D and 1D lake models in simulating key hydrodynamic processes during the winter season, and it offers generalized insights that are not constrained by specific model configurations."

This study presents DECIPHeR-GW v1, which links surface and groundwater systems to improve predictions of streamflow and groundwater levels. Tested across England and Wales, DECIPHeR-GW shows high accuracy, especially in southeast England, making it a valuable tool for large-scale water management. 
 Groundwater is a crucial part of the hydrologic cycle and the largest accessible freshwater source for humans and ecosystems. However, most hydrological models lack explicit representation of surface–groundwater interactions, leading to poor prediction performance in groundwater-dominated catchments. This study presents DECIPHeR-GW v1 (Dynamic fluxEs and ConnectIvity for Predictions of HydRology and GroundWater), a new surface–groundwater hydrological model that couples a model based on hydrological response units (HRUs) and a two-dimensional gridded groundwater model. Using a two-way coupling method, the groundwater model component receives recharge from HRUs, simulates surface–groundwater interactions, and returns groundwater levels and groundwater discharge to HRUs, where river routing is then performed. Depending on the storage capacity of the surface water model component and the position of the modelled groundwater level, three scenarios are developed to derive recharge and capture surface–groundwater interactions dynamically. Our coupled model was set up at 1 km spatial resolution for the groundwater model, and the average size of the surface water HRUs was 0.31 km2. The coupled model was calibrated and evaluated against daily flow time series from 669 catchments and groundwater level data from 1804 wells across England and Wales. The model provides streamflow simulation with a median Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) of 0.83 across varying hydro-climates, such as wetter catchments with a maximum mean annual rainfall of 3577 mm yr−1 in the west and drier catchments with a minimum of 562 mm yr−1 in the east of Great Britain, as well as diverse hydrogeological conditions including chalk, sandstone, and limestone. Higher KGE values are found in particular for the drier chalk catchments in southeast England, where the average KGE for streamflow increased from 0.49 in the benchmark DECIPHeR model to 0.7. Furthermore, our model reproduces temporal patterns of the groundwater level time series, with more than half of the wells achieving a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.6 or higher when comparing simulations to observations. Simulating 51 years of daily data for the largest catchment, the Thames at the Kingston River basin (9948 km2), takes approximately 17 h on a standard CPU, facilitating multiple simulations for model calibration and sensitive analysis. Overall, this new DECIPHeR-GW model demonstrates enhanced accuracy and computational efficiency in reproducing streamflow and groundwater levels, making it a valuable tool for addressing water resources and management issues over large domains."

However, most existing magnetopause models cannot capture this time-dependent process, and numerical simulations demand significant computational resources. We have developed the first time-dependent 3D model capable of showing these shield changes. It is significantly more precise and performs nearly instant computations. 
 The interaction between the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere is a critical area of research in space weather and space physics. Accurate determination of the magnetopause position is essential for understanding magnetospheric dynamics. While numerous magnetopause models have been developed over past decades, most are time-independent, limiting their ability to elucidate the dynamic movement of the magnetopause under varying solar wind conditions. This study introduces the first time-dependent three-dimensional magnetopause model based on quasi-elastodynamic theory, named the POS (Position–Oscillation–Surface wave) model. Unlike existing time-independent models, the POS model physically reflects the dynamic responses of magnetopause position and shape to time-varying solar wind conditions. The predictive accuracy of the POS model was evaluated using 38 887 observed magnetopause-crossing events. The model achieved a root-mean-square error of 0.774 Earth radii (RE, representing a 17.9 % improvement over five widely used magnetopause models. Notably, the POS model demonstrated superior accuracy under highly disturbed solar wind conditions (22.1 % better) and in higher-latitude regions (27.0 % better) and flank regions (33.3 % better) of the magnetopause. The POS model's remarkable accuracy, concise formulation, and fast computational speed enhance our ability to predict magnetopause position and shape in real time. This advancement is significant for understanding the physical mechanisms of space weather phenomena and improving the accuracy of space weather forecasts. Furthermore, this model may provide new insights and methodologies for constructing magnetopause models for other planets."

However, models including chemistry are very slow. Hence, any computation speedup of such models is important for understanding the role of atmospheric chemistry within the Earth system. In this study we analyzed and optimized the time step for chemistry calculations. Our results show that atmospheric models could be run notably faster without any loss in accuracy. 
 Numerical integration of multiphase chemical kinetics in atmospheric models is challenging. The underlying system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is stiff and thus difficult to solve. Rosenbrock solvers are a popular choice for such tasks. These solvers provide the desired stability and accuracy of results at an affordable yet large computational cost. The latter is crucially dependent on the efficiency of the step size control. Our analysis indicates that the local error, which is the key factor for the step size selection, is often overestimated, leading to very small substeps. In this study, we optimized the first-order step size controller most commonly employed in Rosenbrock solvers. Furthermore, we compared its efficiency to a second-order step size controller. We assessed the performance of the controllers in both a box and a global model for very stiff ODEs. Significant reductions in the computation time were accomplished with only marginal deviations in the results compared to the standard first-order controller. This was achieved not only for gas-phase chemistry but also for the more complex aqueous-phase chemistry in cloud droplets and deliquescent aerosols. Depending on the selected chemical mechanism, significant improvements were already achieved by simply adjusting heuristic parameters of the default controller. However, especially for the global model, the best results were achieved with the second-order controller, which reduced the number of function evaluations by 43 %, 27 % and 13 % for gas-phase, cloud and aerosol chemistry, respectively. The overall computational time was reduced by over 11 % while requiring only minimal adjustments to the original code. Analysis of a 1-year integration period showed that with the second-order controller, the deviations from the reference simulation stay below 1 % for the main tropospheric oxidants. The results presented here show the possibility of more efficient atmospheric chemistry simulations without compromising accuracy."

In this study, we conducted a high-throughput assessment of antibiotic resistance development in the model strain Escherichia coli K12 after 50-day exposure to 15 aliphatic DBPs commonly found in drinking water against 8 different classes of antibiotics. The results showed that most treated bacteria developed resistance to cell wall-targeting antibiotics such as ampicillin and fosfomycin, with resistance levels increasing by 1.16- to 6.39-fold, higher than for other classes of antibiotics. Multidrug resistance was observed in the tribromoacetonitrile (TBAN), bromonitromethane (BNM), and dibromonitromethane (DBNM) groups. DBPs exposure induced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and damaged the bacterial cell membrane. Genomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed mutations and differential expression in genes related to cell wall synthesis and structure, indicating that exposure to DBPs will influence the bacterial cell wall. Nontargeted ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) analysis further confirmed the cell wall structure alteration by the increased proportion of noncanonical d-amino acids in peptidoglycan, the major component of the cell wall, potentially explaining the observed resistance to cell wall-targeting antibiotics. Collectively, this study highlights the risk of aliphatic DBPs-induced antibiotic resistance, likely driven by alterations in the bacterial cell wall."

To accomplish this, hydrogen use has been suggested in many industries that currently rely on fossil fuels. Yet, the emissions intensity of hydrogen depends on how it is produced and distributed. Additionally, it is unclear whether hydrogen use leads to a reduction in GHG emissions compared to alternative decarbonization options such as electrification with renewables. Here, we systematically compare the decarbonisation potential of supplying hydrogen to the United Kingdom from a wide range of global supply chains. We do this by assessing 37,000 configurations of the hydrogen supply chain from primary energy production through to end-use. We find that imports of green hydrogen production are unlikely to be compatible with the UK Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard. The maximum mitigation potential is achieved when electrification is prioritized, and hydrogen used only for applications where electrification is not viable. This leads to a reduction of up to 280 Mt CO2e/a across all sectors considered in the UK. In the short term, use of domestic green hydrogen infrastructure should focus on displacing existing gray hydrogen use."

Continuous alterations in the composition of plastisphere microbiomes were observed during incubation, and the successions of plastisphere microbiomes were significantly influenced by the colonization environment, followed by the polymer type and incubation time. The assembly of plastisphere microbiomes was dominated by stochastic processes; however, determinism contributed more to the assembly of plastisphere bacterial communities than to fungal communities, suggesting that the filtering effects of MPs on bacteria were stronger than those on fungi. The microbial communities in plastispheres exhibited networks of lower complexity and stability, as well as lower functional diversity, than the networks within bulk soils. Bacterial communities played a greater role in plastisphere microbial network formation and MP degradation than fungal communities.

The inherent heterogeneity of these systems, along with solute exchange between high- and low-permeability regions, results in anomalous transport, including early solute arrivals and prolonged residence times. A key challenge in studying these processes is the inability to directly observe the subsurface transport mechanisms. To overcome this, we employed etched dolostone cores with controlled geometry in reactive transport experiments and applied positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to directly visualize solute transport. Our findings demonstrate that flow rate significantly influences solute exchange between the conduit and the fracture/matrix. PET imaging and reactive transport experiments reveal distinct solute and mineral precipitate distributions under low- and high-inertia flow conditions. Numerical simulations further highlight the role of fracture aperture in modulating solute exchange and show how higher flow rates induce 3D recirculation zones that enhance local reactivity. Tracer breakthrough curve inversions indicate that increased exchange can produce multipeaked breakthrough curves.

Here, we assessed intestinal ARGs and virulence factor genes (VFGs) during earthworm development (egg, juvenile, and adult) and their influence on soil ARGs and potential pathogens. Our results showed that ARGs and potential pathogens were widespread and varied within earthworm guts at different growth stages. Earthworm guts harbored significantly (p < 0.05) fewer high-risk ARGs than soil, indicating potential roles of earthworms in soil ARG mitigation. Conversely, potential pathogens were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in guts than in soil. We further found that earthworms across life stages increased soil potential pathogens and reinforced ARG-mobile genetic element (MGE)-pathogen linkages in the soil ecosystem. ARG spread in earthworm guts relied more on vertical transmission than horizontal gene transfer (HGT).

In these single-compound enrichment cultures, DCNB isomers were reduced to the corresponding DCA. Each DCA isomer was stoichiometrically dechlorinated to the corresponding monochloroaniline (CA) isomers. Further dechlorination of CA to aniline was noted. The reduction of DCNB to DCA was sustained by known fermenters and possibly Desulfitobacterium, while Dehalobacter was clearly responsible for the dechlorination of DCAs.

Abundance of As-methylating microorganisms in the periphyton increases by 2.1-fold after bicarbonate addition. Members of phototrophs are predominantly responsible for regulating the stability of the periphytic microbiome, of which photoautotrophs (e.g., Oscillatoriales) initiate carbon fixation and constitute a major portion of As-methylating populations. These phototrophs further offer requisite organic substrates such as polysaccharides for heterotrophic bacteria (e.g., Chitinophagales) that in return foster the growth of the periphytic community, while these taxa simultaneously detoxify As through biomethylation to secure their ecological niches in periphyton. Such a symbiotic metabolism between phototrophs and heterotrophs facilitates carbon sequestration and shapes the functional community, collaboratively determining methylated As production in paddy soils.

Copper-based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), such as Cu(II)/peroxymonosulfate (PMS), have been utilized for phosphonate degradation via Cu(III)-mediated oxidation. However, Cu(I) (the crucial intermediate for Cu(III) generation) suffers from sluggish Cu(II) reduction. Herein, we synthesized a copper single-atom catalyst supported on zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) to achieve superior PMS activation and phosphonate degradation via an in situ-formed Zr-phosphonate surface complex. Cu–ZrO2/PMS achieved nearly 100% degradation of 1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid (HEDP) and 98% conversion to phosphate (PO43–) within 30 min at pH 9, demonstrating high performance and resistance to potential matrix interferences. Experimental results combined with theoretical calculations demonstrated the synergy between Cu and Zr sites, where Cu functioned as PMS activation and Cu(III) generation sites and Zr served as favorable HEDP coordination sites for the formation of complexes. This coordination increased the electron density of Cu sites, facilitating Cu(II) reduction to Cu(I) and subsequent production of Cu(III) via further reaction with PMS.

To accelerate BiCRS deployment, it is crucial to quantify the costs of CCS integration, particularly for small- and medium-scale biorefineries that are representative of early-stage deployment. Existing studies tend to focus on plant sizes that are orders-of-magnitude larger than early-stage installations, possibly underestimating CCS costs for small-to-medium biorefineries. We show that the capture, transport, and storage costs to maximize CO2 removal from a 526 dry tonne per day (tpd) biomass gasification plant (largest existing size) could be 13–47% higher than costs for a typical modeled plant size (2000 dry tpd). The higher cost estimates are driven by less favorable economies of scale and realistic assumptions about the availability of affordable CO2 transport infrastructure with both drivers broadly applicable to other BiCRS technologies. Compliance and voluntary carbon markets could incentivize biorefinery CCS, but both carry a high degree of uncertainty. These findings highlight that sufficient and reliable financial mechanisms would be essential to unlocking the full CO2 removal potential of biorefineries and facilitating BiCRS scale-up."

Commercial Δ8-THC and Δ10-THC distillates were found to have variable purity, with the Δ10-THC distillate comprising roughly one-third of Δ8-THC. The addition of a commercial terpene oil mixture (rich in d-limonene, β-caryophyllene, β-myrcene, and others) at 0%, 7.5%, and 15% by mass to the Δ8-THC and Δ10-THC distillates significantly increases emissions of carbonyls up to 9-fold, but not those of cannabinoid oxidation products. On average, 6 ± 1 mg of aerosol was produced per puff, which did not significantly vary with added terpenes. Molecular analysis confirmed that a majority of the carbonyl products originate from the chemical oxidation of terpenes during vaping. The most abundantly observed carbonyls were acetone, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, and terpene-derived carbonyls. We concluded that high terpene content in CEC products gives rise to more carbonyl emissions in the aerosol due to terpene oxidation, which has adverse implications for inhalation toxicology in an indoor environment."

The detailed dispersion of Lamb waves remains vague due to lack of data, but also to simplifications inherent in existing models. Here, we investigate the pressure perturbations induced by the 2022 Hunga‐Tonga eruption at both global and regional barometric arrays. After correction of the influence of wind and temperature, the group velocity dispersion curves, measured by tracking energy arrival times across different frequencies, show a decreasing trend with frequency which is superimposed by two low‐velocity bands. Regarding the synthetic results, we interpret these low‐velocity bands as the coupling effect between Lamb waves in the lower atmosphere and gravity or acoustic waves in the upper atmosphere, offering profound understandings of surface‐to‐space observations for hazard management and mitigation after extreme atmospheric events."

Typically, these quantities are calculated at a monthly resolution, which misses potentially important high‐frequency temporal variability. Here, we calculated sea‐air CO2 flux at a 3‐hourly resolution using a 10‐year mooring data set (2011–2020) from the central California coastal upwelling region. We identified a significant flux of CO2 from the ocean to the atmosphere due to a positive correlation between seawater pCO2 and wind speed at timescales of hours to days, particularly during the late spring and early summer upwelling season. Accounting for this variability changes the region from a net sink to a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere. These findings imply that CO2 fluxes computed from monthly‐resolution data may miss important shorter‐term variability that contributes to a net outgassing of CO2 from the ocean."

Previous studies reported that electrons penetrate more frequently, deeply, and faster than protons of similar energies, but underlying mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we compare heavy‐ion behavior with electrons and protons to further identify the underlying mechanisms. Using Van Allen Probes data, we show that electron deep penetration occurs most frequently and deeply, followed by O+ ions, then He+ ions, and finally protons. Most particle deep penetrations occur within several hours. Superposed epoch analysis shows that prior to deep penetration, electrons have the steepest phase space density radial gradients, followed by heavy ions and then protons for the same μ and K. Our study suggests that a combination of two or more mechanisms, such as convection electric field and plasma wave‐induced scattering, may be needed to fully explain particle deep penetration."

Despite these fluctuations, the global average emitted thermal power consistently exceeds absorbed solar power, indicating a net energy loss. Assuming no significant seasonal variation in emitted power, we estimate an internal heat flux of 0.078 ± 0.018 W/m2 by analyzing the energy budget over one orbital period. The combination of internal heat and radiant energies indicates substantial global and hemispheric imbalances, with excesses or deficits exceeding 85% of emitted power at the hemispheric scale.

Parker,CMIP6 Representation of Declining Sea Ice and Arctic Cyclones in the Current Climate,"The Arctic climate system is changing rapidly with important implications in the Arctic and beyond. The interaction between the sea ice and Arctic cyclones makes it an important topic to be understood in the warming climate. We analyzed an ensemble of Coupled Multimodel Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) model simulations from 1985 to 2014 to determine model skill in depicting Arctic cyclones and their relationship with sea ice. A comprehensive climatology of Arctic cyclones and sea ice concentrations (SIC) was produced and compared to the ERA5 reanalysis product. The models reproduced the observed sea ice spatial patterns and trend well. However, the models struggled to capture the concurrent patterns and trends in Arctic cyclone characteristics that were evident in the reanalysis data. The models underestimated local cyclogenesis in the Arctic, which led to an overall underestimation of Arctic cyclone counts. Lead/lag analysis of ERA5 data suggests that reduced sea ice in the warm season can drive increased cyclone counts in the following cold season, which then reduces SIC in the next warm season in a feedback cycle that appears to be missing from the CMIP6 models. The results also revealed deviations between CMIP6 and ERA5 cyclone intensities. The magnitude and sign of the intensity differences varied based on model resolution, surface roughness parameterization, and skill in the representation of cyclogenesis location. This work highlights the need to improve sea ice‐atmosphere interactions and the representation of synoptic systems in the next generation of global models."

In this study, we reconstruct flood extents for 78 damaging events in eastern North Carolina between 1996 and 2020 using high‐resolution geospatial data and address‐level National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) records. We train random forest models on NFIP‐based labeled flood presence and absence data and a suite of geospatial predictors. Then, we predict the probability of flood damage at every 30 m grid cell within our model domain. Our models achieve an average Area Under the Curve of 0.76 and outperform flood extent estimates from process‐based and remote sensing models when evaluated against NFIP data for six events. We find that approximately 90,000 (2.3%) buildings in our study area flooded at least once, of which over 20,000 (0.53%) flooded more than once. Our estimate is more than double the number of buildings that filed NFIP claims between 1996 and 2020. Furthermore, 43% of flooded buildings are located outside the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Special Flood Hazard Area. Our results illustrate that flood exposure, especially repetitive exposure, is much more widespread than previously recognized. By generating a comprehensive record of past flood extents using address‐level observations of damage, we create a first‐of‐its‐kind geospatial database that can be used to identify locations of repetitive flooding. This represents a crucial first step in examining the dynamic relationships between flood exposure, vulnerability, and risk."

Here, authors analyse whole-exome sequencing data from various cancer cohorts, finding that treatment-resistant tumors shift toward neutral evolution, which correlates with worse prognosis, and monitoring this shift may guide treatment decisions. 
 Tumor evolution is shaped by selective pressures imposed by physiological factors as the tumor naturally progresses to colonize local and distant tissues, as well as by therapy. However, the distinction between these two types of pressures and their impact on tumor evolution remain elusive, mainly, due to extensive intra-tumor heterogeneity. To disentangle the effects of these selective pressures, we analyze data from diverse cohorts of patients, of both treated and untreated cancers. We find that, despite the wide variation across patients, the selection strength on tumor genomes in individual patients is stable and largely unaffected by tumor progression in the primary settings, with some cancer-specific signatures detectable in the progression to metastases. However, we identify a nearly universal shift toward neutral evolution in tumors that resist treatment and demonstrate that this regime is associated with worse prognosis. We validate these findings on both published and original datasets. We suggest that monitoring the selection regime during cancer treatment can assist clinical decision-making in many cases.

By disrupting bacterial succinate production, identified mutations steer immunity toward harmful Th17 responses instead of protective Th1, worsening disease. 
 Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) pathogens, remains a global health threat. While bacterial genetic adaptations during host infection are poorly understood, phase variation in genomic homopolymeric tracts (HT) may drive pathogenicity evolution. Here, we demonstrate that M. bovis exploits HT insertion mutations in the fumarate reductase-encoding frd operon to subvert host immunometabolism. In macrophages, wild-type M. bovis secretes FRD-catalyzed succinate, stabilizing hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) to drive glycolytic reprogramming and IL-1β production. This activates IL-1R-dependent Th1 immunity, restraining bacterial replication. Conversely, M. bovis frd HT insertion mutants impair succinate secretion, suppressing HIF-1α/IL-1β signaling and redirecting immunity toward pathogenic Th17 responses that promote neutrophil infiltration and tissue necrosis. Mice infection models reveal that M. bovis frd mutants exhibit enhanced pathogenicity, with higher pulmonary bacterial burdens. IL-1R blockade phenocopies frd HT insertion mutation effects, exacerbating lung pathology. Crucially, conserved frd HT polymorphisms in clinical M. tb isolates suggest shared immune evasion strategies across MTBC pathogens. Our work uncovers the bacterial gene phase variation mechanism of hijacking the succinate/HIF-1α/IL-1β axis to operate host immunity, providing a framework for targeting host metabolic checkpoints in TB therapy.

 The nature of lead zirconate, the historical antiferroelectric material, has recently been challenged. In PbZrO3 epitaxial films, thickness reduction engenders competition among antiferroelectric, ferrielectric and ferroelectric phases. All studies so far on PbZrO3 films have utilized commercially-available oxide single crystals with large compressive lattice mismatch, causing the films to undergo strain relaxation. First-principles calculations have predicted that tensile strain can stabilize antiferroelectricity down to the nanometre scale. Here we use tensile strain imposed by artificial substrates of LaLuO3 to stabilize a pure antiferroelectric phase in PbZrO3. Sharp double hysteresis loops of polarization vs electric field show zero remanent polarization, and polar displacement maps reveal the characteristic up-up-down-down antipolar pattern down to 9 nanometre film thicknesses. Moreover, the electron beam can move this antipolar pattern through the nucleation and annihilation of translational boundaries. These results highlight the critical role of coherent epitaxial strain in the phase stability of PbZrO3.

Here, based on the excellent biocompatibility and distinctive metabolic ability of natural anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) to dissimilate sulfate into sulfide, we construct in situ-biosynthesized ferrous sulfide nanoparticle-SRB (FeS@SRB) biohybrid to enhance tumor-targeted therapy. Interestingly, SRB acts as both a biosynthesis factory and active tumor-targeted delivery vehicles. Our systematic studies reveal that FeS@SRB has excellent biosafety and tumor targeting capabilities, achieving over 50% tumor delivery efficiency in female mice post-intravenous injection, which is 17 times higher than that of conventional chemically-synthesized FeS@BSA nanoparticles. Upon near-infrared laser irradiation, FeS@SRB hybrids exhibit synergistic photothermal-chemodynamic effect, amplifying oxidative stress to trigger tumor cells ferroptosis and apoptosis, thereby effectively suppressing both subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor growth. This SRB-based therapeutic strategy expands research into tumor-targeting platforms and the biosynthesis of metal sulfide nanoparticles for enhanced tumor therapy. Anaerobic bacteria-mediated tumor therapy has potential but is hindered by complex manufacturing processes, impaired targeting efficiency and side effects. Here, authors develop non-pathogenic anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria for in situ biosynthesis of ferrous sulfide nanoparticles for tumor-targeted therapy."

 The nucleocapsid N is one of four structural proteins of the coronaviruses. Its essential role in genome encapsidation makes it a critical therapeutic target for COVID-19 and related diseases. However, the inherent disorder of full-length N hampers its structural analysis. Here, we describe a stepwise method using viral-derived RNAs to stabilize SARS-CoV-2 N for EM analysis. We identify pieces of RNA from the SARS-CoV-2 genome that promote the formation of structurally homogeneous N dimers, intermediates of assembly, and filamentous capsid-like structures. Building on these results, we engineer a symmetric RNA to stabilize N protein dimers, the building block of high-order assemblies, for EM studies. We combine domain-specific monoclonal antibodies against N with chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry to validate the spatial arrangement of the N domains within the dimer. Additionally, our cryo-EM analysis reveals novel antigenic sites on the N protein. Our findings provide insights into N protein´s architectural and antigenic principles, which can guide design of pan-coronavirus therapeutics.

 The spinal cord is essential for processing sensory information and regulating autonomic functions, such as bladder control, which is critical for urinary continence and voiding. Understanding how the spinal cord represents bladder pressure can provide valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying bladder control and contribute to developing better therapies for bladder dysfunction. However, measuring neural activity in the human spinal cord is notoriously challenging due to its small size and the surrounding bony and fascial enclosures, limiting the effectiveness of traditional neuroimaging techniques. Functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) is a minimally invasive, emerging modality that overcomes these barriers, offering high sensitivity, spatial coverage, and spatiotemporal resolution for studying neural dynamics. Here, we combine fUSI with urodynamically controlled bladder filling and emptying to examine hemodynamic responses in the human spinal cord during one cycle of micturition. Using intravesical bladder pressure recordings, we identify spinal cord regions with hemodynamic signals that strongly correlate with bladder pressure. Furthermore, a linear support vector machine regression model (SVM-r) trained on the fUSI power Doppler signal reveals relevant spinal cord regions and accurately reconstructs bladder pressure changes. Our findings provide evidence of bladder pressure-responsive regions in the spinal cord, where hemodynamic signals strongly correlate with bladder pressure.

 North American glaciers experienced accelerated mass loss over the last decade, yet the degree to which albedo decline drove this mass loss remains uncertain. We use daily summer glacier surface albedo averaged by decade (2000 − 2009 and 2010 − 2019) derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer to investigate how snow and ice darkening influenced glacier mass loss for 25 of the largest and most heavily glaciated regions in North America. Here we show that glacier albedo respectively decreased by 0.019 ± 0.019 and 0.018 ± 0.009 in western North America and in the Canadian Arctic. This decrease in albedo coincides with increased geodetically derived glacier mass loss within these regions (R2 = 0.76, R2 = 0.63; p < 0.01). Modelled surface energy balance and melt rates, forced by European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5th Generation Land reanalysis and regional decadal averages of albedo, indicate that 31% of increased melt rate in Western North America and 41% of increased melt rate in the Canadian Arctic can be attributed to albedo decline. Projected increases in air temperature this century will further reduce glacier albedo, and the resulting positive feedback will further accelerate glacier mass loss.

 Mantle wedge metasomatism is a widespread phenomenon in subduction zones. However, details of early melt generation and the extent of metasomatic processes is unclear. Here we document two distinct types of adakitic felsic rocks within the mantle wedge of the North Qaidam ultrahigh-pressure metamorphic belt. These field observations provide direct evidence for extensive mantle wedge metasomatism. Zircon and apatite U-Pb dating indicates a rapid exhumation and cooling of the subducted plate. Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic analyses, combined with forward phase equilibrium modeling of partial melting, suggest that these adakitic veins formed either through partial melting of a single continental crustal source or by mixing of melts derived from both oceanic and continental crusts. These findings underscore the critical role of melts derived from both oceanic and continental crusts in the growth and evolution of continental crust during collisional orogenic events.

 Accurate and timely mapping of landslides after the event (e.g., earthquake) is crucial for effective rescue operations and comprehensive disaster assessment. While optical images are often obstructed by clouds and fog, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can identify landslides independently of weather conditions. In this study, we propose a deep learning method which exploits a morphological model (DLM) to achieve accurate landslide identification using only a post-event single-temporal polarimetric SAR image. The SAR scattering mechanisms and polarimetric characteristics of various ground objects are thoroughly analyzed to select optimal polarimetric parameters for deep learning. To accurately map landslide shapes and extract boundaries, we introduce a Majority Voting mechanism and a morphological optimization model. We have used one quad-pol ALOS-2 image for landslide mapping and achieved an overall accuracy of 95.24 % with the proposed method. Additionally, considering the limited availability of quad-pol SAR data, we have employed dual-pol ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1 data to assess the method's usability with dual-pol data. The dual-pol ALOS-2 image achieved an overall accuracy of 89.78 %, while Sentinel-1 image effectively captured the general landslide shape with an overall accuracy of 76.32 %. This demonstrates the high applicability of the proposed method for landslide mapping using a single post-event polarimetric SAR image, enhancing the timeliness of SAR-based landslide mapping and improving emergency response and post-disaster rescue capabilities."

 The accurate extraction and mapping of cage aquaculture are of substantial significance to the sustainable development of bay ecosystems but remain challenging due to diverse aquaculture practices in changing bay environments. Existing methods rely primarily on complex classifiers; however, their generalization capabilities are limited. To address this challenge, we developed a novel classification method called Otsu-UNet by integrating the Otsu algorithm with the U-shaped Network method.

 Alpine zones, located above the treeline in high mountain areas, are highly sensitive to global warming. Topography modulates land surface energy, mass and momentum fluxes and thus can largely influence vegetation growth under a warming climate. However, little is known about the topographical effects on vegetation changes during recent decades, especially in alpine vegetation at the global scale. Here we utilize 30 m spatial resolution Landsat imagery to quantify trends in vegetation greenness and vegetated areas during 1984–2023 in global alpine ecosystems and quantify the effects of topography on vegetation changes. Our results reveal that more than 99 % of the global alpine zones show concurrent significant (p < 0.05) vegetation greening and increasing vegetated areas. Yet, the effects of topography on the two vegetation metrics diverge in 85.49 % of the regions where the magnitude of the rate of vegetation greening decreases with higher elevation whereas the expansion rate of vegetated areas is faster with higher elevations. Moreover, vegetation dynamics also covary with the slope aspect, with polar-facing slopes experiencing higher trend magnitude in vegetation greenness (72.59 %) and vegetated areas (64.50 %) compared to the equatorial-facing slopes. Our findings provide a unified assessment of global alpine vegetation dynamics and highlight the complex impacts of topographic factors on alpine ecosystems under global climate change."

 Landsat series data (Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), and Landsat-9 OLI2) hold significant potential for detecting temporal changes of underwater terrain in optically shallow waters resulting from earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, waves, and human activities due to their extensive time series (nearly 40 years) and medium-spatial-resolution (30 m). However, different Landsat series images have different band sets and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) which may impact the consistency of the bathymetry inversion results of optimization-based bathymetry inversion models. Therefore, this study initially quantitatively evaluated the consistency of Landsat series data-derived bathymetry data over the South China Sea, which has a notable distribution of coral islands. The results of 12 images indicated that the root mean square error values of the estimated water depth are generally less than 4 m at Qilian Yu and less than 2 m at Dongsha Dao at depths shallower than 10 m. At depths greater than 10 m, OLI/OLI2 obtained higher accuracy in water depth inversion than did TM/ETM+. The inter-comparison results and temporal results of different geomorphic zones indicated that the Landsat series-derived water depth values in the reef flat and shallow lagoon, where water depth is shallower than 10 m, exhibit high consistency. However, because TM and ETM+ have lower SNRs, for deep lagoons and fore reefs where water depth is greater than 10 m and the substrate is dark, the OLI/OLI2- and TM/ETM+-derived water depth values substantially differ. Then, Landsat series data were applied to detect bathymetric changes in the Nanwei Dao. The temporal results of Nanwei Dao show that the depth of the new port has increased from approximately 2.00 to 10.00 m, whereas the new land in the northeast region has changed from a depth of approximately 7.50 m to land. To date, approximately 584252.74 ± 228884.43 m3 of sediment has been excavated in the port area of Nanwei Dao, with 1010657.21 ± 897737.97 m3 of land reclaimed from the water. Overall, the Landsat series data can be used to detect temporal changes in the underwater terrain of coral islands in the range of approximately 0 to 10 m over the South China Sea for nearly 40 years, and achieving reliable 40-year long-term monitoring of water depths exceeding 10 m remains challenging."

 The formation and scavenging of secondary aerosol under extremely high humidity conditions (relative humidity >80 %) remained as an issue in subtropical urban areas. In order to evaluate the effects of aqueous-phase oxidation and wet removal on secondary organic aerosol (SOA) composition and dynamics, a field campaign, which mainly used a time-of-flight aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ToF-ACSM) to characterized the non-refractory PM2.5 (NR-PM2.5) composition, was carried out during autumn fog-rain periods (FRPs) in Chongqing, Southwestern China. The chemical composition of PM2.5 was characterized, and the factors impacting SOA formation were analyzed. The effects of regional transport on SOA were also investigated. The results showed that SOA, which included less oxidized oxygenated organic aerosol (LO-OOA) and more oxidized oxygenated organic aerosol (MO-OOA), dominated OA, contributing 80 % to total OA and 36 % to PM2.5. LO-OOA and MO-OOA concentrations increased with liquid water content (LWC) and oxidant levels (Ox), indicating aqueous-phase and photochemical pathways jointly promoted SOA formation. Compared to PreFRPs and PostFRPs, MO-OOA concentration decreased by 62 % and 1 % during FRPs, highlighting efficient wet scavenging. Notably, SOA exhibited higher removal efficiency than primary organic aerosol (POA), and MO-OOA tended to be more easily scavenged by fog and rain droplets than LO-OOA. Diurnal O/C ratios revealed enhanced nighttime oxidation under high humidity, while backward trajectories identified southern Chongqing as a key SOA source region. This study quantified the distinct scavenging efficiencies and formation processes of MO-OOA and LO-OOA under fog-rain conditions, bridging gaps in understanding SOA evolution in subtropical high-humidity environments."

Aerosol–cloud interactions are seen for both large and small aerosols, with higher IWC and ice crystal number concentration under higher aerosol concentrations. Large aerosols are more impactful than small aerosols. 
 Cirrus cloud formation and evolution are subject to the influences of thermodynamic and dynamic conditions and aerosols. This study developed near global-scale in situ aircraft observational datasets based on 12 field campaigns that spanned from the polar regions to the tropics from 2008 to 2016. Cirrus cloud microphysical properties were investigated at temperatures ≤ −40 °C, including ice water content (IWC), ice crystal number concentration (Ni), and number-weighted mean diameter (Di). Positive correlations were found between the fluctuations of these ice microphysical properties and the fluctuations of aerosol number concentrations for larger (> 500 nm) and smaller (> 100 nm) aerosols (i.e. Na500 and Na100, respectively). Steeper linear regression slopes were seen for large aerosols compared with smaller aerosols. Machine learning (ML) models showed that using relative humidity with respect to ice (RHi) as a predictor significantly increased the accuracy of predicting cirrus occurrences compared with temperature, vertical velocity (w), and aerosol number concentrations. The ML predictions of IWC fluctuations showed higher accuracies when larger aerosols were used as a predictor compared with smaller aerosols, even though their effects were similar when predicting cirrus occurrences. To predict IWC magnitudes accurately, aerosol concentrations were particularly important at 50 to 250 s scales (i.e. 10–50 km) and showed increasing effects at low temperatures, small ice supersaturation, and strong updraughts/downdraughts. These results improve the understanding of aerosol–cloud interactions and can be used to evaluate model parameterizations of cirrus cloud properties and processes."

However, the standard eddy-covariance method used for processing flux data has limitations, leading to data loss and limited resolution due to fixed time steps. This paper introduces a new method using wavelet analysis to increase temporal resolution and improve data retention. Applied at the Hesse forest flux tower in France, this approach provides high-resolution flux estimates, enhancing the accuracy of flux measurements. 
 We introduce a novel framework for estimating eddy fluxes using cross-scalogram smoothing, addressing key limitations of the standard eddy-covariance method. The standard approach suffers from fixed averaging times (typically 30 min) and limited frequency resolution, which can lead to biases and an inability to capture fast dynamics. Our method, based on wavelet transforms, allows for high-resolution analysis of fluxes in both time and frequency domains. It adaptively localises turbulent scales using a metric derived from the vertical component of the Reynolds stress tensor, enabling more accurate flux estimation under varying turbulence conditions. The proposed metric is similar to the u* and σw tests, but it is adapted to the time–frequency setting. By decoupling the filtering of perturbative scales from flux calculations, our approach allows for flexible averaging times. This adaptability makes it particularly suitable for studying rapid ecosystem responses to environmental changes, such as those occurring on timescales shorter than 1 h. We show application of the framework at the beech forest site Hesse (code FR-Hes) and demonstrate its relation with standard eddy-covariance calculations. The proposed method allows for varying the averaging time without impacting the filtering of the perturbative scales. It thus allows for producing estimates of CO2, latent heat, and sensible heat fluxes with faster dynamics (e.g. with 1, 10, and 30 min averaging time). We present statistics of the 10 min averaged fluxes and show that they align well with estimates of the 30 min standard eddy-covariance method. The improved localisation of turbulent scales results in higher estimates of carbon uptake during summer (+2 ± 1 µmolm-2s-1) and a more accurate assessment of nighttime respiration compared to standard eddy-covariance estimates. The methodology is implemented in the Julia package TurbulenceFlux.jl, making it readily accessible for practical applications."

The modifications were made primarily to control data from non-professional measurement networks, which may be of lower quality than professional data, especially in the case of personal stations. Accordingly, the modifications went in the direction of performing more sophisticated data control, applying weather radar data, and taking into account various aspects of data quality, such as consistency analysis of data time series and bias detection. The effectiveness of the modified system was verified based on independent measurement data from manual rain gauges, which are considered one of the most accurate measurement instruments, although they mostly provide daily totals. In addition, an analysis of two case studies is presented. This highlights various issues involved in using non-professional data to generate multi-source estimates of the precipitation field."

Zou,"A 3 h, 1 km surface soil moisture dataset for the contiguous United States from 2015 to 2023","We developed a 3 h, 1 km surface soil moisture dataset for the contiguous United States from 2015 to 2023 using the spatio-temporal fusion method. This dataset effectively combines the distinct advantages of two long-term surface soil moisture datasets, which is also the first hourly-level 1 km soil moisture dataset at the continental US scale. The new dataset could provide new insight into the fast changes in soil moisture along with drought and wet spell occurrences. 
 Surface soil moisture (SSM) is a critical variable for understanding the terrestrial hydrologic cycle, and it influences ecosystem dynamics, agriculture productivity, and water resource management. Although SSM information is widely estimated through satellite-derived and model-assimilated methods, datasets with fine spatio-temporal resolutions remain unavailable at the continental scale and yet are essential for improving weather forecasting, optimizing precision irrigation, and enhancing fire risk assessment. In this study, we developed a new 3 h, 1 km spatially seamless SSM dataset spanning 2015 to 2023, covering the entire contiguous United States (CONUS), using a spatio-temporal fusion model. This approach effectively combines the distinct advantages of two long-term SSM datasets, namely, the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) L4 SSM product and the Crop Condition and Soil Moisture Analytics (Crop-CASMA) dataset. The SMAP product provides spatially seamless SSM observations with a 3 h temporal resolution but at a 9 km spatial resolution, while the Crop-CASMA SSM dataset offers a finer spatial resolution of 1 km but has a daily temporal resolution and contains spatial gaps. To overcome the spatio-temporal mismatch between the two products, we developed a time series data mining approach known as the highly comparative time series analysis (HCTSA) method to extract multiple spatially seamless characteristics (e.g., maximum and mean) from the two inter-annual SSM datasets (i.e., SMAP and Crop-CASMA). Then, the fusion model was constructed using the extracted 9 and 1 km characteristics and each scene of the SMAP in turn. Finally, the 3 h, 1 km SSM data (named STF_SSM) were predicted from 2015 to 2023. The comparison with in situ data from multiple SSM observation networks showed that the performance of our STF_SSM dataset is better than the Crop-CASMA and is close to the SMAP L4 product, with a mean correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.716 at the daily scale and 0.689 at the 3 h scale. The STF_SSM dataset in this study is the first long-time-series, spatially seamless SSM dataset to realize continuous intra-day 1 km SSM observations every 3 h across the CONUS, which provides a new insight into the fast changes in soil moisture along with drought and wet spell occurrences and ecosystem responses. Additionally, this dataset provides a valuable data source for the calibration and validation of land surface models. The STF_SSM dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5066/P13CCN69 (Yang et al., 2025a)."

They can support conservation planning, environmental policy, and restoration efforts, aligning with Australia’s Strategy for Nature and global biodiversity targets to protect intact ecosystems and promote sustainable development. 
 Australia's unique biodiversity faces significant threats from anthropogenic activities that drive habitat destruction and degradation. This study presents the first comprehensive national-scale cumulative pressure map for terrestrial Australia since the 1980s, providing key insights into human disturbance of the landscape. We developed a Human Industrial Footprint (HIF) index incorporating 16 nationally relevant pressure layers, offering a more accurate representation of industrial influences than previous global-scale analyses. The HIF was used to derive an Ecological Intactness Index (EII), accounting for habitat quality, fragmentation, and connectivity. A technical validation comparing visually scored pressures in 1397 stratified random samples using high-resolution satellite images revealed a strong agreement with the HIF. We also conducted an uncertainty (sensitivity) analysis by adjusting individual pressure scores by up to ±50 % across 100,000 simulations, which showed a moderate impact on cumulative pressure scores, confirming the robustness of our approach. We believe these high-resolution datasets can be valuable tools for guiding conservation efforts, such as informing protected area expansion, ecosystem restoration priorities, and biodiversity offset strategies. By offering a detailed assessment of cumulative pressures and ecological integrity, this study addresses a critical knowledge gap, and can support evidence-based decision-making for Australia's biodiversity conservation and sustainable development objectives.

The changing climate has increased the frequency and severity of global fire events. Forested watersheds and their ecosystem functions are greatly disrupted during fire activity. Postfire concerns in forested watersheds include unpredictable and potentially simultaneous alterations in source water quality and hydro-biogeochemical processes. The degree of fire severity can complexly modify water quality through the production of fire-transformed constituents on the burned forest floor (i.e., nutrients, metal(loid)s, dissolved organic matter, and the formation of disinfection byproducts). Correspondingly, fire severity and postfire rainfall patterns can refine hydro-biogeochemical processes that influence the transport of the fire-transformed constituents (i.e., vegetation function, soil structure, hydrological pathways, and microbial communities). Postfire alterations to water quality and hydro-biogeochemical processes introduce further complexity with varying temporal influence, which ranges from months to decades. As postfire water quality and watershed response research progresses, it is essential to homogenize interdisciplinary expertise to bridge knowledge gaps between fields ranging from forest ecology, hydrology, microbiology, and geochemistry. A multidisciplinary approach in wildfire research will facilitate a comprehensive perception of the diverse water quality risks associated with fire activity and mitigate fire concerns on a global level."

This study aims to analyze daily discharge patterns in influent wastewater to identify recurring patterns for trace organic compounds, particularly those from domestic sources, providing insights into discharge dynamics originating from population chemical consumption and exposure. Over three 24-h periods, hourly composite influent samples from a wastewater treatment plant were analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Target and non-target screening revealed over 72,000 features, with 402 target compounds annotated. Temporal k-means clustering of target compounds identified five distinct daily patterns, with two clusters linked to domestic use: one correlated with wastewater flow, representing general daily population activities, and another showing a morning peak, likely associated with morning urine. Based on these patterns, cluster predictions were applied to the non-targeted feature list, prioritizing features with similar temporal trends. This led to 70 additional features associated with the morning peak pattern, with four compounds exemplarily identified. The findings highlight the value of combining targeted and non-targeted analyzes with clustering methods to improve the interpretation of complex wastewater data and unravel chemical discharge patterns linked to population exposure."

Manganese oxy(hydr)oxides (MnOx) are powerful oxidants in nature and may promote the oxidative transformation of organic P compounds; yet little is known about the role of MnOx in the molecular transformation and speciation of P from natural organic matter. Here, we investigated the molecular transformation of vermicompost-derived organic P under acidic and alkaline pH conditions in dissolved organic matter (DOM) and soil over a 35 d period. Phosphorus K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure revealed the formation of birnessite-adsorbed phosphate and Mn(II/III) phosphate at pH 4 and calcium phosphate at pH 8 in the DOM system. Birnessite-adsorbed phosphate was dominant in soils, followed by Mn(III) phosphate after 35 d. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry indicated enhanced organic P sorption and transformation into higher molecular weight aromatic compounds under acidic conditions. These findings reveal that birnessite not only mediates P speciation through surface and redox-driven interactions but also facilitates organic P stabilization via molecular transformation. The study provides new insights into how MnOx can influence both P fate in natural environments, with implications for mechanisms controlling P mobility and long-term P retention in soils."

In recent years, environmental and health concerns on LCMs have mainly focused on nematic and smectic LCMs. However, information regarding cholesteric LCMs in the environment remains lacking. Herein, we made the first comprehensive screening of cholesteric LCMs in e-waste dust. Target analysis uncovered the presence of 28 cholesteric LCMs in dust samples, including 14 fatty acid cholesteryl esters (FACEs), 9 alkyl carbonate cholesteryl esters (ACCEs), and 5 other-type cholesteryl esters. According to the analogous characteristics of FACEs, a suspect screening framework identified an additional 43 long-chain FACEs. Overall, 71 cholesteric LCMs were identified, with 30 detected in >50% of samples. The median and highest values of their sum concentrations were 94.3 and 1880 ng/g, respectively. FACEs emerged as the dominant group, with long-chain FACEs, particularly FACEs (18:0), exhibiting significantly more abundance than short-chain and medium-chain FACEs. In silico predictive modeling revealed that most of these newly identified cholesteric LCMs exhibited medium-to-high estrogenic/androgenic activities.

Nontarget screening (NTS) analysis allows for the simultaneous chemical identification and quantitative reporting of tens of thousands of chemicals in complex environmental matrices, whereas the computational toxicology (CT) serves as another high-throughput means of rapidly and comprehensively screening chemicals for toxicity. To date, there has been a lack of guidance on how to combine NTS experiments and CT for the risk assessment of chemical mixtures and the prioritization of pollutants.

However, whether NPs induce renal fibrosis remains contentious, and the reversibility of NPs-triggered nephrotoxicity has rarely been reported. This study investigated the role of lysosomes in renal fibrosis induced by low-level polystyrene (PS) NPs with particle sizes of 100 and 500 nm (PS100 and PS500) in mice using Masson staining, immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, fluorescence imaging, and other techniques. The results showed that PS100 induced more pronounced renal fibrosis than PS500. Mechanistically, PS NPs promoted autophagosome formation accompanied by the inhibition of autophagic degradation. Moreover, PS NPs impaired lysosomal degradation function, evidenced by reduced CTSB and CTSD protein levels. This impairment blocked autophagic flux, thereby inducing renal fibrosis, which was further confirmed by in vitro results. Notably, lysosomal exocytosis plays a crucial role in the clearance of NPs from mouse kidneys through activating Mcoln1 expression, which contributes to restoring autophagic flux and alleviating renal fibrosis during recovery. Collectively, our findings provide the first evidence that lysosomes serve dual functions in the persistence and reversibility of NPs-induced nephrotoxicity, which could be valuable for the intervention and mitigation of kidney damage resulting from environmental NPs exposure."

A detailed investigation of the equatorial shadow region confirms that the dense plasmasphere blocks AKR emissions across all wave frequencies. Low‐frequency emissions (<100 kHz) are presents outside the shadow region at larger radial distance, which is attributed to magnetosheath reflection, while higher‐frequency emissions (>100 kHz) propagate via plasmaspheric ducting and leakage, filling the equatorial region immediately outside the plasmasphere. Ray‐tracing simulations identify low‐density ducts within the plasmasphere as crucial channels that enable AKR to penetrate the dense plasmasphere, particularly at higher frequencies.

These patterns capture joint spatial and temporal signals of precipitation anomalies, rather than only spatial or temporal patterns individually. Consideration of the joint patterns provides a physical constraint that helps identify those more robust predictors, which as a result, are closely linked to the full seasonal evolution of precipitation anomalies. Based on these spatiotemporal patterns and their predictors reflecting slowly varying atmospheric boundary conditions, we develop a physical‐statistical prediction model that significantly improves predictions of both the detailed seasonal evolution and the rainy‐season mean of HMA precipitation anomalies.

We found that for electrons less than 200 keV on dawnside between L shell of 6–10, the precipitation ratio (the ratio between precipitating flux and locally trapped flux) increases with increasing L and decreasing energy. This is caused by chorus wave pitch angle scattering precipitation. Conversely, the precipitation ratio increases with L and energy for electrons greater than 200 keV on both dawnside and duskside between L = 8–10.

Delworth,Projected Response of Santa Ana Winds Over Southern California to Global Warming by a High‐Resolution Climate Model,"Santa Ana winds (SAWs), notorious for fueling the most destructive wildfires over Southern California, are exceptionally dry offshore katabatic winds that descend adiabatically from the inland arid plateau. Here, we investigate how model grid resolution affects the simulation of present and future SAWs using ensemble simulations from a newly developed climate model with varying atmospheric resolutions (100, 50, and 25 km). At finer resolutions, the model better resolves coastal mountains, strengthening the land‐sea temperature gradients conducive to SAWs and enhancing adiabatic warming over the leeward side. Consequently, the frequency and intensity of SAWs at 25‐km model resolution are significantly more realistic than at coarser resolution. As climate warms, while the occurrence of SAWs decreases across all resolutions (approximately −10%), the changes in their impacts are resolution dependent. At finer resolution, future SAWs are projected to further exacerbate wildfire risks over coastal Southern California due to an increased vapor pressure deficit."

Using high spatiotemporal resolution observations from a C‐band phased array radar (PAR), assimilated into a four‐dimensional variational data assimilation system, we primarily analyze dynamical processes contributing to the development of the supercell storm and its associated mesocyclone. Our study shows that just before the convective cell is triggered, a significant convergence zone develops to the west of the terrain, forming several meso‐γ vortices near the surface. During the merger of the convective cell and the QLCS from upper to lower levels, a strong downdraft generated by the QLCS enhances low‐level horizontal convergence, further producing a stretching effect on the vortices within the storm and significantly increasing vertical vorticity. With the formation of the mesocyclone in the mature stage of supercell storm, the height of the rotational center rises to 4.5 km, and the maximum rotational velocity reaches 20 m/s. Our results indicate that the surface convergence lines and the meso‐γ vortices along them strengthen low‐level convergence and generate strong updrafts, triggering the initial storm. These intense updrafts transform horizontal vorticity into vertical vorticity and transport it upward. Additionally, the process of convective merging leads to strengthen low‐level horizontal convergence, which forcibly stretches the mesovortex, enhancing vertical vorticity and allowing the convective storm to develop in a strong, organized manner and form the supercell storm."

However, the effect of WWBs on the oceanic intraseasonal Kelvin waves in the context of ENSO diversity formation remains largely unexplored owing to limited observational data and theoretical analysis. To explore ENSO diversity mechanisms, we employ a combination of 20–90–day bandpass filtering, complex empirical orthogonal function analysis and composite analysis to investigate to what extent the oceanic Kelvin waves are influenced by WWBs. From filtered sea level anomalies in the equatorial Pacific Ocean (150°E−100°W, 2°S–2°N) between 1993 and 2023, we identified 149 downwelling and 119 upwelling Kelvin waves. During eastern‐Pacific (EP) El Niño years, the WWBs have a further east active center, stronger intensity, a larger zonal extent and longer duration compared to central‐Pacific (CP) El Niño years. Similarly, Kelvin waves have stronger intensity, broader extension, and zonal distribution along the equator in EP El Niño years than in CP El Niño years. Statistical and composite analysis reveal a consistent relationship between the zonal range, center location, duration, strength of WWBs and the corresponding response of Kelvin waves (center location, speed, duration, amplitude) across CP and EP El Niño years. The finding implies that WWBs may act as a precursor to ENSO diversity from an oceanic perspective, playing a key role in both the theoretical framework and prediction of ENSO diversity."

 Living biological systems rely on the continuous operation of chemical reaction networks. These networks sustain out-of-equilibrium regimes in which chemical energy is continually converted into controlled mechanical work and motion1–3. Out-of-equilibrium reaction networks have also enabled the design and successful development of artificial autonomously operating molecular machines4,5, in which networks comprising pairs of formally—but non-microscopically—reverse reaction pathways drive controlled motion at the molecular level. In biological systems, the concurrent operation of several reaction pathways is enabled by the chemoselectivity of enzymes and their cofactors, and nature’s dissipative reaction networks involve several classes of reactions. By contrast, the reactivity that has been harnessed to develop chemical reaction networks in pursuit of artificial molecular machines is limited to a single reaction type. Only a small number of synthetic systems exhibit chemically fuelled continuous controlled molecular-level motion6–8 and all exploit the same class of acylation–hydrolysis reaction. Here we show that a redox reaction network, comprising concurrent oxidation and reduction pathways, can drive chemically fuelled continuous autonomous unidirectional motion about a C–C bond in a structurally simple synthetic molecular motor based on an achiral biphenyl. The combined use of an oxidant and reductant as fuels and the directionality of the motor are both enabled by exploiting the enantioselectivity and functional separation of reactivity inherent to enzyme catalysis.

 Atherosclerosis is the main underlying cause of cardiovascular diseases. Its prevention is based on the detection and treatment of traditional cardiovascular risk factors1. However, individuals at risk for early vascular disease often remain unidentified2. Recent research has identified new molecules in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis3, highlighting the need for alternative disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets to improve early diagnosis and therapy efficacy. Here, we observed that imidazole propionate (ImP), produced by microorganisms, is associated with the extent of atherosclerosis in mice and in two independent human cohorts. Furthermore, ImP administration to atherosclerosis-prone mice fed with chow diet was sufficient to induce atherosclerosis without altering the lipid profile, and was linked to activation of both systemic and local innate and adaptive immunity and inflammation. Specifically, we found that ImP caused atherosclerosis through the imidazoline-1 receptor (I1R, also known as nischarin) in myeloid cells. Blocking this ImP–I1R axis inhibited the development of atherosclerosis induced by ImP or high-cholesterol diet in mice. Identification of the strong association of ImP with active atherosclerosis and the contribution of the ImP–I1R axis to disease progression opens new avenues for improving the early diagnosis and personalized therapy of atherosclerosis.

 Birds have a sex chromosome system in which females are heterogametic (ZW) and males are homogametic (ZZ)1. The differentiation of avian sex chromosomes from ancestral autosomes entails the loss of most genes from the W chromosome during evolution1,2. However, the extent to which mechanisms evolved that counterbalance this substantial reduction in female gene dosage remains unclear. Here we report functional in vivo and evolutionary analyses of a Z-linked microRNA (miR-2954) with strong male-biased expression, previously proposed to mediate avian sex chromosome dosage compensation3. We knocked out miR-2954 in chicken, which resulted in early embryonic lethality in homozygous knockout males, probably driven by specific upregulation of dosage-sensitive Z-linked target genes. Evolutionary gene expression analyses further revealed that these dosage-sensitive target genes underwent both transcriptional and translational upregulation on the single Z in female birds. Altogether, this work unveils a scenario in which evolutionary pressures following W gene loss drove transcriptional and translational upregulation of dosage-sensitive Z-linked genes in females but also their transcriptional upregulation in males. The resulting excess of transcripts in males, resulting from the combined activity of two upregulated dosage-sensitive Z gene copies, was in turn offset by the emergence of a highly targeted miR-2954-mediated transcript degradation mechanism during avian evolution. This study uncovered a unique sex chromosome dosage compensation system in birds, in which a microRNA has become essential for male survival.

 Immigrants to high-income countries often face considerable and persistent difficulties in the labour market1–6, whereas their native-born children typically experience economic progress6–9. However, little is known about the extent to which these immigrant–native earnings differences stem from unequal pay when doing the same work for the same employer versus labour market processes that sort immigrants into lower-paid jobs. Here, using data from nine European and North American countries, we show that the segregation of workers with immigrant backgrounds into lower-paying jobs accounts for about three-quarters of overall immigrant–native earnings differences. Although within-job pay inequality remains notable for immigrants in several countries, our results demonstrate that unequal access to higher-paying jobs is the primary driver of the immigrant–native pay gap across a range of institutionally and demographically diverse contexts. These findings highlight the importance of policies aimed at reducing between-job segregation, such as language training10–13, job training13–15, job search assistance programmes13,15, improving access to domestic education13,16,17, recognizing foreign qualifications18,19, and settlement programmes aimed at enhancing access to job-relevant information and networks13,20,21. Policies that target employer bias in hiring and promotion decisions are also likely to be effective, whereas measures aimed at ensuring equal pay for equal work may have more limited scope for further progress in closing the immigrant–native pay gap22–28.

 Tumour necrosis is associated with poor prognosis in cancer1,2 and is thought to occur passively when tumour growth outpaces nutrient supply. Here we report, however, that neutrophils actively induce tumour necrosis. In multiple cancer mouse models, we found a tumour-elicited Ly6GHighLy6CLow neutrophil population that was unable to extravasate in response to inflammatory challenges but formed neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) more efficiently than classical Ly6GHighLy6CHigh neutrophils. The presence of these ‘vascular-restricted’ neutrophils correlated with the appearance of a ‘pleomorphic’ necrotic architecture in mice. In tumours with pleomorphic necrosis, we found intravascular aggregates of neutrophils and NETs that caused occlusion of the tumour vasculature, driving hypoxia and necrosis of downstream vascular beds. Furthermore, we found that cancer cells adjacent to these necrotic regions (that is, in ‘perinecrotic’ areas) underwent epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, explaining the paradoxical metastasis-enhancing effect of tumour necrosis. Blocking NET formation genetically or pharmacologically reduced the extent of tumour necrosis and lung metastasis. Thus, by showing that NETs drive vascular occlusion, pleomorphic necrosis and metastasis, we demonstrate that tumour necrosis is not necessarily a passive byproduct of tumour growth and that it can be blocked to reduce metastatic spread.

 Propagation of intense X-ray pulses through dense media has led to the observation of phenomena such as atomic X-ray lasing1,2, self-induced transparency3 and stimulated X-ray Raman scattering (SXRS)4. SXRS has been long predicted as a means to launch and probe valence-electron wavepackets and as a building block for nonlinear X-ray spectroscopies5,6. However, experimental observations of SXRS to date4,7,8 have not provided spectroscopic information, and theoretical modelling has largely implemented hard-to-realize phase-coherent attosecond pulses. Here we demonstrate SXRS with spectroscopic precision, that is, detection of valence-excited states in neon with a near Fourier-limited joint energy–time resolution of 0.1 eV–40 fs. We used a new covariance analysis between statistically spiky broadband incident X-ray and scattered X-ray Raman pulses. Using 18,000 single shots, we beat not only the incident (about 8 eV) bandwidth but also the  approximately 0.2 eV instrumental energy resolution, thus creating super-resolution conditions, in analogy to super-resolved fluorescence microscopy9. Our experimental results, supported by ab initio propagation simulations, reveal the competition between lasing in the ion and stimulated Raman scattering in the neutral. We demonstrate enhanced signal collection efficiency and a broad excitation window, surpassing spontaneous Raman efficiencies by orders of magnitude. This stochastic SXRS approach represents a first step towards tracking elementary events that determine chemical outcomes10.

 To gain a comprehensive, unbiased perspective on molecular changes in the brain that may underlie the need for sleep, we have characterized the transcriptomes of single cells isolated from rested and sleep-deprived flies. Here we report that transcripts upregulated after sleep deprivation, in sleep-control neurons projecting to the dorsal fan-shaped body1,2 (dFBNs) but not ubiquitously in the brain, encode almost exclusively proteins with roles in mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis. These gene expression changes are accompanied by mitochondrial fragmentation, enhanced mitophagy and an increase in the number of contacts between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum, creating conduits3,4 for the replenishment of peroxidized lipids5. The morphological changes are reversible after recovery sleep and blunted by the installation of an electron overflow6,7 in the respiratory chain. Inducing or preventing mitochondrial fission or fusion8–13 in dFBNs alters sleep and the electrical properties of sleep-control cells in opposite directions: hyperfused mitochondria increase, whereas fragmented mitochondria decrease, neuronal excitability and sleep. ATP concentrations in dFBNs rise after enforced waking because of diminished ATP consumption during the arousal-mediated inhibition of these neurons14, which augments their mitochondrial electron leak7. Consistent with this view, uncoupling electron flux from ATP synthesis15 relieves the pressure to sleep, while exacerbating mismatches between electron supply and ATP demand (by powering ATP synthesis with a light-driven proton pump16) precipitates sleep. Sleep, like ageing17,18, may be an inescapable consequence of aerobic metabolism.

 The synthesis of enantiopure compounds is a central focus in organic chemistry owing to the prevalence of chiral centres in biological systems and the impact of homochirality on molecular properties. With growing recognition of electrochemistry as a powerful tool to improve the scope and sustainability of organic synthesis1, increasing efforts have been directed towards developing asymmetric electrocatalytic reactions to access challenging chiral molecules2–4. However, many useful electrochemical reactions rely on direct electrolysis without a catalyst, making them inherently difficult to render enantioselective. Supporting electrolytes are integral to electrochemical systems and, in addition to ensuring sufficient solution conductivity, they can influence the rate and selectivity of electrochemical transformations5. Chiral supporting electrolytes can mediate asymmetric reactions via direct electrolysis, but their use in organic electrosynthesis remains largely unexplored6,7. Here we describe the use of substoichiometric chiral phosphate salts as supporting electrolytes to facilitate the oxidation of racemic trivalent phosphines to afford enantioenriched phosphine oxides. Our approach relies on a dynamic-kinetic-resolution strategy that exploits the rapid pyramidal inversion of an anodically generated phosphoniumyl radical cation8, while a high concentration of chiral phosphate at the electrode–electrolyte interface9,10 enhances enantioselective control during rate-limiting nucleophilic addition. Our results highlight the promise of chiral supporting electrolytes for promoting radical-ion-mediated asymmetric transformations. Using a dynamic-kinetic-resolution strategy and chiral phosphate salts as supporting electrolytes, racemic trivalent phosphines can be oxidized to afford enantioenriched phosphine oxides."

 Whole-genome doubling (WGD) is a common feature of human cancers and is linked to tumour progression, drug resistance, and metastasis1–6. Here we examine the impact of WGD on somatic evolution and immune evasion at single-cell resolution in patient tumours. Using single-cell whole-genome sequencing, we analysed 70 high-grade serous ovarian cancer samples from 41 patients (30,260 tumour genomes) and observed near-ubiquitous evidence that WGD is an ongoing mutational process. WGD was associated with increased cell–cell diversity and higher rates of chromosomal missegregation and consequent micronucleation. We developed a mutation-based WGD timing method called doubleTime to delineate specific modes by which WGD can drive tumour evolution, including early fixation followed by considerable diversification, multiple parallel WGD events on a pre-existing background of copy-number diversity, and evolutionarily late WGD in small clones and individual cells. Furthermore, using matched single-cell RNA sequencing and high-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy, we found that inflammatory signalling and cGAS-STING pathway activation result from ongoing chromosomal instability, but this is restricted to predominantly diploid tumours (WGD-low). By contrast, predominantly WGD tumours (WGD-high), despite increased missegregation, exhibited cell-cycle dysregulation, STING1 repression, and immunosuppressive phenotypic states. Together, these findings establish WGD as an ongoing mutational process that promotes evolvability and dysregulated immunity in high-grade serous ovarian cancer. A single-cell sequencing study using more than 30,000 tumour genomes from human ovarian cancers shows that whole-genome doubling is an ongoing mutational process that drives tumour evolution and disrupts immunity."

 Most people in the USA manage their health by taking at least one prescription drug, and drugs classified as non-antibiotics can adversely affect the gut microbiome and disrupt intestinal homeostasis1,2. Here we identify medications that are associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal infections across a population cohort of more than one million individuals monitored over 15 years. Notably, the cardiac glycoside digoxin and other drugs identified in this epidemiological study are sufficient to alter the composition of the microbiome and the risk of infection with Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Tm) in mice. The effect of digoxin treatment on S. Tm infection is transmissible through the microbiome, and characterization of this interaction highlights a digoxin-responsive β-defensin that alters the microbiome composition and consequent immune surveillance of the invading pathogen. Combining epidemiological and experimental approaches thus provides an opportunity to uncover drug–host–microbiome–pathogen interactions that increase the risk of infections in humans. An analysis of prescription medications shows that several non-antibiotic drugs, such as the heart medication digoxin, can reduce the immune response to pathogens and increase the risk of gastrointestinal infections by altering the composition of the microbiome."

 Non-antibiotic drugs can alter the composition of the gut microbiome1, but they have largely unknown implications for human health2. Here we examined how non-antibiotics affect the ability of gut commensals to resist colonization by enteropathogens3. We also developed an in vitro assay to assess enteropathogen growth in drug-perturbed microbial communities. Pathogenic Gammaproteobacteria were more resistant to non-antibiotics than commensals and their post-treatment expansion was potentiated. For 28% of the 53 drugs tested, the growth of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium. (S. Tm) in synthetic and human stool-derived communities was increased, and similar effects were observed for other enteropathogens. Non-antibiotics promoted pathogen proliferation by inhibiting the growth of commensals, altering microbial interactions and enhancing the ability of S. Tm to exploit metabolic niches. Drugs that promoted pathogen expansion in vitro increased the intestinal S. Tm load in mice. For the antihistamine terfenadine, drug-induced disruption of colonization resistance accelerated disease onset and increased inflammation caused by S. Tm. Our findings identify non-antibiotics as previously overlooked risk factors that may contribute to the development of enteric infections.

 Hybridized matter–photon excitations in hyperbolic crystals—anisotropic materials characterized by permittivity tensor components with opposite sign—have attracted substantial attention owing to their strong light–matter interactions in the form of hyperbolic polaritons1–3. However, these phenomena have been restricted to hyperbolic crystals, whose optical responses are confined to fixed spectral regions and lack tunability, thereby limiting their broader applicability4,5. Here we demonstrate the emergence of hyperbolic surface phonon polaritons in a non-hyperbolic yttrium vanadate (YVO4) crystal. Using real-space nanoimaging combined with theoretical analyses, we visualize hyperbolic wavefronts of surface phonon polaritons on YVO4 crystal surfaces within its non-hyperbolic frequency range, where the permittivity tensor components of the material have the same negative sign. Furthermore, by varying the temperature from room temperature to cryogenic levels, we realize in situ manipulation of polariton dispersions, enabling a topological transition from hyperbolic to canalization and eventually to the elliptic regime. This temperature-controlled dispersion engineering not only provides precise control over polariton topology but also modulates their wavelength and group velocity, showing remarkable sensitivity alongside low-loss, long-range propagation. These findings extend the realm of hyperbolic nano-optics by removing the reliance on hyperbolic crystals, unlocking opportunities for applications in negative refraction6–10, superlensing11,12, polaritonic chemistry13, integrated photonics14–16 and beyond.

 Remodelling plant immune receptors has become a vital strategy for creating new disease resistance traits to combat the growing threat of plant pathogens to global food security and environmental sustainability1–17. However, current methods are constrained by the rapid evolution of plant pathogens and often lack broad-spectrum and durable protection. Here we report an innovative strategy to engineer broad-spectrum, durable and complete disease resistance in plants through expression of a chimeric protein containing a flexible polypeptide coupled with a single or dual conserved pathogen-originated protease cleavage site fused in frame to the N terminus of an autoactive nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich-repeat immune receptor (NLR) containing a coiled-coil or RESISTANCE TO POWDERY MILDEW 8-like coiled-coil domain. Following invasion, pathogen-originated specific proteases cleave the inactive chimeric protein to form free autoactive NLR, triggering broad-spectrum plant disease resistance. We demonstrate that a single engineered NLR can confer broad-spectrum and complete resistance against multiple potyviruses. Given that many pathogenic organisms across kingdoms encode proteases, this strategy has the potential to be exploited to control viruses, bacteria, oomycetes, fungi, nematodes and pests in plants. Cleavage by pathogen-derived proteases of an engineered chimeric protein activates its plant immune receptor component, enabling broad-spectrum resistance to pathogens in plants."

 With their superficially shark-like appearance, the Mesozoic ichthyosaurs provide a classic illustration of major morphological adaptations in an ancestrally terrestrial tetrapod lineage following the invasion of marine habitats1–3. Much of what is known about ichthyosaur soft tissues derives from specimens with body outlines4–6. However, despite offering insights into aspects of biology that are otherwise difficult to envisage from skeletal evidence alone (such as the presence of a crescentic fluke), information on their soft parts has hitherto been limited to a taxonomically narrow sample of small- to dolphin-sized animals2,4–6. Here we report the discovery of a metre-long front flipper of the large-bodied Jurassic ichthyosaur Temnodontosaurus, including unique details of its soft-tissue anatomy. In addition to revealing a wing-like planform, the fossil preserves a serrated trailing edge that is reinforced by novel cartilaginous integumental elements, herein denominated chondroderms. We also document chordwise-parallel skin ornamentations and a protracted fleshy distal tip that presumably acted like a flexible winglet in life. By integrating morphological and numerical data, we show that the observed features probably provided hydroacoustic benefits, and conclude that the visually guided7,8 Temnodontosaurus relied on stealth while hunting in dim-lit pelagic environments. This unexpected combination of control surface modifications represents a previously unrecognized mode of concealment, and underscores the importance of soft-tissue fossils when inferring aspects of palaeoethology and predator–prey palaeoecology.

 Solution-processed light-emitting diodes based on non-toxic copper–iodide hybrids1 are a compelling solution for efficient and stable deep-blue lighting, owing to their tunability, high photoluminescence efficiency and environmental sustainability2. Here we present a hybrid copper–iodide that shows near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield (99.6%) with an emission wavelength of 449 nm and colour coordinates (0.147, 0.087), alongside its emission mechanism and charge transport characteristics. We use the thin film of this hybrid as the sole active emissive layer to fabricate deep-blue light-emitting diodes and subsequently enhance the device performance through a dual interfacial hydrogen-bond passivation strategy. This synergetic surface modification approach, integrating a hydrogen-bond-acceptor self-assembled monolayer with an ultrathin polymethyl methacrylate capping layer, effectively passivates both heterojunctions of the copper–iodide hybrid emissive layer and optimizes charge injections. We achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency of 12.57%, a maximum luminance of 3,970.30 cd m−2 with colour coordinates (0.147, 0.091) and an excellent operational stability (half-lifetime) of 204 hours under ambient conditions.

 A pervasive dilemma in brain-wide association studies1 (BWAS) is whether to prioritize functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan time or sample size. We derive a theoretical model showing that individual-level phenotypic prediction accuracy increases with sample size and total scan duration (sample size × scan time per participant). The model explains empirical prediction accuracies well across 76 phenotypes from nine resting-fMRI and task-fMRI datasets (R2 = 0.89), spanning diverse scanners, acquisitions, racial groups, disorders and ages. For scans of ≤20 min, accuracy increases linearly with the logarithm of the total scan duration, suggesting that sample size and scan time are initially interchangeable. However, sample size is ultimately more important. Nevertheless, when accounting for the overhead costs of each participant (such as recruitment), longer scans can be substantially cheaper than larger sample size for improving prediction performance. To achieve high prediction performance, 10 min scans are cost inefficient. In most scenarios, the optimal scan time is at least 20 min. On average, 30 min scans are the most cost-effective, yielding 22% savings over 10 min scans. Overshooting the optimal scan time is cheaper than undershooting it, so we recommend a scan time of at least 30 min. Compared with resting-state whole-brain BWAS, the most cost-effective scan time is shorter for task-fMRI and longer for subcortical-to-whole-brain BWAS. In contrast to standard power calculations, our results suggest that jointly optimizing sample size and scan time can boost prediction accuracy while cutting costs.

 The metabolic activity of soil microbiomes has a central role in global nutrient cycles1. Understanding how soil metabolic activity responds to climate-driven environmental perturbations is a key challenge2,3. However, the ecological, spatial and chemical complexity of soils4–6 impedes understanding how these communities respond to perturbations. Here we address this complexity by combining dynamic measurements of respiratory nitrate metabolism7 with modelling to reveal functional regimes that define soil responses to environmental change. Measurements across more than 1,500 soil microcosms subjected to pH perturbations8,9 reveal regimes in which distinct mechanisms govern metabolite dynamics. A minimal model with two parameters, biomass activity and growth-limiting nutrient availability, predicts nitrate utilization dynamics across soils and pH perturbations. Parameter shifts under perturbation reveal three functional regimes, each linked to distinct mechanisms: (1) an acidic regime marked by cell death and suppressed metabolism; (2) a nutrient-limited regime in which dominant taxa exploit matrix-released nutrients; and (3) a resurgent growth regime driven by exponential growth of rare taxa in nutrient-rich conditions. We validated these model-derived mechanisms with nutrient measurements, amendment experiments, sequencing and isolate studies. Additional experiments and meta-analyses suggest that functional regimes are widespread in pH-perturbed soils. Experimental perturbation of soil pH leads to a generalizable model of the soil microcosm comprising three functional regimes with distinct mechanisms linking environmental change to metabolite dynamics."

 Early detection of structural heart disease is critical to improving outcomes, but widespread screening remains limited by the cost and accessibility of imaging tools such as echocardiography1,2. Recent advances in machine learning applied to heart rhythm recordings have shown promise in identifying disease3,4, although previous work has been limited by development in narrow populations or targeting only select heart conditions5. Here we introduce a deep learning model, EchoNext, trained on more than 1 million heart rhythm and imaging records across a large and diverse health system to detect many forms of structural heart disease. The model demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy in internal and external validation, outperforming cardiologists in a controlled evaluation and showing consistent performance across different care settings and racial and/or ethnic groups. The models were prospectively evaluated in a clinical trial of patients without previous cardiac imaging, successfully identifying previously undiagnosed heart disease. These findings support the potential of artificial intelligence to expand access to heart disease screening at scale.

 Liquids comprising two coexisting phases can form a range of stable and metastable states, including wetting films, droplets and threads1–3. Processes that permit rapid and reversible transformations between these morphologies, however, have been difficult to realize because physical properties required for rapid shape change (for example, low interfacial tension or viscosity) provide pathways for relaxation that result in short-lived states. Fully reversible formation of long-lived microdomain states would expand the palette of properties that can be accessed dynamically using biphasic liquids (for example, tunable optical metamaterials). Here we report the discovery of shape-shifting and bistable microdomains of a biphasic liquid system consisting of an isotropic oil and a liquid crystalline oil. The isotropic oil forms stable wetting films (‘original’ shape) between solid surfaces and an overlying liquid crystal phase, and, when exposed to a transient (<1 s) a.c. electric field at low frequency (10 Hz), transforms into long-lived (>24 h) spherical domains (‘temporary’ shape) stabilized by topological defects in the liquid crystal1,4,5. Subsequent application of an a.c. electric field of high frequency (1 kHz) triggers solitons to form in the liquid crystal6–8, creating kinetic pathways that lead to remarkably rapid (<3 s) coalescence of the dispersed spherical domains and recovery of the original shape (wetting film)1,8,9. We show rapid and reversible switching between distinct optical states of the biphasic system, with each state persisting without continuous application of the field, thus providing a combination of optical properties long sought in thin liquid films10–17.

Our results indicate that the environment in the inner disk region is influenced by sublimation of interstellar solids and subsequent refractory solid recondensation from this gas reservoir on timescales comparable with refractory condensation in our own Solar System. Observations at infrared and millimetre wavelengths of the young protostar HOPS-315 show a gaseous disk captured at the point at which solids are first starting to condense, the t = 0 for planet formation."

 A lithium (Li)-metal anode paired with a high-nickel cathode is considered to be a combination that holds promise to surpass the 500 Wh kg−1 threshold1,2. Approaching such high energy density, electrolytes capable of stabilizing both anode and cathode interphases are of importance to secure safe and long-term cycling3,4. Although anion-derived inorganic interphases have shown remarkable success at the Li side5–7, developing intrinsic strategies to concurrently protect both electrodes remains a key challenge. Here we report a micro-emulsion strategy for electrolyte design that bypasses the Li+ solvation regulation and produces fluoride-rich interphases for both electrodes. Specifically, liquid–liquid interfacial tension between the micelles and carbonate solvents, rather than the electric field, propels the motion of fluorinated droplets towards the anode and the cathode. In this way, the interphase construction of both electrodes can be enhanced and decoupled from the solvation structure strategy. Through use of the micro-emulsion electrolyte, two pouch full cells with energy densities of 531 Wh kg−1 and 547 Wh kg−1 retain 81% and 79% of their capacity after 189 and 155 cycles, respectively. The introduction of liquid–liquid interfacial tension provides a perspective for interphase regulation and electrolyte design, and paves the way for the development of high-voltage Li-metal batteries. Using an electrolyte micro-emulsion strategy, a lithium anode and high-voltage cathode can be simultaneously stabilized by liquid–liquid interfacial tension to achieve high-energy-density lithium-metal batteries."

Zunica,Observation of charge–parity symmetry breaking in baryon decays,"The LHCb experiment at CERN has observed significant asymmetries between the decay rates of the beauty baryon and its CP-conjugated antibaryon, thus demonstrating CP violation in baryon decays. 
 The Standard Model of particle physics—the theory of particles and interactions at the smallest scale—predicts that matter and antimatter interact differently due to violation of the combined symmetry of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). Charge conjugation transforms particles into their antimatter particles, whereas the parity transformation inverts spatial coordinates. This prediction applies to both mesons, which consist of a quark and an antiquark, and baryons, which are composed of three quarks. However, despite having been discovered in various meson decays, CP violation has yet to be observed in baryons, the type of matter that makes up the observable Universe. Here we report a study of the decay of the beauty baryon

The results reveal significant asymmetries between the decay rates of the

             baryon and its CP-conjugated antibaryon, providing, to our knowledge, the first observation of CP violation in baryon decays and demonstrating the different behaviours of baryons and antibaryons. In the Standard Model, CP violation arises from the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa mechanism2, and new forces or particles beyond the Standard Model could provide further contributions. This discovery opens a new path in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model.

 Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is the largest natural source of new nitrogen (N) that supports terrestrial productivity1,2, yet estimates of global terrestrial BNF remain highly uncertain3,4. Here we show that this uncertainty is partly because of sampling bias, as field BNF measurements in natural terrestrial ecosystems occur where N fixers are 17 times more prevalent than their mean abundances worldwide. To correct this bias, we develop new estimates of global terrestrial BNF by upscaling field BNF measurements using spatially explicit abundances of all major biogeochemical N-fixing niches. We find that natural biomes sustain lower BNF, 65 (52–77) Tg N yr−1, than previous empirical bottom-up estimates3,4, with most BNF occurring in tropical forests and drylands. We also find high agricultural BNF in croplands and cultivated pastures, 56 (54–58) Tg N yr−1. Agricultural BNF has increased terrestrial BNF by 64% and total terrestrial N inputs from all sources by 60% over pre-industrial levels. Our results indicate that BNF may impose stronger constraints on the carbon sink in natural terrestrial biomes and represent a larger source of agricultural N than is generally considered in analyses of the global N cycle5,6, with implications for proposed safe operating limits for N use7,8.

Maxwell,Prophages block cell surface receptors to preserve their viral progeny,"Zip promotes the accumulation of free phages in bacterial lysogen communities, safeguarding phage progeny. 
 In microbial communities, viruses compete for host cells and have evolved diverse mechanisms to inhibit competitors. One strategy is superinfection exclusion, whereby an established viral infection prevents a secondary infection of the same cell1. This phenomenon has been shown to have an important role in the spread of eukaryotic viruses. Here we determine that superinfection exclusion proteins in bacterial viruses (bacteriophages, hereafter phages) perform a similar role, promoting viral spread through the bacterial community. We characterize a phage protein that alters the dynamics of a common phage receptor, the type IV pilus. This protein, known as Zip, does not abrogate pilus activity, but fine-tunes it, providing a strong phage defence without a fitness cost. Notably, Zip also prevents internalization and destruction of newly released phage progeny, a phenomenon that we call the anti-Kronos effect after the Greek god who consumed his offspring. Zip activity promotes the accumulation of free phages in bacterial lysogen communities, thereby enhancing viral spread. We further demonstrate that the anti-Kronos effect is conserved across diverse prophage-encoded superinfection exclusion systems. Our results identify the mechanistic basis of a superinfection exclusion system that safeguards phage progeny and provide insights into the conservation of viral defence mechanisms among bacterial and eukaryotic systems. Zip promotes the accumulation of free phages in bacterial lysogen communities, safeguarding phage progeny."

 Swarm intelligence models represent a powerful tool to address complex tasks by multi-agent systems, although they are rarely used in practical applications as decentralized cooperation logic. Modern challenges include the improvement of model reliability with small swarm sizes and enhancing performance with minimal number of free parameters. Available techniques are generally tuned for computational optimization, at the expense of the applicability to real-world scenarios. Merging concepts from meta-heuristic methods and consensus theory we propose a swarm cooperation model which can act both as virtual optimizer and vehicle controller. The model shows a higher or equal success rate with respect to benchmark methods on 22 out of 33 landscapes when dealing with less equal 16 agents and low dimensional problems. Beyond multimodal optimization, a computational proof of concept shows that the method can successfully drive the contaminant localization in a complex marine environment by controlling a group of autonomous underwater vehicles.

Here the authors use attosecond X-ray spectroscopy to follow this process in the silane cation, observing how the distortion splits into one coherent and one stochastic pathway. 
 A fundamental approach to understanding chemical processes involves two key concepts: reaction paths and vibrational wavepackets. Collecting sufficient observables to experimentally determine these paths still challenges the latest advances in ultrafast science. Simultaneously observing the coherent nature of the wavepacket following them is even more challenging. Here, exploiting the sub-femtosecond time resolution (σ = 1 fs) of attosecond soft-X-ray-absorption spectroscopy, we overcome both of these challenges and observe a Jahn-Teller-mediated chemical reaction in its entirety—from initial symmetry breaking to beyond dissociation. We find that the Jahn-Teller effect in

These unprecedented insights into an ultrafast Jahn-Teller-mediated chemical reaction establish the unique potential of our experimental scheme for investigating chemical processes, particularly ones containing non-adiabatic dynamics or involving hydrogen atoms, which are notoriously difficult to detect with other methods, such as electron or X-ray diffraction.

 According to the World Meteorological Organization, 2023 was ranked as the second warmest year in the global surface temperature record since 1850, setting warm surface temperature records over more than 20% of the global land surface. In particular, the southwestern United States (US) and Northern Mexico experienced their longest stretch of record-breaking heat wave, affecting over 100 million people, causing over 200 deaths, and $14.5 billion in economic loss. Here we show that the 2023 heat wave event was linked to a strong anticyclonic blocking pattern that persisted for more than six weeks across the western US. Regression analysis and atmospheric model simulations suggest that the anticyclonic pattern was ultimately forced by the extremely warm sea surface temperature in the Atlantic. The combination of a warm Atlantic and a developing Pacific El Niño significantly amplified regional heat waves, doubling their number, tripling their days, and increasing their duration by about 50%.

We find that shipping carbon dioxide emissions in Ukraine’s Black Sea exclusive economic zone decreased by an average of 17.88% annually, while those in Romania’s and Turkey’s Black Sea exclusive economic zones increased by 36.30% and 16.08% annually, respectively. At the voyage level, shipping carbon dioxide emissions from maritime trade between Russia and the European Union obviously decreased, while those from maritime trade with certain Asian and Middle Eastern countries have obviously risen. The findings uncover the challenges to the climate change goal in the global shipping sector due to regional geopolitical crises. Carbon dioxide emissions from shipping in the Black Sea region decreased in Ukraine’s economic zone, and they increased in Romania’s and Turkey’s economic zones, from March 2021 to February 2024, according to an analysis that utilizes a ship emission assessment model."

 Samples from the carbonaceous asteroid Ryugu and CI (Ivuna-type) chondrites are dominated by low-temperature, aqueously formed secondary minerals, with rare occurrences of anhydrous primary minerals that formed in the high-temperature region of the solar protoplanetary disk. Here, we show that small (<a few tens of micrometers) Ca-Al-rich inclusions (CAIs) in Ryugu and Ivuna formed within ~0.2 Ma of the Solar System’s birth. These CAIs exhibit mineralogical, O-isotopic, and chronological similarities to CAIs in ordinary and other carbonaceous chondrites, indicating their ubiquitous presence across chondrites. In contrast, larger (>submillimeter) CAIs, commonly found in other carbonaceous chondrites and thought to have been retained via pressure bump(s) in the disk, are absent in Ryugu and CI chondrites. This absence implies that their parent planetesimals formed at a greater heliocentric distance, beyond the influence of a pressure bump created by proto-Jupiter, accreting only small CAIs that evaded radial drift toward the Sun.

Gray,Detailed observations reveal the genesis and dynamics of destructive debris-flow surges,"Debris-flow surges can form from the spontaneous growth of small surface instabilities into large waves that amplify flow destructiveness, according to high-resolution in situ measurements combined with a friction inversion and numerical simulations. 
 Debris flows are one of the most damaging natural hazards in mountainous terrain. Their dynamics are controlled by both surging behaviour and the influence of large boulders. However, a lack of high-resolution field measurements has limited our mechanistic understanding of these important processes. Here, we provide high-resolution in situ debris-flow surge measurements that demonstrate that surges are formed by the spontaneous growth of small surface instabilities into large waves, which amplify the destructiveness of the flow by increasing peak discharge. We use our field measurements to invert for the effective basal friction experienced by the flow, and support this reconstruction using numerical simulations that reproduce the formation and propagation of the surges. Detailed analysis of the inverted frictional data further shows that large boulders in the flow can influence local flow dynamics by increasing basal resistance, but this is not required to drive the surge wave instability. Our analysis provides new insights into debris-flow dynamics and can provide the foundation for improved hazard management of these damaging processes.

 Since Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) was launched in 2014, Interferometric Wide swath (IW) mode Level-2 radial velocity (RVL) products have been widely used to map fine-scale ocean surface current (OSC) in coastal zones. However, RVL product applications are restricted by non-geophysical and Wind-wave Induced Artifact Surface Velocity (WASV) errors. Previous studies have focused on improving the current retrieval accuracy in coastal zones, while neglecting open ocean regions and insufficient uncertainty analysis. To address these issues, a non-geophysical correction scheme suitable for both coastal and open sea is proposed by considering land coverage within SAR scenes. Corrected RVL products are validated using 1282 drifters and 78,054 HF radar points collected from the U.S. East Coast, West Coast, and Hawaiian Islands, showing overall accuracy improvements exceeding 60 %. To investigate the impact of WASV correction under different sea states (e.g. pure wind wave, wind wave dominant mix sea, swell dominant mix sea, and pure swell), a total of 127,534 matching points collected from January 2018 to May 2019 are used to assess the performance of four correction schemes. These include CDOP, KaDOP with wind and swell inputs, KaDOP with wind and wind-sea inputs, and CDOP-Yn. A comprehensive comparison with HF radar current reveals that CDOP performs poorly in pure wind wave sea (RMSE up to 0.34 m/s), while incorporating sea state parameters enhances the retrieval accuracy. KaDOP and CDOP-Yn yield comparable performance, while KaDOP performs better in pure wind or wind wave dominant mix sea, achieving RMSE of 0.21 m/s and a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.62. The correlation between SAR-derived and in-situ currents also varies with incidence angle, satellite track, and polarization. Overall, these results provide reliable OSC data for mesoscale and sub-mesoscale ocean dynamics research."

 Automated mapping and change analysis of urban land use are crucial tasks for examining the patterns of urban development and effectively directing the sustainable management of urban land resources. High-resolution (HR) remote sensing imagery offers abundant spatial details and clear urban structures. However, the existing change detection methods require high-quality paired samples and are based on the assumption that the training and test data are independent and identically distributed, and thus lack the flexibility to generalize the trained model to new temporal images. In response to the challenge, a multi-temporal urban scene classification and change detection (MtUS-CCD) framework is proposed to realize urban land-use mapping and change analysis, with the real geographic boundaries provided by OpenStreetMap (OSM) road networks. The key model of the proposed MtUS-CCD framework is the deep geospatial-temporal Adaptation Network based on partial self-traIning and geospatial-Temporal Alignment (ANITA). The ANITA model employs a geospatial-temporal alignment (GTA) strategy to align the geographical locations of multi-temporal images, acquiring deep features that are invariant to temporal domain shifts. Label migration and self-training classification (STC) are also performed to enhance the model's discriminative capacity for cross-temporal urban scene classification in images obtained from new time phases. To relieve the significant scale differences and high shape variability among urban parcels, the ANITA model leverages the area-weighted voting (AWV) strategy to achieve land-use mapping based on the multi-temporal comprehensive OSM road network data. Subsequently, post-classification comparison (PCC) enables the acquisition of the land-use change directions. The experimental results obtained on tri-temporal datasets from China demonstrate that the MtUS-CCD framework shows a significant improvement in cross-temporal urban scene classification and change detection tasks conducted in different regions. Furthermore, this framework shows robust effectiveness and generalization in a large-scale application for the whole of the city of Wuhan in China. Through comparative analysis with policy planning, it is demonstrated that the urban development patterns inferred by this framework are accurate and reliable, providing strong support for the realization of sustainable development goals."

 Clouds are a key factor influencing transmission of the radiance signal in optical remote sensing images. For mapping or monitoring the Earth's surface, it is inevitable to mask or remove clouds before applying optical remote sensing images. Nowadays, deep learning (DL) based thin cloud removal methods far outperform traditional methods. Yet these DL-based methods often overlook position information or the physical cloud model in thermal bands. Moreover, most existing cloud physical models for cloud removal overlook the down-transmittance of the cloud in optical bands and do not account for the radiance of thermal bands. This work proposes a novel transformer network, CloudRuler, coupled with three rules in remote sensing domain for cloud removal. The proposed CloudRuler can distinguish the semantic meanings between similar features in different pixel positions by utilizing the Half-Spherical Coordinate System, aggregating features from local neighborhood windows with remote sensing mosaicking, and solving the parameters of the cloud physical model without limitations. Experimental results on 20 paired Landsat 8 and 9 images demonstrate that CloudRuler outperforms seven baseline methods, based on GAN, CNN, and transformer, both visually and quantitatively. Ablation experiments demonstrate that the proposed rule-based modules are highly effective in improving CloudRuler's performance for thin cloud removal. This work demonstrates that the joint use of Landsat 8 and 9 images for cloud removal is effective, producing more reliable data for downstream applications than methods that utilize only one satellite with a longer revisit period.

 This study evaluates the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of different Earth Observation (EO) products for assessing olive trees’ health in a 6.2 ha orchard. We developed a digital crop mapping approach using high-resolution multispectral imagery from three sources: unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) at 2 cm spatial resolution, Mohammed VI satellite at 50 cm, and Sentinel-2 satellite at 10 m. Leaf chlorophyll content, measured for 75 trees using a SPAD meter, served as the dependent variable for predictive modeling and a proxy of trees’ health. Furthermore, three machine learning algorithms, Random Forest (RF), Cubist, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were employed to predict chlorophyll content. The RF model showed superior performance across all datasets, achieving the lowest RMSE values. While UAV data provided the highest spatial detail, capturing fine-scale health variations, it came at a significantly higher cost. The commercial Mohammed VI satellite data offered a balance between detail and coverage, potentially cost-effective for areas approaching its 100 km2 minimum purchase requirement. However, the free Sentinel-2 data showed competitive performance, particularly with the RF model (RMSE: 7.773, RPIQ: 1.251), suggesting its viability for large-scale monitoring. Spatial chlorophyll maps revealed distinct capabilities of each EO product in capturing orchard variability. Our findings highlight the trade-offs between EO product costs, resolutions, and predictive accuracy, providing crucial insights for selecting appropriate remote sensing approaches based on specific monitoring requirements and budget constraints. This research underscores the potential of integrating diverse EO products with advanced ML techniques for cost-effective and scalable olive tree health assessment, with implications for precision agriculture and sustainable orchard management.

 sUnderstanding the dynamic evolution of dry-wet transition events (DWTEs) at different time scales is significant in water resources planning, agricultural development, and disaster risk reduction in a changing climate. The   southeast coastal region of China has been identified as a hot spot; however, the evolution of DWTEs at different time scales is unclear.

The potential influence of large-scale climate oscillations, including the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) on the magnitude of DWTEs at the 30-day scale was assessed using Bayesian quantile regression. The results reveal (1) Extreme dry events were more prevalent and intense in the southern coastal area, whereas extreme wet events occurred predominantly and were more intense in the northern area. (2) High-frequency, high-magnitude DWTEs occurred along the coast at all time scales, and as the time scale increased, events with short duration shifted from the coast to the inland region. At the 30- and 90-day time scales, frequency generally decreased while magnitude increased, with the duration shortening in most regions. This indicates that the risk of DWTEs at short time scales has intensified over the past 60 years. (3) Strong large-scale climate oscillations significantly affected the DWTEs' magnitude. The NAO primarily impacted inland area, whereas ENSO and PDO exerted stronger influences on coastal area."

These three areas combined cover 35% of the global range of carnivores. Reducing human pressure on conservation lands and managing them to protect carnivores are therefore critical, yet challenging. The extent of carnivore ranges outside these areas underscores the necessity to expand the network of conservation lands, which are a pivotal component of global conservation planning, alongside broader proactive species-specific conservation measures."

Ti-mitoEVs that contain abundant functional mitochondria can be highly efficiently isolated from muscles via an optimized method. In vitro, Ti-mitoEV treatment increased mitochondrial biogenesis and reduced mitochondrial damage in recipient cells, and these effects occurred at least partly via mitochondrial genome transfer.

However, hypothesized sources including expanding lakes, peatlands, and destabilized permafrost or hydrates fail to explain this rapid increase. We use biomarkers, isotopes, and radiocarbon data to reconstruct temperature change, methane cycling, and permafrost thaw from a Tibetan thermokarst lake. Radiocarbon evidence and ultradepleted δ13C values (−80.3 per mil) of methane-diagnostic lipids indicate intense cycling of ancient (~2500-year-old) methane during the Younger Dryas–Preboreal transition, coeval with the AMC surge and the most rapid warming. By contrast, methane cycling was weak during the Holocene Climatic Optimum despite peak temperatures. These findings imply that anomalously high rates of warming, rather than absolute temperature alone, may play an important role in triggering enhanced paleo-methane cycling.

In contrast, robots today are primarily monolithic machines with limited ability to self-repair, physically develop, or incorporate material from their environments. While robot minds rapidly evolve new behaviors through artificial intelligence, their bodies remain closed systems, unable to systematically integrate material to grow or heal. We argue that open-ended physical adaptation is only possible when robots are designed using a small repertoire of simple modules. This allows machines to mechanically adapt by consuming parts from other machines or their surroundings and shed broken components. We demonstrate this principle on a truss modular robot platform. We show how robots can grow bigger, faster, and more capable by consuming materials from their environment and other robots. We suggest that machine metabolic processes like those demonstrated here will be an essential part of any sustained future robot ecology."

On the basis of models of swimming at small size scales, we designed and fabricated a muscle-powered, flagellate swimmer. We investigate the design of a compliant mechanism based on nonlinear mechanics and its mechanical integration with a muscle ring and motor neurons. We find that within a range of anchor stiffnesses around 1 micronewton per micrometer, the homeostatic tension in muscle is insensitive to stiffness, offering greater design flexibility. The proximity of motor neurons results in a fourfold improvement in muscle contractility. Improved contractility and nonlinear design allow for a peak swimming speed about two orders of magnitude higher than previous biohybrid flagellate swimmers, reaching 0.58 body lengths per minute (86.8 micrometers per second), by a mechanism involving inertia that we verify through flow field imaging.

Host-responsive CathB proteins localize to plant processing bodies (p-bodies), cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granules involved in messenger RNA storage or decay. Upon localization, these CathB proteins recruit key immune regulators EDS1, PAD4, and ADR1 to these bodies, suppressing plant defenses. A plant protein, Acd28.9 (Hsp20 family), counteracts this CathB activity and contributes to plant resistance to aphids.

NRBP1 pseudokinase is closely related to WNK isoforms and contains a RΦ-motif–binding conserved C-terminal (CCT) domain, like the CCT domains in WNKs, SPAK, and OXSR1. Knockdown or knockout of NRBP1 markedly inhibited basal as well as sorbitol-induced activation of WNK1 and downstream components. We demonstrate that recombinant NRBP1 can directly induce the activation of WNK4 in vitro. AlphaFold-3 modeling predicts that WNK1, SPAK, NRBP1, and TSC22D4 form a complex, in which two TSC22D4 RΦ-motifs interact with the CCTL1 domain of WNK1 and the CCT domain of NRBP1.

Our analysis revealed extensive transcriptional alterations across retinal cell types with aging. HP experiments demonstrated that systemic factors from young mice rejuvenated aged retinas and alleviated senescent phenotypes, while aged blood accelerated aging in young mice. Integrative analysis pinpointed adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and the downstream adenosine 5′-monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway as central to the molecular mechanisms underlying retinal rejuvenation. Treatment with the AdipoR1 agonist AdipoRon reversed retinal aging.

However, the cellular basis of how reward and uncertainty interact remains unclear. To investigate, we trained rats on a task where odor cues predicted sucrose rewards with varying uncertainties in delay or magnitude. Single-unit recordings revealed that many OFC neurons encoded expected uncertainties related to reward delay or magnitude. Population-level analysis showed distinct neural codes for delay and magnitude uncertainties, separate from those for reward delay and magnitude. Signals for each reward attribute and associated uncertainty converged onto the same neurons, reducing the sensitivity of delay and magnitude encoding as uncertainty increased. These findings suggest a cellular-level computation in OFC neurons, whereby uncertainty signals are integrated into attribute-specific reward representations, potentially supporting flexible learning and risk control."

This screen revealed a notable synthetic lethality when MYC inhibition was paired with disruption of mitochondrial complex I components, but not other complexes. Mechanistically, MYC inhibition reduced oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, triggering a compensatory up-regulation of complex I genes. Consequently, genetic or pharmacological targeting of complex I sensitized tumors to MYCi975 treatment, leading to increased purine catabolism and infiltration of CD8+T cells and macrophages into tumors. Additionally, a wide range of tumor cells with lower complex I expression showed increased MYC dependency.

This enhancement arises from the lower energy barriers for dipole flipping and domain switching associated with BDs, in comparison to conventional domain structures. Under an applied electric field, the rotation of polarized BDs, combined with a reduction in dipole flux due to the articulated rotation between BDs and surrounding domains, further amplifies the strain response.

The platform is applied to normal and cancerous breast epithelial cells in either mono- or coculture, correlating EIS measurements with cell growth parameters obtained from automated microscopy image analysis. An ML model is implemented to accurately predict the spatiotemporal evolution of cell density and size and to classify the different cell types based solely on EIS recordings. The technology is also shown to be capable of tracking pertinent biological processes including spatial heterogeneities in cell proliferation patterns and cell competition in coculture."

However, fabricating microscale helical superstructures from metal clusters remains mysterious and challenging. Here, we achieved hierarchically assembled helical bowties with micrometer scale via electrostatic interaction-driven co-assembly of chiral Au4clusters andtrans-1,4-cyclohexanediamine. The size and conformation matching of chiral Au4andtrans-1,4-cyclohexanediamine compared to the other amines promotes continuous chirality transfer from Au4to nanoplatelets and finally to helical microbowties that follows Au4molecular chirality. We elucidated hierarchical evolution mechanism of morphology from nanoplatelets to microcake and to helical microbowties through gradual helical stacking and twisting of nanoplatelets. Furthermore, these helical microbowties exhibited excellent switchable photoluminescence and circularly polarized luminescence characteristics governed by dissociation and recombination of electrostatic interactions. This work demonstrates the formation of controllable metal cluster–based helical microbowties and deepens the understanding of chirality transfer and expression at microscale."

Leveraging the photosynthetic activity ofC. reinhardtii, our microalgae-empowered muscle (MAM) constructs exhibited superior contractility and almost three times higher active force generation compared to conventional muscle constructs. MAM showed higher cellular viability and reduced tissue damage, attributed to in situ oxygenation and nutrient supply provided by microalgal photosynthesis. In addition, improved myotube alignment was observed in MAM, which contributed to enhanced force generation. Our findings showcase the potential of photosynthetic microalgae as a functional component in engineered skeletal muscle, offering a solution to longstanding challenges in muscle engineering."

While enabling smaller feature sizes, EUV lithography imposes increasingly stringent requirements on the comprehensive performance and stochastic defect suppression of photoresist. The widely recognized strategy to minimize these defects is a material that integrates high EUV absorption and energy utilization into a homogeneous system based on molecular building blocks—the ideal formulation for EUV photoresist. However, achieving these integrated characteristics within a single molecule has remained an unresolved challenge.

This polymeric photoresist, operating through a main chain scission mechanism, demonstrates high-performance positive-tone lithography. Attributed to this ideal formulation, our photoresist achieves a comprehensive 18-nm line width at a dose of 13.1 mJ/cm2with a line edge roughness of 1.97 nm.

Tropical dry forests (TDFs), in particular, are key ecosystems for unraveling the mechanisms driving phenological dynamics, given their crucial role in biodiversity conservation and carbon balance. Although phenological research has advanced rapidly in recent decades in tandem with new methodological innovations, TDFs remain underrepresented. Consequently, the extent to which recent approaches have improved our understanding of leaf changes is still poorly understood. Here, we conducted a comprehensive literature review of phenology in seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTFs) in the Neotropics using Web of Science and Scopus databases up to December 2024. We aimed to synthesize methodological advances, environmental drivers, and functional traits related to phenology, providing insights about mechanisms underlying phenological shifts in Neotropical SDTFs. We documented a significant expansion in phenology research in Neotropical SDTFs over the last decade, with a concentration of studies in South America, particularly Brazil, followed by Central America. Despite these advances, long-term studies remain scarce, limiting our ability to detect interannual variability and long-term trends. The integration of high-resolution monitoring tools, such as phenocameras, has enhanced data collection across spatial and temporal scales, improving our ability to track phenological changes. Furthermore, plant functional traits such as wood density and leaf characteristics associated with deciduousness are key for understanding drought adaptation strategies in dry forests. Given the strong dependence of SDTFs phenological patterns on climate variability, predictive models that incorporate phenological observations, plant functional traits, and climate data will be further crucial for refining our understanding of adaptive mechanisms and improving forecasts of vegetation responses in dry forests.

 Reversed eutrophication, called oligotrophication, has been widely documented globally over the last 30 years in rivers, lakes, and estuaries. However, the absence of a comprehensive and harmonized dataset has hindered a deeper understanding of its ecological consequences. To address this data gap, we developed the OLIGOTREND database, which contains multi-decadal time series of chlorophyll a, nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), and related physicochemical parameters, totalling 4.3 million observations. These data originate from 1894 unique monitoring locations across estuaries (n = 238), lakes (687), and rivers (969). Most time series cover the period from 1986–2022 and comprise at least 15 years of chlorophyll a observations. Each location is associated with catchment and hydroclimatic attributes. Trend and breakpoint analyses were applied to all time series. Chlorophyll a showed temporally variable and ecosystem-specific responses to nutrient declines with an overall declining trend for 18 % of the time series, contrasting greatly with a majority of declining trends for nutrient concentrations.

An integrated hourly charging behavior optimization model for charging costs or emissions relying on a large carsharing reservation database is showcased for Switzerland, revealing a strong trade-off between electricity prices and CO2 emissions. Price-responsive electric charging reduces charging costs by 27% compared to emission-responsive charging, which reduces e-mobility-related CO2 emissions by 82%. Introducing a dynamic carbon tariff could make emission-responsive charging economically rational, resulting in an average carbon price of EUR 0.3/kg CO2-equivalent. Although carsharing hinders battery charging at times of low emissions and requires increased overnight charging, carsharing only leads to minimal differences in operational costs or charging emissions compared to privately owned cars.

After filtration, the pore size of both membranes decreased and the surface zeta potential became more negative. The adsorption of PFAS in the S/S membranes was significantly greater than that of the L/L membranes; electrostatic interaction of PFAS with positively charged overcompensated PVAm was the key contribution.

Herein, an acid-modified Zr-MOF, UiO-67, supported Pd catalyst was synthesized and optimized as an example to explore the influence mechanism of impurity gases (H2O and CO) on o-xylene degradation intermediates. It was found that the impurity gases had a great influence on the generation of Cl-containing byproducts, which formed due to the presence of residual Cl in the frameworks. Meanwhile, the influence mechanism was experimentally and theoretically studied. It was revealed that the introduction of H2O weakened the formation of energy barriers for Cl-containing byproduct generation, resulting in the spontaneous generation of Cl-containing byproducts.

However, achieving direct oxidation removal of Hg0 in a reducing atmosphere at ambient temperature presents a significant challenge. In this study, we designed a Cu-doped OMS-2 sorbent, synthesized with citric acid (CA) assistance, which demonstrated exceptional Hg0 removal performance in simulated natural gas at ambient temperature. The sorbent achieved 97.0% Hg0 removal efficiency under a space velocity of 72 × 104 h–1 when the CA ratio was 0.05. As a carboxyl-rich organic complexing and reducing agent, CA promoted the introduction and dispersion of Cu ions, thereby forming more Mn–O–Cu units. The resulting charge transfer of Mn–O–Cu units further facilitated oxygen vacancy (Ov) formation and lattice oxygen (Olatt) activation, promoting the transformation of gaseous H2S into polysulfide (Sn2–) species. The accumulation of electrons around active Sn2– groups accelerated electron transfer with Hg0 via an Eley–Rideal mechanism.

In this study, pregnant mice were orally administered corn oil (control) or varying doses of DBP via gavage from gestational day 12. The results demonstrated that prenatal DBP exposure induced premature aging in the hippocampus and hypothalamus of male offspring during adolescence and led to a cognitive decline in adulthood. In vitro analyses further showed that monobutyl phthalate (MBP), the principal DBP metabolite, promotes senescence in both HT22 hippocampal and GT1–7 GnRH neuronal cells by activating NF-κB signaling. Notably, the pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB using BAY 11-7082 significantly mitigated this senescence. This study provides the first evidence linking maternal DBP exposure to accelerated brain aging and precocious puberty in offspring, establishing a foundation for investigating DBP’s role in aging-related toxicity."

Folic acid (FA) supplementation enhances one-carbon metabolism (OCM), thus promoting arsenic methylation and facilitating urinary arsenic elimination. Here, we investigate the metabolic profiles linked to arsenic exposure and metabolism based on a FA clinical trial. Arsenic exposure was assessed by the concentrations of blood arsenic (bAs) species: arsenite [InAsIII], arsenate [InAsV], monomethyl- [MMA], and dimethyl- [DMA] arsenicals. Arsenic metabolism was assessed by the relative distribution (%) of these arsenicals in urine. Nontargeted metabolomic profiling was analyzed by LC-HRMS. OCM-related metabolites were analyzed by HPLC/MS/MS. Metabolomic profiling identified 8 unique metabolites and 812 metabolomic features (FDR < 0.05) associated with bAs (predominantly AsV), and 66 metabolites and 285 metabolomic features with %uAs (predominantly %uInAs). Metabolic pathways enriched for bAs and %uAs were similar, highlighting phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis. A FA-induced %uInAs change was associated with four metabolites, three of which share links to acetyl-CoA metabolism. Of 11 measured OCM metabolites, cystathionine was positively associated with all bAs species. Methionine, S-adenosylmethionine, S-adenosylhomocysteine, cysteine, choline, betaine, and dimethylglycine were associated with increased As methylation profiles in urine (FDR < 0.05).

Metal oxide-mediated hydrolysis of contaminants under limited surface moisture conditions has attracted increasing attention due to its similarity to the natural soil environment. While the nonaqueous catalytic hydrolysis mechanisms differ significantly among varying metal oxides, this warrants further investigation to gain a new understanding of these processes. In this study, the nano-ZnO, exposed to atmospheric humidity conditions, exhibited strong surface basicity (pH > 9.0). It performed extremely strong catalytic hydrolysis activity on chloramphenicol (CAP) antibiotic, achieving a half-life of 3.3 h at the optimal surface moisture content (∼2.9 wt %), which is 7–347 times faster than previously reported acid-catalytic processes by other minerals. A novel nonaqueous catalytic hydrolysis mechanism is proposed, namely, the hydrogen-bond-assisted base catalysis by synergistic effects of surface lattice oxygen and ≡Zn–OH. Hydrogen-bonding significantly reduced the hydrolysis activation energy of base-catalysis. The drought nano-ZnO also demonstrated superior catalytic hydrolytic activities to other contaminants and showed effectiveness in actual soil, suggesting its unignorable environmental implications. This study highlights the superior catalytic hydrolysis activity of the engineered nano-ZnO released into field soil and adds new understanding about the nonaqueous catalytic hydrolysis mechanisms and processes in natural soil."

In this study, we explored epitranscriptomic-driven metabolic reprogramming using keratinocyte transformation models established by environmentally relevant arsenite exposure. Our results identified an elevated intracellular taurine concentration as a metabolic reprogramming hallmark of arsenite-induced transformation of keratinocytes, which was validated in mouse models and human samples. Upregulated taurine transporter SLC6A6 facilitated taurine uptake, promoting the arsenic-induced transformation. Mechanically, SLC6A6-mediated taurine uptake enhanced oxidative phosphorylation by upregulating mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase II (MT-CO2), supporting the energy requirements of the arsenic-induced transformation. Notably, this taurine uptake also enhanced MT-CO2-dependent copper utilization, thereby sensitizing arsenite-transformed keratinocytes to copper-dependent and oxidative-phosphorylation-driven metabolic cell death, known as cuproptosis. Furthermore, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase METTL3 catalyzed m6A modifications at multiple sites on SLC6A6 mRNA, promoting the stability and translation of SLC6A6 mRNA by recruiting m6A binding protein YTHDF1 during arsenite-induced transformation. In conclusion, our results suggest that taurine uptake, mediated by m6A-methylated SLC6A6, promotes arsenite-induced malignant transformation while enhancing sensitivity to cuproptosis in arsenite-transformed keratinocytes. This study reveals novel RNA epigenetic mechanisms driving arsenic-induced transformation through metabolic reprogramming, offering valuable insights for environmental health risk assessment and potential intervention strategies."

However, their specific role in the development of adverse health effects related to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure remains insufficiently understood. In this study, we used both mouse models and cultured cells to document their role in the development of pulmonary inflammation due to exposure to diesel exhaust particles (DEP), the main component of urban PM2.5. The results revealed that DEP induced pulmonary inflammation as well as an acute phase response in the lung and liver within 24 h, which gradually diminished over the subsequent week. Depletion of alveolar macrophages alleviated the DEP-induced pulmonary inflammation and acute phase response. Furthermore, this study showed that Msr1 may be the primary receptor responsible for the phagocytosis of DEP in macrophages, while the PIP2-mediated nonbiological phagocytic signaling pathway appeared to be nonsignificant.

The dissipation half-lives of R- and S-paclobutrazol were 30.7 and 40.7 d, and interconversion between the two enantiomers occurred in soils. Nine previously unreported TPs were identified, and one was synthesized and confirmed with an authentic standard.

Environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs), long-lived in particulate matter, may promote HONO formation via reactions with NO2, although the mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated. In this study, the heterogeneous formation of HONO was explored through reactions between NO2 and diesel soot collected during a field campaign, focusing on the role of EPFRs. EPFRs in diesel soot, primarily composed of carbon-centered radicals (CCRs) within the elemental carbon (EC), were present at 5.40 × 1018 ± 9.60 × 1018 spins·m–3. The combination of CCRs in EC with NO2 to form surface nitro compounds (RONO) was initially observed and served as the rate-limiting step. Furthermore, the photolysis of carboxyl compounds (ROOH) in organic carbon (OC) generated •OH, which reacted with RONO to enhance HONO formation. Gradient RH experiments revealed that H2O facilitates HONO formation by enhancing NO2 adsorption or acting as an •OH donor. The results indicate that, in typical urban environments, besides HCHO photolysis, EPFRs in diesel soot significantly contribute to HONO formation, playing a major role in •OH production with a rate of ∼106 molecules·cm–3·s–1 at RH 40–60% under vehicle-related EPFR concentrations (∼1013 spins·m–3, observed in Xi’an, China).

In this study, we hypothesized that cosmetics may contain previously unidentified thyroid-disrupting chemicals. To evaluate this possibility, we compiled a comprehensive data set of cosmetic ingredients and developed a random forest regression-based machine learning model to predict their potential to disrupt thyroid hormone receptor β (TRβ), a critical regulator of thyroid function. From the top 40 compounds ranked by the model, 12 frequently used cosmetic ingredients were selected for experimental validation. Of these, six demonstrated measurable binding affinity toward TRβ. Notably, Vat Blue 6 (VB6), a colorant utilized in cosmetic formulations, exhibited structural characteristics potentially mimicking thyroid hormones and displayed potent TRβ binding with an affinity (Kd) as low as 0.7 μM. Subsequent in vitro assays and in vivo experiments in mice confirmed VB6’s thyroid-disrupting effects, evidenced by dose-dependent reductions in serum thyroid hormone concentrations and morphological alterations of thyroid tissue.

All PSNPs aggregated in inflammatory artificial lysosomal fluid (ALF), whereas bare- and carboxyl-modified PSNPs remained stable in healthy Gamble’s solution (GS) and modified GS (MGS). Aggregation of PSNPs in ALF and GS followed the classical Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek theory, while steric hindrance and hydrogen bonding between PSNPs and the lung surfactant governed the aggregation in MGS. Furthermore, redundancy analysis indicated that the aggregation of PSNPs reduced oxidative stress and membrane damage to bacteria in lung fluids. Specifically, amino-modified PSNPs, which aggregated in GS, could induce sustained oxidative stress, damage the cell membrane of native pulmonary bacteria, and promote the release of pyoverdine from pathogenic bacteria up to 2.16 times.

Harrison,Traffic-Emitted Amines Promote New Particle Formation at Roadsides,"New particle formation (NPF) is a major source of atmospheric aerosol particles, significantly influencing particle number concentrations in urban environments. High condensation and coagulation sinks at highly trafficked roadside sites should suppress NPF due to the low survival probability of clusters and new particles, however, observations show that roadside NPF is frequent and intense. Here, we investigate NPF at an urban background and roadside site in Central Europe using simultaneous measurements of sulfuric acid, amines, highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs), and particle number size distributions. We demonstrate that sulfuric acid and amines, particularly traffic-derived C2-amines, are the primary participants in particle formation. C2-amine concentrations at the roadside are enhanced by over a factor of 4 relative to the background, overcoming the effect of enhanced coagulation and condensation sinks. Using machine learning we identify a further but uncertain enhancing role of HOMs. These findings reveal the critical role of traffic emissions in urban NPF."

However, GUV222 also generates ozone (O3), posing human health risks and initiating additional photochemistry that may degrade indoor air quality. Air cleaners present an opportunity to counteract the drawbacks of GUV222 by removing harmful byproducts; however, to our knowledge, this has never been demonstrated. Here, we conduct laboratory experiments in a 7.5 m3 Teflon chamber using two commercially available air cleaners─a manganese-oxide-catalyst “ozone cleaner” and an activated-carbon-HEPA “volatile organic compound (VOC) + particulate matter (PM) cleaner”─each simultaneously with a GUV222 lamp. We show that both cleaner types remove a wide range of key pollutants, including O3, NO2, formaldehyde, VOCs, and particles. Application of chamber results to a photochemical model simulating chemistry in a 150 m3 room suggests that a single cleaner can achieve modest reductions in O3 levels and substantial reductions in secondary pollutant levels within typical indoor environments. These results indicate that indoor air pollutants from GUV222 can be mitigated through the use of air cleaning technology, thereby improving indoor air quality while maximizing the potential benefit of germicidal UV for human health."

First, we find an overall increase of heat extreme frequency in the NH continents in our model simulations, but only in the presence of ocean‐atmosphere coupling. The increased frequency of heat extremes is entirely due to mean temperature increase. However, in comparison to the corresponding future warming scenario, in general, increases in heat extremes in NH continents due to the future Arctic sea ice loss are relatively small.

Here, we use a thermodynamic systems approach, and show that DTR primarily reflects changes in lower atmospheric heat storage, governed by diurnally constrained non‐latent energy input from the surface into the atmospheric boundary layer. This approach predicts DTR across a range of climates, reproduces its day‐to‐day variations, and explains its decline with rising greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations. We show that in addition to strong controls exerted by radiation and cloud cover, DTR carries imprints of surface water stress during the water‐limited evaporative regime. Our expression yields a mean reduction of 0.23°C in DTR per 1°C rise in temperatures, in response to changes in GHG forcings. Our findings imply that the first‐order decline in DTR with global warming can be explained by increased GHG forcings alone."

By systematically comparing the compositions of ∼120 Ma VGBs with those of ancient Apollo VGBs, we propose a distinctive metasomatized mantle source characterized by low‐Ti but enriched in Na2O, K2O, and incompatible trace elements. Modeling of multiple saturation points suggests an olivine‐orthopyroxene‐dominated mantle source partially molten at 7.7–15.2 kbar and 1,387–1,448°C. The metasomatism of highly evolved ∼2.0 Ga Chang'e‐5 basalt in the mantle source is the most plausible scenario for the unique composition of ∼120 Ma VGBs.

While the coupling via VMM is active on the ocean mesoscales around O (100 km), large coherent SST fronts can support such coupling to span over scales larger than 500 km. We find that VMM operates on a wider range of temporal scales than previously thought. In particular, VMM is active not only on monthly but also on daily timescales, and is even present on hourly timescales.

A day‐long microstructure survey from drifting ice that traversed an anticyclone in summer shows rotating shear and straining in the halocline, resulting in low Richardson number layers coincident with turbulent patches and gradients in oxygen and chlorophyll. Year‐long data from an adjacent mooring demonstrate that increased shear variance can be related to upward‐propagating wave energy, generated by tidal forcing at the seafloor and amplified by mesoscale shear near the surface. These waves contain compound tides and overtones with spectral peaks at 3 and 4 cycles per day. Mesoscale variability modulates internal wave shear, influencing turbulent mixing and ecosystem dynamics.

Each of the first three (higher‐altitude) collisions was associated with luminosity waves originating from the collision point, including an upward reflection‐type wave along the colliding leader channel and one or more transmitted waves along the residual branches of the preceding stroke. Based on the estimated extension speeds and RF field signatures, we attributed the transmitted luminosity waves to dart‐stepped leaders developing in shorter segments of the decayed channel. As a result of the last collision, at a height of 90 m above ground level, a branch of the Stroke 2 leader entered the lower part of the residual (nonluminous) Stroke 1 channel and connected to the ground, producing a return stroke. Additionally, the heavily branched Stroke 2 leader created a ground termination about 950 m away from its ground termination common with Stroke 1. We observed four X‐ray pulses of unknown origin with peaks ranging from 130 to 750 keV during a 3.5‐ms or so interval around the time of the higher‐altitude collisions during the leader stage of Stroke 2, but no detectable X‐ray pulses during the leader stages of Strokes 1 and 3.

Shields,Regional and Temporal Variability of Atmospheric River Seasonality: Influences of Detection Algorithms and Moisture Transport Dynamics,"Understanding the regional and temporal variability of atmospheric river (AR) seasonality is crucial for preparedness and mitigation of extreme events. While ARs were thought to peak in winter, recent research shows they exhibit region‐specific seasonality and are heavily influenced by the chosen detection algorithm. This study examines the link between the year‐to‐year consistency of peak‐AR activity to the presence of a dominant seasonal pattern, considering both location and algorithm choice. Regions are categorized by their temporal characteristics: consistent patterns (e.g., East Asia), patterns with occasional outliers (e.g., British Columbia coast), and regions lacking a clear dominant peak season (e.g., South Atlantic, parts of Australia). Hence, not all regions display a consistent seasonal cycle of AR activity. This study quantifies the extent to which a region experiences a dominant peak season of AR activity (or lacks one) and offers insights to enhance decision‐making in water management, natural hazard preparedness, and forecasting. Furthermore, given our finding that detection algorithms influence the peak season of AR activity, we also examine two diagnostic variables representative of moisture transport to corroborate our results. Integrated vapor transport, which captures meridional and zonal moisture transport, and Moist Wave Activity, representing moisture intrusions from lower to higher latitudes, are examined. Our analysis indicates that inconsistencies in the seasonal cycle of AR activity are not solely due to discrepancies in detection algorithms but also arise from changes in moisture transport."

Our findings suggest that the combined influence of local SST warming and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) events can account for a substantial portion of historical meridional SST gradients (SSTG) in the Bay of Bengal (BOB), and thus contribute to the ISMR anomalies over Central India, Northeast India, and the northwestern GMS. The meridional SSTG in the BOB exert oceanic feedback on the atmosphere by modulating anomalous planetary boundary layer winds via the sea level pressure adjustment mechanism, vertical momentum mixing mechanism, and the thermal wind mechanism. The evolution of deep convection aligns with that of the meridional SSTG, thereby intensifying the downward transport occurred over the BOB north of 15°N and the upward transport occurred over the near‐equator BOB. Both the temperature and pressure anomalies contribute to the anomalous easterlies at 850 and 500 hPa, and thus leads to the significant weakening of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM). Numerical experiments provide robust evidence supporting the proposed modulating influence of the meridional SSTG on the reduction of ISM rainfall over the BOB.

 Climate change has significantly increased adverse effects on human health, and economic growth1–3. However, few studies have differentiated the impacts of extreme temperatures at the city level, and analysed the future implications for human health under various climate change scenarios.4–6 Here, data on historical relationship among six kinds of climate-sensitive diseases (CSD) hospitalizations and temperatures across 301 cities (over 90% of all cities) and more than 7,000 hospitals in China are leveraged, and a nonlinear distributed lag model is used. This study projects hospitalization risks associated with extreme temperatures through to the year 2100 and develops the Hospitalization Burden Economic Index to assess the burden under three carbon emission scenarios in cities. Five dimensions including spatial distribution, disease categories, population age groups, future time horizons, and carbon emission development pathways have been evaluated. Historical data specifically indicate more temperature-related risks among the CSDs in northwestern and southwestern China. Notably, gestation-related disease risk is associated with increased vulnerability to extreme heat in specific regions. The projections reveal that, under current thermal conditions with no adaptations, the excess hospitalizations from extreme heat will reach 5.1 million people by 2100 under the high emission scenario.These findings highlight the need for targeted climate change mitigation strategies to reduce uneven climate-related hospitalization risks and economic burdens while accounting for differences in city geography, extreme temperatures, population groups and carbon emission development pathways."

 Quantifying climate sensitivity is essential for future climate projections, yet it varies with major Earth system changes. We present a glacial CO₂ reconstruction using paleosols from the Chinese Loess Plateau, covering 2580 to 800 thousand years ago. A stepwise decline in glacial CO₂ levels from ~300 ppm to <200 ppm is observed. Our paleosol-based CO₂ estimates support the key role of atmospheric CO₂ in driving major climate transitions during the Pleistocene, such as the long-term global cooling and the amplification of the glacial cycles. Based on compiled glacial and interglacial CO2 records, Earth system sensitivity, defined as the global temperature change for a doubling of CO2 once the whole Earth system has reached equilibrium, is estimated to be ~6.2–7.4 K (3.2–12.0 K, 95% confidence). Equilibrium climate sensitivity, after accounting for the different efficacy between ice-sheet and CO2 forcing and other slow feedbacks, is estimated to be 3.3 K (2.1–6.3 K, 95% confidence) and 3.7 K (1.7–6.3 K, 95% confidence), respectively. The lack of a significant difference between these values suggests no apparent state-dependency of climate sensitivity between glacial and interglacial climate states.

 Macrophages play vital roles in innate and adaptive immunity, and their functions are mediated via phagocytosis and antigen presentation. Despite the effort to identify phagocytic checkpoints and explore their mechanism of action, current checkpoint-scanning strategies cannot provide a complete and systematic list of such immune checkpoints. Here, we perform in vitro phagocytosis assays using primary healthy donor macrophages co-cultured with breast cancer cells followed by ribosome profiling of sorted macrophages, to identify immune system-specific checkpoints. We observe a downregulation of CD37 in phagocytic macrophages and demonstrate that targeting CD37 with a specific antibody promotes the phagocytosis of multiple cancer cells in vitro. Mechanistically, tumorous macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) directly binds to CD37, promoting the phosphorylation of CD37Y13 and activating a transduction cascade that involves the recruitment of SHP1 and inhibition of AKT signaling, ultimately impairing phagocytosis. In vivo, targeting CD37 promotes tumor clearance in multiple preclinical mouse models and synergizes with anti-CD47 therapy. Thus, our study identifies a previously unidentified phagocytic checkpoint and provides new potential for precise therapy. Cancer cells evade the immune system by disrupting phagocytic clearance.

However, understanding the relationship between local and long-range connectivity is essential for studying both healthy and pathological conditions of the brain.

 Traditional wearable ultrasound devices pose challenges concerning the rigidity and environmental impact of lead-based piezoelectric materials. This study proposes a silicon nanocolumn capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (snCMUT) array for real-time wearable ultrasound imaging in disposable patches. Using a lead-free design, snCMUT incorporates silicon nanocolumns to address existing issues and achieves high transmission efficiency (220 kPa/V), flexibility, and low power consumption. The specialized structure of snCMUT enhances displacement efficiency, enabling high-resolution imaging while maintaining a thin, flexible form factor (~900 μm). Phantom imaging demonstrates its superior performance, with high axial and lateral resolutions (0.52 and 0.55 mm) and depth penetration (~70 mm) at low voltage (8.9 VPP).

 Somatostatin-expressing (SST) interneurons modulate hemodynamic responses both directly and indirectly, but their precise role remains unclear. Here, we investigated the influence of SST interneurons on hemodynamic control in response to optogenetic stimulation of SST neurons and somatosensory stimulation in both awake and anesthetized mice. Prolonged optogenetic stimulation of SST neurons induces fast vasodilation through nitric oxide synthase-expressing neurons that co-express SST, and slow vasodilation mediated by astrocytes. Similar neurovascular coupling mechanisms are observed during prolonged sensory stimulation, which also induces both fast and delayed vasodilation. The delayed vasodilation, mediated by the SST neuron-astrocyte pathway, enhances the specificity of cerebral blood volume (CBV)-weighted fMRI signals to cortical layer 4, as confirmed by chemogenetic inhibition of SST neurons. Our findings indicate that the SST neuron-astrocyte-vascular pathway shapes hemodynamic responses to prolonged stimulation and is critical for achieving high-specificity, laminar-resolution fMRI, which is increasingly pursued in human cognitive studies.

 Local climate information is crucial for impact assessment and decision-making, yet coarse global climate simulations cannot capture small-scale phenomena. Current statistical downscaling methods infer these phenomena as temporally decoupled spatial patches. However, to preserve physical properties, estimating spatio-temporally coherent high-resolution weather dynamics for multiple variables across long time horizons is crucial. We present a novel generative framework that uses a score-based diffusion model trained on high-resolution reanalysis data to capture the statistical properties of local weather dynamics. After training, we condition on coarse climate model data to generate weather patterns consistent with the aggregate information. As this predictive task is inherently uncertain, we leverage the probabilistic nature of diffusion models and sample multiple trajectories. We evaluate our approach with high-resolution reanalysis information before applying it to the climate model downscaling task. We then demonstrate that the model generates spatially and temporally coherent weather dynamics that align with global climate output."

 The decomposition of recalcitrant organic matter (ROM) in seagrass litter plays a crucial role in mediating blue carbon magnitude. However, the mechanisms underlying ROM decomposition in seagrass litter under eutrophication, driven by anthropogenic pressures, remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effects of eutrophication on the decomposition of two types of seagrass litter (leaf and sheath) through laboratory experiments adding nitrogen and macroalgae. We found that macroalgae addition inhibited ROM breakdown in leaves and sheaths. Nitrogen addition enhanced ROM decomposition in leaves by 4% while suppressing it in sheaths compared to the treatments without nitrogen addition. Additionally, the combined addition of nitrogen and macroalgae led to a more substantial loss of sheath ROM (35-39%) compared with macroalgae alone. The opposite response of ROM breakdown in leaf and sheath under nitrogen addition were co-regulated by litter quality and bacteria taxa (i.e., Flavobacteriales, Actinomarinales, and Phycisphaerales). In the presence of macroalgae, fungi, including Lecythophora luteoviridis, Tyrannosorus hystrioides, and Pseudeurotium_ovale, were found to play a significant role in the decomposition of leaf ROM, but not in sheath decomposition. These findings highlight the negative effects of eutrophication on litter ROM sequestration and the important role that litter quality and microbe play.

 Tropical cyclones can cause severe damage to coastal communities and the marine industry. However, trends in their intensity remain uncertain due to observational challenges, especially for the more frequent weak tropical cyclones, defined as tropical storms to category-1 tropical cyclones on the Saffir–Simpson scale. Here we develop an inversion model using surface drifter observations to estimate sea-surface wind speed, aiming to reassess the long-term global trend in the intensity of weak tropical cyclones from 1993 to 2022.

 We report unequivocal evidence of seagrasses preserved in radiometrically constrained sediments (20.5 Ma) from Patagonia (Gaiman Formation), substantially extending their known palaeogeographic distribution. The new morphospecies Thalassotaenia notophyllum sp. nov. was erected based on well-preserved leaf blades that exhibit characters phylogenetically close to the genus Thalassia (Hydrocharitaceae), today distributed predominantly in tropical regions. Exquisitely preserved epibionts—diatoms, bryozoans, polychaetes, and coralline algae—occurred on these Miocene leaves, indicating that seagrass-dominated ecosystems were well established at high South American latitudes. Our finding implies that average sea surface temperatures in Patagonian coastal waters during the early Miocene were substantially warmer than today. The warm conditions are also supported by the presence of marine and terrestrial palynomorphs recovered from the seagrass-bearing sediments. Since seagrass ecosystems rank amongst the most important natural carbon sinks on earth, our discovery from Patagonia provides evidence that the wider past extension of seagrasses may have had a more important role in the Cenozoic carbon cycle than previously thought.

 Important aspects concerning the origin and formation of the Moon’s exosphere, its tenuous gas envelope, remain puzzling with uncertainties regarding the importance of different effects. Two competing processes — micrometeoroid impact vaporization and solar wind ion sputtering — are considered key contributors to the ejection of particles into the exosphere. Here we present direct, high-precision yield measurements of solar wind ion sputtering using real lunar samples (Apollo 16 sample 68501), combined with advanced 3D simulations of regolith erosion. We find solar wind sputter yields up to an order of magnitude lower than previously used in exosphere models. The difference is primarily due to the suppressive effects of surface morphology, in particular the roughness and high porosity of the lunar regolith. Our results provide critical, experimentally validated sputter yield estimates and address long-standing modeling uncertainties. These results are particularly timely in light of upcoming and ongoing missions, such as the Artemis program at the Moon or BepiColombo at Mercury, contributing essentially to our understanding of how the surfaces of rocky bodies in the solar system are altered.

 The Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH) posits that higher spectral diversity indicates higher biodiversity, which would allow imaging spectroscopy to be used in biodiversity assessment and monitoring. However, its applicability varies due to ecological and methodological factors. Key methodological factors impacting spectral diversity metrics include spatial resolution, shadow removal, and spectral transformations. This study investigates how these methodological considerations affect the application of the SVH across ecosystems and sites. Using field and hyperspectral data from forest and open (e.g., wetland, grassland, savannah) ecosystems from five sites of the Canadian Airborne Biodiversity Observatory (CABO), we analyzed three variance-based spectral diversity metrics across and within vegetation sites, examining the effects of illumination corrections, spatial resolution, and shadow filtering on the spectral-plant functional diversity relationship. Our findings highlight that the relationship between spectral diversity metrics and functional diversity are strongly influenced by methods, especially spectral transformations. These illumination corrections notably impacted the spectral regions of importance and the resulting relationships to plant functional diversity. Depending on methodological choices, we observed correlations that varied not only in strength but also direction: in open vegetation we saw negative correlations when using brightness normalization, and positive correlations when using continuum removal. Shadow removal and spatial resolution were important but had less impact on the correlations. By systematically analyzing these methodological aspects, our study not only aims to guide researchers through potential challenges in SVH studies but also highlights the inherent sensitivity of spectral-functional diversity relationships to methodological choices. The variability and context-dependence of these relationships across and within sites emphasize the need for adaptable, site-specific approaches, presenting a key challenge in developing robust methods to enhance biodiversity monitoring and conservation strategies."

 Accurate monitoring of plant nutrient status, especially nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) content, via remote sensing can facilitate precision forestry, with environmental and management benefits. In previous studies, plant traits derived from hyperspectral data via radiative transfer models (RTMs) and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) effectively explained the observed variability in leaf N concentrations in crops. However, their contribution to leaf P concentration is unknown. Furthermore, such an approach might not be transferrable to coniferous stands, which are structurally complex and heterogeneous. We evaluated the potential of using physiological plant traits derived from airborne hyperspectral imagery to explain the observed variability in needle N and P concentrations in Pinus radiata D. Don (radiata pine) with four datasets collected over three years in established nutrient trials. RTM-derived data on pigment content in needles, including chlorophyll a + b (Cab), carotenoid (Car), and anthocyanin contents (Anth), as well as SIF quantified at the O2A absorption band (SIF760), explained variability in N (R2 = 0.67–0.97 and NRMSE = 0.07–0.30) and P concentrations (R2 = 0.60–0.95 and NRMSE = 0.09–0.27) in needles. Although Cab was the most important predictor of needle N concentration (ranking Cab > Anth > SIF760 > Car), SIF760 contributed the most to explain the variability of needle P concentration (SIF760 > Anth > Cab > Car). Moreover, the blue spectral region was essential for assessing P but not for explaining N variability in needles. Among all reflectance-based indices and inverted traits evaluated, the blue indices best explained the variability in needle P concentration, followed by Cab, Car, and Anth. The study revealed the distinct contribution of far-red SIF vs. the blue spectral region for needle P compared to needle N, describing new insights for the physiological assessment of nutrient levels in forest stands using hyperspectral imagery."

In this study, we provide a statistical explanation, demonstrating that the Poisson distribution, and the exponential waiting time derived from it, the uniform distribution, and CSR are all mathematically equivalent under the same probabilistic framework. We present interpretations from both a simulation algorithm perspective and a statistical sampling perspective, supported by appropriate statistical reasoning. Our ecology-oriented discussion aims to clarify the conceptual confusion surrounding CSR and establish a coherent link to foundational knowledge in spatial ecology. Ultimately, we hope to deepen ecologists’ and biologists’ understandings of species distribution patterns and support future developments of distributional ecology."

 Continuous winter cover on croplands reduces soil erosion and enhances soil organic carbon, making it essential for climate-smart agriculture and greenhouse gas mitigation. However, spatially and temporally explicit data on winter cropland cover remain limited across Europe. We present a national-scale assessment of winter cropland cover in Germany from 2017 to 2023 using spectral unmixing-derived fractional cover time series from Sentinel-2 and Landsat imagery. Four winter cover types were distinguished: winter crops, green cover (including cover crops and spontaneous vegetation), residue cover, and no cover (bare soil). Phenological metrics were derived for green cover to assess vegetation duration, biomass accumulation, and termination type.Our results reveal an increasing share of green cover, rising from 17 % in 2017/18 to 21 % in 2022/23, and a decline in bare soil from 20 % to 12 %, indicating a shift toward more protective winter management. Green cover was most frequent in northwestern and southern Germany, while bare soil remained prevalent in central and eastern regions. Classification results showed good agreement with Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) parcel-level records of winter cover crops (F1-Score = 0.68) and agricultural census data at the federal state level (R2 = 0.82, MAE = 5 percentage points). Remote sensing estimates consistently exceeded reported cover crop shares, reflecting the presence of non-subsidized or spontaneous vegetation. Our approach provides valuable input for enhanced erosion and carbon modeling and establishes a basis for monitoring and future evaluation of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) instruments, including Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions (GAEC) standards."

 Rock glaciers are debris landforms formed by long-term creep of ice-rich permafrost. Their kinematics provide critical insights for climate change and permafrost studies, mountain hydrology, and hazard assessment. Previous studies have measured rock glacier velocities using field-based terrestrial geodetic surveys, repeat photogrammetry, and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR). However, these methods have typically been confined to local regions, leaving the large-scale velocity characteristics underexplored. In this study, we developed a multi-temporal and multi-geometry InSAR framework for systematically generating rock glacier velocity fields. We rigorously validated our approach by comparing the InSAR-derived velocities with those derived from very-high-resolution optical imagery (Pléiades satellite imagery and aerial imagery) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements. The mean relative difference is approximately 20 % when compared to velocities from Pléiades and aerial images, increasing to 50 % for GNSS point measurements. Applying our method, we produced the first large-scale regional rock glacier velocity dataset, encompassing downslope velocity fields for 19,727 previously inventoried rock glaciers in the Tibet-Pamir-Karakoram region. We found a velocity contrast between different climatic domains: rock glaciers in the westerlies domain move on average faster (median = 30 cm/yr) than those in the monsoon domain (median = 13 cm/yr). Our study presents a methodological framework for assessing rock glacier velocities using InSAR and demonstrates its capability for large-scale applications. This approach can be readily adapted to other regions worldwide to support the assessment and monitoring of rock glacier dynamics in a changing climate."

 Delineating clear scene boundaries in remote sensing images remains a challenge despite their ability to visually present landscapes. This study introduces a novel Scene Boundary Visual Perception (SBVP) method designed to identify scene boundaries in remote sensing images that conform to human visual perception. SBVP first computes the image’s average state as a fundamental unit for perception, guiding upscaling segmentation for initial scene targets and superpixel segmentation for object-level refinement. The hypothesis that the average state of the image scene can effectively guide upscaling segmentation and superpixel segmentation was tested on 16 large-scale remote sensing images with varying spatial resolutions and land cover types. SBVP was compared against eCognition and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and further applied to suspicious target detection and the delineation of arid-humid and global biogeographical boundaries. Experimental results validate the hypothesis, showing that SBVP outperforms eCognition and SAM, achieving a mean IoU of 0.90, representing a 20 % and 23 % improvement over eCognition and SAM, respectively (P < 0.01). Additionally, SBVP effectively detects suspicious targets and enhances the delineation of arid-humid and global biogeographical boundaries. As a simple yet effective approach, SBVP provides an automated solution for identifying scene boundaries that closely conform to human visual perception, offering broad applicability in remote sensing and geographic studies."

 While numerous studies have evaluated precipitation products by comparing them with in-situ observations, the suitability of these products for closing the water balance budget in Africa remains largely unexplored. This study assesses the performance of eight latest precipitation products, namely MSWEP v2.8, CRU v4.07, CHIRPS v2.0, ERA5-Land, CPC, NOAH, IMERG v7, and MSWX v1, in closing the water balance budget over Africa. We begin by assessing the general consistency among these precipitation products using rain-gauge measurements and multiple linear regression analysis, followed by the generalized three-corner-hat (GTCH) method applied to estimate the relative uncertainties and signal-to-noise (SNR) ratios of the eight precipitation products, which help identify the potential causes of the water balance non-closure over Africa. To evaluate the suitability for closing the water balance budget, we compare the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on (GRACE-FO, hereafter GRACE) satellite missions’ derived total water storage changes (TWSC) with those of the water balance equation using each precipitation product. The influence of climate zones and terrain on these evaluations is also examined. The results reveal significant discrepancies in precipitation trends among the eight precipitation products. The GTCH analysis indicates that MSWEP achieves the lowest uncertainties and highest SNR values in most cases, followed by MSWX and CHIPRS. Regarding closing the water balance budget, NOAH exhibits the highest consistency with GRACE-derived TWSC than other products, followed by IMERG, whereas CPC achieved the lowest suitability. The performance of these products appears to be more influenced by climatic regimes than by terrain. All precipitation products indicate approximately 20% non-closure in the water balance budget over Africa, likely due to the underestimation of annual signals, as revealed by the principal component analysis (PCA). This study underscores that utilizing precipitation derived from the same data source as runoff and evapotranspiration demonstrates high consistency with GRACE-derived TWSC data. These findings suggest that precipitation estimates should merge multi-source datasets and consider the water balance budget, which can help reduce uncertainties and provide a more reliable foundation for hydrological studies in Africa."

Based on the stratified random sampling ground references, the open-boll cotton field map had a high overall accuracy of 95 % (± 1 %). The starting dates of the open-boll period varied across the southeastern United States, mainly ranging from the day of the year (DOY) 244 to 304 (September and October).

 This paper presents a method for detecting and estimating vehicle speeds using PlanetScope SuperDove satellite imagery, offering a scalable solution for global vehicle traffic monitoring. Conventional methods such as stationary sensors and mobile systems like UAVs are limited in coverage and constrained by high costs and legal restrictions. Satellite-based approaches provide broad spatial coverage, but face challenges, including high costs, low frame rates, and difficulty detecting small vehicles in medium-resolution imagery. We propose a Keypoint R-CNN model to track vehicle trajectories across RGB bands, leveraging band timing differences to estimate speed. Validation is performed using drone footage and GPS data that covers highways in Germany and Poland. Our model achieved a Mean Average Precision of 0.53 and velocity estimation errors of approximately 3.4 m/s compared to GPS data. The results of the drone comparison reveal underestimations, with average speeds of 112.85 km/h for satellite data versus 131.83 km/h from drone footage.

A comprehensive approach was applied, integrating emissions from traffic, road dust resuspension, and residential heating. These emissions were estimated using a bottom-up approach based on detailed road and point source data. The ATMO-Street model chain was employed, combining the GEM-AQ model for background concentrations with the IFDM bi-Gaussian dispersion model and the OSPM street-canyon module. Model validation using data from nine monitoring stations demonstrated that including the OSPM module significantly improved NO2 predictions at the traffic station, enhancing GEM-AQ and IFDM model performance by 62% and 46%, respectively. The results showed that traffic contributes 84% of NO2 concentrations at this location.Furthermore, incorporating the street-canyon effect and resuspension emissions—previously excluded—improved model accuracy for PM2.5 and PM10 by 34% and 55%, respectively, compared to GEM-AQ.

 This study investigates future projections of the extreme Humidex, a compound index integrating air temperature and relative humidity, as an indicator of heat stress under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1–2.6 and SSP5–8.5). Using multi-model ensemble simulations from 15 high-resolution CMIP6 models, we examine seasonal variations in the extreme Humidex at both global and regional scales across 21 land regions. The historical simulations from CMIP6 models were validated using ERA5 observational data, ensuring reliability and accuracy in model projections. Additionally, the climatology of Humidex values derived from MME simulations was compared with the climatology of the Heat Index obtained from MME simulations, revealing consistency between the two heat stress indicators. To quantify heat-related hazards, we calculate the number of seasonal Dangerous Humidex Days (DHDs). Furthermore, we assess the relative contributions of air temperature and relative humidity to projected changes in the extreme Humidex. The results reveal a marked intensification of heat stress under SSP5–8.5, with late-century (2080–2100) increases in the extreme Humidex reaching approximately 5 to 9 °C across most land regions, compared to around 1.5 to 3.5 °C under SSP1–2.6. The JJA season exhibits the greatest intensification, particularly over Eastern North America and Northern Asia. On average, DJF shows a 2.78-fold increase in Humidex anomalies, while JJA demonstrates an even larger amplification of approximately 2.90-fold when transitioning from a low to high-emission scenario. The number of seasonal Dangerous Humidex Days also increases significantly, with an additional 60 to 80 days during DJF across many tropical and subtropical regions of the Southern Hemisphere, and more than 80 additional days per JJA season in most tropical regions under the high-emission scenario. Sensitivity analyses indicate that air temperature is the dominant driver of future changes in the extreme Humidex, while relative humidity exerts a secondary but regionally important influence."

 Evaluating the efficacy of cloud-seeding operations presents a complex challenge in atmospheric science, due to the multifaceted interactions between artificial nuclei, natural cloud processes, and local meteorological conditions. In this study, to assess cloud-seeding effects, several field experiments were conducted at Dongyanshan site (elevation 840 m) in northern Taiwan during northeast monsoon seasons from 2019 to 2022. The experiments utilized hygroscopic cloud seeding, leveraging the site's advantages of well-established instrumentation and a semi-closed, in-cloud environment. Our observational results indicate that the seeding agents can strengthen the competition effect, which causes an increase in liquid water content (LWC) and a decrease in water vapor mixing ratio, as well as the tail effect, which widens the drop size distribution (DSD). This important phenomenon of increased raindrop number concentration after cloud seeding was further confirmed by DSD observations at the upstream neighboring site, Xiayunping (elevation 340 m), where no cloud seeding was executed. Additionally, real-case model simulations were performed to further investigate the microphysical processes of cloud seeding. Simulation results indicate that cloud seeding enhances the cloud activation process (Pcact) while leading to the development of smaller cloud droplets, which decreases the auto-conversion process (Praut) of rain. Concurrently, an intensified accretion process (Pracw) increases raindrop diameter. These findings provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of cloud seeding, potentially improving the design and implementation of future weather modification strategies in similar atmospheric conditions."

Through this glycine-rich intrinsically disordered region (IDR), polyglycine sequesters and depletes the tRNA-LC, disrupting tRNA processing. Accordingly, patient tissues revealed aggregate-associated FAM98B depletion and accumulation of aberrant tRNA splicing intermediates.

However, how this positive feedback is restricted to maintain H3K9me3 homeostasis remains largely unknown. We performed an unbiased genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screen and identified CUL5ASB7E3 ubiquitin ligase as a negative regulator of H3K9me3. ASB7 is recruited to heterochromatin by HP1 and promotes SUV39H1 degradation. During mitosis, cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) phosphorylates ASB7, preventing its interaction with SUV39H1, leading to SUV39H1 stabilization and H3K9me3 restoration. Our findings reveal a dynamic circuit involving HP1, SUV39H1, and ASB7 that governs H3K9me3 homeostasis, ensuring faithful epigenetic inheritance and preventing excessive heterochromatin formation."

A prevalent hypothesis posits that the Arp8 module within INO80 enables a ruler-like activity. Using cryogenic electron microscopy, we show that on nucleosomes with 40 bp of flanking DNA, the Arp8 module rotates 180° away from the DNA. Deleting the Arp8 module enables rapid sliding irrespective of flanking DNA length. Thus, rather than enabling a ruler-like activity, the Arp8 module acts as a brake on INO80 remodeling when flanking DNA is short. This autoinhibition–based mechanism has broad implications for understanding how primitive nucleosome mobilization enzymes may have evolved into sophisticated remodelers."

Pyridine (a six-membered C5N ring) has risen to prominence in discovery chemistry, its ease of assembly spurring further synthetic development. Despite a host of favorable properties, pyridazine (an analogous C4N2ring) has comparatively lagged behind—a discrepancy attributable to its often-challenging preparation, which arises from an electronically dissonant heteroatom arrangement. In this work, we achieve a single-atom skeletal edit that produces pyridazines from pyridines by direct carbon-to-nitrogen atom replacement: Azide introduction at the ortho position enables a photoinitiated rearrangement ofN-amino-2-azidopyridinium cations. This transformation links the two heterocycles such that the richness of pyridine retrosynthesis becomes available to pyridazines."

Mutations in specific cysteine residues of IAA3 disrupt redox-mediated multimerization and interaction with co-repressor TPL, thereby attenuating IAA3-mediated target gene repression. Other AUX/IAA proteins also vary in their redox-mediated multimerization, which reveals a regulatory mechanism that connects dynamic changes in cellular redox status to auxin signaling.

Despite their extensive implementation, long-term evaluations of these practices are limited, especially in data-scarce regions. In our study, we assess the long-term impact of large-scale SLMPs in Ethiopia using remotely sensed data from the past 24 years on 122 watersheds. Using a synthetic control method that does not require an explicit control group, we find statistically significant positive effects of SLMPs in both wet and dry seasons. These benefits persist at least eight years beyond the intervention period. Our findings highlight the need for multi-season impact assessments. Focusing only on the wet season may overlook key outcomes in dryland regions, underestimating the effectiveness of large-scale, multi-year projects. We further find that effects were most positive in drought-prone agricultural highlands, and that some administrative zones appear more effective than others at implementation.

Farmed Atlantic salmon accounts for 2% of global aquaculture, with productivity growth factors, such as research investment, credited with creating a high-value, globalized food commodity. However, its contribution to sustainability and nutrition goals remains unclear, and factors underlying consumer demand, such as marketing work, have been overlooked. We inspect the rise of farmed salmon in the UK, using key stakeholder interviews to understand the role of various actors (e.g. industry, retailers) in ‘making’ farmed salmon markets. Interviewees identified retailer strategies, such as labelling, and consumer-facing promotion efforts, such as health benefits, as key demand-growth factors underlying farmed salmon sales. Using data on UK seafood markets, we assess the views of interviewees, finding that farmed salmon is the most consumed aquatic food; however, it is less popular than other animal-source foods and is primarily consumed by affluent households. Our analyses discuss how market-making efforts by industry and retail actors have shaped consumer demand by promoting salmon as an accessible, nutritious and sustainable product. Accreditation and labelling have helped to develop perceptions of health and sustainability, despite farmed salmon being comparable in nutrient profile to other aquatic foods and having long-standing environmental impacts. Market-making insights could be used to enhance demand for other aquatic foods in ways that target dietary gaps by supplying affordable and sustainable products, such as mussels."

Our findings show that fragility is not limited to rural areas—urban communities experiencing in-migration also face risks due to limited alternatives. Removing one facility at a time revealed that it can cause up to a 500% increase in drive times to dialysis centers and hospitals for residents of Morgan City and Stephensville, while, on average, removing one random high school results in a 6%–30% increase in drive time across communities. We also introduced a criticality ranking method using total population, percentage of the population without an alternative, and marginal drive time for populations without alternatives, and calculated rank stability across different weightings of these three measures to identify facilities that are consistently most critical. Cameron Parish had the highest concentration of critical facilities, though facilities in Slidell and Mandeville also ranked highly, highlighting potential capacity concerns for two communities with growing populations. Finally, our equity analysis, performed using Monte Carlo simulations, shows that Native populations are disproportionately affected by limited access to services (∼29% are identified as outliers for dialysis and hospital access), while White populations experience the lowest average drive times to most CES facilities."

Nachlas,Physical–chemical properties of particles  in hailstones from central Argentina,"This study analyzed particles in hailstones from Argentina to better understand hail formation and growth. A unique method was used that revealed the particles’ size, composition, and location within the hail, including a variety of particle sizes and compositions linked to local land uses, such as mountainous, agricultural, and urban areas. The findings highlight the potential impacts of natural and human-related factors on hail formation and provide a new method for studying hail globally. 
 This study presents a novel analysis of two hailstones collected in central Argentina to provide insights into the size distribution, composition, and potential sources of non-soluble particles within hailstones. Using this new method, non-soluble particles are trapped beneath a thin layer of polyvinyl resin and analyzed with confocal laser and scanning electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive spectroscopy, preserving their in situ location and physical characteristics. The study characterized these particles' distribution, shape, and size and identified their elemental composition, which is used to interpret possible source regions. Particles ranged in diameter from our detection limit from 1 to 256 µm, with the largest particles consistently found in the hailstone embryos. Agglomerated mineral and organic particles dominated the elemental composition in both the embryo and outer layers, with the largest agglomerated particle (256 µm) being an organic-rich particle in the embryo of the larger hailstone. The composition and size distribution varied between the two hailstones: one contained agglomerated salt particles (up to 150 µm) in its embryo, traced to a nearby salt lake, while the other contained copper chloride and zinc chloride particles (up to 78 µm) primarily in its outer layers, potentially associated with agrochemicals commonly used for pest control and fertilizer in Argentina. Various local and regional land-use types, including shrublands, mixed vegetation, croplands, and urban areas, were linked to specific types of particles. Therefore, this study highlights the regional influence of various land-use types on hail formation and growth, pointing to the potential impacts of natural and anthropogenic factors on hailstone composition and revealing how particle characteristics vary between the embryo and outer layers of hailstones."

The PartMC model can provide detailed particle information and help these studies. This model is integrated with the ideal meteorological Cloud Model 1 (CM1) to simulate the aerosols at cloud-forming locations. Significant changes are revealed in the hygroscopicity distribution of aerosols within ascending air parcels. Additionally, different ascent times also affect aerosol aging processes. 
 Aerosols significantly impact the global climate by affecting the Earth's radiative balance and cloud formation. However, conducting cloud-altitude aerosol observations is currently costly and challenging, leading to gaps in accurately assessing aerosol activation properties during cloud formation. In this study, Cloud Model 1 (CM1) is employed to investigate the movement of air parcels under shallow-convection conditions in a coastal area. Subsequently, the evolution of various aerosol populations in the ideal scenarios is simulated by the Particle Monte Carlo (PartMC)–Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and Chemistry (MOSAIC) model to investigate their activation properties. It is found that leaving the boundary layer and entering the free atmosphere causes environmental changes in the parcels, which in turn alter the aerosol evolution and the cloud-forming potential. The impact of ascent timing is notably manifested in the concentration of ammonium nitrate rather than other chemical constituents. The rapid formation of ammonium nitrate accelerates the aerosol aging process, thereby modifying the hygroscopicity of the population. The differences between the aerosol populations in the boundary layer and at cloud altitudes highlight the necessity of vertical observations and numerical modeling. In addition, as supersaturation rises from 0.1 % to 1 %, the discrepancy in the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation ratio between the particle-resolved results and the internal mixing assumption increases from 7 % to 30 %. This emphasizes the potential of appropriate mixing-state parameterization in assessing aerosol activation properties. This study advances the understanding of aerosol hygroscopic changes under real weather conditions and offers insights into future modeling of aerosol–cloud microphysics."

Since turbulence is an important factor to maintain clouds in a mixed phase, it is hypothesized that turbulence may have an impact on the seeding effect. This hypothesis is evident in the present study, which shows that turbulence can accelerate the impact of airborne glaciogenic seeding of stratiform clouds. 
 Several recent studies have reported complete cloud glaciation induced by airborne-based glaciogenic cloud seeding over plains. Since turbulence is an important factor controlling mixed-phase clouds, including ice initiation, snow growth, and cloud longevity, it is hypothesized that turbulence may have an impact on the seeding effect. To understand the role of turbulence in seeded clouds, idealized Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) large eddy simulations over flat terrain were conducted for a shallow stratiform cloud in which complete glaciation was observed. The results show that the model can reasonably capture the magnitude and spatial distributions of radar echoes in seeded areas. Sensitivity tests suggest that, for this case, stronger turbulence enhanced the particle dispersion, the nucleation of silver iodide (AgI) particles, and the growth of ice crystals, which accelerated cloud glaciation, even though the condensation of droplets was also enhanced. The faster cloud glaciation intensified precipitation within a short time after seeding, while the liquid water was quickly consumed, leading to a decrease in precipitation rate in the further downwind areas. Such a transition from positive to negative seeding effect is more pronounced for seeding with a higher AgI release rate. This study provides strong evidence that turbulence plays a vital role in the physical chain of events associated with cloud seeding."

Alongside national inventories, independent databases provide yearly globally consistent emission inventories. Comparing independent inventories with countries submissions provides clear and consistent track of the real progress. Improvement of emissions inventories, reporting timelines, and statistical systems are essential to ensure reliable and comparable data. 
 Tracking greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is essential for understanding the drivers of climate change and guiding global mitigation strategies. The Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) and submissions by Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are two key sources of GHG emissions data. While EDGAR provides comprehensive and globally consistent estimates, UNFCCC submissions are based on nationally reported inventories, which adhere to specific guidelines and reflect country-specific circumstances and practices. This study presents a detailed comparison between EDGAR and UNFCCC GHG emissions inventories, focusing on G20 countries, which account for nearly 80 % of global emissions, as well as Annex I countries, including the EU27. By examining sectoral discrepancies, methodological variations, and the impact of reporting timelines, the paper identifies key areas of alignment and divergence in emissions estimates. While CO2 emissions show strong agreement between the datasets, CH4 and N2O estimates exhibit substantial discrepancies due to differences in methodologies, emission factors, uncertainties, and reporting practices. Our findings emphasise the need for enhanced methodological harmonization and more frequent reporting, particularly in non-Annex I countries, where limited capacity and irregular updates reduce comparability. Addressing these inconsistencies is crucial for improving transparency, aligning national and independent datasets, and strengthening climate policy decisions under the Paris Agreement."

It uses data from weather and climate models, whose resolution is steadily increasing. Processing the latest data had become a challenge, and the updates presented here ensure that WAM2layers runs smoothly again. We also made it easier to use the program and to understand its source code. This makes it more transparent, reliable, and easier to maintain. 
 This paper documents the atmospheric-moisture-tracking model WAM2layers v3 (Water Accounting Model – 2 layers, version 3). WAM2layers may be used to gain an understanding of atmospheric dynamics and to study rainfall patterns and extremes by mapping their sources or sinks, often in the context of climate and land-use changes. To this end, WAM2layers solves a prognostic equation for tagged moisture in gridded atmospheric datasets such as reanalysis data or climate model output. WAM2layers can be used in forward mode, to determine where evaporated water eventually precipitates, or in backward mode, to determine where precipitation originally evaporated.WAM2layers v3 represents a complete rewrite of the WAM2layers model originally introduced in 2010 and subsequently used in more than 60 academic studies. This latest version incorporates performance optimizations to cope with the increased resolution of input data and introduces various best practices aimed at improved user-friendliness and software sustainability. As an increasing number of researchers are using the code, this paper is intended as an updated description and reference in the academic literature. After describing the history, model formulation, and numerical implementation, we present and evaluate two example cases to illustrate the use and skill of WAM2layers v3. We then discuss best practices, some important assumptions, and directions for future development."

These models mimic the outputs of a complex vegetation model but run 95 % faster, enabling global analyses and supporting climate solutions in large modeling frameworks such as LandSyMM. 
 The assessment of forest-based climate change mitigation strategies relies on computationally intensive scenario analyses, particularly when dynamic vegetation models are coupled with socioeconomic models in multi-model frameworks. In this study, we developed surrogate models for the LPJ-GUESS dynamic global vegetation model to accelerate the prediction of carbon stocks and fluxes, enabling quicker scenario optimization within a multi-model coupling framework. We trained two machine learning methods: random forest and neural network. We assessed and compared the emulators using performance metrics and Shapley-based explanations. Our emulation approach accurately captured global and biome-specific forest carbon dynamics, closely replicating the outputs of LPJ-GUESS for both historical (1850–2014) and future (2015–2100) periods under various climate scenarios. Among the two trained emulators, the neural network extrapolated better at the end of the century for carbon stocks and fluxes and provided more physically consistent predictions, as verified by Shapley values. Overall, the emulators reduced the simulation execution time by 95 %, bridging the gap between complex process-based models and the need for scalable and fast simulations. This offers a valuable tool for scenario analysis in the context of climate change mitigation, forest management, and policy development."

Although the effects of MPs on soil EEAs have garnered increasing attention, the generalizable patterns and mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. To bridge this knowledge gap, we conducted a meta-analysis of 453 paired observations from 72 peer-reviewed publications evaluating MP-induced changes in soil EEAs with a focus on the roles of MP biodegradability, experimental additions, and the presence or absence of plants in mediating these effects. Our findings demonstrated that MPs increased soil N-acquiring (4%), P-acquiring (14%), and oxidative (8%) enzyme activities and decreased soil C-acquiring enzyme activities (2%). Notably, biodegradable MPs exhibited a more pronounced promotion of soil EEAs than did nonbiodegradable MPs. Experimental additions substantially mediated the effects of MPs on soil EEAs, where toxic substances promoted positive effects. However, the presence of plants attenuated these effects compared with plant-free conditions. Furthermore, critical mediators included MPs’ size (C-acquiring and N-acquiring enzyme activities), initial SOC content (P-acquiring enzyme activities), and experimental duration (oxidative enzyme activities). These findings highlight the potential effects of MPs on soil biochemical processes, providing insights into developing targeted management strategies to mitigate MP-induced threats in terrestrial ecosystems."

Herein, Ru supported on sulfated tin oxide (STO) was designed to demonstrate excellent activity, stability, and water resistance in the catalytic combustion of 1,2-dichloroethane (EDC). The presence of various sulfate species (–OSO3, –H2SO4, –HSO4), which can undergo reversible transformations, enhanced both the acidity and the mobility of H species, thereby facilitating the cleavage of C–H and C–Cl bonds to form the intermediates of vinyl chloride. Moreover, the dispersion of Ru species was significantly enhanced on the STO support, which effectively promoted the deep oxidation of the intermediates. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) analysis demonstrated distinct mechanistic pathways for the two catalysts. On the Ru/SnO2 catalyst, the interaction between surface oxygen species and H species generated through C–H bond dissociation led to hydroxyl group formation, which consequently suppressed deep oxidation. In contrast, on the Ru/STO catalyst, the coordination of –OSO3 groups with these H species to form –HSO4 effectively protected the surface oxygen species, thereby maintaining the oxidative capacity and ultimately facilitating complete EDC combustion."

Aerosols were sampled at coastal (Galveston) and inland (Hempstead and Jersey Village) sites during sea-breeze initiated convection and outflow events and analyzed using Raman microspectroscopy. Galveston’s aerosols primarily consisted of organic compounds, while Hempstead featured mainly inorganic salts (e.g., ammonium sulfate) and secondary organic aerosols. Organic aerosols were more abundant in Galveston (73%) than in Hempstead (65%). Particles exhibited diverse morphologies including homogeneous, core–shell, and complex structures. Homogeneous particles dominated at both sites, though Hempstead showed a higher fraction of core–shell particles. Cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations were 5 times higher at the inland sites than at the coast at a supersaturation of 0.2%, and this difference increased to 13 times higher at a 1.2% supersaturation. During sampling of the outflow of convective storm systems, distinct changes in aerosol size, morphology, and mixing state led to a significant increase in CCN activity at the inland (Jersey Village) site.

The survival of bees is threatened by multiple factors, such as pesticides, climatic conditions, and pathogens, of which pesticides are the main factor of concern. In recent years, significant advancements have been made in understanding the toxic effects of structurally diverse pesticides on bees. However, a systematic examination of the correlation mechanism of pesticide structures and their toxicity to bees remains inadequately addressed. Here, we investigated how structural diversity in pesticides leads to varying toxicities to bees and explored the potential mechanisms of the differences in toxicity. First, we categorized the pesticides reported in the literature as toxic to bees into seven distinct classes based on their structural characteristics. Then, we examined the correlation between the diversity of pesticide structures and their toxicity to bees. Finally, we investigated the potential mechanisms underlying differences in pesticide toxicity to bees, including target protein binding affinity, metabolic detoxification efficiency, and cuticle penetration dynamics. We believe our work provides valuable guidance for developing novel, structurally safer pesticides."

Atmospheric emissions of this gas have increased since industrialization, and their levels are highly elevated in many urban and natural environments; however, it is unresolved whether elevated levels of CO at environmentally relevant concentrations are primarily stimulatory or inhibitory to soil microbial communities. Here, we showed that CO exposure minimally affects microbial abundance, richness, and composition in diverse ecosystem soils, suggesting that most microbes are tolerant of this gas. Genome-resolved metagenomic profiling showed that these soils harbored diverse bacteria capable of using CO as an electron donor for aerobic respiration and carbon fixation. CO stimulated the growth of several of these putative CO-oxidizing bacteria in a dose-dependent manner, especially widespread proteobacterial and actinobacterial lineages. Additionally, we found a strong relationship between CO oxidation and carbon fixation and observed an enrichment of several carboxydotrophic MAGs capable of carbon fixation in most soil types. These findings highlight that environmentally relevant CO levels do not inhibit soil microbes but instead foster the growth of distinct carboxydotrophic bacteria, suggesting a robust soil CO sink that could help mitigate anthropogenic CO emissions and identify new players contributing to carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems."

This preliminary study investigated the occurrence and maternal transfer of PFAS in pregnant sharks (n = 6) from Florida’s coastal waters, encompassing a combined 101 embryos examined. Liver and muscle samples were collected from both adult mothers and embryos, with additional uterine fluid obtained from two species. The highest ∑PFAS concentration among the shark embryos was found in the liver of bonnethead (Sphyrna tiburo, 4.15 ± 0.16 ng/g ww, n = 8), followed by the great hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran, 1.60 ± 1.07 ng/g ww, n = 57), Atlantic sharpnose (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae, 1.41 ± 0.38 ng/g ww, n = 2), and the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier, 0.20 ± 0.20 ng/g ww, n = 34). The maternal transfer assessment revealed that perfluorooctanesulfonate and long-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (C12–C14) accumulated in embryonic tissues of sharks, highlighting that these chemicals were transferred efficiently during gestation. Spearman’s rank correlations showed a significant positive relationship between the maternal transfer ratio and the protein–water partition coefficient in select species, suggesting that the protein binding affinity of PFAS may enhance their transfer efficiency across the placental membrane."

Herein, a Cu-substitution strategy was employed to construct the Cu–O–Mn electron bridge in Mn3O4, enabling tailored electronic redistribution and enhanced molecular oxygen activation. A series of characterizations and DFT calculations revealed that the substitution of Cu decreased the electron density around the Mn atoms, generated abundant oxygen vacancies, and elevated the Mn4+ concentration, improving oxidative capacity. The optimized CuMn2O4 catalyst achieved 90% conversion of m-xylene at 246 °C, which was 12 °C lower than that of Mn3O4. The investigation of the mechanism demonstrated that the synergistic effect of Cu+ species and oxygen vacancies accelerated molecular oxygen activation and dynamically replenished the consumed lattice oxygen. Furthermore, the Cu–O–Mn bridge facilitated interfacial electron transfer, weakening Mn–O bonds and lowering oxygen vacancy formation energy, which promoted surface lattice oxygen mobility. Additionally, the CuMn2O4 catalyst exhibited excellent stability and water tolerance. This work provided new insights into electron regulation to accelerate molecular oxygen activation, which was beneficial for the targeted design of highly efficient catalysts for refractory m-xylene."

However, current formulation and practices are increasingly being scrutinized due to the low efficiency of applied nutrients with negative economic and environmental consequences. Enhance nutrient use efficiency requires a comprehensive understanding of soil–fertilizer interactions. Here, we contend that this knowledge has been generated by ‘bulk’ soil approaches that, while providing useful information, oversimplify these interactions by neglecting the strong chemical gradients occurring in the soils around fertilizers (i.e., in the fertosphere). Progress in non-destructive, in situ, and spatially resolved analytical techniques now allow a paradigm shift in the investigation of fertilizer chemistry in soil. For instance, mapping of diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) allows for nutrient availability to be quantified in 2D. Complementing DGT information with imaging X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES-imaging) provides an avenue to understand how chemical speciation along chemical gradients in the fertosphere controls nutrient availability. This information is essential to improve agronomic practices and for the development of novel fertilizers. This is particularly important in developing fertilizers from recycled materials and return nutrient cycles within, or at least closer to, their planetary boundaries."

In this study, we systematically elucidate its critical influence on the selective layer, separation performance, and kinetics of water molecule transport of TFC membranes by employing a combination of experimental investigations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The experimental results revealed the formation of a thinner and less cross-linked polyamide layer on the substrate with larger pore size, leading to a high water permeance of 35.4 L m–2 h–1 bar–1. In contrast, the smaller-pore-size substrate promoted the formation of a polyamide layer with more uniformly distributed pore size, resulting in better solute/solute selectivity (erythromycin/NaCl selectivity = 426). MD simulations confirmed the significant influence of substrate pore size on mass transfer in the TFC membrane.

Nine p-NEOs and 5 m-NEOs were measured in 159 paired serum and CSF samples. Seven p-NEOs and 5 m-NEOs were frequently detected in serum (median of 0.030–0.295 ng/mL), while 5 p-NEOs and 5 m-NEOs were commonly found in CSF (median of 0.032–0.283 ng/mL).

Nontarget analysis (NTA) using high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) is an emerging approach to examine complex chemical mixtures in the environment. Here, we leveraged archived samples previously analyzed for 154 target contaminants in a well-studied temperate region effluent-dominated stream and compared target results with suspected compounds from NTA. NTA enhanced the detectable chemical space by 20 times compared to target analysis alone. Target analysis was biased toward larger mass contaminants compared to the compounds detected with NTA, indicating that target analysis was not fully representative of the compound distribution for the effluent-impacted waters. Hierarchical cluster analysis exposed clusters of compounds significantly upregulated at the effluent/stream mixing zone, revealing evidence of a novel phenomenon wherein transformation product and/or metabolite formation appears to occur rapidly in situ. Additionally, an exposure-driven NTA retrospective analysis uncovered upregulation of 7endocrine-disrupting compounds that may explain prior bioassay results. These findings have urgent implications for ecosystems and downstream communities experiencing de facto wastewater reuse conditions.

Here, via mask wearing experiments (by volunteers), ambient air-mask interaction experiments, and ozone-mask reaction experiments, we find that the chemical exposure will be substantially changed during mask wearing due to gas-mask multiphase reactions with ambient ozone. In particular, this ozone oxidation chemistry leads to the formation of gaseous carbonyl compounds and a surface-bound organophosphate ester tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphate (TDtBPP, an emerging contaminant), with concentrations up to five times higher than those present in unused masks. While exposure assessments indicate that the health risks posed by gaseous carbonyl compounds and surface-bound organophosphate esters are likely to be minor, the present work emphasizes the importance of considering the dynamic evolution of mask-related chemicals when evaluating the overall chemical exposure related to face mask usage."

However, our study reveals that the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) exhibits an unexpected seasonality with prominent annual variability. Constructive (destructive) interference between annual and semiannual components strengthens (weakens) the EUC during early boreal spring (fall). We identify two key mechanisms underlying this behavior: (a) resonant second‐baroclinic‐mode waves enhance equatorial semiannual variability, but their first zero‐crossing near the depth of the EUC limits their contribution to the EUC seasonality; and (b) fourth‐baroclinic‐mode waves profoundly contribute to the annual variability, with equatorial Kelvin and Rossby waves resonating under annual forcing, enhancing the annual response of the EUC.

Marsh migration is largely attributed to ocean forcings such as sea‐level rise and storm surges. Here we show that terrestrial hydrology may also be a major driver of coastal ecosystem change. Data from the Delmarva Peninsula, USA show that declining upland groundwater head weakens the hydraulic gradient, causing shallow saline groundwater to push inland from coastal marshes. This drives SWI into coastal freshwater forests and farms at magnitudes that can exceed SWI from storms. We show that storm events often contribute to groundwater freshening through rainfall that restores the hydraulic gradient and flushes saline groundwater.

Nickerson;Gregory P. King;Jun A. Zhang,Turbulence of Tropical Cyclones: From Peristrophic to Zonostrophic,"Cyclostrophic rotation in the core region of tropical cyclones (TCs) imprints a distinct signature upon their turbulence structure. Its intensity is characterized by the radius of maximum wind, Rmw ${R}_{mw}$, and the azimuthal wind velocity at that radius, Umax ${U}_{max}$. The corresponding cyclostrophic Coriolis parameter, fˆ=2Umax $\widehat{f}=2{U}_{max}$/Rmw ${R}_{mw}$, far exceeds its planetary counterpart, f $f$, for all storms; its impact increases with storm intensity. The vortex can be thought of as a system undergoing a superposition of planetary and cyclostrophic rotations represented by the effective Coriolis parameter, f∼=fˆ+f $\tilde{f}=\widehat{f}+f$. On the vortex periphery, f∼ $\tilde{f}$ merges with f $f$. In the classical Rankine vortex model, the inner region undergoes solid‐body rotation rendering fˆ $\widehat{f}$ constant. In a more realistic representation, fˆ $\widehat{f}$ is not constant, and the ensuing cyclostrophic β $\beta $‐effect sustains vortex Rossby waves. Horizontal turbulence in such a system can be quantified by a two‐dimensional anisotropic spectrum. An alternative description is provided by one‐dimensional, longitudinal, and transverse spectra computed along the radial direction. For rotating turbulence with vortex Rossby waves, the spectra divulge a coexistence of three ranges: Kolmogorov, peristrophic (spectral amplitudes are proportional to f∼2 ${\tilde{f}}^{2}$), and zonostrophic (transverse spectrum amplitude is proportional to βˆ2 ${\widehat{\beta }}^{2}$). A comprehensive database of TC winds collected by reconnaissance airplanes reveals that with increasing storm intensity, their cyclostrophic turbulence evolves from purely peristrophic to mixed peristrophic‐zonostrophic to predominantly zonostrophic. The latter is akin to the flow regime harboring zonal jets on fast rotating giant planets. The eyewall of TCs is an equivalent of an eastward zonal jet."

Alternatively, waterbelt states with a narrow equatorial strip of ice‐free ocean provide a compelling explanation for the survival of life during these extreme glaciations. In this study, we establish a framework to quantify three atmospheric factors that influence waterbelt states: the spatial extent of bare dark sea ice set by the pattern of surface precipitation and evaporation, cloud masking of the ice‐albedo feedback, and cloud shortwave feedback. We first explore these factors in the Budyko‐Sellers energy balance model, and then investigate them in simulations with three versions of the ICON global climate model. This allows us to relate differences in the waterbelt states between ICON versions to the three factors. A broader Hadley circulation shifts the boundary between snow‐covered and bare sea ice poleward, leading to waterbelt states whose ice lines are at higher latitudes. Cloud masking always works in favor of stable waterbelt states by weakening the ice‐albedo feedback. The role of the cloud shortwave feedback, in contrast, depends on the ICON version: in one version, increasing cloud condensate over the low‐latitude open ocean destabilizes waterbelt states and creates an additional small hysteresis. In the other two versions, the cloud shortwave feedback is stabilizing. While our study does not answer which of the model versions is most realistic, it provides a quantitative framework for understanding the atmospheric mechanisms that govern the existence and hysteresis of waterbelt states."

Although these features are primarily driven by intense offshore winds, their impact on local atmospheric conditions remains poorly understood. This study employs a high‐resolution polar Weather Research and Forecasting model configuration over the Prydz Bay region, East Antarctica, home to two major coastal polynyas: Cape Darnley and Mackenzie Bay polynyas. Sensitivity experiments over three winters (2014–2016) comparing simulations with and without polynyas reveal a marked and spatially confined atmospheric response. Polynya openings induce substantial surface heat release (up to 700 W m−2), warming near‐surface air by over 5 K and triggering convection and clouds. This results in a thickening of the atmospheric boundary layer and the development of stronger surface winds (up to 4 m s−1) that converge toward a low‐pressure anomaly. A particular emphasis is placed on the mechanisms controlling wind anomalies, using a dedicated wind tendency analysis. This diagnosis highlights that the processes involved depend on location and altitude within the polynya region and involve a balance between vertical mixing, horizontal advection, and pressure gradient forces—vertical mixing acting as the initiating factor. This study provides a novel modeling framework used to isolate the atmospheric response to coastal polynyas, overcoming limitations of previous studies and coarse‐resolution models. It offers new insights into the role of polynyas in modulating regional climate and improving understanding of the processes driving their dynamics."

We use the dynamical adjustment approach to assess the contributions of atmospheric circulation and Soil moisture (SM) to this heatwave and find that they contributed 69.8% and 39.5%, respectively. The anomalous anticyclone that caused this heatwave was influenced by upstream signals. Easterly winds on the southern side of the anticyclone led to anomalous subsidence, which heated the air over North China. While such anomalous anticyclones over North China are not uncommon due to atmospheric circulation variability, the 2023 heatwave still broke records because the SM‐temperature coupling during the heatwave was unprecedented, with a strength four times that of typical years. The dry soil conditions during the heatwave stemmed from a lack of precipitation beforehand, with cumulative rainfall in North China being the lowest since 1979. The early dryness of the soil provided favorable conditions for land‐atmosphere feedback, and under the trigger of subsidence‐induced warming from the early summer anticyclone, the strong SM‐temperature coupling significantly amplified the intensity of this heatwave. For future projections, numerical experiment analysis shows that temperatures currently considered extreme during 2023 heatwave event will become commonplace in the future due to SM‐atmosphere coupling. However, by the end of the century, the impact of land‐atmosphere coupling on extreme high temperatures in North China will diminish compared to historical period, owing to increased SM."

Internal variability, primarily the phase transition of Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV), plays a dominant role in shaping WCAP trends. The AMV‐induced Rossby wave train, sustained by extracting baroclinic energy from the background mean flow, triggers barotropic atmospheric circulation anomalies that modulate WCAP. The cold‐to‐warm AMV phase transition (1891–1946) weakened the externally forced upward precipitation trend, reducing it from 0.19 to −0.20 mm month−1 decade−1. In contrast, the warm‐to‐cold phase transition (1947–1997) amplified the externally forced precipitation trend, increasing it from 0.28 to 0.99 mm month−1 decade−1. Under the high‐emission future scenario, the time of emergence of externally driven WCAP increases is projected to occur between 2030 and 2060, at least a decade earlier than the post‐2060 timeline projected under the medium‐emission scenario. These findings underscore the critical role of AMV in shaping WCAP variability and highlight the necessity of emission reductions to delay the time when externally driven precipitation increases exceed the region's adaptive capacity."

We examined soil carbon mineralization patterns under four common grassland management practices implemented on the Qinghai‐Tibetan Plateau (i.e., seasonal grazing, continuous grazing, perennial artificial grasslands, and annual artificial grasslands) using a 147‐day incubation experiment. We also analyzed soil properties, microbial communities, and carbon degradation genes to understand the mechanisms driving carbon mineralization. We observed distinct depth‐dependent responses to management practices. In surface soils (0–0.15 m), seasonal grazing exhibited the highest cumulative carbon mineralization (2993.32 mg CO2‐C kg−1), 1.5‐fold higher than annual artificial grasslands. However, in subsurface soils (0.15–0.30 m), continuous grazing showed the greatest cumulative carbon mineralization (2355.18 mg CO2‐C kg−1), 1.5‐fold higher than perennial artificial grasslands. Collectively, soil properties, carbon degradation genes, and fungal diversity explained 74% of the variation in cumulative carbon mineralization, with soil properties showing the strongest direct effect (path coefficient = 0.62). Interestingly, bacterial diversity exhibited a negative relationship with cumulative carbon mineralization, suggesting previously underappreciated mechanisms of carbon preservation involving microbial‐derived compounds and their interaction with soil minerals. The variability in the abundance of specific carbon degradation genes across grassland management practices revealed that peroxidase and limonene 1,2‐epoxide hydrolase genes showed positive correlations with cumulative carbon mineralization. Our results suggest that optimal soil carbon management in high‐altitude grasslands is challenging and requires careful consideration of both grassland management practices and soil depth, especially spatial and temporal patterns of grazing pressure."

Jones,Evaluating How Climate Adaptation Measures Affect the Interconnected Water‐Energy Resource Systems of the Western United States,"The Western US faces increasing water stress from the impacts of climate change, making it difficult to meet water demands for the region's cities, agriculture, and hydropower generators. Existing literature suggests that climate adaptation measures such as water conservation, cropland retirement, wastewater recycling, and managed aquifer recharge can alleviate some of these challenges. Few analyses, however, compare the relative efficacy and system‐wide effects of these adaptations under different climate projections across the entire Western United States. Here we use a Western US‐wide water systems model to evaluate, by sector and sub‐region, how the widespread implementation of these adaptive measures impacts water demands, water deliveries, and electricity use related to the water system for three different climate projections. We find that wastewater recycling has greater potential to lower unmet indoor water demands than urban indoor water conservation measures. However, when implemented at scale, indoor water conservation reduces electricity use by an average of 683 Terawatt hours while wastewater recycling increases energy use by an average of 721 Terawatt hours, cumulatively from 2020 to 2070. Cropland retirement and aquifer recharge adaptations increase the ability to meet agricultural water demand, increase groundwater storage, and reduce summertime electricity use. While most of these findings are consistent across different climate projections, the benefits of aquifer recharge are sensitive to spatial variation of precipitation. Given the limitations and tradeoffs of each individually, the results suggest that a portfolio of adaptation measures will be needed for a climate‐resilient water and energy future in the Western US."

However, the precise regulatory mechanism underlying PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy during browning of iWAT remains largely unknown. Here we report that PNPLA7, an Endoplasmic Reticulum and mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM) protein, inhibits browning of iWAT by promoting PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy upon cold challenge or β3-adrenergic receptor agonist treatment. With genetic manipulation in mice, we show that adipose tissue overexpressing PNPLA7 induces mitophagy, abolishes iWAT browning and interrupts adaptive thermogenesis. Conversely, conditional ablation of PNPLA7 in adipose tissue promotes browning of iWAT, resulting in enhanced adaptive thermogenesis. Mechanistically, PNPLA7 interacts with Parkin to promote mitochondrial recruitment of Parkin for mitophagy activation and mitochondria degradation by disrupting PKA-induced phosphorylation of Parkin under cold challenge. Taken together, our findings suggest that PNPLA7 is a critical regulator of mitophagy that resists cold-induced browning of iWAT, thus providing a direct mechanistic link between mitophagy and browning of iWAT.

 Solid solutions are a unique and elegant crystal engineering strategy to control the properties of crystalline materials, and the tunability of physicochemical properties it provides has a wide scope of applications. In this research, we bring this strategy to the realm of smart molecular crystals and explore solid solutions of organic photomechanical crystals to create flexible structures that exhibit a gradient of predetermined emissive, mechanical, and reactive properties. Specifically, we demonstrate that fluorescence, mechanical properties, and solid-state photoreactivity in a binary mixed crystal system of 9-anthraldehyde (9AA) and 9-methylanthracene (9MA) can be simultaneously and precisely tuned simply by changing the composition. The statistical distribution of the two components in the solid solution was utilized to prepare a heterodimer by a cross-reaction between the molecules of the two components. The effect of doping on the rate and the extent of the solid-state photoreaction further enables modulation of the photomechanical bending of the crystals. This study shows that the solid solution method enables access to smart adaptive crystals that can perform specific solid-state photoreactions, exhibit a photomechanical response, and support flexible organic devices that cannot be achieved through conventional chemical modification strategies.

 Timely access to DNA lesions is crucial for genome integrity. This process requires profound remodeling of densely packed chromatin to establish a repair-competent architecture. However, limited resolution has made it impossible to fully understand these remodeling events. Here, combining microirradiation with live-cell multiscale imaging, we report that DNA damage-induced changes in genome packing rely on the conformational behaviour of the chromatin fiber. Immediately after damage, a transient increase in nucleosome mobility switches chromatin from a densely-packed state to a looser conformation, making it accessible to repair. While histone poly-ADP-ribosylation is required to trigger this switch, mono-ADP-ribosylation is sufficient to maintain the open-chromatin state. The removal of these histone marks by the ARH3 hydrolase then leads to chromatin recondensation. Together, our multiscale study of chromatin dynamics establishes a global model: distinct waves of histone ADP-ribosylation control nucleosome mobility, triggering a transient breathing of chromatin, crucial for initiating the DNA damage response.

Applying FFT-PLSR on these sites yields a variant Com2-IFRS showing a 30.8-fold increase in SCS efficiency, and up to 7.8-fold improvement in the catalytic efficiency (kcat/KmtRNA). Transplanting these mutations into 7 PylRS-derived synthetases significantly improves the yields of proteins containing 6 types of ncAAs.

 Plastic pollution is one of most daunting sustainability challenges. Multi-functional and biodegradable plastics are critical for both desirable end-of-life outcomes and petrochemical plastics replacement. Current bioplastics are either: short of mechanical properties, like polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB); lack room temperature biodegradability, like polylactic acid (PLA); or lack the functionality to create additional values.

 The integration of basally located progenitors into an existing epithelium, termed apical emergence, is crucial for the morphogenesis and homeostasis of epithelial tissues and organs. Using Xenopus as a model system, we explore the role of intracellular calcium in apical emergence during the development of mucociliary skin epithelium. Our findings reveal that calcium transients precede the apical emergence of Multiciliated cell (MCC) progenitors and are essential for their insertion into the overlying skin epithelium.

 Clonal deletion through negative selection is critical to eliminate autoreactive T cells in the thymus. Negative selection, however, is imperfect such that some autoreactive thymocytes can escape thymic deletion and successfully populate peripheral tissues. This is also the case for autoreactive 2D2 TCR transgenic T cells, a widely employed mouse model in studying the pathogenesis of CD4 T cell-mediated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. How autoreactive 2D2 thymocytes evade negative selection, however, remains incompletely understood. Here we show that negative selection of MHC-II-restricted thymocytes, specifically 2D2 TCR transgenic T cells, is associated with the induction of integrin CD103, and that forced expression of CD103 downregulates CXCR4 expression, alters intra-thymic trafficking, and reinforces clonal deletion of immature thymocytes. Stratification of positively versus negatively selected 2D2 T cells based on their distinct coreceptor expression further shows that CD103 does not affect the generation of conventional CD4 T cells but is deleterious for autoreactive CD4, CD8 double-negative 2D2 T cells that correspond to CD69-negative CCR7-intermediate thymocytes, displaying markers of agonistic TCR signalling. Collectively, these results propose CD103 expression as an indicator and contributor of negative selection for MHC-II-restricted T cells, providing further mechanistic insights into the process of T cell selection in the thymus.

Here the authors use eddy covariance data to show that respiration may adapt to warmer temperatures and carbon losses may be lower than expected. 
 Ecosystem respiration (ER) is the largest contributor to terrestrial carbon loss. ER responds positively to increasing temperature, so a warming world is hypothesized to lead to additional CO2 release, potentially further exacerbating climate warming. The long-term influence of thermal changes on this carbon–climate feedback, however, remains unresolved. Here, by compiling data from 221 eddy covariance sites worldwide, we observe decreases in the temperature sensitivity and reference respiration rates of ER with increasing mean annual temperature, suggesting that ER adapts to temperature changes. Our results further reveal that thermal adaptation would eliminate 17.91–31.41% of the anticipated increase in the respiration of unadapted ecosystems under future warming scenarios, equivalent to a net carbon loss of 0.85–11.83 Pg C per year. The increase in respiration rates of terrestrial ecosystems in response to climate warming may thus be lower than predicted, with important consequences for modulating future terrestrial carbon–climate feedback.

 The use of molybdenum isotopes (δ98Mo) as a paleo-redox proxy requires quantifications of fluxes and isotopic fractionations in each molybdenum sink. However, no systematic tests on δ98Mo variations in different oxic sediments have been made due to limitations of analytical precision and sample number in pioneering studies. Here, we present the δ98Mo data of ferromanganese nodules sampled at various global basins, which exhibit large variations from −0.95‰ to −0.51‰ with appreciable negative correlations between δ98Mo and manganese–iron ratios. Diagenetic nodules, experiencing dissolution and re-precipitation of manganese oxides in marine sediments, have lower δ98Mo by ~0.3‰ and higher molybdenum contents relative to hydrogenetic nodules. We suggest that changes in relative proportions of manganese and iron oxides and early diagenesis of marine sediments likely influence overall molybdenum isotope fractionations in oxic sinks. Hence, evolution of ancient marine manganese and iron cycles can influence sedimentary δ98Mo signatures, especially in low-oxygen Precambrian oceans.

Here, we estimate the dependency of drought terminations on tropical cyclone rainfall through frequency analyses and event coincidence analysis. Results show that ~3% of the tropical cyclone-affected areas have experienced multiple drought events terminated by tropical cyclone rainfall from 1999 to 2021. Globally, tropical cyclone-terminated drought events averaged 1.12 annually and increased significantly by 1.92% per year. Increases were especially significant in the Arabian Peninsula, South Asia, and the northwest of Australia. Rainfall produced by tropical cyclones alleviates drought events more drastically than that by other weather systems, such as fronts, mesoscale convective systems, and atmospheric rivers. These findings underscore the adaptation of precipitation changes due to shifts in the timing and weather systems under a warming climate. Tropical cyclone rainfall terminated drought events on average of 1.1 times per year globally from 1999 to 2021, with a significant annual increase of 1.9%, particularly in the Arabian Peninsula, South Asia, and northwest of Australia, according to the frequency and event coincidence analyses"

 In recent years, research in flood mapping from remote sensing satellite imagery has predominantly focused on deep learning methods. While new flood segmentation models are increasingly being proposed, most of these works focus on advancing architectures trained on single datasets. Therefore, these studies overlook the intrinsic limitations and biases of the available training and evaluation data. This often leads to poor generalization and overconfident predictions when these models are used in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, the objective of this work is twofold. First, we train and evaluate flood segmentation models on five publicly available datasets including data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and both SAR and multispectral modalities. Our findings reveal that models achieving high detection accuracy on a single dataset (intra-dataset validation) do not necessarily generalize well to unseen datasets. In contrast, models trained on more diverse samples from multiple datasets demonstrate greater robustness and generalization ability. Furthermore, we present a dual-stream multimodal architecture that can be independently trained and tested on both single-modality and dual-modality datasets. This enables the integration of all the diversity and richness of the available data into a single unified framework. The results emphasize the need for a more comprehensive validation using diverse and well-designed datasets, particularly for multimodal approaches. If not adequately addressed, the shortcomings of current datasets can significantly limit the potential of deep learning-based operational flood mapping approaches."

 Northeast China is one of China’s most important rice production bases, contributing about one-fifth of the country’s rice production. In recent years, several agricultural policies have been implemented in Northeast China to adjust crop structures, driven by economic and ecological benefits. Timely monitoring of the changed pattern of rice cultivation is a prerequisite for policy assessment. Current paddy rice mapping methods are experiencing uncertainties due to confusion with wetlands and are highly parameter-dependent. To these, in this study, we developed a paddy rice mapping framework that integrates automatically generated training samples, time series features from key cultivation stages, and a deep learning model to improve paddy rice identification accuracy in Northeast China, which is a typical rice-wetland coexisting area. We produced 10 m paddy rice maps for 2019–2023 in Northeast China and examined their changes under agricultural policy implementation. The resultant paddy rice maps have high accuracies, with overall accuracies >0.97, producer’s accuracies >0.94, user’s accuracies ≥0.93, and F1 scores of ≥0.95, respectively. Our proposed mapping method effectively identified small patches of paddy rice and reduced confusion with wetlands. Paddy rice areas in Northeast China estimated in this study continued to decrease annually from 71.1 × 103 km2 in 2019 to 56.4 × 103 km2 in 2023. Hot spots of rice conversion to other crops were found in the Sanjiang Plain, mainly due to the Soybean Revitalization Plan. The rice cultivation expansion was mainly found in the Songnen Plain, resulting from policies on Rehabilitation and Utilization of Saline Soils. Observed changes in paddy rice plantation emphasize the importance and necessity of timely and continuous crop cultivation monitoring under the influence of agricultural policy adjustment."

 Biodegradation of small organics by bacteria in the atmosphere efficiently competes with chemical losses despite the low number concentration of metabolically active bacteria. We measured biodegradation rates of formaldehyde by three bacterial strains isolated from fog water (belonging to the genera Comamonas, Pseudomonas and Methylobacterium) as a function of pH (4.8–6.8), with invariably highest rates for each strain at the highest pH. We also investigated the potential impact of formaldehyde biodegradation in the presence of sulfite on hydroxymethanosulfonate (HMS), an adduct of formaldehyde and S(IV) frequently detected in fog and cloud water. Our observations show that HMS formation reduces the rate of formaldehyde biodegradation by acting as a formaldehyde reservoir. The newly determined biodegradation rates were incorporated into a state-of-the-art atmospheric multiphase chemistry box model that realistically considers a small fraction of fog droplets contain bacteria to simulate for the first time the effect of biodegradation on formaldehyde and HMS concentrations under typical conditions of night-time radiation fog. The model results suggest that biodegradation decreases the concentration of formaldehyde by ∼1 % and that of HMS <0.1 %, i.e., likely below detection thresholds needed to confidently attribute changes in aqueous phase concentrations to biodegradation. The loss by biodegradation may contribute as much to the total loss of aqueous phase formaldehyde as chemical reactions since during night-time also chemical losses are small. The discrepancies between high biodegradation rates measured in laboratory and the low impaction on atmospheric chemistry from modelling findings can be attributed to differences in timescales (72–84 h in the lab vs. ∼1-h fog droplet lifetimes) and oxidative conditions, which result in rapid S(IV) oxidation in fog, thus limiting HMS formation."

This study identifiesd-serine as a crucial regulator of gut ROS during SD. Knockdown of serine racemase (SR), the enzyme responsible ford-serine production, prevents the enhanced ROS buildup during SD inDrosophila. Gut enterocytes (ECs) respond to γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling by producingd-serine, which influences downstreamN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activity and modulates sleep pressure. However, the continuous demand for sleep disrupts this feedback loop. Prolonged SD leads to increased levels ofd-serine in the gut, an elevated pyruvate pool in ECs, enhanced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, impaired lipid metabolism in peroxisomes, and the accumulation of harmful ROS. In conclusion, our findings illuminate the metabolic alterations and brain-gut communication pathways that may contribute to the increase in gutd-serine and subsequent ROS accumulation induced by SD."

We analyzed 58,007 US women with two or more singleton live births (146,064 pregnancies, 1956–2015). Offspring sex followed a beta-binomial rather than a simple binomial distribution, indicating that each family may have a unique probability of male or female births, akin to a weighted coin toss. Deviations from simple binomial distribution were more pronounced when we excluded each woman’s last birth to reduce the influence of sex-based stopping behavior. After excluding the last birth, older maternal age at first birth was associated with higher odds of having offspring of only one sex.

This process yields multicomponent precipitates with an ultrahigh APB energy (~308 ± 14 millijoules per square meter), which notably strengthens the alloy. Moreover, the exceptionally high APB energy transforms the deformation mechanism from dislocation shearing to stacking fault shearing, thereby avoiding glide plane softening.

We leverage leading-edge deep learning algorithms and a detailed three-dimensional velocity model to construct a 15-year high-resolution earthquake catalog of the Yellowstone caldera region. More than half of the region’s earthquakes are clustered into swarm-like families characterized by episodes of hypocenter expansion and migration. Adjacent earthquake swarms, separated by long quiescent periods, are found to be a dominant feature. We suggest that these swarms are controlled by the interplay between slowly diffusing aqueous fluids and rapid episodic fluid injections, which may result from the breaking of permeability seals. Our analyses also indicate that clustered seismicity beneath the caldera occurs on relatively immature, rougher fault structures, compared to more planar faults outside. Our results provide additional context for understanding seismicity in hydrothermal systems, highlighting the key role played by long-term fluid diffusion processes in driving the occurrence of earthquake swarms."

Here, we used cryo–electron tomography to analyze the structure ofSulfolobusellipsoid virus 1 (SEV1), an archaeal virus with an ellipsoidal shape and a lipid envelope, and its infection strategy. We show that the SEV1 nucleocapsid adopts a “coil-stacking” architecture with substantial flexibility. The major capsid protein VP4, whose homologs are widespread in the thermoacidic environments around the Pacific Rim, binds genomic DNA in the formation of a nucleoprotein filament with a “beads-on-a-string” appearance. The virion is notably stable at high temperature and acidic pH, and the envelope of SEV1 is crucial to the thermostability of the virion. The infected cell undergoes cytoplasmic condensation to form patches associated with the assembly intermediates of the progeny virions.

In three independent lung adenocarcinoma cohorts, our AI-based model accurately predicted cell differential status and provided quantifiable measures of tumor progression that were prognostic of patient survival. Spatial transcriptomic integrative analyses revealed cell components and gene signatures enriched in different cell differentiation statuses. Bulk transcriptomic analyses revealed that fast-progressing tumors exhibit up-regulated cell cycle pathways, while slow-progressing tumors retain characteristics of normal lung epithelium.

Using a panel of fluorescent probes, our 3D pathology pipeline revealed that PolySTAT treatment preserves neurovascular density and function, reduces hypoxia and blood extravasation, and reduces brain tissue loss after TBI. To further corroborate the 3D microscopy–based findings, gene expression analyses show that PolySTAT attenuates the expression of inflammation and reactive gliosis biomarkers.

By regulating the length of cationic amino acid side chains, the optimized peptide Nhar was identified as a triple-functional candidate with the potential to solve these limitations. In aqueous solutions, Nhar self-assembles into nanofibers that trap pathogens, prevent their spread, and selectively kill Gram-positive bacteria. Nhar demonstrates remarkable protease resistance, retaining antimicrobial activity even under protease conditions (10 milligrams per milliliter). It induces bacterial death primarily through membrane disruption and multiple synergistic mechanisms. In aStaphylococcus aureus–induced mouse bacteremia model, Nhar showed promising therapeutic potential. This work offers important insights for developing multifunctional antimicrobial therapies."

Here, we investigate phase transitions in polymer-grafted nanooctahedra by varying polymer length, nanocrystal size, truncation, and ligand density. In two-dimensional superlattices, longer polymers or smaller nanooctahedra induce a transition from orientationally ordered to hexagonal rotator lattices. In three-dimensional superlattices, increasing polymer length drives transitions from Minkowski to body-centered cubic and plastic hexagonal close-packed phases, while higher grafting densities further enable transitions to simple hexagonal phases. Polymer brush and thermodynamic perturbation theories, supported by Monte Carlo simulations, uncover the entropic and enthalpic forces that govern these transitions.

DeletingPRDM1in human CD4+T cells and Tregcells also increased IL-2 signaling. Furthermore, CD4+T cells from patients with ATL expressed less BLIMP1 and had enhanced IL-2 signaling, whereas overexpressingPRDM1in ATL cells suppressed IL-2 signaling.

In turn, pollution of the BMO by progressive addition of recycled basaltic crust and related “reactive crystallization” can reconcile LLVP volumes, densities, and compositions. This model also makes testable predictions of the compositions of “ultralow-velocity zones,” enigmatic deep Earth seismic domains, and possible BMO remnants.

Microplastics-derived DOM (MPs-DOM), particularly that released during photoaging, represents an emerging source of DOM in aquatic environments. However, its capacity to mediate Hg(II) transformation remains largely unexplored. This study investigated dark reduction of Hg(II) by DOM released from aging polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, and polylactic acid under simulated environmental conditions. The results show that, under dark conditions, DOM from photoaged MPs suspensions reduced over 30% of Hg(II) within 10 min, whereas DOM from dark-aged MPs suspensions exhibited negligible Hg(II) reduction activity. Further analyses showed that photoaging enhanced the electron-donating capacity of MPs-DOM by increasing phenol-like compounds, which promoted Hg(II) reduction via electron transfer through phenolic hydroxyl groups. Notably, MPs-DOM released during photoaging outperformed the Suwannee River natural organic matter (SRNOM) in reducing Hg(II), likely due to compositional differences in Hg(II)-complexing functional groups. When mixed together, elevated concentrations of MPs-DOM dominated over SRNOM, favoring Hg(II) reduction as the primary pathway. Given the growing prevalence of MPs-DOM in aquatic ecosystems and the persistence of dark reactions in light-limited environments, this study underscores the significant role of MPs-DOM in promoting dark Hg(II) reduction, highlighting a previously underrecognized pathway affecting Hg cycling."

Although advancements in separation performance have been frequently reported, significant challenges in evaluating mixed-salt IEM performance under electro-driven conditions remain largely overlooked. Here, we present a new method for the rapid and standardized characterization of ion transport properties for IEMs in mixed-salt systems. Using a modified Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation, we demonstrate that individual ion permeability can be obtained from IEM conductance measurements with mixed-salt linear sweep voltammetry experiments. Under low-current conditions, the ion permeability ratio can be converted into different metrics for quantification of ion–ion selectivity including current-based and flux-based selectivity. Our findings also reveal substantial differences between ion transport properties of IEMs under single-salt and mixed-salt conditions, highlighting the critical role of competing ions in transport experiments. Overall, this new approach provides an efficient framework to evaluate IEM performance in environmentally relevant conditions, facilitating cross-membrane performance comparison and establishing the foundation to elucidate the structure-property-performance relationships for IEMs in mixed-salt systems."

This study investigated the concentrations, emission rates, and particle size distributions of ARGs in air around a dairy farm and swine farm, as well as in farm wastewater and soil as potential sources, during a yearlong sampling campaign. Analysis targeted genes corresponding to a cross-section of antibiotic classes used in human and veterinary medicine, along with 16S rRNA and intI1 as indicators of total bacterial load and anthropogenic sources of ARGs, respectively. Two approaches were demonstrated for estimating emissions to account for the physical configurations of the farms. A custom sampler that collected size-resolved aerosol particles at a flow rate of 2.25 L/min only when the wind originated from the direction of interest was used to collect aerosol particles near potential sources. At the dairy and swine farms, blaCTX-M1 concentrations varied significantly by sampling location, averaging 102 gene copies per cubic meter (gc m–3) across seasons and peaking at 104 gc m–3 during the summer sampling period. At the swine farm, maximum concentrations reached 105 gc m–3 for intI1, ermF, and qnrA near the buildings’ exhaust fans. Emission rates reached ∼ 105 gc s–1 for some ARGs, including blaCTX-M1, and 106 gc s–1 for intI1.

This study finds that springtime snow cover variability over the western TP tail is significantly modulated by the Western Tibetan Vortex (WTV), which explains up to 40% variance. Cyclonic (anticyclonic) WTV variability generally causes water vapor convergence (divergence) and ascending (sinking) motions over the western TP tail, which thereby leads to more (less) snowfall and snow cover about one day later. Horizontal water vapor transport at the southern boundary of the western TP tail from the tropical Indian Ocean is key for the influence of the WTV.

We perform such simulations with the Ai2 Climate Emulator (ACE), a machine learning‐based emulator trained on ERA5 reanalysis data (ACE2‐ERA5). This produces a sensitivity map of the top‐of‐atmosphere radiative response to surface warming that aligns with our physical understanding of radiative feedbacks. However, ACE2‐ERA5 likely underestimates the radiative response to historical warming. We compare to two additional versions of ACE and traditional climate models.

Because of the small scale of these storms and the complexity of the involved processes, observing and modeling convective storms is challenging. The potential of online diagnostics in convection‐permitting models to simulate hail and lightning, especially over climatic time scales and extended regions, has not yet been fully exploited. To address this gap, we present a European‐wide hail and lightning climatology (2011–2021) using the Consortium for Small Scale Modeling (COSMO) regional climate model with a horizontal grid spacing of 2.2 km, coupled with a hail growth model (HAILCAST) and the lightning potential index (LPI) diagnostics. We further developed a new European‐wide hail product based on the Operational Program for the Exchange of Weather Radar Information (OPERA) composite. Model validation against observations demonstrates an overall good performance in simulating hail and lightning on spatial, seasonal, and diurnal scales. The highest hail frequencies occur during summer along the slopes of high mountain ridges, such as the Alps, Pyrenees, and the Carpathians, aligning with observed lightning hotspots in Europe. In autumn, hail and lightning occur predominantly over the Mediterranean and along the Adriatic coast. Severe hail events with a maximum hail diameter larger than 20 mm mainly occur in the Po Valley, western Spain, and Eastern Europe.

Once water supplies have been fully allocated and developing new water supplies is infeasible, the best option to meet growing water demands is often to reallocate water from rural agricultural water uses. Yet, the dynamics and implications of these rural‐to‐urban water transfers are poorly understood. Here, we integrate an agent‐based model with an input‐output model to capture the behavior of individual irrigators and examine how their water transfer decisions propagate through the broader rural economy and shape social dynamics. As a demonstration of our model, the rural community represents Alamosa County while the city represents the city of Denver, both located in Colorado, Unites States. We find that the greatest long‐term decline in crop water use corresponds with higher city growth rates while the greatest short‐term decline corresponds with larger farmer discount rates. As farmers sell their water rights to the City, economic activity from the crop production sector declines, causing unemployment in the crop production sector to increase and demand from the service sectors to decrease, which results in output declining in these economic sectors as well. Thus, a negative impact on the agricultural sector will cause some negative impact on other economic sectors, such as professional, health care, and recreational services. This research brings new insights that can be used to evaluate the socio‐economic impacts of water transfers and shape policy to minimize potential negative externalities associated with water transfers."

 Quantitative understanding of ion transport mechanism is crucial for numerous applications of two-dimensional (2D) nanochannels, but is far from being resolved. Here, we formulated a theoretical framework for both self-diffusion and electromigration of hydrated monatomic ions in various 2D nanochannels (e.g. graphene, h-BN, g-C3N4, MoS2), by molecular dynamics simulations. The self-diffusivity and mobility of ions in 2D nanochannels both increases linearly with ion-wall distance for small hydrated ions, yet keeps constant for large ones. The underlying mechanism reveals that when ions approach water-layers in nanochannels or possess large hydration shell, their hydration shells become severely distorted. This increases the free energy difference between hydration shell and the surrounding water-layers, water residence time in hydration shell and ion-water friction. Several involving quantitative relations were revealed, with Nernst–Einstein relation validated with both simulations and theoretical derivation.

 From the crewed Apollo missions to the recent Chinese Chang’e landings, the interaction between spacecraft exhaust plumes and lunar soil produces dusty clouds with high-speed particle ejection. Despite varying landing sites, remarkably stable streak patterns were observed, raising questions about their origin. We solved this puzzle by showing that these patterns were driven by Görtler instability from the curved compressed shear layer of the supersonic but surprisingly laminar jet. This instability creates vortical structures that entrain and eject particles. The number of streaks exhibits an interesting scaling with the jet pressure ratio, which can be modeled with linear instability theory and shows excellent agreement with scaled-down experiments, simulations, and actual observations in landing videos. Our findings provide a fluid physics explanation of extraterrestrial landings, highlighting the role of particle-laden flows and paving the way for future missions to optimize landing strategies and mitigate dust cloud effects on equipment and visibility.

OTUD1 deficiency restores cardiac AMPK activity and mitochondrial function in diabetic hearts and cardiomyocytes. Mechanistically, OTUD1 binds to AMPKα2 subunit, deubiquitinates AMPKα2 at K60/K379 sites, and then inhibits AMPKT172 phosphorylation through impeding the interaction of AMPKα2 and its upstream kinase CAMKK2. Finally, silencing AMPKα2 in cardiomyocytes abolishes the cardioprotective effects of OTUD1 deficiency in diabetic mice. In conclusion, this work identifies a direct regulatory DUB of AMPK and presents a OTUD1-AMPK axis in cardiomyocytes for driving DCM. Diabetic cardiomyopathy involves dysregulated protein deubiquitination. Here the authors show that deubiquitinating enzymes OTUD1 knockout prevents cardiac hypertrophy by deubiquitinating AMPKα2 at K60/K379, disrupting CAMKK2-mediated phosphorylation."

 Failure to rapidly diagnose tuberculosis disease (TB) and initiate treatment is a driving factor of TB as a leading cause of death in children. Current TB diagnostic assays have poor performance in children, thus a global priority is the identification of novel non-sputum-based TB biomarkers. Here we use high-throughput proteomics to measure the plasma proteome for 511 children, with and without HIV, and across 4 countries, to distinguish TB status using standardized definitions. By employing a machine learning approach, we derive four parsimonious biosignatures encompassing 3 to 6 proteins that achieve AUCs of 0.87–0.88 and which all reach the minimum WHO target product profile accuracy thresholds for a TB screening test. This work provides insights into the unique host response in pediatric TB disease, as well as a non-sputum biosignature that could reduce delays in TB diagnosis and improve the detection and management of TB in children worldwide.

 Forecasting super El Niño remains challenging, partly due to poor representation of westerly wind bursts (WWBs). We developed an artificial intelligence-based denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to skillfully parameterize WWBs, capturing their joint modulation by oceanic and atmospheric processes. The DDPM-based scheme effectively captures observed WWBs’ characteristics (e.g., frequency, intensity, and spatial center). When implemented in the Community Earth System Model, it outperforms both the control (CTRL, without WWBs parameterization) and conventional warm pool eastern edge (WPEE)-dependent parameterization in predicting intensity and seasonal phase-locking for super El Niños (1982/83, 1997/98, 2015/16). This improvement stems from DDPM’s realistic WWBs representation, correcting CTRL and WPEE’s biases of overly weak and westward-shifted winds during El Niño growth. Consequently, DDPM produces more realistic eastern Pacific sea surface temperature anomaly warming patterns. These findings underscore WWB's accuracy as key to super El Niño prediction and demonstrate machine learning’s potential for WWB's parameterization."

 The impacts of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on the North Atlantic and European sector (NAE) climate are season-dependent and, in some cases, not linear and/or not stationary. Previous studies have found multidecadal variability in ENSO teleconnections to NAE in certain seasons, relating it to changes in the background state. However, the stationarity of the teleconnection and its surface impacts in Europe during early winter remain largely unexplored, a gap intended to be addressed in this study. The observational analysis reveals changes in the teleconnection impacts and mechanisms over recent decades. These changes have strong implications for the assessment of seasonal predictability, hence the performance of the SEAS5 seasonal prediction model is analysed. While SEAS5 does not accurately capture the observed non-stationarity, it displays pronounced multidecadal changes in forecast skill. This implies the emergence of windows of opportunity for seasonal forecasting, where predictability may be higher than initially expected."

This is demonstrated by geochemical and skeletal density data from fossil Porites corals. 
 The history of resilience of organisms over geologic timescales serves as a reference for predicting their response to future conditions. Here we use fossil Porites coral records of skeletal growth and environmental variability from the subtropical Central Paratethys Sea to assess coral resilience to past ocean warming and acidification. These records offer a unique perspective on the calcification performance and environmental tolerances of a major present-day reef builder during the globally warm mid-Miocene CO2 maximum and subsequent climate transition (16 to 13 Ma). We found evidence for up-regulation of the pH and saturation state of the corals’ calcifying fluid as a mechanism underlying past resilience. However, this physiological control on the internal carbonate chemistry was insufficient to counteract the sub-optimal environment, resulting in an extremely low calcification rate that likely affected reef framework accretion. Our findings emphasize the influence of latitudinal seasonality on the sensitivity of coral calcification to climate change.

 Sorption to mineral surfaces is widely regarded as the dominant mechanism of organic matter (OM) preservation, yet it cannot fully explain the varying fates of terrestrially-derived OM during its transport from land to ocean. To investigate this question, here we performed microscale analyses of OM-mineral associations in the clay-sized fraction, a critical carrier for long-term carbon burial and terrestrial OM transport. Across diverse OM sources and mineral compositions, we identify a consistent chemical–spatial coupling: nitrogen-rich OM is closely associated with iron-rich mineral surfaces, while carbon-rich OM is primarily protected within aggregate pores. This coupling suggests that minerals stabilise different OM types through distinct mechanisms, potentially explaining their contrasting responses to environmental changes during transport from land to ocean. Our results challenge the prevailing focus on surface sorption alone and underscore the importance of microscale OM–mineral organisation in controlling the fates of terrestrial OM across Earth’s land–ocean interface.

 In the context of global urbanization, urban expansion significantly affects urban thermal environment. As a key indicator of urbanization, impervious surfaces are widely used to monitor urban growth. However, most existing studies examining thermal environments through impervious surfaces are limited to pixel-scale. Given the complexity and heterogeneity of urban land cover, pixel-scale analyses often fail to accurately capture the thermal effects of impervious surfaces. To address this issue, we propose a universal impervious surface percentage (UISP) model based on Landsat imagery for subpixel-scale impervious surfaces monitoring. We evaluated the relationship between impervious surface percentage (ISP) and surface urban heat islands (SUHI) in four representative Chinese cities—Beijing, Kunming, Shenzhen, and Wuhan—from 2018 to 2023. Results indicate that UISP significantly improves the accuracy of impervious surface estimation over heterogeneous urban landscapes. The deviations of estimated ISP are as much as 0.2 lower than pixel-scale results. In SUHI areas, ISP values exceeded 0.4 to 0.6 higher than in non-SUHI regions. The ISP difference between SUHI levels 1 and 2 was 0.12, and between levels 5 and 6, it was 0.08, suggesting ISP saturation in high SUHI zones.

 Ozone (O3) pollution is a critical environmental issue, especially in rapidly developing industrial regions such as Dushanzi, an oil and petrochemical hub in northwestern China. This paper investigated the first 4-day ozone pollution event in Dushanzi in June 2023. Meteorological parameters, O3 and its precursor concentrations were utilized, combined with the Observation-based model (OBM), Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF), and backward trajectory analysis, to investigate the causes of ozone pollution in the region. The OBM-MCM model assesses the sensitivity of ozone and its generation-loss mechanisms, revealing that O3 is mainly generated through the HO2+NO pathway and lost via the NO2+RO2 pathway. On polluted days, the region falls into the VOCs-NOx collaborative control zone, with an optimal VOCs to NOx reduction ratio of 1:2. Under this reduction ratio, focusing on emissions reduction from the petrochemical industry, particularly controlling OVOCs, would be beneficial for reducing ozone pollution. Based on OFP and PMF analyses, petrochemical emissions were identified as the primary source of O3 pollution, with OVOCs contributing the most to O3 formation. Meteorological data revealed that high temperatures, low humidity and low wind speeds are external triggers of ozone pollution in the region.

 The assimilation of radar reflectivity plays a crucial role in improving the initial fields of numerical weather prediction (NWP). This study employs a one-dimensional (1D) Bayesian scheme to retrieve pseudo-humidity observations from radar reflectivity, which are subsequently assimilated within a three-dimensional variational (3D-Var) framework. The results demonstrate that under dry-biased background field, the joint assimilation of radial velocity and pseudo humidity observations more markedly enhances moisture condition compared to radial velocity assimilation alone, resulting in improved quantitative precipitation forecast skills. Additionally, a valid-time-shifting (VTS) method is implemented to augment a priori database in 1D Bayesian retrieval by introducing sub-ensembles before and after the analysis time, aiming to mitigate temporal and spatial displacement errors in the NWP system. Two assimilation experiments are conducted to evaluate the impact of the VTS scheme on severe convection prediction. It can be found that the VTS method improves consistency in thermodynamic and dynamic structures. The assessments of short-term precipitation forecasts confirm that the application of VTS scheme improves the prediction accuracy of precipitation intensity and spatial distribution."

Writing at higher optical intensities stabilizes the atomic protrusion through light-induced local restructuring, which imposes a higher energy barrier for its return into the metal surface. Fluctuations in these “picocavity” SERS spectra show that while adatom movement is significantly slower under low light intensities, ambient thermal energy still enables them to explore the surrounding energetic landscape. Optical control over single metal atom dynamics opens promising avenues for next-generation microelectronics, atomic-scale imaging, and catalysis."

While the feed spacer, which creates feed channels and governs hydrodynamic properties, is essential in SWM modules, the role of its filament microstructures in membrane fouling remains poorly understood. Here, we delved deeply into how the filament's concave and torsion features influence local hydrodynamic behavior and thus membrane fouling. The findings reveal that the membrane fouling rate could be significantly correlated with both the low-velocity region fraction (r) and the average mass transfer coefficient (kave). Increasing torsional angle (θ) from 0 to 180° reduces r by 30%, enhances kave by 6.1%, and diminishes fouling rate by 13.2%, whereas a further increase of θ to 540° yields insignificant improvements. The enhanced antifouling performance with torsion characteristics comes from a reduced hydraulic stagnant zone and enlarged recirculation region with stronger turbulence. Nonetheless, concave features tend to generate stagnant zones with solute accumulation, resulting in severe membrane fouling, and this detrimental effect is exacerbated with increasing concave depth, even when combined with torsion characteristics. We propose a macro-to-micro path for optimizing feed spacer to combat membrane fouling and enhance the performance of SWM modules for environmental applications."

Previous studies have noted discontinuities in DP propagation with respect to radius, but lacked an explanation for this phenomenon. Our findings reveal that this discontinuity results from the superposition of an outward‐propagating mode driven by inertial‐gravity waves and quasi‐phase‐locked signals associated with the diurnal variations in the TC secondary circulation. DP occurrence exhibits strong latitude dependence. DPs occur more frequently within 0°–30°N latitude, likely driven by inertial‐gravity waves originating from the TC inner core at the tropopause. North of 30°N, DP propagation is primarily influenced by the TC outflow winds, with the DP propagation speed strongly correlated to outflow strength. Additionally, DPs share similarities in characteristics and mechanisms with the offshore propagation of coastal rainfall, both governed by inertial‐gravity waves in lower latitudes and by wind advection at higher latitudes."

However, due to the unclear origin of these precursors and the complexity of the environmental conditions, detecting such preparatory signals remains challenging. Here we present the spatio‐temporal evolution of surface strain measured using fiber‐optic sensing during triaxial experiments in wet and dry conditions. We identify a power‐law distribution of strain increments where the largest magnitude diverges toward failure. This suggests a critical phase transition with the emergence of failure precursors. However, criticality is only observed in dry conditions and disappears with pressurized pore fluids, where the largest strain increment accelerates exponentially, consistent with a first‐order transition. Our results highlight that progressive damage features criticality for failure prediction, but elevated fluid pressures may shift this behavior to abrupt rupture."

 The expression and location of proteins in tissues represent key determinants of health and disease. Although recent advances in multiplexed imaging have expanded the number of spatially accessible proteins1–3, the integration of biological layers (that is, cell structure, subcellular domains and signalling activity) remains challenging. This is due to limitations in the compositions of antibody panels and image resolution, which together restrict the scope of image analysis. Here we present pathology-oriented multiplexing (PathoPlex), a scalable, quality-controlled and interpretable framework. It combines highly multiplexed imaging at subcellular resolution with a software package to extract and interpret protein co-expression patterns (clusters) across biological layers. PathoPlex was optimized to map more than 140 commercial antibodies at 80 nm per pixel across 95 iterative imaging cycles and provides pragmatic solutions to enable the simultaneous processing of at least 40 archival biopsy specimens. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we identified epithelial JUN activity as a key switch in immune-mediated kidney disease, thereby demonstrating that clusters can capture relevant pathological features. PathoPlex was then used to analyse human diabetic kidney disease. The framework linked patient-level clusters to organ disfunction and identified disease traits with therapeutic potential (that is, calcium-mediated tubular stress). Finally, PathoPlex was used to reveal renal stress-related clusters in individuals with type 2 diabetes without histological kidney disease. Moreover, tissue-based readouts were generated to assess responses to inhibitors of the glucose cotransporter SGLT2. In summary, PathoPlex paves the way towards democratizing multiplexed imaging and establishing integrative image analysis tools in complex tissues to support the development of next-generation pathology atlases. Pathology-oriented multiplexing (PathoPlex) represents a framework for widespread access to multiplexed imaging and computational image analysis of clinical specimens at a relatively high throughput and subcellular resolution."

 Earth’s climate feedback quantifies the response of Earth’s energy budget to temperature changes and thus determines climate sensitivity. The climate feedback is largely controlled by water vapor which absorbs both longwave radiation emitted by Earth and shortwave radiation from the Sun. For the clear-sky shortwave water vapor feedback λSW, a gap remains between process understanding and estimates from comprehensive climate models. Therefore, we present a hierarchy of simple models for λSW. We show that λSW is proportional to the change with temperature in the square of atmospheric transmissivity that depends on the atmospheric concentration of water vapor and its ability to absorb shortwave radiation. The global mean λSW is well captured by a simple analytical model that approximates the strong spectral variations in water vapor absorption, whereas its temperature dependence results from spectral details in water vapor absorption. With this study, we expand the conceptual understanding of an important but understudied feedback component."

 Mangroves play a critical role in maintaining biodiversity, supporting global carbon and nitrogen cycles, and contributing to the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Accurate estimation of their nitrogen and phosphorus content is essential for assessing the status of mangrove ecosystems. However, the spectral response characteristics of mangrove leaf nitrogen content (LNC) and leaf phosphorus content (LPC) remain unclear. These knowledge gaps hinder the development of robust predictive models across diverse environmental contexts. To overcome these issues, we collected 375 samples and 16,590 in situ full-spectrum hyperspectral data, and further proposed a novel Global-Fractional Order Sensitivity Analysis (G-FOSA) method. We analyzed for the first time the apparent and deep spectral characteristics of LNC and LPC for four typical mangrove species in China (Avicennia marina, Acanthus ilicifolius, Kandelia candel and Aegiceras corniculatum) using G-FOSA method. This study revealed that the LNC diagnostic wavelengths concentrated in the range of 697 nm–704 nm, while the LPC diagnostic wavelengths were mostly distributed between 691 nm–834 nm and 1869 nm–2236 nm. We developed a mechanism-guided retrieval framework based on these diagnostic wavelengths, and achieved the quantitative inversion from field diagnostic wavelengths to optical satellite (SDGSAT-1 and Sentinel-2) bands. Our experiment results confirmed that SDGSAT-1, the world's first science satellite dedicated to serving the 2030 Agenda for SDGs, performs better in estimating LNC and LPC (R2 = 0.63). Finally, we utilized the advantages of cross-scenario transfer learning technology to design a novel domain adaptive transfer learning (DTL) model, which realized the cross-scenario retrieval of mangrove LNC and LPC across three typical mangrove regions, reducing estimation error (RMSE) by 0.6 %–41.1 % compared to the traditional FTL model.

 Due to its ability to provide day-and-night profiling and high depth resolution, ocean lidar has become an important tool for marine remote sensing. However, a lidar system provides time-based measurements of backscattered photons, where the distance (or depth for vertical profiling) is a product of light speed in water and the time photons pass. When there are significant contributions of multiple scattering in the backscattered signals of ocean lidar, the perceived depth of these measured photons will be deeper than the real depth. Therefore, if the objective of a lidar system is to sense the vertical profile of particles, the present time-based depth profile will not match the real depth profile of particles in the water column. To address this discrepancy, we carried out semi-analytical Monte Carlo simulations for a wide range of water properties (represented by scattering coefficient, b), focusing on Case-1 water, with platforms including spaceborne, airborne, shipborne, and underwater. In the simulation process, it is assumed that the water column is vertically homogeneous, and the influence of sea surface fluctuations is ignored. Based on the simulated data, relationships between the discrepancy and b, as well as the radius of the received footprint on the water surface (rs), are established. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the discrepancy is more sensitive to b than to rs. Further, the impact of the absorption coefficient, scattering phase function, rough sea surface, and vertically non-uniform inherent optical properties on this discrepancy is discussed. Our results not only highlight the significance of considering multiple scattering, particularly for airborne and spaceborne platforms, in sensing the vertical profiles of particles but also provide guidance for interpreting backscattered signals in ocean lidar applications."

 Mangroves, as cradles of biodiversity and blue carbon reservoirs, are facing survival challenges due to climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. Precise and rapid mapping of mangrove forests has thus become highly relevant, which can provide essential information to support the conservation practices of such blue carbon resources. Existing machine learning algorithms for mangrove mapping are incapable of delivering precise cartographic solutions under dynamic tidal conditions because of poor transferability. This study developed a generalized approach for large-area mangrove mapping using a hybrid neural network integrated with a vision transformer to effectively capture representative features. To adapt mangrove mapping to the variety of tidal conditions, a vision transformer architecture was developed by encoding the fusion of three Sentinel-2 bands: Green, NIR, and SWIR. The ground truth dataset for the year 2021 was created from the composited Sentinel-2 images after interpreting Google Earth and drone images, which comprised 88,645 training samples (256 × 256 pixels per sample) and 24,969 test samples. We selected 30 coastal counties as test dataset in China to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed network and produced a 10 m mangrove map that reported a total mangrove area of 28,006.24 ha in China in 2021, yielding an overall accuracy (OA) of 95.91 %.

Despite fluctuations in tide levels captured by Sentinel-2 imagery, the proposed method consistently yielded robust mangrove mapping results, highlighting effective derivation of tidal information. In comparison with previous mapping methods, the superior efficacy of the proposed network is distinctly discernible in distinguishing and delineating mangrove ecosystems in mixed tide regions, presenting prospects for improved monitoring of mangroves at regional and global scales."

Since the above instruments are widely deployed in China, we believe this method has broad application prospects for the improvement of the boundary layer parameterization scheme in numerical forecast models. 
 The accurate wind field observation of the tropical cyclone (TC) boundary layer is of great significance in improving the TC track and intensity forecasting. To investigate the vertical structure of TC boundary layer during the landfall process of Super Typhoon Doksuri, three kinds of instruments, including the coherent Doppler lidar (CDL), radar wind profiler (RWP) and automatic weather station (AWS), are deployed at two sites in Xiamen, Fujian province. The data fusion method is developed to obtain the complete wind speed profiles covering the whole atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) based on the above instruments. The wind speeds in the near-field blind zones of CDL observation are interpolated by combining the AWS measurements at 10 m. The CDL provides high-temporal- and high-spatial-resolution wind speed profiles from tens of meters to its highest detection height. The wind speeds above the highest detection height of the CDL are supplemented with the RWP measurements. The hourly mean wind speed profiles are compared with traditional models. Generally, the wind speed profiles fit well with the power law in the lower part of the ABL before wind speed changes rapidly. However, it would cause a large error (up to 73 %) to describe the exact wind speed profiles with the power law during and after the typhoon's passage, especially when the wind speed is almost constant with height or when wind shear exists. Then, fine structures and evolutionary processes of the wind field in the ABL during the typhoon landfall are investigated. In addition, the wind field distribution and wind speed variation with distance from the typhoon center are statistically analyzed. The joint wind field measurements of CDL, RWP and AWS have the broad application prospects on the dynamics study of the TC boundary layer and the improvement of the boundary layer parameterization scheme in numerical forecast models."

Here, we present a novel method to derive IWC and SR from W-band cloud radar observations, considering the degree of riming. We also investigate the use of the liquid water path (LWP) as a proxy for the occurrence of riming. LWP is easier to measure, so that the method can be applied to both ground-based and space-based instruments. 
 Accurate measurements of snowfall in mid-latitudes and high latitudes are particularly important because snow provides a vital freshwater source and impacts glacier mass balances as well as surface albedo. However, ice water content (IWC) and snowfall rates (SRs) are hard to measure due to their high spatial variability and the remoteness of polar regions. In this study, we present novel ice water content–equivalent radar reflectivity (IWC–Ze) and snowfall rate–equivalent radar reflectivity (SR–Ze) relations for 40° slanted and vertically pointing W-band radar. The relations are derived from joint in situ snowfall and remote sensing (W-band radar and radiometer) data from the SAIL site (Colorado, USA) and validated for sites in Hyytiälä (Finland), Ny-Ålesund (Svalbard), and Eriswil (Switzerland). In addition, gauge measurements from SAIL and Hyytiälä are used as an independent reference for validation. We show the dependence of IWC–Ze and SR–Ze on riming, which we utilize to reduce the spread in the IWC–Ze and SR–Ze spaces. Normalized root mean square errors (NRMSEs) are below 25 % for IWC>0.1 g m−3. For SR, the NRMSE is below 70 % over the whole SR range. We also present relations using liquid water path as a proxy for the occurrence of riming, which can be applied to both ground-based and space-borne radar–radiometer instruments. The latter is demonstrated using the example of the proposed ESA Earth Explorer 11 candidate mission WIVERN. With this approach, NRMSEs are below 75 % for IWC>0.1 g m−3 and below 80 % for SR>0.2 mm h−1."

Our study introduces updated datasets tracking changes in natural gas supply, usage, and transmission within the EU27&amp;UK. We discovered that Europe adapted to losing Russian gas by increasing LNG (liquefied natural gas) imports and shifting to renewables. Our insights could shape future energy policies and climate research. 
 The 2022 invasion of Ukraine by Russia triggered a significant energy crisis in the EU27 (27 EU member countries) and UK (hereafter EU27&UK), leading to profound changes in their natural gas supply, transmission, and consumption dynamics. To analyze those pattern shifts, we first update our natural gas supply dataset, EUGasSC, with daily country- and sector-specific supply sources. We then provide a newly constructed daily intra-EU (European Union) natural gas transmission dataset, EUGasNet, with specified supply sources utilizing the ENTSOG (European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas) and EUGasSC data. To further understand the economic and climatic impacts, we finally developed EUGasImpact, a daily dataset with sector-specific driving factors of consumption changes based on change attribution models using multiple open datasets. Those datasets are available on the Zenodo platform: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11175364 (Zhou et al., 2024). On the supply side, Russian gas supply to the EU27&UK was cut by 87.8 % (976.8 TW h per winter) during the post-invasion winters compared to the previous winters. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports became the largest gas supply source, rising from 20.7 % to 37.5 % of the total gas supply. Our intra-EU gas transmission analysis showed that the gas transmission network was adjusted to mitigate the large gas shortfalls in Germany and distribute LNG arrivals. Total gas consumption fell by 19.0 %, which was driven by (1) consumer behavioral changes in household heating (contributed to 29 % of the total reduction; the following numbers are also percentage contributions to the total reduction); (2) drops in industrial production (25 %); (3) heating drops due to the warmer winter temperatures (11 %); (4) shifts towards renewable electricity including wind, solar, and hydro (10 %); (5) a decline in gas-powered electricity generation (9 %); (6) adoption of energy-efficient heat pumps for industrial gas heating (4 %); (7) shifts towards non-renewable electricity including coal, oil, and nuclear (1 %); and (8) other unmodeled factors (11 %). We evaluated the benefits and costs associated with these pattern changes and discussed whether these changes would potentially lead to long-term structural changes in the EU energy dynamics. Our datasets and these insights can provide valuable perspectives for understanding the consequences of this energy crisis and the challenges to future energy security in the EU."

While deep learning offers automation potential, it is limited by the lack of labeled data. We present a workflow to simulate geologically reasonable 3D seismic volumes with diverse paleochannels, generating a large-scale labeled dataset. Field applications demonstrate its effectiveness. The dataset and codes are publicly available to support future research. 
 Identifying paleochannels in 3D seismic volumes (seismic paleochannel interpretation) is essential for georesource development and offering insights into paleoclimate conditions.  However,  it remains a labor-intensive and time-consuming task.  Deep learning has shown great promise in automating seismic paleochannel interpretation with high efficiency and accuracy,  as demonstrated in similar image segmentation tasks in computer vision (CV). Yet,  unlike the CV domain,  seismic exploration lacks a comprehensive labeled dataset for paleochannels,  significantly hindering the development,  application,  and evaluation of deep learning methods in this field.  Manual labeling of paleochannels in 3D seismic volumes is tedious and subjective,  potentially leading to mislabeling that degrades deep learning model's performance.  To address this,  we propose a workflow to generate a synthetic seismic dataset,  cigChannel,  consisting of 1600 seismic volumes with over 10 000 labeled paleochannels.  Each volume has a size of 256×256×256 samples. This is the largest dataset to date for seismic paleochannel interpretation,  featuring geologically reasonable seismic volumes with accurately labeled meandering channels,  tributary channel networks,  and submarine canyons.  A convolutional neural network (simplified from U-Net) trained on this dataset achieves F1 scores of 0.52, 0.73, and 0.63 in identifying meandering channels,  tributary channel networks,  and submarine canyons in three field seismic volumes,  respectively.  However,  the synthetic seismic volumes in the cigChannel dataset still lack the variability and realism of field seismic data,  potentially affecting the deep learning model's generalizability.  To facilitate further research,  we publicly release the dataset (Wang et al., 2024, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10791151),  data generation codes, and trained U-Net model (Wang, 2024, https://github.com/wanggy-1/cigChannel, last access: 5 July 2025),  aiming to advance deep learning approaches for seismic paleochannel interpretation."

Monitoring from remote sensing is promising but there are limitations due to the diversity of marine debris. The open-access MADLib collection, with 24889 hyperspectral reflectances from 3032 diverse debris samples, is anticipated to support algorithm and sensor development based on well-curated representative spectra of marine debris. We also discuss gaps and propose improved metadata schemes for expanding the living MADLIB collection. 
 Marine debris is a ubiquitous and growing threat to environmental and human health. Efforts to monitor and mitigate marine debris pollution face many challenges. A primary limitation is the absence of standardized methodologies for monitoring capabilities due to the complex and diverse physical and chemical properties of marine debris. Variabilities include object size, apparent color, polymer type, weathering, and aqueous state. Despite the challenges in object characteristics, advances in remote sensing methods are showing promise for detecting marine debris across local to global scales. Algorithms are needed to link remotely sensed observations with relevant characteristics of marine debris to fully realize this potential. Although more optical measurements of marine debris reflectance are becoming available for algorithm development, inconsistencies in data curation remains an obstacle. Variations in data processing and inconsistent metadata hinder efforts to develop robust, generalizable algorithms for marine debris detection. To address this, we present the well-curated MArine Debris hyperspectral reference Library collection (MADLib) containing 24889 spectra from 3032 samples. All optical measurements are available in open access via https://doi.org/10.4121/059551d3-2383-4e20-af2d-011c9a59d3ac (Ohall et al., 2025). MADLib demonstrates the importance of open-science and open-access datasets, as it compiles and harmonizes spectral data collected from publicly accessible datasets and individual research projects. Consistent methods were applied for data standardization, quality assurance, and integration. We also propose a robust protocol for generating metadata tailored to marine debris and ocean color remote sensing applications. MADLib possesses spectra of a wide range of marine debris materials including different polymer types, color, size, weathering, and aqueous states. Here, we analyze the metadata associated with the spectra to identify sampling gaps and propose considerations for future work.

 Understanding the impact of climate change on thermohaline dynamics in the western Mediterranean Sea is essential for assessing shifts in regional circulation and water mass formation. This study analyzes data from twelve summer oceanographic surveys conducted between 2009 and 2022 along the Ligurian and Tyrrhenian continental shelf. Results reveal a decadal-scale warming and salinification of both surface and intermediate layers, leading to enhanced water column stratification. On the northern Sicilian shelf, AtlanticWater exhibited a salinity increase of +0.02 yr−1 and a potential temperature rise of +0.40 °C yr−1 between 2011 and 2022, driven by sustained surface warming and advection of Ionian Surface Water from the eastern Mediterranean. This warmer and saltier water mass also affected intermediate depths, modifying vertical density gradients. The influence of Ionian Surface Water peaked around 2016, coinciding with the progressive warming of Tyrrhenian Intermediate Water due to the absence of strong winter cooling after 2014. These hydrographic changes are linked to the Adriatic–Ionian Bimodal Oscillating System and the transition of the Northern Ionian Gyre from a cyclonic to an anticyclonic state, which modulates the inflow of intermediate waters through the Sicily and Messina Straits. On the Ligurian shelf, Western Intermediate Water showed moderate warming (+0.06 °C yr−1) until 2017, followed by cooling, and a salinity increase until 2019. These findings underscore the importance of inter-basin connectivity and the need for integrated monitoring and modeling to understand and anticipate climate-driven variability in the Mediterranean Sea."

DBPs are of public concern due to their carcinogenic and genotoxic effects and adverse effects observed in many epidemiologic studies. Formation mechanisms have been studied in order to identify precursors, reaction intermediates, and reaction kinetics and to predict new classes of DBPs. By understanding formation mechanisms, steps can be taken to remove DBP precursors and adjust treatment conditions to minimize DBP formation. This paper presents a critical review of formation mechanisms for eight classes of DBPs, including trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs), haloketones (HKs), haloacetaldehydes (HALs), haloacetonitriles (HANs), haloacetamides (HAMs), halonitromethanes (HNMs), and nitrosamines (NAs) from the popular disinfectants chlorine, chloramine, and ozone. Important precursors in the formation of many of these DBPs include phenolic, β-dicarbonyl, and oxopentadioic acid groups found in humic NOM species. Likewise, amino acids are also precursors for several classes of DBPs. HANs can form by chloramination of aldehydes, and HAMs can form from the hydrolysis of HANs. HNMs can form by the oxidation/halogenation of amines as well as by nitration and halogenation of humic substances in the presence of nitrite. Preozonation followed by chlorine or chloramine can significantly increase HNM formation. Finally, dichloramine and aqueous oxygen are important reactants in the formation of nitrosamines from chloramine. Nitrosamines can also be formed by N,N-dimethylsulfamide. Detailed formation mechanisms for 8 classes of drinking water DBPs formed by chlorine, chloramine, and ozone are presented"

Herein, a CuSO4/TiO2 catalyst with dual-reaction channels was developed for 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE) oxidation, featuring S═O–H sites for Cl desorption and Cu–O–S sites for intermediate oxidation. It achieved 90% conversion at 251 °C, with reaction rates 8.3 and 11.0 times higher than those of SO42–/TiO2 and CuO/TiO2, respectively. The hybridization of Cu 3d–O 2p enhanced electron transfer of O → Cu, accelerating 1,2-DCE oxidation via the C═C–OH → – COO/C═O → CO pathway. Meanwhile, the Cl species generated after C–Cl dissociation combined with S═O–H and desorbed in the form of HCl, avoiding Cl binding to intermediates and thus inhibiting the generation of CH3Cl, CH2Cl2, CHCl3, CCl4, CH2ClCHCl2, and CCl2CCl2. Notably, the S═O–H species as a dynamic H transfer site could capture the H of the activated intermediates after being consumed by the Cl species during the reaction, restoring the S═O–H structure and achieving stable desorption of Cl species.

During the PAU crossing, DMSP observed both precipitating electrons and ions (protons) and a plasma drift up to ∼5,000 m/s with a strong shear. Simultaneous ground‐based all‐sky imaging at South Pole captured the dynamic behavior of the PAU that propagated in an anti‐sunward direction at a phase speed of ∼250 m/s. The solar wind conditions during the PAU were a high solar wind speed (∼700 km/s), an intense southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF, approximately −40 nT), and a high density (37 cm−3).

These banded structures were previously attributed to bounce resonance between particles and standing Alfvén waves generated by moon‐magnetospheric interactions. Here, we show that this explanation is inconsistent with key observational features, and propose an alternative interpretation: the bands are remote signatures of particle absorption at the moons. In this scenario, whether a particle encounters the moon before reaching Juno depends on the number of bounce cycles it undergoes within a fixed drift segment determined by the moon‐spacecraft separation. Therefore, the absorption bands are expected to appear at discrete, equally‐spaced velocities. This is largely consistent with the observations, though discrepancies remain, possibly due to spacecraft charging and/or finite data resolution. This finding improves our understanding of moon‐plasma interactions and may help constrain Jovian magnetospheric models."

 The Apelin receptor (APLNR), a class A G-protein coupled receptor, plays a crucial role during cardiovascular development and tumor angiogenesis. To understand its spatiotemporal activity in health and disease is fundamental for the development of drugs to manipulate its activation state. To obtain this understanding, here we develop a tool box of various APLNR conformation biosensors, based on FRET, BRET and the conformation-sensitive fluorophore circularly permuted GFP (cpGFP), with further focus on its in vivo application. We demonstrate the functionality of our biosensors by pharmacological characterization and signal transduction analysis in vitro. Two APLNR-cpGFP biosensors show superior signal-to-noise ratio and are further analyzed for their in vivo applicability. In zebrafish embryos, APLNR-cpGFP biosensors are able to bind both endogenous ligands, Apelin and Apela, and visualize endogenous Aplnr activity in growing blood vessels. Moreover, we are able to measure an Apelin ligand gradient across cellular distances in vivo. Hence, these APLNR conformation biosensors are powerful tools to resolve the spatiotemporal Apelin signaling activity in health and disease.

Here, the authors identify neural crest-specific and somite-specific splicing complexes that confer distinct susceptibility to splicing perturbation. 
 How the ubiquitously expressed splicing factors specifically regulate neural crest (NC) development and enhance their vulnerability to splicing perturbations remain poorly understood. Here, we show that NC-specific DLC1, partnering with SF3B1-PHF5A splicing complex, are crucial for determining avian trunk NC cell fate by regulating the splicing of NC specifiers SOX9 and SNAI2 pre-mRNAs rather than their upstream regulators BMP4, WNT1, and PAX7. Mechanistically, SF3B1-PHF5A binds to the intronic branch site (BS) sequences of all factors, while DLC1 interacts with a specific motif near the BS sequences of SOX9 and SNAI2, thereby determining their functional specificity in NC specification. Moreover, DLC1 increases NC cells’ vulnerability to splicing modulator pladienolide B (PB) by reducing the binding capacity of the SF3B1-PHF5A splicing complex to the shorter length of both SOX9 intron 2 and SNAI2 intron 1, which possess weaker polypyrimidine tract 3’ of the BS sequence, resulting in intron retention and loss of NC progenitors. Conversely, somite specific SLU7-SF3B1-PHF5A splicing complex regulates SOX9 and SNAI2 expression and imparts resistance to PB. Our data reveal the cell-type specific splicing complexes with distinct vulnerabilities to PB, highlighting the critical role of the DLC1-SF3B1-PHF5A in determining trunk NC cell fate and enhancing its susceptibility to splicing perturbation.

 The impact of Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) anomalies on the global climate system has received considerable attention in recent decades. Observations and model simulations indicate that winter Arctic SIC anomalies in the Greenland-Barents Seas significantly influence on the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). However, whether this influence is symmetric remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the influence of SIC anomalies on the subsequent ENSO is asymmetric. An increase in SIC significantly affects the development of El Niño, whereas a decrease in SIC has only a weak influence on La Niña. Specifically, a winter SIC increase in the Greenland-Barents Seas induces deep Arctic cooling, which triggers an atmospheric wave train propagating to the subtropical North Pacific. The associated subtropical cyclonic anomaly leads to North Pacific Meridional Mode-like sea surface temperature (SST) warming in spring, which extends to the tropical Pacific via the wind-evaporation-SST feedback in the following summer and subsequently enhances El Niño development by tropical air-sea interaction processes. In contrast, a winter SIC decrease is accompanied by shallow Arctic warming, which is insufficient to generate an atmospheric wave train to modify the subtropical North Pacific oceanic and atmospheric states, and thus has a weak influence on the La Niña development. Further analysis suggests that the asymmetric impacts of Arctic sea ice anomalies on subtropical North Pacific air-sea conditions and ENSO events may also be partly due to differences in the atmospheric mean state between high and low SIC years. This study highlights the asymmetric impact of Arctic SIC anomalies on ENSO and tropical climate, emphasizing the need to consider these asymmetries when assessing global climate responses to Arctic sea ice variability."

 Understanding the processes controlling the fate of carbon dioxide in deep saline aquifers is critical for safe large-scale carbon storage. We describe an experimental model for the dissolution of capillary-trapped carbon dioxide. Our experiment involves a two-layer porous medium: the upper layer contains glass beads, saturated salt solution and salt powder, which is an analogue of the capillary-trapped carbon dioxide, while the lower layer contains glass beads and unsaturated solution. Convective fingers develop as fluid is exchanged between the layers. The rising fingers are arrested once they dissolve sufficient salt to become saturated, while the descending fingers gradually increase the salinity of the lower layer fluid. We develop a model of the finger motion and the non-linear dissolution process, which agrees with the experiments. We predict that a 1–10 m-thick layer of capillary-trapped carbon dioxide will dissolve into a region of aquifer water 30–100 m deep, in time scales of 10–1000 years.

 The Paris Agreement legally commits the international community to keep anthropogenic global warming well below 2.0 °C, while efforts shall be made to hold the 1.5 °C-line. Under climate business as usual, however, the transgression of those lines will happen in the next few decades, causing major adaptation challenges. Fully-fledged Earth System Models are usually employed for concrete overshoot-timing projections, yet they are not only computationally expensive, but their internal variability is model dependent, which may significantly distort (and invalidate) their projections. Here we present, as an alternative, a purely data-driven approach based on the persistence properties of the observed global temperatures. We quantify, in a probabilistic way, the natural variability that must be superimposed on the anthropogenic trends in order to retrieve the observed warming behavior. When assuming that the anthropogenic warming continues at the current rate, we actually arrive at comparable overshoot timing estimates as the Earth System Models and provide an explanation for this finding. Since the two approaches are independent, they support each other strongly and highlight the need for an effective overshoot management.

 Long-term river discharge time series are essential for assessing water availability, seasonal variability, and the impacts of climate change. However, in-situ data do not ensure continuity and large-scale availability, as they are constrained by the limitations of monitoring networks, which are affected by high maintenance costs, geopolitical factors, and the remoteness of many river basins. Satellite remote sensing offers a valuable alternative, with multispectral data providing information on river discharge dynamics. Nevertheless, also satellite data suffer discontinuity, being periodically decommissioned and substituted by sensors with different characteristics.This study applies and refines the Calibration-Measurement (CM) approach across 54 river sites worldwide, using 10 different multispectral satellite products from 8 satellite sensors to examine long time series of data. The methodology optimizes the selection of reflectance indices based on local hydrological conditions, evaluating the best procedure to obtain river discharge proxies according to the specific flow regimes and climatic condition. Multi-mission data are then combined to improve temporal coverage and accuracy, obtaining long-term timeseries of river discharge proxies. A new uncalibrated procedure is also introduced to extract river discharge information in sites with decommissioned stations or to obtain the CM proxies in ungauged basins.Results demonstrate that integrating multiple satellite sources substantially improves river discharge estimation, due to factor such as the superior performance of high-resolution sensors (e.g., Sentinel-2) over coarse-resolution datasets (e.g. MODIS) in narrow rivers, and the complementary value of MODIS finer temporal resolution. The proposed merging approach enhances data consistency and reduces gaps while maintaining good performance values, while the uncalibrated method proves effective in many cases but remains challenging for frozen rivers, cloud-prone regions and areas with a low ratio between river width and satellite sensor spatial resolution. Specifically, after the application of a Cumulative Distribution Function Merging (CDF) matching to obtain river discharge estimates from CM proxies, the average and maximum value of Spearman's correlation for the calibrated approaches are respectively 0.78 and 0.92 whereas for uncalibrated approach are 0.55 and 0.89; in terms of Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) the average and maximum value are 0.41 and 0.85 for calibrated approach and 0.29 and 0.8 for the uncalibrated one.These findings highlight the potential of multi-sensor approaches for global river discharge monitoring and lay the groundwork for future operational applications."

 The Leaf Area Index (LAI) is an essential parameter for assessing vegetation growth. LAI derived from optical data can suffer from gaps caused by cloud cover. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) presents a solution with its all-weather observation capability. To address these issues, this study proposes a new deep learning approach for reconstructing time series LAI using SAR and optical data in two steps. Firstly, the two-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network-Transformer (2D CNN-Transformer) is applied to bridge SAR and optical data. Secondly, the 2D CNN-Transformer predicted LAI and the Sentinel-2 LAI are input into the Enhanced Deep Convolutional Model for Spatiotemporal Image Fusion (EDCSTFN) model to further improve the accuracy. The novelty lies in a two-step framework combining a 2D CNN-Transformer for spatiotemporal feature extraction and a deep learning fusion algorithm refining accurate LAI reconstruction. Results showed that the 2D CNN-Transformer achieved a higher accuracy (R2 = 0.64, RMSE = 0.38 m2/m2) in establishing a relationship between SAR and optical data, compared to 1D CNN, 2D CNN-LSTM, and 1D CNN-Transformer. In the second step, the EDCSTFN reconstructed LAI achieved the highest accuracy of an R2 of 0.81 and an RMSE of 0.22 m2/m2, with an average R2 of 0.61 and RMSE of 0.37 m2/m2 across croplands and forests in millions of pixels, further improving the accuracy based on the first step. The approach effectively fills gaps in spatial details and achieves a more continuous spatial distribution. The proposed approach demonstrates good generalizability in millions of pixels under frequent cloud cover and complex surface conditions and provides a new strategy for the fusion of optical and SAR data."

This study assesses the relationship between PM2.5 exposure and asthma ED visits in Fresno from 2005 to 2015, with a focus on vulnerable populations, including children, racial minorities, and those living in commercial areas. A time-stratified case-crossover design was used to analyze the impact of PM2.5 on asthma ED visits. Data on ED visits were sourced from California's Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI), and air pollution data from the EPA's Air Quality System (AQS). Statistical models were adjusted for meteorological variables and additional pollutants (NO2, CO, and SO2). The study identified 7778 asthma-related ED visits. PM2.5 exposure was significantly associated with an increase in ED visits (Lag 0–14, OR = 1.135) during the cold season (November–February) when concentrations of PM2.5 were the highest. Stratified analyses showed elevated risks for individuals in commercial areas, females, and Hispanic and Black populations. Children aged 2–5 years were particularly vulnerable, while older adults showed lower sensitivity.

 Peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), a key secondary pollutant, plays a vital role in atmospheric chemistry and photochemical smog formation. In this study, PAN concentrations were measured at an urban site during the peak photochemical pollution period in June 2022. The study examined PAN's production, loss processes, regional transport, and sensitivity to precursors within the context of photochemical pollution events.

The diurnal variation of PAN exhibited a typical unimodal pattern, indicating enhanced photochemical activity during pollution episodes. Conditional probability analysis revealed that peak concentrations of ozone (O3) and PAN predominantly originated from the north-to-east sector, whereas nitrous acid maxima occurred near the observation site under low wind speeds. PAN thermal decomposition was more pronounced on clean days, resulting in a shorter atmospheric lifetime compared to pollution events. Observation-based model simulations further demonstrated that PAN production and loss rates were significantly higher during pollution episodes than on clean days. Temperature emerged as a key factor driving PAN's diurnal pattern. Additionally, relative incremental reactivity analysis indicated that PAN formation was highly sensitive to anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particularly alkenes. This study provides valuable insights into PAN behavior under severe photochemical pollution conditions, contributing to a better understanding of urban air quality and photochemical smog formation mechanisms."

 BackgroundThere are limited studies of children's long-term health impacts from landscape fire smoke emissions, despite the increasing threat of these events. This study investigates long-term hospital utilisation following the Hazelwood mine fire (Feb–March 2014), in a cohort of children exposed during infancy.MethodsBirth records of all children born in the Latrobe Valley, Australia, and aged under two during the fire (n = 1788), were linked to emergency department (ED) presentations and hospital admissions for a five-year period immediately following the event. Associations between modelled terciles of fire-specific particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) and presentations/admissions, for all causes as well as for specific diagnostic groupings (respiratory, infectious, allergic), were assessed using a recurrent events survival analysis approach.ResultsChildren with medium (HR 1.16, 95 %CI 1.06–1.28) or high exposure (HR 1.11, 95 %CI 1.01–1.21) had higher rates of overall presentations to the ED than those with low exposure. Children with medium exposure still had marginally higher rates of presentation to the ED, after exclusion of diagnoses unlikely to have a clinical connection to smoke (HR 1.13, 95 %CI 1.00–1.27).ConclusionsWe observed an increase during a five-year period in overall ED presentations in children with higher exposure to smoke during infancy, although these results were attenuated after adjusting for the distance between the residential area and the hospital. Conversely, increases found in presentations for respiratory and infectious conditions in the year following the fire, were no longer apparent when investigated over a five-year period."

 This paper presents a new three-dimensional (3D) adaptive lightning progressing stochastic model (ALPSM) that incorporates the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) method to enable a compatible simulation of large-domain intracloud discharges and near-ground lightning leader attachment processes. A new self-consistent charge neutrality maintenance algorithm is proposed, which considers the internal electric field of the lightning channel and ensures synchronized adjustments of the channel potential with the ambient potential. The model successfully reproduces the reported leader connection scenarios during the negative cloud-to-ground (−CG) lightning attachment process and analyzes the spatiotemporal evolutionary process of leader propagation and channel potential variation. The simulation results reveal a series of interesting phenomena in leader propagation before grounding: initial bidirectional vertical propagation during channel potential rapidly adjusting from the initial value to the average of the positive and negative charge regions; horizontal multibranch propagation within charge regions where the most concentrated height of horizontal propagation corresponds to the vertical electric field zero-crossing points; and downward negative leader vertical propagation during the rapidly increasing channel potential period. The ALPSM model advances the lightning stochastic model simulation owing to the charge neutrality constraint and adaptive mesh refinement in large three-dimensional domains, which provides a further method for the lightning attachment process simulation."

However, the current AQI in India does not consider the health impacts of exposure to air pollutants, necessitating the development of air quality health index (AQHI). Here, we proposed a framework for developing city-specific AQHI that better reflects local air quality and associated health risks using air pollution and health data from two polluted and densely populated cities in north India—Delhi and Varanasi (Delhi: 2013–2017; Varanasi: 2009–2016). We also constructed a pooled AQHI by combining data from both cities. Using concentrations of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide, and ozone, we applied generalized additive models with a quasi-Poisson link, using daily mortality counts as the outcome, excluding suicide and accidental deaths. A 10 µg m−3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with mortality increases of 0.17% (95% CI: 0.01–0.34) in Varanasi, 0.20% (95% CI: 0.1–0.29) in Delhi, and 0.16% (95% CI: 0.08–0.24) in the pooled model. The city-specific AQHI classified 21.8% of days in Delhi as ‘Satisfactory’ versus 18.2% by the pooled index, while 24.2% of days were ‘Poor’ compared to 30.1% under the pooled index. In Varanasi, 6.8% of days were ‘Good’ under the city-specific AQHI, compared to 9.3% by the pooled index, with 15.7% of days classified as ‘Poor’ versus 19.3% by the pooled index. Our results suggest that a single-pooled AQHI may misrepresent local air quality and associated health risks. Since AQHI values are derived from excess mortality risk estimates, a city-specific AQHI ensures a more accurate reflection of local pollution-related health impacts, supporting targeted public health interventions. We recommend accessibility of health data to enable developing AQHI for non-attainment cities in India and use it to track progress towards cleaner air."

This study introduces a quantitative method for determining albedo thresholds to delineate areas of dark ice, which detects abrupt changes in the mean and linear trends in time series of weather station albedo measurements in documented dark ice areas. Four different stages of albedo change during the melt season are easily identified within data derived from program for monitoring of the Greenland Ice Sheet and the Greenland climate network automatic weather station located in dark ice areas. The third stage is defined as the dark ice period, during which the albedo decline rate is lowest, gradually converging to the minimum annual value. The derived broadband albedo thresholds are α < 0.451 and 0.431 for use with discrete data mapping and linear trend analysis, respectively. We recommend that the latter threshold is used because it can better indicate albedo trend changes. The thresholds were applied to harmonized Landsat and Sentinel 2 ice albedo and MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MOD10A1 albedo products to analyze dark ice variations at local (30 m) and regional (500 m) scales on the ice sheet. Our findings reveal notable inter-annual and daily variations in dark ice areas, in line with previous studies.

This study addresses a significant knowledge gap by investigating seasonal vegetation-drought sensitivity using multiple vegetation indicators and the influence of hydroclimatic factors. Our results show vegetation-drought sensitivity peaks in spring, rising from 0.2 in summer to 0.6, with drought-prone areas expanding from 40% to 60%. Along with drought-vegetation sensitivities, the other hydroclimatic factor’s role played a wide range of dependency on the phenological stages of vegetation. For instance, a statistically significant positive correlation between increasing soil moisture–temperature coupling and decreased vegetation growth was detected from spring to summer in Pakistan and India, with an average sensitivity of 0.2–0.6 in all seasons. Vapor pressure deficit dominates vegetation responses, especially in summer and autumn, with central and northwestern croplands showing higher sensitivity, while humid northeastern parts remain resilient. Elevated aCO2 amplifies drought effects in the spring, highlighting the vital role of seasonal water balance and hydroclimatic dynamics. Policy-makers should integrate these insights into regional drought management and climate adaptation strategies to support sustainable agricultural practices and ecosystem conservation."

 Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions represent a pivotal driver of global climate change, with vehicular emissions, particularly from light-duty vehicles, emerging as a prominent source of GHGs. Despite extensive research on gaseous pollutants, studies on GHG emissions within the framework of carbon neutrality remain scarce. This study delves into the emission characteristics of three primary GHGs (carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O)) from various light-duty vehicles, encompassing conventional gasoline and hybrid vehicles and bi-fuel taxis. As anticipated, with advancements in emission standards and powertrains, vehicular GHG emissions have significantly decreased. However, our findings also revealed surprising trends. While engine technology upgrades reduced CO2, they unexpectedly increased CH4 and N2O emissions. Additionally, hot starts, beneficial for reducing CO2 and CH4 emissions, caused heightened N2O emissions, which is noteworthy under operating conditions with frequent start–stop events. Intriguingly, compressed natural gas (CNG), generally perceived as cleaner, increased CH4 emissions. Regarding the impact of three-way-catalyst (TWC) converters on GHG emissions, under “TWC deteriorated” conditions, N2O emissions from CNG-powered vehicles were approximately 3 times higher than those under “TWC worked” conditions, which can be attributed to the significant increase in nitrogen oxides (NOx). Considering the global warming potential (GWP), the “TWC deteriorated” scenario paradoxically decreased GWP values, highlighting the complex interaction between emission control technologies and their environmental impacts. This study provides crucial insights into vehicular GHG emissions, which are essential for developing effective strategies aimed at mitigating emissions and enhancing the efficiency of emission control systems."

The methodology is described, and the quality of the wind and temperature observations is evaluated against radiosonde and other aircraft observations. 
 Wind and temperature observations from aircraft are of major importance for aviation meteorology and numerical weather prediction (NWP). The European Meteorological Aircraft Derived Data Centre (EMADDC) system processes aircraft surveillance data received from air traffic control (ATC) and other partners and converts them into upper-air observations of wind and temperature. Only so-called Mode-S Enhanced Surveillance (Mode-S EHS) data can be used because these data contain the air vector and ground vector of the aircraft from which a wind vector can be inferred. Temperature is derived from true airspeed and Mach number measurements. To produce high-quality observations, the data are processed in three steps: pre-processing, processing, and post-processing. The pre-processing is needed to obtain high-quality information and to calculate several correction values for correcting temperature observations and heading values. Processing converts the aircraft data into meteorological information, and finally post-processing guarantees that only high-quality information is made available.The EMADDC system processes around 75×106 surveillance observations per day and produces over 55×106 observations of quality-controlled wind observations and 32×106 temperature observations in the European airspace per day. The average age of the observation is around 5 to 10 min, depending on the method of data delivery (files via ftp or streaming constantly).The quality of the observations produced is verified by comparing these observation to other upper-air wind and temperature observations from radiosondes and Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay (AMDAR) and comparing them with NWP data. The quality of wind observations is almost identical to AMDAR, and the quality of the temperature of EMADDC observations is lower but with a bias of around zero, while AMDAR exhibits a positive bias of 0.5 K.This paper presents the EMADDC (R2.2) system, operational since 2019."

 Denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) convert reactive nitrogen to inert N2 and play vital roles in nitrogen removal in coastal and marine ecosystems, weakening the adverse effects caused by terrestrial excessive nitrogen inputs. Given the importance of denitrification and anammox in the nitrogen cycle, several studies have measured denitrification and anammox through intact core incubations across different systems, and nitrogen loss processes are affected by a series of environmental factors such as organic carbon, nitrate, dissolved oxygen and temperature. However, a global synthesis of actual nitrogen loss rates is lacking, and how environmental factors regulate nitrogen loss remains unclear. Therefore, we have compiled a database of nitrogen loss rates, including denitrification and anammox in coastal and marine systems, from the published literature. This database includes 473, 466 and 255 measurements for total nitrogen loss, denitrification and anammox, respectively. This work deepens our understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of denitrification, anammox and the relative contribution of anammox to total nitrogen loss, and their corresponding environmental controls.

Robertson,SynRad v1.0: a radar forward operator to simulate synthetic weather radar observations from volcanic ash clouds,"A numerical model that simulates the measurement processes behind the ground-based radars used to detect volcanic ash clouds is introduced. Using weather radars to detect volcanic clouds is not ideal, as fine ash particles are smaller than raindrops and remain undetected. We evaluate the performance of weather radars to study ash clouds and to identify optimal frequencies that balance the trade-off between a higher return signal and the higher path attenuation that comes at these higher frequencies. 
 In this work, SynRad, a new radar forward operator for the Active Tracer High-Resolution Atmospheric Model (ATHAM) volcanic plume model is introduced. The operator is designed  to generate synthetic radar signals from ground-based scanning weather radars for volcanic ash clouds simulated by ATHAM. A key novelty of SynRad is a ray-tracing module that traces radar beams from the antenna to the ash cloud and calculates path attenuation due to hydrometeors and ash. The operator is designed to be compatible with the one-moment microphysics scheme in ATHAM, but it can easily be extended to  other one- or two-moment schemes in ATHAM or any weather prediction model. The operator can be used to test candidate locations at which to operationally deploy portable high-frequency or multi-frequency (from long to short wavelength) scanning radar(s). An optimal frequency or frequencies (for a multi-frequency radar) can be identified that balance the trade-off between a stronger return signal and the increased path attenuation that comes at these higher frequencies. A case study of the eruption of the Raikoke volcano in 2019 is used to evaluate the performance of SynRad. The measurement process of a C-band radar is simulated using SynRad, and the operator was able to generate realistic fields of the equivalent radar reflectivities, echo tops, and vertical maximum intensities. Even though higher-frequency microwave weather radars (K-band and higher) have been used to observe volcanic activity, they may not operate in scanning mode. Ideally, higher-frequency microwave radars will be designed and constructed specifically for monitoring volcanic eruptions. This is certainly possible in the coming years, making feasibility studies on the capability of higher-frequency radars timely."

Detection and attribution studies rely on pre-industrial control simulations and historical simulations, which will be part of the Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima (DECK) set of simulations for CMIP7. In addition, we identify the three highest-priority single-forcing experiments for CMIP7 to be run as “Assessment Fast Track” simulations in support of the Seventh Assessment Report of the IPCC: simulations with natural forcings only, anthropogenic well-mixed greenhouse gases only and anthropogenic aerosols only. Beyond this, the DAMIP v2.0 experimental design includes full-column ozone-only simulations and land-use-only simulations, such that the set of individual forcing experiments, when these are considered together, represents the full set of historical forcings. While concentration-driven simulations are prioritised for attribution, emissions-driven versions of the DAMIP experiments are also proposed to support understanding of the influence of carbon-cycle feedbacks on the simulated responses to individual forcings."

Hawkins,Techno-Economic Analysis and Life Cycle Assessment of Alternative Fuels for Locomotives in the U.S. Freight Rail Sector,"Freight rail is more energy-efficient than truck transport over long-haul distances, offering a low-energy and emissions-intensive option for transporting freight. This study evaluates techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment of seven alternative unblended fuels for freight locomotive engines─biodiesel, renewable diesel (RD), bio-oils, methanol, dimethyl ether (DME), ethanol, and ammonia─across 16 fuel pathways utilizing soybean, corn, woody biomass, renewable hydrogen, and waste sources, e.g., sludge, manure, and industrial CO2, and compares these to conventional diesel. The minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) ranged from $2.05 to $8.27 per diesel gallon equivalent (2020 US dollars), with biocrude and RDs produced from hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of sludge having the lowest MFSPs due to coproduct credits and avoided waste treatment cost. Life cycle GHG emissions ranged from −41 to 53 g of CO2e/MJ. RD from waste via HTL achieves negative emissions by diverting sludge/manure from GHG-intensive conventional management. Few pathways such as biocrude, methanol, and DME require additional control for SOX emissions in the refinery, while ethanol, FT-diesel, and bio-oil require additional control for particulate matter emissions. Bio-oil and RD from sludge have lower marginal abatement cost or MAC (–$38/tonne CO2 lowest) while methanol and ammonia with renewable hydrogen have higher MAC ($490/tonne CO2 maximum)."

In this study, we investigated the toxicokinetics of Tl in the intertidal snail Reishia clavigera, an ecologically and economically important gastropod native to East and Southeast Asia. Using the stable isotope 203Tl as a tracer, we quantified Tl uptake and elimination under environmentally relevant conditions across salinity (15–30‰) and temperature (7–28 °C) gradients. Despite moderate uptake rates (ku: 0.064–0.29 L g–1 day–1), Tl bioaccumulation remained low due to exceptionally fast elimination (ke: 0.79–3.37 day–1), with biological half-lives as short as 0.21 days. Salinity suppressed Tl uptake without affecting elimination, while temperature increased both ku and ke. The resulting bioconcentration factors (BCF: 59–160 L kg–1 dry weight) were two to four orders of magnitude lower than those of other trace metals, indicating inherently weak Tl retention. Tissue-specific analyses showed a higher Tl retention in viscera than in muscle, largely driven by slower elimination. Our findings resolve the apparent paradox between Tl’s high mammalian toxicity and relatively lower aquatic toxicity, highlighting rapid elimination as the key controlling factor. This work underscores the importance of integrating toxicokinetics into ecological risk assessment and suggests that Tl tissue levels in marine mollusks primarily reflect short-term environmental exposure rather than chronic contamination."

Herein, a polypyrrole (PPy) nanostructured coating strategy was proposed to modify PCs (PPy@P-BC) for rapid and efficient removal of ultrashort- and short-chain PFAS from water. Static batch tests revealed that the sorption rate constant and sorption capacity of PFAS (C2–C6) on PPy@P-BC are at least 38 times and 5 times greater than those on undecorated PCs and benchmark materials of granular activated carbon, respectively, and their sorption equilibrium time is within 300 s. The outstanding sorption performance of PPy@P-BC is maintained in dynamic column tests (>3120 bed volumes) and different types of real water contaminated by 36 PFAS, including 11 previously identified emerging PFAS (removal >95.3%). PPy@P-BC also exhibited excellent regeneration and reusability. The following dual-drive mechanisms for PFAS removal were identified based on experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations: (i) electrostatic attraction between amino functional groups (especially −NH•+−) on the nanostructured PPy coating and anionic PFAS and (ii) pore filling facilitated by the well-preserved porous structure via construction of the nanostructured coating. Overall, these results provide a promising solution to address the ultrashort- and short-chain PFAS crisis."

In this study, 59 reusable feminine hygiene products across five product categories first underwent total fluorine screening via particle-induced gamma-ray emission spectroscopy. Period underwear and reusable pads had the greatest rates of intentional PFAS use (>110 ppm total fluorine) at 33% and 25%, respectively. Subsequently, 19 of these products were chosen for targeted analysis of 31 ionic and 11 neutral PFAS. PFAS were detected in 100% of the extracted products, with 6:2 and 8:2 fluorotelomer alcohols being the most abundant compounds. Tested products were sourced from multiple markets, including North America, South America and Europe, all of which had at least one item with levels consistent with intentional fluorination. The observation of at least one product in each tested category not containing intentional fluorine indicates that PFAS use is unnecessary in all these reusable products. The results of this small initial survey, together with limited knowledge of the dermal absorption of PFAS, suggest more comprehensive PFAS exposure studies are needed."

Ensemble members with strongest MJO precipitation change in a given 20‐year period have a more El Niño‐like east Pacific warming pattern. MJO amplitude increases for east Pacific warming because of a strengthened meridional moisture gradient that supports MJO eastward propagation. A stronger vertical moisture gradient also exists for ensemble members with preferential east Pacific warming, which supports a stronger MJO under moisture mode theory."

However, photolysis‐driven postdepositional processing can alter ice core nitrate signals and complicate their interpretation. We present a new nitrogen isotope (δ15N) record of nitrate measured in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide ice core covering the last glacial period and Holocene. The glacial δ15N(NO3−) is substantially higher than the Holocene δ15N(NO3−), with a glacial‐interglacial difference of (26.6 ± 5.7) ‰. All samples exhibit a strong negative correlation between δ15N(NO3−) and the snow accumulation rate, suggesting that postdepositional processing is the primary driver of the δ15N(NO3−) variability. Photochemical model calculations indicate that changes in the degree of postdepositional processing can fully explain the observed glacial‐interglacial δ15N(NO3−) difference, with 12.7% and 31.8% of nitrate mass loss during the Holocene and glacial climate, respectively. Comparison with the Greenland GISP2 δ15N(NO3−) record indicates that the glacial level of postdepositional modification was higher at WAIS Divide despite its snow accumulation rate was twice that at Summit, Greenland. This is due to the higher light‐absorbing impurity contents in the GISP2 ice core that reduced postdepositional losses. We also assess the ability of using δ15N(NO3−) for past surface mass balance (SMB) reconstruction at WAIS Divide. We find this proxy is reliable for regions/periods with snow accumulation rates lower than 150 kg m−2 a−1. While exceeding this threshold, the assumption of a constant δ15N of initially deposited nitrate is no longer valid, leading to significant bias in SMB reconstruction such as WAIS Divide."

Here, we use an isotope‐enabled climate model with water‐tagging capability to show that the developing and decaying phases of ENSO are associated with distinct patterns of interannual δ18Op variability in the northern and southern TP. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we conducted modeling experiments to investigate three potential processes through which ENSO may affect the interannual variation of δ18Op in the TP, including (a) the initial vapor isotopic signal in the ocean sources, (b) the relative moisture contribution from different sources, and (c) atmospheric processes along the moisture transport path. We find that δ18Op is dominantly influenced by upstream processes along the moisture transport, in response to ENSO‐driven changes in atmospheric activities. Specifically, during the summer and fall of the developing El Niño (La Niña) phases, δ18Op in the southern TP is affected by convective activities in the Indian Peninsula, Bay of Bengal, Indochina Peninsula, and South China Sea, leading to enrichment (depletion) in δ18Op. In contrast, atmospheric activities over the Eurasian landmass and the local TP during the mature winter and the decaying spring phases of El Niño (La Niña) result in depletion (enrichment) of δ18Op in the northern TP. Our study suggests the possibility of improving the reconstruction of past ENSO‐related interannual variations at a seasonal scale by integrating isotopic proxies from TP."

However, it is not yet fully understood how different permafrost types constrain TWS changes during the rapid warming period. In this study, we focused on the six major Arctic river basins (Ob', Yenisei, Lena, Kolyma, Yukon, and Mackenzie), which are characterized by widespread permafrost, and employed three TWS products derived from remote sensing observations, land surface models, and reanalysis data sets to quantify changes in TWS anomalies during the rapid warming period (1981–2020). Statistical analyses revealed differential TWS declines across all permafrost types, with the most significant decline observed in the discontinuous permafrost regions at −3.05 mm/year, compared to in the continuous permafrost regions (−0.78 mm/year) and in the sporadic permafrost regions (−2.45 mm/year). Correlation analyses further indicated a pronounced negative relationship between permafrost active layer thickness (ALT) and TWS, especially in discontinuous permafrost regions, where a 1‐cm increase in ALT corresponded to a TWS decrease of up to 4.4‐mm. These findings highlight the significant impact of permafrost thawing accelerated by climate warming on TWS changes in permafrost‐dominated Arctic regions, with important implications for regional hydrology, carbon feedback, and ecosystem stability in the pan‐Arctic. Our results underscore the necessity of incorporating permafrost‐specific processes into hydrological models and climate assessments, thereby enhancing projections of water resource a4vailability and environmental changes in northern high‐latitude regions."

This study employed environmental covariates representing climate, soil, and vegetation, combined with a hybrid convolutional neural network ‐ Long Short‐term Memory‐self‐attention (CNN‐LSTM‐SA) model to predict net primary productivity (NPP) of the Northeast China (NEC) and the Mississippi River Basin (MRB) Mollisol regions. The analysis covered the periods from 2001 to 2020, and 2021 to 2040 under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs): SSP245 and SSP585. Subsequently, areas requiring crop type adjustments were identified, and appropriate crops were assigned to each growth site. Our results elucidate that: (a) During 2021–2040, a general increase in temperature and minor fluctuations in precipitation were observed across the study area. In the NEC, crop NPP initially increases before decreasing, whereas in the MRB, it consistently decreases. (b) Both vegetation and soil covariates explained 75.6% of NPP variability in the NEC, while in the MRB, climate factors, particularly precipitation, accounted for 18.4% of the variability. (c) The proportion of area requiring adjustment in the NEC ranged from 4.45% to 5.13% (SSP245) to 5.05%–5.77% (SSP585), while in the MRB, it varied from 4.92% to 7.54% (SSP245) to 6.49%–9.10% (SSP585), suggesting a necessity for more substantial cropping type adjustments under the SSP585 climate scenario. (d) In the NEC, the area cultivated with corn, soybean, and other crops will decrease, while rice cultivation will increase. Conversely, a decrease in wheat and pasture, and an increase in corn and soybean cultivation are suggested in the MRB. (e) Following crop type adjustments, the average NPP enhancements for corn, soybean, rice, and other crops in unsuitable areas of the NEC were 22.85%, 22.2%, 17.35%, and 20.5%, respectively, In the MRB, the average NPP enhancements for corn, soybean, wheat, and pasture were 28.5%, 26.9%, 32.4%, and 21.1%, respectively.

 Along-trench variations in various properties of subducted slabs have been inferred in subduction zones globally, yet the causes of these variations remain poorly understood. Along the Alaska Peninsula, the variation of slab (de)hydration and fluids shallower than 50-km depth cannot explain a seismicity gap below 150 km nor the abrupt changes in volcano density and arc orientation around Aniakchak volcano. Here we investigate the cause of these observations using seismic full-wave ambient noise tomography. Our 3D shear-wave velocity model reveals multiple high-velocity slab segments below about 50 km, with a much-lower-velocity segment broadly below Aniakchak. This low-velocity segment coincides with the inferred location of a subducted oceanic plate joint, where two sets of plate fabrics intersect, and with slab-normal fast directions in the asthenosphere indicated by seismic anisotropy. We infer that the subducted oceanic joint facilitated slab weakening and tearing, which has developed into a slab window below about 150 km, explaining the seismicity gap and slab-orthogonal mantle flow. Hence we suggest that oceanic plate joints may have an important role as potential weak zones in slabs and thus potentially influence subduction dynamics and seismicity.

 The heterodifunctionalization of alkenes is an efficient and straightforward method for the preparation of highly functionalized molecules. However, enantioselective introduction of two different carbon-based functional groups in a single step using readily accessible and inexpensive starting materials presents a significant challenge. Herein, we report an electrochemical copper-catalyzed protocol for the asymmetric cyanoesterification of vinylarenes using commercially available alkyl carbazates and trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) as the sources of ester and cyano groups, respectively. The desired products could be obtained with good yields and enantioselectivities under mild conditions without the need for stoichiometric oxidants, providing sustainable access to versatile synthetic intermediates that could be smoothly converted into a variety of useful chiral building blocks. Mechanistic data are consistent with electrochemical copper-catalyzed generation of alkoxycarbonyl radicals from alkyl carbazates and the copper catalyst is also responsible for the stereoselective C–CN bond formation. The potential synthetic utility of this new electrocatalytic protocol is demonstrated in the concise synthesis of pharmacologically active molecules.

Here, authors show that DSS1 is upregulated in metastatic ccRCC, promoting tumor growth and metastasis by impairing autophagy and stabilizing TWIST1. 
 The mechanisms underlying clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) metastasis remain largely unexplored. We demonstrate that Deleted in Split hand/Split foot protein 1 (DSS1), a critical cofactor of BRCA2 in DNA repair, is upregulated in metastatic ccRCC and promotes both tumor growth and distant metastasis. Mechanistically, DSS1 interacts with LC3 and promotes its degradation via TRIM25-mediated Lys63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitination at LC3B-K51. This impairs (macro) autophagic flux and leads to p62 accumulation, thereby stabilizing TWIST1 and facilitating its nuclear translocation, ultimately activating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). DSS1 highly expressed (DSS1hi) tumor cells are enriched in late-stage tumors and are associated with microvascular invasion within a vascularized invasive niche at the tumor-stromal interface, mediated by SPP1-ITGB1 interactions. Clinically, DSS1hi tumor cells correlate with therapeutic resistance and poorer patient outcomes. Collectively, these findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of ccRCC metastasis and suggest potential avenues for therapeutic intervention.

 Cellular decision-making and tissue homeostasis are governed by transcriptional networks shaped by chromatin accessibility. Using single-nucleus multi-omics, we jointly profile gene expression and chromatin accessibility in 10,335 cells from the Drosophila testis apical tip. This enables inference of 147 cell type-specific enhancer-gene regulons using SCENIC + . We functionally validate key transcription factors, including ovo and klumpfuss, known from other stem cell systems but not previously linked to spermatogenesis. CRISPR-mediated knockout reveals their essential roles in germline stem cell regulation, and we provide evidence that they co-regulate shared targets through overlapping enhancer elements. We further uncover a critical role for canonical Wnt signaling, with Pangolin/Tcf activating lineage-specific targets in the germline, soma, and niche. The Pan eRegulon links Wnt activity to cell adhesion, intercellular signaling and germline stem cell maintenance. Together, our study defines the enhancer-driven regulatory landscape of early spermatogenesis and reveals conserved, combinatorial mechanisms of niche-dependent stem cell control.

 Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) are key therapeutic agents in cancer immunotherapy and exert their effects through Fc receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms. However, the nanoscale receptor reorganization resulting from mAb binding and its implications for the therapeutic mode of action remain poorly understood. Here, we present a multi-target 3D RESI super-resolution microscopy technique that directly visualizes the structural organization of CD20 receptors and the Type I (e.g., Rituximab) and Type II (e.g., Obinutuzumab) anti-CD20 therapeutic antibodies and quantitatively analyze these interactions at single-protein resolution in situ. We discover that, while Type I mAbs promote higher-order CD20 oligomerization, Type II mAbs induce limited clustering, leading to differences in therapeutic function. Correlating RESI with functional studies for Type II antibodies with different hinge region flexibilities, we show that the oligomeric CD20 arrangement determines the Type I or Type II function. Thus, the nanoscale characterization of CD20-mAb complexes enhances our understanding of the structure-function relationships of therapeutic antibodies and offers insights into the design of next-generation mAb therapies. The nanoscale organization of the antigen-antibody complexes influences the therapeutic action of monoclonal antibodies.

Their responsiveness to approved antivirals and candidate vaccines lowers human risk, but ongoing surveillance is critically needed. 
 In March 2024, clade 2.3.4.4b highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses were first detected in U.S. dairy cattle. Similar viruses have since caused 70 zoonotic human infections. To assess changes to zoonotic potential, we characterized A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b viruses isolated from cows’ milk and birds. Bovine-derived viruses are lethal in mice and ferrets and transmit to direct but not airborne contact ferrets. All viruses replicate in human bronchial epithelial cells despite preferentially binding avian virus-like receptors. The bovine-derived viruses remain susceptible to FDA-approved antivirals, and they are inhibited by sera from ferrets vaccinated with WHO-recommended candidate vaccine viruses (CVV) or human sera from clade 2.3.4.4c vaccinees. While 2.3.4.4b viruses induce severe disease in mammalian models, they retain many avian virus-like characteristics. Combined, we conclude that the risk of contemporary bovine-derived viruses to humans not in contact with affected animals is low. However, heightened vigilance remains essential to promptly detect and respond to any changes.

 The functional programs adopted by cancer cells and their impact on the tumor microenvironment are complex and remain unclear. Here, we identify three distinct single-cell archetypes (i.e. metabolism, stemness and inflammation) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, each exhibiting unique spatial distribution. Further analysis shows an immune-suppressive niche populated by metabolism archetype cancer cells and TREM2-positive tumor-associated macrophages (TREM2+ TAMs), which exacerbates immune exclusion and compromises patient outcomes. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the upregulated squalene epoxidase (SQLE) expression in metabolism archetype cancer cells facilitates the generation of oxidized LDL (oxLDL). OxLDL induces TREM2+ TAM polarization through the TREM2-SYK-CEBPα axis, enabling these TAMs to promote cancer cell invasion, resistance to effector cytokines and CD8+ T cell dysfunction. Importantly, cancer cell-intrinsic SQLE and TREM2+ TAMs are associated with inferior immunotherapy response in human and mouse HCC. Our results highlight an oxLDL-mediated metabolic interplay between cancer cells and TREM2+ TAMs, offering a promising therapeutic avenue for HCC immunotherapies.

 Association with reactive metal (hydr)oxides is critical for soil organic carbon (SOC) stabilization. However, direct evidence is lacking on how shifting dominance of different metal-bound organic carbon within soil profile mediates SOC stability. Here we leverage a natural experiment comprising 16 soil profiles (~200 cm) sampled along a 1,500 km climatic gradient from semi-humid to semi-arid. We indicate that the response of SOC chemical stability (acid hydrolysis for recalcitrant organic carbon determination) to metal-bound organic carbon is asymmetric, meaning that metal-bound organic carbon dominating recalcitrant organic carbon does not strictly follow the pattern of greater content equating to stronger effect. Soil pH mediates the shift in dominance from iron to calcium phases over the range of 7.2 to 7.6, thereby regulating their respective impact on recalcitrant organic carbon. Our findings elucidate the key behavior of metal-bound organic carbon (especially calcium-bound organic carbon), in maintaining SOC stability under soil pH regulation. Metal-bound organic carbon dominating soil organic carbon stability does not follow the pattern of greater content equating to stronger effect, rather it is strongly regulated by soil pH, according to an experiment with 16 soil profiles spanning 1500 km in northern China."

 Over 130 million people in Latin America identify as Afro-descendants, many of whom inhabit lands with potential to mitigate biodiversity loss and climate change. Yet, the role of Afro-descendants is not adequately considered in conservation and climate decision-making. Here, we mapped the biological value of Afro-descendant lands in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Suriname, and conducted a matching analysis to estimate the effect of these lands on deforestation. Afro-descendant lands coincide with areas that have high biodiversity and irrecoverable carbon and were associated with a 29%–55% reduction in forest loss compared to control sites. To contextualize these findings, we present a social-historical assessment of Afro-descendant conservation practices. This assessment highlights the adaptation of African knowledge to the American tropics and the development of sustainable environmental practices. Global environmental institutions, multilateral agencies, and governments should include Afro-descendants in environmental decision-making and support research and policies that enable Afro-descendant management practices.

 Escalating impacts of snow droughts have critically threatened hydrological stability and socioeconomic resilience on the Tibetan Plateau, Asia’s alpine water tower. However, the mechanisms linking snow droughts to compound climate extremes remain poorly understood. Here, we presented comprehensive assessment of how snow drought regimes modulated compound climate extremes during the period 1979–2022. We found significant increases in severity for both dry snow droughts and warm snow droughts, with warm types emerging as a dominant driver of snowpack depletion. Dry/warm snow droughts triggered compound dry-hot/pluvial-hot extremes through divergent heat-moisture regulation pathways: surface energy budget imbalances acted as the common trigger, while moisture heterogeneity governed the dry-wet divergence. After snow disappearance, a significant coincidence rate of 0.68 (0.58) for compound dry-hot extremes (compound pluvial-hot extremes) was observed at a 1-month lag time (p < 0.05). These findings necessitate adaptive strategies to mitigate cascading threats to water-ecosystem-socioeconomic systems in the Asian water tower.

 The 2021 Fagradalsfjall eruption on Iceland’s Reykjanes Peninsula was preceded by an intense seismic swarm, offering an opportunity to investigate fluid dynamics and faulting processes at divergent plate boundary. Here we analysed 1306 full moment tensors of pre-eruption dike-related earthquakes and identified three faulting regimes: strike-slip, normal and reverse, driven by variations in vertical stress and controlled by fluid dynamics and crustal heterogeneity. Systematic volumetric components of these earthquakes revealed both tensile opening and compressive closing of cracks. Notably, crack closing dominated shallow, fractured crust, associated with surface subsidence above the dike, while crack opening occurred within the impermeable crust, suggesting overpressured fluids trapped at structural barriers. These variations highlight the role of fluid-rock interactions and anisotropic permeability in driving fault behaviour. Our results demonstrate that non-double-couple components of earthquakes are sensitive indicators of evolving stress and fluid migration. They provide insights into the mechanics of seismo-volcanic unrest at the slow-spreading rift.

 The inflow of warm waters into the Nordic Seas, crucial for sustaining the climate-regulating Atlantic overturning circulation, can be reconstructed from hydrography using a north-south dynamic height gradient across the Greenland-Scotland Ridge. Variations in this influx are herein linked to northward-propagating thermohaline anomalies, initially observed at the intergyre boundary and likely driven by changes in ocean heat transport. As these anomalies reach the eastern subpolar North Atlantic, they modulate the cross-ridge dynamic height difference, thereby influencing both the Atlantic inflow and the Nordic Seas overflows on multi-year to decadal scales. Thus, these thermohaline anomalies play a dynamically active role in modulating the watermass exchanges across the ridge and downstream along the Atlantic Water path, rather than being a simple passive train of signals. This explains why these thermohaline signals are a key source of climate predictability and provides fresh insights into the functioning of the Nordic Seas overturning circulation from observations.

 Surface soil moisture (SSM) is a critical state variable for water cycle research, and the advances in satellite remote sensing technology have provided a novel means for acquiring large-scale SSM data. While satellite microwave remote sensing-based SSM retrieval has emerged as the dominant approach for global SSM product development, offering numerous advantages, it still faces significant challenges. These include the trade-off between model accuracy and generalizability, the limitations of applying uniform retrieval models across diverse environments, and the inherent complexity and computational demands of the retrieval process. To address these common issues in microwave remote sensing-based SSM retrieval studies, this study proposed a cloud-based intelligent retrieval framework for global high-accuracy SSM estimation. This framework integrated physical mechanisms with machine learning models to ensure robust generalization and high retrieval accuracy; additionally, a model selection module was incorporated to enhance the overall retrieval accuracy by providing environment-specific retrieval models. In an assessment based on global validation sites for 1-km resolution SSM retrieval, the proposed framework performed well, with an R value of 0.851 and an ubRMSE of 0.058 m3·m−3. Furthermore, to mitigate the computational resource demands and time-consuming of the retrieval process, the SSM retrieval framework was implemented in a cloud environment utilizing Google Earth Engine, Drive, and Colab, thereby enabling seamless online operation of the entire retrieval process. This cloud-based intelligent retrieval framework facilitates real-time point-scale SSM retrieval on a global scale and rapid production of high-accuracy SSM products at the regional scale (SSM products for China at 1 km resolution can be accessed via https://tinyurl.com/SSMproduct).

 Forest ecosystems underpin global ecological security, yet China’s forest landscapes are subjected to dual pressures of restoration and degradation, with complex spatiotemporal dynamics that remain insufficiently understood. While existing studies focus on static landscape metrics, the nonlinear interactions between natural and anthropogenic drivers of forest fragmentation and connectivity remain elusive. This study addresses this gap by introducing the Ecological Land Evolution Index (ELEI) to quantify patch-scale forest dynamics, integrating multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) with XGBoost-SHAP analysis to dissect driving mechanisms across China from 2000 to 2020. Key findings reveal distinct spatial patterns: Ecological Land Restoration (ELR) processes with high connectivity potential concentrated in northeastern China, the Qinba Mountains, and southwestern regions. “Connection-type” patches (comprising 48 % of ELR area) dominated low-elevation plains (e.g., Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau), while “infilling-type” restoration prevailed in hilly/mountainous areas, driven by shrubland-to-forest conversions. Ecological Land Degradation (ELD) driven by cropland expansion caused severe fragmentation in the Sichuan Basin and Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau.”Enclosing-type” ELD dominated high-relief mountains, while “fragmentation-type” patches thrived in lowlands under agricultural/urban pressures. MGWR analysis identified slope, elevation, and the Grain for Green Program as key positive drivers of ELR connectivity, while urbanization and agricultural expansion emerged as dominant ELD fragmentation forces with pronounced spatial heterogeneity. XGBoost-SHAP further revealed nonlinear interactions: road density (>0.5 km/km2) exacerbating fragmentation in depopulating peri-urban zones, and climate-topography thresholds shaping restoration efficacy (e.g., precipitation > 1,300 mm). This national-scale assessment highlights the need for connectivity-oriented strategies: prioritize contiguous forest expansion in plains, promote infilling-type restoration in hills/mountains, and facilitate passive recovery in high-altitude regions. By quantifying patch-scale connectivity changes and disentangling complex driver interactions, the study provides a scientific foundation for adaptive forest management, bridging ecological conservation and socioeconomic development."

Across a large team of experts we have now identified all glaciers that end in lakes. Only about 1% do so, but they are generally larger than those which end on land. This is important to understand, as lakes can influence the behaviour of glacier ice, including how fast it disappears. This new dataset allows us to better model glaciers at a global scale, accounting for the effect of lakes. 
 Proglacial lakes at glacier termini have received widespread attention in the literature for their role in accelerating melt, velocity and contributing to cryospheric hazards. Although global and regional inventories for both glaciers and lakes exist, lake-terminating glaciers have not been consistently identified at the global scale. Based on the most recent global glacier inventory (RGI7), which so far only identifies some marine termini but none for lakes, we present a global inventory of lake-terminating glaciers, differentiating between three classes. The dataset corresponds to the year 2000 (± 1.5), matching to the timestamp of RGI7 outlines (2001, ± 6.2). We find that of 274,531 glaciers worldwide, 1.4 % terminate in lakes, varying between 0.5 and 6.7 % across 19 RGI regions. These glaciers account for 11.4 % of the total glacier area (0.2 to 41.8 % across regions).

FINAM is designed to simplify the integration of various models with minimal effort, as demonstrated through various examples ranging from simple to complex systems. 
 In this study, we present a new coupling framework named FINAM (short for “FINAM is not a model”). FINAM is designed to facilitate the coupling of models that were developed as standalone tools in the first place and to enable seamless model extensions by wrapping existing models into components with well-specified interfaces. Although established coupling solutions such as Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF), Ocean Atmosphere Sea Ice Soil (OASIS), or Yet Another Coupler (YAC) focus on highly parallel workflows, complex data processing, and regridding, FINAM prioritizes usability and flexibility, allowing users to focus on scientific exploration of coupling scenarios rather than technical complexities. FINAM emphasizes ease of use for end users to create, run, and modify model couplings, as well as for model developers to create and maintain components for their models. The framework is particularly suited for applications where rapid prototyping and flexible model extensions are desired. It is primarily targeting environmental models, including ecological models for animal populations, individual-based forest models, field-scale crop models, economical models, and hydrological models. Python's robust interoperability features further enhance FINAM's capabilities, allowing us to wrap and use models written in various programming languages like Fortran, C, C++, Rust, and others. This paper describes the main principles and modules of FINAM and presents example workflows to demonstrate its features.

The machine interface described in this paper will be an efficient way to meet the overwhelming data needs. 
 Technologies such as machine learning and deep learning are powering the discovery of meaningful patterns in Earth science big data. In the field of mineralogy, Mindat (“mindat.org”) is one of the largest databases. Although its front-end website is open and free, a machine interface for bulk data query and download had never been set up before 2022. Through a project called OpenMindat, an application programming interface (API) to enable open data query and access from Mindat was set up in 2023. To further lower the barrier between Mindat open data and geoscientists with limited coding skills, we developed an R package (OpenMindat v1.0.0) on top of the API. The Mindat API includes multiple data subjects such as geomaterials (e.g., rocks, minerals, synonyms, variety, mixture, and commodity), localities, and the IMA-approved (International Mineralogical Association) mineral list. The OpenMindat v1.0.0 package wraps the capabilities of the Mindat API and is designed to be user-friendly and extensible. In addition to providing functions for querying data subjects on the API, the package supports exporting data to various formats. In real-world applications, these functions only require minor coding for users to get desired datasets, and various other packages in the R environment can be used to analyze and visualize the data. The OpenMindat v1.0.0 package, which includes detailed tutorials and examples, is available on GitHub under the MIT license. The field of mineralogy and many other geoscience disciplines are facing opportunities enabled by open data. Various research topics such as mineral network analysis, mineral association rule mining, mineral ecology, mineral evolution, and critical minerals have already benefited from Mindat's open data efforts in recent years.

 The study presents a novel approach for fault detection on subsurface geological homoclinal interfaces (slopes) using a supervised learning algorithm and careful input variable (feature) selection. Synthetic faulted slopes are generated using Delaunay triangulation via the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL), allowing for adjustments of parameters. We introduce 24 features, including local geometric features and neighborhood analysis, for classification. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed as the classification algorithm, achieving high precision and recall rates for fault-related observations. Application to real borehole data (elevations of buried stratigraphic contacts) demonstrates the effectiveness of the method in detecting fault orientations; the challenges remain with respect to distinguishing faults with opposite dip directions. The study highlights the need to address 3D fault zone complexities and their identification. Despite limitations, the proposed supervised approach offers significant advancement over clustering-based methods, showing promise in detecting faults of various orientations.

The production of relevant microplastic models has the potential to allow for more quantitative experimental studies on the toxicity, fate, and behavior of these anthropogenic particles. The accelerated weathering method generated MPs in the hundreds of milligrams to grams scales, with controllable and tunable degree of oxidation (measured as carbonyl indices from 0.06 to 1.84), particle size (between 15.8 and 365.4 μm), and surface features. We found these properties to be comparable with MPs found in the ocean, making this report a unique example of scalable and tunable model MP synthesis."

In this study, we established a mouse model through a 28-day oral administration of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) at doses of 3 and 15 mg/kg BW/day to investigate its impacts on pathological retinal angiogenesis, a hallmark of multiple vision-threatening diseases. PFOA exposure induced characteristic retinal acellular capillary formation, even in the normal avascular zone, accompanied by a hemorrhagic manifestation. Through integrated methodologies combining in vivo reactive oxygen species (ROS) quantification, retinal proteomics, and microglial phenotypic analysis, we demonstrated that PFOA compromises blood–retinal barrier integrity, resulting in ROS accumulation. This triggered a cascade involving nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation, microglial proinflammatory response, proinflammatory cytokine release, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) overexpression, and subsequent vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) hypersecretion. Complementary in vitro experiments further confirmed that PFOA treatment induced microglial activation by prompting NF-κB nuclear translocation, with activated microglia secreting VEGFA, which targets retinal microvascular endothelial cells to promote tube formation. Our work provides the first mechanistic insights into PFOA-induced retinal angiogenesis and highlights its potential role in visual impairment."

This study was designed to elucidate the effects of GLY on male reproductive health by in vivo and in vitro studies. Data showed that chronic environmental levels of GLY reduced sperm quality and spermatogenic cell number in mice. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed that GLY downregulated key glycolytic rate-limiting enzymes HK2 and PFK1, and decreased lactate abundance, while a strong positive correlation between sperm quality and lactate level was established. Further assays showed that GLY inhibited the expression of four glycolytic key proteins and disrupted the HK2 mitochondrial localization. Molecular docking and immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that HK2 binds to VDAC1 on the mitochondrial outer membrane, which was inhibited by GLY. This inhibition was significantly alleviated by VBIT-4, an inhibitor of VDAC1 oligomerization. Notably, oxidative stress-mediated VDAC1 oligomerization due to excessive mitochondrial fission was identified as a key mechanism by which GLY inhibits glycolysis in Sertoli cells. In summary, this study uncovers a novel metabolic regulatory mechanism by which GLY impairs spermatogenesis via the VDAC1-HK2-glycolysis axis, providing critical insights for preventing GLY-induced reproductive toxicity and related environmental risks."

Multiple past studies reveal broad variation of stream water MeHg and total Hg (THg) concentration responses to forest harvesting, which has confounded messaging to forest and resource managers. To advance beyond divergent and sometimes contradictory findings, we synthesized information for 23 previously studied catchments in North America and Fennoscandia and compiled a uniform set of soil, landscape, and harvesting properties to identify forest management, riparian, and hillslope factors that influence responses of stream water MeHg and THg concentrations. From this synthesis, we found catchments with high soil moisture and organic soil layers >100 cm to be at highest risk for disturbance-induced increases in MeHg formation after harvest but not necessarily affecting concentrations of MeHg in stream waters. Instead, the combination of MeHg formation in soils along with factors that affect mobilization with runoff to streams most influenced how forest harvest affects MeHg concentrations in stream waters."

Using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry and high-throughput sequencing, we investigated DOM and microbiota across weakly acidic silty loam topsoil (0–20 cm) and subsoil (80–100 cm) along eroding–depositional gradients in a maize-cropped Mollisol agroecosystem. The overall chemodiversity, composition, and complexity of the DOM molecule pool were higher in topsoil than subsoil, but their topographical differences were predominantly observed in the subsoil, indicating erosion-induced homogenization of surface molecular fingerprints. Depositional subsoil increased DOM molecular diversity and accumulated recalcitrant lignin/tannin compounds, contrasting lipid enrichment at the eroding subsoil. Thermodynamic analysis via substrate-explicit models confirmed reduced DOM bioavailability in depositional subsoil compared to its erosional counterpart. Across both soil layers, microbial α-diversity metrics declined at eroding sites but increased at depositional sites. Crucially, these metrics negatively correlated with the diversity and complexity of DOM molecules in the topsoil yet positively correlated in the subsoil. These divergent patterns reflect depth-dependent microbial strategies─surface microbes favored labile substrates, while subsurface specialists utilized complex compounds. Our findings highlight subsoil as a critical zone where erosion–deposition processes establish distinct DOM–microbe interfaces governing soil organic matter stabilization."

However, the influence of oxidative aging and the SOA oxidation state on the ROS yield has not been systematically investigated.

We studied the chlorine-initiated oxidation of limonene under indoor lighting (LED lights) and simulated outdoor lighting (a combination of UVA and LED lights) using an environmental chamber and a suite of instruments measuring gas and particle phase products. OH radicals formed and dominated the oxidation of limonene in the presence of NOx, Cl2, and LED lights, highlighting that Cl-initiated chemistry can generate OH chemistry in indoor environments, even in the absence of sunlight. Measurements from an iodide chemical ionization mass spectrometer showed gas phase reaction products from both Cl and OH addition to limonene, including nitrated species LIMANO3 (C10H17NO4) and LIMALNO3 (C10H17NO6). Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) yields were high, exceeding 1.1 in experiments with low NOx and high limonene concentrations, and showed strong dependence on temperature, NOx, and the VOC/Cl2 ratio.

By integrating patient data with demographic, environmental, and socio‐economic variables, the study assesses the complex factors influencing TB incidence and prevalence. The results indicate significant spatial clustering of TB cases, with the highest concentrations in areas characterized by high population density, lower socio‐economic status, limited healthcare accessibility, and poor environmental conditions. Temporal trends reveal a gradual decline in TB incidence over the study period; however, certain hotspots persist, underscoring the need for sustained and targeted interventions. Furthermore, the study identifies a correlation between TB prevalence and inadequate living conditions, emphasizing the role of socio‐economic improvement in disease control. These findings provide crucial insights for policymakers and public health officials, facilitating the development of more effective, evidence‐based TB control strategies tailored to the unique socio‐economic and geographical landscape of Şanlıurfa."

 The multi-layered nucleolus serves as the primary site of ribosome biogenesis1,2, where successive maturation of small (SSU)3,4 and large (LSU)5 ribosomal subunit precursors occur. However, the spatio-functional relationship between pre-rRNA processing and nucleolar substructures and how this adapts to changing cellular physiological demands have remained incompletely understood6,7. Here, our spatiotemporal analyses revealed a compartment-specific ribosomal subunit processing in human nucleoli, with SSU processomes maintained in fibrillar center/dense fibrillar component/periphery dense fibrillar component (FC/DFC/PDFC) domains while LSU pre-rRNAs largely transited to PDFC/granular component (GC) regions. Slow proliferating cells exhibited unexpected 5' external transcribed space (5' ETS)-centered SSU processing impairment, accompanied by FC/DFC structural remodeling and retarded SSU outflux. Direct 5' ETS processing perturbation at least partially recapitulated these FC/DFC alterations, supporting the functional interdependence between SSU processing and nucleolar architecture. Notably, anamniote bipartite nucleoli with merged FC/DFC compartments8,9 exhibited distinct 5' ETS distribution and slower pre-rRNA flux compared to multi-layered nucleoli in amniotes. Introducing a FC/DFC interface to bipartite nucleoli enhanced processing efficiency, indicating that evolutionary emergence of nested FC/DFC may have optimized pre-rRNA processing. Collectively, depicting the spatiotemporal distribution of pre-rRNAs revealed an essential role of 5' ETS-centered SSU processing in maintaining nucleolar substructures and suggested a possible evolutionary advantage of the multi-layered structure in amniotes."

 There is an urgent need for efficient and innovative therapies to treat brain disorders such as psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. Immunotherapies have proved to be efficient in many medical areas, but have not been considered to treat brain diseases due to the poor brain penetration of immunoglobulins1,2. Here we developed a bivalent biparatopic antibody, made of two camelid heavy-chain antibodies (called nanobodies)3, one binding to, and the other potentiating the activity of, homodimeric metabotropic glutamate receptor 2. We show that this bivalent nanobody, given peripherally, reaches the brain and corrects cognitive deficits in two preclinical mouse models with endophenotypes resulting from NMDA receptor hypofunction. Notably, these in vivo effects last for at least 7 days after a single intraperitoneal injection and are maintained after subchronic treatment. Our results establish a proof of concept that nanobodies can target brain receptors, and pave the way for nanobody-based therapeutic strategies for the treatment of brain disorders.

 Salicylic acid (SA) is the active ingredient in willow bark that has been used for anti-inflammation and pain relief for centuries. Aspirin, a derivative of SA, is the most widely used medication in human history. SA also acts as a key plant defence hormone1–4. Although SA was known to be produced from chorismate in the model plant Arabidopsis5,6, how it is biosynthesized in plant families outside Brassicaceae remains unclear. Here we report the identification of a conserved pathway for SA biosynthesis in seed plants. Using Nicotiana benthamiana as a model, we identified three key steps for the biosynthesis of SA. First, ligation of benzoyl coenzyme A (CoA) and benzyl alcohol by benzoyl-CoA:benzyl alcohol benzoyl transferase (BEBT) gives rise to benzyl benzoate, which is then hydroxylated by benzyl benzoate oxidase (BBO) to produce benzyl salicylate. Subsequent cleavage of benzyl salicylate by benzyl salicylate hydrolase (BSH) yields SA. Notably, genes encoding these three enzymes are present in a broad range of plants, and the genes from dicots such as willow, poplar and soybean as well as the monocot rice can complement the phenotype of SA-deficient mutants of N. benthamiana. Moreover, knockout analysis of the Oryza sativa OsBEBT, OsBBO and OsBSH genes reveals that they are required for SA biosynthesis in rice. Our findings suggest that the SA biosynthesis pathway is highly conserved in plants.

 Diverse sets of complete human genomes are required to construct a pangenome reference and to understand the extent of complex structural variation. Here we sequence 65 diverse human genomes and build 130 haplotype-resolved assemblies (median continuity of 130 Mb), closing 92% of all previous assembly gaps1,2 and reaching telomere-to-telomere status for 39% of the chromosomes. We highlight complete sequence continuity of complex loci, including the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), SMN1/SMN2, NBPF8 and AMY1/AMY2, and fully resolve 1,852 complex structural variants. In addition, we completely assemble and validate 1,246 human centromeres. We find up to 30-fold variation in α-satellite higher-order repeat array length and characterize the pattern of mobile element insertions into α-satellite higher-order repeat arrays. Although most centromeres predict a single site of kinetochore attachment, epigenetic analysis suggests the presence of two hypomethylated regions for 7% of centromeres. Combining our data with the draft pangenome reference1 significantly enhances genotyping accuracy from short-read data, enabling whole-genome inference3 to a median quality value of 45. Using this approach, 26,115 structural variants per individual are detected, substantially increasing the number of structural variants now amenable to downstream disease association studies.

 Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have a pivotal cancer-supportive role, yet CAF-targeted therapies are lacking1,2. Here, using spatial transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing, we investigate the role of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) in high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Mechanistically, NNMT-induced H3K27me3 hypomethylation drives complement secretion from CAFs, attracting immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to the tumour. Nnmt knockout in immunocompetent mice impairs tumour growth in syngeneic ovarian, breast and colon tumour models through enhanced CD8+ T cell activation. Using high-throughput screening, we develop a potent and specific NNMT inhibitor that reduces the tumour burden and metastasis in multiple mouse cancer models and restores immune checkpoint blockade efficacy by decreasing CAF-mediated recruitment of MDSCs and reinvigorating CD8+ T cell activation. Our findings establish NNMT as a central CAF regulator and a promising therapeutic target to mitigate immunosuppression in the tumour microenvironment.

 Although the role of cellular immunity in checkpoint immunotherapy (CPI) for cancer is well established1,2, the effect of antibody-mediated humoral immunity is comparably underexplored. Here we used rapid extracellular antigen profiling3 to map the autoantibody reactome within a cohort of 374 patients with cancer treated with CPIs and 131 healthy control participants for autoantibodies to 6,172 extracellular and secreted proteins (the ‘exoproteome’). Globally, patients with cancer treated with CPIs had diverse autoreactivities that were elevated relative to control individuals but changed minimally with treatment. Autoantibody signatures in patients treated with CPI strikingly distinguished them from healthy individuals. Although associations of specific autoantibodies with immune-related adverse events were sparse, we detected numerous individual autoantibodies that were associated with greatly altered odds ratios for response to therapy. These included autoantibodies to immunomodulatory proteins, such as cytokines, growth factors and immunoreceptors, as well as tumour surface proteins. Functional evaluation of several autoantibody responses indicated that they neutralized the activity of their target proteins, which included type I interferons (IFN-I), IL-6, OSM, TL1A, and BMPR1A and BMPR2. Modelling the effects of autoantibodies to IFN-I and TL1A in preclinical mouse tumour models resulted in enhanced CPI efficacy, consistent with their effects in patients. In conclusion, these findings indicate that autoantibodies to the exoproteome modify CPI responses and highlight therapeutically actionable pathways that can be exploited to augment immunotherapy.

 Genetic studies have identified thousands of individual disease-associated non-coding alleles, but the identification of the causal alleles and their functions remains a critical bottleneck1. CRISPR–Cas editing has enabled targeted modification of DNA to introduce and test disease alleles. However, the combination of inefficient editing, heterogeneous editing outcomes in individual cells and nonspecific transcriptional changes caused by editing and culturing conditions limits the ability to detect the functional consequences of disease alleles2,3. To overcome these challenges, we present a multi-omic single-cell sequencing approach that directly identifies genomic DNA edits, assays the transcriptome and measures cell-surface protein expression. We apply this approach to investigate the effects of gene disruption, deletions in regulatory regions, non-coding single-nucleotide polymorphism alleles and multiplexed editing. We identify the effects of individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms, including the state-specific effects of an IL2RA autoimmune variant in primary human T cells. Multimodal functional genomic single-cell assays, including DNA sequencing, enable the identification of causal variation in primary human cells and bridge a crucial gap in our understanding of complex human diseases.

 Complex integumentary appendages such as avian feathers and mammalian hair play a principal role in tetrapod evolution, with critical functions in insulation, sensation, display and flight. Although feathers and hair originated in the stem-lineages of birds and mammals, respectively1,2, their underlying gene regulatory network has much deeper amniote roots3. The early evolution of amniote integumentary appendages, however, remains poorly understood because of the absence of fossil evidence. Here we present Mirasaura grauvogeli, a small-sized diapsid from the Middle Triassic epoch (about 247 million years ago) with a distinctive crest formed by elongate integumentary appendages extending serially along its back, similar to those of the poorly understood Triassic reptile Longisquama4–7. Despite its superficially bird-like skull, Mirasaura is not closely related to avemetatarsalians but instead belongs to the exclusively Triassic reptilian clade Drepanosauromorpha8. Melanosomes preserved in its integumentary appendages are consistent in geometry with melanosomes of feathers but not those of reptilian skin or mammalian hair. Nevertheless, the morphology of the integumentary appendages and phylogenetic placement of Mirasaura indicate that they are not structurally homologous to feathers or other integumentary appendages in living amniotes. Our findings show that complex integumentary appendages are not restricted to avemetatarsalians and mammaliaforms among amniotes and evolved in a lineage basal to all extant reptiles, challenging our understanding of the evolution of the reptilian integument.

 The miniaturization of transistors is approaching its limits owing to challenges in heat management and information transfer speed1. To overcome these obstacles, emerging technologies such as spintronics2 are being developed, which make use of the electron’s spin as well as its charge. Local phenomena at interfaces or structural defects will greatly influence the efficiency of spin-based devices, making the ability to study spin-wave propagation at the nanoscale and atomic scale a key challenge3,4. The development of high-spatial-resolution tools to investigate spin waves, also called magnons, at relevant length scales is thus essential to understand how their properties are affected by local features. Here we detect bulk THz magnons at the nanoscale using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). By using high-resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy with hybrid-pixel electron detectors, we overcome the challenges posed by weak signals to map THz magnon excitations in a thin NiO nanocrystal. Advanced inelastic electron scattering simulations corroborate our findings. These results open new avenues for detecting magnons and exploring their dispersions and their modifications arising from nanoscale structural or chemical defects. This marks a milestone in magnonics and presents exciting opportunities for the development of spintronic devices.

 To coexist with its resident microorganisms, the host must have a sense to adjust its behaviour in response to them. In the intestine, a sense for nutrients transduced to the brain through neuroepithelial circuits guides appetitive choices1–5. However, a sense that allows the host to respond in real time to stimuli arising from resident gut microorganisms remains to be uncovered. Here we show that in the mouse colon, the ubiquitous microbial pattern flagellin—a unifying feature across phyla6—stimulates Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) in peptide YY (PYY)-labelled colonic neuropod cells. This stimulation leads to PYY release onto NPY2R vagal nodose neurons to regulate feeding. Mice lacking TLR5 in these cells eat more and gain more weight than controls. We found that flagellin does not act on the nerve directly. Instead, flagellin stimulates neuropod cells from the colonic lumen to reduce feeding through a gut–brain sensory neural circuit. Moreover, flagellin reduces feeding independent of immune responses, metabolic changes or the presence of gut microbiota. This sense enables the host to adjust its behaviour in response to a molecular pattern from its resident microorganisms. We call this sense at the interface of the biota and the brain the neurobiotic sense7.

In this Review, we provide an in-depth analysis of integrated uses of omics technologies, genome editing, protein design and high-throughput phenotyping, in crop improvement, supported by artificial intelligence-enabled tools. We discuss the emerging applications and current challenges of these technologies in crop improvement. Finally, we present a perspective on how elite alleles generated through these technologies can be incorporated into the genomes of existing and de novo domesticated crops, aided by a proposed artificial intelligence model. We suggest that integrating these technologies with agricultural practices will lead to a new revolution in crop improvement, contributing to global food security in a sustainable manner. The integration of omics technologies, genome editing and protein design with artificial intelligence (AI) promises rapid advances in the field of crop improvement that will improve global food security."

 Human history is born in writing. Inscriptions are among the earliest written forms, and offer direct insights into the thought, language and history of ancient civilizations. Historians capture these insights by identifying parallels—inscriptions with shared phrasing, function or cultural setting—to enable the contextualization of texts within broader historical frameworks, and perform key tasks such as restoration and geographical or chronological attribution1. However, current digital methods are restricted to literal matches and narrow historical scopes. Here we introduce Aeneas, a generative neural network for contextualizing ancient texts. Aeneas retrieves textual and contextual parallels, leverages visual inputs, handles arbitrary-length text restoration, and advances the state of the art in key tasks. To evaluate its impact, we conduct a large study with historians using outputs from Aeneas as research starting points. The historians find the parallels retrieved by Aeneas to be useful research starting points in 90% of cases, improving their confidence in key tasks by 44%. Restoration and geographical attribution tasks yielded superior results when historians were paired with Aeneas, outperforming both humans and artificial intelligence alone. For dating, Aeneas achieved a 13-year distance from ground-truth ranges. We demonstrate Aeneas’ contribution to historical workflows through analysis of key traits in the renowned Roman inscription Res Gestae Divi Augusti, showing how integrating science and humanities can create transformative tools to assist historians and advance our understanding of the past.

 Experiments that track hippocampal place cells in mice navigating the same real environment have found significant changes in neural representations over a period of days1,2. However, whether such ‘representational drift’ serves an intrinsic function, such as distinguishing similar experiences that occur at different times3,4, or is instead observed due to subtle differences in the sensory environment or behaviour5–7, remains unresolved. Here we used the experimental control offered by a multisensory virtual reality system to determine that differences in sensory environment or behaviour do not detectably change drift rate. We also found that the excitability of individual place cells was most predictive of their representational drift over subsequent days, with more excitable cells exhibiting less drift. These findings establish that representational drift occurs in mice even with highly reproducible environments and behaviour and highlight neuronal excitability as a key factor of long-term representational stability.

 Salicylic acid (SA) is a ubiquitous plant hormone with a long history in human civilization1,2. Because of the central role of SA in orchestrating plant pathogen defence, understanding SA biosynthesis is fundamental to plant immunity research and crop improvement. Isochorismate-derived SA biosynthesis has been well defined in Arabidopsis. However, increasing evidence suggests a crucial function for phenylalanine-derived SA biosynthesis in many other plant species1. Here we reveal the phenylalanine-derived SA biosynthetic pathway in rice by identifying three dedicated enzymes — peroxisomal benzoyl-CoA:benzyl alcohol benzoyltransferase (BEBT), the endoplasmic reticulum-associated cytochrome P450 enzyme benzylbenzoate hydroxylase (BBH), and cytosolic benzylsalicylate esterase (BSE) that sequentially convert benzoyl-CoA to benzylbenzoate, benzylsalicylate and SA. The pathogen-induced gene expression pattern and SA biosynthetic functions of this triple-enzyme module are conserved in diverse plants. This work fills a major knowledge gap in the biosynthesis of a key plant defence hormone, establishing a foundation for new strategies to create disease-resistant crops.

 Achieving long-term underwater adhesion to dynamic, regenerating soft substrates that undergo extreme fluctuations in pH and moisture remains a major unresolved challenge, with far-reaching implications for healthcare, manufacturing, robotics and marine applications1–16. Here, inspired by remoras—fish equipped with specialized adhesive discs—we developed the Mechanical Underwater Soft Adhesion System (MUSAS). Through detailed anatomical, behavioural, physical and biomimetic investigations of remora adhesion on soft substrates, we uncovered the key physical principles and evolutionary adaptations underlying their robust attachment. These insights guided the design of MUSAS, which shows extraordinary versatility, adhering securely to a wide range of soft substrates with varying roughness, stiffness and structural integrity. MUSAS achieves an adhesion-force-to-weight ratio of up to 1,391-fold and maintains performance under extreme pH and moisture conditions. We demonstrate its utility across highly translational models, including in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo settings, enabling applications such as ultraminiaturized aquatic kinetic temperature sensors, non-invasive gastroesophageal reflux monitoring, long-acting antiretroviral drug delivery and messenger RNA administration via the gastrointestinal tract.

 Coherent quantum transition spectroscopy is a powerful tool in metrology1, quantum information processing2, magnetometry3 and precision tests of the standard model4. It was applied with great success in proton and deuteron magnetic moment measurements5, which culminated in maser spectroscopy with sub-parts-per-trillion resolution6 and many other experiments at the forefront of physics7. All of these experiments were performed on macroscopic ensembles of particles, whereas the coherent spectroscopy of a ‘free’ single nuclear spin has, to our knowledge, never been reported before. Here we demonstrate coherent quantum transition spectroscopy of the spin of a single antiproton stored in a cryogenic Penning-trap system. We apply a multi-trap technique8, detect the antiproton spin state using the continuous Stern–Gerlach effect9 and transport the particle to the homogeneous magnetic field of a precision trap (PT). Here we induce the coherent dynamics and analyse the result by quantum-projection measurements in the analysis trap (AT)10. We observe, for the first time, Rabi oscillations of an antiproton spin and achieve in time-series measurements spin-inversion probabilities greater than 80% at spin coherence times of about 50 s. Scans of single-particle spin resonances show inversions greater than 70%, at transition linewidths 16 times narrower than in previous measurements8, limited by cyclotron frequency measurement decoherence. This achievement marks a notable step towards at least tenfold improved tests of matter/antimatter symmetry using proton and antiproton magnetic moments.

 Many animals use vision to navigate their environment. The pattern of changes that self-motion induces in the visual scene, referred to as optic flow1, is first estimated in local patches by directionally selective neurons2–4. However, how arrays of directionally selective neurons, each responsive to motion in a preferred direction at specific retinal positions, are organized to support robust decoding of optic flow by downstream circuits is unclear. Understanding this global organization requires mapping fine, local features of neurons across an animal’s field of view3. In Drosophila, the asymmetrical dendrites of the T4 and T5 directionally selective neurons establish their preferred direction, which makes it possible to predict directional tuning from anatomy4,5. Here we show that the organization of the compound eye shapes the systematic variation in the preferred directions of directionally selective neurons across the entire visual field. To estimate the preferred directions across the visual field, we reconstructed hundreds of T4 neurons in an electron-microscopy volume of the full adult fly brain6, and discovered unexpectedly stereotypical dendritic arborizations. We then used whole-head micro-computed-tomography scans to map the viewing directions of all compound eye facets, and found a non-uniform sampling of visual space that explains the spatial variation in preferred directions. Our findings show that the global organization of the directionally selective neurons’ preferred directions is determined mainly by the fly’s compound eye, revealing the intimate connections between eye structure, functional properties of neurons and locomotion control.

 Malaria remains a substantial global health challenge, causing approximately half a million deaths each year1. The mosquito fibrinogen-related protein 1 (FREP1) is required for malaria parasites to infect the midgut epithelium2. The naturally occurring FREP1Q allele has been reported to prevent parasite infection, while supporting essential physiological functions in the mosquito3. Here we generate congenic strains of Anopheles stephensi, edited to carry either the parasite-susceptible FREP1L224 or the putative-refractory FREP1Q224 alleles. The FREP1Q224 allele confers robust resistance to infection by both human and rodent malaria parasites, with negligible fitness costs. The protective FREP1Q224 allele can be efficiently driven into FREP1L224 mosquito populations using a novel linked allelic-drive system that selectively replaces the L224 codon with the parasite-refractory Q224 allele, thereby rendering populations refractory to parasite infection. This antimalaria drive system provides a novel genetic approach to aid in malaria elimination efforts.

 Our knowledge of biogeographic patterns and processes in the deep sea has been limited by the lack of integrated datasets that cover its vast extent1. Here we analyse a new global dataset of genomic DNA sequences, spanning an entire taxonomic class of benthic invertebrates (Ophiuroidea), to obtain a broad understanding of phylogenetic divergence and biotic movement across all oceans, from coastal margins down to the abyssal plains. We show that regional faunas on the continental shelf are phylogenetically divergent, particularly at temperate and tropical latitudes. By contrast, assemblages in the deep sea are much more connected. Many temperate deep-sea lineages have achieved distribution ranges across the planet, including over the Quaternary period. A close relationship exists between deep-sea faunas of the northern Atlantic and, on the opposite side of the globe, southern Australia. Bathymetric interchange is not only reliant on vertical migration through isothermal polar waters but also occurs across the thermal depth gradients of tropical regions. The connected nature of deep-sea life should be an important consideration in marine conservation assessments.

 Since the advent of computing, humans have sought computer input technologies that are expressive, intuitive and universal. While diverse modalities have been developed, including keyboards, mice and touchscreens, they require interaction with a device that can be limiting, especially in on-the-go scenarios. Gesture-based systems use cameras or inertial sensors to avoid an intermediary device, but tend to perform well only for unobscured movements. By contrast, brain–computer or neuromotor interfaces that directly interface with the body’s electrical signalling have been imagined to solve the interface problem1, but high-bandwidth communication has been demonstrated only using invasive interfaces with bespoke decoders designed for single individuals2–4. Here, we describe the development of a generic non-invasive neuromotor interface that enables computer input decoded from surface electromyography (sEMG). We developed a highly sensitive, easily donned sEMG wristband and a scalable infrastructure for collecting training data from thousands of consenting participants. Together, these data enabled us to develop generic sEMG decoding models that generalize across people. Test users demonstrate a closed-loop median performance of gesture decoding of 0.66 target acquisitions per second in a continuous navigation task, 0.88 gesture detections per second in a discrete-gesture task and handwriting at 20.9 words per minute. We demonstrate that the decoding performance of handwriting models can be further improved by 16% by personalizing sEMG decoding models. To our knowledge, this is the first high-bandwidth neuromotor interface with performant out-of-the-box generalization across people. A high-bandwidth neuromotor interface offers performant out-of-the-box generalization across people."

 Evading imminent threat from predators is critical for animal survival. Effective defensive strategies can vary, even between closely related species. However, the neural basis of such species-specific behaviours remains poorly understood1–4. Here we find that two sister species of deer mice (genus Peromyscus)5 show different responses to the same looming stimulus: Peromyscus maniculatus, which occupies densely vegetated habitats, predominantly escapes, whereas the open field specialist, Peromyscus polionotus, briefly freezes. This difference arises from species-specific escape thresholds, is largely context-independent, and can be triggered by both visual and auditory threat stimuli. Using immunohistochemistry and electrophysiological recordings, we find that although visual threat activates the superior colliculus in both species, the role of the dorsal periaqueductal grey (dPAG) in driving behaviour differs. Whereas dPAG activity scales with running speed in P. maniculatus, neural activity in the dPAG of P. polionotus correlates poorly with movement, including during visually triggered escape. Moreover, optogenetic activation of dPAG neurons elicits acceleration in P. maniculatus but not in P. polionotus, and their chemogenetic inhibition during a looming stimulus delays escape onset in P. maniculatus to match that of P. polionotus. Together, we trace species-specific escape thresholds to a central circuit node, downstream of peripheral sensory neurons, localizing an ecologically relevant behavioural difference to a specific region of the mammalian brain.

Whereas the isochorismate synthase pathway has been fully identified2–4, the PAL pathway remains incomplete. Here we report the full characterization of the PAL pathway for SA biosynthesis via functional analysis of rice (Oryza sativa) SA-DEFICIENT GENE 1 (OSD1) to OSD4. The cinnamoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) ligase OSD1 catalyses the conversion of trans-cinnamic acid to cinnamoyl-CoA, which is subsequently transformed to benzoyl-CoA via the β-oxidative pathway in peroxisomes. The resulting benzoyl-CoA is further converted to benzyl benzoate by the peroxisomal benzoyltransferase OSD2. Benzyl benzoate is subsequently hydroxylated to benzyl salicylate by the endoplasmic reticulum membrane-resident cytochrome P450 OSD3, which is ultimately hydrolysed to salicylic acid by the cytoplasmic carboxylesterase OSD4. Evolutionary analyses reveal that the PAL pathway was first assembled before the divergence of gymnosperms and has been conserved in most seed plants. Activation of the PAL pathway in rice significantly enhances salicylic acid levels and plant immunity. Completion of the PAL pathway provides critical insights into the primary salicylic acid biosynthetic pathway across plant species and offers a precise target for modulating crop immunity. Characterization of four SALICYLIC ACID-DEFICIENT GENEs in rice identifies an ancestral pathway for biosynthesis of salicylic acid from phenylalanine and provides genetic targets for engineering disease resistance in crop plants."

 In their landmark study1, Fecht and Johnson unveiled a phenomenon that they termed the ‘entropy catastrophe’, a critical point where the entropy of superheated crystals equates to that of their liquid counterparts. This point marks the uppermost stability boundary for solids at temperatures typically around three times their melting point. Despite the theoretical prediction of this ultimate stability threshold, its practical exploration has been prevented by numerous intermediate destabilizing events, colloquially known as a hierarchy of catastrophes2–5, which occur at far lower temperatures. Here we experimentally test this limit under ultrafast heating conditions, directly tracking the lattice temperature by using high-resolution inelastic X-ray scattering. Our gold samples are heated to temperatures over 14 times their melting point while retaining their crystalline structure, far surpassing the predicted threshold and suggesting a substantially higher or potentially no limit for superheating. We point to the inability of our samples to expand on these very short timescales as an important difference from previous estimates. These observations provide insights into the dynamics of melting under extreme conditions. Gold samples can be heated to more than 14 times their melting point while retaining their crystalline structure, far surpassing the predicted entropy catastrophe threshold and suggesting a substantially higher or potentially no limit for superheating."

 Mycorrhizal fungi are ecosystem engineers that sustain plant life and help regulate Earth’s biogeochemical cycles1–3. However, in contrast to plants and animals, the global distribution of mycorrhizal fungal biodiversity is largely unknown, which limits our ability to monitor and protect key underground ecosystems4,5. Here we trained machine-learning algorithms on a global dataset of 25,000 geolocated soil samples comprising >2.8 billion fungal DNA sequences. We predicted arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal fungal richness and rarity across terrestrial ecosystems. On the basis of these predictions, we generated high-resolution, global-scale maps and identified key reservoirs of highly diverse and endemic mycorrhizal communities. Intersecting protected areas with mycorrhizal hotspots indicated that less than 10% of predicted mycorrhizal richness hotspots currently exist in protected areas. Our results describe a largely hidden component of Earth’s underground ecosystems and can help identify conservation priorities, set monitoring benchmarks and create specific restoration plans and land-management strategies.

Here, authors introduce a reversible calcium additive that regulates polysulfides chemistry and catalyzes sulfur redox reactions, improving energy density with stable cycling. 
 Realizing practical lithium–sulfur batteries with high energy density requires lean electrolyte design. However, under low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratios, highly concentrated lithium polysulfides in the electrolyte phase limit cycling and capacity. Here, we report that a small amount of Lewis acidic calcium cation in the electrolyte addresses the problems of lean electrolyte lithium–sulfur batteries. Because of its Lewis acidity, Ca2+ readily converts lithium polysulfides into CaS and S8, preventing electrolyte jamming, polysulfide shuttle and Li corrosion. The in situ-formed CaS catalyzes the reduction reaction of lithium polysulfides. Ca2+ rejuvenates via electrochemical oxidation of CaS during charging, enabling a sustainable interconversion between Ca2+ and CaS during cycling. Li-S pouch cells with Ca2+ additive delivered an energy density of 493 Wh kg−1 (E/S of 2.4 μL mg−1) based on the total mass of the cell excluding external packaging, with 70% capacity retention at 220 cycle under 1 mA cm−2 discharge, and 346 Wh kg−1 (2.9 μL mg−1) with 77% capacity retention at 360 cycle under 1.0 C 2 mA cm−2 discharge. The judicious integration of lithium-sulfur and calcium-sulfur chemistries offers a handy but effective approach to overcome the long-lasting trade-off between energy density and cycling stability in the development of lithium–sulfur batteries.

 CD4+ T cells are crucial for protective immunity to intracellular pathogens. In addition to secreting cytokines, CD4+ T cells promote control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection through cognate interactions with macrophages, but the mechanism has been unclear. Here, we show that SLAMF1/CD150 is highly and uniquely induced in macrophages by antigen-specific interactions with CD4+ T cells. In macrophages, SLAMF1 enhances the generation of reactive oxygen species and restricts Mtb replication. Mtb-infection of mice promotes SLAMF1 expression specifically on infected macrophages, not uninfected bystanders. SLAMF1 expression depends on adaptive immunity and also autophagy. Moreover, Slamf1−/− mice have higher Mtb burden and more rapid disease progression than wild type mice. Using Slamf1fl/fl conditional knock-out mice, we show that in vivo Slamf1 is specifically required in macrophages to restrict mycobacterial growth and limit IL-1β production. In macaques, macrophage SLAMFI expression also correlates with T cell responses and protection. Combined, these data demonstrate that SLAMF1 is a marker of macrophage-T cells interactions, and it promotes protection against Mtb.

Here the authors propose pseudochaotic many-body dynamics, which is indistinguishable from chaotic dynamics and can generate pseudorandom states using polylogarithmic-depth circuits. 
 Quantum chaos is central to understanding quantum dynamics and is crucial for generating random quantum states, a key resource for quantum information tasks. In this work, we introduce a new class of quantum many-body dynamics, termed pseudochaotic dynamics. Although distinct from chaotic dynamics, out-of-time-ordered correlators, the key indicators of quantum chaos, fail to distinguish them. Moreover, pseudochaotic dynamics generates pseudorandom states that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar-random states. We construct pseudochaotic dynamics by embedding a smaller k-qubit subsystem into a larger n-qubit system. We demonstrate that a subsystem of size

 The endogenous opioid system provides powerful control over emotions, nociception, and motivation among many other fundamental nervous system functions. Its major components include a panel of opioid peptides that activate four canonical inhibitory opioid receptors. However, its regulatory principles are not fully understood including the existence of additional receptors and other elements. In this study we report the identification of a receptor for the opioid peptide dynorphin. By conducting a screen of a custom library of neuropeptides, we found that orphan receptor GPR139 binds to and is activated by a series of dynorphin peptides. Unlike other opioid receptors, GPR139 couples to Gq/11 and avoids β-arrestin, providing excitatory signaling that homeostatically scales the inhibitory response of neurons to dynorphin. This introduces a non-canonical dynorphin receptor as an essential component of the opioid system.

 Oil repellency is essential for enabling self-cleaning, anti-soiling and stain-repelling properties, which has broad application in industries liked textiles, healthcare and electronics. While per-and-polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exhibits strong oleophobicity, their environmental and health risks have led to prohibition on long-chain PFAS ( ≥ C8) and restriction on short-chain PFAS (C4, C6). However, there are few alternative materials demonstrating comparable oil repellency. Here, we introduce a novel method to fletch polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) brushes with ultrashort PFAS (singe -CF3, the least toxic PFAS), achieving oil repellency similar to short-chain PFAS while drastically reducing the fluorine content. This work highlights that liquid-like molecular design, rather than chain length, can enable sustainable oil repellency, facilitating a smoother transition away from PFAS reliance.

 Stable and predictable wet-season rainfall is crucial for soybean production in Brazil. However, climate and land-use changes, particularly Amazon deforestation, have increased rainfall variability in the region in recent decades. Here, we investigate long-term growing-season rainfall changes over two major soybean breadbaskets in Brazil from the perspective of atmospheric moisture transport. Utilising a novel moisture tracking framework based on a Lagrangian model guided by observations, we identify moisture source regions where evaporation contributed to rainfall over these breadbaskets. Furthermore, we quantify the relative contributions of source evaporation versus atmospheric (thermo)dynamics changes to downwind rainfall variability. Our results indicate that deforestation-induced evaporation declines have negatively impacted downwind rainfall in the breadbasket regions. However, strengthened circulation, evidenced by increased water vapour transport and low-level wind speeds consistent with decreased tree cover, has enhanced moisture transport from upwind regions (including Amazonia and the Atlantic Ocean) to the Brazilian soybean breadbaskets. This highlights the compensatory effects of deforestation on rainfall through decreased evaporation and altered atmospheric (thermo)dynamics, and how these effects may influence downwind soybean productivity in South America. Further understanding these interactions is critical for developing land management strategies to mitigate the agricultural impacts of climate change in the region."

 Robust predictions of shoreline change are critical for sustainable coastal management. Despite advancements in shoreline models, objective benchmarking remains limited.

Subsets of shoreline observations at an undisclosed site (BeachX) over short (5-year) and medium (50-year) periods were withheld from modelers and used for model benchmarking. Using satellite-derived shoreline datasets for calibration and evaluation, the best performing models achieved prediction accuracies on the order of 10 m, comparable to the accuracy of the satellite shoreline data, indicating that certain beaches can be modelled nearly as well as they can be remotely observed. The outcomes from this collaborative benchmarking competition critically review the present state-of-the-art in shoreline change prediction as well as reveal model limitations, facilitate improvements, and offer insights for advancing shoreline-prediction capabilities.

 Sea-ice in the Southern Ocean plays a crucial role in transporting and redistributing freshwater/salt and heat via freezing, melting, and transport. Changes in northward freshwater transport by sea-ice and its melt are suggested to change the salinity of intermediate water and stratification, which could affect the global carbon budget. However, very few observational studies have estimated the ice-melt amount because of the complexity of the melting processes. Here, we estimate the ice-melt amount from the salinity deficit caused by the ice-melt, using ~25,000 spring hydrographic data. The spatial distribution of ice-melt reflects the northward advection of coastal thick-ice and its melting via the three cyclonic gyres. Combined with the estimation of sea-ice production, we further estimated the net freshwater flux by sea-ice in the Southern Ocean on an observational basis. It shows large latitudinal variations: a change from negative to positive at 62°S, suggesting its dominant role in the budget.

 No-till management is often recognized for its environmental and economic benefits, but its potential to reduce climate warming is still uncertain. Beyond ongoing debate over its effects on soil carbon storage, no-till also leaves plant residue on the surface, which can reflect more sunlight. This increase in surface reflectivity, called albedo, may help mitigate climate change by reducing the energy absorbed by the land. Here, we assessed this climate benefit of no-till across the U.S. Corn Belt using conservation survey records, county-level tillage data, and satellite observations. We found that no-till increased land surface brightness during the dormant season, reducing absorbed solar energy by an estimated 50 grams of CO2 equivalent per square meter per year. Regionally, this could add up to 24 teragrams of CO2 equivalent per year in potential climate benefits. Areas with low adoption, especially those with dark, carbon-rich soils, offer the greatest opportunity for further mitigation.

Using the Community Earth System Model 2—Large Ensemble, we examine two distinct periods: 1950–1979, with relatively stable temperatures due to aerosol-induced cooling offsetting greenhouse gas warming, and 1985–2014, marked by rapid warming. During 1950–1979, heatwave trends were weak and non-robust, with internal variability explaining over 80% of the variability.

 Deadwood and decaying wood are the most important components for the biodiversity of boreal forests, and around a quarter of all flora and fauna in Finnish forests depend on them, with third of these species being red-listed. However, there is a severe lack of stand-level deadwood data in Finland, as the operational inventories either focus on the large-scale estimates or omit deadwood altogether. Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are a cost-effective method for remotely mapping small objects, such as fallen deadwood, over compartment-level areas, as even the most spatially accurate commercial satellites and aerial photography provide 30 cm ground sampling distance, compared to less than 5 cm that is easily achievable with UAVs.In this study, we utilized YOLOv8 by Ultralytics for detecting and segmenting standing and fallen deadwood instances from RGB UAV imagery. Our study consists of two geographically distinct study areas in Finland, Hiidenportti National Park and Evo. We manually annotated around 13 800 deadwood instances to be used as the training and validation data for the instance segmentation models. These annotations were also compared to field-measured deadwood data from Hiidenportti to assess the extent on how much of the deadwood can even be seen from UAV imagery. We also compared how the models perform on another area than from which its training dataset was from, and whether adding data from another areas to the training dataset improves the performance compared to training only with images from one location.The best performing model achieved test set mask mAP50 score of 0.682 for Hiidenportti and 0.651 for Sudenpesänkangas datasets. For both areas, including imagery from the another area improved the instance segmentation metrics, whereas using data only from another site to train the models produced significantly worse results.

 Poverty is a pervasive global issue that adversely affects human well-being. Traditional socioeconomic censuses are time-consuming and resource-intensive, suffering from temporal delays, while reliance on nighttime light data with low spatial resolution is insufficient for fine-scale identification of impoverished regions. Furthermore, the spatial heterogeneity of nighttime light in different urban functional zones has been overlooked. To address these shortcomings, we proposed a novel approach by integrating high-resolution SDGSAT-1 nighttime light data (10 m) with urban functional zoning data using a spatial overlay tool. A random forest model was then applied to predict county-level poverty identification in Guangdong, China. For comparative validation, traditional NPP-VIIRS nighttime light data (500 m) were also incorporated. This method effectively explored the nonlinear relationship between nighttime light, urban functional zones, and the multidimensional poverty index (MPI, serving as the dependent variable). Our experiments demonstrate that the integration of urban functional zoning with nighttime light moderately improves the accuracy of poverty estimates. Among the models tested, the one considering functional zoning-based indicators of “number of light pixels” and “sum of pixel light values” increased the correlation coefficient by 0.0158 compared to the model without considering these indicators. Additionally, comparative analysis revealed that high-resolution data from SDGSAT-1 exhibited a better fit with the MPI when integrated with functional zoning-based indicators. Specifically, the correlation coefficient of this combination was 0.0086 higher than that of traditional NPP-VIIRS data. This highlights that SDGSAT-1 can delineate the boundaries between dark and light regions more precisely, leading to a more accurate reflection of regional poverty levels. Our findings facilitate fine-scale poverty estimation across large regions. This approach can inform policy design, such as dynamic optimization of resource allocation based on poverty estimates, thus enabling timely and accurate poverty alleviation efforts."

 Serving as a powerful proxy in remote sensing studies, spectral indices can generate meaningful environmental interpretation from either raw or atmospherically corrected spectral data, and characterise and quantify some important properties of various objects on Earth’s surface. However, while numerous spectral indices have been developed over time, since the very launch of civilian satellites until now, some critical issues in their usage, such as comparability, remain scarcely studied, which may lead to incorrect, inconsistent, and unreliable results.In this study, we collected 471 spectral indices of various environment components (vegetation, water, and soil) that might be leveraged for soil studies, and traced their popularity in scientific publications over the past decades. The bibliometric analysis revealed a growing interest and utilisation of spectral indices as Earth-observing satellite technology advanced. Based on both literature and, for sake of complementation and illustration, some targeted regional-scale case studies, we discuss the issues of naming confusion, comparability, applicability, accuracy trade-offs, and reproducibility of using spectral indices.Overall, this overview provides an extensive list of spectral indices, both soil indices and soil-related indices, that can be useful for characterising these environment components by remote sensing. It draws attention to some misuses and confusions that must be avoided to prevent scientific pitfalls. The comparisons between different spectral indices, sensors, and correction methods, highlight the confusing effects that the misuse and non-standardised practices of the spectral indices useful for soil, may have on soil property mapping and monitoring.

 The remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) varies with the illumination and viewing geometry, an effect referred to as anisotropy, bidirectionality, or bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). In the aquatic environment, bidirectionality arises from the anisotropic downwelling illumination, scattered by water and particles in varying proportions as a function of the scattering angle, and modulated by the two-way interaction with the sea surface. For remote sensing applications, it is desirable that the reflectance only depends on the inherent optical properties (IOPs). This process implies transforming Rrs into a “corrected” or “normalized” Rrs,N, referred to the sun at the zenith and the sensor zenith angle at the nadir. A recent review study (D'Alimonte et al., 2025) compared published BRDF methods, showing the better performance of that developed by Lee et al. (2011, henceforth L11) with respect to those proposed by Morel et al. (2002) and Park and Ruddick (2005). This article presents a new method starting from L11's analytical framework, named O25 after OLCI, the Ocean Colour sensor on Sentinel-3 satellite. O25 has been calibrated with a recently published synthetic dataset tailored to its needs (Pitarch and Brando, 2025). A comparative assessment using the same datasets as in D'Alimonte et al. (2025) concludes that O25 outperforms L11 and hence all pre-existing methods. O25 includes complementary operational features: (1) applicability range, (2) uncertainty estimates, and (3) a demonstrated reversibility of the bidirectional correction. O25's look-up tables are generic to any in situ and satellite sensors, including hyperspectral ones. For sensors such as Landsat/Sentinel 2, the IOPs retrieval component of O25 can easily be reformulated."

 The radiometric temperature of the plants is known to be a good indicator of their level of water stress. The use of thermal cameras on board UAVs allows operational monitoring of the canopy temperature in orchard plantations at the single-tree level. The radiometric processing of the flight data becomes critical in this task to maintain the accuracy provided by field measurements using proximal thermal radiometers. This work focuses on evaluating the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) as a good indicator of the plant water status in almond orchards. This study compares the performance of CWSI by three different techniques: i) using proximal high-precision thermal radiometry (CWSI_CIMEL); ii) by UAV thermal flights for canopy temperature assessment (CWSI_UAV) and iii) combining multispectral and thermal data, also by UAV, to run a simplified two-source surface energy balance for the traditional formulation of the CWSI in terms of canopy transpiration (CWSI_STSEB).This study was conducted on two commercials almonds (Prunus dulcis (Mill.) D.A. Webb) orchards located in Albacete (SE Spain), one of them with 3 irrigation treatments (well-watered, moderate water stress, and severe water stress). Periodic measurements of stem water potential (SWP) were carried out around noon throughout 3 experimental campaigns from 2019 to 2021. Canopy temperature measurements were made with a high-precision thermal radiometer, the CIMEL CE312-C2. In addition, six flights were carried out using a DJI-M600 drone equipped with a FLIR Tau2 thermal sensor and a Micasense RedEdge camera. Maps of the CWSI were performed during these dates, showing temporal and spatial variability. The three different techniques showed similar CWSI trends across dates and treatments. When treatments were pooled within the same date, the assessment with SWP measurements showed correlations (R2) of 0.86, 0.68, and 0.70 for CWSI_CIMEL, CWSI_UAV, and CWSI_STSEB, respectively. These results reinforce the potential of accurate measurements of radiometric canopy temperatures using both proximal and remote sensing techniques to reproduce the crop water status in almond orchards. However, this study points to the necessity for accurate sensor calibrations and an appropriate methodology for the treatment of both canopy temperature and meteorological data. Monitoring CWSI serves as an operational tool for the early detection of water deficits in almond trees and meets farmerś needs to improve water use efficiency and optimize irrigation scheduling at the plot level."

 Sufficient abundance and variety of field site sampling are crucial for obtaining an accurate reach-scale river classification of a regional stream network in support of scientific research and river management. However, many studies still randomly select field sites or only visit accessible streams. This leads to an inadequate exploration of stream characteristics, resulting in incomplete or inaccurate classification. Machine learning has been recognized for discovering and extracting streams’ geomorphic patterns efficiently and accurately from data, but its application in field site sampling design is still in its infancy. This study developed a general and practical field site selection framework by incorporating machine learning in a human-in-the-loop manner. This framework includes three steps: (1) initial field site selection via machine learning from prior datasets, (2) selected field site accessibility evaluation and observation, and (3) additional field site decision and selection via an iterative learning process. In an example application to the San Francisco Bay Area (California, USA), our framework extracted representative geomorphic characteristics of (i) previous known stream types from prior labeled and geospatial datasets and (ii) previously unrecognized stream types based on uncertainty information obtained by machine learning. Moreover, we propose methods for replacing inaccessible sites to ensure sufficient information is retained in the selected field sites. Results revealed clear differences in variable distributions between the 148 high‐certainty sites and the 51 high‐uncertainty sites, a pattern that was validated by our field surveys. Furthermore, the 41 newly identified high‐uncertainty sites were found under-represented in the initial surveyed sites and thus their selection for the next round of field surveys will help fill the important feature gaps left by the initial survey. The feasibility of this framework allows river scientists and land use decision-makers to better understand river patterns and manage spatial planning."

The mean PM2.5, PM10, NO2, BC, and O3 concentrations at the participants' baseline addresses were 14.65, 21.02, 20.25, 0.92, and 50.77 μg/m3, respectively. Our study found no association between the pollutants investigated and lung cancer incidence. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals for lung cancer incidence associated with 5-year moving average exposures to PM2.5, PM10, NO2, BC, and O3 were 0.95 (0.75–1.20) per 2.68 μg/m3, 0.93 (0.78–1.12) per 2.81 μg/m3, 0.95 (0.83–1.08) per 7.98 μg/m3, 0.96 (0.86–1.08) per 0.34 μg/m3, and 1.05 (0.90–1.21) per 7.04 μg/m3, respectively, in the fully adjusted model.

 To quantitatively characterize atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition in a key agricultural region, dry and bulk N deposition were measured at five sites (Fuzhou, Taining, Shanghang, Changting, and Wuyishan), in Fujian province of southeastern China over the past decade. Dry deposition of ammonia (NH3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was estimated using the influential method, multiplying gaseous N concentrations by the deposition velocity simulated using the GEOS-Chem model. For bulk deposition the amounts of NH4+-N and NO3−-N were obtained by multiplying the N concentrations in rainwater by the precipitation amount. Long-term in situ observations (from 2010 to 2020) indicated that bulk N deposition decreased by 17.4 % during the monitoring period. Notably, from 2016 to 2020, total N deposition significantly decreased by 22.2 %, with an average value of 27.5 ± 1.23 kg N ha−1 yr−1. This was mostly caused by a reduction in reduced N deposition. N deposition exhibited distinct seasonal variability, determined by the amount of precipitation: dry deposition reached its peak in autumn, whereas bulk deposition was at its highest in spring and summer. The ratios of reduced to oxidized N in dry deposition, bulk deposition, and total N deposition were 3.23, 1.03, and 1.39, respectively, indicating a strong influence of agricultural sources. Our results show that atmospheric N deposition is a significant source of N to cropland and surrounding forest ecosystems in Fujian province. As such, it should be incorporated into N management strategies for crop cultivation to achieve sustainable agricultural and ecological protection."

 The positive Indian Ocean Dipole (pIOD) acts as a key precursor to La Niña formation, yet the dynamical interactions between pIOD and concurrent El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases remain insufficiently understood. Through an analysis of reanalysis datasets and simulations from the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LENS), this study demonstrates that 64.2 % of observed pIOD events coincide with concurrent El Niño, aligning with a frequency of 57.1 % in CESM-LENS simulations. The probability of subsequent La Niña development following pIOD-El Niño coexistence reaches 54.7 % in reanalysis data and 59.0 % in CESM-LENS simulations, escalating to 75.6 % for intense pIOD episodes and 82.5 % under conditions of concurrent strong El Niño events. Spatiotemporal analysis reveals distinct transition mechanisms governed by Pacific background states. During periods of pIOD-El Niño coexistence, oceanic advection (51.7 %) works synergistically with surface heat flux (22.2 %) to collectively dissipate warm anomalies. In contrast, under pIOD-Neutral conditions, intensified zonal advection (61.7 %) predominantly facilitates cooling processes. Two key findings emerge from this analysis: (1) The intensity of the pIOD directly modulates both the likelihood and magnitude of subsequent La Niña, with stronger initial pIOD substantially enhance development probabilities; (2) Concurrent ENSO states determine the dominant physical drivers at play—El Niño coexistence enabling a multi-mechanism cooling while Neutral conditions necessitate accelerated advective processes. These findings demonstrate that combinations of pIOD-ENSO phases create distinct thermodynamic pathways for initiating La Niña events, carrying significant implications for seasonal forecasting. The identified intensity-dependent relationships and phase-specific mechanisms provide a framework for improving climate predictability, particularly under evolving climate conditions that may alter tropical basin interactions."

 The rainy season in South China is predominantly influenced by monsoon and tropical cyclone (TC) weather systems. However, due to the lack of long-term observational data, the microphysical characteristics of raindrop size distributions (DSDs) associated with these systems remain insufficiently understood. This study utilizes five years (2016–2020) of 2DVD observations to analyze the differences in DSD characteristics of monsoon and TC rainfall. The results indicate that monsoon rainfall exhibits higher concentrations of medium to large raindrops (diameter > 2.1 mm), along with larger mean rainfall rates (R) and mass-weighted mean diameters (Dm), but lower normalized intercept parameters (Nw) compared to TC rainfall. Distinct differences in the mean normalized DSDs are observed between monsoon and TC rainfall. Convective rain under both systems shows the characteristics of maritime convective rain. Additionally, the relationships between kinetic energy (KE) and R, KE and Dm, as well as radar reflectivity (Z) and R, differ between monsoon and TC rainfall. TC events have relatively humid atmospheric conditions and higher wind speeds, resulting in the presence of a large number of small raindrops. These findings enhance understanding of the DSD characteristics under different synoptic regimes and provide valuable implications for improving rainfall KE estimation, DSD retrieval, and quantitative precipitation estimation over South China."

Combining functional circuit dissection and causal in vivo interventions in mice, we here investigate a built-in peptidergic regulatory system that restricts LC noradrenergic output. In particular, we characterize a population of neuropeptide Y (NPY)–expressing neurons surrounding LC noradrenergic cells. We show that this peri-LCNPYpopulation exerts neuromodulatory inhibitory control over the LC via NPY-Y1R signaling. Under naïve conditions, this results in bidirectional control of anxiety-like behaviors. Stressful experiences recruit peri-LCNPYneurons, leading to local NPY release in vivo, whereas enhanced peri-LCNPYneuronal activity curbs anxiety after stress. Together, we establish a causal role for peri-LCNPY–mediated neuromodulation of the LC in the regulation of anxiety, providing mechanistic insights into the endogenous systems underlying adaptive responses to adversity."

Behaviorally, manipulating VIP neuronal activity left probabilistic classical conditioning unaffected but severely impaired reversal learning. Physiologically, conditioned cue-associated VIP neuronal responses changed abruptly after encountering an unexpected reward. They also conveyed strong reward prediction error signals during behavioral reversal, but not before or after, unlike pyramidal neurons that consistently conveyed error signals throughout all phases. Furthermore, the signal’s persistence across trials correlated with reversal learning duration. These results suggest that mPFC VIP neurons play crucial roles in rapid reversal learning, but not in gradual value updating under stable probabilistic contingencies, by monitoring salient deviations from ongoing environmental contingencies and imposing error-correction signals during behavioral adjustments.

However, these landscapes potentially present a paradox: They may increase local biodiversity and thereby strengthen biotic resistance of native communities to global change winners, i.e., species that thrive under global change, such as invasive alien species or temperature- or nutrient-tolerant species. However, they may also improve landscape-scale habitat conditions, such as habitat connectivity, which facilitates the dispersal of global change winners, thereby accelerating biodiversity loss. Despite increasing investment in biodiversity-friendly landscapes, this paradox and underlying processes remain largely unquantified. We analyzed 2050 repeated, systematic vegetation surveys across the Swiss farmland and found the hypothesized facilitating and inhibitory effects on global change winners, but, overall, the inhibitory effects were stronger.

Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a promising therapy for PDAC; however, its clinical efficacy is limited by a high recurrence rate. Here, using a preclinical PDAC model, we characterized the tumor immune microenvironment following insufficient IRE (iIRE) through single-cell RNA sequencing. We found that iIRE induces a CCR2+tumor-associated macrophage (CCR2+TAM)–mediated immunosuppressive microenvironment in residual tumors. Consequently, we developed a macrophage-based proteolipid vesicle (mPLV) coencapsulating the CCR2 antagonist PF-4136309 (PF) and gemcitabine (GEM), named PF/GEM@mPLV. Our findings suggest that PF/GEM@mPLV achieves high drug accumulation within tumors through iIRE-induced inflammation. Reduction of CCR2+TAMs enhances antitumor immunity and improves chemotherapeutic response. PF/GEM@mPLV markedly inhibits tumor recurrence following iIRE, diminishes hepatic metastases, and prolongs survival in preclinical PDAC models. These findings uncover the role of CCR2+TAMs in iIRE-induced immunosuppression, offering a promising strategy to enhance the clinical potential of IRE in PDAC."

We achieve this result through a chemical bond transition, converting multilayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) to molybdenum nitride (MoN), which serves as a buffer layer to engineer a preferred orientation for the epitaxy of the overlying GaN film. Using this method, we also demonstrate the growth of an AlGaN/AlN/GaN heterostructure with high electron mobility exceeding 2000 square centimeters per volt per second.

However, mesoscopic-scale tumor heterogeneity across entire brain remains poorly characterized. To address this, we integrated micro-optical sectioning tomography (MOST) with high-precision three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction analysis to map pathological features of orthotopic glioma at submicron resolution across whole mice brain. Our findings uncovered significant heterogeneity in glioma invasiveness, vasculature, and compensatory angiogenesis while precisely delineating NP distribution throughout the tumor. Notably, early-stage glioma co-opted and migrated 680-micrometer upstream along the main cerebral artery within 4 days after glioma implantation. Blood-brain barrier permeability gradually increased during glioma progression, enabling NP penetrated via large-diameter vessels instead being restricted to capillaries.

Beyond mRNA,FUSgenerates partially processed transcripts retaining introns 6 and 7. We demonstrate that these FUSint6&7-RNA molecules form nuclear condensates, scaffolded by the highly structured intron 7 and associated with nuclear speckles. Using hybridization-proximity labeling proteomics, we show that the FUSint6&7-RNA condensates are enriched for splicing factors and the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) reader YTHDC1. These ribonucleoprotein structures facilitate posttranscriptional FUS splicing and depend on m6A/YTHDC1 for integrity. In cells expressing mutant FUS, FUSint6&7-RNAs become hypermethylated, which in turn stimulates their condensation and splicing. We further show that FUS protein is repelled by m6A. Thus, ALS-FUS mutations may cause abnormal activation of FUS posttranscriptional splicing through altered RNA methylation. Notably, ectopic expression of FUS intron 7 sequences dissolves endogenous FUSint6&7-RNA condensates, down-regulating FUS mRNA and protein. Our findings reveal a condensation-dependent mechanism regulating FUS splicing, with possible therapeutic implications for ALS."

During detachment, a vacuum is formed within the tube, leading to strong underwater adhesion. The artificial tube feet show high adhesion hysteresis, autonomous release by external stimuli, and immediate detachment by pneumatic actuation with integrated system. The temporary underwater adhesive inspired by the tube feet of starfish enables functionality in underwater robotics and is demonstrated through underwater manipulation of rocks."

In solid-state NMR (SSNMR), resolution is primarily constrained by instrumentation rather than molecular tumbling, making it well suited for studying large and complex systems. To fully leverage UHF magnets for SSNMR, it is essential to eliminate line broadening arising from magnetic field drift and couplings among the nuclear spins. We address these challenges using external2H lock to compensate for the field drift and long-observation-window band-selective homonuclear decoupling to suppress13C homonuclear couplings.

This dual activation supports sustained energy metabolism during osteogenesis and challenges the canonical antagonism between mTORC1 and AMPK. We developed CitraBoneQMg, a citrate-based biomaterial incorporating these components via one-pot synthesis. CitraBoneQMg provides sustained release, photoluminescent and photoacoustic imaging capabilities, and tunable mechanical properties. In vitro, it promotes osteogenesis by enhancing alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, osteogenic gene expression, and calcium deposition.

These heritable brain dynamics were mainly associated with genes involved in neurotransmission, expressed along a topographical gradient that mirrors psychological functions, including attention, planning, and emotional processes.

Unlike rigid, fused sulfone moieties, our flexible SS improves interfacial water contact and charge transport. P-2SO2, with sulfone-functionalized SS, represents a 237% improvement over the control polymer, PBDTTSO. In addition, P-2SO2demonstrated an outstanding hydrogen evolution rate of 1060.1 micromoles per hour and an apparent quantum yield of 32.4% (460 nanometers). Molecular dynamics simulations indicate SS improves hydrophilicity and water/polymer interface while promoting a hairpin-like conformation that increases intrachain π-π stacking for better charge hopping.

This splitting rapidly transports surface waters to depth, with sustained vertical velocities of 60 meters per day, primarily from the center of the eddy where carbon concentrations are largest, facilitating efficient transfer of phytoplankton carbon to depth, below the well-mixed, sunlit surface layer.

Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that increased solvent uptake elongates the spheres, raising interfacial energy and causing sphere splitting. The additional layers generated from the sphere splitting present a nonconventional lattice, typically not observed in thin films. Using these structures, we fabricate bimetallic nanodot arrays, where two different metal components are positioned alternatingly. This array exhibits higher catalytic activities compared to the homometallic nanopatterns, with the ultralow mass of noble metals below 300 nanograms per square centimeter, highlighting their potential as electrochemical catalyst platforms."

The ventral pallidum (VP) is central to drug addiction, and its glutamatergic neurons (VPGlu), whose activation drives aversion, inhibit drug seeking. However, it remains unknown whether these neurons encode the abstinence from and relapse to drugs. We show here that VPGluprojections specifically to the aversion-related lateral habenula (LHb) and ventral tegmental area gabaergic (VTAGABA) neurons show plasticity induced by abstinence from and reexposure to cocaine or cocaine cues. Both these pathways potentiate during abstinence and restore baseline values upon drug reexposure but with different plasticity mechanisms. Last, inhibiting the VPGlu→ LHb pathway enhances cocaine preference after abstinence, while inhibiting the VPGlu→ VTA pathway shows variable effects. These findings establish an aversive circuit orchestrated by VPGluneurons encoding long-term abstinence-driven changes that may contribute to drug relapse."

We find that CONUS surpasses the 3 °C-warming threshold (relative to 1921–1950) between the mid-2020s and early 2040s across all 30 ensemble members. Despite similar spatial patterns of annual mean surface temperatures over the CONUS in the 3 °C-crossing years, the simulated heatwave days are clustered into four distinct spatial patterns: Southeastern, Mountain-Central, Western-Severe, and Western-Mild. The Western-Mild pattern is the most frequent (19 out of 30 realizations) with the fewest annual heatwave days, while the remaining patterns tend to experience a greater number of annual heatwave days and are less common (3 or 4 out of 30). We present four case studies corresponding to the representative clusters to better understand local extreme heat storylines, highlighting how the maximum annual mean temperature at the local scale might differ from the continental scale.

An observational study,"Despite the growing evidence on the associations between greenspace and violent crime, there is a lack of research on the urban greenspace’s influence on the associations between ambient temperature and violent crime. This observational study examined the risk differences by community’s greenspace level using various greenspace indicators. Our time-series analysis modeled the associations between daily mean temperature (°C) over two lag days (lag0–1) and daily counts of violent crime during summer (May–September) in each ZIP code in Chicago, IL (2001–2023), adjusting for confounding factors. Our random-effects meta analysis analyzed estimated the pooled relative risk (RR) at the 80th summer temperature percentile compared to the reference temperature (10th percentile) across the ZIP codes. Our meta-regressions analyzed how the ZIP code-specific relative risks (RRs) differ by the number of parks, sum of park areas, percentage of vegetated area, percentage of recreational vegetated area, vegetation density (30 m), percent tree coverage, and percent street-level tree coverage aggregated at the ZIP code level. A total of 1075 959 counts of violent crime were included in our analysis. We found 8% (95% CI: 7%–10%) higher risk of violent crime incidents when the daily mean temperature was at the 80th percentile (25.9 °C) compared to the reference temperature (8.6 °C). The pooled RR was significantly lower in ZIP codes with the highest vegetation density (RR = 1.085 [95% CI: 1.040–1.131]) compared to those with the lowest vegetated density (RR = 1.124 [1.088–1.162]). The RR was significantly lower in ZIP codes with the highest percentage of tree coverage (RR = 1.088 [1.046–1.132]) compared to the ZIP codes with the lowest percentage of tree coverage (RR = 1.123 [1.086–1.162]).

This study generates a dataset of high-resolution divergence and vorticity profiles using the measurements of a radar wind profiler mesonet in Beijing. The negative divergence and positive vorticity are present ahead of rainfall events. This suggests that this dataset can help improve our understanding of the pre-storm environment and has the potential to be applied in weather forecasting. 
 Low-level convergence and cyclonic circulation are one of the most important dynamic variables in governing the initiation and development of convective storms. Our ability to obtain high-resolution horizontal divergence and vertical vorticity profiles, nevertheless, remains limited largely due to the lack of vertical wind observations. To fill this data gap, a high-density mesonet consisting of six radar wind profiler (RWP) sites has been operated in Beijing, which has allowed for continuous observations of three-dimensional winds with high vertical resolution. This paper aims to produce a temporally continuous horizontal divergence and vertical vorticity dataset at the vertical resolution of 120 m, which is derived from horizontal winds measured by the RWP mesonet in Beijing using the triangle method. This dataset is generated at intervals of 6 min for the whole year of 2023, covering the altitude range of 0.51–4.11 km. The dynamic variables from RWP mesonet are found to scatter sharply as opposed to those from ERA5 that are concentrated around zero, especially at high altitudes. In particular, the negative divergence and positive vorticity are detected in the low-level troposphere up to 1 h in advance of the occurrence of rainfall events, and their magnitudes increasingly become greater when the time comes closer to the rainfall onset, exhibiting the key role that the dataset plays in rainfall nowcasting. This is indicative of, to some extent, the effectiveness of the high-resolution divergence and vorticity dataset in Beijing. The dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15297246 (Guo and Guo, 2024), which is of significance for a multitude of scientific research and applications, including convection initiation and air quality forecasting.

 Understanding global carbon dynamics and budgets under climate change, land-use shifts, and increasing disturbances re- mains challenging due to the limitations of existing coarse spatial resolution and short-term or discontinuous biomass datasets. In this study, we generated a new global annual above-ground biomass carbon (AGC) dataset at 8 km spatial resolution from 1993 to 2020. This dataset is derived from satellite radar backscatter data and integrates vegetation and climate information, such as tree cover, tree density, and background climate data, to enhance the accuracy of global AGC mapping. Our dataset estimates an average global above-ground carbon stock of 378 PgC, aligning with other global estimates. We observe a slight gross increase of 1.18 PgC in global vegetation above-ground biomass carbon stocks from 1993 to 2020, with relatively stable variation. This reflects a balance between above-ground biomass carbon gains and losses across different biomes. Temperate and boreal forests are the primary contributors to global vegetation above-ground biomass carbon gains from 1993 to 2020, with increases of 0.4 and 0.5 PgC, respectively. In contrast, gross above-ground biomass carbon losses are predominantly observed in global tropical forests (-10.7 PgC) and global shrublands (-1.0 PgC). This suggests non-forest vegetation may offset the large above-ground biomass losses in tropical forests. Notably, El Niño events in 2015/16 triggered significant pantropical AGC losses of approximately -2.86 PgC, and regions with reported tree mortality events (Hammond et al., 2022) exhibited local AGC density declines of -0.34 MgC/ha. This long-term, temporally continuous, and moderate-resolution dataset provides a valuable resource for understanding biomass carbon dynamics and integrating these processes into Earth System Models.

However, the consistency across the increasing suite of datasets is unclear, limiting the comparability of findings derived from different datasets and variables. We find overall low consistency of numerous state-of-the-art precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff, and soil moisture datasets in terms of the water balance. Meanwhile, the water balance consistency varies across space, sources, variables, and time. 
 The proliferation and diversification of hydrological datasets have significantly advanced hydrological research. However, the coherence across these datasets remains poorly understood, hindering the comparability of findings derived from different data sources and variables. Here, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art hydrological datasets exhibit overall low consistency when evaluated through the lens of water balance – specifically, the relationship between variations in soil moisture and the difference between precipitation, evapotranspiration, and runoff. Our analysis reveals that satellite-based precipitation datasets generally show the highest consistency, while gauge-based datasets perform better in densely monitored regions of the Northern Hemisphere. For evapotranspiration, runoff, and soil moisture, reanalysis datasets demonstrate broader areas of higher consistency compared to gauge- or satellite-based products. Spatial patterns of consistency are strongly influenced by aridity and temperature, which affect measurement and modelling accuracy, while vegetation cover further modulates the performance of soil moisture datasets. Notably, dataset consistency has improved significantly in northern mid-latitudes over recent decades, likely reflecting advancements in observational technologies and the effects of climate warming. These findings underscore the importance of continued efforts to enhance dataset coherence and reliability for robust hydrological assessments."

The dataset supports a wide range of applications, from coastal change monitoring and erosion risk assessment to climate adaptation planning, conservation, and coastal geology. 
 We present a globally consistent, high-resolution (100 m) coastal typology dataset derived from satellite imagery and elevation data using deep learning—the first application of its kind in coastal science. Using a supervised multi-task convolutional neural network, we classified nearly 10 million coastal transects (one million km of coast) into four coastal attributes along the cross-shore profile: (1) sediment type, (2) coastal type, (3) presence or absence of built environment, and (4) presence or absence of human-made coastal defenses. The model, trained on about 1800 globally distributed samples, achieves strong predictive performance with F1 scores ranging from 0.67 to 0.83. Results show that the global coastal sediment distribution consists of approximately 40 % sandy, gravel, or shingle; 21 % muddy; 13 % rocky; and 27 % with no sediment. Considering the coastal type, 33 % of coasts are cliffed, 22 % are sediment plains, 15 % are wetlands, and 3 % are dune systems (i.e. 26,000 km). Combining sandy, gravel, shingle, and muddy sediments, we estimate that 61 % of the global coastline consists of soft sediments that are potentially easily erodible. Among sandy, gravel, or shingle coasts specifically, 20 % are cliff-backed and 16.5 % are located on built-up coasts. This global dataset, available in a cloud-optimized format at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15599096, provides a robust foundation for coastal change analysis and erosion assessment, and enables new opportunities for broad-scale vulnerability mapping and adaptation planning in the face of accelerating sea-level rise."

This study compares a weather model (WRF) with real data across five North and Baltic Sea sites. Adjusting the model improved accuracy over the widely used ERA5. In key offshore regions, LLJs occur 10–15 % of the time and significantly boost wind power, especially in spring and summer, contributing up to 30 % of total capacity in some areas. 
 Low-level jets (LLJs), characterized by wind speed maxima in the lower part of the atmospheric boundary layer, play a crucial role in shaping wind resource availability, particularly as modern wind turbines reach heights exceeding 200 m. Understanding the climatology of LLJs is essential for optimizing wind energy assessments in offshore environments. We leverage wind measurements from lidars and a mast at five sites in the North and Baltic seas to evaluate the ability of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and the widely used reanalysis ERA5 to characterize LLJs and use the optimal WRF setup to generate a detailed 5-year climatology. We test the sensitivity of LLJ representation to key WRF model configurations, including grid spacing, vertical resolution, surface layer (SL), and planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterizations.Results reveal that LLJ representation strongly depends on the PBL scheme, with LLJ frequency varying by more than a factor of 3 across configurations. For example, the Mellor–Yamada–Janjic (MYJ) scheme favored LLJ formation, while Yonsei University  (YSU), BouLac (BL), and Mellor–Yamada–Nakanishi–Niino (MYNN) 2.5 (with bl_mynn_mixlength=0) were less prone. The best-performing setup employed scale-aware subgrid mixing (km_opt=5; 3DTKE), accurately capturing LLJ occurrence rates, intensity, and vertical profiles. In contrast, ERA5 significantly underestimated LLJ frequency and failed to resolve key features, highlighting its limitations for detailed LLJ analysis.The 5-year LLJ climatology provides new insights into the spatial and seasonal distribution of LLJs, offering valuable guidance for offshore wind resource assessment and planning in the region. In the North and Baltic seas, LLJs occur along the western sea basins around 10 %–15 % of the time, with average jet heights between 140–220 m, which are well within the height of operation of modern wind turbines. The most LLJ-prone region is east of southern Sweden, especially during spring and summer, where LLJs contribute to up to 30 % of the wind capacity. In spring and summer, strong coastal gradients are observed in jet timing, height, and direction, particularly along eastern shorelines. Strong variations in the mean duration are also seen, with the longest-lasting jets occurring in the Southern Bight."

This study elucidates the dual-function role of pyrite in mediating the oxidative and reductive degradation of three model antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole, SMX; norfloxacin, NOR; and chlortetracycline, CTC) under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Systematic batch experiments coupled with reactive oxygen species analysis reveal a dual-function mechanism for pyrite involving oxidative degradation via •OH under aerobic conditions and reductive transformation under anaerobic conditions. Notably, sulfur species in pyrite serve as key electron donors, driving the defluorination and dechlorination reactions of NOR and CTC in the absence of molecular oxygen. X-ray absorption fine structure along with density functional theory simulations further demonstrate an S–Fe-antibiotic electron transfer pathway, wherein sulfide donates electrons via Fe(II) coordination sites. Field validation using natural estuary sediments corroborates the laboratory findings, highlighting the substantial contribution of pyrite-mediated reductive pathways to antibiotic attenuation. These findings advance the mechanistic insight into pyrite-driven redox processes in estuarine environments and underscore the overlooked role of sulfur species in mediating nonradical antibiotic degradation, with implications for natural attenuation and remediation strategies in sulfur-rich coastal systems."

This study examined the evolution of humic acid (HA, a representative of SOM) under simulated wildfire heating conditions (30–900 °C) in the presence of two representative soil minerals: montmorillonite (Mnt) and ferrihydrite (Fhy). Whereas Fhy accelerated the mineralization of HA, Mnt enhanced its preservation. These disparities stemmed from variations in the surface reactivity, structure, and transformations of Fhy and Mnt. Lewis acid sites, more abundant on Fhy surfaces than on Mnt surfaces, enhanced the decarboxylation of HA and caused carbon losses as CO2. However, Brønsted acid sites, which are more abundant on Mnt surfaces than on Fhy surfaces, enhanced carbon preservation by promoting HA isomerization and aromatization. Above 350 °C, lattice oxygen release from Fhy promoted the oxidative decomposition of HA, while Fhy itself underwent reduction to form magnetite, wüstite, and zero-valent iron. The confinement of HA within the micro/mesopores created by Mnt’s inert nanolayers prevented the thermal degradation of HA, enhancing carbon preservation.

In California, EV sales shares have steadily increased recently, and state policies to achieve 100% zero-emission vehicle sales by 2035 will further result in a rapidly growing number of EoL EV batteries. Based on modeling material flows and climate effects, in this study, EoL EV battery supply scenarios and the effect of recycling and second use on battery demand and saved greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are investigated on a regional level in California until 2050. The results indicate that stationary energy storage demands can be met by more than 100% by 2050 through the second use of EoL EV batteries. By contrast, recycling is expected to cover around 61% of the overall EV battery demand annually by 2050. Within system boundaries, the second use scenario, where EoL EV batteries are prioritized to be further used in stationary storage applications, shows potential cumulative GHG emission savings of about 55.8 MtCO2eq through the avoidance of battery production for stationary energy storage. Recycling of all EoL EV batteries results in GHG emission savings of about 48.3 MtCO2eq until 2050, driven by the replacement of primary raw materials in battery production. Finally, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis shows that adapting several model parameters, such as remanufacturing emissions, EV sales, battery lifetimes, and applied recycling processes, can have a substantial impact on the EoL EV battery supply and GHG emission savings by 2050."

However, they suffer from poor recyclability, disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation, and inefficient interfacial mass transfer. Therefore, we develop a gas–liquid–solid triphase photothermal catalysis (PTC)/chlorine system featuring a metal-free catalyst that regulates chlorine activation for superior EC removal and DBP control. This system achieves a high carbamazepine degradation rate constant of 0.38 min–1, which is 5.51 and 1.63 times that achieved by solar/chlorine and diphase systems. Moreover, PTC/chlorine can effectively degrade various ECs, including those lacking electron-donating groups, thus reducing their toxicity. This is attributed to the reduction of oxygen by photogenerated electrons to produce superoxide radicals, which regulate chlorine activation pathways to produce sufficient hydroxyl radicals for EC degradation while suppressing the generation of chlorine radicals, a major contributor to DBP formation. The PTC/chlorine system significantly suppresses DBP formation and DBP-associated toxicity by reducing chlorine exposure, promoting organic mineralization, and controlling pollutant degradation pathways. It is also highly practicable, as it remains largely unaffected by water matrices and possesses excellent reusability. The proposed triphase PTC/chlorine system thus represents an advanced, environmentally friendly, and sustainable chlorination process."

In particular, the polymerization is ineffective for recalcitrant phenolics and at low temperature, low initial concentration of phenolics, and high PDS dosage. The present contribution demonstrates that adding ferric chloride significantly enhances the removal efficiency, polymerization ratio, and PDS utilization efficiency, especially under the unfavorable conditions mentioned above. In the FeCl3-enhanced heat/PDS system, polymerization is promoted by iron-phenolic complexes, which favor the generation of more stable radical monomers through ligand to metal charge transfer. The ferrous ions thereby formed can accelerate PDS activation, thus synergistically contributing to polymerization. In comparison to the conventional mineralization-based advanced oxidation technologies, this process exhibits significantly higher oxidant utilization efficiency under a broad range of conditions, reducing PDS consumption by 85% when used for the treatment of real coking wastewater.

Here, we develop a machine learning model based on a compiled data set of 337 experimental observations to quantify antibiotic removal and map risk distribution in wetlands across 2,833 counties/districts in mainland China. Between 2010 and 2020, the wetland area across China expanded by 34.7%, yet antibiotic removal improved by only 0.1%, failing to meaningfully reduce the risk. We find that antibiotic removal in wetlands is primarily constrained by input magnitudes rather than the wetland area. To address this, we proposed a multistage wetland management strategy to enhance antibiotic removal by 27.6% in 2020 and high-risk area reduction by 90.6% under  optimal policies by 2035. Furthermore, we further identified the importance of wetland management strategies through an interpretable model. Our findings provide novel wetland strategy insights for policymakers and highlight the fact that wetland expansion without targeted management is insufficient for controlling antibiotic pollution, although it is an important cornerstone characteristic for water quality improvement."

Despite existing efforts being invested to develop antiscalants to inhibit silicic acid polymerization, antiscalants that mitigate silica scaling during membrane desalination have been rarely reported in the literature. Further, key factors governing the performance of antiscalants remain unclear for silica scaling. In this study, we employed a combination of experimental and simulation approaches to investigate the role of molecular functionality in regulating the efficiency of the antiscalant to mitigate silica scaling in membrane distillation (MD). Five antiscalants, which share a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) backbone but possess different functional terminal groups or molecular structures, were tested and compared for their performance in hindering silicic acid polymerization and mitigating water vapor flux decline due to silica scaling in static experiments and dynamic MD desalination, respectively. Specifically, PEG-based antiscalants with an ether or amine terminal group significantly extended water recovery of MD from ∼40% to over 70% when a feedwater containing supersaturated silica with a saturation index of 0.37 was used. We demonstrated that structural variations in terminal functional groups regulated the molecular properties of PEG-based antiscalants and greatly altered their inhibition efficiency in MD, which contrasted with results from static experiments on silicic acid polymerization. Scanning electron microscopy and molecular simulations reveal that the efficiency of antiscalants is determined collectively by the morphology of the silica scale, the molecular conformation of antiscalants in aqueous solution, and the tendency of antiscalants to reach the membrane surface. Our study sheds light on the mechanisms and design principles of antiscalants tailored to controlling silica scaling in membrane desalination."

However, the mechanisms linking groundwater NH4+-N enrichment to salinity and its interaction with dissolved organic matter (DOM) and soluble organic matter (SOM) remain unclear. In this study, the molecular characteristics of DOM and SOM in the Pearl River Delta aquifer systems were analyzed by using ultrahigh-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. Comparative incubation experiments were conducted to investigate DOM/SOM degradation pathways, their contribution to NH4+-N enrichment, and effect of salinity on DOM/SOM degradation. Results showed that DOM and SOM degradation involved the progressive degradation of aliphatic compounds, highly unsaturated compounds (HUC), and polyphenols (PPE) with lower O/C to HUC and PPE with higher O/C. Four major deamination reactions (hydrolytic deamination, oxidative deamination, reductive deamination, and ammonia elimination) were identified, and both DOM and SOM contributed similar to NH4+-N enrichment. Notably, salinity was found to influence the degradation pathways, facilitating the deamination of DOM/SOM by altering the molecular composition and microbial community structure. This study enhances the understanding of geogenic NH4+-N enrichment mechanisms in coastal groundwater and underscores the potential pollution risks associated with groundwater salinization."

Tang,Smart Membrane with Reversible Superwetting Transition for On-Demand Antifouling and Self-Cleaning,"Membrane wettability is crucial for filtration performance when treating feedwater containing inorganic particles, organic macromolecules, and microorganisms. Superhydrophilic membranes excel in resisting fouling during filtration, while superhydrophobic membranes are prized for their self-cleaning properties during maintenance. To address these contrasting needs, we herein propose a novel strategy by developing membranes with switchable superhydrophilicity and superhydrophobicity, enabling on-demand antifouling and self-cleaning. This membrane was created by electrodepositing copper oxides onto a copper mesh, resulting in the formation of hierarchical micro- and nanoscale structures. By applying a reduction voltage of –20 V, the copper oxides were converted into hydrophilic metallic copper, transforming the mesh into a superhydrophilic membrane. This transformation not only facilitated water permeation but also effectively repelled foulants during filtration. Remarkably, the gravity-driven permeation flux of the superhydrophilic membrane reached as high as 30,000 L·m–2·h–1. Furthermore, this superhydrophilic membrane demonstrated reasonable separation efficiency, achieving removal rates of 60.0% for total suspended solids, 93.1% for Melosira, and 83.0% for poly(vinyl alcohol). Upon heating at 100 °C for 1 h, the membrane surface reverted to a superhydrophobic state, enabling self-cleaning during membrane maintenance. With its facile preparation and smart electro- and thermo-responsive properties, this copper-based membrane, featuring reversibly switchable wettability, holds great promise for scalable applications in water treatment."

While their effects on fish brain chemistry and behavior are increasingly recognized, impacts on sensory systems such as vision remain largely unexamined. Here, we demonstrate that environmentally relevant mixtures of psychoactive drugs accumulate in the eyes of European perch (Perca fluviatilis) under both laboratory and field conditions, often at higher concentrations than in the brain. This ocular accumulation significantly alters neurotransmitter levels critical to visual processing. Our findings reveal a previously overlooked mechanism of sensory disruption with potential consequences for fish behavior, ecological interactions, and population fitness. Current environmental risk assessments, which rarely consider the visual system, may therefore underestimate the ecological impact of pharmaceutical pollution.

This study uses a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, APFoam, which integrates a comprehensive ozone (O3)─nitrogen oxide (NOx)─VOCs photochemical mechanism, to qualitatively evaluate the influence of VCPs emissions on pollutant distributions in the regular canyons (i.e., aspect ratio, AR = 1). Compared to scenarios without VCPs emissions, VCPs emissions at levels comparable to traffic emissions lead to an approximately 60% increase in the concentration of O3 within the street canyon. The pedestrian-level pollutant concentration and health risk were evaluated, suggesting that more nitrogen dioxide (NO2) exposure was on the leeward side, while the levels of O3 exposure were higher on the windward side, with health risk increasing by 1.6–2.2 times with increased VCPs emissions or reduced traffic emissions. A total of 39 emission scenarios, varying in traffic and VCPs emission strengths, were analyzed to assess different mitigation strategies, including traffic-only, VCPs-only, and combined reduction pathways (i.e., adjusting the traffic-to-VCPs emission ratio, T/V). The results indicate that the concentration of O3 can be effectively reduced only when T/V = 1:5, suggesting that substantial reductions in VCPs emissions are necessary to mitigate pollution. This finding underscores the need for increased focus on VCPs controls, even in the context of vehicle electrification, as traffic reductions alone are insufficient to curb the level of O3 pollution. The study provides critical insights for air quality management, emphasizing the importance of integrating VCPs emission controls into urban pollution mitigation strategies."

However, the impact of inconsistencies stemming from θ∗ ${\theta }^{\ast }$ on our understanding of LA feedbacks has not yet been examined. The present work, for the first time, conducts a comprehensive intercomparison of θ∗ ${\theta }^{\ast }$, regime properties (persistence, chances of transitioning, and temporal similarity), and LA coupling strength estimated using covariability of EF $EF$, dθ/dt $d\theta /dt$, and dTsoil $d{T}_{\text{soil}}$ with θ $\theta $. We find that θdTsoil∗ ${\theta }_{d{T}_{\text{soil}}}^{\ast }$, θEF∗ ${\theta }_{EF}^{\ast }$ and θdθ/dt∗ ${\theta }_{d\theta /dt}^{\ast }$ are in close agreement in semi‐arid and sub‐humid climatic regions characterized by herbaceous vegetation. dTsoil $d{T}_{\text{soil}}$ results in higher persistence of water‐limited regime and less frequent regime transitioning compared to EF $EF$ and dθ/dt $d\theta /dt$. However, θdTsoil∗ ${\theta }_{d{T}_{\text{soil}}}^{\ast }$ identifies similar regimes for >80%of the time in 84% of regime transitioning regions. The tipping potential of regimes identified by θdTsoil∗ ${\theta }_{d{T}_{\text{soil}}}^{\ast }$, θEF∗ ${\theta }_{EF}^{\ast }$ and θdθ/dt∗ ${\theta }_{d\theta /dt}^{\ast }$ is lowest during the dry seasons, which increases during the summer. dTsoil $d{T}_{\text{soil}}$ identifies stronger LA coupling over western USA, south‐central Australia and peninsular India, compared to EF $EF$ and dθ/dt $d\theta /dt$. Central Asian grasslands are identified to have mild LA coupling using dTsoil $d{T}_{\text{soil}}$, while EF $EF$ and dθ/dt $d\theta /dt$ do not indicate notable coupling.

Existing heat risk plans and responses often fail to account for the complex interdependencies among the various causes and impact pathways of heatwaves. Effective planning requires a system‐level understanding of these interdependencies to identify strategic entry points for action. This paper employs a participatory system mapping approach to explore the interconnections among causes, impacts, and response actions during the UK heatwave events of summer 2022. Cognitive maps were developed shortly after the events, incorporating input from 38 stakeholders across sectors involved in the heatwave response. These maps informed a forensic disaster analysis designed to provide a holistic understanding of the heatwave's causes, impacts, and adaptation measures. By analyzing the interdependencies among these factors, we identified cascading effects and amplifiers that significantly intensified heat risk in the UK. Notably, we find that the primary heatwave impacts were often indirect, emerging or worsening due to cascading effects such as wildfires, drought, transportation disruptions, and the overburdening of first responders. In many cases, adaptation measures were reactive, addressing isolated, short‐term impacts, while proactive, system‐level approaches tackling interconnected impacts and root causes, such as vulnerable buildings, at‐risk populations, and behavioral barriers, were largely absent. Additionally, we found notable variations in heat risk perceptions among groups. While individual sectors displayed a limited understanding of the broader heat risk system, a system‐level perspective emerged through the aggregation of cognitive maps.

 Disulfide bond shuffling (DBS) critically influences protein aggregation and stability, yet its spatial constraints and biological implications remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that insulin undergoes DBS within an extended spatial range up to ~19 Å, generating heterogeneous crosslinked oligomers that alter aggregation pathway. While DBS products initially delay aggregation by inhibiting primary nucleation and elongation steps, they ultimately promote the formation of distinct fibrillar structures with enhanced β-sheet content. Native ion mobility-mass spectrometry reveals molecular crosstalk between DBS products and native insulin via both covalent and non-covalent interactions. Notably, DBS-modified insulin fibrils exhibit significantly increased neurotoxicity in neuronal and pancreatic cells through mitochondrial apoptosis activation as supported by proteomic and biophysical analysis.

 Starships form a recently discovered superfamily of giant transposons in Pezizomycotina fungi, implicated in mediating horizontal transfer of diverse cargo genes between fungal genomes. Their elusive nature has long obscured their significance, and their impact on genome evolution remains poorly understood.

Mechanistically, loss of GSDME in proximal tubular cells facilitates the recruitment of OGT to the CUL4B-DDB1-WDR26 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, promoting OGT degradation and subsequently reducing STAT3 O-GlcNAcylation. This post-translational shift enhances STAT3 phosphorylation and induces upregulation of its downstream target gene, S100a7a. Elevated S100A7A promotes macrophage infiltration via RAGE activation, amplifying renal inflammation. Tubule-specific depleting S100a7a improves renal function and reduces renal injury and inflammation. These findings uncover a protective, non-pyroptotic function of GSDME in modulating O-GlcNAcylation and STAT3-S100A7A-RAGE signaling to maintain renal homeostasis under cisplatin stress in male mice. Gasdermin E (GSDME) is abundantly expressed, but its physiological function remains unclear. Here, the authors show a non-pyroptotic function of GSDME in limiting renal inflammation during cisplatin nephrotoxicity by regulating O-GlcNAcylation and STAT3-S100A7A-RAGE signaling."

This study shows that DNMT1 regulates cortical development by orchestrating the migration of postmitotic SST+ interneurons and their signaling to cortical progenitors, with implications for proper cortical architecture and function. 
 The coordinated development of cortical circuits composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons is critical for proper brain function, and disruptions are linked to a spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders. While excitatory neurons are generated locally in the cortical proliferative zones, inhibitory cortical interneurons (cINs) originate in the basal telencephalon and migrate tangentially into the cortex. Here, we show that DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is essential for the migration and integration of somatostatin (SST)-expressing interneurons in mice. Dnmt1 deletion causes premature exit of SST+ cINs from the superficial migratory stream and alters the expression of key developmental genes. Unexpectedly, Dnmt1-deficient SST+ interneurons also exert non-cell-autonomous effects on cortical progenitor cells, resulting in subtle yet lasting alterations in cortical layering. These findings propose a role for DNMT1 in governing the migration of SST+ interneurons and mediating their instructive signaling to cortical progenitor cells, thereby shaping cortical architecture and influencing long-term network function. The function of DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase 1) in these subsets of immature, migrating cortical inhibitory interneurons is not fully understood.

 Identifying receptors for bat coronaviruses is critical for spillover risk assessment, countermeasure development, and pandemic preparedness. While Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) uses DPP4 for entry, the receptors of many MERS-related betacoronaviruses remain unknown. The bat merbecovirus HKU5 was previously shown to have an entry restriction in human cells. Using both pseudotyped and full-length virus, we show that HKU5 uses Pipistrellus abramus bat ACE2 but not human ACE2 or DPP4 as a receptor. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of the virus-receptor complex and structure-guided mutagenesis reveal a spike and ACE2 interaction that is distinct from other ACE2-using coronaviruses. MERS-CoV vaccine sera poorly neutralize HKU5 informing pan-merbecovirus vaccine design. Notably, HKU5 can also engage American mink and stoat ACE2, revealing mustelids as potential intermediate hosts. These findings highlight the versatility of merbecovirus receptor use and underscore the need for continued surveillance of bat and mustelid species.

 As global urbanization accelerates, its potential impact on compound temperature-humidity extremes has become a critical concern for sustainable urban development. Here we examine spatiotemporal trends and urbanization effects on dry-hot and wet-hot extremes during the warm season (May-September) across 136 Chinese cities from 1981 to 2022. Results show a significant increase in both compound extremes, with wet-hot days rising faster (1.5 days per decade) than dry-hot days (0.3 days per decade). Amplification indices reveal that wet-hot coupling dominates, accounting for 36% of all hot days, while dry-hot coupling is relatively rare (4%). However, the mounting dry-hot amplification index indicates that extreme heat is increasingly coupled with drought. Urbanization, driven by impervious surface expansion and vegetation loss, intensifies both extremes, especially during rapid urbanization phases. These findings underscore the urgent need for adaptive urban strategies to mitigate the growing risk of compound temperature-humidity extremes under ongoing urbanization and climate change.

 Snow algal blooms lead to glacier and snow surface albedo reduction and subsequent melting. To explore snow algal distribution patterns and potential to cause blooms, we investigated snow algae in the Tibetan, Antarctic, Arctic, and Alps. Our results demonstrated that Tibetan and Alps had higher algal richness than Antarctic snow. Only 19 ASVs were shared among regions, with their relative abundance being lower in the Tibetan compared to the Arctic and Alps but similar in Antarctica. Furthermore, the algal community varied substantially across sampling sites, with 34% of the identified taxa endemic to Tibetan glacier snow. Cosmopolitan bloom-causing algae were scarce in most Tibetan Plateau snow, which was potentially limited by a low snow depth that prevented their growth. Alternatively, Hydrurus sp., which may cause golden-brown snow, was abundant (up to 54.4%) on Tibetan. Therefore, cosmopolitan and endemic species jointly enhance the potential of producing algal blooms in Tibetan glaciers.

 Lakes provide many vital ecosystem services but are highly sensitive to human impacts and climate change. While data needed to assess their long-term trajectories are generally unavailable, lake responses to such perturbations can be inferred from sediment archives, including records of chlorophyll, a proxy for primary production. However, few if any datasets exist to test hypotheses at large spatial scales about the drivers of long-term change. Here, we apply rapid hyperspectral imaging to produce high-resolution records of sediment chlorophyll (defined as the sum of chlorophyll a and b and their degradation products) in dated cores from 80 lakes across Canada and identify an overall increase since the mid-19th-century. Breakpoint analysis detected a shift whereby the average rate of chlorophyll increase was seven times greater after 1966 than before. We then compared spatiotemporal chlorophyll trends to climate variables, solar irradiance, and land-use data to assess their relationships to past changes in primary production. We identified robust correlations between chlorophyll and climate variables (temperature and ice cover) that were especially strong after 1966, suggesting continental-scale alterations to lake primary production in response to recent accelerated warming. We also detected significant associations with incident solar radiation and catchment human impacts, and show that both had the potential to influence past primary production at the continental scale.

Recent advancements in subsidence research have already integrated such approaches, primarily in flat to near-flat landscapes.

This approach is developed primarily using morphometric and meteorological variables over extensive mountainous areas (∼15,000 km2) and extended time windows (∼7 years). By aggregating the deformation signal at the Slope Unit scale while maintaining 12-day temporal intervals consistent with Sentinel-1 acquisitions, we achieve high modelling performance (PCC = 0.7).

 Atmospheric amines have gained significant attention for their role in new particle formation, nitrogen cycling, and climate change. To investigate their formation mechanisms and sources, year-round PM2.5 samples were collected in Xiamen, a coastal city in southeastern China. Samples were analyzed for methylamine (MA), ethylamine (EA), and dimethylamine (DMA) using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Total measured amine concentrations were higher in spring and winter than in summer and autumn, with an annual average of 24.9 ng m−3, dominated by MA (40.1 %). The dominant formation pathway of particle-phase amines varied seasonally. In summer and autumn, a strong correlation between amines and acidic ions highlighted the importance of acid-base chemistry in amine salt formation. Conversely, increased relative humidity (RH) and enhanced aerosol acidity in spring and winter favored direct dissolution. While atmospheric oxidation generally enhanced the gas-to-particle conversion of amines, evidence of amine degradation by oxidants was also observed in spring. Five sources of amines were identified using positive matrix factorization (PMF): biomass burning, secondary products, industrial emissions, coal combustion and agricultural emissions, and marine and dust emissions. During summer, autumn, and spring, secondary products were the primary contributors to amines, accounting for nearly or over half. However, in winter, combustion sources played a larger role. Although the dominant sources varied by season and episode during different high concentration episodes, combustion activities and secondary formation were generally identified as the major contributors. Backward trajectory analysis showed that pollutant transport from the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Pearl River Delta (PRD) regions significantly influenced amine levels in Xiamen. The PRD region showed substantial contributions from biomass burning and secondary products, whereas the YRD region was mainly linked to industrial emissions as well as coal combustion and agricultural emissions. These findings improve understanding of amine processes, offering valuable insights for targeted emission control strategies."

Mutation-selective covalent inhibitors spare RAS in healthy tissue and enable extended pharmacodynamic effect, but covalent targeting of RASG12Dis hindered by low nucleophilicity and high proteomic abundance of carboxylic acids. We overcame these challenges with compounds that bind cyclophilin A (CYPA) to create a neomorphic protein-protein interface between CYPA and active RAS that enables selective, enzyme-like rate enhancement of the covalent reaction between D12 and electrophilic warheads with exceptionally low intrinsic reactivity. This approach yielded orally bioavailable compounds with marked antitumor activity in multiple preclinical models of KRASG12Dcancers, including the investigational agent zoldonrasib (RMC-9805) currently undergoing clinical evaluation (NCT06040541)."

Here, we describe expansion in situ genome sequencing (ExIGS), a technology that enables sequencing of genomic DNA and super-resolution localization of nuclear proteins in single cells. Applying ExIGS to progeria-derived fibroblasts revealed that lamin abnormalities are linked to hotspots of aberrant chromatin regulation that may erode cell identity. Lamin was found to generally repress transcription, suggesting that variation in nuclear morphology may affect gene regulation across tissues and aged cells. These results demonstrate that ExIGS may serve as a generalizable platform with which to link nuclear abnormalities to gene regulation, offering insights into disease mechanisms."

We observed several signature properties of moiré phasons, such as increased vibrational amplitudes at solitons and AA-stacked regions.

Degraded tropical forests in particular may be approaching critical temperature thresholds even more rapidly than intact forests, with implications for tree survival and ecosystem recovery. We investigate thermal stress in degraded tropical forests within the Brazilian Amazon Arc of Deforestation. Using land surface temperature data from the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on the international Space Station (ECOSTRESS), we compared canopy temperatures of intact, selectively logged, and burned forests in Feliz Natal, Mato Grosso, Brazil. Upper canopy temperatures in previously burned forests were 4.1% higher (mean = 36.5 °C) and 50.9% more variable compared to intact and logged forests, which showed remarkably similar temperature distributions (means of 34.9 °C and 35.1 °C, respectively). Modeled leaf temperature distributions based on canopy temperature measurements from one of the warmest days in a 2 year dry season record indicated that 87% of leaves in the warmest burned forest patches exceeded the temperature threshold where respiration surpasses photosynthesis, compared to approximately 72%–74% in intact and logged forests, respectively, in the same time period. After controlling for environmental factors, burned forests were predicted to be 2.6 °C warmer on average [1.39 °C–3.96 °C, 95% credible interval] than intact forests across a 5–40 m canopy height range. Burned forests showed modest thermal recovery over time, with temperatures decreasing by approximately 1.2 °C over a 30 year recovery period. In contrast, logged forests showed minimal thermal differences from intact forests (−0.353 on average, [−1.125–0.274, 95% credible interval]) and negligible change (0.15 °C) over the same timeframe. While the absolute probabilities of exceeding damaging thermal thresholds remain low across all forest types under current climate conditions, the probability of leaves exceeding temperatures that cause permanent leaf damage was ten times higher in burned forests, with implications for the future of burned forest regeneration in water-limited regions of the Amazon basin. In particular, the combination of higher mean temperatures, greater temperature variability, and more frequent exposure to damaging thermal thresholds implies that burned tropical forests will experience substantially higher mortality rates and slower biomass recovery compared to intact and selectively logged forests, especially in water-limited regions where trees cannot rely on evaporative cooling to moderate canopy temperatures."

However, the dominant factors influencing vegetation restoration remain controversial. This study improved the Deep Crossing network by integrating bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) with embedding, creating the Deep Crossing LSTM Age (DC-LSTM-Age) network. It incorporates land cover type, forest age, and atmospheric environmental factors to reconstruct the leaf area index (LAI). We investigated the LAI increase (greening) driven by various factors and their dynamics in the Grain for Green Project (GGP) regions of the LP from 2001 to 2021. Results showed that DC-LSTM-Age network effectively simulated LAI values and its temporal dynamics in LCC regions, with superior validation performance (R2 = 0.87) compared to the Deep Crossing LSTM network (R2 = 0.84) that excluded forest age and the Bi-LSTM network (R2 = 0.79) that excluded forest age and land cover type. The greening trend in afforested regions (GGP-Forest, 0.013 m2 m−2yr−1) was much larger than in grass revegetation regions (GGP-Grass, 0.005 m2 m−2yr−1). Dominant drivers varied by restoration strategy: in GGP-Forest, LCC was the primary driver (0.25 m2 m−2, 52.9%), with an increasing impact over time. In GGP-Grass, atmospheric environmental changes dominated (0.127 m2 m−2, 78.5%), led by climate change (0.064 m2 m−2, 39.4%), CO2 rising (0.056 m2 m−2, 35%), and nitrogen deposition change (0.007 m2 m−2, 4.1%).

However, significant north-south striped noise in the models necessitates spectral filtering before estimating NSSs, resulting in signal attenuation and leakage. In this paper, we propose a one-step approach (OSA) that iteratively filters noise and estimates NSSs alongside trends and seasonal signals starting from unfiltered regional TWSA signals, where the covariance matrices of NSSs are populated using distance-based exponential functions. The non-seasonal TWSA signals in Southeastern China, estimated by OSA from April 2002 to December 2024, effectively preserves signal integrity with reduced spatial leakage and enhanced signal strength, aligning closely with those of the RL06 mascon products from CSR (Center for Space Research) and JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory), achieving Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.91 and 0.90. Moreover, we introduce a Standardized NSS (SNSS) index from OSA, which enhances the consistency with the standardized streamflow index, identifying the extreme wetness in pearl river basin (PRB) and Southeastern River Basin (SERB) from August 2015 to June 2016, and the extreme drought in Middle and Lower Yangtze River Basin (MLYRB) from July 2022 to April 2023.

Here, we quantify the impact of livestock farming on global burned area (BA), through a combination of a new parameterisation of grassland grazing intensity in the Wildfire Human Agency Model and generalised linear models of fire’s many additional biophysical dimensions. Results demonstrate that livestock farming has contributed to the decline in global BA, but perhaps more importantly, also has highly spatially heterogenous impacts. Specifically, results suggest that the contrasting distributions of livestock grazing intensity and pastoral burning likely contribute to the observed BA anomaly in the savanna grasslands of sub-Saharan Africa. Our results serve to highlight the major potential role of ‘prescribed grazing’ as a climate change adaptation measure and, more broadly, reiterate the importance of interactions between human and biophysical processes in driving the distribution of fire on Earth."

We used an extreme gradient boosting regression model to predict PMGEs based on all the indicators, excluding population. Using SHapley Additive exPlanations values, we identified the most relevant indicators. The model reveals that density and transit mitigate PMGEs, while car use and climate exacerbate it. The typology provides further insights into how these effects vary across network, mode share and development patterns. Ultimately, the typology can serve as a framework to identify relevant indicators and thereby guide the selection of strategies for effective, type-specific emissions mitigation."

This study aims to quantify the environmental impact of four potential waste management strategies for PLA in Belize: landfill, landfill expansion, cogeneration, and anaerobic digestion. A life cycle assessment was conducted with a functional unit of 1 kg of PLA at the end-of-life for each waste management scenario. Data from Ecoinvent V3.5 and process parameters from SimaPro V9.0 were collected and modeled in Microsoft Excel. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses were assessed. Environmental impact results showed that operational requirements contributed the most to the impacts for anaerobic digestion, while the landfill scenarios were dominated by transportation requirements, and the cogeneration scenario was dominated by material requirements. The anaerobic digestion scenario had the lowest net environmental impacts across half of the assessed categories, primarily due to energy generation from biogas production. Environmental impacts can be reduced by diverting PLA waste from landfills to anaerobic digestion and cogeneration facilities. Additionally, uncertainty was the lowest in the anaerobic digestion scenario for most of the assessed environmental impact categories. Sensitivity analysis revealed that environmental impact results were highly influenced by key model assumptions, such as those for PLA degradation, transportation distances, and technology-specific parameters, indicating that further data collection is necessary to enhance the accuracy of these results. Integrated solid waste management scenarios that incorporated combinations of anaerobic digestion and cogeneration were found to have lower net environmental impacts compared to the business-as-usual scenario. This study underscores the need for further research to evaluate the feasibility of integrating these waste management alternatives into Belize’s waste management system."

However, the impact of climate warming on national-scale FP occurrence remains a great challenge. This study aims to assess the spatiotemporal dynamics of FP occurrence and evaluate the contribution of historical climate change across China. Based on FP records from 1998 to 2019, we conducted temporal trend analysis and examined shifts in spatial centroids. Furthermore, we employed a hierarchical Bayesian model with Markov chain Monte Carlo method to quantify the effects of climate-related drivers. Our results show that while severe pest outbreaks have been largely controlled, the area affected by mild pest hazards has been gradually increasing. Additionally, a significant northward shift in the center of pest occurrences was observed (approximately 0.65° latitude per decade). Our hierarchical Bayesian model estimates that historical climate change contributed 48.0 ± 18.7% to pest occurrences, with temperature-related factors accounting for the majority. Notably, nighttime temperature variation had the largest positive contribution (27.4 ± 17.4%), whereas changes in daytime temperature had a spatially varied influence. Our findings indicate that climate warming, particularly nighttime warming, has driven the northward shift in FP occurrences, posing an increasingly severe threat to forest health in northern regions. These findings underscore the urgent need to address the risks posed by climate-induced FP hazards."

First, we trained and tested the AI models, using the occurrence probability of REs from simulated (input) data from five regional climate models and observed (output) river discharge data from 1962–2022. Then, we use the trained AI models to project the observation-constrained occurrence probability of REs until 2099 and conduct principal component analysis for the robust selection of AI model ensembles. The observation-constrained projections detect more REs in Qmax and Qmin in the late 21st century than expected under the stationary system does, highlighting intensifying hydroclimatic extremes. The upper Indus River shows that the return period of REs in Qmax and Qmin is approximately 15 years. The Chenab and Kabul Rivers (Jehlum River) are prone to more REs in Qmax (Qmin), with a return period of approximately 11 years. Uncertainties in the RE occurrence probability projections from regional climate models can be attributed to the heterogeneity in hydroclimatic and physiographic characteristics across the study basins.

In this study, we present a novel cobalt-doped copper-based catalyst that employs an in situ benzoic acid-mediated oxygen activation strategy for the photocatalytic degradation of toluene under visible-light irradiation. Unlike traditional systems in which carbonyl intermediates contribute to catalyst deactivation, we demonstrate that benzoic acid, generated during toluene oxidation, acts as a potent ligand to modulate the electronic structure of cobalt sites. This interaction significantly enhances oxygen activation and promotes the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), facilitating the complete oxidation of toluene to CO2 with nearly 100% efficiency. In situ characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the migration of benzoic acid from copper to cobalt sites under visible light is critical for the oxidation process. This migration induces a pronounced electron-donating effect, enabling activation of the Co center, which drives efficient ROS production and autocatalytic mineralization of benzoic acid. The resulting Co-Vo-Cu catalyst demonstrates exceptional catalytic activity and stability, outperforming previous systems in VOCs degradation. This work offers new insights into the role of organic intermediates in oxygen activation and presents a promising strategy for the development of next-generation photocatalysts for VOCs elimination."

IL32, ADAM15, and IL8 demonstrated consistent negative associations with ≥4 exposure metrics. Twenty proteins were associated with both mixtures and individual air pollutants with consistent effect directions. These proteins were enriched in pathways linked to immunity and signaling.

This study proposes a chemical oxygen demand (COD) measurement method based on ultraviolet-visible spectrum analysis and machine learning (ML), taking into account the removal of interferences, including temperature, pH, turbidity, common anions and cations, as well as COD composition and different water environments. The data collected from the river and wastewater were processed through principal component analysis, and random forest (RF) performed the best among the multiclass models with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of only 6.73% for total COD (TCOD), dissolved COD (SCOD), and particulate COD (PCOD). RF has excellent transferability with an average MAPE of 8.17% for TCOD, PCOD, and COD in another real wastewater and river. Interpretability analysis elucidates the mechanism of PCA downscaling on the model. Techno-economic assessment revealed that this method incurs only 60.9% of the costs of laboratory monitoring and 49.3% of the costs of conventional automatic monitoring stations.

In this study, we investigated the kinetics of the multiphase reaction between sulfur dioxide (SO2) and formaldehyde (HCHO) in aqueous ammonium nitrate aerosol particles buffered by gas-phase NH3 at pH of 4.6 to 5.1 via well-controlled flow tube experiments. We found that high ionic strength inhibits the HMS formation rate in aqueous aerosol particles by up to a factor of 10 compared to that in dilute bulk solutions. Using the new kinetic parameters predicts a negligible formation rate of HMS in aerosol water relative to that in cloud/fog water for typical winter haze conditions in the North China Plain.

Key reaction parameters, including the ethylene glycol (EG)/PET ratio, catalyst loading, reaction time, and temperature, were systematically optimized, achieving complete PET conversion and a bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) yield exceeding 90%. The catalyst exhibited excellent reusability over four cycles, and its selectivity was demonstrated in mixed plastic waste systems where PET was effectively depolymerized, while bisphenol A polycarbonate (BPA-PC) remained largely unaffected. The comparison with BPA-PC highlights the specificity of the nZVI catalyst toward ester bond hydrolysis in PET, while BPA-PC, a carbonate-based polymer with a difference in structure and glycolysis reactivity, remained resistant under the same reaction conditions.

Understanding their human exposure is critical for the risk management of these nanomaterials. Once released into the environment, metal nanomaterials are prone to undergo sulfidation. This process significantly alters the physicochemical properties of the nanomaterials and subsequently, dictates the extents and pathways of exposure. Here, we show that sulfidation of nanosized Ag, ZnO, CuO, and Cu2O affects their macrophage uptake to varied degrees, by differentially regulating protein corona compositions and aggregation states of the nanomaterials. Sulfidation-induced changes in hydrodynamic diameters determine whether macrophage uptake occurs through endocytosis or phagocytosis. For a given uptake pathway, the extents of uptake depend on macrophage recognition of protein corona, the compositions of which are largely influenced by sulfidation. Specifically, increased abundance of transferrin and low-density apolipoprotein C2 in the corona as affected by sulfidation promotes clathrin-mediated endocytosis, while the enrichment of complement factor H facilitates uptake by complement receptor-mediated phagocytosis. The findings advance our understanding on the nanospecific mechanisms governing environmental behaviors and implications of nanomaterials, and further underline the importance of taking into account the aging processes in the risk management of these materials."

Here, we utilize data from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft to investigate the Martian bow shock, revealing its distinctive characteristics within our solar system. We find that unlike other planetary shocks, the reformation of Mars's bow shock driven by the ultra‐low frequency (ULF) waves is more global and less dependent on shock geometries. This distinct behavior is attributed to the broad distribution of ULF waves in the upstream region at Mars, generated not only by shock‐reflected ions but also by planetary protons. Additionally, during the reformation process, the amplitude of the ULF waves and the steepened structures are significantly large. This results in the newly reformed shock exceeding the original one, a phenomenon not observed at other planets under similar shock conditions. Therefore, the ULF waves significantly enhance the complexity of shock dynamics and play a more substantial role at Mars compared to other planets."

Since then, the area has experienced recurrent seismicity, including one of the largest human‐induced earthquakes so far (1967, Mw 6.3). An extensive deep drilling project was carried out to understand this seismicity. Earthquakes are modulated by the monsoon regime and reactivate steeply dipping faults/fractures located at 3–10 km depth in the crystalline basement at ambient temperature between 70°C and 170°C. Fault zone rocks recovered from KBH1, KBH6, and KBH7 wells (∼1.5 km deep) allowed us to reconstruct the sequence of deformation events. Steeply dipping faults/fractures often filled with chlorite (lowest formation temperature 129°C ± 41°C) and calcite (precipitated from meteoric‐derived fluids) record the last brittle deformation event. We conclude that reservoir‐triggered seismicity, driven by infiltration of meteoric water at depth, pore pressure diffusion, and poroelastic response of the rock mass to reservoir operations, occurs in sub‐vertical faults/fractures often filled with calcite and chlorite."

However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for this relationship remain poorly understood. Here we use simulations from Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project Phase 3 and 4 (PMIP3/4) to investigate equilibrium ΔMOT and its linkage to sea surface temperature changes between the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ∼21,000 years ago) and pre‐Industrial. Results show that PMIP3/4 simulations generally underestimate proxy‐based ΔMOT. Regression analysis reveals that LGM MOT is strongly modulated by mid‐latitude SST cooling, with the Southern Ocean having a greater influence compared to other oceanic regions, thus helping explain why models with similar ΔGMSSTs exhibit significantly different ΔMOTs. Additionally, we find a strong relationship between simulated Antarctic sea‐ice coverage and Southern Ocean SST changes, with implications for constraining sea‐ice reconstructions."

Such exposure has been identified especially in rifts that developed within former orogens. These rifts exploited zones of lithospheric weakness created during previous mountain‐building events. Here we investigate whether lower crustal exhumation during rifting could result directly from structural inheritance of prior orogeny. To this aim we use Wilson‐Cycle numerical models where we impose a prior shortening and subsequent extension. Our models incorporate the effects of thermal and structural inheritance as well as surface processes. We find that the erosion of mountain belts thins the upper crust, reducing the upper‐to‐lower crustal ratio prior to rifting. This process facilitates the exhumation of lower crustal material during extension, exposing them at the Earth's surface along the footwall of normal faults. We suggest a new conceptual model to explain lower crustal exhumation observed at rifted margins worldwide."

Hartmann,Effects of Ocean Heat Transport in Tropical Radiative Convective Equilibrium,"A global climate model is run in radiative‐convective equilibrium including a slab ocean with a specified ocean heat transport analogous to what is seen in the tropical Pacific. The insolation is varied to create a range of global mean equilibrium temperatures. These results are compared with experiments that do not include a specified ocean heat transport. The ocean heat transport cools the coldest Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) and increases the SST contrast. The warmest SSTs change much less with the addition of ocean heat transport because increased atmospheric transport moves energy away from the warm region. The ocean heat transport also increases the efficiency of cooling by outgoing longwave radiation in the subsiding region, allowing for a cooler global mean SST. At colder global mean temperatures ocean heat transport creates a high‐contrast state in which abundant low clouds play a strong role in maintaining the SST contrast. This high‐contrast state abruptly transitions to a warmer, low‐SST‐contrast state as the climate is warmed by increasing insolation. At warmer temperatures comparable to the current tropics, the low cloud response is less important than longwave emission in maintaining the SST contrast. Although ocean heat transport cools the climate, it does not much affect the sensitivity of the model climate to increasing insolation. Comparison of the model results to ERA5 reanalysis data shows that mechanisms responsible for the SST distribution and energy budget changes in this idealized model are analogous to variability that occurs over the tropical Pacific Ocean."

Here, the authors show that combining proteomics, transcriptomics, and genetic data reveals key drivers of heart failure, highlighting potential targets for treatment. 
 Pressure overload initiates a series of alterations in the human heart that predate macroscopic organ-level remodeling and downstream heart failure. We study aortic stenosis through integrated proteomic, tissue transcriptomic, and genetic methods to prioritize targets causal in human heart failure. First, we identify the circulating proteome of cardiac remodeling in aortic stenosis, specifying known and previously-unknown mediators of fibrosis, hypertrophy, and oxidative stress, several associated with interstitial fibrosis in a separate cohort (N = 145). These signatures are strongly related to clinical outcomes in aortic stenosis (N = 802) and in broader at-risk populations in the UK Biobank (N = 36,668). We next map this remodeling proteome to myocardial transcription in patients with and without aortic stenosis through single-nuclear transcriptomics, observing broad differential expression of genes encoding this remodeling proteome, featuring fibrosis pathways and metabolic-inflammatory signaling. Finally, integrating our circulating and tissue-specific results with modern genetic approaches, we implicate several targets as causal in heart failure.

Here, Rudd et al. identify Flower (FWE) as a novel regulator of lamellar body trafficking and a determinant of epidermal barrier function. 
 Specialized secretory cells, including keratinocytes in the last viable layers of mammalian epidermis, utilize lysosome-related organelles (LROs) to exocytose distinct cargoes vital for tissue function. Here, we demonstrate that the Flower isoform, hFWE4, a putative Ca2+ channel that permits endocytic retrieval of presynaptic vesicles and lytic granules, also resides on epidermal lamellar bodies (LBs), an LRO that extrudes a proteinaceous lipid-rich matrix to finalize the epidermal barrier. In differentiated keratinocyte cultures, we show that hFWE4-positive LB-like vesicles associate with a distinct ensemble of LRO trafficking mediators and demonstrate that hFWE4 liberates Ca2+ from intracellular stores to enable the surface presentation of cargo contained within these vesicles. Finally, supporting a critical role for hFWE4-dependent trafficking in establishing the epidermal barrier, we demonstrate that this process is dysregulated in genetic diseases of cornification that are driven by impairments in keratinocyte Ca2+ handling. Our results provide new insight into the biogenesis and trafficking of epidermal LBs and more broadly suggest that hFWE4 may serve as a core component of LRO trafficking machinery that endows Ca2+ dependency to distinct stages of the transport process depending on the cell of origin.

Here, authors introduce dual-bond fracture metamaterials that enable full-field energy dissipation, making it tougher, more versatile, and better suited for advanced structural applications. 
 Fracture resistance presents a pivotal challenge in mechanical metamaterials, as traditional designs often fail to mitigate crack propagation and enhance energy dissipation. Despite efforts to enlarge the fracture process zone, energy dissipation remains highly localized near the crack tip, restricting improvements in fracture toughness. This study introduces dual-bond fracture metamaterials that integrate weak and strong bonds to achieve full-field energy dissipation before crack propagation. Through the sequential breaking of weak bonds and the formation of plastic hinges, these materials redistribute stress across the entire structure, significantly expanding the fracture process zone and enhancing toughness. The specific fracture energy, a metric we propose to characterize structural fracture resistance, is governed by extrinsic energy dissipation and scales linearly with specimen size. Additionally, the concept of an equivalent force concentration factor is introduced to characterize fracture behavior in dual-bond fracture metamaterials. Gradient designs further enable asymmetric fracture sensitivity and surface crack shielding, thereby improving resilience in defect-prone environments. These metamaterials offer versatility, with potential applications in protective nets, shock absorbers, and blast containment vessels. Finally, the dual-bond design can be realized with a variety of materials, highlighting its generality and broad applicability for diverse engineering applications.

 Embryoless rice is valuable for studying early seed development and has great breeding potential, however, related research remains limited. Here, we show that mutations in OsBZR4, encoding brassinazole-resistance 4, lead to 60–100% embryoless seeds across different cultivars. OsBZR4 is specifically expressed at the scutellum-endosperm interface and regulates auxin levels and distribution during early embryo development. OsBZR4 represses the expression of YUC4 and PIN5b. Exogenous auxin and overexpression of YUC4 enhance the embryoless ratio, whereas the auxin transport inhibitor N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) decrease it. Higher temperatures increase the embryoless ratio in bzr4 mutant lines. The expression of OsPIL13 is induced by high temperature, and its overexpression enhances the embryoless ratio in both wild type and bzr4 plants. Introducing bzr4 mutant allele into some elite cultivars can improve milled rice yield and storability. Collectively, manipulating OsBZR4 can lead to the development of thermosensitive embryoless rice varieties with increased energy reserves and improved storability, potentially enabling novel rice production technologies.

 Tropical cyclones (TCs) dramatically disturb the upper ocean and leave subsurface temperature anomalies that persist beyond their lifetimes, representing an oceanic “memory” of TC activity. How this long-term memory affects large-scale ocean circulation remains an open question. Here, we use high-resolution (~0.1°) numerical experiments, in combination with observations, to assess TCʼs impacts on the Kuroshio current. We show that, collectively, Western North Pacific TCs induce subsurface warming to the right of the Kuroshio due to enhanced mixing and downwelling, and cooling along the Kuroshio main axis primarily through upwelling. In the climatological mean, TCs strengthen the upper right flank of the Kuroshio by ~15% while weakening its main axis by ~4% through geostrophic processes, resulting in a net reduction of the Kuroshio’s meridional heat transport by 0.02 ± 0.02 PW. On seasonal and interannual scales, TC-induced changes are comparable to the background variability of the Kuroshio, highlighting the long-term cumulative impacts of TCs on ocean circulations and climate.

 Chiral N-heterocycles such as piperidines and tetrahydroisoquinolines are privileged structural motifs in drug discovery and pharmaceutical industry. The development of efficient and practical asymmetric synthetic methods towards pharmaceutically important chiral N-heterocycles constitutes an important subject in synthetic chemistry. Asymmetric synthesis of 2,3-cis-disubstituted piperidines bearing two consecutive chiral centers is particularly challenging in terms of both diastereoselective and enantioselective control. In this work, a regiospecific and enantioselective cyclizative aminoboration is designed to tackle this problem by employing Cu/(S, S)-Ph-BPE as the chiral catalyst, leading to a series of 2,3-cis-disubstituted piperidines as well as C1-substituted tetrahydroisoquinolines in moderate to good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. The asymmetric six-membered ring-closing aminoboration features a broad substrate scope, mild reaction conditions, and excellent functional group compatibility.

 Phytoplankton are critical to the Antarctic marine food web and associated biological carbon pump, yet long-term shifts in their community composition are poorly understood.

 Antarctic meltwater could slow the abyssal circulation, which is essential for ventilating heat, carbon, and nutrients, thereby influencing global climate patterns and marine ecosystems. However, the impact of Antarctic meltwater on abyssal circulation under diverse melting scenarios remains underexplored. Here, we investigate the sensitivity of abyssal circulation to the location, rate, and duration of meltwater input using an Earth system model of intermediate complexity. The horizontal distribution of negative surface ocean density anomalies varies depending on the meltwater input regions and rates, with the circulation weakening most significantly, especially when meltwater effectively spreads into deep convection areas. Furthermore, experiments with different meltwater input rates and durations, while maintaining a constant total amount, suggest that more gradual input has a greater impact on reducing abyssal circulation.

 The Rio Grande Rise (RGR) oceanic plateau exhibits distinctly broad morphology compared to the linear, age-progressive Walvis Ridge (WR), despite both originating from the Tristan-Gough (T-G) plume. New 40Ar/39Ar ages (84–41 Ma) from RGR demonstrate prolonged coeval formation with WR at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) during a ridge-centered plume configuration. These plume-ridge interactions coincided with a temporary microplate eventually incorporated into the South American Plate, explaining RGR’s broader spatial distribution. Backtracking reveals that absolute plate motion and southward plume drift shut off excess magma supply when the T-G plume moved south of large lateral MAR offsets, ending volcanism on the South American plate around 52 Ma—later than previously estimated. Although RGR’s erupted volume matches large igneous provinces, magmatic production rates were moderate, resembling modern-day Iceland rather than high-flux terrestrial large igneous provinces. This supports a ridge-centered plume origin over a high-flux magma pulse, demonstrating how plume-ridge configuration and microplate tectonics controlled the evolutionary divergence of these related South Atlantic volcanic features.

 On Earth, the primary driver of crustal magmatism is generally viewed as exogenic, a manifestation of loss of primordial and radiogenic heat from the interior. However, a much higher impact flux during the Hadean and earliest Archean eons would have significantly contributed to the crustal heat budget on the early Earth. Here, we test this hypothesis using age, trace element, and oxygen isotope data from zircon grains from the Jack Hills, Western Australia, the oldest known terrestrial minerals. The chemical composition of the analyzed grains reveals a significant shift at around 3.9 billion years ago that is consistent with a transition from shallow to deeper melting, which we posit corresponds to the change from a thermal regime dominated by impacts to one dominated by heat loss from Earth’s interior. This change permitted continental crust to thicken, differentiate, and endure.

 The distribution changes of evergreen broad-leaved tree and shrub species (EVE) at the border of Mediterranean and temperate forests due to climate change and land-use changes necessitates accurate mapping techniques to support biodiversity monitoring and climate adaptation strategies. Remote sensing time series provide valuable data for vegetation analysis, yet functional-level mapping in mixed forests remains challenging due to limited observation data. To tackle this limitation, the present study investigates pretraining strategies for mapping EVE cover in selected Italian forest areas using Sentinel-2 time series and a probabilistic Convolutional Neural Network. Additionally deep ensemble-based uncertainty estimation is used to further enhance the interpretability of the output. We compare three model training strategies: (i) direct training on up-to-date but limited field data, (ii) supervised pretraining on a larger, diverse forest vegetation database before fine-tuning, and (iii) self-supervised pretraining on large-scale unlabeled time series before fine-tuning. Our results demonstrate that pretraining on contextually similar datasets in combination with a spatial split of training and validation data significantly enhances predictive performance and generalization to unseen regions in a cross-validation experiment. Additionally, we assess epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty to improve interpretability and identification of out-of-distribution predictions.

 Although the association between PM2.5 and anemia is biologically plausible, involving the iron regulation disruption by chronic systemic inflammation following particle exposure, existing epidemiological evidence is limited, especially among workers or considering particle components.We selected 372,290 workers in Guangdong Province in 2020 and used the yearly PM2.5 concentrations and its chemical components’ annual concentrations around their workplaces as the exposure. We employed the use of mixed-effects models to assess the associations of PM2.5 and its components with hemoglobin and anemia, further investigating the interaction between stratified variables (demographic characteristics and occupational variables) and the five components on anemia.For each interquartile range increase in the concentration of PM2.5 and its components (BC, NH4+, NO3-, SO42-, OM), the hemoglobin concentration decreased by 0.993 (95 %CI: 0.927, 1.059), 0.747 (0.681, 0.812), 0.939 (0.871, 1.007), 1.237 (1.167, 1.306), 0.982 (0.916, 1.047), and 0.798 (0.735, 0.862) g/L, respectively.

NO3- had the most significant effect on both outcomes. In addition, we found that interactions between stratifying variables and concentrations of the five components were predominantly significant for the prevalence of anemia (P for interaction <0.05), with different susceptibilities observed across age groups, genders, and subgroups of occupational variables.The study offers an in-depth examination of the potential impact of PM2.5 and its components on the prevalence of anemia among workers."

 Triplet excited states (3C∗) of organic compounds and singlet oxygen (1O2) are important oxidants in the atmospheric aqueous phase, yet their roles in the degradation of phenolic compounds (PhCs) remain poorly characterized. In this study, we investigated the aqueous-phase photochemical reactivity of five substituted phenols-eugenol, 4-ethylphenol (4-EP), 3-methylcatechol (3-MC), 4-nitrocatechol(4-NC) and 2,6-dimethoxy-4-methylphenol (DMMP)-in the presence of four triplet-state photosensitizers: 3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (DMB), benzophenone (BP), vanillin (VA), and 2-acetonaphthone (2AN). The contributions of reactive oxidative species (ROS), including 1O2, •OH, and 3C∗ were systematically examined using quenching and chemical prober technique. The second-order rate constants (kPhCs,3C∗)for reactions between PhCs and 3DMB∗ ranged from (1–6)✕109 M−1 s−1, following the reactivity order: 4-NC > DMMP > EUG>4-EP>3-MC. However, no consistent reactivity trend was observed across different triplet sensitizers, indicating that different triplet-state photosensitizer exhibit varying reactivity toward phenolic compounds. Contribution analysis confirmed that 3C∗ was the dominant oxidant, accounting for 60–89 % of the observed photodegradation. The steady-state concentrations of 3C∗ and 1O2 were estimated as [3C∗]ss=(5.6–9.6) × 10−14 M and [1O2]ss (1.3–3.4) × 10−13 M, respectively. The quantum yield coefficient (fTMP) of 3C∗ ranged from 90 to 3000 M−1, while the 1O2 quantum yield (Φ1O2) varied between 1 % and 50 %. A strong correlation between fTMP and Φ1O2 suggested that 1O2 is primarily produced via energy transfer from 3C∗.Quantitative structure–activity relationship model showed a moderate correlation between kPhCs,3C∗ and oxidation potentials of PhCs (r2 = 0.34–0.72), while Hammett plots revealed stronger correlation with substituent constants(r2 = 0.61–0.93), highlighting the dominant influence of electronic effects of substituents. Increased substituent numbers appeared to suppress the reactivity of PhCs toward 3C∗, suggesting a combination of steric and electronic inhibition. These results provide new insight into the 3C∗-mediated degradation mechanisms of phenolic compounds in atmospheric aqueous-phase."

 Deep moist convection significantly disturbs the evolution of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) through its convective cold pools (CCPs). This study investigates the statistics of CCPs and their impact on PBL turbulence as observed at the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO) site. To obtain a large dataset of CCPs, we adapted an existing CCP-detection algorithm for use in multilevel, micrometeorological data. Application of the algorithm to ATTO observations collected from August 2021 through December 2023 resulted in a dataset consisting of 410 CCPs. CCPs occur nearly every other day at the ATTO site, although they are most common from April through September and are least common from December through March. The occurrence of CCPs is linked to the diurnal cycle of the PBL, with more events around 1800 UTC and the less events around 1100 UTC. The strength of CCP perturbations varies strongly as a function of the distance from the canopy. Above the canopy (approximately 37 m), CCPs exhibit well-defined gust fronts, marked by sharp drops in temperature and humidity, gusting winds, overturning circulations, and pressure rises. During gust front passages, sensible (latent) heat fluxes are briefly enhanced and subsequently invert sign (weaken) in the CCPs, as previously unstable (moister) PBLs become stable (drier). Turbulence is stronger and more anisotropic during gust fronts and just above the canopy due to mechanical drag. Anisotropic turbulence may be transported upward to 200 m by the gust fronts. Below the canopy, CCPs and attendant perturbations are drastically damped, except in high-end cases."

 Diurnal temperature range (DTR) is an important climate indicator that exerts substantial effects on society as well as the environment, particularly on karst landforms where the ecosystem is vulnerable and sensitive to DTR. However, the space-time pattern of extremes of DTR and their relationship with wind speed over global karst regions remain poorly understood. In this study, we defined DTR extremes and investigated the spatiotemporal patterns of warm-season extremes and their relationships with wind speeds across global karst regions during 1980–2022. Our results reveal that arid zones such as the Middle East and northwestern China exhibit large long-term mean DTR and DTR extremes. There is an increase in the frequency of DTR extremes for most regions, though pronounced regional divergence of DTR trends exists. The intensity of DTR extremes show apparent increasing trends in North America and Europe, but in other regions decreased trends are prevailing. For most regions worldwide, declining wind speed trends are discerned, though slight increases are observed in the western United States. Moreover, wind speed is generally strengthened along with larger DTR. Daytime DTR extremes dominate North America, Europe and south China, while nighttime extremes are likely to occur in the Middle East and Asia. These findings advance the understanding of DTR extremes in fragile karst ecosystems, which could help for region-specific climate adaptation strategies."

To address this issue, we evaluated the SPPs and improved bias correction for foggy meteorological conditions in Southeast Asia. Three running versions of the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) were evaluated from 2014 to 2022 at the daily timescale. The assessment of the performance for Early-Run (ER), Late-Run (LR), and Final-Run (FR) was conducted based on statistical and categorical indicators. Then, the impact of foggy meteorological conditions on IMERG was analyzed. Finally, artificial neural networks (ANN) were employed to correct fog-affected estimates of precipitation. The main conclusions are: (1) The best performance is demonstrated by the FR, with a correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.443 and a probability of detection (POD) of 0.575. All running versions perform significantly better in the Indochinese Peninsula compared to the Southern Asia Archipelago. (2) Fog adversely affects the accuracy of IMERG precipitation estimates. In the FR, the presence of fog results in a decrease of 6.95 % in CC, and this effect intensifies during the rainy season, with fog reducing CC by 15.46 %.

We observed a distribution pattern of HAUS7 expression, suggesting that neuronal HAUS7 is transported from the cell body to the growth cone under the control of DOCK3. In addition, phosphorylation of DOCK3 at Y562 by tropomyosin receptor kinase B signaling leads to the dissociation of HAUS7, which is considered an important step for microtubule assembly. Deletion ofHaus7in mice significantly reduced microtubule formation and axon regeneration following optic nerve crush (ONC).

Trastuzumab (TZB), one of the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) used in combination with chemotherapy, has become a major therapeutic for HER2-overexpressing cancers. Current structural understanding of HER2 and its interactions with other receptors and with different affinity agents has relied on numerous structures of individual domains of HER2. Here, we subjected purified near full-length HER2 to single-particle cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis. Besides the canonical conformation described in previous structural studies, we report a previously unreported conformation of the HER2 extracellular domain that is stabilized upon TZB binding, which might hamper association with HER3, a receptor with which HER2 forms an oncogenic unit. Together, our findings provide insights into the conformational dynamics of the HER2 receptor and the mechanism of action of TZB."

The direction of net energy flux is prescribed by the dimensionality of the fluid system: Energy cascades to smaller scales in three-dimensional flows but to larger scales in two-dimensional (2D) flows. Manipulating energy flux is a formidable task because the energy at any scale is not localized in the physical space. Here, we report a theoretical framework that enables control over energy flux direction. On the basis of this framework, we conducted experiments and direct numerical simulations, producing a 2D turbulence with forward energy flux, contrary to classical expectations. Beyond theory, we discuss how our theoretical framework can have profound applications and implications in natural and engineered systems across length scale ranges from 10−3to 106meters, including enhanced mixing of microfluidic devices, biologically generated turbulence, breaking persistent coastal transport barriers, and ocean energy budget."

This narrative process is segmented into distinct units by event boundaries, which facilitate a replay process that acts to consolidate each event into a narrative memory. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) may synchronize neural activity during these processes. We use intracranial recordings from participants viewing and freely recalling a continuous, audiovisual stimulus. We find that hippocampal HFOs increase following event boundaries and hippocampal-cortical coincident HFOs (co-HFOs) occur in cortical regions that underlie event segmentation (inferior parietal, precuneus, lateral occipital, and inferior frontal cortices). Event-specific co-HFO patterns that occur during event viewing reoccur following event boundaries for the subsequent three events and during recall. This is consistent with models that support replay as a mechanism for memory consolidation. Therefore, HFOs may coordinate activity across brain regions that facilitate event segmentation, encode memory of discrete events, and bind representations to assemble memory of a coherent, continuous experience."

This is likely mediated by numerous noncoding regulatory elements that shape sex-specific transcriptomic programs. To explore the dynamics of these in detail, we performed paired time series of transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility assays on pre-granulosa and Sertoli cells throughout their development in the embryo, making use of new and existing mouse reporter lines. Regulatory elements were associated with their putative target genes by linkage analysis, and this was complemented and verified experimentally using promoter capture Hi-C. We identified the transcription factor motifs enriched in these regulatory elements along with their occupancy, pinpointing LHX9/EMX2 as potentially critical regulators of ovarian development. Variations in the DNA sequence of these regulatory elements are likely to be responsible for many of the unexplained cases of individuals with differences of sex development."

The vicious cycle between the inflammatory microenvironment (inflamed soil) and dysfunctional chondrocytes (degeneration-related seeds) drives the chronic progressive deterioration of OA. Here, we report a genetically engineered chondrocyte-mimetic nanoplatform (termed HKL-GECM@MPNPs) comprising a honokiol (HKL)–loaded mitochondrion-targeting nanoparticle core coated with an interleukin-1 receptor type 2 (IL-1R2)–overexpressing chondrocyte membrane. HKL-GECM@MPNPs fuse with OA chondrocytes, transferring IL-1R2 onto the plasma membrane and reprogramming the inflamed microenvironment through IL-1β blockade. Mitochondrion-targeting cores then directly deliver HKL to restore mitochondrial sirtuin-3 in OA chondrocytes, reprogramming the cells’ pathological phenotype. Intra-articular injection of HKL-GECM@MPNPs in OA mice reduces inflammation, alleviates joint pain, and mitigates cartilage damage through a synergistic effect. Moreover, HKL-GECM@MPNPs effectively reverse cartilage degeneration in human OA cartilage explants.

These non-chordate SFZE-containing enhancers exhibited activity in the zebrafish notochord. Furthermore, the SFZE syntax in a non-chordate confers endoderm activity. Our results indicate the ancient association of SFZE withbrachyury, likely predating the origin of animals. The emergence of notochordalbrachyuryexpression could be attributed to co-option of upstream signals acting on the conserved SFZE syntax, which facilitates the origin of the notochord from rudimentary endodermal cells."

Endocytosed PCYOX1L promoted plasma membrane expression of ASIC1a, and PCYOX1L secreted from astrocytes induced ASIC1a activity in neurons.

Despite these advances, our understanding of how Hippo signaling regulates transcription is less clear. To address this, we used live microscopy to study the nuclear behavior of the major Hippo pathway transcription effectors, YAP and TEADs. We reveal that TEADs are a major determinant of YAP DNA binding and nuclear mobility, while YAP minorly influences TEADs. YAP and TEAD1 associate with DNA for longer periods in cells with intrinsically low Hippo pathway activity and upon acute Hippo pathway perturbation. TEAD1 binds the genome on a broad range of timescales, and this is extended substantially in nuclear condensates. Last, a cancer-associated YAP fusion protein exhibits substantially different biophysical behavior than either YAP or TEAD1.

Spatiotemporal lineage-mapping combined with single-cell transcriptomics reveals that ectopic NeuroD1 induces astrocyte-to-neuron conversion specifically in lesion cores via transit-amplifying OLIG2+progenitors during early injury phase, but not in late phases or in nonreactive astrocytes. Neither a loss-of-function NeuroD1 mutant nor stemness-reprogramming factor SOX2 induces astrocyte-to-neuron conversion.

Furthermore, the distinct reactivity profile of PPAP donors—marked by a clear gap relative to other known donors and orthogonality to many standard activation methods—makes them well suited for modular, one-pot glycosylation strategies. Their ease of synthesis, robust performance in glycosylation, and compatibility with diverse assembly approaches collectively establish PPAP glycosides as powerful tools for the efficient construction of complex carbohydrates."

Among variants of this experiment, only electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) has been established to detect nuclei at interspin distances up to about 1.7 nanometers using19F labels. This limit is dictated by the ENDOR linewidth of 10 to 30 kilohertz, which appeared insurmountable given dipolar broadening of the detected nucleus with the nuclear spin bath. Herein, we present ENDOR experiments based on nuclear sublevel coherence spectroscopy that push the boundaries of ENDOR sensitivity and resolution by one order of magnitude. In particular, we introduce an experiment, in which the electron-nuclear dipolar interaction can be exquisitely extracted from other nuclear broadening mechanisms, thus enabling to access distance distributions. This methodology paves the way for structural studies using19F ENDOR in biomolecular systems. Moreover, it offers opportunities to access spin dynamics in electron-nuclear coupled spin systems."

Effective elimination or reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can halt disease progression and alleviate symptoms. This study presents an innovative thermoresponsive, metal-free carbon nanodot (CD) hydrogel, termed F-CD hydrogel, which exhibits potent neutralization capabilities against multiple free radicals, including OH·, O2−·, and ·DPPH. This hydrogel demonstrates remarkable antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic capacity, effectively relieving DED symptoms by eliminating ROS at their source. Furthermore, its thermosensitive characteristics enhance the adherence of CDs to the ocular surface. In mouse models of DED, the F-CD hydrogel accelerates epithelial repair, thickens the corneal epithelium, promotes tear secretion, and boosts goblet cell count by up-regulating protective genes while suppressing those promoting apoptosis and oxidative stress. Coupled with its excellent biocompatibility and reduced administration frequency and treatment duration, the F-CD hydrogel emerges as a promising therapeutic approach for DED."

However, the cellular pathway for translating oxidative stress signals into Nrf2-dependent antioxidant responses remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that reactive oxygen species (ROS) function as signaling molecules in modulating Nrf2’s stability and transcriptional activity by activating the DNA damage response (DDR) signaling pathway. When activated, CHK2 phosphorylates the autophagy adaptor protein p62 at serine-349, promoting its interaction with Keap1 and disrupting the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction, thereby inhibiting Nrf2 ubiquitination–dependent degradation. In addition, CHK2 directly phosphorylates Nrf2 at serine-566/serine-577, enhancing its transcriptional activity and antioxidant capacity. Consistent with these effects,Chk2−/−mice show impaired expression of Nrf2 and its downstream antioxidant target genes, along with more severe renal tissue damage in an ROS-dependent model of renal ischemia/reperfusion injury. Our study reveals a direct mechanism linking the DDR signaling pathway to ROS-triggered Nrf2-dependent antioxidant responses, providing critical insight into cellular protection against oxidative stress–induced damage."

As hydrogen combustion and fuel cell use are emerging technologies for aircraft propulsion, we simulated individual contrails from hydrogen propulsion during the first 6 min after exhaust emission, termed the vortex phase. The ice crystal loss during that stage is crucial, as the number of ice crystals has a large impact on the further evolution of contrails into contrail cirrus and their radiative forcing. 
 In this study, we investigate the properties of young contrails formed behind hydrogen-powered aircraft, particularly compared to contrails from conventional kerosene combustion. High-resolution simulations of individual contrails are performed using the EULAG-LCM model, a large-eddy simulation model with fully coupled particle-based ice microphysics.Previous studies on early contrail evolution during the vortex phase have explored a range of meteorological and aircraft-related parameters, but they have focused on contrails with ice crystal numbers and water vapor emissions typical of kerosene combustion.This study examines the early H2-contrail evolution, starting at a state where ice crystal formation and wake vortex roll-up are complete. Two key parameters are adjusted: the emitted water vapor mass and the number of ice crystals formed during the initial stage. The emitted water vapor varies between 3.7 and 38.6 g per flight meter, depending on the fuel and aircraft type. The initial ice crystal number spans 4 orders of magnitude, from approximately 1010 to 1014 ice crystals per flight meter. Additionally, we extend our atmospheric scenarios to ambient temperatures up to 235 K, as H2 contrails can form under warmer conditions where kerosene plumes typically cannot.Our results show that vortex phase processes reduce the 4-order-of-magnitude difference in ice crystal number to 2 orders of magnitude. Moreover, relative ice crystal loss increases with increasing ambient temperatures and decreasing relative humidity levels.Finally, we extend the parameterization of ice crystal loss from a previous study to include scenarios of contrails from hydrogen propulsion systems."

N2O is a potent greenhouse gas; understanding its fluxes is essential for addressing global warming. Using a new instrument and flux chambers, we introduce a system to reliably detect low N2O fluxes and provide recommendations on chamber closure times and flux calculation methods to better quantify N2O fluxes. We encourage researchers to further investigate N2O fluxes in low-nutrient environments. 
 The atmospheric concentration of nitrous oxide (N2O) has increased significantly since 1800, mainly due to agricultural activities. However, due to their large area, nutrient-poor natural soils, including those in the (sub-) Arctic, also play a crucial role in N2O emissions and consumption. Despite their importance, these soils have been understudied, due to methodological limitations in detecting low fluxes. Our study addresses this knowledge gap by testing a fast-responding portable gas analyser (PGA; Aeris MIRA Ultra N2O/CO2) combined with manual chambers (height and diameter: 25 cm) for measuring N2O fluxes from a nutrient-poor, sub-Arctic peatland. Our results show that this setup can detect and quantify low N2O flux rates, with a mean and standard error of -0.61±0.08 µg N2O-N m-2h-1 for a 5 min closure time, as observed in our study. More than 70 % of the measured N2O fluxes exceeded the minimum detectable flux (0.027±0.0002µmolm-2h-1), which varied according to chamber closure time. Our study highlights the importance of using fast-responding analysers to measure low N2O fluxes and improve our understanding of diverse N2O flux dynamics. For nutrient-poor soils, we recommend a chamber closure time of approximately 5 min. We also found that a non-linear flux calculation model yielded better results and was broadly applicable, including cases where data were linearly distributed. Overall, our study demonstrates the potential of fast-responding analysers to improve our understanding of N2O flux dynamics in nutrient-poor soils."

Abnormal sensor behaviour was observed in wet conditions. A dry linear calibration was derived, although this was invalid below 1.2 ppb due to unstable measurements. The instrument was used to measure acetylene as a methane tracer at a landfill site. Fluxes were derived from 14 downwind transects using both raw and calibrated acetylene mole fraction, with raw measurements resulting in 8 % flux underestimation. 
 Facility-scale methane emission fluxes can be derived by comparing tracer and methane mole fraction measurements downwind of a methane emission source, where a co-located tracer gas is released at a known flux rate. Acetylene is a commonly used methane tracer due to its availability, low cost and low atmospheric background. Acetylene mole fraction can be measured using infrared gas analysers such as the cavity ring-down spectroscopy Picarro G2203. However, failure to calibrate tracer gas analysers may influence methane flux estimation, due to inaccurate raw tracer mole fraction measurements. We conducted extensive Picarro G2203 laboratory characterisation testing. Picarro G2203 acetylene measurements were calibrated by diluting a high concentration of acetylene with ambient air. The precise level of acetylene in each dilution blend was determined by diluting a high-concentration methane source in an identical way, with reliable methane mole fraction measurements used to quantify the true level of dilution. A linear calibration fit applied to raw acetylene mole fraction measured by the Picarro G2203 showed that these measurements could be corrected through direct multiplication with a calibration gain factor of 0.94. However, this specific calibration for the Picarro G2203 tested in this study is only valid from an acetylene mole fraction of 1.16 ppb, below which unstable measurements were observed. The same Picarro G2203 was used during a field study to perform 14 successful transects downwind of an active landfill site, where a point-source acetylene release was conducted at a fixed flow rate. Methane fluxes were derived by integrating the methane and acetylene mole fraction plumes, as a function of distance along the sampling road. This resulted in a ±56 % flux variability between different transects which was principally due to errors associated with the tracer release location and downwind sampling positioning. Methane fluxes were also derived using raw uncalibrated Picarro G2203 acetylene mole fraction instead of calibrated measurements, which resulted an average methane emission flux underestimation of approximately 8 % for this specific study, compared to fluxes derived using calibrated measurements. Unlike a random uncertainty, this bias represents a consistent flux underestimation that cannot be reduced by improving the field sampling methodology; the only solution is using calibrated acetylene mole fraction measurements. The magnitude of the bias is principally due to the 0.94 multiplicative gain factor. Therefore, a similar level of methane flux bias can be expected in other studies when using uncalibrated acetylene mole fraction measurements from the Picarro G2203 tested in this work. This study therefore emphasises the equal importance of calibrating target as well as tracer gas measurements, regardless of the instrument being used to obtain these measurements. Otherwise, biases can be induced within target gas flux estimates. For the example of methane, this can influence our understanding of the role of certain facility-scale sources within the global methane budget."

As our climate warms, fjords are hotspots of change and more scientists are collecting data in fjords. These data need to be available, useable, and intuitive across a wide range of users– from scientists to local people interested in their home. We provide an example of gridded data from Sermilik Fjord, Southeast Greenland as a way to achieve this. 
 As global atmosphere and ocean temperatures rise and the Greenland Ice Sheet loses mass, the glacial fjords of Kalallit Nunaat/Greenland play an increasingly critical role in our climate system. Fjords are pathways for freshwater from ice melt to reach the ocean and for deep, warm, nutrient–rich ocean waters to reach marine–terminating glaciers, supporting abundant local ecosystems that Greenlanders rely upon. Research in Greenland fjords has become more interdisciplinary and more observations are being collected in fjords than in previous decades. However, there are few long–term (> 10 years) datasets available for single fjords. Additionally, observations in fjords in general are often spatially and temporally disjointed, utilize multiple observing tools, and are rarely provided in formats that are easily used across disciplines or audiences. We address this issue by providing standardized, gridded summer season hydrographic sections for Sermilik Fjord in Southeast Greenland, from 2009–2023. Gridded data facilitate the analysis of coherent spatial patterns across the fjord domain, and are a more accessible and intuitive data product compared to discrete profiles. We combined ship–based conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) profiles with helicopter–deployed eXpendable CTD (XCTD) profiles from the ice mélange region to create objectively mapped (or optimally interpolated) along–fjord sections of conservative temperature and absolute salinity. From the gridded data, we derived a summer season climatological mean and root mean square deviation, summarizing typical fjord conditions and highlighting regions of variability. This information can be used by model and laboratory studies, fjord intercomparison studies, biological and ecosystem studies in the fjord, and provides context for interpreting previous work. All original profile observations, gridded data, and climatological products are publicly available in netCDF format at Arctic Data Center and GitHub. The code used has also been made available to facilitate continued updates to the Sermilik Fjord gridded data product and applications to other fjord systems."

This study introduces a wavelength-optimized far-UVC KrCl* lamp (UV222)/sulfite as transformative ARPs. Sulfite exhibited 45.6-fold stronger absorption at 222 nm compared with 254 nm, coupled with a higher innate quantum yield (Φinnate) of 0.128 mol·Ein–1 versus 0.115 mol·Ein–1. This wavelength optimization generated 29.2-fold higher steady-state concentration of eaq–, with optimal performance at basic pH (>9) and moderate sulfite dosages (0.4–0.75 mM). HOC degradation and dehalogenation showed clear structure-dependent patterns. The enhancive effect of UV222 over UV254 negatively correlated with HOCs’ susceptibility to UV photolysis due to competitive absorption between sulfite and target compounds. Electron-withdrawing halogens significantly favored reductive degradation over oxidation, enabling UV222/sulfite to outperform UV222/H2O2 by 1.3–37.1 times in degradation and 1.9–48.6 times in dehalogenation efficiency, with prominent enhancement particularly for polyhalogenated HOCs. In real water matrices, nitrate and nitrite inhibited HOCs’ degradation through UV absorption and eaq– scavenging. Compared with UV254/sulfite, UV222/sulfite reduced energy costs by 92.7% and required lower sulfite doses.

We compiled a comprehensive data set including 44 PFAS and 405 soils from 35 literature reports, conducted a meta-analysis, and constructed robust machine learning models. Machine learning models using LightGBM with RDKit or PaDEL descriptors achieved R2 of 0.89, 0.88, and 0.72, RMSE of 0.28, 0.28, and 0.36, and MAE of 0.18, 0.19, and 0.28 for cross-validation, internal test set, and external test set, respectively. SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) analysis identified PFAS properties as the primary influence on sorption, followed by environmental conditions and soil properties. We found that low SOC (<0.56%) minimally affects PFAS sorption. A pH of 6 is the boundary point where anionic PFAS are mainly attracted or repelled by electrostatic interaction, and higher pH may enhance the PFAS soil sorption through cation bridges. Although van der Waals forces and polar interactions enhance the sorption of PFAS with carbon chains ≥8, the introduction of polar structures containing oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur into PFAS will lower hydrophobicity and sorption affinity. This study provides accurate predictive models, which are helpful for environmental decision-making."

We investigated these associations and examined the mediating role of maternal and neonatal thyroid hormones in a Chinese birth cohort consisting of 501 mother-child pairs. We found that exposure to 2-hydroxy-benzothiazole (2-OH-BTH) in early pregnancy was inversely associated with childhood body mass index (BMI) (β = −0.041, 95% CI: −0.077, −0.005). Both tolyl-triazole (TTR) (β = −1.35%, 95% CI: −2.45%, −0.24%) and 2-OH-BTH (β = −1.15%, 95% CI: −1.79%, −0.50%) were inversely associated with maternal free thyroxine (FT4) in early pregnancy, which mediated 23.53% of the inverse associations between 2-OH-BTH exposure and childhood BMI. Additionally, third-trimester exposure to 1-hydroxy-benzotriazole, xylyl-triazole, TTR, and 2-OH-BTH was positively linked to neonatal thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. These findings suggest that prenatal exposure to BTs, particularly 2-OH-BTH, may impair early childhood growth by disrupting thyroid hormone homeostasis. Our results add new epidemiological evidence to the growing concern about BTs and underscore the importance of considering thyroid disruption as a mechanistic link between environmental exposures and developmental outcomes.

Antimony K-edge EXAFS spectroscopy reveals coprecipitation involved Sb(V) incorporation into the lepidocrocite structure via Sb(V)-for-Fe(III) substitution, whereas sorption involved edge and double-corner sharing between SbO6 and FeO6 octahedra at the lepidocrocite surface (with the proportional abundance of these linkages decreasing as Sb(V) sorption increased). Sb(V) sorption to lepidocrocite enabled faster Sb dissolution relative to Fe in 1 M HCl, whereas coprecipitation facilitated congruent dissolution of Sb and Fe. The Wenzel sequential extraction scheme substantially underestimated Sb(V) adsorption to the lepidocrocite surface, yet recovered remaining sorbed Sb(V) and all coprecipitated Sb(V) in extraction steps that target hydrous oxide-bound species. In contrast, very little sorbed or coprecipitated Sb(V) was recovered by the reducible step of the BCR sequential extraction, despite lepidocrocite being a readily reducible Fe(III) oxide. Instead, the BCR scheme incorrectly implied that lepidocrocite-bound Sb(V) was mostly oxidizable or nonreactive (i.e., bound in sulfides, organic matter, or highly stable phases such as tripuhyite). This study provides new insights into Sb(V) retention by lepidocrocite while providing useful guidance on the utility of common Sb extraction schemes."

Field measurements clearly show that concentrations of organic compounds measured in cloudwater can deviate significantly from predictions made with Henry’s law, with high enrichments measured for less water-soluble organic compounds. Several processes are suspected to be the cause of the observed enrichments, but the key process has not yet been elucidated. Here, we use the bulk-interface partitioning approach to predict enrichment coefficients (q) of organic compounds in cloud droplets. A predictive equation is derived as a function of the bulk-interface partition coefficients (Kp) and octanol–water partition coefficients (Kow). The calculated enrichments are compared to measured q values from different field campaigns. The results show that the predicted values follow the same trend and absolute values as the measurements. Highly water-soluble compounds have small enrichments, with values around 1, while less soluble compounds have very high enrichments of up to >103. A sensitivity study is performed for the range of Kow values obtained from different models, and for the range of measurements for different measurement conditions. The results of the sensitivity study show that the q measurements and predictions lie within the same range, thus showing that bulk-interface partitioning can be a good predictor for organic enrichments in cloudwater."

Here, using a meteorologically‐informed hydrologic model, we simulate the time‐evolving water budget during the nine‐AR event and identify hydrometeorological conditions that contributed to widespread landslide occurrences across California. Our analysis reveals that 89% of observed landslides occurred under excessively wet conditions, driven by precipitation exceeding the capacities of infiltration, storage, evapotranspiration, and soil drainage. Using K‐means clustering, we identify three distinct hydrometeorological pathways that increased landslide potential: intense precipitation‐induced runoff (∼32% of reported landslides), rain on pre‐wetted soils (∼53%), and snowmelt and soil ice thawing (∼15%). Our findings highlight the importance of constraining the compounding factors that influence slope stability over spatial scales consistent with landslide‐triggering weather systems."

To address this, here we present updated projections of TCs for the southwest Pacific from a high‐resolution downscaled ensemble of CMIP6 models. The downscaling implements a variable‐resolution atmospheric model enhancing resolution over the southwest Pacific and New Zealand (∼12–30 km). We assess future changes in TC frequency, changes in large‐scale environmental conditions, and associated extreme precipitation and winds across tropical and ex‐tropical storm phases. Changes in TC track pathways are also investigated through cluster analysis. Across the downscaled simulations, robust changes in TC frequency were not found, including for a high‐emissions scenario at end‐of‐century. Projections of the background environmental conditions are shown to be a significant source of uncertainty, owing to diverging projections of relative SST and tropical convection across the region in the host GCMs. However, very strong TCs (category 4 and above) show greater consensus for an increase in frequency, with 16 of 18 simulations across models and scenarios projecting an increase. Cluster analysis of TC tracks indicates a slight decrease in tracks that often impact northern parts of Australia. Extreme precipitation associated with TCs under a high‐emissions scenario is projected to increase by ∼30%–35% averaged across models, both for storms in the tropics and ex‐TCs impacting New Zealand. This increase exceeds Clausius‐Clapeyron scaling in five of six simulations.

Isotope‐incorporated General Circulation Models (GCMs) are powerful tools that account for the physical processes related to stable water isotopes. In this study, we implemented a global version of the Non‐iteration Dimensional‐split Semi‐Lagrangian (NDSL) advection scheme in the IsoGSM to address a systematic bias in the delta values of surface precipitation over the Antarctic Plateau during austral winter (June–July–August; JJA). Results indicate that the spatial distribution of delta deuterium of surface precipitation during austral summer (December–January–February; DJF) is accurately simulated by both the control experiment (CNTL) and a subsequent NDSL experiment (NDSLQ); however, during austral winter, CNTL and NDSLQ exhibit differences, particularly over East Antarctica. Notably, NDSLQ captures the temperature effect more effectively than CNTL. Analysis of precipitation systems crossing the Korean Peninsula reveals that NDSLQ produces a much more realistic distribution of water vapor than that of CNTL, impacting not only the overall upward motion throughout the troposphere but also the position and intensity of surface precipitation. Overall, we recommend using a global spectral model with the NDSL advection scheme instead of the spectral method to improve the simulation of stable water isotopes over Antarctica and weather systems at mid‐latitudes."

 Coseismic ruptures release stored elastic strain through a combination of shear displacement along localized, principal faults and distributed bulk inelastic failure of the surrounding material. How inelastic strain localizes as fault systems mature and structurally develop is less well understood owing to the difficulty of measuring the complex, near-field and high-strain regions of coseismic surface ruptures. Here we use radar and optical images to measure the near-field surface displacement field and magnitude of off-fault inelastic strain from 16 historic strike-slip earthquakes that occurred on faults with cumulative displacements and fault slip rates that span almost three orders of magnitude. We show that inelastic shear deformation does localize as fault systems mature: the magnitude of off-fault inelastic strain is largest (34–67%) for fault systems with the lowest cumulative displacements (<3 km) and then rapidly decays to values that saturate around 13–19% for the most ‘mature’ fault systems with cumulative displacements exceeding ~20 km. We find that more localized coseismic ruptures host faster ruptures, generate fewer aftershocks and occur along geometrically simpler fault networks.

 O-sulfation is a widespread modification of both endogenous and exogenous biomolecules, where the primary objective is to identify effective sulfuryl donors. In nature, 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) and p-nitrophenyl sulfate (PNPS) are efficient sulfuryl donors. However, most chemical sulfuryl donors in O-sulfation, typically require harsh conditions and have not been demonstrated in complex molecules. Here we report a biomimetic O-sulfation method that is compatible with complex natural products and pharmaceutical scaffolds. Key to this approach is the use of tetrabutylammonium (nBu4N+) as a counterion for intrinsically anionic PNPS donor. The role of nBu4N+ goes far beyond simple charge balance; the coordination of nBu4N+ with sulfate in PNPS activates the sulfuryl donor by elongating the S–O bond and enhancing the leaving ability of nitrophenolate group. This unique activation model facilitates the transfer of sulfuryl group to diverse alcohols and phenols under simple and mild reaction conditions, thereby demonstrating its utility for site-selective O-sulfation with multiple hydroxyl groups.

 Schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease, is transmitted by freshwater snails. Interruption of transmission will require novel vector-focused interventions. We performed a genome-wide association study of African snails, Biomphalaria sudanica, exposed to Schistosoma mansoni in an endemic area of high transmission in Kenya. Two snail genomic regions, SudRes1 and SudRes2, were significantly associated with snail resistance to schistosomes. SudRes1 includes receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatases while SudRes2 includes a class of leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptors, both comprising diverse extracellular binding domains suggestive of host-pathogen interaction. Resistant and susceptible haplotypes show numerous coding differences including presence/absence of entire genes. No loci previously tied to schistosome resistance in a neotropical snail species showed any association with compatibility suggesting that loci involved in the resistance of African vectors are distinct. Snail ancestry was also strongly correlated with parasite compatibility. These results will inform future efforts to predict and manipulate immunity of a major schistosome vector.

Removing DNA methylation from the fetal haemoglobin promoter effectively upregulates the gene, opening avenues for the treatment of blood disorders. 
 β-hemoglobinopathies caused by mutations in adult-expressed HBB can be treated by re-activating the adjacent paralogous genes HBG1 and HBG2 (HBG), which are normally silenced perinatally. Although HBG expression is induced by global demethylating drugs, their mechanism is poorly understood, and toxicity limits their use. We identify the DNMT1-associated maintenance methylation protein UHRF1 as a mediator of HBG repression through a CRISPR/Cas9 screen. Loss of UHRF1 in the adult-type erythroid cell line HUDEP2 causes global demethylation and HBG activation that is reversed upon localized promoter re-methylation. Conversely, targeted demethylation of the HBG promoters activates their genes in HUDEP2 or primary CD34+ cell-derived erythroblasts. Mutation of MBD2, a CpG-methylation reading component of the NuRD co-repressor complex, recapitulates the effects of promoter demethylation. Our findings demonstrate that localized CpGmethylation at the HBG promoters facilitates gene silencing and identify a potential therapeutic approach for β-hemoglobinopathies via epigenomic editing.

Bound excitons show higher efficiency, providing insights for designing advanced photocatalysts with improved performance. 
 Identifying reactive sites and measuring their activities is crucial for enhancing the efficiency of every catalyst. Reactivity maps can guide the development of next-generation photocatalysts like 2D transition metal dichalcogenides, which suffer from low conversion rates. While their electrocatalytic sites are well-studied, their photocatalytic sites remain poorly understood. Using scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy, we spatially resolve the photoreactivity of MoS2 monolayers, a prototypical 2D transition metal dichalcogenide, for redox reactions, including H2 production from water. Aligned-unaligned excitation-detection measurements reveal that photogenerated holes and electrons exhibit distinct behaviors. Oxidation products localize at the excitation spot, indicating stationary holes, while photoreduction occurs up to at least 80 microns away, showing exceptional electron mobility. We also elucidate the photochemical reactivity according to the nature of the electronic excitation, showing that the internal quantum efficiency of strongly-bound A-excitons outperforms weakly-bound (free-carrier like) C-excitons across the flake. These findings offer novel guidance to rationally design 2D photocatalysts via engineering their optical and charge extraction abilities for efficient solar energy conversion.

 Oceanic fronts often support enhanced phytoplankton biomass. Yet, how fronts influence the composition of phytoplankton communities remains poorly understood. Here, we leverage 18 years of high-resolution satellite data of sea-surface temperature and ocean color-derived pigments, converted into concentrations of seven phytoplankton groups, including diatoms, prokaryotes, and five other eukaryotic groups, to examine changes in phytoplankton community composition over fronts across oligotrophic to eutrophic conditions in the Northwest Atlantic. We found a population shift towards more diatoms and less prokaryotes at fronts, while the change in proportion of the other eukaryotic groups varies. This shift accounts for up to a half of the large-scale community dissimilarity, underscoring the substantial influence of fronts on phytoplankton community composition. Our findings suggest that fronts may serve as natural diatom refuges in a warming climate, highlighting the necessity of incorporating fine-scale oceanographic features like fronts into climate models.

 The success of industrial scale carbon capture and storage in geologic reservoirs depends on the permanence of the stored carbon dioxide (CO2). Carbon dioxide capture and mineralisation (CCM) or mineral carbonation, which is the conversion of CO2 to carbonate minerals via fluid-rock reactions provides low risk and permanent CO2 removal. Here, we demonstrate rapid mineralisation of industrial CO2 emissions in mantle peridotites. Captured CO2 from an ammonia plant in the Sultanate of Oman has been injected into peridotite at a pilot test site in the Samail ophiolite. Chemical and isotopic results indicate rapid carbonate mineral precipitation. Mass balance calculations suggest that ~88% of the injected CO2 was mineralised as carbonate minerals within 45 days after injection. This successful approach of CCM unlocks peridotite as a promising new type of reservoir for the safe and permanent disposal of anthropogenic CO2 emissions.

 Lakes are critical sentinels of climate change, yet their responses to rapid warming remain poorly understood. Here we present organic geochemical data of lacustrine sediments from eastern China during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (56 million years ago) to unravel environmental and biotic responses to rapid warming. Organic geochemical proxies indicate ≥7 °C continental warming in East Asia, triggering cascading effects including intensified stratification, bottom-water deoxygenation, eutrophication, and methanogenesis. These processes, evidenced by isotopic, productivity, and redox proxies, parallel modern lake responses to anthropogenic forcing. During the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, elevated methane emissions from lacustrine systems likely amplified warming through positive carbon-cycle feedbacks. Our findings highlight lakes as one of potential dynamic amplifiers of carbon cycle perturbations, providing critical insights into freshwater ecosystem resilience in a warming world. This deep-time perspective underscores the vulnerability of modern lakes to cascading ecological disruptions, informing models of ecosystem resilience and carbon-climate interactions under sustained warming.

 This paper shows the first demonstration of spaceborne L-band bistatic InSAR from the Chinese Lutan-1 mission for forest vertical structural information retrieval (in this work, namely, vertical profile, forest height, and underlying topography). With the single-polarization/baseline bistatic InSAR mode of Lutan-1, the measured few-look InSAR phase height histograms compare very well with the GEDI lidar waveforms, both capturing similar characteristics of the forest vertical structural profile. The ground finding approach based on the few-look InSAR phase height histogram is further adapted to incorporate spaceborne lidar measurements from GEDI and ICESat-2/ATLAS for more robust calibration. As for the DTM estimation, two ground finding strategies are developed: one using ample spaceborne lidar samples (with the lidar height as the feature), and the other using limited spaceborne lidar samples (with the few-look InSAR phase height standard deviation as the feature), both of which rely on the statistical model relating the underlying terrain elevation to the statistics of the few-look InSAR histogram. Then, forest height is inverted using the few-look histogram that mimics using lidar waveform to derive height metrics. The large-scale DTM and forest height mosaics of 2.74 million hectares are produced over tropical rainforest of the entire Hainan island of China. Through validation with airborne lidar data, the forest height is estimated to an accuracy of ∼5 m for tropical forest up to 45 m tall (relative error 10–15 %). The InSAR-derived DTM has a negligible bias (mean value of the radar-lidar DTM deviation) as referenced to airborne lidar DTM, with the uncertainties (median absolute deviation or MAD) being dependent on topographic surface slopes: 3 m (<2°), 4 m (2°-6°), 7 m (6°-25°), and 9 m (>25°). This approach sheds light on combining ascending/descending viewing geometries of spaceborne L-band bistatic InSAR data with single polarization/baseline (e.g. Lutan-1 and its follow-on) for large-scale wall-to-wall mapping of forest vertical structural profile, height metrics/biomass, underlying topography, as well as the changes of these forest parameters."

 Accurate river water level estimation is essential for effective flood monitoring and water resources management. However, traditional techniques and single satellite observations have low accuracy and resolution. In this paper, we propose a novel method to enhance river water level estimation by fusing Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) data and Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery based on advanced machine learning (ML) techniques. SAR provides high-resolution, all-weather surface imagery, while the GNSS-Reflectometry from the eight-satellite CYGNSS mission offers frequent and wide-coverage observations. Dynamic river water levels are obtained at a daily temporal resolution by extracting changes in Sentinel-1 backscattering coefficients and integrating them with the CYGNSS data's high temporal resolution feature. To guarantee the model's robustness, a ten-fold cross-validation (CV) procedure is used with incorporating 15 uniformly distributed gauge sites. Experimental results show that the data fusion method significantly improved the temporal resolution, and more importantly the precision of water level estimation. As opposed to the model without data fusion, the optimized fusion algorithm achieved a 50.74 % reduction in RMSE from 0.341 to 0.168 m, while the R was improved from 0.876 to 0.936. An improvement of over 35 % in RMSE was observed at 8 out of 15 stations. To further validate the model's generalizability, we tested it using data from 8 spatially and temporally independent hydrological stations. The fusion method reduced the RMSE from 0.479 to 0.202 m and increased the R from 0.848 to 0.927, further confirming its effectiveness in enhancing water level estimation. The findings indicate that integrating SAR imagery and CYGNSS time series data has complementary effects and enables better water level estimation."

 Permafrost degradation has been recognized for decades due to climate warming, wildfire, and infrastructure development. However, a large-scale characterization of permafrost thaw status has not been attempted before due to difficulties in ground data collection, inherent complications and heterogeneity of thaw in ecosystem-protected permafrost, and constraints of remote sensor observations and process-based modeling techniques. Here we made a first effort to map the status of permafrost thaw across a large ice-rich lowland fire-influenced landscape (2500 km2) in interior Alaska by developing a new protocol and combining decades of field measurements, repeat airborne lidar, spaceborne WorldView-2, Sentinel-2, Landsat time series products, and a terrain elevation dataset. The repeat lidar and fine-resolution imagery offered a key to solving the bottleneck issue of thaw reference data collection, which further provided an opportunity to track post-fire thaw caused by six large fires in the past 25 years in four stages over time: old thaw, lateral thaw, vertical shallow thaw and vertical deep thaw. The developed protocol achieved an overall accuracy of 79 % in classifying these thaw stages and generated a reasonable thaw pattern mainly controlled by fires and locally modified by other drivers. Identifying degradation patterns can help understand the permafrost-fire-climate system. The protocol is a valuable alternative to current thermokarst mapping techniques."

 Vegetation leaf area index (LAI) data with continuous spatio-temporal coverage are crucial for monitoring vegetation growth, predicting crop yields, and studying global environmental changes. However, due to limitations of recent satellite observations and retrieval algorithms, the prevailing operational LAI product is of low spatial resolution, which is insufficient to support fine-scale detection of land surface vegetation changes. To overcome these challenges, a novel data assimilation approach, the ENKF-NDVI (Ensemble Kalman Filter-NDVI) model, was developed to estimate LAI data with 10-m spatial and 5-day temporal resolution. Time-series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data with 30-m spatial and 5-day temporal resolution were used instead of 500-m resolution LAI data to depict vegetation change trends and solve the patch effects caused by the scale differences.

Validation with ground-based measurements indicates a high accuracy with R2 of 0.85 and RMSE of 0.39.

The results show that Shenzhen's PM2.5 levels declined by 47 % from 2014 to 2024, mostly due to long-term emission cuts, with meteorological impacts accounting for a minor 11.9 % of the change. Urban PM2.5 concentrations consistently surpass suburban ones, with both experiencing approximately 30 % declines in Phase I (2014–2019), whereas in Phase II (2019–2024), the urban site shows a greater 29 % drop compared with a 17 % drop at the suburban site, narrowing their gap. The source apportionment results show that in Phase I, the urban site's PM2.5 decline stemmed mainly from reduced vehicle emissions and secondary sulfate, while the suburban site's drop resulted from decreased secondary sulfate, ship emissions, and secondary organic aerosols. In Phase II, fugitive dust reduction is the primary driver of PM2.5 declines at both sites, though other sources also play a contributing role. Emission reductions from sources in Phase II are smaller than those in Phase I, coupled with a narrowed concentration gap between the two sites and a rising relative contribution from secondary sources, highlighting Shenzhen's need for stronger regional coordination and secondary pollutant control to lower PM2.5 levels."

 This study examines the modeling uncertainty of wind resource data stemming from the use of various planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterizations available in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. WRF-based wind simulations spanning 20 years at 3-km resolution using 11 different PBL schemes are used to objectively investigate the uncertainty in modeling wind speed for land-based wind (LBW) and offshore wind (OSW) locations in Puerto Rico. The uncertainty in the wind modeling for the 20-year dataset is quantified using the spread index (SI) and standard deviation (SD). For virtual LBW and OSW sites, the SI and SD values are analyzed as calculated across various spatial and temporal scales. Because the PBL's atmospheric stability conditions can be characterized into two dominant categories, the study focuses on analyzing the SI and SD for daytime (mainly unstable PBL conditions) and nighttime (mainly stable PBL conditions). For wind shear (10 m–200 m) at the OSW and LBW sites, WRF-based numerical experiments indicate the following SI (or SD) ranges: 39 %–94 % (0.74 m/s–1.44 m/s) during the daytime for OSW, 50 %–75 % (0.68 m/s–1.19 m/s) during the daytime for LBW, 37 %–60 % (0.73 m/s–1.12 m/s) during the nighttime for OSW, and 57 %–143 % (0.65 m/s–1.43 m/s) during the nighttime for LBW.

 The Yangtze River Delta region (YRD) is one of the most important regions with rapid urbanization in China. The research employs the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) to investigate the influences of urbanization on precipitation patterns and intensities of predecessor rain events (PREs) induced by Typhoon Khanun (2017) in the YRD. The results indicate that using land use data during the precipitation event can improve the model simulation performance. Although the total regional precipitation remains relatively unchanged, urbanization significantly alters the spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall, resulting in enhanced precipitation in the coastal urban regions near the heavy precipitation center regions, with a maximum increase up to 52 %. In contrast, rainfall near the inland outer region of the heavy precipitation center is reduced, with a maximum decrease up to 50 %, exhibiting a prominently uneven distribution pattern, which requires adaptive zoning in flood management. Mechanistically, around the coastal urban regions near heavy precipitation centers, urbanization enhances water vapor convergence and atmospheric instability, necessitating revised stormwater infrastructure design standards for these high-risk zones; while it suppresses water vapor transport, enhancing atmospheric stability in the inland outer region. Further analysis of the cloud microphysics reveals that urbanization significantly strengthens the processes of raindrop accretion of cloud water and water vapor condensing into raindrops, thereby promoting increased rainfall in the coastal urban region; in contrast, it may weaken the processes of snow melting and water vapor condensing into raindrops, leading to reduced precipitation in the peripheral inland outer region. These findings offer scientific support for climate-resilient urban planning, demonstrating how urbanization shifts precipitation patterns, necessitating coordinated regional adaptation for flood resilience."

 Polar regions exhibit distinctive irradiance characteristics driven by their high-latitude location, yet these features have been scarcely investigated. In this study, we present and analyze surface irradiance measurements from two sites around Longyearbyen (78.2° N) in Svalbard: Adventdalen valley and Platåberget (456 m above sea level). The Adventdalen measurements span 10 years (2013−2022) of longwave (LW) and shortwave (SW) horizontal irradiance, while SW irradiance measurements, both horizontal and tilted, cover the sunlight seasons of 2021 and 2022 at both sites. Key findings include unique irradiance features, such as downwelling SW irradiance is maximum in late May—earlier than the solstice—due to a relative low cloudiness and the snow involving an irradiance enhancement (terrain reflection and albedo enhancement). Upwelling SW irradiance, influenced by snow cover, peaks in early May but may shift with prolonged snow seasons. Albedo values from May 2012–2017 were lower than 2018–2022, suggesting earlier snowmelt and potential long-term impacts on upwelling SW irradiance. Comparatively, SW irradiance is generally higher on Platåberget, with snow cover differences leading to discrepancies in downwelling and upwelling SW irradiance, in part due to an irradiance enhancement with high albedo. The LW budget is consistently negative, averaging −34 W m−2 annually, while the SW budget drives the surface energy balance, becoming positive from late April to mid-September. These findings underscore the importance of in-situ measurements for understanding Arctic irradiance processes, which are crucial for advancing solar energy applications and climate research in polar regions."

 Extreme precipitation plays a critical role in the development of hydrological extremes with severe socio-economic and environmental impacts. Over the Tibetan Plateau (TP), extreme precipitation events have increased in frequency and intensity and are projected to rise further under climate change. However, simulations of such events in this region remain challenging due to uncertainties in the representation of cloud microphysics. While previous research has exposed the sensitivity of climate models to microphysics schemes, the atmospheric processes driving discrepancies in precipitation simulations are still not fully explored. In this study, we analyse two extreme precipitation events over the TP region using six different microphysics schemes in the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF). We assess how precipitation and related processes are represented across these schemes and identify key sources of uncertainties in precipitation simulations. Our findings reveal substantial variations in the location, intensity and timing of precipitation, with differences in accumulated amounts reaching up to 40 % depending on the microphysics scheme used. Further analysis shows that the timing and strength of convective activity are closely linked to precipitation patterns, leading to significant discrepancies across experiments. Additionally, the representation of horizontal water vapour transport plays a critical role in determining the location and intensity of precipitation by influencing moisture availability. Lastly, the modelling of cloud composition – particularly of solid-phase hydrometeors – emerges as a crucial factor in precipitation evolution, contributing substantially to the variability in simulated precipitation location and intensity."

 The present study characterizes the pre-monsoon convective clouds (PMCC) observed in the monsoon core zone and a hail-producing storm during the pre-monsoon month observed using C-band dual-polarization (CDPR) radar at the IITM's Atmospheric Research Testbed (ART) facility in Silkheda, 60 km north of Bhopal. The composite analysis of PMCC has shown that the maximum height of 35- and 50-dBZ echo tops (ETHs) is around 13 km and 11 km, respectively, indicating intense and deep convection. The mean value of Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) is also high for the pre-monsoon season. The composite contoured-frequency-by-altitude diagrams (CFADs) of PMCC show a high frequency of smaller values of differential reflectivity (ZDR ∼ 0 dB) and specific differential phase (KDP) above the melting layer, indicating that intense convective updrafts dominate the PMCC, causing hail/graupel particles to be rimmed heavily above the melting layer and reach greater heights. The wider distribution or higher values of ZH, ZDR, KDP, and small values of correlation coefficient ρHV (<0.95) near the surface indicate the presence of a rain-hail mixture during the pre-monsoon month.The microphysical characteristic of a hailstorm event that produced hailstones over Bhopal on 30th April 2023 is explored. It is found that the CAPE value was building up before the hailstorm event, and it was high just before the hailstone was observed over Bhopal. Time evolution of storms indicates the dominant presence of graupel/hail at 5-11 km. Graupel/hail will form due to the riming or accretion processes of cloud droplets, supercooled water, or ice particles. It has been observed that the riming process is dominant during the storm's evolution, which produces very low values of ZDR and KDP. The high value of ρHV (>0.99) at these altitudes suggests that the graupel/hail is dry. The updraft associated with a convectively unstable atmosphere exaggerates the growth of ice crystals by a rapid collection of supercooled water droplets. That ultimately led to forming graupel/hailstones through the riming process. The wet hailstones and large raindrops signatures close to the surface are also observed and are characterized by higher values of ZH (> 50 dBZ), enhanced ZDR (∼ 3–4 dB), and a depleted ρHV (< 0.95). Additionally, a KDP exceeding 1.8°/km near the surface indicates the process of hail melting/hail coated with water."

Based on the observational data in Beijing, we investigated the characteristics and potential physical mechanisms of turbulent non‐stationarity in a megacity area. The results show that the proportion of non‐stationary turbulence in Beijing reached 52.41% in 2017. Strongly non‐stationary turbulence mainly occurs under strongly‐stable/strongly‐unstable stratification conditions. Strong non‐stationarity reduces the turbulent transport efficiency. This is characterized by the disintegration of turbulent coherent structures and the dominance of submeso motions. Furthermore, it was found that submeso motions (e.g., internal gravity waves and convective circulations) are the main cause of non‐stationary turbulence. After removing the influence of submeso motions based on the Hilbert‐Huang transform, the non‐stationary level is effectively reduced. The results are significant for accurately estimating turbulent fluxes and improving the parameterization of turbulent exchange processes in megacity areas."

Here, we provide a new statistical learning‐based method to quantify the forced and internal variability contributions to annual GMST based on CMIP6‐simulated surface temperatures, producing a variability‐adjusted GMST time series. We find a variability contribution to 2023 GMST of 0.1 K, with strong contributions from the El Niño Southern Oscillation region and North Atlantic. More than half of the 2022–2023 jump in temperature is explained by variability, largely owing to anomalously cool conditions in 2022. We find insufficient evidence of an abrupt increase in forced warming rate in recent years. Our results highlight the importance of variability originating outside the tropical Pacific and the need to filter out unforced variability when assessing changes in long‐term warming rates."

Parameters most significant to simulated albedo symmetry impact precipitation, turbulent dissipation, and sea salt aerosol emissions. Constraining the PPE's shortwave cloud feedbacks using the observed albedo symmetry yields a range of +0.61 ± $\pm $ 0.24 W m−2 K−1 (66% confidence), which is stronger than that of the model's control simulation due to parameter settings that lead to greater loss of subtropical low clouds and weaker negative cloud phase feedback.

 Climate models exhibit substantial inter-model spread in climate sensitivity, typically attributed to uncertainty in cloud feedbacks. In contrast, the influence of clear-sky shortwave absorption (SWA) remains underexplored, despite its substantial uncertainty. Using a single-model framework, we systematically perturb SWA and impose CO₂ quadrupling on distinct mean states that differ in SWA, allowing assessment of its impact on both the mean climate and the CO₂-driven response. Enhanced SWA reduces surface shortwave radiation, leading to Arctic cooling. Under higher SWA, CO₂ forcing drives increased advection of colder Arctic air into the subpolar North Atlantic, enhancing turbulent heat loss and facilitating AMOC recovery. This accelerated recovery amplifies warming in the subpolar North Atlantic, strengthens lapse rate and shortwave cloud feedbacks, and ultimately increases climate sensitivity over time. These findings reveal a previously overlooked pathway by which clear-sky SWA modulates long-term climate feedback, underscoring the need to better constrain SWA in climate models."

 Remote detection of plastic litter in both marine and freshwater environments using satellite measurements has become a hot research topic in the past decade, where numerous papers have shown “successful” algorithm development and applications. However, many of these results appear to need some revisits because, in logic, the causality of A to B (i.e., A  => B) does not lead to the inference of B => A unless A is the only reason to cause B. In practice, even though plastics can lead to a certain type of signal anomaly (e.g., spectral, spatial, backscattering) from controlled experiments, the same anomaly detected from the natural environments cannot be used to infer plastics unless other possible reasons can all be ruled out. This is especially true when considering that non-plastic floating matters are much more ubiquitous in the aquatic environments. Unfortunately, this logic has been missing in many, if not most, publications. Here, using spectral reflectances of various types of floating matters and through demonstrations of several examples, I show why such logic is critical in remote detection of plastic litter and why pixel averaging and subtraction are necessary steps to spectrally discriminate the signal anomaly in multi-band optical remote sensing imagery. It is argued that unless other possibilities are ruled out using imaging spectroscopy or other means, it is premature to attribute the detected signal anomaly to plastic litter. After all, not every anomaly pixel is necessarily due to litter, and not every litter pixel is necessarily due to plastics unless proven otherwise."
