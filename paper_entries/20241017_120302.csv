The inventory is validated by a modeling study against the observations. This study enhances the understanding of anthropogenic chlorine emissions in the atmosphere, identifies key sources, and provides scientific support for pollution control and climate change. 
 Chlorine species play a crucial role as precursors to Cl radicals, which can significantly impact the atmospheric oxidation capacity and influence the levels of trace gases related to climate and air quality. Several studies have established a chlorine emission inventory in China in recent years, but the emission remains uncertain and requires further investigation. The Anthropogenic Chlorine Emission Inventory for China (ACEIC) was the first chlorine emission inventory for China based on local data developed in our previous study, which only includes the emissions from coal combustion and waste incineration. In this study, we updated this inventory to include data for a more recent year (2019) and expanded the range of species considered (HCl, fine particulate Cl−, Cl2, and hypochlorous acid (HOCl)) and the number of anthropogenic sources (41 specific sources). Compared with previous studies, this updated inventory considered more anthropogenic sources, used more localized emission factors, and adopted more refined estimation methods. The total emissions of HCl, fine particulate Cl−, Cl2, and HOCl in mainland China for the year 2019 were estimated to be 361 (−18 % to 27 %), 174 (−27 % to 59 %), 18 (−10 % to  15 %), and 79 (−12 % to 18 %) Gg, respectively. To facilitate analysis, we aggregated the chlorine emissions from various sources into five economic sectors: power, industry, residential, agriculture, and biomass burning. HCl emissions were primarily derived from the industry (43 %), biomass burning (38 %), and residential (13 %) sectors. The biomass burning and industry sectors accounted for 74 % and 19 % of the fine particulate Cl− emissions, respectively. Residential and industry sectors contributed 61 % and 29 % of the total Cl2 emissions. HOCl emissions were predominantly from the residential sector, constituting 90 % of the total emissions. Notably, the usage of chlorine-containing disinfectants was identified as the most significant source of Cl2 and HOCl emissions in the residential sector. Geographically, regions with high HCl and fine particulate Cl− emissions were found in the North China Plain, northeastern China, central China, and the Yangtze River Delta, whereas the Pearl River Delta, Yangtze River Delta, and Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei regions exhibited elevated levels of Cl2 and HOCl emissions. Regarding monthly variation, emissions of HCl and fine particulate Cl− were higher during early spring (February to April) and winter (December to January) due to intensified agricultural activities, while Cl2 and HOCl emissions were higher in the summer months due to increased demand for water disinfection. We incorporated this emission inventory into the chemical transport model and found the simulated concentrations of chlorine species agreed reasonably well with the observations, which suggested the relatively faithful estimations of their emissions. This updated inventory contributes to a better understanding of anthropogenic sources of chlorine species and can aid in the formulation of emission control strategies to mitigate secondary pollution in China."
10.5194/acp-24-11585-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇研究论文主要关注的是印度锡金地区Gangtok的空气污染，特别是黑碳（BC）和棕碳（BrC）的浓度变化及其与气象条件之间的关系。研究通过地面监测的方法，对2021年和2022年的BC和BrC浓度进行了测量，并分析了其与地表气压、风速和降水等气象要素的相关性。结果表明，BC和BrC的浓度在旱季较高，雨季较低，这与气象条件密切相关。高气压条件下，边界层稳定，污染物不易扩散；而风速越大，污染物扩散越快。降水对污染物的清除作用显著。研究还分析了不同来源的BC（例如化石燃料燃烧和生物质燃烧）的浓度变化。总的来说，该研究利用地面观测数据，探讨了特定区域空气污染物的时空变化特征及其与气象条件的相互作用，属于大气环境地面监测范畴，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大，虽然研究结果可以为遥感反演提供地面验证数据。,"['Black carbon', 'Brown carbon', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Meteorological conditions', 'Ground-based measurements', 'Atmospheric composition', 'Aerosols']",Pramod Kumar;Khushboo Sharma;Ankita Malu;Rajeev Rajak;Aparna Gupta;Bidyutjyoti Baruah;Shailesh Yadav;Thupstan Angchuk;Jayant Sharma;Rakesh Kumar Ranjan;Anil Kumar Misra;Nishchal Wanjari,"Measurement report: Intra-annual variability of black carbon and brown carbon and their interrelation with meteorological conditions over Gangtok, Sikkim","This work monitors and assesses air pollution, especially black and brown carbon, its controlling factor, and its effect on the environment of Sikkim Himalayan region. The huge urban sprawl in recent decades has led to regional human-induced air pollution in the region. Black carbon was highest in April 2021 and March 2022, exceeding the WHO limit. The monsoon season causes huge rainfall over the region, which reduces the pollutants by scavenging (rainout and washout). 
 Black carbon (BC) and brown carbon (BrC) both have a versatile nature, and they have an apparent role in climate variability and changes. As anthropogenic activity is surging, BC and BrC are also reportedly increasing. So, the monitoring of BC and BrC and observations of land use land cover change (LULCC) at a regional level are necessary for the changes in various interconnected meteorological phenomena. The current study investigates BC, BrC, CO2, BC from fossil fuels (BCff), BC from biomass burning (BCbb), and LULCC and their relationship to the corresponding meteorological conditions over Gangtok in the Sikkim Himalayan region. The concentration of BC (BrC) was found to be highest during March 2022 (April 2021) at 43.5 µg m−3 (32.0 µg m−3). Surface pressure exhibits a significant positive correlation with BC, BCff, BCbb, and BrC. Higher surface pressure results in a calmer and more stable boundary layer, which effectively retains deposited contaminants. Conversely, the wind appears to facilitate the dispersion of pollutants, showing a strong negative correlation. The fact that all pollutants and precipitation have been shown to behave similarly points to moist scavenging of the pollutants. Despite the dense cloud cover, it is clear that the area is not receiving convective precipitation, implying that orographic precipitation is occurring over the region. Most of Sikkim receives convective rain from May to September, indicating that the region has significant convective activity contributed from the Bay of Bengal during the monsoon season. Furthermore, monsoon months have the lowest concentrations of BC, BCbb, BCff, and BrC, suggesting the potential of convective rain (as rainout scavenging) to remove most of the pollutants."
10.5194/acp-24-11565-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了全球范围内PM2.5与气溶胶光学厚度(AOD)之间关系(η)的时空变化及其驱动因素。研究发现，η的地域差异主要受气溶胶成分和垂直分布的影响。文章利用6870个地面PM2.5监测点数据和卫星反演的AOD数据，结合GEOS-Chem全球化学传输模型，定量分析了全球和区域尺度上的η值，发现其在不同地区差异显著，例如非洲地区η值远高于北美地区。高η值出现在干旱地区（气溶胶吸湿性较低）以及受地表气溶胶源影响较大的地区，低η值则出现在远离强气溶胶源的地区。进一步分析表明，气溶胶成分和垂直分布是影响η空间变异性的关键因素，通过敏感性实验量化了这两种因素的影响，结果显示气溶胶成分和垂直分布分别导致了η的总体平均值变化12.3 µg m−3和8.4 µg m−3。该研究对改进全球PM2.5估算方法，提高空气质量监测精度具有重要意义，体现了大气环境遥感技术在环境监测中的应用。,"['PM2.5', 'Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD)', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'Aerosol composition', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Global spatial variation', 'Aerosol vertical profiles', 'GEOS-Chem']",Haihui Zhu;Randall V.

Oxford;Xuan Liu;Yanshun Li;Dandan Zhang;Inderjeet Singh;Alexei Lyapustin,Importance of aerosol composition and  aerosol vertical profiles in global spatial  variation in the relationship between  PM2.5 and aerosol optical depth,"Ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) contributes to 4 million deaths globally each year. Satellite remote sensing of aerosol optical depth (AOD), coupled with a simulated PM2.5–AOD relationship (η), can provide global PM2.5 estimations. This study aims to understand the spatial patterns and driving factors of η to guide future measurement and modeling efforts. We quantified η globally and regionally and found that its spatial variation is strongly influenced by aerosol composition. 
 Ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is the leading global environmental determinant of mortality. However, large gaps exist in ground-based PM2.5 monitoring. Satellite remote sensing of aerosol optical depth (AOD) offers information to help fill these gaps worldwide when augmented with a modeled PM2.5–AOD relationship. This study aims to understand the spatial pattern and driving factors of this relationship by examining η (PM2.5AOD) using both observations and modeling. A global observational estimate of η for the year 2019 is inferred from 6870 ground-based PM2.5 measurement sites and satellite-retrieved AOD. The global chemical transport model GEOS-Chem, in its high-performance configuration (GCHP), is used to interpret the observed spatial pattern of annual mean η. Measurements and the GCHP simulation consistently identify a global population-weighted mean η value of 96–98 µg m−3, with regional values ranging from 59.8 µg m−3 in North America to more than 190 µg m−3 in Africa. The highest η value is found in arid regions, where aerosols are less hygroscopic due to mineral dust, followed by regions strongly influenced by surface aerosol sources. Relatively low η values are found over regions distant from strong aerosol sources. The spatial correlation of observed η values with meteorological fields, aerosol vertical profiles, and aerosol chemical composition reveals that spatial variation in η is strongly influenced by aerosol composition and aerosol vertical profiles. Sensitivity tests with globally uniform parameters quantify the effects of aerosol composition and aerosol vertical profiles on spatial variability in η, exhibiting a population-weighted mean difference in aerosol composition of 12.3 µg m−3, which reflects the determinant effects of composition on aerosol hygroscopicity and aerosol optical properties, and a population-weighted mean difference in the aerosol vertical profile of 8.4 µg m−3, which reflects spatial variation in the column–surface relationship."
10.5194/acp-24-11497-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了南美洲北部阿布拉谷地区PM2.5的浓度及其化学成分，重点关注远距离传输（LRT）污染物的影响。研究发现生物质燃烧、沙尘和火山喷发等外部来源会增加PM2.5浓度，并恶化其化学成分，例如增加重金属含量。研究利用正矩阵分解（PMF）模型量化了不同LRT事件类型对PM2.5浓度和化学成分的影响，并确定了主要的污染物来源，例如奥里诺科河和马格达莱纳河谷的生物质燃烧，以及内华多·德尔鲁伊斯火山的火山气溶胶。研究结果强调了远距离传输污染物对该地区空气质量的显著影响，并为未来的化学传输模型研究和污染控制策略提供了依据。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它涉及空气质量监测、大气成分分析以及对卫星观测数据的潜在应用，以追踪和量化远距离传输的污染物。,"['PM2.5', 'Air quality', 'Aerosol', 'Long-range transport', 'Biomass burning', 'Dust', 'Volcanic emission', 'Heavy metals', 'Satellite observation', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Atmospheric composition analysis']",Maria P. Velásquez-García;K. Santiago Hernández;James A. Vergara-Correa;Richard J. Pope;Miriam Gómez-Marín;Angela M. Rendón,Long-range transport of air pollutants increases the concentration of hazardous components of PM2.5 in northern South America,"In the Aburrá Valley, northern South America, local emissions determine air quality conditions. However, we found that external sources, such as regional fires, Saharan dust, and volcanic emissions, increase particulate concentrations and worsen chemical composition by introducing elements like heavy metals. Dry winds and source variability contribute to seasonal influences on these events. This study assesses the air quality risks posed by such events, which can affect broad regions worldwide. 
 Long-range transport (LRT) of air pollutants from a range of sources can substantially enhance background pollution levels, especially in urbanized regions, which can exacerbate high-pollution episodes. In the Aburrá Valley (AV), Colombia, and other cities in northern South America, biomass burning (BB), dust, and volcanic degassing have been identified as sources of long-range aerosol transport. However, the impact of these sources on air quality and the characterization of these sources have yet to be thoroughly studied. This work investigates the influence of these sources on the chemical composition of PM2.5 during annual and intra-annual high-load aerosol events in the AV. We identified, tracked, and meteorologically characterized LRT events and evaluated their influence on PM2.5 concentration and chemical composition. We found that the LRT of aerosols from BB, dust, and volcanic degassing influenced approximately 13 %, 8 %, and 13 % of days in the year, respectively. We applied the positive-matrix-factorization (PMF) statistical model to quantify PM2.5 concentrations and chemical compositions for the different LRT event types (e.g., BB). For BB events, we identified large contributions from organic carbon (OC1 and OC2), F−, and secondary aerosol tracers (SO42- and NO3-). For dust LRT events, crustal mineral components, along with Ti and Ca, were the primary contributors to aerosol composition, while SO42-, Na, Al, and Ca were the primary contributors during volcanic events. The concentrations of some ions and toxic heavy metals (Cr, Mn, Cd, and Ni) were also elevated during BB and volcanic-degassing events. BB contributed the most to PM2.5 levels during the LRT events (∼11 µg m−3), while contributions from aerosols arising from dust and volcanic events were also substantial (<7 µg m−3). Our study identifies the Orinoco and the Middle Magdalena Valley as sizable sources of BB aerosols and Nevado del Ruiz as a source of volcanic aerosols. Additionally, we found that African dust reached the Andean region via the Caribbean route. As a result, we identify the need for future chemical-transport modeling studies in the region and new support strategies to manage internal and external pollution sources that degrade air quality in the AV and the surrounding region."
10.5194/acp-24-11545-2024,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究的是甲烷和其他前体物减排对欧洲地面臭氧的影响。它使用欧洲监测与评估方案（EMEP）气象综合中心-西（MSC-W）模型，通过情景分析的方法，评估了不同减排方案（包括现有法规、最大可行技术减排和结合饮食变化的低排放方案）对2050年欧洲地区地面臭氧浓度的影响。研究结果表明，甲烷减排对降低地面臭氧浓度有显著贡献，并且甲烷减排的益处不仅仅体现在空气质量改善方面，还能显著减少全球变暖。虽然研究涉及大气成分（臭氧和甲烷）以及排放，但它主要关注的是化学传输模型模拟和情景分析，并没有直接使用大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等。因此，它与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强。,"['surface ozone', 'methane', 'air pollution', 'emission reduction', 'chemistry-transport model', 'scenario analysis']",Willem E. van Caspel;Zbigniew Klimont;Chris Heyes;Hilde Fagerli,Impact of methane and other precursor emission reductions on surface ozone in Europe: scenario analysis using the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) Meteorological Synthesizing Centre – West (MSC-W) model,"Methane in the atmosphere contributes to the production of ozone gas – an air pollutant and greenhouse gas. Our results highlight that simultaneous reductions in methane emissions help avoid offsetting the air pollution benefits already achieved by the already-approved precursor emission reductions by 2050 in the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme region, while also playing an important role in bringing air pollution further down towards World Health Organization guideline limits. 
 The impacts of future methane (CH4) and other precursor emission changes are investigated for surface ozone (O3) in the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) region excluding North America and Israel (the EMEP region, for European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme) for the year 2050. The analysis includes a current legislation (CLE) and maximum feasible technical reduction (MFR) scenario, as well as a scenario that combines MFRs with an additional dietary shift that also meets the Paris Agreement objectives with respect to greenhouse gas emissions (LOW). For each scenario, background CH4 concentrations are calculated using a probabilistic Earth system model emulator and combined with other precursor emissions in a three-dimensional Eulerian chemistry-transport model. While focus is placed on peak season maximum daily 8 h average (MDA8) O3 concentrations, a range of other indicators for health and vegetation impacts are also discussed. Our analysis shows that roughly one-third of the total peak season MDA8 reduction achieved between the 2050 CLE and MFR scenarios is attributable to CH4 reductions, resulting predominantly from CH4 emission reductions outside of the EMEP region. The impact of other precursor emission reductions is split nearly evenly between the reductions inside and outside of the EMEP region. However, the relative importance of CH4 and other precursor emission reductions is shown to depend on the choice of O3 indicator, though indicators sensitive to peak O3 show generally consistent results. The analysis also highlights the synergistic impacts of CH4 mitigation as reducing solely CH4 achieves, beyond air quality improvement, nearly two-thirds of the total global warming reduction calculated for the LOW scenario compared to the CLE case."

The findings are helpful for inlet users and are expected to aid in developing improved inlets. 
 Chemical ionisation inlets are fundamental instrument components in chemical ionisation mass spectrometry (CIMS). However, the sample gas and reagent ion trajectories are often understood only in a general and qualitative manner. Here, we evaluate two atmospheric pressure interface chemical ionisation inlets (MION2 and Eisele type inlet) with 3D computational fluid dynamics physicochemical models regarding the reagent ion and sample gas trajectories and estimate their efficiencies of reagent ion production, reagent ion delivery from the ion source volume into the ion–molecule mixing region, and the interaction between reagent ions and target molecules. The models are validated by laboratory measurements and quantitatively reproduce observed sensitivities to tuning parameters, including ion currents and changes in mass spectra. The study elucidates how the different transport and chemical reactions proceed within the studied inlets, where space charge can already be relevant at ion concentrations as low as 107 cm−3, and compares the two investigated inlet models. The models provide insights into how to operate the inlets and will help in the development of future inlets that further enhance the capability of CIMS."

 Ground level ozone (O3) is a highly oxidising gas with very reactive properties, harmful at high levels, generated by complex photochemical reactions when ""primary"" pollutants from combustion of fossil materials react with sunlight. Thus, its concentration serves as an indicator of the activity of other air pollutants and plays a key role in Air Quality monitoring systems in smart cities. To increase its spatial sampling resolution over the city map, ozone low cost sensors are an interesting alternative, but they have a lack of accuracy. In this context, artificial intelligence techniques, in particular ensemble machine learning methods, can improve the raw readings from these sensors taking into account additional environmental information. In this paper, we analyse, propose and compare different techniques, reducing the estimation error in around 94 %, achieving the best results using the Gradient Boosting algorithm and outperforming the related work using sensor approximately 10 times less expensive."

However, knowledge on the actual distribution of humidity concentrations is sparse – mainly due to technological limitations. With the herein presented lidar, it is possible to measure humidity concentrations and their vertical fluxes up to altitudes of >3 km with high spatio-temporal resolution, opening new possibilities for detailed process understanding and, ultimately, better model representation. 
 High-resolution measurements of water vapor concentrations and their transport throughout the turbulent planetary boundary layer (PBL) and beyond are key for an enhanced understanding of atmospheric processes. Therefore, data from the mobile atmospheric monitoring system (ATMONSYS) differential absorption lidar (DIAL) is presented for the first time. The ATMONSYS DIAL has been developed with the goal of resolving turbulence throughout the PBL at a sampling frequency of 10 s and vertical resolutions of less than 200 m. General measuring capabilities during high-noon, clear-sky, summer conditions with a maximum vertical measurement range of >3 km and statistical uncertainties of <5 % are demonstrated. The analysis of turbulence spectra shows an overall good agreement with Kolmogorov's law, demonstrating its general capability of resolving turbulence, although deviations to the Kolmogorov behaviour can be observed at certain frequency ranges. By the combination of the ATMONSYS DIAL with an adjacent high-quality Doppler wind lidar, some of those deviations are evaded in the co-spectra due to independent noise of both instruments. However, the intermediate deviations from the expected Kolmogorov behavior in the co-spectra persist. Under consideration of the surrounding landscape, an impact of present surface heterogeneities on those intermediate frequency deviations seems plausible. Agreement of the co-spectra with Kolmogorov's law at the highest frequencies reveals that the ATMONSYS DIAL is capable to resolve turbulent latent energy fluxes down to the measurement's Nyquist frequency of 5 · 10-2 Hz. A system cross-intercomparison of the ATMONSYS DIAL with two adjacent water vapor Raman lidars and radiosondes shows good agreement between all sensors, despite minor DIAL deficiencies under certain conditions with shreded clouds surpassing the lidar. Observed profile-to-profile DIAL fluctuations and sensor-to-sensor deviations, in combination with low statistical uncertainty, show the advantage of humidity lidars, such as the ATMONSYS DIAL, to capture both short-term and small-scale dynamics of the lowermost atmosphere."

Then, uneven spatial distribution and population exposure risks as well as increased temporal trend of UV radiation were found in China. The long-term and high-quality UV dataset could further facilitate health-related research in the future. 
 Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is closely related to health; however, limited measurements have hindered further investigation of its health effects in China. Machine learning algorithms have been widely used to predict environmental factors with high accuracy, but a limited number of studies have implemented it for UV radiation. The main aim of this study is to develop a UV radiation prediction model using the random forest approach and predict the UV radiation with a daily and 10 km resolution in mainland China from 2005 to 2020. The model was developed with multiple predictors, such as UV radiation data from satellites as independent variables and ground UV radiation measurements from monitoring stations as the dependent variable. Missing satellite-based UV radiation data were obtained using the 3 d moving average method. The model performance was evaluated using multiple cross-validation (CV) methods. The overall R2 and root mean square error between measured and predicted UV radiation from model development and model 10-fold CV were 0.97 and 15.64 W m−2 and 0.83 and 37.44 W m−2 at the daily level, respectively. The model that incorporated erythemal daily dose (EDD) retrieved from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) had a higher prediction accuracy than that without it. Based on predictions of UV radiation at the daily level, 10 km spatial resolution, and nearly 100 % spatiotemporal coverage, we found that UV radiation increased by 4.20 %, PM2.5 levels decreased by 48.51 %, and O3 levels increased by 22.70 % from 2013–2020, suggesting a potential correlation among these environmental factors. The uneven spatial distribution of UV radiation was associated with factors such as latitude, elevation, meteorological factors, and season. The eastern areas of China pose a higher risk due to both high population density and high UV radiation intensity. Using a machine learning algorithm, this study generated a gridded UV radiation dataset with extensive spatiotemporal coverage, which can be utilized for future health-related research.

Across this chokepoint of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, XBT Sippican T7 probes were launched with a regular 20 km sampling, providing temperature profiles with a vertical resolution of 65 cm and a maximum nominal depth of 760 m. All temperature profiles underwent a rigorous quality control, including a general malfunctioning verification, the removal of spikes, the consistency check of adjacent profiles, the comparison to regional oceanographic features and satellite altimetry observations, and a final visual check by operator. Data quality checks led us to discard about 12 % of acquired XBT measurements.

Our new software, PPCon, uses ocean data to predict key factors like nitrate and chlorophyll levels, which are hard to measure directly. By leveraging machine learning, PPCon offers more accurate and efficient predictions. 
 Effective observation of the ocean is vital for studying and assessing the state and evolution of the marine ecosystem and for evaluating the impact of human activities. However, obtaining comprehensive oceanic measurements across temporal and spatial scales and for different biogeochemical variables remains challenging. Autonomous oceanographic instruments, such as Biogeochemical (BGC)-Argo profiling floats, have helped expand our ability to obtain subsurface and deep-ocean measurements, but measuring biogeochemical variables, such as nutrient concentration, still remains more demanding and expensive than measuring physical variables. Therefore, developing methods to estimate marine biogeochemical variables from high-frequency measurements is very much needed. Current neural network (NN) models developed for this task are based on a multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture, trained over point-wise pairs of input–output features. Although MLPs can produce smooth outputs if the inputs change smoothly, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are inherently designed to handle profile data effectively. In this study, we present a novel one-dimensional (1D) CNN model to predict profiles leveraging the typical shape of vertical profiles of a variable as a prior constraint during training. In particular, the Predict Profiles Convolutional (PPCon) model predicts nitrate, chlorophyll, and backscattering (bbp700) starting from the date and geolocation and from temperature, salinity, and oxygen profiles. Its effectiveness is demonstrated using a robust BGC-Argo dataset collected in the Mediterranean Sea for training and validation. Results, which include quantitative metrics and visual representations, prove the capability of PPCon to produce smooth and accurate profile predictions improving upon previous MLP applications."

Using the Biome-BGCMuSo model, we tested the calibrated parameter sets for simulating European beech forest dynamics across large environmental gradients. Leveraging data from 87 plots and five European countries, the results demonstrated reasonable local accuracy and plausible large-scale productivity responses. 
 Process-based ecosystem models are increasingly important for predicting forest dynamics under future environmental conditions, which may encompass non-analogous climate coupled with unprecedented disturbance regimes. However, challenges persist due to the extensive number of model parameters, scarce calibration data, and trade-offs between the local precision and the applicability of the model over a wide range of environmental conditions. In this paper, we describe a protocol that allows a modeller to collect transferable ecosystem properties based on ecosystem characteristic criteria and to compile the parameters that need to be described in the field.We applied the procedure to develop a new parameterisation for European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) for the Biome-BGCMuSo model, the most advanced member of the Biome-BGC family. For model calibration and testing, we utilised multiyear forest carbon data from 87 plots distributed across five European countries. The initial values of 48 new ecophysiological parameters were defined based on a literature review. The final values of six calibrated parameters were optimised for single sites as well as for multiple sites using generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) and model output conditioning that ensured plausible simulations based on user-defined ranges of carbon stock output variables (carbon stock in aboveground wood biomass, soil, and litter) and finding the intersections of site-specific plausible parameter hyperspaces. To support the model use, we tested the model performance by simulating aboveground tree wood, soil, and litter carbon across a large geographical gradient of central Europe and evaluated the trade-offs between parameters tailored to single plots and parameters estimated using multiple sites.Our findings indicated that parameter sets derived from single sites provided an improved local accuracy of simulations of aboveground wood, soil, and litter carbon stocks by 35 %, 55 %, and 11 % in comparison to the a priori parameter set. However, their broader applicability was very limited. A multi-site optimised parameter set, on the other hand, performed satisfactorily across the entire geographical domain studied here, including on sites not involved in the parameter estimation, but the errors were, on average, 26 %, 35 % and 9 % greater for the aboveground wood, soil, and litter carbon stocks than those obtained with the site-specific parameter sets. Importantly, model simulations demonstrated plausible responses across large-scale environmental gradients, featuring a clear production optimum of beech that aligns with empirical studies. These findings suggest that the model is capable of accurately simulating the dynamics of European beech across its range and can be used for more comprehensive experimentations."

It builds on the LISFLOOD-FP 8.0 and 8.1 papers published in GMD: whereas LISFLOOD-FP 8.0 focussed on GPU-parallelisation, and LISFLOOD-FP 8.1 focussed on static mesh adaptivity of (multi)wavelets, LISFLOOD-FP 8.2 combines GPU-parallelisation with multiwavelet dynamic mesh adaptivity to drastically reduce simulation runtimes, achieving up to a 4.5-fold speedup. 
 The second-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG2) solver of the shallow water equations in LISFLOOD-FP 8.0 is well-suited for predicting small-scale transients that emerge in rapid, multiscale floods caused by impact events like tsunamis. However, this DG2 solver can only be used for simulations on a uniform grid where it may yield inefficient runtimes even when using its graphics processing unit (GPU) parallelised version (GPU-DG2). To maximise runtime reduction, the LISFLOOD-FP 8.2 version integrates GPU parallelised dynamic (in time) grid resolution adaptivity of multiwavelets (MW) with the DG2 solver (GPU-MWDG2). The GPU-MWDG2 solver requires selecting a maximum refinement level, L, based on size and resolution of the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and an error threshold, ε ≤ 10-3, to preserve similar accuracy as a GPU-DG2 simulation on a uniform grid. The accuracy and efficiency of dynamic GPU-MWDG2 adaptivity is assessed for four tsunami-induced flooding test cases involving increasingly complex tsunamis: from single-wave impact events to wave trains. At ε = 10-3, the GPU-MWDG2 simulations yield predictions similar to the GPU-DG2 simulations but using ε = 10-4 can improve the accuracy in velocity-related predictions. In terms of efficiency, the GPU-MWDG2 simulations show progressively larger speedups over the GPU-DG2 simulations from L ≥ 10, which become significant (≥ 3.3- and 4.5-fold at ε = 10-4 and 10-3 , respectively) for simulating a single-wave impact event.

However, the effects of adsorption and complexation on Cd isotope fractionation during the rhizosphere processes remain unclear. Here, we cultivated the Cd hyperaccumulator Sedum alfredii and Cd-tolerance Sedum spectabile in three different soils with citric acid applied as a degradable rhizosphere biostimulant. Cellular elemental distributions in the tissues and Cd isotope compositions were determined through NanoSIMS and MC-ICP-MS, respectively. Cd precipitation/adsorption on cell walls and intracellular regional distribution were the main mechanisms of Cd tolerance in S. spectabile. Plant roots became enriched with heavier Cd isotopes relative to the surrounding soils upon increasing secretion of rhizosphere organic acids. This indicates that organic matter with O and N functional groups preferentially chelates heavy Cd isotopes. In addition, Cd isotope fractionation between roots and shoots varies within the three soils, which could be due to the influence of protein and metallothionein contents in roots and leaves. The finding indicates that sulfur-containing ligands preferentially chelate light Cd isotopes. This study suggests that organic ligands play a vital role in Cd isotope fractionation and consequent hyperaccumulation of soil–plant systems."

We compared differences in urban/rural spatial patterns, demographic compositions, and exposures of particulate matter (PM2.5), greenspace, and land surface temperature using these urban/rural classification systems to understand their impacts on environmental exposure and health research. Our findings reveal clear differences in spatial patterns and demographic compositions across various systems. We also observed that different systems can lead to changes in the magnitude and direction of urban/rural disparities in environmental exposure assessment.

Here, we report paired PFAS measurements in water, sediment, and aquatic biota along a hydrological gradient away from source zones contaminated by the use of legacy aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) manufactured using electrochemical fluorination. Clustering analysis indicates that the PFAS composition characteristic of AFFF is detectable in water and fishes >8 km from the source. Concentrations of 38 targeted PFAS and extractable organofluorine (EOF) decreased in fishes downgradient of the AFFF-contaminated source zones. However, PFAS concentrations remained above consumption limits at all locations within the affected watershed. Perfluoroalkyl sulfonamide precursors accounted for approximately half of targeted PFAS in fish tissues, which explain >90% of EOF across all sampling locations.

The investigation revealed that single metabolites ANA-B and CYL exhibited the highest potency in immobilizing the larvae. Notably, the binary mixture AER-B+CYL induced a remarkably strong synergistic interaction, while other tested binary and ternary mixtures demonstrated antagonistic effects. Both individual metabolites and their mixtures led to a decrease in larval movement speed, with the AER-B+CYL combination showing a very synergistic effect, and strong antagonistic interactions between the oligopeptides in the ternary mixture. Conversely, while AER-B and the binary mixture ANA-B+CYL stimulated vertical movement, other single metabolites and binary and ternary mixtures decreased this parameter. Antagonistic interactions were observed in all mixtures. ANA-B emerged as the most potent inhibitor, yet all tested metabolites and their mixtures decreased larval response to light, displaying synergistic interactions, except for the AER-B+ANA-B mixture at 250 μg L–1 + 250 μg L–1.

In this study, we investigated whether As(III) can be oxidized under reducing conditions using green rust sulfate (GR-SO4), an Fe mineral containing both Fe(II) and Fe(III). Batch sorption experiments showed that GR-SO4 (1 g L–1) effectively sorbs environmentally relevant concentrations of As(III) (50–500 μg L–1) under anoxic, neutral pH conditions with and without citrate (50 μM).

Complete oxidation of As(III) was observed in the presence of citrate. As(III) oxidation can be linked to the phase transformation of GR-SO4 to goethite, resulting in new reactive Fe(III) species that plausibly drive oxidation. Citrate enhanced this process by stabilizing Fe on the mixed GR-SO4/goethite surface, preventing its reduction back to Fe(II) and facilitating further As(III) oxidation without significant Fe loss to the solution. This study highlights the cryptic As(III) oxidation that occurs under reducing conditions, providing new insights into the cycling of arsenic in mixed phases of iron-rich, anoxic environments."

We show that the portion of global land experiencing drought‐conditioned heat anomalies more than tripled in less than 3 decades. However, using such traditional heat waves indicators, the level of spatial coupling between heat waves and drought seems to decline. Conversely, time‐dependent approaches accounting for the baseline climate change offer a more stable perspective.

K‐changes are observed as step‐like increases in the thundercloud electric fields. The K‐changes occur in the late part of intra‐cloud lightning or during negative cloud‐to‐ground lightning between return strokes. It has been shown that the processes leading to K‐changes initiate in the decayed part of a positive leader channel and propagate toward the flash origin. They are often accompanied by microsecond‐scale electric field pulses. We introduce a new model to simulate processes leading to the K‐changes in cloud‐to‐ground lightning. Our method is based on the full solution of Maxwell's equations coupled to Poisson's equation for the thundercloud charge structure. To model the K‐changes, we gradually increase the decayed channel conductivity. The modeled current wavefront propagates due to the K‐processes downward along a vertical channel and completely attenuates before reaching the ground. We derive the evolution of the linear charge densities and the scalar electric potential along the channel leading to K‐changes. We model electrostatic step‐like changes in the measured electric field together with the approximate rates and amplitudes of the microsecond scale pulses. Step‐like changes increase their amplitudes with the length of the simulated channel and with a higher conductivity of the channel. The microsecond‐scale pulse waveshapes depend mainly on the propagation velocity of the current wave, and the time scale of the conductivity increase. We show that our modeled waveforms are in a good agreement with observations conducted in Florida."

Nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) are of great concern due to their impact on human health and the environment. In recent years, machine learning (ML) techniques have been widely used for surface NO2 estimation with rapid developments in computational power and big data. However, the uncertainties inherent to such retrievals are rarely studied. In this study, a novel ML framework has been developed, enhanced with uncertainty quantification techniques, to estimate surface NO2 and provide corresponding data‐induced uncertainty. We apply the Boosting Ensemble Conformal Quantile Estimator (BEnCQE) model to infer surface NO2 concentrations over Western Europe at the daily scale and 1 km spatial resolution from May 2018 to December 2021. High NO2 mainly appears in urban areas, industrial areas, and roads. The space‐based cross‐validation shows that our model achieves accurate point estimates (r = 0.8, R2 = 0.64, root mean square error = 8.08 μg/m3) and reliable prediction intervals (coverage probability, PI‐50%: 51.0%, PI‐90%: 90.5%). Also, the model result agrees with the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) model. The quantile regression in our model enables us to understand the importance of predictors for different NO2 level estimations. Additionally, the uncertainty information reveals the extra potential exceedance of the World Health Organization (WHO) 2021 limit in some locations, which is undetectable by only point estimates. Meanwhile, the uncertainty quantification allows assessment of the model's robustness outside existing in‐situ station measurements. It reveals challenges of NO2 estimation over urban and mountainous areas where NO2 is highly variable and heterogeneously distributed."

Recent studies have suggested that drought projections using Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) and standardized evapotranspiration precipitation index (SPEI) may overestimate drought severity. This overestimation occurs because the potential evapotranspiration (PET) calculations fail to consider the interactive effects of vegetation responses such as increased leaf area index (LAI) and constrained stomatal conductance, which are influenced by elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations ([CO2]). To address this issue, our study replaced the traditional Penman‐Monteith (PM) equation with a recently proposed PET equation that includes the effects of changing [CO2] and LAI to assess droughts at monthly scale in the Upper Yangtze River basin, which experiences the vegetation greening. The findings indicated a consistent increasing trend in drought conditions with minimal discrepancy between the two equations over the historical period (1986–2017). This consistency arises because the water‐saving effects of increased [CO2] and the greening effects of rising LAI largely counterbalance each other. However, for the future period (2018–2100), projections using PM equation predicted an intensification of drought conditions. In contrast, the improved SPEI indicated no significant drought variations, and the improved PDSI suggested a wetting trend. This divergence can be attributed to the water‐saving effects increasingly outweighing the greening effects, as PET shows a decreasing sensitivity to LAI with LAI increasing, but maintains a near‐constant sensitivity to elevated [CO2]. Consequently, the indices based on PM equation tend to overestimate future drought severity. Overall, this study demonstrates that the new PET estimation method is more capable of responding to the changing environment."

 Eukaryotic innate immune systems use pattern recognition receptors to sense infection by detecting pathogen-associated molecular patterns, which then triggers an immune response. Bacteria have similarly evolved immunity proteins that sense certain components of their viral predators, known as bacteriophages1–6. Although different immunity proteins can recognize different phage-encoded triggers, individual bacterial immunity proteins have been found to sense only a single trigger during infection, suggesting a one-to-one relationship between bacterial pattern recognition receptors and their ligands7–11. Here we demonstrate that the antiphage defence protein CapRelSJ46 in Escherichia coli can directly bind and sense two completely unrelated and structurally different proteins using the same sensory domain, with overlapping but distinct interfaces. Our results highlight the notable versatility of an immune sensory domain, which may be a common property of antiphage defence systems that enables them to keep pace with their rapidly evolving viral predators. We found that Bas11 phages harbour both trigger proteins that are sensed by CapRelSJ46 during infection, and we demonstrate that such phages can fully evade CapRelSJ46 defence only when both triggers are mutated. Our work shows how a bacterial immune system that senses more than one trigger can help prevent phages from easily escaping detection, and it may allow the detection of a broader range of phages. More generally, our findings illustrate unexpected multifactorial sensing by bacterial defence systems and complex coevolutionary relationships between them and their phage-encoded triggers.

 Mechanical metamaterials exhibit interesting properties such as high stiffness at low density1–3, enhanced energy absorption3,4, shape morphing5–7, sequential deformations8–11, auxeticity12–14 and robust waveguiding15,16. Until now, metamaterial design has primarily relied on geometry, and materials nonlinearities such as viscoelasticity, fracture and plasticity have been largely left out of the design rationale. In fact, plastic deformations have been traditionally seen as a failure mode and thereby carefully avoided1,3,17,18. Here we embrace plasticity instead and discover a delicate balance between plasticity and buckling instability, which we term ‘yield buckling’. We exploit yield buckling to design metamaterials that buckle sequentially in an arbitrary large sequence of steps whilst keeping a load-bearing capacity. We make use of sequential yield buckling to create metamaterials that combine stiffness and dissipation—two properties that are usually incompatible—and that can be used several times. Hence, our metamaterials exhibit superior shock-absorption performance. Our findings add plasticity to the metamaterial toolbox and make mechanical metamaterials a burgeoning technology with serious potential for mass production.

 Helicobacter pylori disturbs the stomach lining during long-term colonization of its human host, with sequelae including ulcers and gastric cancer1,2. Numerous H. pylori virulence factors have been identified, showing extensive geographic variation1. Here we identify a ‘Hardy’ ecospecies of H. pylori that shares the ancestry of ‘Ubiquitous’ H. pylori from the same region in most of the genome but has nearly fixed single-nucleotide polymorphism differences in 100 genes, many of which encode outer membrane proteins and host interaction factors. Most Hardy strains have a second urease, which uses iron as a cofactor rather than nickel3, and two additional copies of the vacuolating cytotoxin VacA. Hardy strains currently have a limited distribution, including in Indigenous populations in Siberia and the Americas and in lineages that have jumped from humans to other mammals. Analysis of polymorphism data implies that Hardy and Ubiquitous coexisted in the stomachs of modern humans since before we left Africa and that both were dispersed around the world by our migrations. Our results also show that highly distinct adaptive strategies can arise and be maintained stably within bacterial populations, even in the presence of continuous genetic exchange between strains. ‘Hardy’ Helicobacter pylori ecospecies shares the ancestry of ‘Ubiquitous’ H. pylori from the same region in most of the genome but has nearly fixed single-nucleotide polymorphism differences in 100 genes."

 Understanding the origin of bright shooting stars and their meteorite samples is among the most ancient of astronomy-related questions, which at larger scales has human consequences1–3. As of today, only approximately 6% of meteorite falls have been firmly linked to their sources (Moon, Mars or asteroid (4) Vesta4–6). Here we show that approximately 70% of meteorites originate from three recent break-ups of D > 30 km asteroids that occurred 5.8, 7.6 and less than about 40 Myr ago. These break-ups, including the well-known Karin family7, took place in the prominent yet old Koronis and Massalia families and are at the origin of the dominance of H and L ordinary chondrites among meteorite falls. These young families are distinguished among all main belt asteroids by having a uniquely high abundance of small fragments. Their size–frequency distribution remained steep for a few tens of millions of years, exceeding temporarily the production of metre-sized fragments by the largest old asteroid families (for example, Flora and Vesta). Supporting evidence includes the existence of associated dust bands8–10, the cosmic-ray exposure ages of H-chondrite meteorites11,12 and the distribution of the pre-atmospheric orbits of meteorites13–15.

 The prevailing dogma for morphological patterning in developing organisms argues that the combined inputs of transcription factor networks and signalling morphogens alone generate spatially and temporally distinct expression patterns. However, metabolism has also emerged as a critical developmental regulator1–10, independent of its functions in energy production and growth. The mechanistic role of nutrient utilization in instructing cellular programmes to shape the in vivo developing mammalian embryo remains unknown. Here we reveal two spatially resolved, cell-type- and stage-specific waves of glucose metabolism during mammalian gastrulation by using single-cell-resolution quantitative imaging of developing mouse embryos, stem cell models and embryo-derived tissue explants. We identify that the first spatiotemporal wave of glucose metabolism occurs through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway to drive fate acquisition in the epiblast, and the second wave uses glycolysis to guide mesoderm migration and lateral expansion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that glucose exerts its influence on these developmental processes through cellular signalling pathways, with distinct mechanisms connecting glucose with the ERK activity in each wave. Our findings underscore that—in synergy with genetic mechanisms and morphogenic gradients—compartmentalized cellular metabolism is integral in guiding cell fate and specialized functions during development. This study challenges the view of the generic and housekeeping nature of cellular metabolism, offering valuable insights into its roles in various developmental contexts.

 The balance between T helper type 1 (TH1) cells and other TH cells is critical for antiviral and anti-tumour responses1–3, but how this balance is achieved remains poorly understood. Here we dissected the dynamic regulation of TH1 cell differentiation during in vitro polarization, and during in vivo differentiation after acute viral infection. We identified regulators modulating T helper cell differentiation using a unique TH1–TH2 cell dichotomous culture system and systematically validated their regulatory functions through multiple in vitro and in vivo CRISPR screens. We found that RAMP3, a component of the receptor for the neuropeptide CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide), has a cell-intrinsic role in TH1 cell fate determination. Extracellular CGRP signalling through the receptor RAMP3–CALCRL restricted the differentiation of TH2 cells, but promoted TH1 cell differentiation through the activation of downstream cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3). ATF3 promoted TH1 cell differentiation by inducing the expression of Stat1, a key regulator of TH1 cell differentiation. After viral infection, an interaction between CGRP produced by neurons and RAMP3 expressed on T cells enhanced the anti-viral IFNγ-producing TH1 and CD8+ T cell response, and timely control of acute viral infection. Our research identifies a neuroimmune circuit in which neurons participate in T cell fate determination by producing the neuropeptide CGRP during acute viral infection, which acts on RAMP3-expressing T cells to induce an effective anti-viral TH1 cell response.

 Extreme ocean temperature events are becoming increasingly common due to global warming, causing catastrophic ecological and socioeconomic impacts1–5. Despite extensive research on surface marine heatwaves (MHWs) and marine cold spells (MCSs) based on satellite observations6,7, our knowledge of these extreme events and their drivers in the subsurface ocean—home to the majority of marine organisms—is very limited8,9.

We found that 80% of measured MHWs and MCSs below a depth of 100 m do not concur with surface events. In contrast to the weak link between surface MHWs (MCSs) and ocean eddies, nearly one-third of subsurface MHWs (MCSs) in the global ocean, and more than half of such events in subtropical gyres and mid-latitude main current systems, occur within anticyclonic (cyclonic) eddies. These eddy-associated temperature extremes have intensified at rates greater than background level in past decades, suggesting a growing impact of ocean eddies on subsurface MHWs and MCSs with ongoing global warming.

 Many organisms, including cosmopolitan drosophilids, show circadian plasticity, varying their activity with changing dawn–dusk intervals1. How this behaviour evolves is unclear. Here we compare Drosophila melanogaster with Drosophila sechellia, an equatorial, ecological specialist that experiences minimal photoperiod variation, to investigate the mechanistic basis of circadian plasticity evolution2. D. sechellia has lost the ability to delay its evening activity peak time under long photoperiods. Screening of circadian mutants in D. melanogaster/D. sechellia hybrids identifies a contribution of the neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (Pdf) to this loss. Pdf exhibits species-specific temporal expression, due in part to cis-regulatory divergence. RNA interference and rescue experiments in D. melanogaster using species-specific Pdf regulatory sequences demonstrate that modulation of this neuropeptide’s expression affects the degree of behavioural plasticity. The Pdf regulatory region exhibits signals of selection in D. sechellia and across populations of D. melanogaster from different latitudes. We provide evidence that plasticity confers a selective advantage for D. melanogaster at elevated latitude, whereas D. sechellia probably suffers fitness costs through reduced copulation success outside its range. Our findings highlight this neuropeptide gene as a hotspot locus for circadian plasticity evolution that might have contributed to both D. melanogaster’s global distribution and D. sechellia’s specialization.

 The risk of inducing hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) constitutes the main challenge associated with insulin therapy for diabetes1,2. Insulin doses must be adjusted to ensure that blood glucose values are within the normal range, but matching insulin doses to fluctuating glucose levels is difficult because even a slightly higher insulin dose than needed can lead to a hypoglycaemic incidence, which can be anything from uncomfortable to life-threatening. It has therefore been a long-standing goal to engineer a glucose-sensitive insulin that can auto-adjust its bioactivity in a reversible manner according to ambient glucose levels to ultimately achieve better glycaemic control while lowering the risk of hypoglycaemia3. Here we report the design and properties of NNC2215, an insulin conjugate with bioactivity that is reversibly responsive to a glucose range relevant for diabetes, as demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. NNC2215 was engineered by conjugating a glucose-binding macrocycle4 and a glucoside to insulin, thereby introducing a switch that can open and close in response to glucose and thereby equilibrate insulin between active and less-active conformations. The insulin receptor affinity for NNC2215 increased 3.2-fold when the glucose concentration was increased from 3 to 20 mM. In animal studies, the glucose-sensitive bioactivity of NNC2215 was demonstrated to lead to protection against hypoglycaemia while partially covering glucose excursions. NNC2215 is an insulin conjugate that can reversibly adjust its bioactivity in response to a diabetes-relevant glucose range in vivo."

 Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a fatal drug-induced skin reaction triggered by common medications and is an emerging public health issue1–3. Patients with TEN undergo severe and sudden epidermal detachment caused by keratinocyte cell death. Although molecular mechanisms that drive keratinocyte cell death have been proposed, the main drivers remain unknown, and there is no effective therapy for TEN4–6. Here, to systematically map molecular changes that are associated with TEN and identify potential druggable targets, we utilized deep visual proteomics, which provides single-cell-based, cell-type-resolution proteomics7,8. We analysed formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archived skin tissue biopsies of three types of cutaneous drug reactions with varying severity and quantified more than 5,000 proteins in keratinocytes and skin-infiltrating immune cells. This revealed a marked enrichment of type I and type II interferon signatures in the immune cell and keratinocyte compartment of patients with TEN, as well as phosphorylated STAT1 activation. Targeted inhibition with the pan-JAK inhibitor tofacitinib in vitro reduced keratinocyte-directed cytotoxicity. In vivo oral administration of tofacitinib, baricitinib or the JAK1-specific inhibitors abrocitinib or upadacitinib ameliorated clinical and histological disease severity in two distinct mouse models of TEN. Crucially, treatment with JAK inhibitors (JAKi) was safe and associated with rapid cutaneous re-epithelialization and recovery in seven patients with TEN. This study uncovers the JAK/STAT and interferon signalling pathways as key pathogenic drivers of TEN and demonstrates the potential of targeted JAKi as a curative therapy.

 Neural coding has traditionally been examined through changes in firing rates and latencies in response to different stimuli1–5. However, populations of neurons can also exhibit transient bursts of spiking activity, wherein neurons fire in a specific temporal order or sequence6–8. The human brain may utilize these neuronal sequences within population bursts to efficiently represent information9–12, thereby complementing the well-known neural code based on spike rate or latency. Here we examined this possibility by recording the spiking activity of populations of single units in the human anterior temporal lobe as eight participants performed a visual categorization task. We find that population spiking activity organizes into bursts during the task. The temporal order of spiking across the activated units within each burst varies across stimulus categories, creating unique stereotypical sequences for individual categories as well as for individual exemplars within a category. The information conveyed by the temporal order of spiking activity is separable from and complements the information conveyed by the units’ spike rates or latencies following stimulus onset. Collectively, our data provide evidence that the human brain contains a complementary code based on the neuronal sequence within bursts of population spiking to represent information. The temporal order of neuronal firing within bursts of population spiking in the human anterior temporal lobe is dependent on the category as well as the identity of the individual stimulus, and this encodes information independently of spike rate or latency."

 The taste system controls many insect behaviours, yet little is known about how tastants are encoded in mosquitoes or how they regulate critical behaviours. Here we examine how taste stimuli are encoded by Aedes albopictus mosquitoes—a highly invasive disease vector—and how these cues influence biting, feeding and egg laying. We find that neurons of the labellum, the major taste organ of the head, differentially encode a wide variety of human and other cues. We identify three functional classes of taste sensilla with an expansive coding capacity. In addition to excitatory responses, we identify prevalent inhibitory responses, which are predictive of biting behaviour. Certain bitter compounds suppress physiological and behavioural responses to sugar, suggesting their use as potent stop signals against appetitive cues. Complex cues, including human sweat, nectar and egg-laying site water, elicit distinct response profiles from the neuronal repertoire. We identify key tastants on human skin and in sweat that synergistically promote biting behaviours. Transcriptomic profiling identifies taste receptors that could be targeted to disrupt behaviours. Our study sheds light on key features of the taste system that suggest new ways of manipulating chemosensory function and controlling mosquito vectors.

 Human prenatal skin is populated by innate immune cells, including macrophages, but whether they act solely in immunity or have additional functions in morphogenesis is unclear. Here we assembled a comprehensive multi-omics reference atlas of prenatal human skin (7–17 post-conception weeks), combining single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data, to characterize the microanatomical tissue niches of the skin. This atlas revealed that crosstalk between non-immune and immune cells underpins the formation of hair follicles, is implicated in scarless wound healing and is crucial for skin angiogenesis. We systematically compared a hair-bearing skin organoid (SkO) model derived from human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells to prenatal and adult skin1. The SkO model closely recapitulated in vivo skin epidermal and dermal cell types during hair follicle development and expression of genes implicated in the pathogenesis of genetic hair and skin disorders. However, the SkO model lacked immune cells and had markedly reduced endothelial cell heterogeneity and quantity. Our in vivo prenatal skin cell atlas indicated that macrophages and macrophage-derived growth factors have a role in driving endothelial development. Indeed, vascular network remodelling was enhanced following transfer of autologous macrophages derived from induced pluripotent stem cells into SkO cultures. Innate immune cells are therefore key players in skin morphogenesis beyond their conventional role in immunity, a function they achieve through crosstalk with non-immune cells.

 Studies of micrometeorites in mid-Ordovician limestones and impact craters on Earth indicate that our planet witnessed a massive infall of ordinary L chondrite material about 466 million years ago1–3 that may have been at the origin of an Ordovician ice age and major turnover in biodiversity4. The breakup of a large asteroid in the main belt is the likely cause of this massive infall. Currently, material originating from this breakup still dominates meteorite falls (>20% of all falls)5. Here we provide spectroscopic observations and dynamical evidence that the Massalia collisional family is the only plausible source of this catastrophic event and the most abundant class of meteorites falling on Earth today.

 A key concept proposed by Landau to explain superfluid liquid helium is the elementary excitation of quantum particles called rotons1–8. The irregular arrangement of atoms in a liquid leads to the aperiodic dispersion of rotons, which played a pivotal role in understanding fractional quantum Hall liquids (magneto-rotons)9,10 and the supersolidity of Bose–Einstein condensates11–13. Even for a two-dimensional electron or dipole liquid, in the absence of a magnetic field, the repulsive interactions have been predicted to form a roton minimum14–19, which can be used to trace the transition to Wigner crystals20–24 and superconductivity25–27, although this has not yet been observed. Here, we report the observation of such electronic rotons in a two-dimensional dipole liquid of alkali-metal ions donating electrons to surface layers of black phosphorus. Our data reveal the striking aperiodic dispersion of rotons, which is characterized by a local minimum of energy at finite momentum. As the density of dipoles decreases so that interactions dominate over the kinetic energy, the roton gap reduces to 0, as in a crystal, signalling Wigner crystallization. Our model shows the importance of short-range order arising from repulsion between dipoles, which can be viewed as the formation of Wigner crystallites (bubbles or stripes) floating in the sea of a Fermi liquid. Our results reveal that the primary origin of electronic rotons (and the pseudogap) is strong correlations.

 Oil has long been the dominant feedstock for producing fuels and chemicals, but coal, natural gas and biomass are increasingly explored alternatives1–3. Their conversion first generates syngas, a mixture of CO and H2, which is then processed further using Fischer–Tropsch (FT) chemistry. However, although commercial FT technology for fuel production is established, using it to access valuable chemicals remains challenging. A case in point is linear α-olefins (LAOs), which are important chemical intermediates obtained by ethylene oligomerization at present4–8. The commercial high-temperature FT process and the FT-to-olefin process under development at present both convert syngas directly to LAOs, but also generate much CO2 waste that leads to a low carbon utilization efficiency9–14. The efficiency is further compromised by substantially fewer of the converted carbon atoms ending up as valuable C5–C10 LAOs than are found in the C2–C4 olefins that dominate the product mixtures9–14. Here we show that the use of the original phase-pure χ-iron carbide can minimize these syngas conversion problems: tailored and optimized for the process of FT to LAOs, this catalyst exhibits an activity at 290 °C that is 1–2 orders higher than dedicated FT-to-olefin catalysts can achieve above 320 °C (refs. 12–15), is stable for 200 h, and produces desired C2–C10 LAOs and unwanted CO2 with carbon-based selectivities of 51% and 9% under industrially relevant conditions. This higher catalytic performance, persisting over a wide temperature range (250–320 °C), demonstrates the potential of the system for developing a practically relevant technology.

 The Tesla valve benefits the rectification of fluid flow in microfluidic systems1–6 and inspires researchers to design modern solid-state electronic and thermal rectifiers referring to fluid-rectification mechanisms in a liquid-state context. In contrast to the rectification of fluids in microfluidic channels, the rectification of thermal phonons in micro-solid channels presents increased complexity owing to the lack of momentum-conserving collisions between phonons and the infrequent occurrence of liquid-like phonon flows.

 Rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen (N) deposition affect plant communities in numerous ways1–11. Nitrogen deposition causes local biodiversity loss globally12–14, but whether, and if so how, rising CO2 concentrations amplify or dampen those losses remains unclear and is almost entirely unstudied. We addressed this knowledge gap with an open-air experiment in which 108 grassland plots were grown for 24 years under different CO2 and N regimes. We initially found that adding N reduced plant species richness less at elevated than at ambient CO2. Over time, however, this interaction reversed, and elevated CO2 amplified losses in diversity from enriched N, tripling reductions in species richness from N addition over the last eight years of the study. These interactions resulted from temporal changes in the drivers of diversity, especially light availability, that were in turn driven by CO2 and N inputs and associated changes in plant biomass. This mechanism is likely to be similar in many grasslands, because additions of the plant resources CO2 and N are likely to increase the abundance of the dominant species. If rising CO2 generally exacerbates the widespread negative impacts of N deposition on plant diversity, this bodes poorly for the conservation of grassland biodiversity worldwide.

 Dopamine signalling modes differ in kinetics and spatial patterns of receptor activation1,2. How these modes contribute to motor function, motivation and learning has long been debated3–21. Here we show that action-potential-induced dopamine release is dispensable for movement initiation but supports reward-oriented behaviour. We generated mice with dopamine-neuron-specific knockout of the release site organizer protein RIM to disrupt action-potential-induced dopamine release. In these mice, rapid in vivo dopamine dynamics were strongly impaired, but baseline dopamine persisted and fully supported spontaneous movement. Conversely, reserpine-mediated dopamine depletion or blockade of dopamine receptors disrupted movement initiation. The dopamine precursor l-DOPA reversed reserpine-induced bradykinesia without restoring fast dopamine dynamics, a result that substantiated the conclusion that these dynamics are dispensable for movement initiation. In contrast to spontaneous movement, reward-oriented behaviour was impaired in dopamine-neuron-specific RIM knockout mice. In conditioned place preference and two-odour discrimination tasks, the mice effectively learned to distinguish the cues, which indicates that reward-based learning persists after RIM ablation. However, the performance vigour was reduced. During probabilistic cue-reward association, dopamine dynamics and conditioned responses assessed through anticipatory licking were disrupted. These results demonstrate that action-potential-induced dopamine release is dispensable for motor function and subsecond precision of movement initiation but promotes motivation and performance during reward-guided behaviours. Experiments using conditional RIM1 and RIM2 knockout mice and acute pharmacological manipulations clarify the role of rapid dopamine dynamics, whereby these dynamics are dispensable for movement initiation but important for reward-guided conditioned behaviours."

 Islands are renowned as evolutionary laboratories and support many species that are not found elsewhere1,2. Islands are also of great conservation concern, with many of their endemic species currently threatened or extinct3. Here we present a standardized checklist of all known vascular plants that occur on islands and document their geographical and phylogenetic distribution and conservation risk. Our analyses of 304,103 plant species reveal that 94,052 species (31%) are native to islands, which constitute 5.3% of the global landmass4. Of these, 63,280 are island endemic species, which represent 21% of global plant diversity. Three-quarters of these are restricted to large or isolated islands. Compared with the world flora, island endemics are non-randomly distributed within the tree of life, with a total of 1,005 billion years of unique phylogenetic history with 17 families and 1,702 genera being entirely endemic to islands. Of all vascular plants assigned International Union for Conservation of Nature conservation categories5, 22% are island endemics. Among these endemic species, 51% are threatened, and 55% of all documented global extinctions have occurred on islands. We find that of all single-island endemic species, only 6% occur on islands meeting the United Nations 30×30 conservation target. Urgent measures including habitat restoration, invasive species removal and ex situ programmes are needed to protect the world’s island flora.

Woillez,The cool brown dwarf Gliese 229 B is a close binary,"Analysis of the cool brown dwarf Gliese 229 B suggests that it is actually a close binary of two less massive brown dwarfs, explaining its low luminosity and settling the conflict between theoretical predictions and measurements. 
 Owing to their similarities with giant exoplanets, brown dwarf companions of stars provide insights into the fundamental processes of planet formation and evolution. From their orbits, several brown dwarf companions are found to be more massive than theoretical predictions given their luminosities and the ages of their host stars1–3. Either the theory is incomplete or these objects are not single entities. For example, they could be two brown dwarfs each with a lower mass and intrinsic luminosity1,4. The most problematic example is Gliese 229 B (refs. 5,6), which is at least 2–6 times less luminous than model predictions given its dynamical mass of 71.4 ± 0.6 Jupiter masses (MJup) (ref. 1). We observed Gliese 229 B with the GRAVITY interferometer and, separately, the CRIRES+ spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope. Both sets of observations independently resolve Gliese 229 B into two components, Gliese 229 Ba and Bb, settling the conflict between theory and observations. The two objects have a flux ratio of 0.47 ± 0.03 at a wavelength of 2 μm and masses of 38.1 ± 1.0 and 34.4 ± 1.5 MJup, respectively. They orbit each other every 12.1 days with a semimajor axis of 0.042 astronomical units (au). The discovery of Gliese 229 BaBb, each only a few times more massive than the most massive planets, and separated by 16 times the Earth–moon distance, raises new questions about the formation and prevalence of tight binary brown dwarfs around stars. Analysis of the cool brown dwarf Gliese 229 B suggests that it is actually a close binary of two less massive brown dwarfs, explaining its low luminosity and settling the conflict between theoretical predictions and measurements."

 Microquasars are laboratories for the study of jets of relativistic particles produced by accretion onto a spinning black hole. Microquasars are near enough to allow detailed imaging of spatial features across the multiwavelength spectrum. The recent extension measurement of the spatial morphology of a microquasar, SS 433, to TeV gamma rays1 localizes the acceleration of electrons at shocks in the jet far from the black hole2. V4641 Sagittarii (V4641 Sgr) is a similar binary system with a black hole and B-type main-sequence companion star and has an orbit period of 2.8 days (refs. 3,4). It stands out for its super-Eddington accretion5 and for its radio jet, which is one of the fastest superluminal jets in the Milky Way. Previous observations of V4641 Sgr did not report gamma-ray emission6. Here we report TeV gamma-ray emission from V4641 Sgr that reveals particle acceleration at similar distances from the black hole as SS 433. Furthermore, the gamma-ray spectrum of V4641 Sgr is among the hardest TeV spectra observed from any known gamma-ray source and is detected above 200 TeV. Gamma rays are produced by particles, either electrons or protons, of higher energies. Because energetic electrons lose energy more quickly the higher their energy, such a spectrum either very strongly constrains the electron-production mechanism or points to the acceleration of high-energy protons. This suggests that large-scale jets from microquasars could be more common than previously expected and that they could be a notable source of galactic cosmic rays7–9. Ultra-high-energy gamma-ray emission from the microquasar V4641 Sagittarii is reported, suggesting that large-scale jets from microquasars could be more common than previously thought and also could be a notable source of galactic cosmic rays."

 Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has an important yet often overlooked role in health and disease. Constraint models quantify the removal of deleterious variation from the population by selection and represent powerful tools for identifying genetic variation that underlies human phenotypes1–4. However, nuclear constraint models are not applicable to mtDNA, owing to its distinct features. Here we describe the development of a mitochondrial genome constraint model and its application to the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), a large-scale population dataset that reports mtDNA variation across 56,434 human participants5. Specifically, we analyse constraint by comparing the observed variation in gnomAD to that expected under neutrality, which was calculated using a mtDNA mutational model and observed maximum heteroplasmy-level data. Our results highlight strong depletion of expected variation, which suggests that many deleterious mtDNA variants remain undetected. To aid their discovery, we compute constraint metrics for every mitochondrial protein, tRNA and rRNA gene, which revealed a range of intolerance to variation. We further characterize the most constrained regions within genes through regional constraint and identify the most constrained sites within the entire mitochondrial genome through local constraint, which showed enrichment of pathogenic variation. Constraint also clustered in three-dimensional structures, which provided insight into functionally important domains and their disease relevance. Notably, we identify constraint at often overlooked sites, including in rRNA and noncoding regions. Last, we demonstrate that these metrics can improve the discovery of deleterious variation that underlies rare and common phenotypes. Development of a constraint model specifically for mitochondrial DNA and applied to data from the Genome Aggregation Database provides insights into which sites in the mitochondrial genome are important for health and disease."

 Terrestrial photosynthesis, or gross primary production (GPP), is the largest carbon flux in the biosphere, but its global magnitude and spatiotemporal dynamics remain uncertain1. The global annual mean GPP is historically thought to be around 120 PgC yr−1 (refs. 2–6), which is about 30–50 PgC yr−1 lower than GPP inferred from the oxygen-18 (18O) isotope7 and soil respiration8. This disparity is a source of uncertainty in predicting climate–carbon cycle feedbacks9,10. Here we infer GPP from carbonyl sulfide, an innovative tracer for CO2 diffusion from ambient air to leaf chloroplasts through stomata and mesophyll layers. We demonstrate that explicitly representing mesophyll diffusion is important for accurately quantifying the spatiotemporal dynamics of carbonyl sulfide uptake by plants. From the estimate of carbonyl sulfide uptake by plants, we infer a global contemporary GPP of 157 (±8.5) PgC yr−1, which is consistent with estimates from 18O (150–175 PgC yr−1) and soil respiration (

Our global GPP is higher than satellite optical observation-driven estimates (120–140 PgC yr–1) that are used for Earth system model benchmarking. This difference predominantly occurs in the pan-tropical rainforests and is corroborated by ground measurements11, suggesting a more productive tropics than satellite-based GPP products indicated. As GPP is a primary determinant of terrestrial carbon sinks and may shape climate trajectories9,10, our findings lay a physiological foundation on which the understanding and prediction of carbon–climate feedbacks can be advanced.

 Infant cerebral blood flow (CBF) delivers nutrients and oxygen to fulfill brain energy consumption requirements for the fastest period of postnatal brain development across the lifespan. However, organizing principle of whole-brain CBF dynamics during infancy remains obscure. Leveraging a unique cohort of 100+ infants with high-resolution arterial spin labeled MRI, we find the emergence of the cortical hierarchy revealed by the highest-resolution infant CBF maps available to date. Infant CBF across cortical regions increases in a biphasic pattern featured by initial rapid and subsequently slower rate, and break-point ages increasing along the limbic-sensorimotor-association cortical gradient. Increases in CBF in sensorimotor cortices are associated with enhanced language and motor skills, and frontoparietal association cortices with cognitive skills. The study discovers emergence of the hierarchical limbic-sensorimotor-association cortical gradient in infancy and offers standardized reference of infant brain CBF and insight into the physiological basis of cortical specialization and real-world infant developmental functioning.

Using standard telecom components, it enables GHz bandwidth, nanosecond programmability, and MHz-level resolution. 
 Controlling the temporal evolution of an electromagnetic (EM) wave’s frequency components, the so-called time-frequency (TF) distribution, in a versatile and real-time fashion remains very challenging, especially at the high speeds (> GHz regime) required in contemporary communication, imaging, and sensing applications. We propose a general framework for manipulating the TF properties of high-speed EM waves. Specifically, the TF distribution is continuously mapped along the time domain through phase-only processing, enabling its user-defined manipulation via widely-available temporal modulation techniques. The time-mapping operations can then be inverted to reconstruct the TF-processed signal. Using off-the-shelf telecommunication components, we demonstrate arbitrary control of the TF distribution of EM waves over a full bandwidth approaching 100 GHz with nanosecond-scale programmability and MHz-level frequency resolution. We further demonstrate applications for mitigating rapidly changing frequency interference terms and the direct synthesis of fast waveforms with customized TF distributions. The reported method represents a significant advancement in TF processing of EM waves and it fulfills the stringent requirements for many modern and emerging applications.

 Fungal pathogens must exhibit strong nutritional plasticity, effectively sensing and utilizing diverse nutrients to support virulence. How the signals generated by nutritional sensing are efficiently translated to the morphogenetic machinery for optimal growth and support of virulence remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that the conserved morphogenesis-related kinase, CotA, imparts isoform-specific control over Aspergillus fumigatus invasive growth in host-mimicking environments and during infection. CotA-mediated invasive growth is responsive to exogenous carbon source quality, with only preferred carbon sources supporting hyphal morphogenesis in a mutant lacking one of two identified protein isoforms. Strikingly, we find that the CotA protein does not regulate, nor is cotA gene expression regulated by, the carbon catabolite repression system. Instead, we show that CotA partially mediates invasive growth in specific carbon sources and virulence through the conserved downstream effector and translational repressor, SsdA. Therefore, A. fumigatus CotA accomplishes its conserved morphogenetic functions to drive pathogenic growth by translating host-relevant carbon source quality signals into morphogenetic outputs for efficient tissue invasive growth.

 Earthquake swarms may be driven by fluids, through hydraulic injections or natural fluid circulation, but also by slow and aseismic slip transients. Understanding the driving factors for these prolific sequences and how they can potentially develop into larger ruptures remains a challenge. A notable and almost ubiquitous feature of swarms is their hypocenters migration, which occurrence is closely related to the processes driving the observed seismicity, in a similar way as seismicity accompanies slow-slip events at subduction zones. Here, we analyze global data on migrating sequences, and identify scaling laws for migration velocity, moment and duration measured on natural and injection-induced swarms, foreshock sequences, and slow slip events. We highlight two different behaviors among these sequences: one linked to slow slips, with elevated migration velocities and moments, and the other related to fluid-induced processes, featuring lower velocities and moments. These results provide metrics for distinguishing between the drivers of earthquake swarms, fluid or slow-slip related, and prompt a reevaluation of scaling laws of fault slip transients, especially for swarms.

Here it is shown that external N sources precisely regulate N fixation efficiency by modulating iron transport in nodules of legumes. 
 Symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) in legume-rhizobia serves as a sustainable source of nitrogen (N) in agriculture. However, the addition of inorganic N fertilizers significantly inhibits SNF, and the underlying mechanisms remain not-well understood. Here, we report that inorganic N disrupts iron (Fe) homeostasis in soybean nodules, leading to a decrease in SNF efficiency. This disruption is attributed to the inhibition of the Fe transporter genes Natural Resistance-Associated Macrophage Protein 2a and 2b (GmNRAMP2a&2b) by inorganic N. GmNRAMP2a&2b are predominantly localized at the tonoplast of uninfected nodule tissues, affecting Fe transfer to infected cells and consequently, modulating SNF efficiency. In addition, we identified a pair of N-signal regulators, nitrogen-regulated GARP-type transcription factors 1a and 1b (GmNIGT1a&1b), that negatively regulate the expression of GmNRAMP2a&2b, which establishes a link between N signaling and Fe homeostasis in nodules. Our findings reveal a plausible mechanism by which soybean adjusts SNF efficiency through Fe allocation in response to fluctuating inorganic N conditions, offering valuable insights for optimizing N and Fe management in legume-based agricultural systems.

 Atmospheric turbulence, irregular fluctuations of the fluid state, is studied on Mars. Universality of the turbulence spectrum underpins atmospheric models where computational requirements preclude full fidelity simulations of the smallest scales. However, there are discrepancies among reports on the existence and spectral location of universal scaling in Martian atmospheric data. Here, results indicate the smallest resolvable structures from Martian wind speed data are still associated with the energetic regime, which may ultimately explain why multiple reports have not found a consistent Kolmogorov-like spectral regime on Mars. Universal spectral scaling of wind data from Perseverance’s Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer is used to estimate the thresholds that separate three turbulence regimes: energetic, inertial, and molecular dissipation. Wind measurements at 2-Hz, the fastest sampling rate for direct wind sensor measurements on Mars, resolves turbulence in the energetic regime and approaches the inertial regime, which is consistent with reported Martian dust devil sizes.

 The early detection of forest pests and diseases is a primary focus of remote sensing applications for forest health monitoring. Pine Wilt Disease (PWD), which causes significant damage to pine resources in many countries and regions, has been a key area where the close-range hyperspectral remote sensing has demonstrated its advantages for early diagnosis. However, it remains unclear whether PWD can be detected during the pre-visual stage and, if so, how to achieve hyperspectral detection. This study aimed to investigate the impacts of pine species, infection responses, and data types on hyperspectral detection of PWD, particularly in the pre-visual stage. Artificial inoculation experiments were conducted across three locations with 76 sample trees of two pine species, and hyperspectral data were collected regularly using ground-based non-imaging and UAV imaging spectrometers Five infection responses were identified: keep healthy (KH), quick infection (QI), slow recovery (SR), quick recovery (QR), and slow infection (SI). Spectral analysis revealed dynamic changes in the indices RVI (680–550,750) and NDVI (560,680), corresponding well with the spectral characteristics of the five infection responses. The infected trees with QI response could be spectrally detected starting from day 14, with over 50 % accuracy. Importance analysis using RF identified RVI (554,677) and NDVI (531,570) as consistent in detecting pre-visual stages. In contrast, the six VIs determined by PCA-S (RARSb, RVI (900, 680), RVI (800, 680), RVI (760, 500), RVI (800, 635), and REP) exhibited high consistency and played a crucial role in identifying pre-visual stage infected trees. These VIs combined with specific color bands, enabled the creation of false-color images highlighting infected trees starting from day 14 post-inoculation. The study highlighted the importance of recognizing infection response patterns for accurate PWD detection, with only QI response trees showed a stable infection cycle, making day 14 post-infection a meaningful starting point for spectral detection. Additionally, imaging and non-imaging data types did not significantly affect the detection process, and the impact of spectral resolution variations between 1 nm and 3.5 nm was negligible. Further research is required to determine the threshold for larger differences of spectral resolution and to explore detection across various pine species and growth environments."

 The terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA), derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its successor, the GRACE Follow-on (GRACE-FO) satellite, presents a remarkable opportunity for extreme weather detection and the enhancement of environmental protection. However, the practical utility of GRACE data is challenged by an 11-month data gap and several months of missing data. To address this limitation, we have developed an innovative transformer-based deep learning model for data gap-filling. This model incorporates a self-attention mechanism using causal convolution, allowing the neural network to capture the local context of GRACE time series data. It takes into account various factors such as temperature (T), precipitation (P), and evapotranspiration (ET). We trained the model using a global dataset of 10,000 time series pixels and applied it to fill all the time gaps. The validation results demonstrate its robustness, with an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.18 cm and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.906. Notably, the Transformer-based method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in arid regions. The incorporation of T, P, and ET has further enhanced the accuracy of gap filling, with an average RMSE decrease of 7.5 %. This study has produced a reliable gap-filling product that addresses 11-month data gaps and 24 isolated gaps, ensuring the continuity of GRACE data for various scholarly applications. Moreover, our Transformer approach holds important potential for surpassing traditional methods in predicting and filling gaps in remote sensing data and gridded observations."

 Precise spatial mapping of individual species using hyperspectral data is crucial for effective forest management and policy-making. This study focuses on Rhododendron arboreum, known for its medicinal properties attributed to the flavonoid Quercitrin. Sample data and spectroradiometer data were collected from the complex terrain of the Kumaon region in the Himalayas. Hyperspectral data, which includes signal variations based on biophysical and biochemical properties along with noise, were preprocessed using filtering techniques to enhance signal clarity by removing noise. Smoothing techniques were applied to remove noisy bands from the spectra, such as the Savitzky-Golay filter for reduced least square fit complexity and the Average Mean filter for taking mean spectral values. Subsequently, Spectral Analysis (SA) techniques, including first derivative, second derivative, and continuum removal, were employed. These mathematical transformations highlighted absorption troughs and determined the effect of Quercitrin on spectral wavelengths. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to identify the most relevant bands related to Quercitrin. Additionally, regression analysis was applied on resampled spectral data, selected significant wavelengths based on variable importance values, pinpointing the most prominent wavelengths: 1196, 1229, 1328, 1383, 1425, 1636, 1661, 1699, 1785, and 1715 nm. Over 50 two-band combination indices were tested, and those with p-values less than 0.05 were deemed significant. For the development of prediction model, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), were applied. The Random Forest model, which splits input data into trees to simulate the best model based on observed values, demonstrated high effectiveness in predicting Quercitrin levels, achieving a training correlation of 0.864 and a testing correlation of 0.570.

 The Iberian Peninsula (IP), where this study is conducted, has experienced an increase of the frequency and intensity of Saharan aerosol dust outbreaks over the latest decades, which may have an impact on its regional climate. The Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-chem) has been used worldwide to simulate dust outbreaks and can support the analysis of such potential impacts. However, it includes multiple alternative aerosol parameterization choices that have not been conveniently evaluated in the study region yet. Here, three of the most popular WRF-chem aerosol parameterization schemes, namely, the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART), the Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and Chemistry (MOSAIC) and the Modal Aerosol Dynamics Model for Europe (MADE) schemes, are inter-compared during a strong and dry dust outbreak on July 2021 in southern IP. The results show that the three schemes predict qualitatively similar dust intrusion patterns that are consistent with ground observations and have inter-model dust loading differences smaller than 4%. However, their average dust size distributions differ notably. While GOCART is reasonably consistent with observations, MOSAIC underpredicts the amount of dust particles with sub-micron diameters and overpredicts that of large particles and MADE does the opposite. This is found to have a strong detrimental impact on the prediction performance of dust optical properties in MOSAIC and MADE, which is related, at least partially, with issues in the required inter-sectional redistribution of dust parameters during the dust emission and calculation of optical properties. Overall, GOCART generally appears a better choice for strong and dry dust outbreak events in southern IP. It remains to be evaluated during wet dust outbreaks, which is a work underway."

 Extreme precipitation events (EPEs) are crucial in Antarctica, impacting the Antarctic ice sheet's surface mass balance and stability. Comprehensive case studies are essential for better understanding these events and the underlying processes driving them. Here, we investigate an extreme snowfall event in Dronning Maud Land (DML), East Antarctica on November 8 and 9, 2015. This event contributed approximately 22 % of the annual accumulation in less than two days and exhibited high spatial variability in precipitation distribution. We employed a high-resolution atmospheric model specifically optimized for the polar regions (Polar WRF) and ERA5 reanalysis data to analyze the event in detail. Our findings highlight the importance of a blocking high-pressure ridge of record strength that effectively blocked and diverted a strong extratropical cyclone into DML, ultimately leading to the heavy snowfall event. The sudden deepening of the cyclone was initiated by a ‘jet streak’ in the upper atmosphere that steered the system southeastwards towards the Antarctic coast. Notably, we observed an anomalously high poleward moisture transport in the form of a strong atmospheric river on November 7, 2015. This atmospheric river originated in the South Atlantic Ocean and tracked poleward from the 30°S-40°S latitude band. Vertical cross-sections of the model outputs indicate that most of the precipitation was concentrated in regions with steep orography along the path of the atmospheric river. This interaction between the atmospheric river and the steep terrain led to the uplift of maritime air, resulting in heavy snowfall. This study highlights the significance of extreme upper and lower atmospheric conditions in driving intense moisture transport towards coastal DML. The interaction between the atmospheric river and the steep orography contributed to heavy snowfall, underscoring the importance of considering orographic influences in understanding EPEs in Antarctica."

Framing aquaculture as a monolith, however, overlooks its extreme taxonomic diversity. This paper assesses the welfare risks associated with that diversity, establishing seven species-level risk factors from involved parental care to long lifespans. Investigating these welfare risks across all aquatic species reported to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) revealed an uneven distribution of risk, with extreme species-level risks in chordates, crustaceans, and cephalopod mollusks. Compared to species with fewer risks, species with extreme welfare risks were found to cost more and contribute the least to global production. This work challenges the notion that prioritizing animal welfare is incompatible with addressing food security and creates the possibility of identifying certain plant and invertebrate species, like seaweeds and bivalves, that minimize welfare concerns while providing affordability and accessibility. Going forward, proactive welfare approaches are needed to inform consumer choice and shape just and sustainable aquaculture policy."

Dissolution-dynamic nuclear polarization (d-DNP) is a state-of-the-art technology that can markedly enhance the sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), providing metabolic and physiological information in vivo. However, the hyperpolarized state exponentially decays back to the thermal equilibrium, depending on the spin-lattice relaxation time (T1). Because of the limitation inT1, peptide-based DNP NMR molecular probes applicable in vivo have been limited to amino acids or dipeptides. Here, we report the direct detection of in vivo metabolic conversions of hyperpolarized13C-oligopeptides. Structure-basedT1relaxation analysis suggests that the C-terminal [1-13C]Gly-d2residue affords sufficientT1for biological uses, even in relatively large oligopeptides, and allowed us to develop13C-β-casomorphin-5 and13C-glutathione.

Pancreatic-specific knockout of the SEMA3D gene from the KRASG12Dand TP53R172Hmutation knock-in, PDX1-Cre(KPC) mouse model demonstrated delayed tumor initiation, prolonged survival, absence of metastasis, and reduced M2 macrophage expression. Mechanistically, tumor- and nerve-derived SEMA3D indirectly reprograms macrophages through KRASMUT-dependent ARF6 signaling in PDA cells, resulting in increased lactate production, which is sensed by GPCR132 on macrophages to stimulate protumorigenic M2 polarization. Multiplex immunohistochemistry demonstrated increased M2-polarized macrophages proximal to nerves in SEMA3D-expressing human PDA tissue. This study suggests that altered SEMA3D expression leads to an acquisition of cancer-promoting functions, and nerve-derived SEMA3D is “hijacked” by PDA cells to support growth and metastasis in a KRASMUT-dependent manner."

Mechanistically, ApoE secreted by the MITFhigh/AXLlowcells protects the invasive phenotype from ferroptosis-inducing agents by reducing the content of peroxidation-prone polyunsaturated fatty acids and boosting GPX4 levels both in vitro and in vivo. Whole-exome sequencing indicates thatAPOEhighexpression in patients with melanoma is associated with resistance to ferroptosis, regardless ofAPOEgermline status.

Furthermore, inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase with erlotinib hydrochloride attenuated stromal activation.

We explore this question with large-scale networks of spatially ordered spiking neuron models where a downstream network receives input from an upstream sender network. We show that linear measures of the communication between the sender and receiver networks can discriminate between emergent or inherited population dynamics. A match in the dimensionality of the sender and receiver population activities promotes faithful communication. In contrast, a nonlinear mapping between the sender to receiver activity, for example, through downstream emergent population-wide fluctuations, can impair linear communication. Our work exposes the benefits and limitations of linear measures when analyzing between-area communication in circuits with rich population-wide neuronal dynamics."

However, 2′3′-cGAMP function beyond innate immunity remains elusive. Here, we report that 2′3′-cGAMP promotes cell migration independent of innate immunity. 2′3′-cGAMP interactome analysis identifies the small GTPase Rab18 as a 2′3′-cGAMP binding partner and effector in cell migration control. Mechanistically, 2′3′-cGAMP binds Rab18 to facilitate GTP loading and subsequent Rab18 activation, which further promotes FosB transcription in facilitating cell migration. Induced synthesis of endogenous 2′3′-cGAMP by intrabreast tumor bacteriumS. aureusinfection or low-dose doxorubicin treatment facilitates cell migration depending on the cGAS/cGAMP/Rab18/FosB signaling. We find that lovastatin induces Rab18 deprenylation that abolishes 2′3′-cGAMP recognition therefore suppressing cell migration.

Previous studies attributed sources and impacts of rBC in the northern Antarctic Peninsula region by investigating long-range atmospheric transport from South Hemisphere biomass burning and industrial regions or by assessing impacts from local tourism and research activities. We used high-resolution measurements of refractory rBC in a firn core collected near the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, as well as atmospheric rBC from Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2, satellite measurements, modeling, burned area data, and tourism statistics, to assess combined impacts of both long-range transported rBC and locally emitted rBC. Our findings suggest that tourism activities have a regional rather than local impact and the increase in rBC concentrations during late spring-summer, influenced by tourism activities and fires in the Southern Hemisphere, can enhance ice melt.

This suggests that the rate-strengthening friction commonly measured in clay-rich materials may govern episodic slow slip in landslides, in addition to tectonic faults. Further, our results show more generally that transient slow slip can arise in velocity-strengthening materials from modulation of effective normal stress through pore pressure fluctuations. This challenges the idea that episodic slow slip requires a narrow range of transitional frictional properties near the stability threshold, or pore pressure feedbacks operating on initially unstable frictional slip."

PNFs are rich in immune cells, but whether immune cells are necessary for tumorigenesis is unknown. We show that inhibition of stimulator of interferon gene (STING) reduces plasma CXCL10, tumor T cell and dendritic cell (DC) recruitment, and tumor formation. Further, mice lacking XCR-1+DCs showed reduced tumor-infiltrating T cells and PNF tumors. Antigen-presenting cells from tumor-bearing mice promoted CD8+T cell proliferation in vitro, and PNF T cells expressed high levels of CCL5, implicating T cell activation. Notably, tumors and nerve-associated macrophages were absent in Rag1−/−; Nf1f/f; DhhCre mice and adoptive transfer of CD8+T cells from tumor-bearing mice restored PNF initiation. In this setting, PNF shrunk upon subsequent T cell removal. Thus, STING pathway activation contributes to CD8+T cell–dependent inflammatory responses required for PNF initiation and maintenance."

Using an in situ reverse transcription–based sequencing method, we study nuclear speckle–associated human transcripts. Our data indicate the existence of three gene groups whose transcripts demonstrate different speckle localization properties: stably enriched in nuclear speckles, transiently enriched in speckles at the pre–messenger RNA stage, and not enriched. We find that stably enriched transcripts contain inefficiently excised introns and that disruption of nuclear speckles specifically affects splicing of speckle-enriched transcripts. We further reveal RNA sequence features contributing to transcript speckle localization, indicating a tight interplay between transcript speckle enrichment, genome organization, and splicing efficiency. Collectively, our data highlight a role of nuclear speckles in both co- and posttranscriptional splicing regulation.

This has raised concerns about the practice’s impact on wild fish stocks, ecosystems, and coastal communities that rely on these fish. The aquaculture industry claims a decreasing dependence on wild fish, relying on the Fish In:Fish Out (FIFO) metric as a ratio of the quantity of wild fish required for farmed fish production. This is misleading because it usually assumes constant FM or FO yields, inclusion rates and feed conversion ratios, which vary widely. Thus, a constant FIFO value for a given species cannot be assumed. Furthermore, low FIFO values resulting from averaging carnivores and herbivores conceal the high feed requirements of carnivore species. The increasing use of FMFO from by-products does not demonstrate a decreased use of wild fish but rather reflects a growing demand for FMFO, particularly for the fast growing and valuable salmon and shrimp farming industries."
