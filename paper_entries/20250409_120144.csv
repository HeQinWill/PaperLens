In order to clarify the linkage characteristics between EC and enterprise ESG performance and the function mechanism, this paper examines the relationship between EC on enterprise ESG performance in Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2010 to 2023. Research found that: (1) EC significantly suppresses corporate greenwashing (GW) behavior. (2) EC suppresses corporate GW behavior by strengthening ESG information disclosure. After parallel trend testing, multi period DID, and placebo testing, the above results remain robust. Further analysis shows that: (1) EC significantly promotes ESG performance. (2) In enterprises with high levels of green innovation, EC has a significant impact on their ESG performance; On the contrary, in companies with low levels of green innovation, EC has no significant impact on their ESG performance. It reveals the influence and ways of EC on the ESG performance of enterprises under the background of high-quality sustainable development of economy, enriches the research on EC and the ESG performance of enterprises, and provides certain theoretical support and practical enlightenment for the sustainable development of enterprises."

However, considering the regional nature of air pollution nationwide and the significant emission load from rural areas, a potentially large fraction of urban PM2.5 might originate from emissions outside of a city’s boundary, i.e. transboundary emissions. Here, we couple top-down (STILT-PM2.5) and bottom-up (WRF-Chem) modeling approaches with a new, nationwide, monthly-resolved, and fine-scale (5 km × 5 km) anthropogenic emission inventory to assess the impact of transboundary emissions to urban PM2.5 concentrations across 143 cities (122 NCAP and 67 million plus -cities with population >1 million, among which 46 cities are also NCAP cities). We find that, on average, ∼85% (STILT-PM2.5: 82% [95% CI: 80–85%; IQR: 77%–94%] & WRF-Chem: 89% [95% CI: 87%–91%; IQR: 88%–96%]) of urban PM2.5 across the 143 cities originates from transboundary emissions, with domestic biomass burning (32%), energy generation (16%) and industry (15%) being the leading average emission sources to the transboundary contribution. In addition, 107 of the 122 NCAP cities from both modeling approaches have annual transboundary PM2.5 contributions exceeding 80%, indicating that an entire mitigation of within-boundary emissions alone in these cities will not achieve the most conservative targets outlined as part of NCAP. Our findings underscore the need for multi-scale, regional action planning and implementation to achieve PM2.5-air quality targets throughout India."

Herein, we investigate how city-level ozone pollution would be affected by self- and collaborative mitigation actions among and beyond the 60 cities, by a modeling analysis of the daily maximum 8 h average ozone for summer (June–July–August). We find that a local uniform 20% cut in anthropogenic emissions would decrease ozone by a mere 2.6% and even worsen ozone over two cities. Due to cross-city ozone transport, the implementation of a range of city-specific emission cuts from 10% to 30% resulted in ozone changes that were essentially the same as those obtained from a uniform 20% cut. By contrast, a 20% emission cut across the entire country would decrease ozone in the 60 cities by 4.5% with no ozone deterioration in any city. Furthermore, owing to the transitioned ozone chemical regime and extended ozone chemical lifetime, the transboundary ozone from outside the two plains would be enhanced by emission reductions in the 60 cities (e.g. an increase by 68% with complete removal of emissions), leading to a significant suppression (about 23%) on the expected benefit. Nationwide collaborative action is essential for more effective city-level ozone mitigation."

Identifying gaps in the consideration of freshwater ecosystems,"Growing evidence suggests that freshwater ecosystems incur exacerbated impacts during drought due to anthropogenic activities. This has prompted calls for the development of drought management strategies that more effectively incorporate these ecosystems. Efforts to examine how drought management instruments care for freshwater ecosystems are scarce, limited to a few geographic regions, and do not systematically analyse each of the elements of the drought management process. In this study, we review drought management instruments in 26 countries or regions within countries to assess the extent and the manner with which freshwater ecosystems are considered. We apply an analytical framework integrating knowledge from drought management, ecological risk assessment and ecological drought to extract data from these instruments and identify patterns and gaps. Results indicate that care for freshwater ecosystems in drought management is as yet at an early stage. This is reflected in the limited inclusion of freshwater ecosystems across critical elements of the drought management process, as well as significant shortcomings in how these ecosystems are considered. We synthesise these shortcomings in four gaps. First, the socio-ecological perspective of ecological drought, particularly regarding the combined natural-human causes of drought impacts on freshwater ecosystems, is often lacking in drought definitions, exposure and vulnerability assessments. Second, despite their importance to ecosystems, there is limited consideration of variables related to groundwater, water quality, and aquatic habitats in freshwater ecosystem indicators, exposure assessments and measures. Third, the duration, frequency and timing of drought, which are relevant to the ecology of freshwater ecosystems, are rarely considered in drought indicators and measures. Finally, exposure and vulnerability assessments often lack a comprehensive understanding of ecological drought risk in freshwater ecosystems. We discuss these gaps and provide an outlook towards more integrated and sustainable drought policy and management."

It is evident that micro-sized wastes are just as significant as macro-sized ones, and this issue should be prioritized. The use of textile waste in sound insulation materials is increasingly gaining attention. However, conventional sound absorption materials, such as fiberglass, polyurethane, and melamine foams, offer high-performance acoustic properties, but are derived from non-renewable resources and contribute to environmental degradation. This study aims to develop environmentally friendly fibrous sound absorption panels by reusing MF waste generated during textile finishing processes. Waste MFs used within the scope of the study were collected from a textile finishing process’ wastewater containing a variety of fibers, including wool, cotton, acrylic, polyamide, polyester, polypropylene, and viscose by filtration method and blended with polyester fiber as a binder. Then, acoustic panels were produced using a hot press technique by varying the panel thickness, density, and binder fiber ratio, and the physical, chemical, morphological, and acoustic properties of these panels were tested. Findings revealed that thickness emerged as a critical factor, with the thickest samples exhibiting the highest sound absorption coefficient (0.9 at 3000 Hz). Moreover, an increase in sample density correlated positively with enhanced sound absorption values, while the binder fiber ratio demonstrated a negative impact. Additionally, all samples exhibited hydrophobic characteristics, showcasing water resistance. The statistical analysis of sound absorption performance was conducted using one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s honestly significant difference test, with the results visualized through boxplots. Compared to conventional materials, the developed MF-based panels provide an eco-friendly alternative by reducing reliance on virgin synthetic materials while achieving competitive sound absorption properties. This study enables sustainable waste management in the textile industry and the reuse of MF waste, providing alternative and environmentally friendly solutions to currently used sound absorption materials. While the recyclability and reuse potential of these panels remain promising, further research is needed to evaluate their long-term mechanical performance, resistance to environmental degradation, and practical implementation in real-world applications. Future investigations should focus on optimizing large-scale production processes and assessing the environmental footprint of these materials throughout their lifecycle."

We investigated risk of cause-specific mortality associated with AFO/CAFOs and related disparities for North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia (2000–2020). We estimated associations between AFO/CAFO exposure and mortality (anemia, asthma, COPD, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease, and kidney disease) using logistic regression. For each participant, we applied two exposure metrics based on buffers around population-weighted ZIP-code centroids: (1) binary exposure based on presence or absence of AFOs/CAFOs, and (2) exposure intensity (no exposure, low, medium, and high). We investigated health disparities by individual-level (sex, race/ethnicity, age, education, marital status) and community-level (race, income, poverty, education, racial isolation, educational isolation) characteristics. Presence of AFO/CAFOs was associated with higher risks of cause-specific mortality, particularly for diabetes mellitus or cerebrovascular disease, across all states. People in ZIP codes within ⩽10 km of AFO/CAFO were 1.028 (95% Confidence Interval 1.014, 1.042), 1.039 (1.025, 1.053), and 1.053 (1.031, 1.075) times more likely to die from cerebrovascular disease compared to those in ZIP codes without AFO/CAFO exposure for North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, respectively. We found disproportionate health burden associated with AFO/CAFO exposure in some subpopulations, however results varied by state. Our findings provide evidence of higher mortality risk with high AFO/CAFO exposure, with some populations facing disproportionate health burden, although such relationships differed by location."

In addition, it is necessary to clarify the amount of energy that can be potentially produced from these novel technologies. This study presents a global assessment of the energy potential of an unconventional wind energy technology called airborne wind energy system (AWES) for onshore applications. This technology has a considerably small material footprint and visual impact compared to the conventional wind turbines. The target technology is a system currently available in the market that generates electricity based on a soft kite connected by a tether to a generator. It was found that globally, this technology can theoretically deliver 38.5 PWh yr−1. After considering topographic and land suitability restrictions the energy potential decreases to 12.5 PWh yr−1 (equivalent to around half of 2022 electricity consumption). The high-grade energy potential (annual average capacity factor >32%) constituted around three quarters of the global total. Further analyses will clarify the effect of uncertainties involved in the assessment (such as the height of operation and the land suitability constraints, among others), and the conditions under which AWES outperform conventional wind turbines. Also, the assessment can be extended to offshore applications and to include the economic evaluation of the energy potential. This study is a first attempt to assess the global potential of an unconventional wind energy technology which can be considered in the analysis of future decarbonization scenarios."

Yet there has been little analysis of how quickly carbon dioxide removal (CDR) strategies could scale to meet this expected need. We develop a new integrated modeling approach for assessing scalability that combines insights from the history of analogous technological revolutions with information about the efficacy and specific constraints of CDR strategies. We illustrate our approach with genetically enhanced crops that grow larger roots and, in turn, increase soil carbon. Unlike many CDR technologies whose deployment will be slowed by the need for novel and costly infrastructures, history suggests that crop innovations can scale rapidly in countries that admit them. Within 13 years of first deployment, diffusion of enhanced crops could peak and remove 0.9–1.2 GtCO2 yr–1—about 7 times larger than all CO2 offsets supplied today to the global voluntary offsets market. Upscaling depends on policy and politics, as they affect the total land area on which carbon-absorbing crops are allowed. Early scaling could allow crop engineering to play an outsized role in a portfolio of CDR strategies that, overall, scales to IPCC-like levels of carbon removal, even though carbon storage in soils is less permanent than geological storage."

Due to the lack of city-scale evidence, the urbanisation-landslide interaction has been commonly studied locally, focusing on individual landslides or road segments. We study the expansion of the metropolitan area of Medellín, Colombia, in 18-time steps since 1770 and explore the empirical relationship between urban expansion, landslide occurrences, and fatalities. Between the 1930s and 2023, Medellín’s population increased from about 120 thousand to 2.5 million inhabitants, while its area expanded from 9 km2 to 107 km2. Landslide occurrences have gradually increased since the 1930s with a volatile positive trend. In contrast, landslide fatalities have been fluctuating without a clear trend. Landslides have predominantly impacted the outskirts of the urban area, causing harm primarily to newly emerged neighbourhoods towards the city’s north, northeast, and west especially since 1960s. Thus, we argue that struggling settlement on Medellín’s margins has likely increased the city’s landslide hazards. Landslides kill 2 to 3.5 times more people per km2 in informal neighbourhoods (categorised as Informal II and III) than in the most hazardous formal neighbourhood type. We recommend that land-use policies assess whether planned future land transformations could alter an area’s inherent hazard status rather than relying solely on existing hazard levels for permits."

To address this, we here introduce the CDR sustainable portfolios with endogenous cost model, a mixed-integer linear optimization model for cost-optimal and time-dependent CDR portfolios including endogenous treatment of technology cost dynamics. We explore future uncertainty in three key dimensions: realisable mitigation potentials, cost dynamics, and resource constraints. Our results demonstrate that afforestation and reforestation, and soil carbon sequestration appear as robust options, deployed regardless of the removals required. Direct air carbon capture and storage emerges as the most deployed technology in 2100 at median value (6.7 GtCO2 yr−1), but with the widest range of possible outcomes (interquartile range from 4 to 8.7 GtCO2 yr−1) depending largely on future renewable energy capacity and annual geological storage injection rates. Bioenergy with CCS deployment remains severely constrained by available land, as the median falls from 1.8 to 0.3 GtCO2 yr−1 in land-constrained scenarios, but gains portfolio share when future energy availability is bounded. Our simulations also reveal that ocean alkalinisation could become a dominant solution in high removal scenarios. Evaluating the performance of portfolios beyond economic costs, we also provide a framework to explore trade-offs across different aspects relevant to planetary boundaries."

It is critical to evaluate the impacts of CDHW and assess global socio-economic risks to formulate appropriate risk mitigation strategies. Most studies have focused on projecting the likely variation in the multidimensional hazard of CDHW. However, the discrepancies among global population projection datasets based on shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) and their potential impacts on disaster risk assessments remain underexplored. In this study, multiple global high-resolution population projection datasets are used in combination with projected CDHW hazards via the multimodel ensemble from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) to investigate how different sources of population data could affect the assessment of CDHW-exposed populations under SSPs. The results show that at the global scale, the spatial pattern and temporal evolution of the CDHW-exposed population under climate change can be depicted consistently on the basis of different population data. However, at the subcontinental scale, substantial spatial heterogeneity exists in the projected exposure. For regions such as the Mediterranean, South Asia, and western Central Asia, the projections from different datasets are consistent with low uncertainty. In contrast, for regions including the northern hemisphere above 40°N, Oceania, eastern Central Asia, East Asia, the South American monsoon region, western Africa, Central Africa, etc., the uncertainty in the estimated exposed population is higher and is expected to increase from the 2020s to the end of the 21st century. Additional locational socioeconomic data should be collected in these areas to reduce uncertainty in future socioeconomic projections. The findings highlight the critical need to consider different elements-at-risk and choose fit-for-purpose datasets, providing essential guidance for disaster risk assessments that support climate adaptation strategies and sustainable development goals."

While socio-hydrology offers a conceptual framework emphasizing the equal importance of social and hydrological processes in water management outcomes, the relative significance of each may vary depending on the specific context, water users’ perspectives, and their particular needs. To study these relationships, we applied the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework (SLF) to explore how livelihood assets of water user groups affect their water security in the headwaters of Cusco, Peru. We surveyed 154 residents about their perceptions of their natural, physical, social, human, and financial assets, alongside external influences like climate change and water legislation. We found that while water infrastructure (physical asset) is critical for water access, it does not ensure water security. Robust social assets are essential, as well as contributions from other assets. Furthermore, our results indicate that water user profiles (e.g. domestic water users or farmers) explain better the variability in water-related livelihood assets than geographical location or altitude. Using the SLF approach, we were able to identify the unique water-related needs, priorities, and challenges faced by each water user group. Therefore, water management in high mountain areas may pass through holistic community engagement and the strengthening of diverse assets—especially social ones—which can be achieved and included in policy frameworks aimed at sustainable water management and equitable water access. This would enable mountain communities to be better equipped to handle environmental and economic changes, moving towards more resilient and inclusive water security solutions."

Current resilience studies in the Amazon rely on passive and active remote sensing forest cover metrics that offer limited insight into nuanced forest canopy structural changes associated with degradation. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) spaceborne lidar provides detailed information on canopy structure, a key factor in forest recovery, resilience, and ability to provide ecosystem services. We evaluate GEDI spaceborne lidar’s capability to characterise forest structure along a gradient of degradation (e.g. primary unburned (PU), secondary recovering, fire frequency), and investigate the potential of quantifying forest structure to advance understanding of forest responses to disturbance across the Amazon. We assess the correspondence of GEDI structural metrics such as relative height (RH) and canopy cover to airborne lidar metrics across the Brazilian Amazon using Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). We evaluate GEDI forest structure variation along a gradient of forest degradation. We explore the potential of principal component (PC) analysis applied to GEDI data to derive a continuous descriptor of forest structural state that characterises the forest degradation continuum, and use a multinomial logistic regression model (MNLR) to further evaluate this descriptor. The strongest positive correspondence for all sampled GEDI and airborne lidar footprints occurs at RH96 (CCC; 0.57) of the canopy height profile, with strongest agreement in primary forest burned at least three times (CCC; 0.91). Whilst canopy cover showed significant recovery 15–25 years after disturbance, forest canopy height and aboveground biomass density had not fully recovered to pre-disturbance levels within 38 years. The PCA identified the importance of RH75, RH96, foliage height diversity index and canopy directional gap probability, with PC1 and PC2 explaining 80% and 15% of variance, respectively. The MNLR suggests that the ratio of these PCs effectively characterises the forest degradation gradient. We demonstrate the ability of GEDI 2A/B structural metrics to differentiate forest structure along a gradient of PU to secondary severely degraded forest in the Amazon rainforest, despite some overlap in structural characterisations between similar degradation classes. Our new method for deriving a forest structural state metric supports future research on forest monitoring, conservation, and the study of Amazon-wide ecosystem resilience."

This study aimed to optimize the freight structure in China and to develop a low-carbon freight transportation system. As one of the main factors influencing freight CEs, research on the freight structure is helpful for understanding the comparative advantages and potential environmental impacts of various freight transportation modes. The freight structure was characterized by calculating the proportion of the freight turnover of four transportation modes, and the mechanism of the influence of the freight structure on freight CEs was examined by combining the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology model and geographically and temporally weighted regression model. It is worth noting that from 2005 to 2023, the transport carbon intensity (CEI) has decreased significantly in some provinces, such as Beijing and Tianjin Province, by 22.94% and 75.49%, respectively. But freight costs in both Hebei and Gansu have risen by more than 65%. Nevertheless, the overall freight CEI in China has decreased by approximately 25.69% over the past 15 years due to freight transportation mode and technology advancements.

This study used data from the largest polar expedition in history, MOSAiC, and the CERES satellite to analyse the impact of clouds on radiation. Simulations showed accurate results, aligning with observations. Over the year, clouds caused the atmospheric surface system to lose 5.2 W m−² of radiative energy to space, while the surface gained 25 W m−² and the atmosphere cooled by 30.2 W m−². 
 An accurate representation of the radiation budget is essential for investigating the impact of clouds on the climate system, especially in the Arctic, an environment highly sensitive to complex and rapid environmental changes. In this study, we analyse a unique dataset of observations from the central Arctic made during the MOSAiC (Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate) expedition in conjunction with state-of-the-art satellite products from CERES (Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System) to investigate the radiative effect of clouds and radiative closure at the surface and the top of the atmosphere (TOA). We perform a series of radiative transfer simulations using derived cloud macro- and microphysical properties as inputs to the simulations for the entire MOSAiC period, comparing our results to collocated satellite products and ice-floe observations. The radiative closure biases were generally within the instrumental uncertainty, indicating that the simulations are sufficiently accurate to reproduce the radiation budget during MOSAiC. Comparisons of the simulated radiation budget relative to CERES show similar values in the terrestrial flux but relatively large differences in the solar flux, which are attributed to a lower surface albedo and a possible underestimation of atmospheric opacity by CERES. While the simulation results were consistent with the observations, more detailed analyses reveal an overestimation of simulated cloud opacity for cases involving geometrically thick ice clouds. In the annual mean, we found that, during the MOSAiC expedition, the presence of clouds leads to a loss of 5.2 W m−2 of the atmosphere–surface system to space, while the surface gains 25.0 W m−2 and the atmosphere is cooled by 30.2 W m−2."

DCESS II is designed for global simulations over timescales of years to millions of years using limited computer resources like a personal computer. With its flexibility and comprehensive treatment of the global carbon cycle, DCESS II is a useful, computationally friendly tool for simulations of past climates as well as for future Earth system projections. 
 A new Earth system model of intermediate complexity, DCESS II, is presented that builds upon, improves and extends the Danish Center for Earth System Science (DCESS) Earth system model (DCESS I). DCESS II has considerably greater spatial resolution than DCESS I while retaining the fine, 100 m vertical resolution in the ocean. It contains modules for the atmosphere, ocean, ocean sediment, land biosphere and lithosphere and is designed to deal with global change simulations on scales of years to millions of years while using limited computational resources. Tracers of the atmospheric module are temperature, nitrous oxide, methane (12,13C isotopes), carbon dioxide (12,13,14C isotopes) and atmospheric oxygen. For the ocean module, tracers are conservative temperature, absolute salinity, water 18O, phosphate, dissolved inorganic carbon (12,13,14C isotopes), alkalinity and dissolved oxygen. Furthermore, the ocean module considers simplified dynamical schemes for large-scale meridional circulation and sea ice dynamics, stratification-dependent vertical diffusion, a gravity current approach to the formation of Antarctic Bottom Water, and improvements in ocean biogeochemistry. DCESS II has two hemispheres with six zonally averaged atmospheric boxes and 12 ocean sectors distributed across the Indian–Pacific, the Atlantic, the Arctic and the Southern oceans. A new extended land biosphere scheme is implemented that considers three different vegetation types whereby net primary production depends on sunlight and atmospheric carbon dioxide. The ocean sediment and lithosphere model formulations are adopted from DCESS I but now applied to the multiple ocean and land regions of the new model.Model calibration was carried out for the pre-industrial climate, and model steady-state solutions were compared against available modern-day observations. For the most part, calibration results agree well with observed data, including excellent agreement with ocean carbon species. This serves to demonstrate model utility for dealing with the global carbon cycle. Finally, two idealized experiments were carried out in order to explore model performance. First, we forced the model by varying Ekman transport out of the model Southern Ocean, mimicking the effect of Southern Hemisphere westerly wind variations, and second, we imposed freshwater melting pulses from the Antarctic ice sheet on the model Southern Ocean shelf. Changes in ocean circulation and in the global carbon cycle found in these experiments are in line with results from much more complex models. Thus, we find DCESS II to be a useful and computationally friendly tool for simulations of past climates as well as for future Earth system projections."

CNit effectively reproduced the global carbon–nitrogen cycle dynamics observed in complex models. Our results show persistent nitrogen limitations on plant growth (net primary production) from 1850 to 2100, suggesting that nitrogen deficiency may constrain future land carbon sequestration. 
 The integration of a nitrogen cycle represents a recent advancement in Earth system models (ESMs). However, diverse formulations introduce uncertainty in the nitrogen effect on the carbon cycle, leaving the global carbon–nitrogen coupling effect unclear. In this study, we present CNit v1.0, a newly developed carbon–nitrogen cycle model designed for integration with MAGICC (Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change), a widely used reduced-complexity model. CNit v1.0 has been calibrated to two land surface models (CABLE and OCN) and (the land component of) a set of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) ESMs. CNit v1.0 is able to capture the dynamics of the more complex models' carbon–nitrogen cycle at the global-mean, annual scale. The emulation results suggest a consistent nitrogen limitation on net primary production (NPP) in CMIP6 ESMs, persisting throughout the simulations (i.e., over the period 1850–2100) in most models. The emulation provides a way to disentangle diverse nitrogen effects on carbon pool turnovers in CMIP6 ESMs, with our results suggesting that nitrogen deficiency generally inhibits litter production and decomposition while enhancing soil respiration (from a multi-model mean perspective). However, this disentanglement is limited due to a lack of simulations from CMIP6 ESMs which would allow us to fully separate the nitrogen and carbon responses. The results imply a potential reduction in land carbon sequestration in the future due to nitrogen deficiency. Future studies will use CNit to further investigate the carbon–nitrogen coupling effect, including uncertainty, in future climate projections."

However, the diverse molecular scenarios of groundwater DOM under uneven recharging levels remain largely unexplored. We combined molecular characteristics, carbon isotopic signatures of organic molecules, and end-member mixing analysis to explore the sensitivity and potential tracking capabilities of DOM to AGR along with recharging gradients. Our findings suggested that AGR enriched groundwater with diverse, saturated, labile, and sulfur-rich molecules, amplifying DOM abundance and intensity, which intensified with recharge gradients. Additionally, S-containing molecules and their indicators like CHOS% (with threshold values of 7.82%) exhibited high sensitivity and predictive power for AGR recognition. The major signatures (diversity, saturated degree, and stability) indicated by 13C-containing molecules were similar to the whole molecular pool. Notably, specific molecules (C12H10O5S and C15H16O12), although not detected in all groundwater samples, exhibit robust stability or favorable solubility, rendering them potential candidates as AGR-sensitive molecules. The R13C/12C ratio of 13C-containing C19H24O5 emerged as the most robust tracer, exhibiting a strong correlation with the recharge ratio and the smallest deviation from the theoretical mixing line, signifying its optimal suitability for precise groundwater DOM source apportionment. This study offers novel insights into AGR impacts and contributes to fostering a harmonious balance between human activities and water resource sustainability."

Soil serves as a long-term source of PFAS for the adjacent groundwater and surface water, but the lack of extractable organofluorine (EOF) mass balance data in the AFFF-impacted soils may lead to an underestimation of PFAS contamination. This study analyzed ten surface soil samples from three AFFF-impacted sites in Sweden, using alkaline extraction followed by acidic extraction. The alkaline and acidic fractions were subjected to further cleanup and analyzed separately for target, suspect screening, and EOF analysis to evaluate the extraction efficiencies of different PFAS in the soil samples and reveal PFAS remaining unknown in the AFFF-impacted soils. Total target PFAS concentrations ranged from 33.0 to 2.40 × 104 ng/g dry weight. Thirty-six PFAS were identified using suspect screening. Considerable amounts of zwitterionic and cationic PFAS (up to 58%) were identified in the acidic extraction fraction, while >95% of anionic PFAS were found in the alkaline extraction fraction. EOF mass balance analysis was conducted on AFFF-impacted soils for the first time. The high proportion of unexplained organofluorine (up to 65%) indicated the necessity for future investigation of the unknown PFAS in AFFF-impacted soils to comprehensively understand their fate and risk."

Microbial reductive dehalogenation plays crucial roles in attenuating PCBs, but comprehensive insights into PCB dechlorination pathways, reactivity, and governing factors are limited by the vast number of congeners and costly experimental approaches. We address this challenge by establishing a high-throughput in vitro assay approach of reductive dehalogenation (HINVARD), which increases dechlorination test throughput by 30-fold and enhances reagents and cell utilization efficiency by over 10-fold compared to conventional assay methods. Using HINVARD, we screened 61 PCB congeners across 9 enrichment cultures and 3 Dehalococcoides isolates, identifying active dechlorination of 31–44 congeners. Results showed that PCB congener properties (chlorine substitution patterns, steric hindrance, and solubility) primarily determine the dechlorination potential, leading to consistent reactivity trends across cultures. In contrast, different organohalide-respiring bacteria catalyzed distinct dechlorination pathways, preferentially removing para- or meta-chlorines. Structural modeling of reductive dehalogenases revealed unique binding orientations governing substrate specificity, offering molecular insights into these pathways. This study provides a high-efficiency strategy for investigating microbial reductive dehalogenation, yielding the first comprehensive understanding of PCB dechlorination patterns and mechanisms.

Utility was demonstrated by applying it to five types of microenvironments where the 13 OPEs were ubiquitous (indoor dust: 993–14000 ng/g; indoor air: 0.549–14.1 ng/m3). The paired dust and air samples were adopted to construct the “Measured-Paired-EICs” data set for source apportionments via positive matrix factorization (PMF). Moreover, an alternative model method for constructing EIC data sets from single-medium measurements was established to improve the applicability of the framework. Accordingly, “Modeled-Paired-EICs”, “Dust-Only”, and “Air-Only” data sets were constructed for comparison. The extracted factors exhibited consistent contributions for “Measured-Paired-EICs” and “Modeled-Paired-EICs” solutions (RSD: 0.14–5.4%), while the “Air-Only” solution identified incomplete factors and the “Dust-Only” solution showed errors of 40.6–262%.

Apatite minerals serve as a key P reservoir, yet their dissolution mechanisms at the microscale remain poorly understood due to technical limitations in directly observing mineral–solution interfaces. Here, we demonstrate an innovative dual-imaging approach that combines fluorescence-based pH monitoring with diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) to visualize apatite dissolution dynamics at a submillimeter resolution. Using the pH-sensitive fluorescent probe HPTS, we revealed distinct spatial patterns of pH increase at the apatite–solution interface after 2.5 h exposure in acidic solution (pH 6.0), with the highest pH observed within a 70 μm interfacial layer. Concurrent DGT measurements showed P release peaked at 0.15 ng cm–2 s–1 at the interface, with radial diffusion patterns indicating reaction hotspots.

Particle number concentrations in exhaust plumes of turbofan jet engines, which are commonly used in civil aviation, are generally dominated by volatile particles (sulfates or organics) rather than nonvolatile particles (mostly soot). However, the mechanism of emission and formation of volatile particles are unclear. Here, we evaluated the exhaust particles from turbofan engines at the engine exit and downstream. In downstream samples, the number of soot particles with scattering-layered graphene-like structures, typically generated by combustion, was <1% of the total number of particles analyzed.

The effectiveness of this convention is evaluated by global atmospheric Hg monitoring among other indicators. However, it is uncertain to directly link anthropogenic Hg emissions to atmospheric Hg concentrations mainly due to legacy Hg re-emissions. Here, we reconstructed the past atmospheric Hg concentrations and isotope compositions using the annually resolved (1982–2020) leaves of Androsace tapete at Mt. Everest, Tibetan Plateau. Our reconstruction indicates that the atmospheric Hg concentrations increased from the early 1980s to 2002 (3.31 ng m–3), followed by a large (∼70%) decline until 2020 (0.90 ng m–3). The declining trend of atmospheric Hg concentrations resembles those observed at North Hemisphere background sites, particularly in Chinese rural areas. Notably, there has been an increasing enrichment of light isotopes in atmospheric Hg over the past decade. Using an isotope mixing model based on δ202Hg, we show that the atmospheric Hg has declined over the past decade that is mainly driven by reduced anthropogenic emissions. The contributions of the terrestrial legacy re-emissions are rather stable, but their atmospheric fractions increased from ∼44% in 2010 to ∼62% in 2020.

However, the effects of channel dynamics on blue carbon fluxes remain unclear. Analyses of abandoned tidal channels in the Venice Lagoon (Italy) demonstrate that they take up organic carbon at significantly faster rates than neighboring marshes. This is because, despite slightly lower sediment carbon density, abandoned tidal channels yield significantly higher rates of sediment vertical accretion owing to topographic accommodation and reduced flow velocities, which facilitate the deposition of particulate matter and debris. We estimate that abandoned tidal channels in Venice capture 17 tons of carbon annually, equivalent to 21 ha of marshes, despite covering only 3.5 ha in total.

The sensible heat flux decrease is less pronounced than the latent heat flux increase, mainly because of the insulating effect, which prevented evaporative cooling reduction. This study advances our understanding of the mechanisms by which large‐scale water diversion affects WRA climates."

Traditional methods, such as time of arrival algorithms, rely on precise arrival time picking, which can compromise localization accuracy. Conversely, time reversal (TR) algorithms bypass picking but are hindered by time‐consuming grid search requirements. We propose a graph neural network (GNN) based method for accurate, real‐time multi‐station lightning location. Our approach processes continuous lightning waveform data from multiple sensors, achieving simultaneous denoising, event detection, and direct localization without arrival time picking. Specifically, denoising enhances the signal‐to‐noise ratio, thereby improving the accuracy of subsequent event detection and localization. Events are identified by matching signals across sensors and retaining high‐match segments, resulting in waveforms that contain valid lightning signals. These waveforms are then input into a GNN, which integrates time series features with spatial information from the sensors, effectively handling multi‐station localization and delivering accurate, real‐time results. To address the lack of training data sets for lightning location, we propose a novel procedure for constructing a labeled lightning data set, laying a data foundation for future data‐driven approaches in this domain. In extensive synthetic experiments, our method achieved a low average localization error of 0.61 km and high efficiency with a localization time of only 0.4 milliseconds, significantly outperforming the traditional TR algorithm's 1.16 km error and 1.65 s. When tested on natural cloud‐to‐ground lightning data, our method successfully detected and located 198 lightning sources consistent with reference results."

Past decades have seen the rapid economic development and air quality improvement in China, but the changes in interprovincial pollution transfers and the related inequalities are still unclear. Our results show that from 2007 to 2017, Chinese domestic consumption drives the national value added to rise steadily from 2.1 to 6.8 billion RMB, while the corresponding emissions first to increase from 46.6 Tg in 2007 to 51.2 Tg in 2012, and then to fall sharply to 29.9 Tg in 2017. Consumption in the sector construction contributes most to the emissions with the proportion of contribution increasing during the studied decade. Eastern provinces, as environmental‐economic beneficiaries, tend to see net emission inflows, and the east‐to‐west emission transfer is substantially reduced by 2/3 during 2007–2017. In contrast, the number of Western provinces suffering from environmental‐economic loss has decreased, and some even transform into achieving environmental‐economic win. Greener production is the dominant factor of the reduced emission flow, resulting in the alleviated regional environmental‐economic inequalities. For further air quality improvement and regional inequality alleviation in China, we suggest improving pollution responsibility sharing mechanism and strengthening regional cooperation on pollution mitigation."

Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and severity of climate extremes, potentially impacting the duration and magnitude of future influenza epidemics. However, the extent of these projected effects on influenza outbreaks remains understudied. Here, we use an epidemiologic model adapted for temperate and tropical climates to explore how climate variability may affect seasonal influenza. Using climate anomalies derived from historical data, we found that simulated periods of anomalous climate conditions impacted both the projected influenza outbreak peak size and the total proportion infected, with the strongest effects observed when the anomaly was included just before the typical peak. Effects varied by climate: temperate regions showed a unimodal relationship, while tropical climates exhibited a nonlinear pattern. Our results emphasize that the intensity of weather extremes is key to understanding how climate change may affect influenza outbreaks, laying the groundwork for utilizing weather variability as a potential early warning for influenza activity."

 Periodic sediment patterns have been observed on Earth in riverbeds and sand and snow deserts, but also in other planetary environments. One of the most ubiquitous patterns, familiar wind or ‘impact’ ripples, adorns sand beaches and arid regions on Earth. The observation of aeolian impact ripples on Mars the same size as their terrestrial counterparts despite a thinner atmosphere raises questions about their formation. Here we show in a numerical simulation that the emergent wavelength of impact ripples is controlled by the mechanics of grain–bed impacts and not the characteristic trajectories of grains above the bed. We find that the distribution of grain trajectories in transport is essentially scale-free, invoking the proximity of a critical point and precluding a transport-related length scale that selects ripple wavelengths. By contrast, when a grain strikes the bed, the process leading to grain ejections introduces a collective granular length scale that determines the scale of the ripples. We propose a theoretical model that predicts a relatively constant ripple size for most planetary conditions. In addition, our model predicts that for high-density atmospheres, such as on Venus, or for sufficiently large sand grains on Earth, impact ripples propagate upwind. Although wind-tunnel and field experiments are needed to confirm the existence of such ‘antiripples’, we suggest that our quantitative model of wind-blown sediment transport may be used to deduce geological and environmental conditions on other planets from the sizes and propagation speeds of impact ripples. Numerical simulations suggest the wavelength of wind ripples is controlled by the mechanics of grain–bed impacts, not grain hop length, explaining why ripples on Mars and Earth are the same scale despite very different atmospheric conditions."

This paper shows how PACT prevents aberrant PKR activation by endogenous dsRNAs like Alu. PACT disrupts PKR’s dsRNA scanning without blocking its binding, resetting its activation threshold to tolerate cellular dsRNA and preserve homeostasis. 
 The innate immune sensor PKR for double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is critical for antiviral defense, but its aberrant activation by cellular dsRNA is linked to various diseases. The dsRNA-binding protein PACT plays a critical yet controversial role in this pathway. We show that PACT directly suppresses PKR activation by endogenous dsRNA ligands, such as inverted-repeat Alu RNAs, which robustly activate PKR in the absence of PACT. Instead of competing for dsRNA binding, PACT prevents PKR from scanning along dsRNA—a necessary step for PKR molecules to encounter and phosphorylate each other for activation. While PKR favors longer dsRNA for increased co-occupancy and scanning-mediated activation, longer dsRNA is also more susceptible to PACT-mediated regulation due to increased PACT-PKR co-occupancy. Unlike viral inhibitors that constitutively suppress PKR, this RNA-dependent mechanism allows PACT to fine-tune PKR activation based on dsRNA length and quantity, ensuring self-tolerance without sequestering most cellular dsRNA. The antiviral dsRNA sensor PKR is regulated by PACT. This paper shows how PACT prevents aberrant PKR activation by endogenous dsRNAs like Alu.

This manuscript documents an approach to estimate the economic impacts of widespread, long duration (WLD) power interruptions. 
 We partnered with a utility in the U.S. state of Illinois to develop and pilot an approach to estimate the economic impacts of widespread, long duration (WLD) power interruptions. We surveyed their customers about hypothetical blackouts, identifying and classifying mitigating/resilience behaviors and quantifying their costs and benefits. Survey results are scaled up to the broader regional economy, and used to drive a computational general equilibrium (CGE) simulation of the effects of power interruptions and attendant customer responses (e.g., relocation, backup generation). Impacts are severe: 1-, 3-, and 14-day interruptions reduce the utility service area’s three-month GDP by $1.8 Bn (1.3%), $3.7 Bn (2.6%) and $15.2 Bn (10.4%), respectively, with losses driven overwhelmingly by disequilibrium responses to shortages as opposed to price signals (71%–88%). Doubling backup power penetration moderates GDP losses by 11%–14%, and is relatively least beneficial during the longest interruption duration. Results highlight previously unquantified economic losses that can potentially be avoided by investments in power system resilience.

Scheer,Daytime eating during simulated night work&#xa0;mitigates changes in cardiovascular risk factors: secondary analyses of a randomized controlled trial,"Circadian misalignment, which typically occurs in shift work, associates with cardiovascular diseases. Here the authors report that eating only in the daytime during simulated night work mitigates adverse changes in cardiovascular risk factors (including autonomic cardiac control, prothrombotic factor, and blood pressure) in a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial. 
 Effective countermeasures against the adverse cardiovascular effects of circadian misalignment, such as effects experienced due to night work or jet lag, remain to be established in humans. Here, we aim to test whether eating only during daytime can mitigate such adverse effects vs. eating during the night and day (typical for night shift workers) under simulated night work (secondary analysis of NCT02291952). This single-blind, parallel-arm trial randomized 20 healthy participants (non-shift workers) to simulated night work with meals consumed during night and day (Nighttime Meal Control Group) or only during daytime (Daytime Meal Intervention Group). The primary outcomes were pNN50 (percentage consecutive heartbeat intervals >50 ms), RMSSD (root mean square of successive heartbeat differences), and LF/HF (low/high cardiac frequency). The secondary outcome was blood concentrations of prothrombotic factor plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). These measures were assessed under Constant Routine conditions, before (baseline) and after (postmisalignment) simulated night work. The meal timing intervention significantly modified the impact of simulated night work on cardiac vagal modulation and PAI-1 (pFDR = 0.001). In the Control Group, the postmisalignment Constant Routine showed a decrease in pNN50 by 25.7% (pFDR = 0.008) and RMMSD by 14.3% (pFDR = 0.02), and an increase in LF/HF by 5.5% (pFDR = 0.04) and PAI-1 by 23.9% (pFDR = 0.04), vs. the baseline Constant Routine. In the Intervention Group, there were no significant changes in these outcomes. For exploratory outcomes, the intervention significantly modified the impact of simulated night work on blood pressure (P < 0.05), with no significant change in the Control Group, and a significant reduction by 6-8% (P < 0.01) in the Intervention Group; without significant effects for heart rate or cortisol. These findings indicate that daytime eating, despite mistimed sleep, may mitigate changes in cardiovascular risk factors and offer translational evidence for developing a behavioral strategy to help minimize the adverse changes in cardiovascular risk factors in individuals exposed to circadian misalignment, such as shift workers. Circadian misalignment, which typically occurs in shift work, associates with cardiovascular diseases. Here the authors report that eating only in the daytime during simulated night work mitigates adverse changes in cardiovascular risk factors (including autonomic cardiac control, prothrombotic factor, and blood pressure) in a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial."

 αβ T cell receptors (TCR) co-recognise peptide (p) antigens that are presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. While marked variations in TCR-p-MHC docking topologies have been observed from structural studies, the co-recognition paradigm has held fast. Using HLA-DQ2.5-peptide tetramers, here we identify a TRAV12-1+-TRBV5-1+ G9 TCR from human peripheral blood that binds HLA-DQ2.5 in a peptide-agnostic manner. The crystal structures of TCR-HLA-DQ2.5-peptide complexes show that the G9 TCR binds HLA-DQ2.5 in a reversed docking topology without contacting the peptide, with the TCR contacting the β1 region of HLA-DQ2.5 and distal from the peptide antigen binding cleft. High-throughput screening of HLA class I and II molecules finds the G9 TCR to be pan-HLA-DQ2 reactive, with leucine-55 of HLA-DQ2.5 being a key determinant underpinning G9 TCR specificity excluding other HLA-II allomorphs. Consistent with the functional assays, the interactions of the G9 TCR and HLA-DQ2.5 precludes CD4 binding, thereby impeding T cell activation. Collectively, we describe a naturally selected αβTCR from human peripheral blood that deviates from the TCR-p-MHC co-recognition paradigm.

Here, the authors examine sedimentary DNA from fish parasites in Lake Redon, suggesting fish were introduced by Late-Roman or Visigoths in the 7th century. 
 High-mountain lakes were historically fishless due to natural barriers, but human introductions have led to widespread fish presence. Although particularly intensive during the last decades, historical documents indicate introductions in European high mountains already during the 14th and 15th centuries, but they could have occurred before, provided the intensive land use of the high mountain had started earlier. We used ancient environmental DNA from lake sediments (sedDNA) to investigate this hypothesis. Fish ectoparasites from various clades were identified using the 18S rRNA gene in the sediment record of a deep, high-mountain Pyrenean lake, with Ichthyobodo (Kinetoplastea) being of particular interest due to its consistent occurrence. The study shows a continued presence of fish parasites in the lake since the 7th century, which coincides with the Late-Roman and Visigothic extensive mountain use for sheep pasturing as supported by nearby archeological remains and increased lake primary production evidenced by photosynthetic pigments.

Here, the authors introduce MSFragger-DDA+, a database search tool that enhances peptide identification by searching the full isolation window, improving sensitivity and maintaining strict false discovery rate control. 
 Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry based proteomics, particularly in the bottom-up approach, relies on the digestion of proteins into peptides for subsequent separation and analysis. The most prevalent method for identifying peptides from data-dependent acquisition mass spectrometry data is database search. Traditional tools typically focus on identifying a single peptide per tandem mass spectrum, often neglecting the frequent occurrence of peptide co-fragmentations leading to chimeric spectra. Here, we introduce MSFragger-DDA+, a database search algorithm that enhances peptide identification by detecting co-fragmented peptides with high sensitivity and speed. Utilizing MSFragger’s fragment ion indexing algorithm, MSFragger-DDA+ performs a comprehensive search within the full isolation window for each tandem mass spectrum, followed by robust feature detection, filtering, and rescoring procedures to refine search results. Evaluation against established tools across diverse datasets demonstrated that, integrated within the FragPipe computational platform, MSFragger-DDA+ significantly increases identification sensitivity while maintaining stringent false discovery rate control. It is also uniquely suited for wide-window acquisition data. MSFragger-DDA+ provides an efficient and accurate solution for peptide identification, enhancing the detection of low-abundance co-fragmented peptides. Coupled with the FragPipe platform, MSFragger-DDA+ enables more comprehensive and accurate analysis of proteomics data. Proteomics often misses co-fragmented peptides in DDA data.

Here, authors show that high-entropy alloys can enhance the oxygen evolution reaction by activating the lattice oxygen mechanism through multi-path electron transfer, particularly in nickel. 
 Electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is key to several energy technologies but suffers from low activity. Leveraging the lattice oxygen activation mechanism (LOM) is a strategy for boosting its activity. However, this approach faces significant thermodynamic challenges, requiring high-valent oxidation of metal ions without compromising their stability. We reveal that high-entropy alloys (HEAs) can efficiently activate the LOM through synergistic multi-path electron transfer. Specifically, the oxidation of nickel is enhanced by this electron transfer, aided by the integration of weaker Co-O bonds, enabling effective LOM at the Ni-Co dual-site. These insights allow the design of a NiFeCoCrW0.2 HEA that exhibits improved activity, achieving an overpotential of 220 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. It also demonstrates good stability, maintaining the potential with less than 5% variation over 90 days at 100 mA cm−2 current density. This study sheds light on the synergistic effects that confer high activity in HEAs and contribute to the advancement of high-performance OER electrocatalysts.

 Accurate detection of nostril airflow is vital for real-time respiratory monitoring. However, the developed methods only rely on single stimulus sensing for nostril airflow, which is extremely susceptible to interference in the complex environment, and severely affects the accuracy of detection results. Here, a multimodal integrated eutectogel sensor is explored to simultaneously sense the pressure and temperature stimuli of nostril airflow, by independently outputting capacitance and resistance, respectively, without cross-coupling. The completely physical crosslinking and the synergistic interaction of hydroxyapatite and tannic acid within the network endow this eutectogel with extremely low modulus, remarkable self-healing efficiency, robust adhesion, good environmental stability, and bio-compatibility. A multimodal sensor is developed by integrating this synthetic eutectogel with circuit design, which exhibits superior pressure sensitivity compared to other reported gel-based sensors. As a proof of concept, this sensor is further explored to diagnose the traditional respiratory disease of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome by simultaneously detecting five kinds of stimuli in the sleeping process, greatly improving the accuracy and reliability of the detection results.

Australia and New Zealand exhibited a greater hospitalization risk for asthma associated with wildfire-specific PM2.5.

 The expansion and interconnection of protected areas are central to achieving the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework’s ambitious goals, yet their synergistic relationship remains underexplored. Here, we propose a framework integrating wildlife dispersal-based connectivity to address two key objectives in China: (1) constructing a cost-effective nature conservation network by combining connectivity and biodiversity prioritization, and (2) evaluating climate and anthropogenic risks while addressing habitat representation gaps. The framework aims to designate 30% of land as protected areas and informally allocate additional 30% of land as conservation priority corridors. Results show this strategy connects 57% of existing protected areas, protects 74% of priority zones, and achieves 89% of habitat representation targets. While current protected areas mitigate climate and anthropogenic threats, future expansion faces challenges due to geographic variations in these threats and the necessity for adequate representation. Our approach identifies and prioritizes these challenges, offering a data-driven pathway to achieve Kunming-Montreal targets.

However, the interaction between job matching and emission patterns remains unclear. Here we examine both historical and future trends in this interaction using a global unifying explanation with high-aggregated model. Our findings reveal national-level latitude and wealth effects. In high-latitude regions, 79% of job matching in relatively wealthy nations show a positive correlation with emissions reductions. In contrast, this trend is observed in only 10% of poorer nations located at low latitudes.

 Concurrent climate extremes have severe consequences on societies, economies, and natural systems. Multi-hazard risk-oriented early warning systems are essential to reduce impacts, enhance preparedness, and boost adaptation. Yet, the growing volume and variety of spatio-temporal data combined with the increasing frequency of concurrent extremes pose challenges to the rapid detection and tracking of harmful events. Artificial intelligence offers an opportunity to deal with these challenges, especially when interpretability and explainability are ensured.

Results highlight the added value of expert-driven and explainable artificial intelligence models in supporting risk management as well as effective and sustainable adaptation, particularly when integrated into early warning systems and sectoral climate services.

 Ocean alkalinity enhancement is a potential strategy for gigatonne-scale atmospheric carbon dioxide removal. It uses alkaline substances to convert seawater carbon dioxide into (bi)carbonate, enabling uptake of additional carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. A critical knowledge gap is how ocean alkalinity enhancement could influence marine plankton communities. Here we conducted 19 ship-based experiments in the Equatorial Pacific, examining three prevalent alkaline substances (sodium hydroxide, olivine, and steel slag) and their effects on natural phytoplankton populations under realistic and moderate alkalinity enhancements (16–29 μmol kg−1). Results demonstrate that sodium hydroxide had a negligible effect on phytoplankton while providing predictable alkalinity. Conversely, olivine disrupted plankton, especially cyanobacteria, heterotrophic bacteria, and picoeukaryotes while only providing 0.06 mmol alkalinity g−1 olivine. Steel slag moderately changed phytoplankton communities and fertilized growth while delivering 8 mmol alkalinity g−1 slag.

10.1016/j.atmosenv.2025.121208,True,Atmospheric Environment,该研究论文利用卫星观测数据（特别是OMI的NO2和HCHO数据）来推断美国本土近地面臭氧的生成机制。研究比较了卫星观测和空气质量模型CAMx的模拟结果，分析了不同地区和时间段（包括一天中的不同时段）臭氧生成机制的差异，尤其关注了行星边界层内的臭氧生成情况。研究结果表明，卫星观测的柱浓度比值可能无法准确反映近地面臭氧的生成机制，并强调了在基于卫星数据制定空气质量政策时，需要考虑地表臭氧生成机制的日变化。此外，论文还提到了未来TEMPO卫星数据在政策制定中的应用前景。整体而言，该论文与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，涉及空气质量监测、卫星观测、大气成分分析等多个方面。,"['air quality monitoring', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'ozone production', 'nitrogen dioxide', 'formaldehyde', 'OMI', 'TEMPO', 'planetary boundary layer', 'NOx', 'VOCs']",Akanksha Singh;Allison M. Ring;Hao He;Dale J. Allen;Russell R. Dickerson;Ross J. Salawitch;Timothy P. Canty,Inferring near-surface ozone production regimes: Insights from using satellite retrievals over the contiguous US,"•Developed a metricβthat highlights regions where satellite observations may not accurately indicate near-surface ozone production. •Ozone production within the planetary boundary layer tends to be more VOC-limited than the tropospheric column indicates. •In the morning within the PBL, ozone production is in a VOC-limited regime and shifts to a NOx-limited regime in the afternoon. •While regional ozone pollution responds well to NOxcontrols, we identify locations and times to prioritize VOC controls. 
 Surface ozone regulation policies rely heavily on air quality models, such as CAMx, for guidance. Comparison with observations is crucial to evaluating a model's ability to represent ozone production chemistry. Identifying factors influencing surface ozone formation is complicated because ozone photochemical production rates are non-linearly dependent on concentrations of precursors such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). We compare ozone production regimes (OPRs) identified from satellite observations and model simulations, as defined by the ratio of column formaldehyde to nitrogen dioxide (FNR, HCHO/NO2). We performed CAMx simulations for summer 2016 over the Contiguous United States (CONUS) and compared output against two OMI NO2 and HCHO retrievals. Our analysis spans diurnal and altitudinal variations of OPRs, offering important insights for effective policy formulation. At the time of the OMI overpass oz(∼1:30 p.m. LT), OPR is NOx-limited over most of the CONUS, as determined from OMI column ratios. Analysis of CAMx column ratios shows similar results. In contrast, more regions are VOC-limited when we constrain our ratio to within the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL). In the morning (∼9 a.m. LT), the CAMx PBL column ratios shift towards VOC-limited regime compared to the afternoon. We highlight areas of the CONUS where satellite measurements of FNR may not be an accurate indicator of near-surface OPRs. Air quality regulations based on satellite observations should consider the diurnal variations of surface OPRs and assess how well their ratios represent near-surface OPR. Our results have implications for interpretation of TEMPO data for policy relevant applications."
10.1016/j.atmosenv.2025.121221,True,Atmospheric Environment,该研究论文主要探讨了过去和未来情景下中国大气无机氮沉降的变化趋势及其驱动因素。研究结合观测数据和模型模拟，分析了2013-2022年间中国大气无机氮沉降的下降趋势，并预测了未来SSP245和SSP585情景下的沉降变化。研究结果表明，排放变化和降水减少是导致近期氮沉降下降的主要原因，且未来排放减少将主导氮沉降的下降趋势。虽然该研究没有直接提及遥感技术或卫星观测，但它对大气成分（特别是氮化合物）的分析，以及对排放和气候变化影响的评估，与大气环境遥感在空气质量监测和大气成分分析方面的应用密切相关。气候化学耦合模拟也常用于遥感数据的验证和补充。,"['atmospheric nitrogen deposition', 'emission changes', 'precipitation', 'air quality', 'atmospheric composition', 'climate-chemistry coupled simulations']",Zihan Zhang;Dan Yan;Mengmeng Li;Yuting Lu;Yiting Zhou;Tijian Wang;Bingliang Zhuang;Shu Li;Xin Huang,Drivers for the trends of atmospheric inorganic nitrogen deposition in China under the past and future scenarios,"•Emission and precipitation contribute comparably to recent nitrogen deposition decline. •Nonlinear nitrate-emission response leads to slower decrease of NOydeposition. •Nitrogen deposition is predicted to decline continuously in the near-future scenarios. 
 Atmospheric inorganic nitrogen deposition has changed dramatically across China over the recent decades, exerting profound impacts on regional climate and ecosystem. Here we present an observation- and model-based analysis to disentangle the trends of atmospheric inorganic nitrogen deposition in China, in response to the emission and climate changes, under the past (2013–2022) and future (2020–2050) scenarios. Both observational evidence and model results indicate an obvious declining trend of the national-average inorganic nitrogen deposition across China from 19.31 kg N ha−1 yr−1 to 14.64 kg N ha−1 yr−1 (−24.2 %) between 2013 and 2022, of which wet and dry deposition declines by −15.8 % and −33.4 %, respectively. Using a series of regional climate-chemistry coupled simulations, we find that the declined inorganic nitrogen deposition in 2013–2022 results comparably from the recent emission changes (69.8 % for oxidized nitrogen and 48.1 % for reduced nitrogen) and precipitation decreases. We further predict a significant decrease in inorganic nitrogen deposition under the SSP245 (−39.18 %) and SSP585 (−47.33 %) scenarios in the near-future. Overall, the contribution of emission reductions surpasses that of climatic changes and dominates the projected declining trends in inorganic nitrogen deposition. This paper provides some important insights into the drivers of atmospheric inorganic deposition in China and lays the foundation for assessing the effectiveness of emission control policies on atmospheric nitrogen deposition reduction."

 Near-surface ozone (O3) is one of the most severe air pollutants in China, particularly over densely populated Jiangsu Province in the Yangtze River Delta. In this study, an O3 source tagging technique is utilized in a chemistry-climate model to quantify the source contributions of various emission sectors and regions for nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to O3 concentrations in Jiangsu Province during 2013–2019. The results show that the near-surface O3 in Jiangsu Province is mainly contributed by surrounding and remote anthropogenic NOx emissions through long-range transport. Local anthropogenic NOx emissions account for only 13 % and 18 % of the annual and summertime mean near-surface O3 in Jiangsu Province, respectively. Anthropogenic NOx emissions from the surface transportation, industry, and energy sectors account for 21 %, 22 % and 20 % of the annual mean near-surface O3 concentration in Jiangsu Province, respectively. Biogenic and anthropogenic VOCs emissions each explains one-third of the annual mean near-surface O3 concentration in Jiangsu, while methane and stratospheric chemical production contribute 21 % and 6 %, respectively. The sources from stratospheric production, aircraft, lightning, and foreign emissions are the primary contributors to O3 in the mid- and high troposphere. During high pollution days in Jiangsu Province, the near-surface O3 concentrations increase with the maximum exceeding 20 ppb, which is attributed to both the enhanced photochemical production and regional transport in favorable meteorological conditions."

 The planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) plays crucial roles in regulating air pollution levels; however, its relationships with PM2.5 (fine particulate matter with diameter ≤ 2.5 μm) under diverse meteorological conditions, as well as potential causes, are not yet well understood. This study leverages approximately three years of satellite/radiosonde derived PBLH to investigate PBLH-PM2.5 relationships under six typical circulation patterns in North China, and some novel physical explanations for the varying PBLH-PM2.5 relationship are proposed. The six circulation patterns are dominated by three high- and three low-pressure systems, with significantly negative PBLH-PM2.5 correlations exhibited in high-pressure patterns, while weak or even insignificant relationships in low-pressure patterns. Meteorological factors, particularly humidity and vertical winds, can largely explain the varying PBLH-PM2.5 relationships across different synoptic patterns. Under high-pressure patterns, elevated PM2.5 aligns well with high humidity within boundary layer, which restricts the magnitude of the PBLH and thus the negative PBLH-PM2.5 correlation. However, under low-pressure patterns, humidity in boundary layer and in free atmosphere exert conflicting effects on PBLH-PM2.5 relationship. Higher PM2.5 is observed when only the boundary layer is moist, whereas when thewhole column is moist or supersaturated, nucleation, transitions, and wet scavenging lead to reduced PM2.5 and lower PBLH, thereby the positive PBLH-PM2.5 correlation. Additionally, the column feature of vertical wind within boundary layer can also help explain the positive PBLH-PM2.5 relationship. These findings provide deeper insights into understanding boundary layer processes and pollution dynamics."
