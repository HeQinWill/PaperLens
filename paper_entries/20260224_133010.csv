By combining lab experiments with real-world data from a mountain site in Italy, we found that the correction factor for this instrument varies mainly due to particle size and measurement conditions. Understanding these influences helps improve air quality monitoring, which is important for assessing pollution impacts on health and climate. 
 The dual-spot aethalometer AE33 is a widely used instrument for measuring the aerosol absorption coefficient, but the accuracy of its measurements is heavily dependent on the multiple scattering correction factor (C), which compensates for multiple scattering effects in the filter matrix. Despite its widespread use, several aspects influencing the variability of C, particularly those related to aerosol microphysical properties, are still not fully constrained.In this work, we explore the variability of C for the AE33 in a wide range of conditions and aerosol properties by combining chamber experiments with freshly emitted laboratory-generated soot and ambient data from a mountaintop site in Italy (Monte Cimone, CMN). The C factor is derived by comparison with independent filter-based instruments such as the MAAP (Multi-Angle Absorption Photometer) and MWAA (Multi-Wavelength Absorption Analyzer) at CMN and the extinction-minus-scattering (EMS) approach in chamber experiments.The mean C value at a wavelength of 637 nm derived at CMN is 2.35 with a standard deviation of 0.58, while the average values obtained in chamber experiments in different conditions range from 2.89 ± 0.03 to 3.9 ± 0.06. The variability of C at CMN appears to be primarily influenced by the signal-to-noise ratio of the instruments, especially during the colder months when absorption coefficient values fall below 1 Mm−1. In contrast, in the chamber experiments, the variability is mainly driven by particle properties. The C value at 637 nm, derived from measurements at CMN, increases with increasing single scattering albedo (SSA), particularly for SSA values above 0.94, while showing no statistically significant spectral variability. Both ambient and chamber experiments highlight the dependence of the C factor on particle size, with C increasing as particle diameter decreases below 200 nm. This size dependence is relatively small (within 25 %) under ambient conditions dominated by mostly scattering aerosols, but it leads to changes greater than 60 % for highly absorbing soot particles. These results are relevant for improving the accuracy and comparability of aerosol absorption measurements performed by aethalometers, particularly within monitoring networks. The observed dependence of C on particle size suggests that differences between urban and remote sites, or between periods dominated by nucleation versus coarse-mode particles (e.g., dust), may contribute to the variability reported across locations. Understanding these dependencies is essential for refining correction approaches and reducing inter-site discrepancies in network datasets."

It identifies 25 sources, including agriculture, wetlands, and fossil fuels, enhancing India’s global data representation. Emissions peak in the Indo-Gangetic Plain and coastal states, highlighting mitigation priorities. Urban emissions are lower, suggesting underestimation. This dataset helps policymakers design targeted reduction strategies, supporting India’s climate goals and global efforts. 
 Methane (CH4) is a predominant climate-forcing agent and has become a focal point of global climate discussions, owing to its significant contribution to atmospheric warming. The ambiguity surrounding the relative contributions of various natural and anthropogenic sources, coupled with associated uncertainties, poses significant challenges to assessing methane emissions in developing nations like India. To address these challenges and better understand the methane-emitting sources, this study presents a comprehensive high-resolution gridded (0.1° × 0.1°) inventory of CH4 emission by including 25 distinct anthropogenic and natural sources in India for 2023 by adopting the IPCC bottom-up approach. The estimated CH4 over India is 37.79 Tg yr−1, which will redefine the contribution of various sources. The agriculture sector contributed ∼50 % followed by wetlands (22.8 %), fossil fuel (8.9 %) and waste management (8.4 %). This study reports the first-ever comprehensive emissions from natural sources like wetlands and termites. The Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and coastal states show elevated emissions with Uttar Pradesh contributing the highest (10.8 %) followed by Gujarat (9.4 %), and Maharashtra (8.6 %). However, surprisingly cities exhibit lower CH4 as compared to other semi-urban/rural regions. This developed dataset can be a valuable input to optimize the climate study by filling the data gap, enabling policymakers to formulate various mitigation measures. The emission dataset can be accessed through the Zenodo repository https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14089138 (Sahu, 2024)."

In the German Baltic Sea, three main dump sites with munition piles exist close to Kiel and Lübeck. This paper presents the first dataset of its kind. It contains information on the munitions and demonstrates that the piles vary significantly among sites. Various maritime uses operate close to the munitions, particularly marine protected areas and sediment dumping. The paper shows that several piles require attention by the authorities. 
 For the first time, this paper presents two datasets that detail the distribution of piles of dumped munitions in the German Baltic Sea (Lübeck Bay and north of Kiel Fjord). Multibeam echosounder data and photomosaics were collected between 2017 and 2024. Dataset A contains basic information on 484 known and potential munition piles and their geographic context, with a focus on maritime activities in their surroundings. Dataset B is a subset of the former, where visual investigation enabled the detailed assessment of 39 munition piles by experts, so that a greater level of detail on the properties of the munitions was collected. The paper contextualises the data in terms of the munitions' properties and their geospatial surroundings. It identifies a ""typical"" munition pile to be inhomogeneous, most likely layered, with partially buried objects and munition casings that are weakly corroded. Munition pile properties were found to differ between dump sites—particularly in terms of the number and size of objects on a pile. Based on the information in datasets A and B, it was possible to extrapolate the number of objects on all (potential) munition piles across Lübeck Bay. The assessment demonstrates that survey data do not match historic recordings in archival documents. Distance measurements reveal that munition piles are located close to protected areas and sediment deposit sites, while subsea cables are located furthest away. The paper identifies six clusters of munition piles, two of which are located in areas with very high traffic density (> 2,000 vessels annually). These data are presented to encourage scientific debate on holistic management strategies, clearance approaches, cost estimates, policy relevance, and prioritisation of remediation activities. The findings show that several munition piles require attention by the respective authorities."

It includes eight meteorological variables and eleven high-impact weather events related to power generation, grid transmission, and electricity demand. CNPS-Met outperforms other existing datasets in accuracy for most meteorological variables. We also quantified the frequency hotspots and intensity extremes of high-impact weather events. 
 The new-type power system exhibits pronounced “weather dependency”, wherein high-impact weather events can significantly exacerbate operational security risks. A high-quality gridded dataset that involves both meteorological variables and high-impact weather events is of great significance for new-type power systems. In this study, a spatially adaptive optimal interpolation scheme is developed and applied to generate the China New-type Power Systems Meteorological (CNPS-Met) dataset. The CNPS-Met dataset spans from 1980 to 2016 and covers the entire Chinese mainland, with a daily temporal resolution and a 25 km spatial resolution. It includes eight meteorological variables and eleven high-impact weather events, categorized from generation-side, grid-side and demand-side perspectives relevant to new-type power systems. Validation with existing datasets indicates that the CNPS-Met dataset generally exhibits superior performance in meteorological estimation. Specifically, the estimated mean relative errors for 2-m air temperature, 2-m specific humidity, 10-m wind speed, precipitation and surface pressure averaged over the Chinese mainland could be reduced by 1.7 %–18.5 %, 9.0 %–29.6 %, 1.9 %–8.5 %, 2.7 %–18 % and 4.9 %–5.2 %, respectively. On this basis, a series of high-impact weather events critical to the operation of new-type power system are identified. The spatial distribution of their frequency hotspots and intensity extremes are further analyzed. The CNPS-Met dataset is expected to benefit research and applications at the intersection of meteorology and new-type power systems."

Marín;Kyle R. Clem;Benjamin Pohl;Victoire Buffet;Vincent Favier;Tomás Carrasco-Escaff;Bradford S. Barrett,A Multi-Method Antarctic Atmospheric Blocking Dataset (1979–2024),"Atmospheric blocking near Antarctica drives long lasting circulation anomalies and extreme events, yet it remains poorly understood. We created a new public dataset for 1979 to 2024 using global reanalysis data and several detection methods applied in a consistent way. We found strong method dependent differences in how often, where, and how long blocking occurs, showing that no single approach captures all forms of Antarctic blocking. 
 Atmospheric blocking is a key driver of persistent circulation anomalies and associated extreme events in the Southern Hemisphere, yet its characteristics around Antarctica remain poorly understood due to methodological diversity and the absence of a consolidated, long-term dataset. This study presents a new multi-method Antarctic atmospheric blocking dataset covering the period 1979–2024, derived from ERA5 reanalysis and constructed using multiple blocking detection approaches applied consistently across the Southern Hemisphere (25° S–90° S). The dataset integrates diagnostics based on 500 hPa geopotential height and vertically integrated potential vorticity within a unified framework for spatial filtering, event definition, and temporal tracking. It provides instantaneous blocking masks, spatiotemporally tracked event catalogues, time series, and aggregated climatologies that are directly comparable across methods. The results reveal only weak large-scale similarities in Antarctic blocking across detection approaches, mainly related to high latitude occurrence and seasonal modulation. In contrast, pronounced method dependent diversity is evident in blocking frequency, spatial extent, the number of detected blocking events, and persistence. Geopotential height-based methods identify a broader spectrum of anticyclonic flow regimes, including events extending into the Antarctic interior, whereas potential vorticity-based methods isolate fewer, more spatially confined events that emphasize dynamically coherent upper-level disturbances near the polar vortex. Event-based diagnostics further reveal systematic trade-offs between event frequency and duration, illustrating how different methodological choices preferentially capture either shorter-lived circulation anomalies or more persistent blocking structures. These contrasts arise from the diverse dynamical expressions of blocking at high southern latitudes, indicating that no single diagnostic fully captures Antarctic blocking behavior. Key uncertainties relate to threshold sensitivity, spatial filtering, and diagnostic formulation, which should be considered when interpreting blocking statistics and inter-method differences. By providing a consistent and openly accessible resource, this dataset allows direct intercomparison of blocking definitions, supports evaluation of climate models over Antarctica, and provides a foundation for future studies of blocking-related circulation variability and extreme events."

By linking 2 million profiles to nearby eddies, we built a large dataset that reveals how these features reshape ocean temperature and salinity structure, alter mixing, and transport heat and salt. The dataset supports better assessments of oceanic thermohaline environment variations, extreme events, and climate-related changes. 
 Mesoscale eddies are a fundamental component of ocean circulation and play a crucial role in shaping the three-dimensional distribution of ocean temperature and salinity. However, observational constraints have long limited systematic, global-scale quantification of eddy-induced thermohaline variability. Here, we present a global eddy-collocated historical temperature and salinity profile dataset spanning 29 years (1993–2021), constructed by integrating in situ hydrographic profile observations with satellite-derived mesoscale eddy tracking products. The dataset contains 2.35 million quality-controlled temperature-salinity profiles, each collocated with the nearest mesoscale eddy on the sampling day that may have influenced the observed water column. The profiles provide broad global coverage, with most 2°×2° grid boxes containing more than 150 observations, enabling statistically robust analyses from regional to global scales. Validation against well-documented regional eddy signatures shows that the dataset consistently reproduces well-established eddy-induced temperature and salinity anomaly structures across diverse ocean regions. Example applications demonstrate the dataset’s capability to investigate the spatial heterogeneity and vertical extent of eddy-induced thermohaline anomalies, eddy impacts on mixed-layer depth and stratification, eddy contributions to subsurface extreme temperature events, and eddy-driven heat and material transports. This dataset provides a comprehensive observational foundation for advancing quantitative assessments of mesoscale eddy impacts on regional to global ocean physical environment, heat budgets, and climate change."

Archibald,Development of fully interactive hydrogen with methane in UKESM1.0,"Hydrogen (H2) is an indirect greenhouse gas by increasing methane (CH4) lifetime. Interaction between H2 and CH4 is important for hydrogen’s global warming potential (GWP). Global models do not represent this interaction well; H2 or CH4 are prescribed at the surface. We implement an interactive H2 scheme into a global model coupled with interactive CH4. We simulate scenarios demonstrating its capability, improving model performance and more accurately representing H2-CH4 interaction. 
 Hydrogen is a potential candidate for an alternate energy source and carrier. As usage of hydrogen in industry rises, leakages into the atmosphere may occur, causing an increase in the global atmospheric hydrogen concentration. Hydrogen is an indirect greenhouse gas, known to increase methane, stratospheric water vapour, and tropospheric ozone. Methane and hydrogen are closely coupled, with the main atmospheric destructive pathway of both species being via reaction with the hydroxyl radical (OH). Currently, most earth system models (ESMs) simulate hydrogen or methane with a prescribed lower boundary condition, which suppresses chemical feedbacks at the surface. In this work, we implement hydrogen emissions and a hydrogen soil uptake scheme into an ESM with free-running methane to demonstrate the capability of a fully interactive hydrogen and methane emissions-driven ESM. We show that the model is able to capture long term trends and seasonal cycles of both species when compared to observations, and find that the inclusion of both fluxes does not impact other chemical species in the model, such as tropospheric ozone. We show that the model can be used under pre-industrial conditions and present day scenarios. The ESM with fully coupled hydrogen and methane chemistry has great potential to be used in future scenarios and to estimate a more accurate global warming potential of hydrogen."

Here, we assess five Improved Forest Management projects in China by constructing baselines using ex-post counterfactual methods based on satellite observations from 2001 to 2020. Applying methods including synthetic control, statistical matching, and machine learning, our counterfactuals, which accurately tracked pre-intervention carbon dynamics, reveal systematic underestimation of carbon sequestration in the reported baseline scenarios. We find that project forests would have continued to accumulate carbon stock naturally, contrary to the projects’ static and artificially low baseline projections. Using our empirically derived baselines, we find no evidence that management activities are additional across our study samples. These biased baselines contribute to systematic over-crediting: ex-ante projected emission reductions exceed our estimates by a factor of 3.7 (uncertainty range: 1.7–5.7), while ex-post issued carbon credits exceed our estimates by a factor of 1.7 (uncertainty range: 0.8–2.5). These findings expose a fundamental limitation of current offset protocols, which fail to account for real and dynamic forest trends, leading to inflated climate benefits. We provide a scientifically grounded framework for robust, independent monitoring and dynamic baseline setting, which is crucial for ensuring the credibility of nature-based solutions."

H. Prevot,Unappreciated Role of Photochemical Aging of Biogenic Organic Nitrates in Atmospheric Ozone Formation,"Biogenic organic nitrate compounds (BONs) are major components of atmospheric secondary organic aerosols (SOA) and significantly impact the production of O3 through photochemical aging. However, the photolysis mechanisms and roles of BONs, especially the highly oxygenated molecules (HOMs-BONs), in the formation of the O3 remain unclear. By combining lab chamber experiments, numerical model simulation, and field observation, here we show that under our experimental conditions, the O3 formation rate through α-pinene-ONs photolysis is ten times greater than that of isoprene-ONs. This enhancement arises from stronger intramolecular interactions between the carbonyl and nitrooxy functional groups in α-pinene-ONs, which promote ultraviolet absorption and accelerate photolytic decomposition. The photolysis pathways of those BONs are different. While isoprene-ONs undergo photolysis through an initial cleavage of the O–NO2 bond followed by RO fragmentation, α-pinene-ONs undergo multigeneration photolysis commencing with C(O)–C bond cleavage and subsequent O–NO2 bond dissociation. We found that these BONs are actually oxidized by OH radicals via H abstraction from the peroxyhydroxyl group (−OOH) rather than the traditional thought from aldehyde (C(O)–H) or hydroxyl groups (−OH). Currently, the contribution of BONs photolysis to O3 formation is significantly underestimated in models, mainly due to neglecting the photolysis role of HOMs-BONs. Our study is the first to reveal a non-negligible contribution of α-pinene-ONs to atmospheric ozone formation, which should be accounted for by photochemical models in the future."

Thirty-one PFAS congeners were analyzed, and PFAS exposure profiles differed across matrices. Significant positive dose–response relationships were observed for long-chain perfluorosulfonic acids (PFSAs) between hair and serum.

In this study, we investigated the potential toxicity of 13 prevalent PHCZs utilizing a network toxicology approach, which revealed shared molecular targets associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Molecular docking simulations assessed the binding affinities of these PHCZs for eight key PD-related targets, identifying monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) as a critical target. Among the dihalogenated PHCZs, 2,7-dibromocarbazole (2,7-BCZ) exhibited the highest binding affinity to MAOB. Comparative molecular docking and dynamics simulations suggest that the inhibition of MAOB activity by 2,7-BCZ is a potential initiating event in PHCZ-induced neurological disorders. In vivo experiments confirmed that 2,7-BCZ exposure highly correlates with α-synuclein aggregation, a hallmark of PD pathology. Transcriptomic sequencing of 2,7-BCZ-exposed SH-SY5Y cells, combined with analysis of public PD microarray data, identified shared transcriptional alterations in genes including CLSTN2, CBLN1, AGTR1, DLK1, and DDC. By integrating pathways from PD-related targets of PHCZs, differentially expressed genes in 2,7-BCZ-exposed cells, and public PD data sets, we further elucidated key biological pathways through which 2,7-BCZ may contribute to PD pathogenesis, particularly dopaminergic synapse function and neurodevelopmental regulation. Collectively, this study not only highlights the potential role of PHCZs in PD, elucidating the potential biological mechanisms by which PHCZs may exacerbate PD, but also exemplifies an innovative, animal-sparing approach using New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) to assess environmental pollutants’ risks in neurodegenerative adverse outcomes."

We first evaluated the effect of carbon and polymer fractions on ionic and electronic transport within the cation-shuttling electrodes, demonstrating that optimal performance requires balancing ion mobility through the polymer phase and the electronic conductivity and ion storage capacity provided by the carbon phase. We then assessed the impact of electrode capacity and conductivity on EIP performance by varying the ratio of activated carbon and carbon black, showing that desalination performance is relatively stable over a wide range of capacity and is only undermined at extremely low capacity. Finally, we analyze the role of cycle time and show that EIP has similar specific energy consumption with very different cycle times as long as electrolysis is prevented. Overall, these results establish guiding principles for rational electrode design and operation to achieve optimal EIP performance."

Here, we overturn this paradigm by reporting a widespread yet overlooked nanoscale phenomenon. Using a newly established suite of in situ atomic force microscope (AFM) techniques, we first visualized the dynamic formation of PFAS nanoclusters at the interface of naturally extracted dissolved organic matter (DOM). We further deciphered the underlying mechanism by probing intermolecular interactions, demonstrating that strong binding forces between PFAS molecules and specific DOM functional groups yield numerous small nanoclusters, whereas weaker interactions result in larger, sparser nanoclusters. This mechanism is quantified by a strong negative correlation (R = −0.983, P = 0.017) between nanocluster size and abundance across diverse PFAS structures (nonionic, anionic, cationic, zwitterionic). Crucially, plant exposure experiments demonstrate that this nanocluster formation universally mitigates PFAS phytotoxicity in rice seedlings. Compared to its molecularly dispersed state, the nanoclustered PFAS exhibit significantly reduced uptake, sequestered on root surfaces as a physical barrier. This work identifies the DOM-induced nanoclustering as a critical interface process that governs the bioaccessibility and risks of PFAS, thereby offering a transformative perspective for their environmental assessment and remediation."

This study investigates DA production and trophic transfer in the Pearl River Estuary, combining chemotaxonomy, morphological identification, ITS1 metabarcoding, and HPLC–MS/MS analysis. We revealed strong seasonal and spatial heterogeneity in Pseudonitzschia assemblages, identifying Pseudonitzschia cuspidata Clade III as a dominant DA producer with an estimated in situ cellular quota of 0.1–0.8 pg cell–1 for the community. DA was ubiquitously detected across trophic levels, with summer maxima in phytoplankton to zooplankton, crustaceans, and mollusks, exceeding safety thresholds with 24.1 mg kg–1 in scallops. Baseline DA contamination persisted year-round, with this chronic risk amplified by increased summer diatom biomass. Crucially, DA production was governed by optimal salinity and temperature and linked to nutrient stoichiometry rather than absolute nutrient concentration; chronic high nutrient levels showed a negative correlation with DA production. These environmental drivers also influenced DA transfer efficiency, with summer conditions amplifying contamination despite sub-bloom cell densities. These findings reveal underestimated risks in subtropical estuaries, providing a critical framework for monitoring and managing DA contamination under climate variability."

However, differential toxicity remains to be established to improve monitoring and mitigation efforts. This study examines the oxidative potential (OP) of fine particulate matter using the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay as a proxy for toxicity. We analyzed 42 ambient particle filter samples from Frankfurt, Germany, and Beijing, China, focusing on water-soluble organic compounds. The aqueous extracts were analyzed for metal content via inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry and for organic compounds through ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry. Utilizing a chelating agent to remove metals allowed separation of the effects of bulk aerosol and organics only. A hierarchical cluster analysis identified key compounds linked to OP, including yet unknown quinones, C9H6O6 (an oxidation product of o-xylene), and C9H8O4 (an oxidation product of trimethylbenzene), suggesting secondary products from aromatic precursors. We also found phthalic acid, a tracer for biomass burning and vehicular exhaust, and nitrosalicylic acid, an OP-enhancing compound. A volume-normalized OP of up to 4 nmol DTT min–1 m–3 was observed after metal removal, underscoring the importance of stable organic compounds and isolating metals to understand their relationship with OP in ambient particulate matter."

Here, we identify the hidden key membrane properties governing perchlorate rejection by using four commercial NF membranes in natural and synthetic waters. Perchlorate rejection was generally low, as it is intrinsically disadvantaged in inevitable co-ion competition with dominant anions, particularly sulfate and chloride, owing to its low hydration energy and typically much lower concentration. Mitigating such co-ion competition is therefore central to enhancing perchlorate rejection. Reducing membrane negative charge density partially alleviated co-ion competition, as evidenced by an increase in perchlorate rejection from ∼20% to ∼48% for the small-pore DK membrane when natural water pH decreased from 8.8 to 6.4. Beyond pore and charge effects, however, ion–membrane interactions were found to be comparably decisive. Specifically, the highly rigid and weakly hydrophilic active layer of the DK membrane impeded perchlorate adsorption, suppressing competitive permeation of monovalent anions and thereby enhancing perchlorate rejection. These findings indicate that attenuating ion–membrane interactions through enhancing structural rigidity offers a viable strategy for achieving higher removal of perchlorate and other weakly hydrated anions, providing new mechanistic insights for NF membrane design."

Herein, we developed a colorimetric sensor array based on gold nanoparticles (nano-Au) that utilizes UV–vis spectral shifts induced by interactions with phosphorus species. Four molecular modifiers, i.e., cysteamine (CS), neodymium (Nd), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), and tributylhexadecylphosphonium bromide (THPB), were strategically incorporated into the nano-Au receptors to generate distinct response patterns via coordination, hydrophobic interactions, and electrostatic attractions. These optical “fingerprints” were deciphered using pattern recognition techniques. The sensor array successfully differentiated 11 phosphorus species (including organophosphonic acids, organophosphate esters, and inorganic phosphates, with 100% classification accuracy for the 11 target species within the tested training set) at concentrations ranging from 1.0 to 50 mg/L, both individually and in mixtures; it exhibits high sensitivity, with detection limits ranging from 0.17 to 0.94 mg/L for the 11 phosphorus species. The sensor array demonstrated robust anti-interference capability, achieving recoveries between 90%–96% in both simulated and real water matrices. Notably, the sensor enabled in situ determination of residual phosphorus concentrations in actual phosphorus adsorption treatments, and the yielded results are highly consistent with standard spectroscopic measurements, highlighting its practical potential for simplifying environmental monitoring and water quality analysis."

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are critical industrial chemicals with superior functionalities but proven hazards. Trade-offs between functionalities and hazards constitute the challenge in PFAS green substitution, known as multiparameter optimization. The essential goal of multiparameter optimization is discerning chemicals for which enhancements in one property invariably lead to degradations of others. In statistical parlance, the chemicals constitute the Pareto optimal frontiers (POFs). Based on generative machine learning algorithms, this study developed a method named ParetoGen for propelling POFs of multiobjective optimization issues in green alternative designs. Results demonstrate the ParetoGen stably and significantly pushed the POFs of functionality-hazard trade-offs in the design of green alternatives to PFASs. Compared with existing PFAS alternatives, structures generated by the ParetoGen exhibit lower hazards and enhanced functionalities. By introducing the Pareto optimization theory into the molecular design of green alternatives, this study establishes a universal theoretical foundation and evaluation methodology for green chemical substitution. The findings reveal valuable insights into the chemical structural design of PFASs, and the developed method can be employed in general chemical structural design tasks."

Products formed under varying NOx levels were then classified using volatility and reactivity in aerosols and applied to the UNIfied Partitioning Aerosol Phase Reaction (UNIPAR) model, which predicts secondary organic aerosol (SOA) mass via multiphase reactions of hydrocarbons. UNIPAR was demonstrated using chamber data generated under varying environments. Daytime SOA formed dominantly by oxidations with OH radicals, and its order in SOA yields is as follows: 3-methylcatechol > o-cresol > o-catechol ≈ phenol. The NOx dependency of daytime SOA was weak and varied for each hydrocarbon. The methyl group on o-cresol and 3-methylcatechol increases SOA yields compared to phenol and o-catechol, respectively. With 50 ppb hydrocarbon under varying NOx levels, daytime o-cresol SOA yields are 0.46–0.68, which are 2-times larger than phenol, and those of 3-methylcatechol reach to 0.86, which is nearly 3-times higher than o-catechol. Nighttime oxidation of o-catechol (0.31) and 3-methylcatechol with O3 or NO3 produces considerable SOA yields 0.67 for 3-methylcatechol and 0.31 for o-catechol.

Our previous study was the first to discover that PM2.5 induces a decrease in microtubule dynamics and promotes the formation of multinucleated cells in the human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B). To elucidate the intrinsic mechanism by which PM2.5 causes multinucleation in bronchial epithelial cells, we conducted in vivo experiments using C57BL/6J mice exposed to PM2.5 via intratracheal instillation, as well as in vitro mechanistic studies using BEAS-2B cells. To verify the involvement of the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signaling pathway, we employed PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and GSK-3β-overexpressing BEAS-2B cells. In both in vivo and in vitro experiments, an increase in multinucleated cells was observed following PM2.5 treatment. Additionally, PM2.5 directly led to a higher proportion of polymerized microtubules and abnormal microtubule aggregation. In the mechanistic studies, we mainly investigated the impact of PM2.5 on the microtubule dynamics. The results demonstrated that PM2.5 activated the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signaling pathway, which inhibited the deacetylase enzyme HDAC6, resulting in excessive microtubule acetylation. Simultaneously, PM2.5 induced the dissociation of microtubule-associated protein MAP1B from the microtubules. Both processes contributed to the overstabilization of microtubule proteins. However, mitosis requires highly dynamic microtubules, characterized by rapid switching between growth and shrinkage. Therefore, the overstabilization of microtubule proteins induced by PM2.5 reduced the microtubule dynamics and disrupted spindle function during mitosis, ultimately leading to mitotic failure and the formation of multinucleated cells."

Gray;Molly Trudgill;Madison Shankle;Sarah Eggleston;Casimir de Lavergne;Eric D. Galbraith,Disequilibrium and Soft Tissue Pump Contributions to Glacial CO2 Drawdown,"A more “efficient” biological pump is thought to have played a key role in glacial CO2 drawdown, with two principal mechanisms invoked to stem the CO2 “leak” from the modern Southern Ocean. The first sees a strengthened soft tissue pump, associated with a reduction in the ocean's “preformed” nutrient inventory. The second sees an increase in air‐sea CO2 disequilibrium (termed the disequilibrium pump). We use an Earth system model (CM2Mc) to show the tracers radiocarbon (Δ14C) and oxygen (O2) exhibit distinct sensitivities to these two pumps within the deep ocean: Δ14C is more sensitive to disequilibrium pump changes, whereas O2 is more sensitive to soft tissue pump changes, as expected from the underlying processes. We apply these pump‐specific tracer stoichiometries to available deep ocean Δ14C and O2 proxy data from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Despite the sparsity of O2 data, the results show a consistent increase in soft tissue and disequilibrium DIC within the deep ocean of ∼135 μmol/kg, with broadly comparable contributions from the two pumps. Our results imply a reduction in air‐sea gas exchange (likely linked to expansion and/or increased isolation of Antarctic Bottom Water), as well as a slowdown of deep ocean overturning and Southern Ocean upwelling at the LGM. Notably, current ocean models struggle to simulate both of these changes simultaneously under glacial forcings. The combined changes in the soft tissue and disequilibrium DIC are of sufficient magnitude to explain the glacial reduction in atmospheric CO2 once a whole ocean alkalinity increase is accounted for."

However, it has been proposed that the higher stratospheric Δ17O(O3) can't be preserved en‐route to the troposphere given the rapidly re‐established isotopic equilibrium by photochemistry. Here, we reported Δ17O(O3) data mainly from the Tibetan Plateau, and found the relatively high Δ17O(O3) at Mt. Everest can't be explained by in situ photochemistry. Instead, the distinct diurnal cycle with elevated nighttime value at Mt. Everest is associated with the katabatic wind bringing stratosphere‐sourced O3 with high Δ17O. This demonstrates that the high Δ17O(O3) can be preserved at troposphere at some circumstances. Given the fast transfer of Δ17O(O3) to atmospheric nitrate, it might be potential to probe past STT of O3 using nearby ice core records of nitrate."

We estimate trends in effective radiative forcing (ERF) by separating TOA flux changes into forcing and response components, using feedback parameters derived from observed and simulated interannual variability and the CO2‐forced response. From 2010 to 2024, ERF trends are ∼1.0 W m−2 per decade for both net and shortwave fluxes, exceeding those for 2001–2024 and substantially larger than projections from state‐of‐the‐art models. This discrepancy persists across a wide range of climate sensitivities and forcing scenarios and shows limited sensitivity to feedback assumptions. The largest contribution arises from the shortwave component, with spatial patterns indicating particularly strong forcing increases over northern midlatitude oceans. These results suggest that the gap between observations and models is widening, although the contribution of internal variability cannot be entirely excluded."

However, under the severe oceanic and atmospheric conditions of these storms, even spaceborne microwave radiometers struggle to retrieve reliable humidity data. This limitation stems primarily from heavy precipitation, which masks the water‐vapor signal in the observed brightness temperatures. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces a two‐pronged approach: (a) a neural network‐based screening of brightness temperatures to filter out precipitation‐contaminated measurements, and (b) the first use of low‐frequency microwave channel for humidity estimation in tropical cyclones. Comparisons with independent in situ observations demonstrate that our method provides more accurate near‐surface humidity estimates than previous techniques that do not use low‐frequency channels. These improvements will enhance the estimation of ocean‐to‐atmosphere enthalpy fluxes during tropical cyclones and may support better understanding of air‐sea interaction processes under extreme weather conditions."

Smith,Climate Implications of Hydrogen Deployment Considering Changes in Emissions From Direct and Indirect Forcers,"Hydrogen could help to decarbonize hard‐to‐electrify end uses in future energy systems. While increased hydrogen production, transmission, distribution, and use may lead to an increase in hydrogen emissions, both greenhouse gas (GHG) and non‐GHG emissions could decline as hydrogen displaces incumbent fuels and energy carriers. The full suite of potential climate forcing changes from hydrogen deployment has not been fully examined, in part because it requires combining information from different fields. This study addresses this gap by using a well‐known integrated assessment model (the Global Change Analysis Model) to combine (1) credible hydrogen deployment scenarios that illustrate which fuels and energy carriers could be displaced by hydrogen; (2) information about emissions of hydrogen and other forcers by technology, sector, region, and time; and (3) a simple climate model capable of translating relevant emissions into changes in radiative forcing. Across all scenarios considered, when compared to a scenario without expanded hydrogen deployment, reduced forcing from lower CO2 emissions is larger than other forcing changes by 2050 even after accounting for hydrogen and other indirect forcers. Forcing attributable to methane emissions may increase or decrease depending on how much hydrogen is produced with natural gas and how much natural gas is displaced as a fuel. Lastly, the net forcing change from changes in emissions of the indirect forcers CO, NOx, NMVOC, and H2, including their impact on methane's lifetime, is always small and in most cases negative at midcentury. These findings raise important questions for technology assessment regarding the treatment of indirect forcers and aerosols."

 Nitrogen, serving as both a vital nutrient and a potent pollutant, has an important role in the pursuit of global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, the comprehensive impact of nitrogen on SDG achievement remains relatively unclear. Here we utilize the Coupled Human and Natural Systems (CHANS) model to build a framework for assessing the influence of nitrogen on SDGs in China during 2020. Our analysis reveals that nitrogen use and loss in China affect 11 out of the 17 SDGs, with notable regional disparities. In general, regions with higher economic development perform better in the nitrogen-related SDG (SDG-N) scores within the economy dimension, but score lower in the society and environment dimensions. Our simulations indicate that comprehensive nitrogen management is crucial to foster synergy among SDGs, which could enhance SDG-N index scores in China by 8–26%, resulting in substantial national benefits, including US$162 billion (US$98–208 billion) in savings on fertilizer and food imports, increased agricultural yields, improved public health, enhanced ecosystem resilience and climate mitigation. Importantly, these benefits can be achieved with a modest net implementation cost of only US$34 billion (US$27–41 billion), making it a cost-effective and sustainable solution for advancing China’s SDG agenda.

Here we show that their dissolved inorganic carbon is some 2,170–3,515 14C years old and partially (39–40%) originates from the surrounding peatlands. This implies a loss pathway for peat carbon, in which microbes respire old carbon within the peat and the resulting CO2 is transported to the lakes and outgassed, linking these immense ancient stores to the modern carbon cycle. Two major humic lakes in the Congo Basin emit ancient carbon from nearby peatlands into the atmosphere, as shown by the isotopic signatures of their carbon pools."

Disruption of this pathway impairs male fertility, and pathogenic ASB9 variants are found in infertile men. 
 The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) represents an evolutionarily conserved machinery governing proteostasis through spatiotemporal regulation of protein degradation. While spermatogenesis involves multilayered regulatory mechanisms spanning translation to dynamic post-translational modifications (PTMs), the identity of UPS-associated E3 ligases orchestrating germ cell-specific protein turnover remains elusive. Here, we identify a testis-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase complex comprising elongin B/C, Cullin-2 (CUL2), RING-box protein-1 (RBX1), and SOCS box protein ASB9, designated ECSASB9. Genetic ablation of ECSASB9 in mice via ubiquitous Asb9 knockout (KO) or spermatid-specific elongin B/C conditional KO disrupts spermiogenesis and compromises fertility. Mechanistic studies reveal that ECSASB9 engages tubulin beta 4 A (TUBB4A) through substrate recognition, catalyzing K48-linked polyubiquitination at lysine 379 (K379) to promote proteasomal degradation. Notably, Tubb4aK379R knock-in (KI) mice phenocopy the spermiogenesis defects observed upon ECSASB9 deficiency. Clinically, we identify three hemizygous missense variants in X-linked ASB9 among Chinese males with idiopathic infertility. Male mice bearing orthologous ASB9 variant exhibit oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT) and subfertility, mirroring human phenotypes. Taken together, our findings establish ECSASB9 as an important regulator of spermatogenic proteostasis and provide mechanistic insights into UPS-mediated tissue-specific degradation, while implicating ASB9 variants in male infertility pathogenesis. A testis-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, ECSASB9, governs spermiogenesis by promoting TUBB4A degradation. Disruption of this pathway impairs male fertility, and pathogenic ASB9 variants are found in infertile men."

Here, the authors use data on locations frequented by people who inject drugs in New Delhi, India to model different service prioritisation strategies. 
 People who inject drugs (PWID) in India continue to experience high HIV incidence while coverage of HIV and harm reduction services within this population remains suboptimal in many settings, highlighting the need to identify novel service delivery points. To evaluate the effectiveness of spatially focused upscaling of interventions at observed venues where PWID injected drugs together, we developed an individual-based dynamic transmission model of HIV informed by detailed injection network, service engagement, and injection venue attendance data collected in a sociometric study of PWID (n = 2512) in New Delhi, India. HIV incidence was simulated for different spatial targeting strategies and with increasing service coverage at injection venues according to UNAIDS/UNODC goals. We identified significant decreases in predicted HIV incidence when deploying interventions at frequently visited injection venues (from 6.8 cases/100 person-years to 2.7/100PY for full service coverage at the most-visited venue, and further down to 1.3/100PY for 12 most-visited venues). Prioritizing the most visited venues stratified by spatial clusters provided services to a larger number of individuals versus prioritizing the overall most visited venues, suggesting that service expansion at venues that are spatially distinct with minimal population overlap has a slightly larger impact on reducing HIV incidence. Spatial targeting of HIV services may improve their effectiveness. Here, the authors use data on locations frequented by people who inject drugs in New Delhi, India to model different service prioritisation strategies."

Here, the authors characterize a cross-sectional delineation of microbiota changes across normal, polyp, and colorectal cancer tissues. 
 Emerging evidence suggests that tissue-resident microbiota (TRM) is associated with tumor biology; however, their distribution and compositional characteristics across different colorectal tissue types remain incompletely defined. Here, we conducted a comprehensive cross-sectional analysis of TRM distribution and abundance across 1134 clinical specimens, including normal mucosa, precancerous polyps, and colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues. Our results reveal distinct microbial profiles among these diagnostic groups, with consistent differences in community composition between normal, polyps, and CRC samples. Integrative analyses further identified microbial signatures capable of distinguishing tissue categories and reflected differences in the local tumor microenvironment. In contrast, intratumoral microbiota composition showed subtle variation across established tumor stages and was not associated with clinical outcomes. These findings define diagnostic group-associated patterns of TRM in colorectal tissues and establish a foundation for future mechanistic investigations into the biological roles of TRM in colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer has been associated with changes in tissue-resident microbiota.

 Altermagnetic multiferroics, hosting coexisting spin-splitting bands and ferroelectric polarization, offer a promising route to magnetoelectric coupling beyond conventional relativistic spin–orbit mechanism. However, the lack of a unified principle connecting ferroelectric switching symmetry to spin-band topology has impeded rational material design. Here, we establish a universal symmetry-based framework that classifies all possible spin–ferroelectric couplings in altermagnets into three fundamental types: decoupling, pseudo-time-reversal coupling, and asymmetric momentum mapping. This classification stems directly from the relation between ferroelectric switching operators and the spin Laue group, creating a decisive symmetry-to-function paradigm. First-principles calculations on bilayer MnPS3 confirm the framework, showing that distinct ferroelectric switching paths produce characteristic spin-band reconstructions and discriminable electrical transport signatures. The universality of the framework is further validated in BiFeO3. Our work provides a predictive design principle for voltage-programmable spintronics, effectively transforming ferroelectric symmetry from a structural descriptor into a dynamic functional control knob for altermagnetic spin states. The authors establish a universal symmetry framework that classifies spin–ferroelectric couplings in altermagnetic multiferroics into three fundamental types: decoupling, pseudo-time-reversal coupling, and asymmetric momentum mapping."

 Waste-to-energy incineration addresses the dual pressures of municipal solid waste growth and energy shortages. Persistently low energy efficiency has limited its role as energy sources. We compile a national database of 975 plants including 2151 incinerators across China, showing that they supplied up to 7% of residential electricity consumption in 2023. A three-tier classification framework was established based on energy efficiency performance to distinguish disposal-oriented, energy-recovery, and green energy plants. Scenario projections under five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways indicated that waste incineration could generate up to 259 TWh by 2035, meeting 13% of residential demand. Artificial intelligence-based control and waste heat recovery are the most cost-effective. Efficiency improvements could mitigate up to 60% of greenhouse gas and flue-gas pollutant emissions relative to the 2035 baseline. These findings could redefine the role of waste incineration in low-carbon energy systems and provide scalable insights for emerging economies undergoing waste and energy transitions.

 The demand for bio-inspired neuromorphic systems drives research on artificial neuronal devices with dual excitatory/inhibitory capabilities. Although perovskite memristors show promise, interfacial barriers and rapid ion migration hinder modulation. This study addresses these challenges through atomic-scale cathode engineering, developing perovskite-based memristor (Au/Ni1-rGO/MAPbI3/ITO) with nickel single-atom modified reduced graphene oxide (Ni1-rGO) cathode. The Ni–O configuration of Ni1-rGO with a single Ni atom anchored on rGO, modulates the electronic properties of rGO, reducing Schottky barrier via energy band alignment for bipolar current symmetry and spatially confining iodide ion migration through a high diffusion energy barrier (2.912 eV), conferring 780 ms relaxation. The device achieves 1,000 distinct conductance states and emulates interlayer connections and bidirectional signal transmission in feedback neuronal networks. We demonstrate neuromorphic functionalities: unsupervised competitive learning exceeds 50% clustering accuracy, while cooperative learning solves NP-hard problem 6× faster than simulated annealing, establishing an atomic-engineered approach for high-efficiency neuromorphic hardware.
