We report a pioneering elucidation of a distinct Co(II)/Co(III) cycling mechanism within electrochemically enhanced PMS-AOPs, utilizing Co(II) as a model catalyst. Remarkably, this cycling process predominantly unfolds in the anodic region, rather than the cathodic, revealing a novel aspect of electrochemical modulation. Co(III), generated by anodic oxidation, emerges as a pivotal species that disrupts the dimerized hydrolysis product ([Co(III)OH]24+). Electron transfer from the hydroxyl oxygen in [Co(III)OH]24+ to Co(III) induces electron redistribution, ultimately facilitating Co(III) reduction and release via both outer- and inner-sphere electron transfer pathways. Gibbs free energy calculations unequivocally confirm the spontaneity of the cyclic process. Our system exhibits superior performance metrics, achieving Co(IV)═O (5.57 × 10–2 mM/M Co) and SO4•– (2.51 × 10–6 mM/M OSO3) yields that surpass most reported catalytic systems, along with an exceptional mass activity of Co(II) (368.87 L/g). This study offers a fresh perspective on Mn+ regeneration for sustained PMS activation in homogeneous transition metal catalysis, with potential implications for advancing the field of environmental remediation."

Previous studies suggested that metallic iron can be present in the mantle and subducted slabs at depth through disproportionation and serpentinization of silicates. Here we show that hydrous phases in the subducted slabs such as superhydrous phase B, phase E, and phase Egg react with metallic iron to produce less hydrous or anhydrous silicates, oxides, and H2 in the deep mantle. The produced H2 can ascend and react with Fe3+‐bearing silicates in the overlying mantle, leading to the formation of hydrous phases and melts. The high mobility of H2 fluid compared with hydrous species will expedite the deep hydrogen cycle. Meanwhile, the oxidation states of subducted slab and various mantle layers will undergo gradual homogenization as a result of coupled redox dehydrogenation and hydration processes."

In this study, we applied shear‐wave splitting analysis of core‐refracted phases recorded by a newly deployed dense seismic array and six permanent stations to delineate crustal and mantle deformation processes. The observed fast polarization directions are predominantly aligned NNW–SSE, while the splitting delay times vary across four sub‐blocks. The anisotropy pattern suggests a dominantly asthenospheric origin, consistent with southeastward‐directed mantle flow associated with the extrusion of the Tibetan lithosphere. The splitting delay times are relatively larger near major faults and tectonic boundaries compared to areas farther away, and the fast polarization directions beneath these structures exhibit a moderate rotation toward the fault strike, indicating that such tectonic discontinuities contribute to observable azimuthal anisotropy."

However, post‐spreading volcanism has obscured the original fabric along or near the extinct spreading ridge (ESR). We present a detailed VP/VS model along a profile perpendicular to the ESR, constructed using independent tomography of P‐ and S‐wave data. This model provides critical constraints on the crustal lithology and tectonic evolution of the ESR. Our results show significant thinning of the crust (∼3.3–4.3 km) near the ESR. Within the thin crustal regions, anomalously elevated VP/VS ratios (>1.9) may indicate tectonic uplift of serpentinites. These observations indicate a substantial reduction in magma supply during the terminal phases of spreading, resulting in a near absence of lower crust. During this period, tectonic extension dominated, and crustal fracturing facilitated seawater infiltration into the upper mantle, promoting serpentinite formation."

This is called a shock‐substorm here to differentiate it from generic substorms. The shock, with a speed of ∼790 km s−1, caused the release of prestored magnetosphere/magnetotail energy plus additional solar wind input energy, the latter unusual for a shock‐nonsupersubstorm event. The internal magnetospheric shock/wave had a speed of ∼630 km s−1, consistent with arriving at x = −6 RE at the time of substorm onset. The internal shock arrival to x = −10 RE would have been after the substorm onset time, so magnetic reconnection for the substorm triggering can be ruled out.

Using 8‐year (2016–2023) high‐resolution soundings from China radiosonde network, we establish observational pre‐SCW thresholds, revealing divergent pre‐storm pathways that advance beyond conventional SCW paradigms: Wet SCW events exhibit abrupt energy cycling (≤20‐min Convective Available Potential Energy collapse coinciding with about 15% moisture surges) coupled with mid‐level cyclonic rotation breakdown, while dry SCW events show a distinct two‐stage kinetic energy descent, featuring initial downward wind kinetic energy transfer from 5 to 2 km altitude within −40 to −20 min, followed by rapid surface downdraft acceleration. Physically, wet events derive intensity from deep instability amplified by moisture enhancement, driving robust convection. Dry events originate from shallow instability released through pulsed downdrafts with weaker gusts. Machine learning attribution (SHAP >0.24) establishes precipitable water as the dominant discriminator (wet: >48 mm; dry: <40 mm).

With focus on non‐local effects of Tibetan Plateau soil moisture (TPSM), this study explores the close linkage between anomalies of TPSM in boreal spring and air temperature of NEA (NEAT) in early summer based on observational diagnosis, and the influence mechanism is verified by numerical model experiments. The drier mid‐west TPSM in April could persist into early summer and reduce the TP evaporation, which leads to positive anomalies of surface sensible heat flux heating the TP atmosphere. Heated air further exciting the wave train, and NEA is covered by positive geopotential height anomalies. Higher pressure results the downdraft and thus abnormally high air temperatures in NEA eventually. This study suggests that TPSM in spring may act as a new precursor providing an additional source of predictability for early‐summer NEAT."

Using abrupt 4xCO2 experiments, we show that the global‐mean WV feedback is nearly a linear function of the temperature feedback, the slope of which is explained by the longwave radiative efficiency of WV (ϵ) $({\epsilon})$. Although ϵ ${\epsilon}$ remains constant across models in the global mean, it exhibits substantial spatial variations and is particularly weak in Antarctica, where near‐surface inversions decouple the surface from the free troposphere. We introduce a surface–free troposphere temperature difference (SFTD) metric, showing that positive SFTD (e.g., high lifting condensation level) amplifies ϵ ${\epsilon}$, while negative SFTD (e.g., strong surface inversion) suppresses it. These findings provide a clear explanation of how local climate conditions modulate the radiative compensation between temperature and WV feedbacks."

(2024, https://doi.org/10.1029/2024JD041720). Building on that study, this paper presents the time‐resolved leader spectra of two additional downward TGFs detected by the TASDs. The first TGF, triggered once, occurred during the Initial Breakdown Pulses (IBPs) of a negative return stroke with a low peak current (− ${-}$18.5 kA). The second TGF, triggered twice, was detected during the initial leader stage of a high‐peak‐current (− ${-}$133.4 kA) return stroke. The electric field change (E‐change) waveform caused by the leader preceding this return stroke had a brief duration (1.2 ms) and lacked strong IBPs. These unusual characteristics suggest that this lightning flash may represent a distinct type of event associated with TGF detection not previously observed at the TASD. Most importantly, the optical emissions of both TGF events align with previous findings and show ion emission lines before and after TGF detections while only neutral emission lines were recorded at the moment of TGF detections."

This study evaluates wintertime atmospheric profiles of temperature and specific humidity (SH) from three systems over New Delhi, India: radiosondes, a ground‐based microwave radiometer (MWR), and the INSAT‐3DR satellite sounder. Radiosondes serve as the reference standard, offering high vertical resolution but limited temporal coverage. The MWR provides continuous high‐temporal‐resolution observations with good performance in the lower troposphere, while INSAT‐3DR delivers broad spatial coverage and hourly retrievals but with coarser vertical resolution near the surface and reduced accuracy under cloudy conditions. The comparison reveals that MWR profiles agree well with radiosonde observations below 4 km, with root mean square error values of <4 K for temperature and <2.2 g/kg for SH. However, MWR retrievals exhibit near‐surface cold and dry biases of up to −5 K and −1.2 g/kg (∼−25%), respectively. INSAT‐3DR shows good agreement for temperature throughout the levels (bias of <2%). In the 4–10 km altitude range, SH biases are within ∼25%, but show warm and moist biases near the surface exceeding 2 K and 1 g/kg (30%). These results confirm the complementary nature of MWR and INSAT‐3DR: MWR performs best in the boundary layer, while INSAT‐3DR is more reliable in the mid to top troposphere.

However, the mechanisms governing DCLC behavior in these regions remain poorly understood due to sparse high‐precision observations and intricate meteorological conditions. In this study, we analyze 6 years (2014–2019) of ground‐based Ka‐band Zenith Radar (KAZR) observations from the Semi‐Arid Climate and Environment Observatory of Lanzhou University (SACOL) to investigate DCLC variability. Using Fourier decomposition, we propose a Bimodal Prominence Index (BPI) to quantify DCLC features and examine their seasonal transitions linked with key meteorological factors. Our results show that low clouds exhibit prominent bimodal structure with greater coverage and amplitude in cold seasons, transitioning toward unimodal pattern during warm months. Key meteorological factors, including estimated inversion strength (EIS), mid‐to‐lower tropospheric wind shear (MLWS), 700 hPa relative humidity (RH700) and 700 hPa vertical velocity (ω700), exhibit strong relationships with the DCLC variability. A multiple regression model incorporating these variables effectively reproduces the DCLC, achieving a high correlation coefficient of 0.71 with observations. RH700 and EIS primarily control low cloud formation while ω700 and MLWS modulate seasonal patterns. We found noon‐peaked RH700 and ω700 drive unimodal cloud in summer while strong inversions and enhanced nocturnal MLWS support bimodal clouds in winter. Autumn pattern reflect enhanced nighttime humidity and weakened daytime EIS peak favoring bimodality. These findings provide an insight into the meteorological controls of DCLC in semi‐arid environments and their role in affecting regional weather and climate."

We find that increased spring soil moisture in the CP corresponds to later NAM onset dates throughout much of the southwestern United States (US) and northwestern Mexico. Anomalously moist spring soils in the CP increase the seasonal‐average surface latent heat flux and decrease sensible heat flux, resulting in lower late spring and early summer surface temperatures and a weakened thermal gradient between the land and ocean. Decreased spring sensible heat flux also corresponds to decreased early summer geopotential heights over the southwestern US, a weaker NAM circulation, and reduced moisture flux into the NAM region. NAM onset dates in years with the highest spring soil moisture or snow depth content in the CP are delayed 1 week on average in the NAM region. Conversely, NAM onset dates in years with the lowest spring soil moisture or snow depth content in the CP occur 1 week earlier on average. While increased spring snow in the CP is correlated with a delayed NAM onset, the relationship between spring albedo and NAM onset lacks statistical significance, suggesting that CP snow anomalies affect the NAM by contributing soil moisture via snowmelt, rather than directly affecting the surface energy budget.

 Cropland non-agriculturalization (CNA) monitoring is a typical change detection (CD) problem based on remote sensing imagery, aimed at tracking cropland outflow changes, which holds significant importance for cropland protection and food security. Recently, numerous advanced CD methods have been proposed to address the CNA problem. However, applying these methods to cross-regional or large-scale CNA detection presents several challenges: (1) Radiance-feature differences of croplands across regions i.e., crop type and phenology differences arising from variations in planting structures and seasonality; (2) Change-pattern differences of croplands across regions, i.e., differences in predominant change types resulting from distinct regional economic development characteristics. These cross-regional differences, when coupled together, result in insufficient adaptability of CD methods across regions. To address these issues, a Cross-Region Cropland Change Detection (CR-CLCD) framework with Multi-View Domain Adaptation (MVDA) is proposed. Specifically, Pattern Distribution Contrastive (PDC) sub-module achieves feature alignment from the semantic view by imposing contrastive constraints across inter-domain categories. Radiative Discrepancy Adversarial (RDA) sub-module, performs inter-domain global and local feature confusion by identifying regions of local uncertainty and applying enhanced adversarial training. MVDA is a flexible, plug-and-play domain adaptation module that can be seamlessly integrated with any existing change detection backbone network (e.g., CNN, Transformer), enabling rapid generalization to new data under unsupervised conditions. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CR-CLCD method achieves the best or second-best accuracy compared to other domain adaptation methods across different baselines."

 Ground-measured fractional vegetation cover (FVC) data are critical for validating satellite-derived FVC products. However, spatial scale mismatches between ground plots and satellite pixels, compounded by the scarcity of field data in remote regions, introduce significant uncertainties in product validation. This study proposes a novel multi-tiered representativeness framework integrating three key indices: the absolute difference of spatial upscaling transformations, the heterogeneity of the surrounding environment, and FVC temporal stability. The framework’s implementation leveraged an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) observation network (870 monitoring plots, 2015–2024) within the alpine grassland ecosystem of the Three-River Source Region on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, classified into four levels, with levels 1–2 indicating high level and 3–4 lower. Our results reveal that both the environmental heterogeneity of monitoring plots and scale mismatches substantially impact the validation accuracy of FVC products. By applying the proposed framework, validation using high-level monitoring plots reduced uncertainty by approximately 40 % compared to using all monitoring plots (GEOV3: R2 = 0.964, RMSE = 0.075 vs. R2 = 0.830, RMSE = 0.138; GLASS: R2 = 0.957, RMSE = 0.068 vs. R2 = 0.812, RMSE = 0.121), highlighting its effectiveness in mitigating spatial representativeness errors. Furthermore, the validation results for two global FVC products (GEOV3 and GLASS) highlight systematic biases in their performance within alpine ecosystems. These findings advance validation methodologies for remote sensing products in heterogeneous landscapes and provide actionable insights for improving algorithm parameterization. The framework’s modular design enables adaptation to other critical validation scenarios requiring spatial representativeness quantification."

 Dusty weather (including dust storms, blowing dust and floating dust) represents a catastrophic weather phenomenon with extensive adverse environmental impacts. However, its natural variability and underlying mechanisms at the global scale remain insufficiently explored in prior research. This study investigates the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics and driving mechanism of global dusty weather using long-term station observations and reanalysis data. Our findings reveal a significant declining trend in dusty weather over the Taklimakan Desert and southwestern Sahara Desert from 1979 to 2023, whereas an increasing trend is observed over the northern Sahara Desert, Arabian Desert and Gobi Desert during the same period. Temporally, global dusty weather activity exhibits a decline from 1979 to 1999, followed by an interdecadal-scale oscillation with cycles of 10–14 years after 1999. The mechanistic analysis demonstrates that Atlantic climate modes—particularly the South Atlantic Subtropical Dipole (SASD) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)—play a dominant role in modulating the interdecadal variability of dust storms, with correlation coefficients of −0.44 (SASD) and 0.37 (NAO), respectively. Consequently, energy convergence over dust source regions, modulated by the SASD and NAO, stimulates low-pressure troughs and intensified westerlies in the Northern Hemisphere, alongside warm high-pressure systems in the Southern Hemisphere, both of which enhance dust storms. Our results advance the understanding of global dusty weather dynamics and offer valuable insights for future dust storms prediction."

 The global proliferation of synthetic chemicals has led to the widespread and continuous release of Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs) into the environment. CECs include pharmaceuticals, pesticides, personal care products and other industrial chemicals that pose a significant risk to both ecosystems and human health. Regulatory frameworks have predominantly targeted aquatic systems; however, mounting evidence reveals the capacity of many CECs to volatilise, aerosolise and undergo atmospheric transport. This perspective highlights the overlooked atmospheric dimension of CECs and analyses the key physicochemical parameters governing their transfer to the atmospheric domain. The results indicate that many CECs can mobilise from water or soil and undergo atmospheric transport in both the gas- and particle-phase, crossing between several environmental continua as a result. While intrinsic properties such as vapour pressure and partitioning coefficients are central to this analysis, environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, solar radiation, and transformation reactions further modulate the environmental fate and impact of CECs. We emphasise the need for environmental monitoring and regulatory frameworks to incorporate air as a critical vector for CEC dispersion and exposure. Key research priorities identified measurements of CECs in the atmosphere, further development of predictive models, and toxicity evaluation of airborne CECs to better inform policy for protecting public and environmental health."
