Integrated assessment of the environmental, social, and economic factors that determine agroforestry’s potential benefits and social acceptability is needed to effectively target agroforestry expansion. To meet this need, we used geospatial multi-criteria decision analysis to map agroforestry’s suitability across the US Midwest. We mapped priority areas where agroforestry is expected to reduce the risk of environmental degradation, provide productive tree growth, and be socially and economically viable. We show that integrating social and economic factors dramatically shifted priorities compared to an environmental-only suitability assessment. Using COMET-Planner, we estimated that expanding agroforestry to the top 5% most suitable land from our analysis (totaling 18.3 million acres) has the potential to store 43 [29–58] Mt of CO2e per year over the business-as-usual scenario. Our integrated approach can help stakeholders identify target areas for agroforestry and provides a theoretical foundation for interdisciplinary suitability mapping that can be adapted for use in other global regions."

Joseph,"Reactive nitrogen in and around the northeastern and mid-Atlantic US: sources, sinks, and connections with ozone","We use model simulations along with multiplatform, multidisciplinary observations and a range of analysis methods to estimate and understand the distributions, temporal changes, and impacts of reactive nitrogen and ozone over the most populous US region that has undergone significant environmental changes. Deposition, biogenic emissions, and extra-regional sources have been playing increasingly important roles in controlling pollutant budgets in this area as local anthropogenic emissions drop. 
 This study describes the application of a regional Earth system model with updated parameterizations for selected land–atmosphere exchange processes and multiplatform, multidisciplinary observations. We estimate reactive nitrogen (Nr = NOy+ NHx) emissions from various sources, surface and column nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and total and speciated Nr dry and wet deposition during 2018–2023 over the northeastern and mid-Atlantic US where nitrogen-oxide-limited or transitional chemical regimes dominate. The estimated Nr concentrations and deposition fluxes are related to ozone (O3) in terms of spatiotemporal variability and its key drivers as well as possible ecosystem impacts. Modeled surface O3 persistently agrees well with observations, with root mean square errors staying within 4–7 ppbv for individual years in May–June–July. Model-based surface O3–NO2 column correlation, which shows a dependency on column  formaldehyde / NO2, is higher in 2020 (r=0.62) than in other years (r=0.47–0.56). Ozone vegetative uptake overall dropped by ∼10 % from 2018 to 2023, displaying clearer downward temporal changes than total Nr deposition as declining NOy emission and deposition competed with increasing NHx fluxes. It is highlighted that temporal variabilities of Nr and O3 concentrations and fluxes on subregional to local scales respond to hydrological variability that can be influenced by precipitation and controllable human activities like irrigation. Deposition and biogenic emissions that are highly sensitive to interconnected environmental and plant physiological conditions, plus extra-regional sources (e.g., O3-rich stratospheric air and dense wildfire plumes from upwind regions), have been playing increasingly important roles in controlling pollutant budgets as local emissions decline owing to effective emission regulations and COVID lockdowns."

Zelinka;Li-Wei Chao;Timothy A. Myers;Yi Qin;Stephen A. Klein,Technical note: Recommendations for diagnosing cloud feedbacks and rapid cloud adjustments using cloud radiative kernels,"Clouds lie at the heart of uncertainty in both climate sensitivity and radiative forcing, making it imperative to properly diagnose their radiative effects. Here we provide a recommended methodology and code base for the community to use in performing such diagnoses using cloud radiative kernels. We show that properly accounting for changes in obscuration of lower-level clouds by upper-level clouds is important for accurate diagnosis and attribution of cloud feedbacks and adjustments. 
 The cloud radiative kernel method is a popular approach to quantify cloud feedbacks and rapid cloud adjustments to increased CO2 concentrations and to partition contributions from changes in cloud amount, altitude, and optical depth. However, because this method relies on cloud property histograms derived from passive satellite sensors or produced by passive satellite simulators in models, changes in obscuration of lower-level clouds by upper-level clouds can cause apparent low-cloud feedbacks and adjustments, even in the absence of changes in lower-level cloud properties. Here, we provide a methodology for properly diagnosing the impact of changing obscuration on cloud feedbacks and adjustments and quantify these effects across climate models.  Averaged globally and across global climate models, properly accounting for obscuration leads to weaker positive feedbacks from lower-level clouds and stronger positive feedbacks from upper-level clouds while simultaneously removing a mostly artificial anti-correlation between them. Given that the methodology for diagnosing cloud feedbacks and adjustments using cloud radiative kernels has evolved over several papers, and obscuration effects have only occasionally been considered in recent papers, this paper serves to establish recommended best practices and to provide a corresponding code base for community use."
10.5194/amt-18-603-2025,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,这篇论文提出了一种新颖的方法，用于评估气溶胶过滤器样品中颗粒物的吸湿性，并将其与颗粒物的化学成分联系起来。该方法能够区分无机物和有机物对总吸水量的贡献。由于美国法规的限制，近年来亲水性无机硫酸盐和硝酸盐的浓度有所下降，因此有机物（OM）的吸湿性变得更加重要。目前，常用的吸湿性测量方法，如HTDMA和EDB，无法同时获得颗粒物的吸湿性和化学成分信息。该研究通过在恒定湿度条件下对收集在特氟龙滤膜上的颗粒物进行称重，测定其吸水量，并结合化学成分分析，解决了这一难题。实验选取了硫酸铵、氯化钠、葡萄糖和丙二酸等物质进行测试，结果与E-AIM模型和以往HTDMA、EDB的研究结果一致，验证了该方法的准确性。这项新方法能够解析复杂混合物样品（例如室内和环境样品）中无机物和有机物对总吸水量的贡献，这对于深入理解大气过程和提高空气质量监测的精度具有重要意义。,"['Aerosol Hygroscopicity', 'Atmospheric Composition', 'Water Uptake', 'Air Quality Monitoring', 'Particle Composition', 'Inorganic and Organic Matter']",Nagendra Raparthi;Anthony S. Wexler;Ann M. Dillner,A novel methodology for assessing the hygroscopicity of aerosol filter samples,"Quantifying the composition-dependent hygroscopicity of aerosol particles is essential for advancing our understanding of atmospheric processes. Existing methods do not integrate chemical composition with hygroscopicity. We developed a novel method to assess the water uptake of particles sampled on aerosol filters at relative humidity levels up to 97 % and link it with their composition. This approach allows for the separation of total water uptake into inorganic and organic components. 
 Due to US regulations, concentrations of hygroscopic inorganic sulfate and nitrate have declined in recent years, leading to an increased importance of the hygroscopic nature of organic matter (OM). The hygroscopicity of OM is poorly characterized because only a fraction of the multitude of organic compounds in the atmosphere is readily measured, and there is limited information on their hygroscopic behaviors. Hygroscopicity of aerosol is traditionally measured using a humidified tandem differential mobility analyzer (HTDMA) or electrodynamic balance (EDB). EDB measures water uptake by a single particle. For ambient and chamber studies, HTDMA measurements provide water uptake and particle size information but not chemical composition. To fill this information gap, we developed a novel methodology to assess the water uptake by particles collected on Teflon filters. This method uses the same filter sample for both hygroscopicity measurements and chemical characterization, thereby providing an opportunity to link the measured hygroscopicity with ambient particle composition. To test the method, hygroscopic measurements were conducted in the laboratory for ammonium sulfate, sodium chloride, glucose, and malonic acid, which were collected on 25 mm Teflon filters using an aerosol generator and sampler. Constant-humidity solutions (CHSs), including potassium chloride, barium chloride dihydrate, and potassium sulfate, were employed in a saturated form to maintain the relative humidity (RH) at approximately 84 %, 90 %, and 97 % in small chambers. Our preliminary experiments revealed that, without the pouch, water uptake measurements were not feasible due to rapid water loss during weighing. Additionally, we observed some absorption by the aluminum pouch itself. To account for this, concurrent measurements were conducted for both the loaded and the blank filters at each RH level. Thus, the dry loaded and blank Teflon filters were placed in aluminum pouches with one side open and in RH-controlled chambers for more than 24 h. The wet loaded samples and wet blanks were then weighed using an ultramicrobalance to determine the water uptake by the respective compound and the blank Teflon filter. The net amount of water absorbed by each compound was calculated by subtracting the water uptake of the blank filter from that of the wet loaded filter. Hygroscopic parameters, including the water-to-solute (W / S) ratio, molality, mass fraction solute (mfs), and growth factors (GFs), were calculated from the measurements. The results obtained are consistent with those reported by the Extended Aerosol Inorganics Model (E-AIM) and previous studies utilizing HTDMA and EDB for these compounds, highlighting the accuracy of this new methodology. This new approach enables the hygroscopicity and chemical composition of individual filter samples to be assessed so that in complex mixtures, such as chamber and ambient samples, the total water uptake can be parsed between the inorganic and organic components of the aerosol."

A new version of these data products has recently been released; however, these new products must be validated against other datasets to ensure their validity. This study presents such an assessment, using measurements from 11 satellite instruments to characterize the new MAESTRO products. In the stratosphere, good agreement is found for ozone and acceptable agreement is found for NO2 with these other datasets. 
 Launched aboard the Canadian SCISAT satellite in August 2003, the Measurement of Aerosol Extinction in the Stratosphere and Troposphere Retrieved by Occultation (MAESTRO) instrument has been measuring solar absorption spectra in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible part of the spectrum for more than 20 years. The UV-channel measurements from MAESTRO are used to retrieve   profiles of  ozone from the short-wavelength end of the Chappuis band (UV-ozone) and NO2, while measurements made in the visible part of the spectrum are used to retrieve a separate ozone (Vis-ozone) product. The latest  ozone and NO2 profile products, version 4.5, have been released, and they initially cover the period from February 2004 to December 2023, although they will continue to be updated. The version 4.5 retrieval algorithm represents an improvement from previous versions, with changes including updated pressure and temperature input information, an improved algorithm for high-Sun reference spectrum calculation, improved Rayleigh scattering modelling, and the change to a Twomey–Tikhonov inversion algorithm from a Chahine relaxation technique. Due to the buildup of an unknown contaminant, the UV-ozone and NO2 products are only viable  up to June 2009 for NO2 and December 2009 for UV-ozone. This study presents comparisons of the version 4.5 MAESTRO ozone and NO2 measurements with coincident (both spatially and temporally) measurements from an ensemble of 11 other satellite limb-viewing instruments. In the stratosphere, the Vis-ozone product was found to possess a small high bias, with stratosphere-averaged relative differences between 2.3 % and 8.2 %, although good agreement with the comparison datasets was found overall. A similar bias, albeit with slightly poorer agreement, is found for the UV-ozone product in the stratosphere, with the average stratospheric agreement  between MAESTRO and the other datasets ranging from 2.8 % to 11.9 %. For NO2, general agreement with the comparison datasets is only found in the range from 20 to 40 km. Within this range, MAESTRO is found to have a low bias for NO2, and most of the datasets agree to within 27.2 %, although the average agreement ranges from 8.5 % to 43.4 %."

It also provides definitions, typologies and methods to aid consistent classification, estimation and reporting of the various residues and by-products. 
 Agricultural, fishery, forestry and agro-processing activities produce large quantities of residues, by-products and waste materials every year. Inappropriate disposal and inefficient use of these resources contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and non-point pollution, placing significant environmental and economic burdens on society. Since many nations do not keep statistics on these materials, it has not been possible to accurately quantify the amounts produced, their competing uses and the quantities potentially available for recycling at a local level. Therefore, the objectives of the present work were to provide (1) definitions, typologies and methods to aid consistent classification, estimation and reporting of the various residues and by-products, (2) a global organic matter database (OMD) of residues and by-products from agriculture, fisheries, forestry and related industries and (3) regional and global estimates of residues and by-products potentially available for use in a circular bio-economy. To the best of our knowledge, the OMD is the first of its kind to consolidate quantities and nutrient concentrations of residues and by-products globally from agriculture, fisheries, forestry and related industries (available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10450921; Sileshi et al., 2024). The OMD will be updated continuously as new production data are published in FAOSTAT and country-specific conversion coefficients become available. This information is expected to contribute to evidence-based policies and actions in support of sustainable utilization and the transition towards a circular economy. The database could be used for a variety of purposes, including estimation of residue availability for soil amendment, livestock feed, bioenergy and other industrial applications as well as assessment of the environmental impacts of residue management practices such as soil application and burning. The estimates in the OMD are only available at the national level. Due to the lack of a uniform methodology, conversion coefficients and data on competing uses across countries, it was difficult to accurately estimate the quantities of all agricultural, fishery and forestry residues and by-products. Therefore, we strongly recommend investment in the inventory of agricultural, fishery and forestry residues as well as by-products and wastes at the national and sub-national levels for use in a circular bio-economy."

 We present a machine learning dataset for tree species classification in Sentinel-2 satellite image time series of bottom-of-atmosphere reflectance.

We found that (i) the surface Indian Ocean has the highest levels of pollution, (ii) pollution from previous decades is sinking in the North Atlantic and Pacific Ocean, and (iii) waters carrying Pb pollution are spreading from the Southern Ocean throughout the Southern Hemisphere at intermediate depths. 
 Lead (Pb) and its isotopes are a powerful tool to study the pathways of Pb pollution from land to sea and, simultaneously, investigate biogeochemical processes in the ocean. However, the scarcity and sparsity of in situ measurements of Pb concentrations and isotope compositions do not allow for a comprehensive understanding of Pb pollution pathways and biogeochemical cycling on a global scale. Here, we present three machine learning models developed to map seawater Pb concentrations and isotope compositions leveraging the global GEOTRACES dataset as well as historical data. The models use climatologies of oceanographic and atmospheric variables as features from which to predict Pb concentrations, 206Pb/207Pb, and 208Pb/207Pb. Using Shapley Additive Values (SHAP), we found that seawater temperature, atmospheric dust and black carbon, and salinity are the most important features for predicting Pb concentrations. Dissolved oxygen concentration, salinity, temperature, and atmospheric dust are the most important features for predicting 206Pb/207Pb, while atmospheric black carbon and dust, seawater temperature, and surface chlorophyll-a for 208Pb/207Pb. Our model outputs show that (i) the surface Indian Ocean has the highest levels of pollution, (ii) pollution from previous decades is sinking in the North Atlantic and Pacific Ocean, and (iii) waters characterised by a highly anthropogenic Pb isotope fingerprint are spreading from the Southern Ocean throughout the Southern Hemisphere at intermediate depths. By analysing the uncertainty associated with our maps, we identified the Southern Ocean as the key area to prioritise in future sampling campaigns.

The original model used a simplified method, but we developed a more accurate approach. We found that this method significantly changes the properties of the estimated aerosols and their effects on radiation, especially for dust aerosols. It also impacts the simulated weather conditions. Our work highlights the importance of correctly representing aerosol–radiation interactions in models. 
 WRF-Chem (Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry) is widely used to assess regional aerosol radiative feedback. However, in the current version, aerosol optical properties are only calculated in four shortwave bands, while only two of them are used to interpolate optical properties towards the 14 shortwave bands used in the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for Global Climate Models (RRTMG) scheme. In this study, we use a “Resolved” algorithm to estimate aerosol radiative feedback in WRF-Chem, in which aerosol optical properties are calculated in all 14 shortwave bands. The impacts of changing this calculation algorithm are then evaluated. The simulation results of aerosol optical properties are quite different using the new Resolved algorithm, especially for dust aerosols. The alteration of aerosol optical properties results in considerably different aerosol radiative effects: the dust radiative forcing in the atmosphere simulated by the Resolved algorithm is about 2 times larger than the original “Interpolated” algorithm. The dust radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) simulated by the Interpolated algorithm is negative in the Sahara region, while the Resolved algorithm simulates positive forcing at TOA and can exceed 10 W m−2 in the Sahara, which is more consistent with previous studies. The modification also leads to changes in meteorological fields due to alterations in radiative feedback effects of aerosols. The near-surface temperature is changed due to the difference in the radiation budget at the bottom of the atmosphere (BOT) and the heating effects of aerosols at the surface. Furthermore, the amendment of the algorithm partially corrects the wind field and temperature simulation bias compared to the reanalysis data. The difference in planet boundary layer height can reach up to ∼100 m in China and ∼200 m in the Sahara, which also results in a greater surface haze. The results show that correcting the estimation algorithm of aerosol radiative effects is necessary in WRF-Chem."

The productivity of grasslands hinges on the availability of soil reactive nitrogen, which is highly sensitive to climatic variations. Using an extensive synthesis of 1242 experimental observations, reinforced by multiple models, we show that warming as a single driver of climate change intensifies nitrogen dynamics in grasslands. This could lead to increases in net primary productivity of 1% to 9% and escalate nitrogen leakage into the environment by 22% to 141%. Under the warming SSP2-4.5 scenario, we foresee an annual boost of 17 million tons per year (Tg yr–1) of nitrogen inputs, predominantly via biological nitrogen fixation, compared to the baseline scenario by 2050. Total nitrogen harvest is projected to climb by 12 Tg yr–1. However, the nitrogen surplus surge is expected to increase by 5 Tg yr–1, potentially intensifying nitrogen pollution. To counter this, adaptation measures must aim at curtailing reactive nitrogen losses while preserving  increased nitrogen harvest. This could reduce nitrogen input and surplus by 10 and 20 Tg yr–1, respectively, while boosting nitrogen harvest by 10 Tg yr–1, potentially yielding economic gains of up to 121 billion USD by 2050. In shaping climate change adaptation policies, it is critical to balance the potential benefits and drawbacks of forging effective management approaches."

Here, we conducted a field campaign with measurements of H2O2 and related species at a tower-based site (∼528 m above the ground surface) of Beijing in spring of 2022. The observed hourly H2O2 concentration reached up to 21.2 ppbv with an average value of 3.4 ± 3.7 ppbv during the entire observation period, which was higher than values from previous observations throughout the world. The H2O2 budget revealed that the two known sources (self-reaction of HO2 radicals and ozonolysis of alkenes) could not account for the significant formation of H2O2, leading to a considerable unknown source strength (∼0.14–0.53 ppbv h–1) of H2O2 at noon and after sunset. Based on the levoglucosan signal, distribution of fire points, and backward trajectories, biomass burning emissions from the southwest of Beijing (e.g., North China Plain) were found to contribute greatly to H2O2 formation. Besides, photochemical aging of PM2.5 might also have a potential impact on H2O2 production at noon. The unexpectedly high concentrations of H2O2 aloft made a vital contribution to sulfate production (0.2–1.1 μg m–3 h–1), which could be transported to the ground surface during the turbulent mixing. Our findings provide an improved understanding of the H2O2 chemistry in the boundary layer aloft in a megacity, as well as its impact on sulfate formation."

Earth system model simulations with integrated marine isoprene emissions demonstrate substantial alterations in atmospheric composition over global oceanic regions. Our investigation uncovers diurnal variations in the vertical profiles of atmospheric isoprene, indicating that surface isoprene can ascend to the mid-to-upper troposphere, where nitrogen monoxide (NO) influences isoprene epoxydiol (IEPOX) production differently over selected oceanic and terrestrial regions.

To overcome these challenges, this study proposed a reconstruction-esterification strategy for the development of advanced NF membranes. Results showed that the combination of Na3PO4 solution post-treatment and polyol molecule grafting generated a thinner active layer with smaller and more uniform pores. More importantly, the critical role of alkaline post-treatment in reducing the residual amine groups of polyamide layers was revealed, which enhanced the chlorine resistance of membranes jointly with the effect of surface esterification. In comparison with the surface water purification performance of several commercial NF membranes, the obtained esterified membrane showed excellent selectivity between natural organic matter and salts, along with a reasonable water permeance. Moreover, the higher and stable removal capacity of the esterified membrane for disinfection byproducts and their precursors demonstrated its application advantage in the potential chlorination-NF-coupled process.

We investigated UVB disinfection, a key mechanism of solar disinfection commonly employed in developing countries, targeting murine norovirus vesicles and free murine noroviruses as surrogates for human noroviruses. At low viral concentrations of 109 gene copies per liter, viral infectivity loss as quantified by the integrated cell culture-reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (ICC-RT-qPCR) indicated that vesicles were 1.51 to 1.73 times more resistant to disinfection compared to free viruses. Virus inactivation was primarily due to protein damage as quantified by bicinchoninic acid and Western blot assays, and the damage of virus binding to host cells as quantified by RT-qPCR. Molecular simulations predicted that the oxidation of a tyrosine residue in the viral protein 1 prohibited binding. UVB irradiation of viral/vesicle proteins resulted in 1O2 formation as quantified by time-resolved phosphorescence, and for the first time, endogenous 1O2 was confirmed to contribute to virus inactivation by UVB.

The biocidal properties of fungicides may negatively impact the stability of intestinal microbiota, thereby posing a threat to intestinal health. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of intestinal damage and functional abnormalities in grass carp following a 42-day exposure to the widely used fungicide carbendazim at environmentally relevant concentrations (0.2 to 20 μg/L). Histopathological observations, mRNA and protein expression analyses, biochemical analysis, quantification of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), cytokines, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA), as well as internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing, were performed. At environmentally relevant concentrations, carbendazim strongly induced intestinal inflammation, leading to increased transcriptional and translational levels of genes involved in the toll-like receptor five (TLR5)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway, including TLR5, NF-κB, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα). Additionally, carbendazim damaged intestinal barriers and reduced the expression of tight junction proteins (e.g., occludin and zonula occludens-1/2), goblet cells, and immunoglobulin M levels, while also disrupting the gut microbiome, leading to intestinal metabolic disorders, particularly decreases in SCFAs and increases in LPS. Treatment with the TLR5 antagonist TH1020 mitigated intestinal inflammation caused by carbendazim, subsequently improving mechanical barrier function. Overall, our findings provide new insights into the toxicological mechanisms underlying intestinal damage caused by carbendazim in grass carp, indicating that carbendazim poses a significant threat to nontarget organisms. Given its widespread detection in the environment, these results underscore the substantial ecological risks to the gut health of fish living in carbendazim-contaminated water bodies."

However, low‐resolution Earth system models often underestimate the frequency of blocking, undermining confidence in future projections. In this study, we use the high‐resolution Community Earth System Model (CESM‐HR; 25 km atm and 10 km ocean) to show that CESM‐HR reduces biases in atmospheric blocking for both winter and summer, particularly for events lasting longer than 10 days. This improvement is partly due to reduced sea surface temperature biases at higher resolution. Additionally, applying a bias correction to the 500 hPa geopotential height further enhances blocking frequency simulations, highlighting the crucial role of the mean state. Under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario, CESM‐HR projects a decrease in wintertime blocking over regions such as the Euro‐Atlantic and Chukchi‐Alaska, consistent with previous studies. In contrast, summer blocking is expected to become more frequent and persistent, driven by weakened zonal winds. The blocking center shifts from historical locations over Scandinavia and eastern Russia to central Eurasia, significantly increasing blocking over the Ural region. Summer blocking frequency over the Scandinavia‐Ural region may eventually surpass historical winter blocking over the Euro‐Atlantic. This increase in summer blocking could exacerbate summer heatwaves in a warming climate, making severe heatwaves, like those observed recently, more common in the future."

This study explores spring temperature changes on the southern Tibetan Plateau during the 8.2 ka cold event through simulations forced by North Atlantic freshwater hosing. Simulation results reveal anomalous warming on the southern Tibetan Plateau due to hosing‐induced AMOC slowdown. This warming was primary caused by the increase of net solar flux and the presence of an anomalous warm anticyclone over the Tibetan Plateau. The enhanced net solar flux resulted from the decrease in snowfall, which led to a reduction in albedo. The snowfall was mainly reduced by the decrease in westerly moisture transport, resulting from weakened lower‐level westerlies induced by AMOC‐driven climate variabilities over the North Atlantic and tropical Indian Ocean. The warm anticyclone was induced by the anomalous vertical northerly shear over the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, which resulted from enhanced diabatic heating released by Asian monsoon rainfall. Asian monsoon rainfall increased due to anomalous lower‐level cyclone over the tropical Indian Ocean. This anomalous cyclone was induced by the Mastuno‐Gill response over the tropical Indian Ocean and amplified by a wave train propagating from the North Atlantic, both of which were resulted from the AMOC slowdown. The AMOC weakening is likely to play an important role in the recent and ongoing amplification of spring warming on the southern Tibetan Plateau."

The overall climate effect of rBC depends on its spatial distribution and atmospheric lifetime, both of which are impacted by the efficiency with which rBC is transported or removed by convective systems. These processes are poorly constrained by observations. It is especially interesting to investigate rBC transport efficiency through the Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM) since this meteorological pattern delivers vast quantities of boundary layer air from Asia, where rBC emissions are high to the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UT/LS) where the lifetime of rBC is expected to be long. Here, we present in situ observations of rBC made during the Asian Summer Monsoon Chemistry and Climate Impact Project of summer, 2022. We use observed relationships between rBC and CO in ASM outflow to show that rBC is removed nearly completely (>98%) from uplifted air and that rBC concentrations in ASM outflow are statistically indistinguishable from the UT/LS background. We compare observed rBC and CO concentrations to those expected based on two chemical transport models and find that the models reproduce CO to within a factor of 2 at all altitudes whereas rBC is overpredicted by a factor of 20–100 at altitudes associated with ASM outflow. We find that the rBC particles in recently convected air have thinner coatings than those found in the UTLS background, suggesting transport of a small number of rBC particles that are negligible for concentration."

This method allows us to identify three major climate modes: the trend component, the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The trend component mainly reflects warming in the middle and upper troposphere over the south of the TP rather than the low land surface temperature changes. Furthermore, we found that water vapor δ18O in these upper atmospheric layers positively correlates with temperature. We propose that the up‐and‐over transport of such water vapor to the TP contributes to the temperature signal in the ice core δ18O record, which also helps understand the increasing trend in TP ice core δ18O records during the last deglaciation. ENSO and PDO affect the intensity of the ASM through two phases: warm phases tend to weaken the monsoon, leading to higher δ18O values, whereas cool phases strengthen the monsoon, resulting in lower δ18O values. Our findings suggest that multiple climate forcings can have their specific isotopic imprints in isotopic archives and highlight the importance of analyzing the integrated effects of diverse climatic drivers. The analyses also shed light on separating different climate signals from paleoclimate records."
10.1029/2024JD041872,False,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文利用探空仪观测和ERA5再分析数据，研究了2002年和2019年南极洲两次南半球爆发性平流层增温事件期间，对流层顶和对流层顶逆温层在时空上的变化及其机制。研究发现，在两次SSW事件后，对流层顶逆温层更陡峭，对流层顶更暖且更低。在2002年和2019年主要和次要SSW事件的快速增温开始以及极地涡旋最终崩溃后，这些异常现象的幅度增加并达到各自的第一个峰值。在2002年和2019年的SSW事件和极地涡旋最终崩溃期间，由行星波驱动的平流层平均残差环流是这些异常现象的主要原因。对流层顶上方异常下沉的平均残差环流的绝热加热导致对流层顶高度降低和对流层顶温度升高。它还通过动力加热增加了对流层顶附近的静态稳定性，这代表着对流层顶逆温层的增强。此外，2002年和2019年对流层顶逆温层强度的增强分别约有4%和1.9%可归因于对流层顶反气旋环流的增强。总的来说，该研究集中于对流层顶和对流层顶逆温层在南极洲SSW事件中的动力学和热力学响应，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。,"['tropopause', 'tropopause inversion layer', 'stratospheric sudden warming', 'radiosonde', 'ERA5 reanalysis', 'planetary waves', 'polar vortex']",Lingyun Yang;Shaodong Zhang;Chunming Huang;Kaiming Huang;Yun Gong;Zheng Ma;Jiahui Luo;Rui Wang,Lowering of Tropopause and Strengthening of Tropopause Inversion Layer at Antarctica During the 2002 and 2019 Southern Sudden Stratospheric Warming Events as Seen by Radiosonde Observations and ERA5 Reanalysis,"Using radiosonde and ERA5 reanalysis data, we investigated the spatial and temporal variations in the tropopause and tropopause inversion layer (TIL) in the Antarctic region during the 2002 and 2019 southern sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events and the mechanism involved. Following these SSW events there was a sharper TIL and a warmer and lower tropopause. After the onset of rapid warming during the major SSW event in 2002 and the minor SSW event in 2019, the magnitudes of these anomalies increased and reached their respective first peaks. The anomalies increased and peaked again following the early final breakdown of the polar vortex (i.e., the switch to summer circulation). During the SSW events and final breakdown of the polar vortex in 2002 and 2019, stratospheric residual mean circulation, which was driven by planetary waves, was the primary cause of these anomalies. The adiabatic heating of the anomalous downwelling residual mean circulation above the tropopause led to a decrease in the tropopause height and a warming of the tropopause temperature. It also led to increased static stability near the tropopause by dynamical heating, which represented a strengthened TIL. In addition, approximately 4% and 1.9% of the strengthening of the TIL in 2002 and 2019, respectively, can be attributed to the increased anticyclonic circulation at the tropopause."

Nonetheless, due to complications that have both to do with the complexity of the source and required equipment, this has only been done in a few studies to date. Here we report on the design and implementation of an instrument to perform simultaneous, multi‐band optical and radio observations of lightning, which aims to provide a fast and simple way to routinely measure its temperature. The primary instrument includes photometers to measure temperature and electric field sensors to identify lightning sub‐processes. Data are analyzed in tandem with 2D and 3D lightning location information. To measure the temperature, the photometer array includes 3 channels equipped with narrowband filters (1 nm) centered at bright atomic oxygen lines in the near‐infrared, and temperature is given from the relative intensity of optical emissions across the 3 channels. We found the average peak temperature of 44 negative cloud‐to‐ground lightning return strokes to be 17,600 K. Additionally, the peak temperature had no apparent correlation to the peak current. Comparisons between 777 nm observations from the ground and from space by the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) emphasize the picture that the instruments in these two vantage points tend to see different portions of the lightning flash. They also reveal that dart leaders play a key role in the interpretation of lightning observations from space."

Li,The Contrasting Roles of Land and Oceanic Moisture Contributions to Summer Rainfall Over the Southeastern United States,"Summer precipitation in the Southeast United States (SEUS) is classified into three categories—light, moderate, and heavy—using a Bayesian statistical model. We find that heavy rainfall events explain most of the interannual variance of summertime cumulative precipitation in the region, influencing regional hydroclimate patterns. For each rainfall category, we track the respective moisture sources using the 2‐Layers Water Accounting Model driven by reanalysis data. We find that the Atlantic Ocean is the primary moisture source across all rainfall categories and becomes more important with increasing rainfall intensity. Conversely, land moisture contributions decrease with rainfall intensity. In the case of heavy rainfall, the moisture originating from the Atlantic Ocean is transported to the SEUS via a southeastward positioning of the North Atlantic Subtropical High (NASH) Western Ridge. The ample supply of moisture fluxes is further propelled by reduced surface pressure which promotes ascending motion in the SEUS. Analysis of mid‐troposphere circulation indicates that this anomalous low‐pressure might stem from wave trains originating over the North Pacific Ocean. Thus, heavy rainfall events involve increased Atlantic Ocean moisture fluxes directed by the NASH to the SEUS, which, in turn, is modulated by anomalous atmospheric circulation produced over the Pacific Ocean. Furthermore, we observe that the heavy and moderate (light) rainfall event frequency has increased (decreased) by five days throughout the 1970–2019 analysis period."

Amplitudes of momentum fluxes of parameterized gravity waves (GWs) are intensified since they are determined by the square of convective heating tendency. In addition, stronger planetary waves are simulated in E3SMv2 with the convection scheme update, partially due to the tropospheric precipitation change.

 Place cells in the hippocampus and grid cells in the entorhinal cortex are elements of a neural map of self position1–5. For these cells to benefit navigation, their representation must be dynamically related to the surrounding locations2. A candidate mechanism for linking places along an animal’s path has been described for place cells, in which the sequence of spikes in each cycle of the hippocampal theta oscillation encodes a trajectory from the animal’s current location towards upcoming locations6–8. In mazes that bifurcate, such trajectories alternately traverse the two upcoming arms when the animal approaches the choice point9,10, raising the possibility that the trajectories express available forward paths encoded on previous trials10. However, to bridge the animal’s path with the wider environment, beyond places previously or subsequently visited, an experience-independent spatial sampling mechanism might be required. Here we show in freely moving rats that in individual theta cycles, ensembles of grid cells and place cells encode a position signal that sweeps linearly outwards from the animal’s location into the ambient environment, with sweep direction alternating stereotypically between left and right across successive theta cycles. These sweeps are accompanied by, and aligned with, a similarly alternating directional signal in a discrete population of parasubiculum cells that have putative connections to grid cells via conjunctive grid × direction cells. Sweeps extend into never-visited locations that are inaccessible to the animal. Sweeps persist during REM sleep. The sweep directions can be explained by an algorithm that maximizes the cumulative coverage of the surrounding manifold space. The sustained and unconditional expression of theta-patterned left–right-alternating sweeps in the entorhinal–hippocampal positioning system provides an efficient ‘look around’ mechanism for sampling locations beyond the travelled path. A study in rats proposes a mechanism for how the brain maps the surrounding environment, including places it has never seen, by alternating left and right forward sweeps in successive theta cycles."

 Surface crevassing on the Greenland Ice Sheet is a large source of uncertainty in processes controlling mass loss due to a lack of comprehensive observations of their location and evolution through time. Here we use high-resolution digital elevation models to map the three-dimensional volume of crevasse fields across the Greenland Ice Sheet in 2016 and 2021. We show that, between the two years, large and significant increases in crevasse volume occurred at marine-terminating sectors with accelerating flow (up to +25.3 ± 10.1% in the southeast sector), while the change in total ice-sheet-wide crevasse volume was within measurement error (+4.3 ± 5.9%). The sectoral increases were offset by a reduction in crevasse volume in the central west sector (−14.2 ± 3.2%), particularly at Sermeq Kujalleq (Jakobshavn Isbræ), which exhibited slowdown and thickening over the study period. Changes in crevasse volume correlate strongly with antecedent discharge changes, indicating that the acceleration of ice flow in Greenland forces significant increases in crevassing on a timescale of less than five years. This response provides a mechanism for mass-loss-promoting feedbacks on sub-decadal timescales, including increased calving, faster flow and accelerated water transfer to the bed.

 Cancer remains a major health challenge, with the effectiveness of chemotherapy often limited by its lack of specificity and systemic toxicity. Nanotechnology, particularly in targeted drug delivery, has emerged as a key innovation to address these limitations. This study introduces lipoic acid-boronophenylalanine (LA-BPA) derivatives that incorporate short-chain polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a spacer. These derivatives distinctively self-assemble into vesicles under specific pH conditions, exhibiting a pH-dependent reversible assembly characteristic. Notably, these vesicles target cancer cells by binding to sialic acid via phenylboronic acid groups, subsequently depleting cellular glutathione and elevating reactive oxygen species, thereby inducing apoptosis via mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy. The vesicles demonstrate high efficiency in encapsulating doxorubicin, featuring a glutathione-responsive release mechanism, which present a promising option for tumor therapy. Additionally, the derivatives of the B-10 isotope, containing up to 1.6% boron, are engineered for incorporation into LPB-3-based vesicles. This design facilitates their application in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) alongside chemotherapy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Our findings highlight the potential of LA-BPA derivatives in developing more precise, effective, and less detrimental chemoradiotherapy approaches, marking an advancement in nanomedicine for cancer treatment.

Here the authors show that lysosomes and lysosomal acid lipase play a critical role in adipocyte lipolysis with fasting in mice. 
 Physiological adaptations to fasting enable humans to survive for prolonged periods without food and involve molecular pathways that may drive life-prolonging effects of dietary restriction in model organisms. Mobilization of fatty acids and glycerol from adipocyte lipid stores by canonical neutral lipases, including the rate limiting adipose triglyceride lipase (Pnpla2/ATGL), is critical to the adaptive fasting response. Here we discovered an alternative mechanism of lipolysis in adipocytes involving a lysosomal program. We functionally tested lysosomal lipolysis with pharmacological and genetic approaches in mice and in murine and human adipocyte and adipose tissue explant culture, establishing dependency on lysosomal acid lipase (LIPA/LAL) and the microphthalmia/transcription factor E (MiT/TFE) family. Our study establishes a model whereby the canonical pathway is critical for rapid lipolytic responses to adrenergic stimuli operative in the acute stage of fasting, while the alternative lysosomal pathway dominates with prolonged fasting. Survival during fasting requires release of adipose tissue lipid stores and is thought to be dependent on canonical lipases, including the rate limiting action of adipose triglyceride lipase. Here the authors show that lysosomes and lysosomal acid lipase play a critical role in adipocyte lipolysis with fasting in mice."

 Treatment of solid tumors remains challenging and therapeutic strategies require continuous development. Tumor-infiltrating macrophages play a pivotal role in tumor dynamics. Here, we present a Macrophage-Drug Conjugate (MDC) platform technology that enables loading macrophages with ferritin-drug complexes. We first show that macrophages actively take up human heavy chain ferritin (HFt) in vitro via macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (MSR1). We further manifest that drug-loaded macrophages transfer ferritin to adjacent cancer cells through a process termed ‘TRAnsfer of Iron-binding protein’ (TRAIN). The TRAIN process requires direct cell-to-cell contact and an immune synapse-like structure. At last, MDCs with various anti-cancer drugs are formulated with their safety and anti-tumor efficacy validated in multiple syngeneic mice and orthotopic human tumor models via different routes of administration. Importantly, MDCs can be prepared in advance and used as thawed products, supporting their clinical applicability. This MDC approach thus represents a promising advancement in the therapeutic landscape for solid tumors. Treatment strategy of solid tumors requires continuous development.

Moreno-Yruela et al. provide cryo-EM structures and identify the mechanisms of substrate specificity and a unique nucleosome-binding domain. 
 Chromatin-modifying enzymes target distinct residues within histones to finetune gene expression profiles. SIRT7 is an NAD+-dependent deacylase often deregulated in cancer, which deacetylates either H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) or H3K18 with high specificity within nucleosomes. Here, we report structures of nucleosome-bound SIRT7, and uncover the structural basis of its specificity towards H3K36 and K18 deacylation, combining a mechanism-based cross-linking strategy, cryo-EM, and enzymatic and cellular assays. We show that the SIRT7 N-terminus represents a unique, extended nucleosome-binding domain, reaching across the nucleosomal surface to the acidic patch. The catalytic domain binds at the H3-tail exit site, engaging both DNA gyres of the nucleosome. Contacting H3K36 versus H3K18 requires a change in binding pose, and results in structural changes in both SIRT7 and the nucleosome. These structures reveal the basis of lysine specificity, allowing us to engineer SIRT7 towards enhanced H3K18ac selectivity, and provides a basis for small molecule modulator development.

 Identifying and characterizing virulence proteins secreted by Gram-negative bacteria are fundamental for deciphering microbial pathogenicity as well as aiding the development of therapeutic strategies. Effector predictors utilizing pre-trained protein language models (PLMs) have shown sound performance by leveraging extensive evolutionary and sequential protein features. However, the accuracy and sensitivity of effector prediction remain challenging. Here, we introduce a model named Contrastive-learning of Language Embedding and Biological Features (CLEF) leveraging contrastive learning to integrate PLM representations with supplementary biological features. Biologically information is captured in learned contextualized embeddings to yield meaningful representations. With cross-modality biological features, CLEF outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in predicting type III, type IV, and type VI secreted effectors (T3SEs/T4SEs/T6SEs) in enteric pathogens. All experimentally verified effectors in Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and 41 of 43 experimentally verified T3SEs of Salmonella Typhimurium are recognized. Moreover, 12 predicted T3SEs and 11 predicted T6SEs are validated by extensive experiments in Edwardsiella piscicida. Furthermore, integrating omics data via CLEF framework enhances protein representations to illustrate effector-effector interactions and determine in vivo colonization-essential genes. Collectively, CLEF provides a blueprint to bridge the gap between in silico PLM’s capacity and experimental biological information to fulfill complicated tasks.

Here, the authors report that integrating NiFe sulfides with MXene enhances oxygen evolution reaction efficiency and stability, achieving 1000 hours of durability in seawater electrolysis. 
 Anion exchange membrane seawater electrolysis is vital for future large-scale green hydrogen production, however enduring a huge challenge that lacks high-stable oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysts. Herein, we report a robust OER electrocatalyst for AEMSE by integrating MXene (Ti3C2) with NiFe sulfides ((Ni,Fe)S2@Ti3C2). The strong interaction between (Ni,Fe)S2 and Ti3C2 induces electron distribution to trigger lattice oxygen mechanism, improving the intrinsic activity, and particularly prohibits the dissolution of Fe species during OER process via the Ti-O-Fe bonding effectively, achieving notable stability. Furthermore, the good retention of sulfates and the abundant groups of Ti3C2 provide effective Cl- resistance. Accordingly, (Ni,Fe)S2@Ti3C2 achieves high OER activity (1.598 V@2 A cm-2) and long-term durability (1000 h) in seawater system. Furthermore, AEMSE with industrial current density (0.5 A cm-2) and durability (500 h) is achieved by (Ni,Fe)S2@Ti3C2 anode and Raney Ni cathode with electrolysis efficiency of 70% and energy consumption of 48.4 kWh kg-1 H2.

 In recent years, numerous studies have explored the relationship between atmospheric conditions and respiratory viral infections. However, these investigations have faced certain limitations, such as the use of modestly sized datasets, a restricted geographical focus, and an emphasis on a limited number of respiratory pathogens. This study aimed to develop a nationwide respiratory virus infection risk prediction model through machine learning approach. We utilized the CRFC algorithm, a random forest-based method for multi-label classification, to predict the presence of various respiratory viruses. The model integrated binary classification outcomes for each virus category and incorporated air quality and meteorological data to enhance its accuracy. The data was collected from 31 regions in China between 2016 and 2021, encompassing pathogen detection, air quality indices, and meteorological measurements. The model’s performance was evaluated using ROC curves, AUC scores, and precision-recall curves. Our model demonstrated robust performance across various metrics, with an average overall accuracy of 0.76, macro sensitivity of 0.75, macro precision of 0.77, and an average AUC score of 0.9. The SHAP framework was employed to interpret the model’s predictions, revealing significant contributions from parameters such as age, NO2 levels, and meteorological conditions. Our model provides a reliable tool for predicting respiratory virus risks, with a comprehensive integration of environmental and clinical data. The model’s performance metrics indicate its potential utility in clinical decision-making and public health planning.

 Terrigenous organic matter in marine sediments is considered a significant long-term carbon sink, yet our knowledge regarding its source taxa is severely limited. Here, we leverage land-plant ancient DNA from six globally distributed marine sediment cores covering the Last Glacial–Holocene transition as a proxy for the share, burial rate, preservation, and composition of terrigenous organic matter. We show that the spatial and temporal plant composition as revealed by sedimentary ancient DNA records reflects mainly the vegetation dynamics of nearby continents as revealed by comparison with pollen from land archives. However, we also find indications of a global north-to-south translocation of sedimentary ancient DNA. We also find that plant sedimentary ancient DNA has a higher burial rate in samples from the Late Glacial, which is characterized by high runoff and mineral load. This study provides an approach to understanding the global linkages between the terrestrial and marine carbon cycle, highlighting the need for further research to quantify the processes of DNA preservation and dispersal in marine sediments.

 Oil contamination in coastal wetlands jeopardizes these ecosystems and worsens climate warming. Here we analyze 87 metagenomic samples from representative Chinese wetland oilfields and find that genes associated with dissimilatory iron reduction respond to hydrocarbon levels. These genes were closely linked to the breakdown of organic matter into carbon dioxide and methane, highlighting the potential of dissimilatory iron reduction for degrading stubborn hydrocarbons and altering electron transfer pathways. Notably, Geobacter, a key genus for dissimilatory iron reduction, showed strong correlation with iron(II) production and hydrocarbon degradation. To validate these findings, a targeted enhancement of dissimilatory iron reduction with external iron oxide and Geobacter maximized carbon removal, transforming organic-bound fraction of iron into carbonate-bound fraction. The intensified iron reduction process reduced methane emissions by 38–40% and strengthened microbial interactions by redirecting electron transfer in carbon flow. Our study innovatively mitigates pollution and reduces methane emissions in oil-contaminated wetlands.
