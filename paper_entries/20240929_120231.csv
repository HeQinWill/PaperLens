10.5194/acp-24-10893-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究利用全球导航卫星系统（GNSS）无线电掩星观测数据，对 2007 年至 2019 年间发生的八次主要北半球突然平流层增温事件进行了分析。研究重点关注平流层增温与阻塞事件之间的关系，以及它们对极地对流层顶的影响。研究结果表明，平流层增温事件之前，平流层中存在明显的向上 Eliassen-Palm 通量峰值，并且在七次事件中，该峰值之前在对流层中也存在明显的峰值。研究还发现，平流层增温事件会导致极地对流层顶逆温层的增强，并且这种增强在吸收型事件中更为明显。总体而言，该研究提供了对主要平流层增温事件的观测视角，包括其与阻塞事件的联系以及对极地对流层顶的影响。,"['stratospheric warming', 'blocking', 'satellite observations', 'radio occultation', 'global navigation satellite system (GNSS)', 'atmospheric circulation', 'polar vortex', 'tropopause']",Kamilya Yessimbet;Andrea K. Steiner;Florian Ladstädter;Albert Ossó,Observational perspective on sudden stratospheric warmings and blocking from Eliassen–Palm fluxes,"Major sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs) and atmospheric blocking can markedly influence winter extratropical surface weather. To study the relationship between SSWs and blocking, we examine dynamic stratosphere–troposphere coupling using vertically highly resolved observations from global navigation satellite system radio occultation for 2007–2019. Our results provide a purely observational view of the evolution of major SSWs, their link to blocking, and their effect on the polar tropopause. 
 In this study, we examine eight major boreal sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events between 2007 and 2019 to understand the vertical coupling between the troposphere and stratosphere as well as the relationship between SSWs and blocking events using global navigation satellite system (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) observations. Our study covers the main aspects of SSW events, including the vertical structure of planetary-wave propagation, static stability, geometry of the polar vortex, and occurrence of blocking events. To analyze wave activity and atmospheric circulation, we compute the quasi-geostrophic Eliassen–Palm (EP) flux and geostrophic winds. The results show that the observations agree with theory and previous studies in terms of the primary dynamic features and provide a detailed view of their vertical structure. We observe a clear positive peak of upward EP flux in the stratosphere prior to all SSW events. In seven out of eight events, this peak is preceded by a clear peak in the troposphere. Within the observed timeframe, we identify two types of downward dynamic interactions and the emergence of blocking events. During the 2007 and 2008 “reflecting” events, we observe a displacement of the polar vortex along with a downward propagation of wave activity from the stratosphere to the troposphere during vortex recovery, coinciding with the formation of blocking in the North Pacific region. Conversely, in the other six SSW “absorbing” events from 2009 to 2019, which were characterized by a vortex split, we observe wave absorption and the subsequent formation of blocking in the Euro-Atlantic region. The analysis of the static stability demonstrates an enhancement of the polar tropopause inversion layer as the result of SSWs, which was stronger for the absorbing events. Overall, our study provides an observational view of the synoptic and dynamic evolution of the major SSWs, their link to blocking, and the impact on the polar tropopause."

Herein, we coupled bio-orthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging with high-throughput fluorescence-activated single-cell sorting (FACS) and sequencing to characterize the phenome and genome of active ARB in complex environmental matrices. Active ARB, conferring resistance to six antibiotics throughout wastewater treatment, were distinguished and quantified. The percentage and concentration of active ARB ranged from 0.28% to 45.3% and from 1.1 × 104 to 2.09 × 107 cells/mL, respectively. Notably, the final effluents retained up to 4.79 × 104 cells/mL of active ARB. Targeted FACS and genomic sequencing revealed a distinct taxonomic composition of active ARB compared with that of the overall population. The coexistence of antibiotic resistome and mobilome in active ARB was also identified, including three high-quality metagenomic assembly genomes assigned to pathogenic bacteria, highlighting the substantial health risks due to their activity, phenotypic resistance, mobility, and pathogenicity. This study advances our understanding of previously overlooked active ARB in the environment by linking their resistance phenotype to their genotype. This high-throughput method will enable efficient quantitative surveillance of active AMR, providing valuable insights into risk control and management."

Bourke,Lithospheric Structure Above the Northern Appalachian Anomaly: Initial Results From the NEST Array,"Seismic tomography observations show a low‐velocity feature in the upper mantle beneath eastern North America known as the Northern Appalachian Anomaly (NAA). Proposed models for the formation of the NAA include a remnant high‐temperature feature resulting from the passage of the Great Meteor Hotspot, edge‐driven convection, and ongoing asthenospheric upwelling. We investigate the structure of the lithosphere above the central portion of the NAA using data from the New England Seismic Transects (NEST) experiment. Ps receiver functions reveal two consistent interfaces beneath the dense northern line of NEST: the Moho (the base of the crust) and a deeper negative velocity gradient (NVG) feature located at depths between 60 and 110 km. We consider several potential explanations for this NVG feature; based on comparisons with previous results, we propose that it likely corresponds to the lithosphere‐asthenosphere boundary. Our results indicate that the lithosphere beneath New England is nonuniform and has likely been thinned."
10.1029/2024GL110735,False,Geophysical Research Letters,这篇论文主要研究了不同水平网格间距下，大涡模拟（LES）和云解析模型（CRM）模拟的浅层和深层对流的掺入率。研究发现，随着分辨率的提高，估计的掺入率也随之增加，并且增长率与分辨率大致呈幂律关系。然而，除了浮力排序方案之外，所有常用的参数化方案都无法再现掺入率随分辨率单调增加的趋势，反而略有下降。对于这些方案，建议使用从 LES/CRM 模拟中推导出的幂律拟合公式作为高分辨率掺入率校正的缩放函数。初步测试表明，掺入率缩放的应用在很大程度上降低了气块浮力和对流有效位能，有利于减少高分辨率参数化对流。,"['convection', 'cloud resolving model', 'large eddy model', 'entrainment rate', 'grid spacing', 'parameterization']",Yaxin Zhao;Xiaocong Wang;Yimin Liu;Guoxiong Wu,Are Parameterized Entrainment Rates as Scale‐Dependent as Those Estimated From Cloud Resolving Model Simulations?,"Entrainment rates at varying horizontal grid spacing were diagnosed and analyzed based on Large Eddy Model (LES) and Cloud Resolving Model (CRM) simulations of shallow and deep convection. Results show the estimated entrainment rates increase with increasing resolution, and the growth rate is roughly power‐law related to resolution. However, all commonly used parameterizations except for the buoyancy sorting scheme fail to reproduce the monotonic increase of entrainment with resolution, but rather a slight decrease instead. For these schemes, it is suggested the power‐law fitting formula derived from LES/CRM simulations can be used as a scaling function for high‐resolution entrainment correction. Preliminary tests show that the application of entrainment scaling largely reduces the parcel buoyancy and thus the convective available potential energy, favoring the reduction of parameterized convection at high resolution."

Substantial plasma lifting is observed within the initial Storm Enhanced Density plume with ionospheric peak heights increasing by 150–300 km, reaching levels of up to 630 km. Scintillation is observed within the cusp during the initial expansion phase of the storm, spreading across the auroral oval thereafter. Patch transport into the polar cap produces broad regions of scintillation that are rapidly cleared from the region after a strong Interplanetary Magnetic Field reversal at 2230UT. Strong heating and composition changes result in the complete absence of the F2‐layer on the eleventh, suffocating high latitude convection from dense plasma necessary for Tongue of Ionization and patch formation, ultimately resulting in a suppression of polar cap scintillation on the eleventh."

The resulting persisting sea surface depression can easily be monitored using the present‐day altimeter constellation. Following a semi‐empirical framework, these baroclinic wake signatures are linked to the inner core TC dynamic and the ocean stratification. To collect these fine‐scale parameters, spaceborne SAR instruments and Argo fleet are used, to precisely capture the maximum wind region and the irregularities of the ocean vertical structure. This combination of high‐resolution information is found paramount to fully capture the modulation of sea surface height anomalies, and its mean trend, especially for major hurricanes. Baroclinic signatures mostly range around 10–20 cm and peak at 40 cm. Deeper anomalies correspond to barotropic response, removed from the present analysis."

However, for the greening of existing forests, the role of human interventions is unclear. Here we paired neighboring natural and planted forests in Southern China to minimize the differences between the forest types and analyzed the vegetation index EVI2 from Landsat over 1987 to 2021. The EVI2 trends observed in natural forests can be seen as mainly responses to large‐scale environmental changes, whereas the difference between the forest types represents the impact caused by human interventions. We found that though the mean EVI2 of planted forests was comparable to that of natural forests, the greening trends were overall 7.0% lower in planted forests. Our results suggest that human interventions associated with planted forests did not accelerate their greening, indicating the necessity for refined policies to enhance future forest greening."

The retrieval algorithm is developed based on an observed regression relationship between satellite‐based OLCI‐estimated transmittance and ground‐based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)‐estimated IWV in the temporal domain. The results show that all newly retrieved IWV estimates have an overall good consistency with ground‐based IWV from additional GNSS‐sensed measurements, indicating the feasibility of the retrieval approach.

This new research indicates the importance of coordinated system‐scale barrier island management, as strategies to reduce coastal hazard risk in one location will directly affect adjacent communities. Further, this work demonstrates that reducing barrier management interventions may actually promote barrier recovery and sustainability in the face of sea level rise. In addition, recent advances in the analysis and application of remotely sensed data from satellites and oblique aerial photography provide scientists an unprecedented opportunity to track coastal evolution over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales at minimal cost. As sea level rise and changing storm patterns challenge the sustainable management of barrier island systems, integrating these advanced, transdisciplinary tools will enable scientists and coastal practitioners to more thoroughly evaluate coastal adaptation options, efficiently invest limited resources to mitigate coastal hazard risk for communities, support healthy ecosystems, and reduce system‐wide impacts."

This approach is based on climate change conditions and it accurately simulates future land use changes and crop growth processes, establishes a carbon emission intensity optimization model, and generates a spatial planting structure optimization and regulation scheme based on intelligent optimization algorithms under changing scenarios. The results of the model application show that the planting structure option in the future scenario can increase economic benefit by up to 14.8% compared to the current scenario while simultaneously reducing total greenhouse gas emissions by 6.77%. Correlation analysis of planting area, irrigation water volume, carbon intensity value and unilateral water use efficiency can be used to obtain the coordination level of each county under different regulation scenarios. This “simulation–optimization” modeling approach provides an effective approach to achieve synergistic and coordinated development of regional agricultural benefits and carbon reduction by fine‐tuning the planting structure, which promotes low‐carbon and high‐quality development of regional agriculture."

We analyzed dengue incidence trends and the relationship between annual mean minimum temperatures (AMMTs) and dengue incidence rates from 1990 to 2019 in 122 countries using the Global Burden of Disease and TerraClimate data sets. We also projected global dengue incidence rates under different carbon emission scenarios using temperature data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) data set. Our results reveal a significant increase in global dengue cases from 1990 to 2019 and a positive correlation between temperature and dengue incidence. The association between AMMT and dengue incidence strengthened at temperatures exceeding 21°C. Central and eastern sub‐Saharan Africa, as well as Oceania, were identified as the regions most sensitive to dengue; males and individuals aged 15–19 or 70–84 years were the most susceptible to dengue under rising temperatures. Our projections suggest that global dengue incidence will substantially increase by 2050 and 2100. By 2100, regions including Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, the southern United States, southern China, and island countries in the Pacific and Indian Oceans are projected to become year‐round dengue‐endemic under a high‐emission climate scenario. Our findings underscore the importance of implementing effective measures to mitigate the impact of climate change on dengue transmission. Identifying high‐risk areas and susceptible populations, along with understanding the projected expansion of dengue‐endemic regions, will provide valuable guidance for targeted interventions to address this growing global health challenge in the face of changing climatic conditions."

 Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) can be associated with neurological deficits and has profound consequences for mortality and morbidity. Cerebral vasospasm (CVS) and delayed cerebral ischemia affect neurological outcomes in SAH patients, but their mechanisms are not fully understood, and effective treatments are limited. Here, we report that urotensin II receptor UT plays a pivotal role in both early events and delayed mechanisms following SAH in male mice. Few days post-SAH, UT expression is triggered by blood or hemoglobin in the leptomeningeal compartment. UT contributes to perimeningeal glia limitans astrocyte reactivity, microvascular alterations and neuroinflammation independent of CNS-associated macrophages (CAMs). Later, CAM-dependent vascular inflammation and subsequent CVS develop, leading to cognitive dysfunction. In an SAH model using humanized UTh+/h+ male mice, we show that post-SAH CVS and behavioral deficits, mediated by UT through Gq/PLC/Ca2+ signaling, are prevented by UT antagonists. These results highlight the potential of targeting UT pathways to reduce early meningeal response and delayed cerebral ischemia in SAH patients. “In subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), therapies are limited and clinical outcomes remain disappointing.

 Human economic activities drive the production and consumption of goods and services, contribute to the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, the extent of economic growth’s influence on the SDGs remains unclear. To fill this knowledge gap, here, we quantified the environmental effects of economic activities and explored correlations between environmental effect and achieving SDGs. We developed six Environmental Footprint Indices, with a higher score indicating better efficiency or lower burden. Here we show that the various Environmental Footprint Indices had synergistic and trade-off effects on most SDG targets indices, but the synergistic effects prevailed. As income increased, the correlation between Environmental Footprint Indices and SDG target indices gradually strengthened. improved production efficiency and consumption changes notably advance SDGs, especially in low-income group countries. Our work provides scientific insights into the impact and prospects of environmental regulation required for achieving the SDGs by 2030.

 All-insulator heterostructures with an emerging metallicity are at the forefront of material science, which typically contain at least one band insulator while it is not necessary to be. Here we show emergent phenomena in a series of all-correlated-insulator heterostructures that composed of insulating CaIrO3 and insulating La0.67Sr0.33MnO3. We observed an intriguing insulator-to-metal transition, that depends delicately on the thickness of the iridate component. The simultaneous enhancements of magnetization, electric conductivity, and magnetoresistance effect indicate a percolation-type nature of the insulator-to-metal transition, with the percolation threshold can be reached at an exceptionally low volume fraction of the iridate. Such a drastic transition is induced by an interfacial charge transfer, which interestingly alters the electronic and crystalline structures of the bulk region rather than the limited ultrathin interface. We further showcased the central role of effective correlation in modulating the insulator-to-metal transition, by demonstrating that the critical thickness of iridate for triggering the metallic state can be systematically reduced down to a single unit-cell layer.

Here the authors show that, in fibroblasts, ASPP1 promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of p53, decreasing myofibroblast activity and improving cardiac fibrosis and function after myocardial infarction. 
 In the healing process of myocardial infarction, cardiac fibroblasts are activated to produce collagen, leading to adverse remodeling and heart failure. Our previous study showed that ASPP1 promotes cardiomyocyte apoptosis by enhancing the nuclear trafficking of p53. We thus explored the influence of ASPP1 on myocardial fibrosis and the underlying mechanisms. Here, we observed that ASPP1 was increased after 4 weeks of MI. Both global and myofibroblast knockout of ASPP1 in mice mitigated cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis after MI. Strikingly, ASPP1 produced the opposite influence on p53 level and cell fate in cardiac fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes. Knockdown of ASPP1 increased p53 levels and inhibited the activity of cardiac fibroblasts. ASPP1 accumulated in the cytoplasm of fibroblasts while the level of p53 was reduced following TGF-β1 stimulation; however, inhibition of ASPP1 increased the p53 level and promoted p53 nuclear translocation. Mechanistically, ASPP1 is directly bound to deubiquitinase OTUB1, thereby promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of p53, attenuating myofibroblast activity and cardiac fibrosis, and improving heart function after MI.

 Excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) and dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota are pivotal symptoms for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and its associated complications, such as intestinal fibrosis. This research introduces a probiotic inulin hydrogel loaded with polypyrrole (PPy) nanozymes and antifibrotic drug pirfenidone (PFD) (PPy/PFD@Inulin gel) designed for the concurrent amelioration of IBD and its fibrotic complication. Upon oral administration, the inulin gel matrix could extend the gastrointestinal residence time of PPy nanozymes and PFD, facilitating the efficient reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and enhancement of the intestinal epithelial barrier repair as well as the suppression of intestinal fibrosis through sustained RONS scavenging, modulation of gut microbiota and attenuation of the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway to inhibit fibroblast proliferation. Notably, the PPy/PFD@Inulin gel demonstrated significant prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in acute and chronic colitis as well as intestinal fibrosis induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in mouse models.

 Neuronal hyperexcitability is a key element of many neurodegenerative disorders including the motor neuron disease Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), where it occurs associated with elevated late sodium current (INaL). INaL results from incomplete inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) after their opening and shapes physiological membrane excitability. However, dysfunctional increases can cause hyperexcitability-associated diseases. Here we reveal the atypical binding mechanism which explains how the neuroprotective ALS-treatment drug riluzole stabilises VGSCs in their inactivated state to cause the suppression of INaL that leads to reversed cellular overexcitability. Riluzole accumulates in the membrane and enters VGSCs through openings to their membrane-accessible fenestrations. Riluzole binds within these fenestrations to stabilise the inactivated channel state, allowing for the selective allosteric inhibition of INaL without the physical block of Na+ conduction associated with traditional channel pore binding VGSC drugs. We further demonstrate that riluzole can reproduce these effects on a disease variant of the non-neuronal VGSC isoform Nav1.4, where pathologically increased INaL is caused directly by mutation. Overall, we identify a model for VGSC inhibition that produces effects consistent with the inhibitory action of riluzole observed in models of ALS. Our findings will aid future drug design and supports research directed towards riluzole repurposing. The authors here present a high-resolution structure of riluzole bound to a voltage-gated sodium channel.

 There is debate about the use of wetlands as natural climate solutions due to their ability to act as a “double-edged sword” with respect to climate impacts by both sequestering CO2 while emitting CH4. Here, we used a process-based greenhouse gas (GHG) perturbation model to simulate wetland radiative forcing and temperature change associated with wetland state conversion over 500 years based on empirical carbon flux measurements, and CO2-equivalent (CO2-e.q.) metrics to assess the net flux of GHGs from wetlands on a comparable basis. Three CO2-e.q. metrics were used to describe the relative radiative impact of CO2 and CH4—the conventional global warming potential (GWP) that looks at pulse GHG emissions over a fixed timeframe, the sustained-flux GWP (SGWP) that looks at sustained GHG emissions over a fixed timeframe, and GWP* that explicitly accounts for changes in the radiative forcing of CH4 over time (initially more potent but then diminishing after about a decade)—against model-derived mean temperature profiles. GWP* most closely estimated the mean temperature profiles associated with net wetland GHG emissions. Using the GWP*, intact wetlands serve as net CO2-e.q. carbon sinks and deliver net cooling effects on the climate. Prioritizing the conservation of intact wetlands is a cost-effective approach with immediate climate benefits that align with the Paris Agreement and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change timeline of net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. Restoration of wetlands also has immediate climate benefits (reduced warming), but with the majority of climate benefits (cooling) occurring over longer timescales, making it an effective short and long-term natural climate solution with additional co-benefits."

 Nitrous oxide is a potent greenhouse gas. Anthropogenically enhanced nitrogen deposition causes natural forest soils to release more nitrous oxide, exacerbating global warming. We used data from nitrogen addition experiments conducted in forests worldwide to quantify the spatially varying sensitivity of soil nitrous oxide emission to nitrogen deposition, thereby inferring soil nitrous oxide emission dynamics from nitrogen deposition data. From 1985 to 2015, nitrous oxide emitted from global forest soils increased from 3.55 to 3.85 teragrams of nitrogen per year. Nitrogen deposition contributed directly to 9.0% of global forest soil nitrous oxide emissions. The derived country-specific sensitivities of soil nitrous oxide emission to nitrogen deposition could be employed as localized emission factors for forestland nitrous oxide emission inventories. This study sheds light on a process-augmented data-driven approach to estimating global nitrous oxide emissions by synthesizing experimental and observational data.

 Aquaculture is a major emission source of atmospheric methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). However, its contribution remains highly uncertain because the source has been neglected in global and national greenhouse gas inventories. Here, we present an inventory of CH4 and N2O fluxes from five freshwater aquaculture systems in China, which accounted for more than half of global freshwater aquaculture production during 2000-2020. We show that total CH4 and N2O emissions were 2.5 (0.6-4.2) Tg CH4 yr-1 and 18.3 (3.8-32.2) Gg N2O yr-1, respectively, with 75% coming from ponds and paddy fields. CH4 and N2O effluxes from freshwater aquaculture were 5 and 2 times higher than the average from other inland water bodies, respectively. Aquaculture accounts for half of the national inland water emissions, and outweighs the land soil methane sink. We suggest that tracking aquacultural emissions and their reduction through aerated systems could provide additional opportunity to reduce agricultural non-CO2 emissions without compromising food security.

 Stressors endanger lake ecosystem biodiversity and networks, especially in sandy lakes of arid/semiarid regions, where impacts are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the changes in multitrophic biodiversity and ecological networks under increasing stress (temperature, nutrients, lake area) by using sedimentary DNA from a shrinking sandy lake in China over nearly 100 years. With increasing stress, species richness and stability increased, whereas species turnover decreased. Species synchronism decreased at high-trophic levels but increased at low-trophic levels. Empirical dynamic modeling showed network connectance and strength of species interactions decreased–increased–decreased over time, signaling a potential adaption–resistance–degradation change in ecosystem responses with increasing stress. Models also indicated network structure primarily depended on direct effects of nutrients and temperature under low/medium stress and on a diversity-mediated pathway under high stress. Thus, maintaining ecological network structure complexity and integrity in lake ecosystems is essential to mitigate the effects of multiple stresses.

 Tropical cyclone-induced storm surge is a major coastal risk, which will be further amplified by rising sea levels under global warming. Here, we present a computational efficient, globally applicable modeling approach in which ocean surge and coastal inundation dynamics are modeled in a single step by the open-source solver GeoClaw. We compare our approach to two state-of-the-art, globally applicable approaches: (i) using a static inundation model to translate coastal water level time series from a full-scale physical ocean dynamics into inundated areas, and (ii) a fully static approach directly mapping wind fields to inundation areas. For a global set of 71 storms, we compare the modeled flooded areas to satellite-based floodplain observations. We find that, overall, the models have only moderate skill in reproducing the observed floodplains. GeoClaw performs better than the two other modeling approaches that lack a process-based representation of inundation dynamics. The computational efficiency of the presented approach opens up new perspectives for global assessments of coastal risks from tropical cyclones.

 Pine Wilt Disease (PWD) is a forest infectious disease that inflicts substantial economic losses to China’s forestry. Its rapid spread and the significant challenges associated with its control make early detection of infected trees crucial for disaster prevention. Unmanned aerial systems (UASs) hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technologies provide high-resolution spectral diagnostic information coupled with intricate three-dimensional structural data, which has potential for fine grained monitoring of PWD. However, how to fuse HSI and LiDAR data to identify the early infected individual trees is still a challenge. This study presents a novel instance segmentation network, BH3DNet, to identify individual trees at different PWD-infected stages by extracting high-level abstract features based on the fusion of drone HSI and LiDAR data. BH3DNet introduces the PointNet++ model as the base network, and incorporates a shared encoder and twin parallel decoders to align semantic category prediction and instance segmentation of individual trees in an end-to-end approach. By applying an enhanced point cloud dataset that fuses drone HSI and LiDAR point cloud data, this model facilitates the identification of PWD infection stages at the individual tree scale. We evaluated the proposed model in a Masson pine forest stand sparsely mixed with broadleaf trees in a variety of infection states ranging from healthy to severely infected by PWD, and compared the performance of the model using the RGB bands, full HSI bands and screened bands as inputs, respectively. BH3DNet achieves an overall accuracy of 89.65 % with a Kappa × 100 of 87.29 for identifying individual trees using screened HSI bands and LiDAR point cloud, significantly outperforming the Mask R-CNN using only HSI data (overall accuracy: 70.81 %, Kappa × 100: 64.16).

Pihl Karlsson;P.E. Karlsson;S. Hellsten;H. Danielsson;V. Kronnäs;C. Akselsson,Total deposition of sulphur to coniferous forests in Sweden - Taking canopy exchange into account,"•Dry deposition of S to coniferous forests was estimated with surrogate surfaces and wet deposition of S was estimated from bulk deposition. •The deposition of S that was measured in throughfall was lower than the estimated total dry and wet deposition of S. •The canopy uptake of S to coniferous forests in Sweden was estimated to 0.1-0.8 kg S ha−1yr−1and was highest during summer. 
 In the low deposition situation of today at many of the long-term Swedish forest monitoring sites, the deposition measured as precipitation to the open field, i.e. bulk deposition of oxidized sulphur (S) is often higher or equal to deposition of S sampled under the forest canopies, i.e. as throughfall. This suggests that the total S deposition estimated using throughfall is underestimated. The reason for this is direct exchange of S with the forest canopies, leading to an underestimation which becomes evident in low-deposition areas. We describe a new method to estimate the dry deposition of S to coniferous forest based on measurements with Teflon string samplers as surrogate surfaces, in combination with measurements of the net throughfall for sodium (throughfall subtracted with wet deposition). The wet deposition was estimated from bulk deposition measurements on the open field, corrected for dry deposition to the collectors. The method was applied for Norway spruce forests at monitoring sites across Sweden during nine years 2014–2022, and total deposition was calculated based on wet deposition and the estimated dry deposition. The estimated annual total deposition of S as a mean value for coniferous forests ranged between 0.8 and 5.2 kg S ha−1 yr−1 with lowest values in northern Sweden and highest in southwest Sweden. The share of dry deposition of the total S deposition was between 20 and 53%. The mean annual deposition of S measured as throughfall during 2014–2022 for three different regions in Sweden was between 16 and 41% lower compared to the corresponding total deposition estimated with the new method. The canopy exchange of S was analyzed on a monthly basis as the difference between the estimated total deposition and the measured throughfall deposition of S. At most sites, there was a canopy uptake of S during the summer months and a leakage of S during the winter months. This indicates that the canopy exchange of S is a phenomenon that involves some biological activity."

 Cloud chemistry is of paramount importance in the secondary production of atmospheric aerosols, influencing the spatial-temporal distribution of gases and aerosols in the atmosphere. Using WRF/CUACE (China Meteorological Administration Unified Atmospheric Chemistry Environment), this study assesses the seasonal impacts of cloud chemistry on the concentrations of SO2, sulfate, as well as two oxidizers, H2O2 and O3, in the most east-central areas of China, including four key pollution zones (the North China Plain (NCP), the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), the Pearl River Delta (PRD), and the Sichuan Basin (SCB)). Near the surface, H2O2-oxidation was the dominant pathway for cloud chemistry in four key pollution zones in four seasons. H2O2 consumption is most pronounced in summer, especially in the SCB and NCP, while O3 consumption peaks in autumn, particularly in the PRD and southeastern coastal areas. While at higher altitudes, oxidation by O3 and H2O2 is compatible with the cloud chemistry process. Near the surface, cloud chemistry consumes SO2 ranging from approximately 0.1 ppb–5.0 ppb, resulting in the generation of about 6.0–25.0 μg m−3 of sulfate. Higher SO2 reduction and sulfate increase are in both summer and winter, especially for the SCB and NCP in summer, and the SCB in winter. Vertically, the cloud chemistry process primarily concentrates its influence on SO2 and sulfate concentrations below 5 km, particularly within the turbulent zone of the troposphere below 2 km in all the four pollution zones and four seasons. The most notable seasonal variation occurs in the NCP compared to other zones. This study also shows that cloud chemistry effectively improves the seasonal simulation accuracy of SO2 and sulfate, resulting in improved correlation and a notable reduction in RMSE."

 Over the past few years, peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) has drawn significant attention as a key indicator of photochemical pollution owing to its intimate relationship with ozone and associated health effects. This study presents measurements conducted at the Korea University campus in Seoul during the high-ozone seasons from 2018 to 2021. PAN concentration was measured using fast gas chromatography with luminol chemiluminescence detection (GC-LCD), alongside measurements of O3, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), NO, NO2, and meteorological variables, including boundary layer height (BLH).The mean concentrations of PAN and O3 over the years were 0.56 ppbv and 35 ppbv in 2018, 1.29 ppbv and 58 ppbv in 2019, 0.21 ppbv and 50 ppbv 2020, and 0.53 ppbv and 46 ppbv in 2021, respectively. The annual variation observed in Seoul is consistent with trends seen in major cities worldwide during the COVID19 pandemic, reflecting a substantial reduction in urban emissions. Notably, the mean concentration of NOx and VOCs decreased significantly by more than 50 % and 25%, respectively, from 2019 to 2021.At temperatures above 30 °C, PAN decomposition was accelerated, decoupling a consistent positive relationship between PAN and O3 in 2020 and 2021. The results of a 0-D photochemical model (F0AM) calculation demonstrated that PAN formation primarily stems from anthropogenic VOCs, particularly > C2 alkenes. Elevated PAN concentrations during nighttime were attributed to boundary layer expansion and upper-air entrainment. Instances where PAN concentrations surged to at least 3 ppbv or higher in 2019 were attributed to biomass burning impacted air, as evidenced by concurrent elevations in K+ and OC in PM2.5, and O3.This study underscores the complex interplay of factors influencing PAN and ozone enhancements under decreased precursor levels, with an emphasis on dynamic change in the boundary layer, and long-distance transport of non-fossil sources during agricultural burning seasons."
