10.1088/1748-9326/ad6a73,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要关注的是加州索尔顿海地区的地下水资源问题，探讨了地热能开发和锂提取对该地区水资源的影响。论文分析了地热能开发和锂提取对水资源的需求量，并与该地区从科罗拉多河获得的水资源配额进行了比较。论文还提到了未来水资源配额可能减少对该地区水资源的影响。总体而言，这篇论文主要关注的是水资源管理和水污染问题，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。,[],Margaret M Busse;Michael A McKibben;William Stringfellow;Patrick Dobson;Jennifer R Stokes-Draut,Impact of geothermal expansion and lithium extraction in the Salton Sea known geothermal resource area (SS-KGRA) on local water resources,Saline brines currently being brought to the surface to produce geothermal energy in the Salton Sea region of California contain high concentrations of lithium that could potentially be extracted before the brine is reinjected back into the geothermal reservoir. This would create a new supply chain of domestically sourced lithium for the United States to produce lithium-based batteries that will help drive the transition to a renewable-based energy grid. Plans to expand geothermal production along with lithium extraction are being considered in the Salton Sea known geothermal resource area. We discuss water availability and quality issues and potential concerns about water pollution associated with this geothermal expansion and lithium production in the context of potential future restrictions on water extractions from the Colorado River Basin. We estimate that water demand for currently proposed geothermal production and lithium extraction facilities only accounts for ∼4% of the historical water supply in the region. Regional water allocation will be more impacted by the proposed cuts to the region’s water allocation from the Colorado River between now and 2050 than by expansion of geothermal production with associated lithium extraction. Accurately planning for water needs in the future will require more specific information about water demands of the lithium extraction and refining processes.
10.1088/1748-9326/ad6ea3,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要关注的是森林管理和碳循环之间的关系，以及如何将动态森林收获模型融入全球多部门模型中。文章重点在于分析森林管理决策对森林碳储量的影响，以及经济因素和碳价值对森林管理的影响。论文并没有涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,[],Kanishka B Narayan;Pralit Patel;Marshall Wise;Abigail Snyder;Kate Calvin;Neal Graham,Seeing the forest for the trees: implementing dynamic representation of forest management and forest carbon in a long-term global multisector model,"Studies have found that understanding forest management is critical in understanding the interaction between the carbon cycle and the integrated human-Earth system. This makes effectively representing forest management decisions such as planting and harvesting important. Here, we implement a novel dynamic forest harvest model in a global state of the art multi-sector dynamics model, namely the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM). We implement an approach that explicitly tracks forest age and generates rotation ages for forest harvest that are responsive to changes in wood prices, changes in forest age and regional preferences for forest rotation. Furthermore, the forest sector in GCAM competes for investment with other land use types in the future years based on expected profit. Our baseline scenario results indicate that with the new forest harvest model, the current global wood product demand in GCAM can be met with minimal loss of old growth forest through the age-based harvest decisions. We find that economic pressure for deforestation and consequent loss of forest carbon is a bigger driver of global forest change than wood harvests, especially in developing regions. Under alternative scenarios where an economic value is placed on carbon across the terrestrial and energy systems, while there is an increase in forest plantations, there can be corresponding decreases in forest cover in some regions as forest land competes with land for bio-energy crops. When the carbon in forests is assigned a price, we find that the average rotation age for wood harvests can be reduced across regions to harvest forests in a more carbon efficient manner."

A sub-category of the literature studying groundwater-energy nexus tends to focus on groundwater depletion hotspots where entrenched interests and long-standing histories restrict the range of feasible energy pricing options. Using an agent-based model, we estimate the expected impact of expanding groundwater irrigation under five different energy provision models in Odisha, an Indian state with among the lowest irrigation coverage, and, therefore, is free of path-dependent policies. We find that aquifer properties play a crucial role in mediating the groundwater-energy nexus. In this study region, on average, the maximum volume of water that can be pumped from a well of a specific depth in an alluvial aquifer is approximately 150 times the volume that can be pumped from a well in a hard-rock aquifer. Therefore, the risk of over-consumption and aquifer depletion is a far greater challenge in alluvial than hard-rock aquifers. Risks of groundwater consumption and depletion can be limited in hard-rock aquifers provided the number and depths of wells can be controlled. Capital subsidies for well construction could be an effective policy to increase irrigated areas as long as economic incentives for digging deeper are not distorted. Our results imply that solar pumps are a relatively safe option for hard-rock regions where deep drawdowns naturally limit the extent of over-extraction. Solar pumps are also estimated to be among the most economical for expanding irrigation. Using a novel data set comprising biophysical and socioeconomic data, we find hard-rock regions to have limited irrigation coverage, high availability of annually replenishable groundwater, and high concentrations of marginalized farmers. Therefore, groundwater irrigation expansion in hard-rock areas could have dual benefits of ensuring future food security and targeting poverty reduction."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad71e0,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要关注碳捕获与封存 (CDR) 技术的研究趋势，通过文献计量分析方法，研究了 2012 年至 2023 年间 CDR 相关研究的地理分布、技术领域和资金来源。论文分析了不同 CDR 技术的研究热点，例如生物炭、植树造林/再造林、土壤碳封存、直接空气捕获与封存、生物能源捕获与封存以及蓝碳。虽然论文涉及大气中的二氧化碳，但主要关注的是如何从大气中去除二氧化碳，而不是通过遥感技术监测大气成分。因此，这篇论文与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。,"['carbon dioxide removal (CDR)', 'biochar', 'afforestation/reforestation', 'soil carbon sequestration', 'direct air carbon capture and storage', 'bioenergy carbon capture and storage', 'blue carbon']",Romain Presty;Olivier Massol;Emma Jagu;Pascal da Costa,Mapping the landscape of carbon dioxide removal research: a bibliometric analysis,"An intense global research effort on carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies is generating a rapidly expanding scientific literature. These contributions stem from various disciplines and investigate various CDR concepts and their potential implications. This study conducts an updated analysis of the international research effort on CDR from 2012 to 2023, examining 7893 publications using bibliometric techniques. We focus on the geographic distribution of technology-specific research and the funding driving this research. Significant publication growth is observed post-2015, particularly after 2018 and in 2023, driven primarily by the EU, China, and the US. Notably, biochar, afforestation/reforestation, and soil carbon sequestration are among the most researched CDR options, with direct air carbon capture and storage, bioenergy carbon capture and storage, and blue carbon also receiving substantial attention, especially in 2023. Analysis of scientific funding patterns aligns with these trends. Based on these findings, the study proposes a knowledge roadmap to elucidate emerging trends in CDR literature, offering insights for future research and policy development."

Farm-level management strategies play a critical role in mitigating the impacts of and consequences for farmer livelihoods and food security. While the impacts of extreme weather on crop yields are well documented in recent studies, these predominantly focused on expansive geographical scales and commonly overlooked the critical role of management practices in modulating the dynamics of weather-crop sensitivities. We fill this gap in the literature by using a unique dataset that explores the timely relationship between extreme weather and crop yields at farm level in the Netherlands. We cover 10 types of crops and elucidate the role of soil types, irrigation and nutrient application in modulating the relationship between extreme weather and crops, by estimating fixed-effects regression models. We show substantial impacts from drought during the growing- and harvesting period and excessive precipitation during the planting- and growing period. Severe droughts show significant ( ) reductions in yield for all crops, and lead to yield reductions up to 24 percent relative to average yields during the growing period. Meanwhile, eight crops show significant reductions in yield due to severe water excess during the planting period, with yield reductions up to 18 percent. Soils such as sand or loess amplify the negative impact of drought on crop yield, while softening the impact of excessive precipitation. Irrigation and to a lesser extent nutrient application are shown to moderately decrease the impact of extreme weather on crop yield. Our findings contribute valuable insights to guide local adaptation priorities which are critical given the projected increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather under climate change."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad751f,True,Environmental Research Letters,该研究使用最新耦合模式比较计划第六阶段（CMIP6）的模型，分析了全球变暖下哈德利环流（HC）的变化，特别关注了模型对HC减弱和扩展的预测差异。研究发现，模型对HC变化的预测差异主要源于对平衡气候敏感性（ECS）的不确定性。通过使用ECS的最佳估计值（3 K）来约束HC的预测，研究发现，在SSP5-8.5情景下，约束后的预测结果显示，与多模型平均值相比，北半球（南半球）HC减弱（极地移动）幅度减少了15%（11%）。相应的预测不确定性分别降低了约77.4%和75.6%。研究结果表明，随着CO2浓度的增加，HC的变化幅度小于预期。,"['Hadley circulation', 'climate models', 'global warming', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric composition', 'CO2 concentrations']",Mingna Wu;Chao Li;Zhongshi Zhang,Recalibrated projections of the Hadley circulation under global warming,"Climate models project a weakening and expansion of the Hadley circulation (HC) under global warming but with considerable spread in the magnitude of these changes. Here, utilizing models from the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), we illustrate how the variance in projected changes in the HC arises from equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) uncertainty across models. Models with higher ECS project a greater extent of static stability increase hence larger HC changes. Using the best estimate of ECS with value of 3 K (∼2.5–4.0 K) to constrain the HC projection, we reveal that the constrained projection yields a 15% (11%) decrease in the weakening (poleward shift) of the HC in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere compared to the multimodel mean under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. The corresponding projection uncertainty is reduced by about 77.4% and 75.6%, respectively. Our results indicate a smaller-than-expected change in the HC in response to increased CO2 concentrations."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad7520,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要关注的是土壤水分和蒸汽压亏缺对热带植被生产力的影响，并利用信息论方法分析了它们之间的因果关系。研究发现，过去蒸汽压亏缺通过影响土壤水分，进而影响了热带地区的植被生产力。论文没有涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['soil moisture', 'vapor pressure deficit', 'gross primary productivity', 'tropical vegetation']",Akash Verma;Subimal Ghosh,Unveiling the role of past vapor pressure deficit through soil moisture in driving tropical vegetation productivity,"The impact of soil moisture (SM) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) on gross primary productivity (GPP) variability in ecosystems is a topic of significant interest. Previous studies have predominantly focused on real-time associations between SM, VPD, and carbon uptake, attributing SM as the principal driver of GPP variability due to its direct and indirect effects through VPD. Using an information theory-based process network approach, we discovered that the influence of past VPD, mediated through its effects on SM, emerges as the primary driver of GPP variability across tropical regions. The past VPD conditions influence GPP directly and also affect SM in real-time alongside GPP, which subsequently impacts GPP variability. Examining land-atmosphere feedback using information theory reveals that past VPD conditions influence SM, but not the reverse. These causal structures explain the consistent decline in GPP with increasing VPD trends observed in tropical regions, which are not consistent with SM trends. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering the influence of past VPD mediated by SM when analyzing complex land-vegetation-atmosphere interactions."

The high-alkalinity seawater would be generated using bipolar membrane electrodialysis technology to remove acid and the alkaline stream returned to the sea. Response of the receiving waters was evaluated using a shoreline resolving hydrodynamic model with biogeochemistry, and carbonate chemistry. Two sites, and two deployment scales, each with enhanced TA of 2997 mmol m−3 and a pH of 9 were simulated. The effects on air-sea CO2 flux and pH in the near-field as well as over the larger estuary wide domain were assessed. The large-scale deployment (addition of 164 Mmoles TA yr−1) in a small embayment (Sequim Bay, 12.5 km2) resulted in removal of 2066 T of CO2 (45% of total simulated) at rate of 3756 mmol m−2 yr−1, higher than the 63 mmol m−2 yr−1 required globally to remove 1.0 GT CO2 yr−1. It also reduced acidity in the bay, ΔpH ≈ +0.1 pH units, an amount comparable to the historic impacts of anthropogenic acidification in the Salish Sea. The mixing and dilution of added TA with distance from the source results in reduced CDR rates such that comparable amount 2176 T CO2 yr−1 was removed over >1000 fold larger area of the rest of the model domain. There is the potential for more removal occurring beyond the region modeled. The CDR from reduction of outgassing between October and May accounts for as much as 90% of total CDR simulated. Of the total, only 375 T CO2 yr−1 (8%) was from the open shelf portion of the model domain. With shallow depths limiting vertical mixing, nearshore estuarine waters may provide a more rapid removal of CO2 using alkalinity enhancement relative to deeper oceanic sites."
10.5194/acp-24-9843-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了美国西南部沙漠地区尘埃对气候的直接辐射效应。研究人员利用三年来的实地观测数据和机载可见光/红外成像光谱仪（AVIRIS）获取的土壤矿物学数据，通过模型模拟和实地观测相结合的方法，对尘埃的直接辐射效应进行了量化。研究结果表明，该地区尘埃对气候有轻微的冷却效应。论文涉及到大气环境遥感技术，包括利用卫星观测和机载光谱仪获取数据，分析大气成分（尘埃）对辐射的影响，以及对气候变化的影响。,"['dust', 'aerosols', 'radiative effect', 'airborne spectrometer', 'AVIRIS', 'satellite observations', 'remote sensing', 'climate', 'weather', 'atmospheric composition']",Alexandra Kuwano;Amato T. Evan;Blake Walkowiak;Robert Frouin,Quantifying the dust direct radiative effect in the southwestern United States: findings from multiyear measurements,"The dust direct radiative effect is highly uncertain. Here we used new measurements collected over 3 years and during dust storms at a field site in a desert region in the southwestern United States to estimate the regional dust direct radiative effect. We also used novel soil mineralogy retrieved from an airborne spectrometer to estimate this parameter with model output. We find that, in this region, dust has a minimal net cooling effect on this region's climate. 
 Mineral aerosols (i.e., dust) can affect climate and weather by absorbing and scattering shortwave and longwave radiation in the Earth's atmosphere, the direct radiative effect. Yet understanding of the direct effect is so poor that the sign of the net direct effect at top of the atmosphere (TOA) is unconstrained, and thus it is unknown if dust cools or warms Earth's climate. Here we develop methods to estimate the instantaneous shortwave direct effect via observations of aerosols and radiation made over a 3-year period in a desert region of the southwestern US, obtaining a direct effect of -14±1 and -9±6 W m−2 at the surface and TOA, respectively. We also generate region-specific dust optical properties via a novel dataset of soil mineralogy from the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), which are then used to model the dust direct radiative effect in the shortwave and longwave. Using this modeling method, we obtain an instantaneous shortwave direct effect of -21±7 and -1±7 W m−2. The discrepancy between the model and observational direct effect is due to stronger absorption in the model, which we interpret as an AVIRIS soil iron oxide content that is too large. Combining the shortwave observational direct effect with a modeled longwave TOA direct effect of 1±1 W m−2, we obtain an instantaneous TOA net effect of -8±6 W m−2, implying a cooling effect of dust. These findings provide a useful constraint on the dust direct effect in the southwestern United States."
10.5194/acp-24-9885-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了新冠肺炎疫情期间大气氨气浓度升高对颗粒物pH值和亚硝酸（HONO）生成的影响。研究发现，疫情期间，由于硫酸盐和硝酸盐浓度显著下降，导致铵盐转化为氨气，进而导致颗粒物pH值上升。研究表明，颗粒物pH值的升高促进了HONO的生成，这可能与NO2和SO2之间的氧化还原反应有关。研究结果强调了协调控制SO2、NOx和NH3排放的重要性，以避免颗粒物pH值快速上升，并控制HONO的生成。,"['atmospheric composition', 'air quality monitoring', 'satellite observations', 'HONO', 'NH3', 'particle pH', 'NOx', 'SO2']",Xinyuan Zhang;Lingling Wang;Nan Wang;Shuangliang Ma;Shenbo Wang;Ruiqin Zhang;Dong Zhang;Mingkai Wang;Hongyu Zhang,Measurement report: Elevated atmospheric ammonia may promote particle pH and HONO formation – insights from the COVID-19 pandemic,"This study highlights the importance of the redox reaction of NO2 with SO2 based on actual atmospheric observations. The particle pH in future China is expected to rise steadily. Consequently, this reaction could become a significant source of HONO in China. Therefore, it is crucial to coordinate the control of SO2, NOx, and NH3 emissions to avoid a rapid increase in the particle pH. 
 HONO plays a crucial role as a precursor to OH radicals in the tropospheric atmosphere. The incongruity between HONO concentration and NOx emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic remains puzzling. Here, we show evidence from field observations of 10 sites in China where there was a noticeable increase in NH3 concentrations during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the meteorological conditions, the significant decrease in sulfate and nitrate concentrations enhanced the conversion of NH4+ to NH3. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the decrease in anion concentrations (especially sulfate and nitrate) and the increase in cation concentrations during the COVID-19 pandemic led to an increase in particle pH. In other words, changes in the excess ammonia drove changes in particle pH that may consequently have impacted the rate of HONO formation. The calculation of reaction rates indicates that during the epidemic, the increase in pH may promote the generation of HONO by facilitating redox reactions, which highlights the importance of coordinating the control of SO2, NOx, and NH3 emissions."

Here we constrained the modeling results of carbonaceous aerosols by field observation in Northeast China, a historically overlooked but recently targeted region of national clean-air actions. Our study suggested that the simulation of agricultural fire emissions and secondary organic aerosols remains challenging. 
 Light-absorbing carbonaceous aerosols are important contributors to both air pollution and radiative forcing. However, their abundances and sources remain poorly constrained, as can be seen from the frequently identified discrepancies between the observed and modeled results. In this study, we focused on elemental carbon (EC; as a measure of black carbon) and light-absorbing organic carbon (i.e., BrC) in Northeast China, a new targeted region of the latest clean-air actions in China. Three campaigns were conducted during 2018–2021 in Harbin, covering distinct meteorological conditions and emission features. Various analytical methods were first evaluated, and the mass concentrations of both BrC and EC were validated. The validated BrC and EC measurement results were then used for source apportionment, together with other species including tracers (e.g., levoglucosan). The observation-based results suggested that despite the frigid winter in Harbin, the formation of secondary organic carbon (SOC) was enhanced at high levels of relative humidity (RH). This enhancement could also be captured by an air quality model incorporating heterogeneous chemistry. However, the model failed to reproduce the observed abundances of SOC, with significant underestimations regardless of RH levels. In addition, agricultural fires effectively increased the observation-based primary organic carbon (POC) concentrations and POC to EC ratios. Such roles of agricultural fires were not captured by the model, pointing to substantial underestimation of open burning emissions by the inventory. This problem merits particular attention for Northeast China, given its massive agricultural sector."

Although COS at ambient levels generally has poor storage stability, our approach involves the dilution of a gas mixture containing micromole-per-mole levels of COS, the stability of which was validated for more than 1 decade. The developed system has excellent dilution performance and will facilitate accurate instrumental calibration for atmospheric COS observation. 
 Atmospheric carbonyl sulfide (COS) has received increasing attention as a potential tracer for investigating the global carbon cycle. Owing to the irreversible photosynthetic absorption of COS, changes in the atmospheric COS mole fraction can be related to terrestrial gross primary production. However, the instability of COS in high-pressure cylinders has hampered the accurate determination of atmospheric COS. Here, we report a dynamic dilution method for generating reference gas mixtures containing COS at ambient levels (ca. 500 pmol mol−1). Our method combined a dynamic dilution system employing a high-accuracy mass flow measurement system and a dry reference gas mixture prepared gravimetrically as a parent gas mixture containing a micromole-per-mole level of COS filled in a high-pressure aluminium cylinder. The storage stability of COS at this level was experimentally validated for three gravimetrically prepared dry reference gases over a period of more than 1 decade. We evaluated the dilution performance of the developed method using a gravimetric parent gas mixture containing approximately 1 µmol mol−1 of COS and chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22). Excellent repeatability (0.2 % for COS and 0.4 % for HCFC-22 in terms of relative standard deviation; RSD), reproducibility (COS: 0.1 %; HCFC-22: 0.3 %), and dilution linearity (R2>0.99 for both COS and HCFC-22) were obtained and were corroborated by the nearly constant ratio of the normalized gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS) response of COS to HCFC-22. The dilution accuracy was examined by comparing the determined HCFC-22 mole fractions in a dynamically diluted parent gas mixture from a mass flow rate measurement system and GC/MS calibrated using a gravimetrically diluted parent gas mixture. The mole fractions of HCFC-22 from these two methods agreed within an acceptable difference of approximately 2 pmol mol−1, validating the dilution accuracy of the developed method. By re-evaluating the experimental data, we determined the mole fractions of COS and HCFC-22 in an ambient-air-based reference gas mixture, with relative standard deviations of 0.1 % for COS and 0.3 % for HCFC-22. These results demonstrated that the developed method can accurately generate reference gas mixtures containing COS at ambient levels, which we expect will support long-term observations of atmospheric COS."

First, we enhance the inverse-distance-weighting algorithm by incorporating quality flag information, assigning weights that are inversely proportional to the number of unreliable grids. Second, we leverage a spatiotemporal merging method to address both spatial and temporal variability. Finally, we estimate the mean field values for GEMS AOD data, enhancing our understanding of the impact of aerosols on climate change. 
 This study presents advancements in the processing of satellite remote sensing data, focusing mainly on aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals from the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS). The transformation of Level-2 (L2) data, which includes atmospheric-state retrievals, into higher-quality Level-3 (L3) data is crucial in remote sensing. Our contributions lie in two novel improvements to the processing algorithm. First, we improve the inverse-distance-weighting algorithm by incorporating quality flag information into the weight calculation. By assigning weights that are inversely proportional to the number of unreliable grids, the method can provide more accurate L3 products. We validate this approach through simulation studies and apply it to GEMS AOD data across various regions and wavelengths. The use of quality flags in the algorithm can provide a more accurate analysis of remote sensing. Second, we employ a spatiotemporal merging method to address both spatial and temporal variability in AOD data, a departure from previous approaches that solely focused on spatial variability. Our method considers temporal variations spanning previous time intervals. Furthermore, the computed mean fields show similar spatiotemporal patterns to previous studies, confirming their ability to capture real-world phenomena. Lastly, utilizing this procedure, we compute the mean field estimates for GEMS AOD data, which can provide a deeper understanding of the impact of aerosols on climate change and public health."

Previous studies using water isotope observations and modelling have highlighted the importance of understanding spatial and temporal isotopic variability for a quantitative interpretation of these tracers. Here we present the first results of a high-resolution regional dynamical model (at 1/12° horizontal resolution) developed for the Mediterranean Sea, one of the hotspots of ongoing climate change. 
 Stable water isotopes (δ18Ow and δDw) have been successfully implemented for the first time in a high-resolution model of the Mediterranean Sea (NEMO-MED12). In this numerical study, model results are compared with available in situ observations to evaluate the model performance of the present-day distribution of stable water isotopes and their relationship with salinity on a sub-basin scale. There is good agreement between the modelled and observed distributions of δ18Ow in the surface water. The model successfully simulates the observed east–west gradient of δ18Ow characterising surface, intermediate, and deep waters. The results also show good agreement between the simulated δDw and the in situ data. The δDw shows a strong linear relationship with δ18Ow (r2=0.98) and salinity (r2=0.94) for the whole Mediterranean Sea. Moreover, the modelled relationships between δ18Ow and salinity agree well with observations, with a weaker slope in the eastern basin than in the western basin. We investigate the relationship of the isotopic signature of the planktonic foraminifera shells (δ18Oc) with temperature and the influence of seasonality. Our results suggest a more quantitative use of δ18O records, combining reconstruction with modelling approaches."

Although addressing plastic pollution through the life-cycle approach is crucial, the environmental impacts of typical plastic additive-related chemicals in PVC plastics during the cradle-to-gate stage remain unexplored. Consequently, managing the life-cycle environmental impacts of these additives remains challenging. Herein, the environmental impacts of 23 typical plastic additive-related chemicals and six PVC plastic products were evaluated throughout the cradle-to-gate life-cycle stage using a life cycle assessment–material flow analysis (LCA-MFA) coupled model. The results indicate that plastic additives significantly contribute to the environmental impacts of PVC plastic products across various end point indicators, ranging from 8.7 to 40.6%. Additionally, scenario analysis (SA) reveals that conventional strategies for addressing plastic pollution may not be highly effective in mitigating the environmental impacts associated with plastic additives. Specifically, compared to primary polymers, these additives exhibit 4 to 13% lower mitigation potential under the same policy scenarios. However, technical adjustment strategies targeting additives show a mitigation potential of 12 to 39%, suggesting that guiding the plastic additive industry toward green transformation is a key strategy for reducing environmental impacts."

This study aims to examine the external exposome, encompassing individual and environmental factors influencing health over the life course, and to perform dimension reduction to derive interpretable characterization of the external exposome for multicountry epidemiological studies. Analyzing data from over 25 million individuals across seven European countries including 12 administrative and traditional cohorts, we utilized domain-specific principal component analysis (PCA) to define the external exposome, focusing on air pollution, the built environment, and air temperature. We conducted linear regression to estimate the association between individual- and area-level socioeconomic position and each domain of the external exposome. Consistent exposure patterns were observed within countries, indicating the representativeness of traditional cohorts for air pollution and the built environment. However, cohorts with limited geographical coverage and Southern European countries displayed lower temperature variability, especially in the cold season, compared to Northern European countries and cohorts including a wide range of urban and rural areas. The individual- and area-level socioeconomic determinants (i.e., education, income, and unemployment rate) of the urban exposome exhibited significant variability across the European region, with area-level indicators showing stronger associations than individual variables. While the PCA approach facilitated common interpretations of the external exposome for air pollution and the built environment, it was less effective for air temperature. The diverse socioeconomic determinants suggest regional variations in environmental health inequities, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions across European countries."

Intermediates with terminal oxo ligands can undergo the oxygen atom exchange process with water molecules, whereas peroxides are unable to induce such exchanges. Therefore, these distinct metal–oxygen complexes can be distinguished based on the above feature. In this study, we identified previously unknown intermediates with a peroxy moiety and cobalt center that were generated during peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation via aqueous CoII ions under acidic conditions. Results of theoretical calculations and tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy revealed that the CoII ion tended to coordinate with the PMS anion to form a bidentate complex with a tetrahedral structure. These reactive cobalt intermediates were collectively named the CoII-PMS* complex. Depending on the inherent characteristics of the target contaminants, the CoII-PMS* complex can directly oxidize organic compounds or trigger PMS disproportionation to release hydroxyl radicals and sulfate radicals for collaborative decontamination. This work provides a comparative study between iron- and cobalt-based Fenton-like processes and proposes novel insights from the standpoint of diverse metal–oxygen complexes."

Herein, we placed earthworms in soils contaminated with different concentrations (0.02% and 0.2% w/w) of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) MPs to investigate the effect of earthworms on tomato against Helicoverpa armigera (H. armigera) under MPs stress. We found that earthworms alleviated the inhibitory effects of MPs stress on tomato growth and disrupted H. armigera growth. Compared to individual MPs exposure, earthworm incorporation significantly increased the silicon and lignin content in herbivore-damaged tomato leaves by 19.1% and 57.6%, respectively. Metabolites involved in chemical defense (chlorogenic acid) and phytohormones (jasmonic acid) were also activated by earthworm incorporation. Furthermore, earthworms effectively reduced oxidative damage induced by H. armigera via promoting antioxidant metabolism. Overall, our results suggest that utilizing earthworms to regulate above- and below-ground interactions could be a promising strategy for promoting green agriculture."

Here, we applied high-resolution chemical exposomics to plasma of 46 adults, each sampled 6 times over 2 years in a multiomic cohort, resulting in 276 individual exposomes. In addition to quantitative analysis of 83 priority target analytes, we discovered and semiquantified substances that have rarely or never been reported in humans, including personal care products, pesticide transformation products, and polymer additives. Hierarchical cluster analysis for 519 confidently annotated substances revealed unique and distinctive coexposures, including clustered pesticides, poly(ethylene glycols), chlorinated phenols, or natural substances from tea and coffee; interactive heatmaps were publicly deposited to support open exploration of the complex (meta)data. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for all annotated substances demonstrated the relatively low stability of the exposome compared to that of proteome, microbiome, and endogenous small molecules. Implications are that the chemical exposome must be measured more frequently than other omics in longitudinal studies and four longitudinal exposure types are defined that can be considered in study design. In this small cohort, mixed-effect models nevertheless revealed significant associations between testosterone and perfluoroalkyl substances, demonstrating great potential for longitudinal exposomics in precision health research."

However, collecting representative eDNA samples from these high and complex environments remains challenging. Traditional methods, such as surface swabbing or tree rolling, are labor-intensive and require significant effort to achieve adequate coverage. This study proposes a novel approach for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect eDNA within tree canopies by using a surface swabbing technique. The method involves lowering a probe from a hovering UAV into the canopy and collecting eDNA as it descends and ascends through branches and leaves. To achieve this, a custom-designed robotic system was developed featuring a winch and a probe for eDNA collection. The design of the probe was optimized, and a control logic for the winch was developed to reduce the risk of entanglement while ensuring sufficient interaction force to facilitate transfer of eDNA onto the probe. The effectiveness of this method was demonstrated during the XPRIZE Rainforest Semi-Finals as 10 eDNA samples were collected from the rainforest canopy, and a total of 152 molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) were identified using eDNA metabarcoding. We further investigate how the number of probe interactions with vegetation, the penetration depth, and the sampling duration influence the DNA concentration and community composition of the samples."

The oxidizing capacity of the Ni catalyst/oxyanion varied depending on the oxyanion type. Ni catalyst/PMS (or HOCl) degraded a broad spectrum of organics, whereas PDS enabled selective phenol oxidation. This stemmed from the differential reactivity of two high-valent Ni intermediates, Ni(III) and Ni(IV). A high similarity with Ni(III)OOH in a substrate-specific reactivity indicated the role of Ni(III) as the primary oxidant of Ni-activated PDS. With the minor progress of redox reactions with radical probes and multiple spectroscopic evidence on moderate Ni(III) accumulation, the significant elimination of non-phenolic contaminants by NiOOH/PMS (or HOCl) suggested the involvement of Ni(IV) in the substrate-insensitive treatment capability of Ni catalyst/PMS (or HOCl). Since the electron-transfer oxidation of organics by high-valent Ni species involved Ni(II) regeneration, the loss of the treatment efficiency of Ni/oxyanion was marginal over multiple catalytic cycles."

The initial shift to the negative phase of Tropical Pacific Decadal Variability (TPDV) is primarily driven by the upward and eastward migration of isopycnal negative temperature anomalies along the equator. Subsequently, the wind fields associated with the negative phase of the Pacific Meridional Mode (PMM) induce anomalous vertical currents in the equatorial Pacific. This leads to anomalous upwelling and downwelling of mean temperature in the Niño4 and Niño3 regions, respectively, thereby strengthening and weakening the corresponding subsurface‐produced sea surface temperature anomalies. Our findings clarify the roles of subsurface temperature anomalies in the phase reversal of TPDV and PMM in amplifying decadal variance, specifically in the equatorial central Pacific."

However, the reasons remain uncertain. The Last Interglacial (LIG) climate provides a potential analog for future warming. Investigating ISMR responses to these two warming scenarios could help understand the causes of ISMR changes. Using PMIP4 simulations, we find that ISMR became “wetter and more stable” during the LIG, contrasting the future climate. The opposing changes in ISMR variability are related to divergent changes in the El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO) amplitudes, ENSO‐ISMR relationships, and ENSO‐induced large‐scale atmospheric circulation anomalies. During the LIG, orbital forcing weakened ENSO variability and its impacts on ISMR. A westward positioning of ENSO shifted the atmospheric circulation anomalies westward, suppressing extreme ISMR anomalies. These processes are supported by atmospheric model simulations. Our results suggest that different warming patterns (dynamic effects) are more critical than moisture‐increasing effects in controlling regional climate variability."

We trained NWM‐CNN on 780 flood events, at a 250 m resolution with an RMSE of 4.58% on held out validation geographies. We demonstrate NWM‐CNN across California during the 2023 atmospheric rivers, comparing predictions against Sentinel‐1 mapped flood observations. We compared historical predictions from 1979 to 2023 to flood damage reports in Sacramento County, California. Results show that NWM‐CNN captures inundation extent better than the Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) approach (25%–36% RMSE, respectively)."

Specifically, it aims to improve our understanding of how both the clouds and the relatively cool, moist afternoon sea breeze impact the Urban Heat Island (UHI) and Heat Index (HI). During the warm season, the afternoon sea breeze phenomenon in this coastal city acts as a natural air conditioner for city residents, facilitating the dispersion of moisture, heat, and pollutants. To investigate the relationship among urbanization, clouds, and land‐sea interactions, we conducted cloud‐ and urban‐resolving simulations at a 900 m grid resolution and perform simulation scenarios aiming to isolate urbanization, clouds and land‐sea circulations. Results show that urbanization correlates with the presence of shallow cumulus clouds, higher cloud bases, and increased cloud duration over the Galveston‐Houston region compared to rural areas. These urban clouds benefit from the enhanced moist static energy that is favored by intensifying vertical mixing and moisture flux convergence. Urbanization raises the mean HI while mitigating its afternoon HI high. We found that the urban circulation dome overwhelms the sensitivity of the sea breeze to the urbanization. Instead, the influence of urbanization on cloud enhancement emerges as a crucial pathway responsible for reducing the high afternoon HI values. Moreover, uncertainties in SSTs are closely linked to the sensitivities of land‐sea circulations, which in turn modulate UHI and HI."

L. Ekman;Rodrigo Caballero,Moisture and Aerosols as Key Drivers of the Turbulent State of Arctic Mixed‐Phase Clouds During Idealized Moist Intrusions,"Previous studies have shown that low‐level mixed‐phase clouds that form during idealized moist intrusions into the Arctic can exist in either a stable (stratus) or a convective (stratocumulus) state. Here, we examine the conditions that promote a transition from the stable to the convective state through idealized simulations using a three‐dimensional large‐eddy simulation model coupled with a one‐dimensional multilayer sea ice model. We find that the vertical distribution of the initial dew point temperature (Td) profile fundamentally influences whether a transition between the two states occurs or not. If the initial moisture content of the advected airmass decreases rapidly with height, then a turbulent transition is likely to occur and a stratocumulus cloud can form. However, the availability and properties of aerosols as well as the cloud ice content can delay or even prevent stratocumulus formation, regardless if the conditions in terms of the initial Td profile are favorable. A low cloud ice water content promotes a stably stratified cloud layer and delays the transition. Furthermore, if no cloud condensation nuclei are available at the base of the cloud when a cloud‐layer instability forms, then there is no new droplet formation, the buoyancy remains low and the cloud remains as a stratus. Our results suggest that the low‐level mixed‐phase cloud evolution and the thermodynamic transition of an airmass during a moist intrusion into the Arctic are closely linked to the aerosol processing by the cloud, that is, a chemical transformation, and that the two processes should be considered simultaneously."

The Arctic SIC‐forced teleconnection is associated with a warm Arctic‐cold Eurasian pattern of surface temperature (T2m), a low Arctic‐high Eurasian pattern of sea level pressure (SLP), and a southeastward propagating wave‐train originating from Arctic in the upper troposphere. The ENSO‐forced teleconnection is associated with a poleward propagating wave‐train originating from tropical Pacific in the upper troposphere, a low North Pacific‐high Arctic pattern of SLP, and a cold North Pacific‐warm Greenland pattern of T2m. The metrics of Taylor skill scores and Distance between indices of simulation and observation (DISO) are used to objectively and quantitatively evaluate the performance of models. The results of subjective and objective evaluation are essentially consistent.

All pressures are expected to worsen in the future under business‐as‐usual scenarios (or similar) based on past trajectories and/or models of future scenarios. Eight of the pressures assessed have not been projected into the future (diseases and pathogens, introduced coastal wildlife predation, disruption to sediment dynamics, wildlife strikes, organic and inorganic chemical pollution, light and noise pollution), likely due to the limited availability of data describing current pressures, the challenges of modeling future pressures, and high levels of uncertainty.

To better understand these dynamics, this study leverages historical forest‐based wind damage data in the United States and applies this information as shocks within a global forest sector outlook model. A large, localized wind event modeled as a shock to the US South creates a one‐time increase of 18.7 million m3 from salvage harvest operations, equal to over 4% of national harvest. This crowds out traditional harvest activities, leading to downward pressure on prices in the short run, followed by a persistent effect that could take approximately 25 years to dissipate from markets. Average annual wind damage contributes downward pressure on roundwood prices between 1% and 4% in the United States, and this effect is distributed to other countries. The findings suggest that large, localized shocks reverberate across regions and wood product markets due to their interconnected supply chains and trade patterns, and these impacts have important temporal dynamics. Another key result is that the magnitude of these effects are offset by endogenous market reactions in other markets. In other words, unaffected regions change their harvesting patterns in order to compensate for changes in the availability of fiber, shedding light on the importance of capturing global channels as large shocks materialize in changes in market dynamics internationally. Monte Carlo simulations suggest a wide confidence band on salvage harvest rates and prices."

 Since the 1970s, Arctic sea ice has undergone unprecedented change, becoming thinner, less extensive and less resilient to summer melt. Snow’s high albedo greatly reduces solar absorption in sea ice and the upper ocean, which mitigates sea–ice melt and ocean warming. However, the drivers of summertime snow depth variability are unknown. The Arctic Oscillation is a mode of natural climate variability, influencing Arctic snowfall and air temperatures. Thus, it may affect summertime snow conditions on Arctic sea ice. Here we examine the role of the Arctic Oscillation in summer snow depth variability on Arctic sea ice in 1980–2020 using atmospheric reanalysis, snow modelling and satellite data. The positive phase leads to greater snow accumulation, ranging up to ~4.5 cm near the North Pole, and higher surface albedo in summer. There are more intense, frequent Arctic cyclones, cooler temperatures aloft and greater snowfall relative to negative and neutral phases; these conditions facilitate a more persistent summer snow cover, which may lessen sea-ice melt and ocean warming. The Arctic Oscillation influence on summertime snow weakens after 2007, which suggests that future warming and Arctic sea-ice loss might modify the relationship between the Arctic Oscillation and snow on Arctic sea ice.

 The mechanisms underlying the deformation and eventual destruction of Earth’s cratons remain enigmatic, despite proposed links to subduction and deep mantle plume processes. Here we study the deformation of the North China Craton using four-dimensional mantle flow models of the plate–mantle system since the late Mesozoic, integrating constraints from lithospheric deformation, mantle seismic tomography and the evolution of surface topography. We find that flat-slab subduction induced landward shortening and lithospheric thickening, while subsequent flat-slab rollback caused seaward extension and lithospheric thinning. Both subduction phases resulted in substantial topographic changes in basin sediments. Rapid flat-slab rollback, coupled with a viscosity jump and phase change across the 660 km mantle discontinuity, was a key ingredient in shaping a large mantle wedge. We argue that craton deformation through lithospheric extension and thinning was triggered by the subduction of a flat slab and its subsequent rollback. The integration of data into mechanical models provides insights into the four-dimensional dynamic interplay involving subduction, mantle processes, craton deformation and topography.

 Spatiotemporal structured light has opened up new avenues for optics and photonics. Current spatiotemporal manipulation of light mostly relies on phase-only devices such as liquid crystal spatial light modulators to generate spatiotemporal optical fields with unique photonic properties. However, simultaneous manipulation of both amplitude and phase of the complex field for the spatiotemporal light is still lacking, limiting the diversity and richness of achievable photonic properties.

This study finds that incorporating delayed phenotypic plasticity in mosquito traits significantly enhances the accuracy of dengue risk predictions. 
 The incidence of vector-borne disease is on the rise globally, with burdens increasing in endemic countries and outbreaks occurring in new locations. Effective mitigation and intervention strategies require models that accurately predict both spatial and temporal changes in disease dynamics, but this remains challenging due to the complex and interactive relationships between environmental variation and the vector traits that govern the transmission of vector-borne diseases. Predictions of disease risk in the literature typically assume that vector traits vary instantaneously and independently of population density, and therefore do not capture the delayed response of these same traits to past biotic and abiotic environments. We argue here that to produce accurate predictions of disease risk it is necessary to account for environmentally driven and delayed instances of phenotypic plasticity. To show this, we develop a stage and phenotypically structured model for the invasive mosquito vector, Aedes albopictus, and dengue, the second most prevalent human vector-borne disease worldwide. We find that environmental variation drives a dynamic phenotypic structure in the mosquito population, which accurately predicts global patterns of mosquito trait-abundance dynamics. In turn, this interacts with disease transmission to capture historic dengue outbreaks. By comparing the model to a suite of simpler models, we reveal that it is the delayed phenotypic structure that is critical for accurate prediction. Consequently, the incorporation of vector trait relationships into transmission models is critical to improvement of early warning systems that inform mitigation and control strategies. There is a need for accurate models to predict disease dynamics by considering the interactions between environment and vector traits.

 G protein-coupled receptors’ conformational landscape can be affected by their local, microscopic interactions within the cell plasma membrane. We employ here a pleiotropic stimulus, namely osmotic swelling, to alter the cortical environment within intact cells and monitor the response in terms of receptor function and downstream signaling. We observe that in osmotically swollen cells the β2-adrenergic receptor, a prototypical GPCR, favors an active conformation, resulting in cAMP transient responses to adrenergic stimulation that have increased amplitude. The results are validated in primary cell types such as adult cardiomyocytes, a model system where swelling occurs upon ischemia-reperfusion injury. Our results suggest that receptors’ function is finely modulated by their biophysical context, and specifically that osmotic swelling acts as a potentiator of downstream signaling, not only for the β2-adrenergic receptor, but also for other receptors, hinting at a more general regulatory mechanism.

 Tumour detection with high selectivity and sensitivity is crucial for delineating tumour margins and identifying metastatic foci during image-guided surgery. Optical nanoprobes with preferential tumour accumulation is often limited by inefficient amplification of biological signals. Here, we report the design of a library of hydrophobic core-tunable ultra-pH-sensitive nanoprobes (HUNPs) for orthogonally amplifying tumour microenvironmental signals on multiple tumour models.

Our operando electrochemical characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that copper atoms in the Cuδ+NCN complex enhance carbon dioxide activation by improving surface carbon monoxide adsorption, while delocalized electrons around copper sites facilitate carbon-carbon coupling by reducing the Gibbs free energy for *CHC formation. This leads to high selectivity for ethylene production. The Cuδ+NCN catalyst achieves 77.7% selectivity for carbon dioxide to ethylene conversion at a partial current density of 400 milliamperes per square centimeter and demonstrates long-term stability over 80 hours in membrane electrode assembly-based electrolysers. This study provides a strategic approach for designing catalysts for the electrosynthesis of value-added chemicals from carbon dioxide. This study reports a cyanamide-framework stabilized multivalent copper catalyst for efficient electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to ethylene with 77.7% selectivity at 400 mA cm−2, offering a rational strategy for CO2 conversion."

Here, the authors show that reactivated astrocytes secrete clusterin to impede remyelination by blocking astrocytic removal of myelin debris and oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation in mouse models of demyelination. 
 Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating demyelinating disease characterized by remyelination failure attributed to inadequate oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) differentiation and aberrant astrogliosis. A comprehensive cell atlas reanalysis of clinical specimens brings to light heightened clusterin (CLU) expression in a specific astrocyte subtype links to active lesions in MS patients. Our investigation reveals elevated astrocytic CLU levels in both active lesions of patient tissues and female murine MS models. CLU administration stimulates primary astrocyte proliferation while concurrently impeding astrocyte-mediated clearance of myelin debris. Intriguingly, CLU overload directly impedes OPC differentiation and induces OPCs and OLs apoptosis. Mechanistically, CLU suppresses PI3K-AKT signaling in primary OPCs via very low-density lipoprotein receptor. Pharmacological activation of AKT rescues the damage inflicted by excess CLU on OPCs and ameliorates demyelination in the corpus callosum. Furthermore, conditional knockout of CLU emerges as a promising intervention, showcasing improved remyelination processes and reduced severity in murine MS models.

 Microbial secretions, such as metabolic enzymes, are often considered to be cooperative public goods as they are costly to produce but can be exploited by others. They create incentives for the evolution of non-producers, which can drive producer and population productivity declines. In response, producers can adjust production levels. Past studies suggest that while producers lower production to reduce costs and exploitation opportunities when under strong selection pressure from non-producers, they overproduce secretions when these pressures are weak. We challenge the universality of this trend with the production of a metabolic enzyme, invertase, by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which catalyses sucrose hydrolysis into two hexose molecules. Contrary to past studies, overproducers evolve during evolutionary experiments even when under strong selection pressure from non-producers. Phenotypic and competition assays with a collection of synthetic strains - engineered to have modified metabolic attributes - identify two mechanisms for suppressing the benefits of invertase to those who exploit it. Invertase overproduction increases extracellular hexose concentrations that suppresses the metabolic efficiency of competitors, due to the rate-efficiency trade-off, and also enhances overproducers’ hexose capture rate by inducing transporter expression. Thus, overproducers are maintained in the environment originally thought to not support public goods production. Microbial secretions can be costly to produce and exploited by others. Here, the authors use experimentally evolved yeasts to show that, in spite of exploitative non-producers, overproducers are maintained in the population, supporting public goods production."

 The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation is an important component of the climate system because of its role in the heat transport. Its strength is sensitive to the surface density but mechanisms of the effect of Southern Ocean freshwater anomalies are relatively unknown. Here, we investigate the impact of Antarctic ice sheet meltwater on the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation using an earth system model of intermediate complexity. The meltwater over the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean is transported to the east and, after passing the Drake Passage, travels northward reaching the North Atlantic. Furthermore, Southern Ocean cooling induces a northward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, leading to more precipitation in the tropical Atlantic. Consequently, the reduced salinity weakens the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. Additional experiments, in which the duration period of freshwater hosing was varied while keeping its total amount constant, indicate that the amplitude and the duration of the meltwater play crucial roles in determining the degree of reduction in Atlantic meridional overturning circulation.

 Low solubility and low reactivity towards organic compounds make phosphorus a problematic element for the origin and early evolution of life. Reduced and polymerized phosphorus species are more bioavailable and may resolve these issues, but widespread formation pathways for these species are not well understood. Here we show, using experiments and thermodynamic modelling, that diverse polyphosphates (straight-chains with up to five and cyclophosphates with three and four phosphate molecules) and reduced phosphite can form under ferruginous anhydrous conditions at 80-700 °C. We find that hydrogen and temperature enhance phosphite production while polyphosphate formation maximizes at moderate temperatures (175-200 °C). Chromite and Nickel-bearing minerals enhance phosphate polymerization and reduction whereas magnetite inhibits them. These findings expand on previous investigations of thermally induced changes in phosphorus-speciation and show that these reactions may be widespread in nature. Metamorphism of ferruginous sediments, serpentinization, as well as subaerial lakes exposed to volcanic heating could potentially produce a wealth of polyphosphates along with phosphite on the early Earth. Later, these species may have participated in prebiotic phosphorylation reactions upon liberation by subsequent fluid infiltration. Our results thus offer a more widespread pathway for the generation of reactive phosphorus for the origin of life.

An episodic dynamo, seemingly recorded by some Apollo basalts, is temporally and energetically problematic. We evaluate this enigma through study of ~3.7 billion-year-old (Ga) Apollo basalts 70035 and 75035. Whole rock analyses show unrealistically high nominal magnetizations, whereas SCP indicate null fields, illustrating that the former do not record an episodic dynamo.

 Artisanal and small-scale mining is an important livelihood activity in many biodiversity hotspots. There is substantial international concern about the negative impact of artisanal and small-scale mining on biodiversity, yet in most places this remains poorly understood. We explore the impacts of a high-profile mining rush: the 2016 sapphire rush at Bemainty, Eastern Madagascar, where tens of thousands of miners descended on a protected forest. Media coverage claimed the rush caused hundreds of hectares of deforestation and threatened lemur populations.

 Satellite altimetry data has become essential for studying the dynamics of water bodies, especially in regions with limited or inaccessible data. Traditional low-resolution mode (LRM) satellites' accuracy cannot be guaranteed when it comes to assessing water levels in small- (< 200 m in width) and medium-sized (200–800 m in width) rivers. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) altimeters, exemplified by Sentinel-3 A, have shown great potential for inland water altimetry. Nevertheless, developing algorithms to retrack the raw data remains an essential requirement in this context. This is attributed to the width of small-sized rivers, which is often narrower than the along-track resolution of both LRM and SAR altimeters. In addition, new altimeters may have long revisit cycles and different spatial coverage and cannot yield historical data necessary in some situations.To address these challenges, this study proposed a conditional threshold retracker (CTR). The CTR algorithm is well-designed and facilitates accurate water level monitoring. Moreover, we proposed an enhanced footprint filter (EFF), thus significantly bolstering the number of available cycles. Our findings demonstrate that the developed method substantially enhances the temporal and spatial resolution of both LRM and SAR altimetry satellites during water level monitoring in rivers of different climate types. The width of the thirteen selected rivers is on the order of 85–630 m. The CTR significantly improved the water level monitoring accuracy by 68 %–78 %. Furthermore, the EFF increased the number of water level cycles by approximately 49 %–68 %.

 The fraction of green vegetation is a widely-used indicator of vegetation abundance at regional and/or global scales. The pixel mixture model, especially the dimidiate pixel model (DPM, also referred to as two-endmember model) based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), plays an important role in the accurate estimation of fractional vegetation cover (FVC) via remote sensing. The two components in the traditional DPM are vegetation and soil (both sunlit and shaded). However, to date, the influence of shaded vegetation and shaded soil has not been fully considered in the NDVI-based DPM. Herein we analyze the necessity and feasibility of processing shaded components separately. The shaded soil was found to largely affect the canopy NDVI and can be combined with the vegetation (both sunlit and shaded) as one of the two components in DPM due to the high NDVI of shaded soil under a small percentage of diffuse sky radiation (< 10 % of the total hemispherical radiation in red band in this study). This finding partially explains why the canopy NDVI is oversensitive to background. The DPM was then improved with the solar and view angles to account for the fraction of shaded soil. We performed simulation and field measurements to validate the proposed models to varying factors including the vegetation structure, soil background, solar and view geometry, and slope gradient. The improved DPMs outperformed the traditional DPM (i.e., where no effect of shaded soil is considered) when estimating the NDVI and FVC of the mixed pixel. The FVC estimated with traditional DPM results in the RMSE from 0.14 to 0.31, and that with the improved DPMs range from 0.04 to 0.13. The decrease of uncertainty by using the improved DPMs was generally over 50 % when compared to the output from a traditional DPM. The proposed DPM maintains the advantage of an easy-of-use two-component mixture model yet is more accurate than traditional ones and thus expected to improve the FVC estimation from satellite data."

 Accurate long-term monitoring of wetlands using satellite archives is crucial for effective conservation. While new methods based on temporal profile classification have been useful for long-term monitoring of wetlands, their advantages over traditional classification methods have not yet been demonstrated. This study aimed to compare continuous change detection (using the continuous change detection and classification (CCDC) algorithm) to traditional post-classification change detection for monitoring wetland changes between 1984 and 2022 in a temperate coastal marsh (Marais Poitevin, France) from the Landsat archive. The reference dataset was collected mainly from field observations and used to train and test a random forest classifier. The accuracy of the resulting change map was then assessed for both methods using validation points collected via visual interpretation of historical aerial photographs and Landsat temporal profiles. The change map derived from CCDC had much higher unbiased overall accuracy (0.86 ± 0.02) than that derived from post-classification change detection (0.51 ± 0.03). In addition, wetland loss was much higher than wetland gain (18 % and 2 % of the area, respectively) and was due mainly to conversion of grassland to cropland and urbanization. The study demonstrated that, unlike traditional post-classification change detection, continuous change detection provides maps of wetland changes sufficiently accurate for operational use by managers.

 Rapid and accurate assessment of affected areas is crucial for post-earthquake rescue efforts, as earthquakes can lead to extensive damage and casualties. The post-earthquake damage assessment method based on SAR coherence is widely utilized, but issues such as inadequate consideration of decorrelation factors and underutilization of preseismic coherence can negatively impact assessment outcomes. To address these limitations and enhance accuracy while reducing false alarms, we propose a novel approach for post-earthquake building damage assessment utilizing a SAR coherence time matrix. The proposed method involves constructing time matrices by computing preseismic image coherence to maximize the utilization of preseismic coherence information. By developing a Vision Transformer model within the realm of deep learning, we aimed to extract features from these time matrices based on their unique characteristics. Through the use of predicted values obtained from the trained model to simulate coseismic coherence, a scoring metric was established as a proxy for damage. This novel method was successfully applied to evaluate the damage caused by the 2016 Italy earthquake and the 2023 Turkey earthquake, yielding improved accuracy and reduced false alarm rates. The research findings demonstrate the transferability and reliability of this method, presenting it as an accurate and dependable tool for post-earthquake building damage assessment."

We argue that male infants born from twin gestations, in which one fetus died in utero (i.e., the vanishing twin syndrome), contribute to the disparity. We cannot directly test our argument because “vanishing” typically occurs before clinical recognition of pregnancy. We, however, describe and find associations that would emerge in vital statistics were our argument correct. Among male periviable singleton births from 288 monthly conception cohorts (January 1995 through December 2018), we found an average NH white advantage of 30 grams (759 grams versus 729 grams). Consistent with our argument, however, cohorts signaling relatively few survivors of the vanishing twin syndrome showed no disparity."

However, because of limitations in materials, device structure, and fabrication methodology, the performance of these ultrathin devices and circuits is insufficient to support higher-level applications. Here, we report high-performance carbon nanotube–based thin-film transistors (TFTs) and differential amplifiers on ultrathin polyimide films with a total thickness of <180 nanometers. A dual-gate structure is introduced to guarantee excellent gate control efficiency and mechanical stability of the ultrathin TFTs, which exhibit high transconductance (8.96 microsiemens per micrometer), high mobility (127 square centimeters per volt per second), and steep subthreshold swing (84 millivolts per decade), and can sustain a bending radius of curvature of <10 micrometers. The differential amplifier achieves the highest gain-bandwidth product (1.83 megahertz) among flexible differential amplifiers, enabling higher-gain amplification of weak signals over an extended frequency spectrum that is demonstrated by amplification of electromyography signals in situ."

We report synthesis, transport properties, and osmotic energy harvesting performance of another member of the nanotube porin family: boron nitride nanotube porins (BNNTPs). Cryo–transmission electron microscopy imaging, liposome transport assays, and DNA translocation experiments show that BNNTPs reconstitute into lipid membranes to form functional channels of ~2-nm diameter. Ion transport studies reveal ion conductance characteristics of individual BNNTPs, which show an unusualC1/4scaling with ion concentration and pronounced pH sensitivity. Reversal potential measurements indicate that BNNTPs have strong cation selectivity at neutral pH, attributable to the high negative charge on the channel. BNNTPs also deliver very large power density up to 12 kW/m2in the osmotic gradient transport experiments at neutral pH, surpassing that of other BNNT-based devices by two orders of magnitude under similar conditions.

The o-Quality of sleep spindles correlates weakly with their amplitude, shows marked laminar differences and regional topography across cortical regions, reflects the level of synchrony within and between cortical networks, is strongly modulated by sleep-wake history, reflects the degree of sensory disconnection, and correlates with the strength of coupling between spindles and slow waves. As most spindle events are highly localized and not detectable with conventional low-density recording approaches, o-Quality thus emerges as a valuable metric that allows us to infer the spread and dynamics of spindle activity across the brain and directly links their spatiotemporal dynamics with local and global regulation of brain states, sleep regulation, and function."

While phosphorylation on serine-2/serine-5 of the carboxyl-terminal heptad repeats is well established, threonine-4’s role remains enigmatic. Paradoxically, threonine-4 phosphorylation was only detected after transcription end sites despite functionally implicated in pausing, elongation, termination, and messenger RNA processing. Our investigation revealed that threonine-4 phosphorylation detection was obstructed by flanking serine-5 phosphorylation at the onset of transcription, which can be removed selectively. Subsequent proteomic analyses identified many proteins recruited to transcription via threonine-4 phosphorylation, which previously were attributed to serine-2. Loss of threonine-4 phosphorylation greatly reduces serine-2 phosphorylation, revealing a cross-talk between the two marks. Last, the function analysis of the threonine-4 phosphorylation highlighted its role in alternative 3′-end processing within pro-proliferative genes. Our findings unveil the true genomic location of this evolutionarily conserved phosphorylation mark and prompt a reassessment of functional assignments of the carboxyl-terminal domain."

Cascade catalysis is a promising approach but limited by stringent purity demands of nexus molecules. We developed an abiotic/biotic cascade catalysis using blended nexus molecules forl-tyrosine synthesis. Specifically, we begin by constructing a solid-state reactor to reduce CO2electrochemically, yielding a mixture of acetic acid and ethanol, which serves as the blended nexus molecules. Subsequently, we use genetic engineering to introduce an ethanol utilization pathway and a tyrosine producing pathway toEscherichia colito facilitatel-tyrosine production. The ethanol pathway synergistically cooperated with the acetic acid pathway, boostingl-tyrosine production rate (nearly five times higher compared to the strain without ethanol utilization pathway) and enhancing carbon efficiency.

However, the viscosity of kimberlite magma, a factor governing its migration and eruption dynamics within Earth, remains poorly constrained. We conducted synchrotron in situ falling sphere viscometry experiments to examine kimberlite magma with different volatile contents (0 to 5 wt % H2O and 2 to 8 wt % CO2) under high pressure-temperature conditions. The results reveal that the viscosity of volatile-rich kimberlite magma is ~1 to 2 orders lower than that of mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) and comparable to the ultramobile pure carbonate melt. Using the measured viscosity values, we simulated the ascent and eruption process of kimberlite magma.

The director field resulting from the boundary conditions is calculated with Landau de Gennes theory and validated by comparing experimentally measured and theoretically predicted birefringence patterns. We demonstrate our procedures for structures of varying complexity and then employed them to fabricate 4D microstructures that show the desired actuation. Overall, we obtain excellent agreement between theory and experiment. This opens the door for rational design of functional materials for 4D (micro)printing in the future."

The lungs are densely innervated by nociceptor sensory neurons that mediate breathing, cough, and bronchoconstriction.

Ablation of nociceptors in mice increased lung CRKP clearance, suppressed trans-alveolar dissemination of CRKP, and protected mice from hypothermia and death. Furthermore, ablation of nociceptors enhanced the recruitment of neutrophils and Ly6Chimonocytes and cytokine induction. Depletion of Ly6Chimonocytes, but not of neutrophils, abrogated lung and extrapulmonary CRKP clearance in ablated mice, suggesting that Ly6Chimonocytes are a critical cellular population to regulate pneumonic sepsis.

Evidence includes a shifted partitioning of photosynthetically active radiation toward more isoprene emissions and synchronized declines in leaf and xylem water potentials. In addition, we find that convective storms attenuate light-driven ecosystem greening in the late dry season and then reverse to net leaf loss in the wet season, improving rainforest leaf area predictability by 24 to 31%.

Unexpectedly, the small GTPase Rho, a crucial regulator of cell movement, has been reported to be active in both local cell protrusions and retractions, raising the question of how Rho activity can coordinate cell migration. Here, we show that Rho activity is absent in local protrusions and active during retractions. During retractions, Rho rapidly activated ezrin-radixin-moesin proteins (ERMs) to increase actin-membrane attachment, and, with a delay, nonmuscle myosin 2 (NM2). Rho activity was excitable, with NM2 acting as a slow negative feedback regulator. Strikingly, inhibition of SLK/LOK kinases, through which Rho activates ERMs, caused elongated cell morphologies, impaired Rho-induced cell contractions, and reverted Rho-induced blebbing.

Electrical gating offers a promising route to control and study these effects, as static screening charges reside at the boundary. We investigate the modulation of the surface response upon direct electrical charging of single plasmonic nanoresonators. By analyzing measured changes in light scattering within the framework of surface response functions, we find the resonance shift well accounted for by modulation of the classical in-plane surface current. Unexpectedly, we also observed a change in the resonance width, indicating reduced losses for negatively charged resonators.

While enduring, this framework has limitations: Temporal pairing–based models of learning do not fit with many experimental observations and cannot be used to make quantitative predictions about behavior.

The fibers are actuated via a computer interface, enabling precise control over actuation direction, magnitude, and frequency. Unlike conventional methods, our technique initiates the actuation at the base of the fibers, which is enabled by fabricating the fibers directly onto an electrical circuit. Fiber actuation is achieved by localized addressing of an in situ formed radially aligned segment. This induces reduction in the scalar order parameter and leads to deformation of the fiber base, causing bending toward the activated region. Extensive modeling validates this actuation mechanism and identifies optimal conditions and actuation strategies for achieving the desired responses. The actuation process is rapid, is highly reversible, and maintains excellent performance over repeated (>200) cycles. These liquid crystal fiber arrays provide a safe contact with humans or other objects, making them highly suitable for applications in smart wearable devices and immersive interfaces."
