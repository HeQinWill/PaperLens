Merrill),"Soil available-iron (Fe) is crucial for various physiological properties and processes in plants, particularly those related to the accumulation and translocation of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). However, the mechanisms underlying the impact of available-Fe levels on PFAS accumulation and translocation in plants remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the impacts of available-Fe levels on the accumulation of an emerging PFAS, 6:2 chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonate (6:2 Cl-PFESA), in soybean, a typical dicot, through hydroponic experiments. Interestingly, Fe deficiency significantly enhanced soybean root volume, surface area, root tip count, and lipid content, thus favoring 6:2 Cl-PFESA adsorption on the root epidermis. However, its absorption and translocation to aboveground tissues were markedly suppressed due to significantly reduced transpiration rate and soluble protein content induced by Fe deficiency. Conversely, although excessive available-Fe also inhibited transpiration, it notably increased root membrane permeability and soluble protein content in aboveground tissues, thus greatly facilitating the absorption and translocation of 6:2 Cl-PFESA within soybeans. These findings demonstrate that appropriate Fe application in agricultural soils is essential to promote the growth of dicot crops and mitigate the potential ecological risks associated with the accumulation of 6:2 Cl-PFESA in the aboveground tissues of soybeans."

Since 2020, fuel sulfur (S) content limits have been reduced, requiring either the use of low-S fuels or the installation of marine scrubbers to continue using heavy fuel oil (HFO). While scrubbers are a widely adopted solution for reducing S emissions, their benefits are controversial and uncertainty remains regarding scrubber environmental impacts and their appropriate evaluation. Here, we systematically assess the environmental impacts of scrubbers operating on HFO to those of low-S fuels across various categories, through a measurement-informed Well-to-Wake (WtW) life cycle assessment (LCA). Gaseous and particulate matter (PM) emissions data were collected while a bulk carrier vessel was burning 3% S HFO, 0.1% S marine gas oil (MGO), and 0.5% S very low-S fuel oil (VLSFO) under similar engine operating modes during an actual ocean voyage. Seawater and washwater samples were also analyzed, alongside fuel, cylinder oil, and lubricant samples. The results suggest that, in various instances the use of HFO with a scrubber can be considered equivalent to MGO use while outperforming VLSFO use from a WtW perspective, for large, ocean-going bulk carrier vessels in open seas. These findings indicate that end-of-pipe solutions may not always be inferior to start-of-pipe alternatives, underscoring the need for comprehensive LCA studies to properly assess emission abatement technologies."

While previous studies have highlighted inconsistent toxicity levels of NPs, knowledge remains limited about the specific effects of different NPs on embryonic development, early life-stage behaviors, and bodily uptake. This study examines the effects of polystyrene NPs (PS-NPs) with different surface charges, plain polystyrene (PS), amino-modified (PS-NH2), and carboxyl-modified (PS-COOH) on zebrafish early life stages. High-resolution 3D bioimaging confirmed differential internalization: PS-COOH accumulated in the yolk and intestine, while PS-NH2 localized mainly in the intestine. PS-NPs up to 10 ppm did not significantly affect mortality or hatching rates, likely due to effective dialysis, minimizing toxic chemical leaching. PS-NP exposure led to noninflated swim bladders and affected swimming. RNA sequencing identified impacted neurological molecular pathways like circadian rhythm and visual function; weighted gene coexpression network analysis indicated strong correlations between key gene modules and phenotypic traits like eye development and dopamine level. We highlight the low acute toxicity of clean dialyzed NPs despite bodily uptake and surface-charge-dependent sublethal neurotoxicity. Overall, plain PS-NPs induced significant individual-level effects, while charged PS-NPs caused stronger molecular-level alterations; toxicity profiles varied across biological levels, complicating hazard assessment and underscoring the need for population-level studies on ecological impacts."

Wogelius;Edward Keavney,Direct Evidence That Microplastics Are Transported to the Deep Sea by Turbidity Currents,"Microplastics pervade the global seafloor, yet the mechanisms by which this pollutant is increasingly transported to the deep sea remain unclear. Fast-moving sediment avalanches (called turbidity currents) are hypothesized to efficiently transport microplastics into the deep sea. However, while this has been inferred from field sampling of the seafloor, it has never been demonstrated outside of a laboratory setting. Here, we provide direct field-scale evidence that turbidity currents in submarine canyons not only transport globally significant volumes of mineral and organic matter into the deep sea but also carry large quantities of anthropogenic particles, including microfibers and microplastic fragments. In situ hydrodynamic monitoring, coupled with direct sampling of the seafloor and material suspended by turbidity currents, reveals that even a submarine canyon whose head lies hundreds of kilometers from land acts as an efficient conduit to flush sediment and pollutants from the continental shelf to water depths greater than 3200 m. Frequent and fast turbidity currents supply oxygen and nutrients that sustain deep-sea biodiversity and fishing grounds in, and adjacent to, such canyons. Our study therefore confirms that these biodiversity hotspots are colocated with microplastic hotspots, indicating that the more than 5000 land-detached canyons worldwide can be important but previously unproven conveyors of anthropogenic pollution to the deep sea."

Fernø;Nicole Dopffel,Growth on Hydrogen by the Sulfate-Reducing Oleidesulfovibrio alaskensis Induces Biofilm Dispersion and Detachment─Implications for Underground Hydrogen Storage,"Hydrogen is a versatile energy carrier for human activity but is also a ubiquitous electron donor for subsurface microorganisms. During underground hydrogen storage operations, it is expected that microbial communities will use the injected hydrogen as electron donor for diverse metabolisms, and induce a variety of microbial-triggered risks. A significant concern is the formation of biofilm and induced bioclogging, which may reduce the hydrogen injectivity and storage operation efficiency by altering the subsurface hydrogen flow. This study investigates how different electron donors─specifically hydrogen and lactate─affect the growth dynamics of a sulfate-reducing bacterium (Oleidesulfovibrio alaskensis G20) and the associated biofilm formation in porous media. The pore-scale observations reveal that lactate promotes robust biofilms resulting in bioclogging, compared to hydrogen promoting increased microbial motility with less biomass production. Potential hydrogen chemotaxis leads to biofilm dispersal and detachment over time as the cells seemingly favor a planktonic lifestyle over biofilm formation. Multiple hydrogen injections enhanced biofilm detachment and reduced the risk of pore blockage associated with microbial growth. Three hydrogen injections resulted in 69% biofilm detachment, while nitrogen injection caused only 31% detachment over three cycles. The combination of increased cell motility and reduced biofilm attachment indicates that the risk of bioclogging during cyclic UHS operation might be low for this model bacterial strain."

Tuning the electronic metal–support interaction (EMSI) is viable for promoting catalytic performances of SACs. Herein, an effective strategy of modulating the EMSI in Ru1/CeO2 SACs by thermal treatment control is proposed, which distinctly enhances the activities of the catalyst for chlorobenzene (CB) oxidation and chlorine conversion, accomplishing total CB degradation at nearly 260 °C. Detailed characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that the EMSI induces electron transfer from Ru to CeO2, optimizing the coordination and electronic structure of single-atom Ru and accordingly facilitating the adsorption and activation of CB. Moreover, the surface lattice oxygen (Olatt) at the Ru–O–Ce interface is demonstrated as the critical reactive oxygen species, the mobility and reactivity of which are also prompted by the EMSI, leading to the boosted conversion of reaction intermediates. This work sheds light on the effect of EMSI regulation on CVOC catalytic oxidation and provides guidance on fabricating high-efficiency SACs for environmental catalysis."

However, our understanding of insect nAChR pharmacology and the specific nAChR subunits targeted by these insecticides remains limited. Here, we cloned 11 nAChR subunit genes, comprising Nlα1 to Nlα8, Nlα10, Nlβ1 and Nlβ3, from Nilaparvata lugens, a highly damaging insect pest of rice crops worldwide. Analysis of the expression of these genes in different tissues of N. lugens by qPCR analysis identified the brain as the primary site of expression. Knock down of the expression of Nlα1, Nlα2, Nlα8 and Nlβ1 using RNAi reduced N. lugens sensitivity to triflumezopyrim, suggesting these genes encode potential target subunits for triflumezopyrim. Knock out of Nlα2 and Nlα8 nAChR subunits by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing showed that their deletion significantly reduced the toxicity of triflumezopyrim toward N. lugens. Furthermore, the deletion of Nlα2 also increased N. lugens resistance to imidacloprid and dinotefuran. However, numerous attempts revealed that the Nlβ1 knockout was nonviable. In vitro expression of receptors composed of Drosophila homologous subunits showed that this all-insect nAChR was inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of triflumezopyrim. The present findings identify specific nAChR subunits that are important both as targets for monitoring resistance-associated mutations and as subjects for molecular studies aimed at developing novel insecticides targeting these essential ion channels."

Ward,Similar Oxygen Sensitivities of Different Steps of Denitrification in Estuarine Waters,"Hypoxia is observed and projected to expand in many aquatic environments, largely due to excess anthropogenic nutrient inputs and climate change, thus influencing biogeochemical processes. Denitrification, generally an anaerobic process, removes bioavailable nitrogen and produces nitrous oxide (N2O). However, limited observations of the effect of oxygen on denitrification restrict our ability to estimate changes in the amount of bioavailable nitrogen and N2O emissions under anthropogenic perturbations and climate change. Here, we show that all denitrification steps increased, while the N2O production yield from denitrification decreased with decreasing oxygen in Chesapeake Bay – the largest estuary in the United States. The different steps of denitrification responded similarly to oxygen changes in Chesapeake Bay, unlike open ocean oxygen minimum zones, with implications for the accumulation or depletion of denitrification intermediates such as nitrite and N2O. Our observations also suggest that current model parametrizations of denitrification in Chesapeake Bay likely overestimate denitrification and nitrogen removal in the presence of oxygen, which would bias the evaluation of nutrient cycling, ecosystem productivity, and the extent of hypoxia. Overall, our newly derived oxygen sensitivities of denitrification could be used to improve model parametrizations of denitrification and constrain the nitrogen budget and N2O emissions in estuarine and coastal environments experiencing hypoxia."

However, gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM) characteristics remain debated due to limitations in the commonly used KCl-coated denuder method. Here, we reassess GOM characteristics by simultaneously employing both the denuder method and a more reliable dual-channel method with a cation exchange membrane in an integrated system (CSAMS). Based on year-long observations in urban Beijing, we found significantly distinct seasonal patterns of GOM concentrations when using different methods: the denuder method showed GOM peaks in spring and troughs in summer, while the dual-channel method recorded the highest in summer and the lowest in winter. These  results indicated significant seasonal variability in method consistency (the ratio of denuder GOM to dual-channel GOM), with values ranging from 7.3% in summer to 18.7% in spring (p-value < 0.05). Using a generalized additive model, we quantified the impacts of different environmental variables on method consistency. GOM, particulate-bound mercury, relative humidity, ozone, and nitric acid were identified as the main factors. Our study suggests temporal and potential spatial biases in GOM measurement introduced by the denuder method.

Since 2005, Campi Flegrei caldera (Italy) has experienced accelerating ground uplift, seismicity rates, and degassing. Here we conduct petrological and 4D X‐ray microtomography investigations on cored rocks from a ∼3 km deep geothermal well located near the center of caldera, complemented by 3D high‐resolution seismic tomography. At a depth of ∼2.5–3.0 km we identify the transition to a weak tuff layer likely to trap magmatic fluids. Simulations of magma pathways indicate that stresses generated by caldera unloading may have arrested at the limestone/tuff transition past ascending dykes, which deformed, heated, and released magmatic fluids, deteriorating the surrounding rocks. This weak layer may play a crucial role in building up overpressure, causing deformation and seismicity, thus influencing the dynamics of recent unrests, and possible future magma ascent episodes."

 Pyrazoles are heterocycles commonly found as key substructures in agrochemicals and medicinally active compounds alike.1,2 Despite their pervasiveness, established methods fall notably short in delivering complex pyrazoles selectively due to issues of differentiation during either assembly or N-functionalization.3 This is a direct consequence of a dominant synthetic strategy that attempts to control selectivity-determining bonds between poorly differentiated starting materials. To overcome this longstanding challenge, we here describe a prototypical example of an alternative conceptual approach, “Strategic Atom Replacement”, in which we synthesize N-alkyl pyrazoles from isothiazoles. The net forward transformation is a “swap” of the isothiazole sulfur atom with a nitrogen atom and its associated alkyl fragment to deliver the alkylated pyrazole.4,5 Linking the two azoles is an orphaned heterocycle class, 1,2,3-Thiadiazine-S-Oxides, whose synthetic potential has yet to be tapped.6 By proceeding via these unusual heterocycles, the typical selectivity and separation challenges associated with exclusively bond-based pyrazole preparations are circumvented, and even minimally differentiated peripheral substituents can be discriminated to afford isomerically pure products."

Zhu,Hidden states and dynamics of fractional fillings in twisted MoTe<sub>2</sub> bilayers,"Hidden states and dynamics of fractional fillings in twisted MoTe<sub>2</sub> bilayers 
 The fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect was recently discovered in twisted MoTe2 bilayers (tMoTe2)1–4. Experiments to date have revealed Chern insulators from hole doping at ν = -1, -2/3, -3/5, and -4/7 (per moiré unit cell) 1–6. In parallel, theories predict that, between v = -1 and -3, there exist exotic quantum phases 7–15, such as the coveted fractional topological insulators (FTI), fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) states, and non-abelian fractional states. Here we employ transient optical spectroscopy 16,17 on tMoTe2 to reveal nearly 20 hidden states at fractional fillings that are absent in static optical sensing or transport measurements. A pump pulse selectively excites charge across the correlated or pseudo gaps, leading to the disordering (melting) of correlated states 18. A probe pulse detects the subsequent melting and recovery dynamics via exciton and trion sensing 1,3,19–21. Besides the known states, we observe additional fractional fillings between ν = 0 and -1 and a large number of states on the electron doping side (ν > 0). Most importantly, we observe new states at fractional fillings of the Chern bands at ν = -4/3, -3/2, -5/3, -7/3, -5/2, and -8/3. These states are potential candidates for the predicted exotic topological phases 7–15. Moreover, we show that melting of correlated states occurs on two distinct time scales, 2-4 ps and 180-270 ps, attributed to electronic and phonon mechanisms, respectively. We discuss the differing dynamics of the electron and hole doped states from the distinct moiré conduction and valence bands."

 Acoustic oscillations in stars are sensitive to stellar interiors1. Frequency differences between overtone modes—large separations—probe stellar density2, whereas differences between low-degree modes—small separations—probe the sound-speed gradient in the energy-generating core of main-sequence Sun-like stars3, and hence their ages. At later phases of stellar evolution, characterized by inert cores, small separations are believed to lose much of their power to probe deep interiors and become proportional to large separations4,5. Here we present evidence of a rapidly evolving convective zone as stars evolve from the subgiant phase into red giants. By measuring acoustic oscillations in 27 stars from the open cluster M67, we observe deviations of proportionality between small and large separations, which are caused by the influence of the bottom of the convective envelope. These deviations become apparent as the convective envelope penetrates deep into the star during subgiant and red giant evolutions, eventually entering an ultradeep regime that leads to the red-giant-branch luminosity bump. The tight sequence of cluster stars, free of large spreads in ages and fundamental properties, is essential for revealing the connection between the observed small separations and the chemical discontinuities occurring at the bottom of the convective envelope. We use this sequence to show that combining large and small separations can improve estimations of the masses and ages of field stars well after the main sequence.

 Although it is one of the most arid regions today, the Sahara Desert was a green savannah during the African Humid Period (AHP) between 14,500 and 5,000 years before present, with water bodies promoting human occupation and the spread of pastoralism in the middle Holocene epoch1. DNA rarely preserves well in this region, limiting knowledge of the Sahara’s genetic history and demographic past. Here we report ancient genomic data from the Central Sahara, obtained from two approximately 7,000-year-old Pastoral Neolithic female individuals buried in the Takarkori rock shelter in southwestern Libya. The majority of Takarkori individuals’ ancestry stems from a previously unknown North African genetic lineage that diverged from sub-Saharan African lineages around the same time as present-day humans outside Africa and remained isolated throughout most of its existence. Both Takarkori individuals are closely related to ancestry first documented in 15,000-year-old foragers from Taforalt Cave, Morocco2, associated with the Iberomaurusian lithic industry and predating the AHP. Takarkori and Iberomaurusian-associated individuals are equally distantly related to sub-Saharan lineages, suggesting limited gene flow from sub-Saharan to Northern Africa during the AHP. In contrast to Taforalt individuals, who have half the Neanderthal admixture of non-Africans, Takarkori shows ten times less Neanderthal ancestry than Levantine farmers, yet significantly more than contemporary sub-Saharan genomes. Our findings suggest that pastoralism spread through cultural diffusion into a deeply divergent, isolated North African lineage that had probably been widespread in Northern Africa during the late Pleistocene epoch. Pastoralism spread through cultural diffusion into the Green Sahara, where an isolated, distinct North African ancestry persisted."

 Anion doping offers immense potential for tailoring material properties, but precise control over anion incorporation remains challenging due to complex synthesis and limitations in dopant detection. This study investigates F-ion intercalation within an infinite-layer NdNiO2+x/SrTiO3 superlattice using a two-step process. We employ advanced four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) coupled with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) to map the F distribution and its impact on the atomic and electronic structure. Our observations reveal a fluorination-induced geometric reconstruction of the infinite layer structure, resulting in a more distorted orthorhombic phase compared to the pristine perovskite. F-ion are primarily located at apical polyhedral sites, with some basal sites occupation in localized regions, leading to the formation of two distinct domains. These domains reflect a competition between polyhedral distortion and Nd displacement at domain interfaces. Interestingly, we observe an anomalous structural distortion where basal site anions are displaced in the same direction as Nd atoms, potentially linked to the partial basal site F-ion occupation. This coexistence of diverse structural distortions signifies a locally disordered F-ion distribution with distinct configurations. These findings provide crucial insights into the mechanisms of anion doping at the atomic level, contributing to the design of materials with tailored functionalities.

 The UniProt database is a valuable resource for biocatalyst discovery, yet predicting enzymatic functions remains challenging, especially for low-similarity sequences. Identifying superior enzymes with enhanced catalytic properties is even harder. To overcome these challenges, we develop ESM-Ezy, an enzyme mining strategy leveraging the ESM-1b protein language model and similarity calculations in semantic space. Using ESM-Ezy, we identify novel multicopper oxidases (MCOs) with superior catalytic properties, achieving a 44% success rate in outperforming query enzymes (QEs) in at least one property, including catalytic efficiency, heat and organic solvent tolerance, and pH stability. Notably, 51% of the MCOs excel in environmental remediation applications, and some exhibited unique structural motifs and unique active centers enhancing their functions. Beyond MCOs, 40% of L-asparaginases identified show higher specific activity and catalytic efficiency than QEs. ESM-Ezy thus provides a promising approach for discovering high-performance biocatalysts with low sequence similarity, accelerating enzyme discovery for industrial applications.

 The genesis of kimberlites is unclear despite the economic and scientific interest surrounding these diamond-bearing magmas. One critical question is whether they tap ancient, deep mantle domains or the shallow convecting mantle with partial melting triggered by plumes or plate tectonics. To address this question, we report the He-Ne-Ar isotopic compositions of magmatic fluids trapped in olivine from kimberlites worldwide. The kimberlites which have been least affected by addition of deeply subducted or metasomatic components have Ne isotopes less nucleogenic than the upper mantle, hence requiring a deep-mantle origin. This is corroborated by previous evidence of small negative W isotope anomalies and kimberlite location along age-progressive hot-spot tracks. The lack of strong primordial He isotope signatures indicates overprinting by lithospheric and crustal components, which suggests that Ne isotopes are more robust tracers of deep-mantle contributions in intraplate continental magmas. The most geochemically depleted kimberlites may preserve deep remnants of early-Earth heterogeneities.

 Longitudinal multi-view omics data offer unique insights into the temporal dynamics of individual-level physiology, which provides opportunities to advance personalized healthcare. However, the common occurrence of incomplete views makes extrapolation tasks difficult, and there is a lack of tailored methods for this critical issue. Here, we introduce LEOPARD, an innovative approach specifically designed to complete missing views in multi-timepoint omics data. By disentangling longitudinal omics data into content and temporal representations, LEOPARD transfers the temporal knowledge to the omics-specific content, thereby completing missing views. The effectiveness of LEOPARD is validated on four real-world omics datasets constructed with data from the MGH COVID study and the KORA cohort, spanning periods from 3 days to 14 years. Compared to conventional imputation methods, such as missForest, PMM, GLMM, and cGAN, LEOPARD yields the most robust results across the benchmark datasets. LEOPARD-imputed data also achieve the highest agreement with observed data in our analyses for age-associated metabolites detection, estimated glomerular filtration rate-associated proteins identification, and chronic kidney disease prediction. Our work takes the first step toward a generalized treatment of missing views in longitudinal omics data, enabling comprehensive exploration of temporal dynamics and providing valuable insights into personalized healthcare.

 The rapid growth of biomedical literature poses challenges for manual knowledge curation and synthesis. Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP) automates the process. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in general domains, their effectiveness in BioNLP tasks remains unclear due to limited benchmarks and practical guidelines. We perform a systematic evaluation of four LLMs—GPT and LLaMA representatives—on 12 BioNLP benchmarks across six applications. We compare their zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning performance with the traditional fine-tuning of BERT or BART models. We examine inconsistencies, missing information, hallucinations, and perform cost analysis. Here, we show that traditional fine-tuning outperforms zero- or few-shot LLMs in most tasks. However, closed-source LLMs like GPT-4 excel in reasoning-related tasks such as medical question answering. Open-source LLMs still require fine-tuning to close performance gaps.

Here, authors report tailoring the pore chemistry of framework polymer membranes, which alters the interaction between Cl- and membranes and speeds Cl- transport, improving flow battery performance. 
 Studying ion transport in the interaction confinement regime has important implications for membrane design and advanced electrochemical devices. A key example is the rapid-charging capability of aqueous organic redox flow batteries, enabled by near-frictionless Na+/K+ transport within triazine framework membranes. However, achieving similar breakthroughs for devices using anions (e.g., Cl-) is challenging due to the suppression of anion transport under confinement, known as the charge asymmetry effect. We present a series of anion-selective covalent triazine framework membranes with comparable densities of subnanometer ion transport channels and identical micropore size distributions, which help to overcome the charge asymmetry effect and promote fast anion conduction. We demonstrate that regulating the charge distribution in the membrane frameworks reduces the energy barrier for anion transport, resulting in nearly doubled Cl- conductivity and adding almost no additional energy barrier for F- transport. This membrane enables an aqueous organic redox flow battery using Cl- ions to operate at high current densities, exceeding battery performance demonstrated by current membranes. These findings could benefit various electrochemical devices and inspire single-species selectivity in separation membranes. The suppressed Cl- transport under micropore confinement is a critical challenge.

 Particle exchange heat engines are a novel class of cyclic heat engines that are all-electrical, contain no moving parts and can therefore be scaled down to nanometer size. At the center of their operation is the manipulation of a particle flow between a hot and a cold reservoir through energy filtering mechanisms, where their efficiency depends primarily on the sharpness of the energy filter. In this study, we investigate the efficiency enhancement of such engines by utilizing ultra-sharp transmission resonances formed by magnetic impurities interacting with superconductors, known as Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states. To this end, we couple a neutral and stable diradical molecule to superconducting break-junction electrodes, and study its thermoelectric properties at ultra-low temperatures. By driving the molecular heat engine through a phase transition from a Kondo state into the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov regime, we observe a five fold increase in the thermoelectric power factor. This observation could pave the way for practical applications such as cryogenic waste heat recovery and efficient spot-cooling for future quantum computing architectures.

 The dissolution of polymer crystals often proceeds at rates varying in time and space. Here, using low molecular weight poly(ethylene oxide) as a model polymer, we exploit step-wise selective dissolution for unveiling how spatial variations in metastability are generated during the growth of lamellar polymer single crystals. The dissolution velocity along defined crystal faces is constant, but ca. 5 times faster for rough than for smooth faces. From the temperature dependence of dissolution, we derive detachment energies of 420 ± 40 kJ/mol and 650 ± 50 kJ/mol for rough and smooth faces, respectively, suggesting that on a rough face polymer chains have ca. 1/3 less neighboring molecules to interact with. The observed high values of the activation energy indicate that, for dissolving a polymer crystal, the progressive detachment of whole chains is indispensable.

 Recycling large quantities of lithium-ion batteries facing retirement is pivotal for resource conservation and environmental sustainability. Direct recycling, while offering a promising avenue with reduced waste compared with pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy, often involves intricate and long processes. Here we introduce a water electrolysis-induced separation approach, using H2 or O2 gas bubbling to efficiently separate electrode materials from current collectors. The process achieves 99.5% materials recovery with metal impurities <40 ppm within 34 s for LiFePO4 and 3 s for graphite at 10 mA cm−2, with minimal energy consumption of 11 and 1.1 kJ kgcell−1. Moreover, this approach accommodates various electrode types, encompassing cathodes and anodes from spent batteries or manufacturing scraps. The subsequent dry electrode manufacturing process with lithium replenishment substantially enhances environmental sustainability by eliminating the use of N-methyl pyrrolidone, while maintaining performance through the effective mixing of active materials and conductive agents. An EverBatt analysis underscores a remarkable reduction in energy consumption and waste generation compared with industrially adopted recycling methods. This finding provides an efficient and sustainable solution for battery recycling while ensuring high-quality materials production. Current battery recycling processes face sustainability challenges.

 Turbulent air motions determine the local environment in which cloud ice crystals form. Homogeneous freezing of aqueous solution droplets is the most fundamental pathway to nucleate ice crystals in cirrus. Lack of knowledge about the role of turbulence in cirrus ice formation limits our understanding of how uncertainties in small-scale cloud processes affect the climatological radiative effect of cirrus. Here we shed first light on how turbulent fluctuations in temperature and supersaturation interact with probabilistic homogeneous freezing. We show that spatial model resolution substantially below 1–10 m is needed to properly simulate homogeneous freezing events. Importantly, microscale turbulence generates large variability in nucleated ice crystal number concentrations. Previous research ascribed this variability to mesoscale dynamical forcing due to gravity waves alone. The turbulence-generated microphysical variability has macrophysical implications. The wide range of predicted cloud radiative heating anomalies in anvil cirrus due to turbulence-ice nucleation interactions, comparable to typical mean values, is potentially large enough to affect the response of tropical cirrus cloud systems to global warming. Our results have ramifications for the multiscale modeling of cirrus clouds and the interpretation of in situ measurements."

 To achieve the Paris climate agreement goals, methane (CH4) emission mitigation plays a key role. Therefore, a better understanding of the global methane cycle is indispensable. Here we simulate the global methane cycle fully interactively from 1850 to 2100 with a strong mitigation action scenario (SSP1-2.6) post 2014. We show that the atmospheric methane burden largely recovers to early 20th-century levels, while wetland methane emissions follow a persistent upward trend from 166 Tg(CH4) yr–1 at pre-industrial to 221 Tg(CH4) yr–1 in 2100. The methane lifetime decreases from 9.3 to 7.3 years over the 1850–2100 period. We identify net primary productivity as the main driver behind the wetland methane trend with R2 = 0.7. This implies that important components of the methane cycle (wetland methane, methane lifetime) are subject to Earth system feedbacks, potentially impacting any prospective methane mitigation action.

Particularly, the high TC activity in summer 2018 was well predicted. We found that the 2018 positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) contributed to the predictability by the dynamical prediction system: suppressed convection in the eastern tropical Indian Ocean enhanced divergent wind from the eastern tropical Indian Ocean to the Okinawa and Taiwan areas. This helped to generate low pressure in the target area, which was favorable to the TC activity.

 The production of olive oil, a cornerstone of Mediterranean diet, faces important threats from recurring droughts and the anticipated decline in cyclical solar activity. These escalating challenges cast uncertainty on the long-term sustainability of olive-growing regions. Here we draw on 8000 years of olive pollen data - closely related to flowering, fertilization and fruit production - to identify the key long-term determinants influencing olive yields. Our findings indicate that pollen production, and therefore yields, are primarily driven by photosynthesis, which is influenced not only by temperature and CO2 levels, but also by precipitation during olive phenological stages and changes in the radiation balance, rather than by variations in solar energy alone. Changes in photosynthetic activity emerge as a critical determinant of the future of the Mediterranean olive oil economy and have major implications for food security in the region.

 Warming temperatures have been invoked as a potential mechanism for widespread change to the erosional regime in Arctic regions, where large portions of watersheds are underlain by permanently frozen soils. Yet recent site-specific studies have delivered conflicting results regarding how erosion along Arctic rivers has responded to past temperature increase, and how erosion will respond to rising temperatures in the future. Here we use 92,009 observations of fluvial erosion across 13,400 stream kilometers in the Mackenzie River watershed to show that erosion rates along rivers across the Canadian Arctic are positively correlated to temperature and uncorrelated with vegetative cover over the satellite record (1985-present). While temperature’s erosive effect appears to be mediated by discharge, our results nevertheless suggest warming will lead to increased erosion in the Arctic but that the enhanced erosive regime may be less dramatic than earlier predictions.

 National energy system models play a crucial role in climate policy. However, they often overlook environmental impacts beyond territorial greenhouse gas emissions. Here we evaluate a territorial net-zero carbon dioxide emissions energy scenario for Switzerland coupled with life cycle assessment to quantify non-domestic environmental burdens. We highlight the limitations of considering only territorial emissions. Indeed, even if domestic greenhouse gas emissions are reduced to net zero by 2050, 2 to 5 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year persist abroad due to imports and energy-related infrastructure. These extra-territorial emissions are influenced by global climate policies. Additionally, broadening the scope of environmental indicators is crucial as more countries pursue net-zero goals. Our findings highlight trade-offs, showing how environmental impacts other than those on climate change (ecosystem impacts, air pollution, natural resource use) could increase and shift beyond Switzerland as the country electrifies its economy.

 Climate models project reduced temperature variability in Northern high latitudes due to global warming, but impacts on mid-latitude variability remain uncertain. Here, using multi-model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, we find that daily winter temperature variability increases across the Eurasian mid-latitudes under future warming. This variability strongly correlates with the North Atlantic sea surface temperature gradient, characterized by a warm tropics–cold high-latitude sea surface temperature pattern linked to a weakened Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Idealized simulations using a climate model confirm that a stronger North Atlantic Sea surface temperature gradient amplifies Eurasian mid-latitude temperature variability by enhancing the meridional temperature gradient. Additional simulations show that warming in the tropical Indian Ocean-western Pacific warm pool has a weaker effect on Eurasian temperature variability than the North Atlantic sea surface temperature gradient. These findings suggest that Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation weakening could lead to heightened winter variability in Eurasian mid-latitudes.

 Climate change is expected to alter the frequency and intensity of extreme events, modifying the natural disturbance regimes to which ecosystems are adapted.

 Foliar stable carbon isotope is an excellent indicator of plant water use efficiency, providing crucial insights into vegetation dynamics under climate change. However, in arid and semiarid grassland ecosystems, the factors driving variations in community-level foliar stable carbon isotope remain unclear. Here, we combined community-weighted mean foliar stable carbon isotope from 399 sampling sites across three grassland types in Inner Mongolia with environmental factors and leaf traits to reveal the mechanisms driving variations in community-level foliar carbon isotopes. We examined the impact of environmental factors (climate and soil factors) and leaf traits on community-level foliar stable carbon isotope. Our results show that community-level foliar stable carbon isotope variations are predominantly influenced by environmental factors in meadow and typical steppes but by leaf traits in desert steppe. These findings clarify divergent regulatory mechanisms of carbon-water balance in different grasslands, providing critical insights for predicting ecosystem responses to environmental changes.

 Biological nitrogen fixation is an important source of new nitrogen, influencing ocean fertility and carbon uptake. While recently documented in Arctic waters, its role in the Southern Ocean remains uncertain. We measured nitrogen fixation along the Western Antarctic Peninsula and at Palmer Station over two austral summer months. Rates from 15N2 assay were below conservative detection limits but detectable under less stringent detection thresholds. Continuous acetylene reduction assay provided further support. nifH gene sequencing identified Gammaproteobacteria as the dominating identified diazotrophs, while Epsilonproteobacteria contributed disproportionally to nifH expression when putative nitrogen fixation was highest. Combined with environmental observations, we hypothesize that vertical water mixing resuspended sediments into the water column and contributed to the limited nitrogen fixation. Given the sporadic and low rates, further research is needed to determine whether nitrogen fixation plays a minor role or represents an overlooked process with biogeochemical significance in the Southern Ocean.

 Global increase in the pace of climate action is urgent. Yet, it is less clear who citizens expect to take the lead on climate action across different regions of the world: historical emitters, their own governments, or themselves? Our analysis of Africa’s largest public opinion survey, the Afrobarometer, across 39 countries finds that Africans place primary responsibility for addressing climate change on their own government, a further third see ordinary citizens as most responsible, while very few place responsibility on historical emitters. Multinomial logistic regression analysis shows that education, decreased poverty, and access to new media sources are associated with increased attribution of responsibility to historical emitters. Our results suggest that poverty alleviation and increased access to education, combined with professional frontline government bureaucracies can re-apportion citizen expectations of responsibility for climate action onto historical emitters and actors with more resources for scalable climate action.

 Current space-borne L-band radiometers have been routinely providing global soil moisture maps every 2 to 3 days for more than 15 years. However, they can only estimate soil moisture in the top 5 cm of the soil, which limits its usefulness in applications that need deep layer soil moisture. Fortuitously, recent work has shown that there is a potential to retrieve root zone soil moisture (RZSM) when combining P-band radiometer data with L-band radiometer data at the same spatial resolution. Nevertheless, there are antenna size limitations that currently restrict L-band radiometer data to a resolution of 40 km. Accordingly, if the same antenna is used for a joint P-band (750 MHz) and L-band (1.4GHz) satellite mission, the footprint size at P-band will be double that attained at L-band, limiting its usefulness in applications and making joint interpretation difficult. It is therefore essential to downscale the P-band radiometer measurements to at least the same resolution as the L-band measurements. Consequently, this paper has explored three alternative passive-passive P-band downscaling algorithms using the spatial information that exists in the L-band radiometer data, to achieve P-band brightness temperature (Tb) information at the same resolution as the L-band passive measurements. Analysis was conducted using data from three airborne campaigns in south-eastern Australia, with resolutions ranging from 36 km to 200 m under a range of moisture conditions and spatial characteristics. The three alternate downscaling algorithms used in this paper, designated as Algorithm A, B, and C, were not only compared to determine which generated the best performance, but were also analysed according to different land cover types and seasons. The results demonstrated that the Smoothing Filter-based Intensity Modulation (SFIM) method, referred to as Algorithm A, outperformed the others, with a median root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the original observations of 3 K when downscaling to half of the original spatial resolution, increasing to around 8 K when downscaling to 36 times finer than the original resolution."

 Advancements in geostationary satellites allow monitoring of terrestrial photosynthesis at sub-daily scales, offering unprecedented opportunities for understanding vegetation productivity. However, at short temporal scales, photosynthesis is highly influenced by illumination conditions, particularly diffuse radiation (Ddif). Existing empirical models often overlook Ddif's impact, leading to uncertainties in hourly gross primary productivity (GPP) mapping. We determined that incorporating Ddif effects into GPP modeling improves clear-sky GPP mapping using Himawari-8. We employed a light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) considering Ddif and compared it with other empirical models: parametric, regression, and machine learning. The LGBM outperformed others, achieving an R2 of 0.8146 and root mean square error of 2.848 μmol CO₂/m2/s against ground observations from 2020 to 2021. To investigate input variable contributions in LGBM predictions, we performed SHapely Additive exPlanation (SHAP) analysis. Results confirmed that aerosol optical depth (AOD) had a greater impact during morning and evening when Ddif influence increased due to solar path length. Hourly GPP maps over East Asia from 2020 to 2021 using the LGBM demonstrated that diurnal patterns differ by landcover, with variations observed in latitudinal profiles. This underscores the need to examine GPP spatial distribution at high frequency. We confirmed that the spatial distribution of AOD SHAP values varied over time, highlighting temporal dynamics of aerosol effects. Our findings demonstrate the necessity of GPP mapping using geostationary satellites and suggest various impact studies can use our proposed framework. This approach provides a valuable tool for understanding vegetation's rapid response to atmospheric aerosols, contributing to more accurate ecosystem flux modeling."

 Iron tailings are crystalline powders predominantly composed of iron (Fe) and silicon dioxide (SiO2). Spatially characterizing the physical and chemical properties of iron tailings is greatly important for optimal utilization and proper disposal of tailings. Visible-near infrared-shortwave infrared (VIS-NIR-SWIR; 350–2500 nm) spectroscopy offers a rapid, non-destructive, and cost-effective method for quantitatively analyzing tailings properties. This study aimed to quantify and map the spatial distribution of total Fe (TFe) and SiO2 contents of tailings dams at the largest iron cluster in China using laboratory spectra and GF-5 hyperspectral images. A total of 230 samples were collected from the surface of 11 tailings dams and scanned by a VIS–NIR–SWIR reflectance spectrometer in the laboratory. A novel spectral index was developed through a multi-objective programming methodology. This novel index utilizes band ratios to identify the optimal combination of spectral bands that show a strong correlation with concentrations of TFe and SiO2. Simultaneously, it minimizes the impact of moisture content and particle size variations in surface tailings. In addition, the partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest (RF) and convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms based on laboratory spectra were used to calibrate spectral information with associated tailing properties. The contribution of wavelength in the calibration modeling process by calculating SHaply Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values. According to the results, the reflectance spectra were negatively correlated to TFe content and positively correlated to SiO2 content. The three-band spectral index (TBI) calculated by R827/(R900 × R2200) correlated best to TFe with the correlation coefficient (r) of 0.87, while the R2397/(R776×R900) correlated best to SiO2 with r of 0.70. It also minimized the effect of particle size and moisture content on the reflectance spectra of tailings properties. The CNN algorithm with laboratory spectra yielded the highest estimation accuracy for TFe (R2 = 0.74, RPD = 1.79, RMSE = 3.69 %, LCCC = 0.74 and bias = -0.41) and SiO2 (R2 = 0.81, RPD = 2.15, RMSE = 1.28 %, LCCC = 0.86 and bias = −0.49). The direct standardization (DS) algorithm was applied to correct GF-5 hyperspectral image. Subsequently, the ability of TBI and the CNN model was compared for estimating and mapping the spatial distribution of TFe and SiO2 contents based on the corrected GF-5 images. The SHAP could obtain the wavelength contribution of the CNN model in tailings spectral modeling. It can be concluded that the proposed TBI is able to rapidly characterize the spatial distribution of tailings properties, and the interpretable CNN model can provide a technical mean for accurate estimation of tailings properties based on laboratory spectra."

 In this study, a global Lagrangian chemistry-transport model, STOCHEM-CRI, was employed to study the formation of hydrogen (H2) from the oxidation of twenty anthropogenic and natural biogenic non-methane volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The base case STOCHEM-CRI model was perturbed by applying a step-change to the emissions of each VOC in turn. Differences between each perturbed case and the base case were used to derive the responses in the fluxes through the formaldehyde photolysis source of H2 and in the oxidation rate of each VOC. H2 yields were largest for the natural biogenic VOCs: isoprene, α- and β-pinene and least, close to zero, for ethyne and benzene. Differences in yields were driven by the number of carbon atoms, by the chemical mechanisms of the hydroxyl radical and ozone reactions and by the involvement of long-lived oxidation products. These responses were then used to estimate the global H2 source strengths from the oxidation of anthropogenic and natural biogenic VOCs. Ethene oxidation dominated the global H2 source from the oxidation of anthropogenic VOCs, totalling 1.6 Tg yr−1. Isoprene oxidation dominated the natural biogenic VOC oxidation source, totalling 20 Tg yr−1, over ten times higher than the anthropogenic source. Uncertainties in the VOC oxidation source of H2 make a considerable contribution to the uncertainties in the global warming potentials for H2 estimated with current chemistry-transport models."

 This study investigates the influence of the summer Victoria Mode (VM) in the North Pacific on autumn precipitation over the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) between 1980 and 2010. The results show a statistically significant negative correlation between the summer VM (June–August: JJA) and autumn rainfall (August–October: ASO) in the GMS, which is independent of the effects of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) from the preceding winter. The positive phase of the summer VM leads to reduced autumn rainfall in key areas such as Yunnan Province, southern Myanmar, western and central Thailand, and central and southern Cambodia. Here we explored the dynamic mechanisms that link the summer VM to GMS rainfall, and identified three primary pathways: (1) the modulation of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies and the development of a cyclonic circulation over the South China Sea, which reduces moisture transport to the GMS; (2) induced low-level divergence over the GMS, which suppresses ascending air motion; and (3) the propagation of a Rossby wave train that influences geopotential height anomalies and upper-level convergence around the GMS. These findings enhance our understanding of extratropical influences on autumn precipitation in the GMS and suggest that the summer VM could serve as a valuable predictor for seasonal rainfall forecasts, thereby assisting disaster prevention and mitigation efforts."

 This study identified two distinct categories of subseasonal precipitation events (SPEs) over the middle and low reaches of the Yangtze River Valley (MLYRV) during boreal summer based on the wet-dry rapid transition (WDRT) phenomenon, namely: subseasonal WDRT precipitation events (SRTPEs) and non-WDRT precipitation event (SNPEs). Although after cessations of these two events, area-averaged negative intraseasonal precipitation anomalies over the MLYRV both reach their peaks at pentad 2, the amplitude is greater for SRTPEs, in contrast to SNPEs. In conjunction with the stronger negative precipitation anomaly, the intensity of the anomalous descending motion at 500 hPa and the moisture flux divergence anomaly at 700 hPa averaged over the MLYRV are larger for SRTPEs. Furthermore, observational and model results reveal that the boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation (BSISO) activities over the western North Pacific (WNP) are more vigorous for SRTPEs and the BSISO variations serve as a pivotal origin for discrepancies in these two dynamic factors at pentad 2 through the linear dry dynamic process. In order to elucidate underlying mechanisms of the area-averaged BSISO convection change, moisture budget and multi-scale interaction diagnoses are conducted and results underscore the crucial role of the difference in regionally averaged vertical gradient of low-frequency background moisture over the WNP in driving such BSISO convection variation. Additionally, some individual cases of SRTPEs and SNPEs are also examined. These discoveries provide us with a novel perspective to comprehend diversities of SPEs over the MLYRV and may contribute potentially to the subseasonal forecasting for this region."

 As a major source of atmospheric pollution, the spatiotemporal evolution patterns and influencing factors of PM2.5 are crucial for the regulation of air quality. The Loess Plateau, a vital ecological barrier in China, is a transitional zone for northwest dust transport and eastern industrial pollution, making its environmental issues particularly significant. With its fragile ecosystem, PM2.5 pollution not only degrades air quality but may also exacerbate soil erosion and ecological degradation. Understanding PM2.5 distribution patterns is essential for formulating regional ecological protection strategies and promoting sustainable development. However, research on the spatiotemporal distribution and influencing factors of air pollutants in this region remains limited. This study analyzed PM2.5 vector data from 2010 to 2020 to explore its spatiotemporal characteristics and influencing factors. Results indicate that the annual mean PM2.5 concentration decreased during this period, from 44.570 μg·m−3 in 2010 to 30.207 μg·m−3 in 2020, a decrease of 32.25 %. In terms of spatial distribution, the PM2.5 concentration shows a pattern of ‘high in the southeast and low in the northwest’, with hotspots mainly concentrated in the provinces of Henan, Shanxi, and Shaanxi, and cold spots in Inner Mongolia and Qinghai. Through geodetectors and correlation analyses, it was found that natural factors (e.g., altitude, temperature, and precipitation) had a significantly greater influence on PM2.5 concentrations than socioeconomic factors. In particular, elevation (DEM) had the strongest explanatory power for PM2.5 concentrations and was significantly negatively correlated with PM2.5 concentrations. It was also found that PM2.5 concentrations were significantly higher in winter than in other seasons, mainly due to low winter temperatures, inversions, and residents' reliance on coal for heating. The airflow in Xi'an and Taiyuan mainly originated from the north-west, with 53.53 % and 58.09 %, respectively. Potential source areas for Xi'an included Guangyuan, Yuncheng, Xiangyang, and Yan'an, while Taiyuan's sources were primarily Shijiazhuang (Hebei) and Zhengzhou (Henan). Overall, the control of PM2.5 pollution in the Loess Plateau has achieved remarkable results, but interregional synergistic management and ecological protection still need to be strengthened in the future."

The reversible interfacial protonation reaction mechanism is revealed in situ at the single-bond level based on this interfacial state.

Following and ongoing investigations of reversed Cherenkov radiation considered it impossible to occur from a homogeneous isotropic slab with a positive refractive index. Here, we break this long-held belief by finding the emergence of reversed Cherenkov radiation from a positive-index isotropic slab by exploiting optical gain. We find precise conditions under which the backward-propagating Cherenkov radiation is maintained while the forward-propagating one is suppressed. Counterintuitively, the intensity and the angular spread of reversed Cherenkov radiation can be made robust to the slab thickness. Under this scenario, increasing the optical gain could decrease the intensity and increase the radiation angular spread."

In health care, these models offer immense potential in generating synthetic datasets and aiding medical training. Despite these strong performances, it remains uncertain whether the image generation quality is consistent across different demographic subgroups. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of fairness in medical text-to-image diffusion models. Evaluations of the Stable Diffusion model reveal substantial disparities across gender, race, and ethnicity. To reduce these biases, we propose FairDiffusion, an equity-aware latent diffusion model that improves both image quality and the semantic alignment of clinical features. In addition, we design and curate FairGenMed, a dataset tailored for fairness studies in medical generative models. FairDiffusion is further assessed on HAM10000 (dermatoscopic images) and CheXpert (chest x-rays), demonstrating its effectiveness in diverse medical imaging modalities. Together, FairDiffusion and FairGenMed advance research in fair generative learning, promoting equitable benefits of generative AI in health care."

Early and accurate diagnosis of PD is highly desirable for therapeutic interventions but remains a substantial challenge. We developed a soft, portable intelligent keyboard leveraging magnetoelasticity to detect subtle pressure variations in keystroke dynamics by converting continuous keystrokes into high-fidelity electrical signals, thus enabling the quantitative analysis of PD motor symptoms using machine learning. Relying on a fundamental working mechanism, the intelligent keyboard demonstrates highly sensitive, intrinsically waterproof, and biocompatible properties, with the successful demonstration in a pilot study on patients with PD. To facilitate the potential continuous monitoring of PD, a customized cellphone application was developed to integrate the intelligent keyboard into a wireless platform.

Increasing saturated substitutions (sp3-hybridized carbon) at the amino center and the number of chiral centers can enrich the molecular diversity and chemical space, ultimately enhancing the success of drug development. However, the synthesis of such advanced amines is challenging due to a higher level of structural complexity and stereo-control. Here, we report a modular protocol for short de novo synthesis of bis-α-chiral amines. This protocol uses commercially available Ellman sulfinamide,tert-butanesulfinamide (tBS), as the exclusive chiral source to selectively produce all possible stereoisomers. Sequential formation of contiguous α-amino chiral carbons is achieved by chirality induction and transfer mechanisms that are both enabled bytBS, the stereoselective imine functionalization and alkyne-participated rearrangement reaction. The second step we developed is crucial for high diastereoselectivity, which is problematic in previous methods. The other coupling partners used in this protocol are abundant feedstocks, providing desirable chemical diversity in the products."

Here, we investigated the roles of pseudouridine in aminoglycoside-mediated translation inhibition by comparing the structural and functional properties of the yeast wild-type and the pseudouridine-free ribosomes. We showed that the pseudouridine-free ribosomes have decreased thermostability and high sensitivity to aminoglycosides. When presented with a model internal ribosomal entry site RNA, elongation factor eEF2, GTP (guanosine triphosphate), and sordarin, hygromycin B preferentially binds to the pseudouridine-free ribosomes during initiation by blocking eEF2 binding, stalling ribosomes in a nonrotated conformation. The structures captured hygromycin B bound at the intersubunit bridge B2a enriched with pseudouridine and a deformed codon-anticodon duplex, revealing a functional link between pseudouridine and aminoglycoside inhibition. Our results suggest that pseudouridine enhances both thermostability and conformational fitness of the ribosomes, thereby influencing their susceptibility to aminoglycosides."

Studying such scattering requires simultaneous access to ultrafast and momentum-resolved dynamics of single-particle and collective excitations, which remains an experimental challenge. Here, we present time- and momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy, and we apply it to graphite, demonstrating that large (Δq≃1.2 Å−1) photoexcited electron-hole pockets induce a renormalization of in-plane and bulk plasmons. This effect is explained by intra- and intervalley scattering processes mediated by E2gandA′1phonon modes, which we directly observe via ultrafast electron diffraction and identify via ab initio calculations. Conversely, smaller electron-hole pockets (Δq≃0.7 Å−1) result in the renormalization of in-plane plasmons, which can only be partially explained by phonon-mediated scattering and thermal expansion. Our results highlight the importance of combining momentum- and time-resolved information to elucidate electronic scattering processes."

While accurate forecasts of these events are invaluable, state-of-the-art dynamic forecasting systems have shown limited predictive capabilities. Thus, the extent to which the tropical Atlantic variability is predictable remains an open question. This study explores the potential of deep learning in this context. Using a simple convolutional neural network architecture, we show that Atlantic/Benguela Niños can be predicted up to 3 to 4 months ahead. Our model excels in forecasting peak-season events with remarkable accuracy extending lead time to 5 months. Detailed analysis reveals our model’s ability to exploit known physical precursors, such as long-wave ocean dynamics, for accurate predictions of these events.

To date, the development of high-performance nitric oxide sensors compatible to modern electronic devices remains fundamentally challenging. We report that metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with ligand spin immobilization demonstrate superior chemispintronic sensitivity and selectivity toward nitric oxide. Tetrathiafulvalene radical cations (TTF·+) within the MOF lattice considerably enhance the nitric oxide recognition via spin exchange interactions, leading to a five–order of magnitude reduction in the limit of detection (LOD), as compared to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) via carrier-doping mechanism. Record-low LOD of 0.12 parts per billion was achieved in M-TTF-spin (M = cobalt, zinc, and cadmium) MOFs, which also demonstrates exceptional selectivity over typical nitrogen oxides (NOx) and VOCs. This work opens up a distinct sensing platform for radical-like analytes through strategic design of spin-immobilized molecular functional motifs toward the spintronic device configurations."
