10.5194/essd-2025-781,True,Earth System Science Data Discussions,该论文研究的是全球海洋溶解氧的长期重建，使用了先进的机器学习技术，这与大气环境遥感技术中的海洋成分分析（如海洋观测、生物地球化学循环研究）密切相关。虽然主要关注的是海洋溶解氧，但该研究方法（如机器学习、数据融合）同样适用于大气环境遥感数据分析和监测。,"['dissolved oxygen', 'ocean', 'machine learning', 'BLENDR', 'remote sensing']",Mingyu Han;Xiaogang Xing;Yuntao Zhou,"Global Monthly Ocean Dissolved Oxygen (1960–2023) Reconstructed to 5,902 m with BLENDR, a Bayesian-Optimized Ensemble Learning Framework","We combined ship and float measurements with advanced machine learning to reconstruct monthly dissolved oxygen in the global ocean from 1960 to 2023, from the surface to 5,902 m. The results reveal a persistent loss of oxygen, strongest below the surface and in major low-oxygen zones, with recent acceleration in several ocean regions. This open dataset supports climate research and assessments of risks for marine ecosystems. 
 Oceanic oxygen levels, crucial for marine ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles, have declined significantly over the past few decades due to climate change, posing severe environmental risks. However, historical dissolved oxygen (DO) measurements, especially below 2,000 m, remain sparse, limiting comprehensive annual and seasonal analyses. Here, we introduce the BLENDR framework (Bayesian-optimized Learning and ENsemble modeling for Data Reconstruction), a Bayesian-optimized ensemble of six machine-learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Extremely Randomized Trees and Histogram-based Gradient Boosting) fused via dynamic weighting, to reconstruct global monthly DO distributions at a 1° × 1° resolution from the surface to 5,902 m from 1960 to 2023. Validation against an independent dataset demonstrated that BLENDR achieves lower errors than any individual model. Our dataset captures depth-dependent deoxygenation, with the most pronounced decline occurring between 150 and 200 m, and reveals severely accelerated oxygen loss in the Arctic Ocean and North Atlantic over the past decade. This work provides the first long-term, global monthly DO product from the ocean surface to 5,902 m. The bathypelagic DO data provided in this work is a significant contribution to deep ocean oxygen dynamics and global biogeochemical cycles."

Here, we analyzed the ground-based measurement data of O3, formaldehyde (HCHO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX) collected from 2011 to 2020 at two sites in eastern Australia, namely, Memorial Park and Springwood. Only HCHO at Memorial Park showed a statistically significant upward trend (0.19 ppb yr–1). Compared with the sea-influenced air masses, the land-influenced air masses were observed to enhance all pollutant concentrations at two sites. According to the site-specific sensitivity of the O3 to the HCHO-to-NO2 ratio (FNR), the daytime formation of the O3 at two sites was mainly in the volatile organic compound (VOC)-limited regime. When the long-term variability of NO2 was weak, HCHO, particularly from primary emissions indicated by BTX, was observed to predominantly control the monthly FNR at each site over time. Our work underscores the importance of long-term in situ measurements in interpreting ground-level O3 formation and potentially informs future O3 studies in other areas in the Southern Hemisphere."

Despite its relatively low concentrations, summertime O3 pollution has become more severe in the past decade, with increasingly frequent O3 pollution events and elevated concentrations across South China. Interestingly, 39 regional high-O3 episodes occurred under strong summer monsoon influences, which challenged the conventional view that clean air brought by the monsoon solely dilutes air pollution. The WRF-CMAQ simulations revealed that while local emissions primarily drove daytime O3 formation in South China, emissions from mainland Southeast Asia and shipping substantially contributed to average hourly O3 in South China by 4 ppbv. Unexpectedly, the Beibu Gulf acted as an O3 reservoir, where O3 and its precursors from upwind regions and ship emissions accumulated and reacted, transporting O3 to South China through southerly winds. These findings redefine the dual role of the summer monsoon, demonstrating that it can both alleviate pollution and facilitate the transboundary transport of air pollutants. Our study underscores the increasing challenge that emissions in Southeast Asia and shipping activities pose to air quality in South China, calling for transboundary cooperation to manage O3 pollution."

However, the systemic risks associated with excessive CCS deployment remain underexplored, particularly in fossil-dependent economies like China. Using a scenario-driven integrated framework coupling the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) with an input–output model, we quantitatively evaluate the implications of excessive CCS adoption in China’s power transition. Results indicate that excessive CCS deployment leads to a 14.63 petawatt-hour increase in thermal power generation by 2060, simultaneously causing a significant crowding-out of wind and solar capacity. This shift results in a 4,128 MtCO2 emission rebound by 2060, exceeding 10 Gt by 2100─around 3% of the remaining carbon budget for the 1.5 °C target. Concurrently, air pollutant emissions, including CO, NOx, and SO2 rise substantially, with CO annual emissions projected to double post-2050. Additionally, the pathway is projected to reduce employment by an additional 11 million and take up nearly a quarter of China’s annual water use by 2060. Contrary to prevailing narratives emphasizing CCS cost-efficiency, this study highlights its structural trade-offs and underscores the need for system-wide optimization frameworks and adaptive governance mechanisms to ensure long-term sustainability."

However, the dependence of the acid modification effect on the molecular structure has not yet been focused on. In this work, using MoO3-modified Pt/Al2O3 as model catalysts, and the catalytic combustion of VOCs with different molecular structure characteristics as probe reactions, it was revealed that MoO3 modification showed a dialectical effect (promotional or inhibitory) on Pt/Al2O3 catalytic activity due to the molecular structure sensitivity. Further characterizations suggested that the enhanced surface acidity and more metallic Pt sites on MoO3-modified Al2O3 would benefit the oxidation of alkanes (e.g., propane and cyclohexane) due to the alleviated alkane-O2 competitive adsorption as well as the promoted C–H activation and intermediate decomposition/desorption, while the overstrong adsorption of VOCs containing π bond (e.g., toluene and propene) on MoO3-modified Pt/Al2O3 significantly suppressed the deep oxidation process and thus resulted in an inferior reactivity. This work was the first to systematically investigate the molecular structure sensitivity of the acid modification effect on the catalytic performance of Pt catalysts, which would guide the rational design of efficient catalysts from the perspective of the molecular structure."

HFC-134a measurements mainly rely on ground-based globally distributed networks with sparse spatial coverage. Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) observes HFC-134a above 5 km globally, thus bridging observational gaps in the upper atmosphere and facilitating radiative forcing assessments. However, validation of ACE-FTS HFC-134a retrievals remains limited. Here, we evaluate the latest ACE-FTS HFC-134a retrievals using surface, aircraft, and balloon observations, with the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (CTM) as the intercomparison platform. ACE-FTS HFC-134a retrievals exhibit systematic low biases across all altitudes during 2016–2024, varying from 0.7–15.3% (10–20 km), 12.1–26.6% (below 10 km), to 7.2–22.0% (above 20 km), likely due to retrieval limitations and water vapor interference not fully addressed in the current retrieval algorithm. Interperiod comparison suggests a mean observation-model difference ranging from −12.6% to −10.9%, implying stable ACE-FTS HFC-134a retrievals over time without degradation. This study integrates available in situ measurements with a CTM to indirectly validate HFC-134a observations from space, demonstrating a valuable framework for assessing satellite retrievals of a range of other fluorinated greenhouse gases."

Here, the photodegradation of six representative SAs under 222 nm irradiation was investigated, emphasizing the roles of dissociated forms (neutral and deprotonated) and substituent structures (five-membered and six-membered heterocyclic). Results demonstrated that SAs’ photodegradation proceeded through both direct photolysis and radical-mediated self-sensitized pathways. Dissociated forms primarily influenced the kinetics and the relative contributions of dual pathways: deprotonated forms (SAs0,–) generally degraded faster than their neutral forms (SAs+,–), and they are also more prone to attack by selectively photogenerated radicals. Substituent structures dictated bond-cleavage modes in direct photolysis: five-membered ring (5R) SAs underwent O–N or S–N cleavage, while six-membered ring (6R) SAs favored SO2 extrusion. In the self-sensitized pathway, hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and superoxide radicals (O2•–) were identified as the major reactive oxygen species (ROS), with •OH exhibiting a unique dual origin from both dissolved oxygen (DO) and H2O molecules. These findings provide mechanistic insights into 222 nm far-UVC-driven SAs degradation and inform the design of efficient, mercury-free UV-based water treatment systems."

This study develops a semianalytical model to investigate transient vapor migration under varying source strengths (large-volume, diminishing, and fluctuating) and source types (groundwater and soil-gas). For large-volume sources, vertical vapor concentration profiles in soils with high moisture stabilize over 50 years, demonstrating that steady-state screening-level models may mischaracterize long-term exposure risks. The soil diffusion time scale approximates the overall time scale of the VI pathway, identifying subsurface vapor migration as the limiting process. The capillary fringe above groundwater sources slows vapor migration. For finite and diminishing sources, indoor air concentrations rise from zero to a peak value before declining back to zero. Altering the system’s influx and outflux can effectively mitigate VI risks: increasing the ratio of the building volume to the source volume shortens the peak arrival time, and increasing the air exchange rate reduces the peak indoor air concentration. For periodic sources, a highly fluctuating attenuation factor indicates that the soil diffusion time scale is comparable to or much smaller than the source period, necessitating time-dependent VI analysis for long-term exposure assessments. Conversely, steady indoor air concentrations at late times suggest that the VI time scale far exceeds the source period, and periodic sources behave similarly to large-volume sources. A linear system approach is proposed to simulate diminishing or sporadically varying source strengths and is applied to a recent VI field test under a fluctuating trichloroethylene groundwater source. The approach effectively generates continuous results from sparse field measurements, with the simulated VI pathway exhibiting patterns consistent with the transient semianalytical model."

Hamburg,Ensuring the Climate and Environmental Integrity of Alternative Fuels,"Public and private investments in alternative fuels─molecular energy carriers with potentially lower net greenhouse gas emissions than conventional fossil fuels─are rapidly expanding due to their perceived decarbonization potential. However, alternative fuels like hydrogen, ammonia, and methanol are not inherently “good” simply because they can be produced with low-carbon methods. Their climate and environmental impacts vary widely depending on how they are produced, handled, and used─factors that most assessments fail to fully account for. This can result in poorly informed decision-making, with overestimated benefits of deployment choices. In this Perspective, we highlight potential environmental impacts from alternative fuel value chains and provide an actionable guide for their responsible deployment. Specifically, we provide a brief overview of alternative fuel attributes, assess climate and air quality implications across production, handling, and use, and discuss technological, political-economic, social, and other environmental considerations for responsible deployment. We recommend improvements to alternative fuel assessments and suggest safeguards to maximize their climate and environmental integrity, including best-in-class practices and enabling policies. Given the urgency of achieving global climate goals, it is critical to ensure that scaling up of alternative fuels adheres to sustainable practices from the outset."

Here, we present an aqueous-phase nanoencapsulation strategy using natural polysaccharides to construct a mechano-responsive hydration network that ensures safe INP storage and controlled deployment. By engineering a polysaccharide-based hydration matrix, we immobilize 30 wt % INP within a noncombustible viscoelastic solid, eliminating pyrophoric risks while achieving <0.5% daily Fe(0) loss and >96% H2 evolution suppression over 60 days under practical storage and transport conditions─outperforming conventional aqueous slurry in reactivity preservation. Mechanistic studies reveal that the matrix enables dual preservation pathways: (1) microenvironment engineering via 1.1 nm hydrophilic nanoconfinement, which restricts water mobility, increases bound water phases (∼45%), and elevates Fe(0)-H2O reaction barriers by +1.56/0.93 eV; and (2) autonomous corrosion inhibition through an in situ-formed H2 coating. The mechano-responsive design facilitates on-demand liberation via shear-driven dissolution, yielding injectable suspensions with enhanced functionality (e.g., colloidal stability, subsurface mobility, and contaminant removal efficiency). Multiscale characterizations─from molecular dynamics simulations to contaminant remediation─validate the approach. This strategy secures the entire INP remediation lifecycle (storage, transport, and injection), establishing an integrated platform that synergizes fundamental water-structure manipulation with autonomously formed gas-phase shielding principles for safe, sustainable nanoremediation."

We applied an enhanced positive matrix factorization approach integrating VOC and organic aerosol measurements. This unified analysis identifies the well-documented cooking organic aerosol (COA, ∼21% of total OA) and, importantly, extracts cooking-emitted VOCs through COA constraints. The extracted VOC profile is corroborated well by direct kitchen cooking experiments. Our results show that cooking emissions constitute ∼7% of total atmospheric VOC mixing ratio. Further analysis demonstrates that cooking-emitted VOCs contribute to both secondary pollution formation and health risks. These environmental impacts have been largely overlooked in previous ambient VOC assessments due to the failure to identify cooking-emitted VOCs. These findings challenge the conventional practice of venting cooking emissions outdoors to protect indoor air quality, suggesting the necessity of an end-of-pipe treatment for cooking exhaust. This study demonstrates an advanced data-driven source apportionment strategy that directly integrates multiple data sets within a single PMF analysis. By leveraging mutual constraints among coemitted pollutants, this unified approach enhances source separation and factor interpretation through internal cross-validation without requiring prior source profiles."

The SEW and its exposure–response (E–R) relationship were assessed. Doctor-diagnosed AR prevalence was 11.9%. Average O3 exposure from prenatal to AR onset ranged from 67.5 to 76.7 μg/m3. The critical SEW was identified as infancy, specifically 30–38 weeks postnatal (7.5–9.5 months). Per interquartile range (IQR) (10.1 μg/m3) increase in O3, the adjusted odds ratio was 1.29 (95% CI: 1.22–1.36), independent of PM2.5. The E–R relationship was nonlinear, J-shaped, and threshold-free. The SEW effect was stronger in southern cities and mitigated by ≥6 months of exclusive breastfeeding. In conclusion, O3 significantly increases AR risk, with 7.5–9.5 months postnatal being a critical SEW, especially in exclusive breastfeeding <6 months and southern regions."

However, an alternative risk assessment method to prospective longitudinal studies of exposome-metabolome interactions for liver inflammation-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is lacking. This study investigates the risk of long-term real-world PM2.5 exposure in hepatocarcinogenesis through machine learning techniques. Shotgun mass spectrometry (MS) imaging data were acquired from mouse models across a continuum of fibrosis, cirrhosis, and HCC for training a multiclass classification model to identify “No Risk”, “Cancer Risk”, and “Cancer”. Direct infusion-MS data from PM2.5-exposed mouse livers were analyzed to classify risk. By integrating data-driven and knowledge-based approaches, 14 disease progression biomarkers were identified for modeling. Our results suggest that chronic real-world PM2.5 exposure can induce liver fibrosis, presenting cancer risk. Incorporating metabolomics, lipidomics, and transcriptomics, we propose PM2.5 exposure induces mitochondrial dysfunction, activates AMPK signaling, and increases ceramide accumulation, potentially mediating insulin resistance that contributes to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and HCC progression. This work represents a significant advancement in assessing hepatotoxicity of environmental toxicants by reducing reliance on traditional animal testing methods.

However, its traditional practices, such as burning incense and setting off fireworks, generate severe air pollution and pose significant health threats. This presents a critical dilemma regarding how rural residents balance the imperatives of cultural preservation against environmental health risks. This study investigates this trade-off using a multidisciplinary approach. Field measurements within a rural household during the 2024 festival revealed alarmingly high indoor PM2.5 levels, peaking above 1000 μg/m3 on New Year’s Eve and averaging over 600 μg/m3. Furthermore, a survey of 1035 residents across nine northern provinces found that 38.7% and 19.7% reported adverse physiological symptoms from high outdoor and indoor pollutant levels, respectively. Notably, of those experiencing symptoms, an overwhelming 81.8% were still willing to tolerate temporary air pollution for cultural fulfillment derived from the festival. This underscores that for these rural residents, the perceived value of traditional observance can outweigh immediate environmental health concerns. Therefore, policymakers must develop strategies that reconcile public health and cultural heritage. Effective interventions could include promoting eco-friendly fireworks, organizing pollution-free community events, and subsidizing advanced ventilation technologies."

Building on our previous finding that PM2.5 alters m6A RNA methylation, we hypothesized that PAHs drive asthma progression through epitranscriptomic regulation. Here, we show that PAH exposure aggravated lung injury, airway remodeling, and fibrosis while reducing global m6A levels─an effect reversed by AhR inhibition. Mechanistically, PAH-activated AhR suppressed transcription of the m6A demethylase FTO, leading to widespread hypomethylation. Reduced m6A deposition on ACKR3 mRNA enhanced its stability through IGF2BP1/2/3 binding, thereby increasing ACKR3 expression. Elevated ACKR3 promoted autophagy and inflammatory signaling in bronchial epithelial cells. Consistently, FTO-deficient mice displayed exacerbated airway inflammation, fibrosis, and ACKR3-driven autophagy. Moreover, PAHs activated the TNFα/NF-κB pathway, further amplifying autophagy and inflammation. Together, these findings define a previously unrecognized AhR–FTO–ACKR3 epitranscriptomic axis through which PAHs potentiate NF-κB signaling, autophagy, and airway injury, providing new mechanistic insight and potential therapeutic targets for pollution-driven asthma."

McIntyre,Quantifying Depuration of Methylmercury from Fish Consumption by Travelers,"During a two-week field sampling expedition in Gabon, two American scientists consumed fish daily from the Ogooué River watershed. We sampled their scalp and facial hair periodically to evaluate hair as a biomarker to track shifts in methylmercury (MeHg) exposure from diet. Each individual differed in the onset and extent of MeHg accumulation but showed similar depuration rates. Pretrip baseline Hg isotope values between participants were distinct from Gabonese fishes allowing us to detect shifts in MeHg sources in the hair of both individuals. δ202Hg values tracked the mass-dependent fractionation of MeHg depuration stemming from in vivo metabolism, leading to δ202Hg increases of 0.014 ± 0.001 per mille and total Hg losses of 8.3 ± 1.1 ng g–1 daily. While limited in scope due to minimal participants, our findings reveal a complex interaction between prior MeHg burdens, contemporary MeHg intakes, and sources of consumed fishes (locally caught versus market-sourced) in determining the dynamics of MeHg concentrations and δ202Hg in human hair. We also suggest that the offset in δ202Hg values used in literature between fish and human hair (1.75 ± 0.25‰) may overlook a time domain that increases starting fish-hair δ202Hg offsets  (0.94‰), through time."

Urinary pathogens of human origin, frequently detected in contaminated water and surfaces, represent early indicators of ARB-related exposure. However, current exposure assessment approaches rely heavily on standard strains, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. In this study, a label-free platform was developed by integrating surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) with a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the ARB exposure assessment. A comprehensive spectral database consisting of 368 clinical urinary isolates was established. The CNN achieved the highest classification accuracy (97.6%), surpassing random forest (93.1%) and PCA-SVM (91.2%). Robust performance was further confirmed in wastewater samples (92.2%) and independent urine specimens (90.3%). Importantly, SHAP-based interpretation revealed key discriminatory features in the 724–738 cm–1 region, associated with adenine and tryptophan, thereby enhancing model interpretability. Together, these findings establish a practical and transparent framework for microbial surveillance and ARB exposure assessment. This approach supports real-time monitoring and provides a practical tool for environmental health management."

Air pollution might modulate the microRNA (miRNA) content of neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NdEVs), potentially mirroring brain epigenetic alterations. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between air pollution, NdEV miRNAs, and MDD severity in a population of 200 patients with depression. After signing informed consent, participants compiled questionnaires about demographics, lifestyle and clinical history, and donated a blood sample. MDD severity was assessed by five scales. Particulate matter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) exposure was assigned based on participants’ residential address. Plasma NdEVs were obtained by L1CAM immunocapture. NdEV miRNAs were queried by RT-qPCR (microarray) following a two-stage approach. Associations between air pollutants, NdEV miRNAs, and MDD severity were assessed by multivariable regression models. The regulatory function of NdEV miRNAs was investigated by gene target and pathway analysis. As a result, exposure to NO2 was associated with decreased levels of miR-191 and miR-24, while PM2.5 was negatively associated with miR-191, miR-223, miR-24, miR-320, miR-451, miR-572, and miR-638. Decreased miR-126, miR-19b, miR-320, miR-451, miR-572, and miR-638 were associated with higher MDD severity scores. Target genes at the interface between air pollution exposure and MDD severity were mainly involved in inflammation and cell cycle regulation. These findings suggest that air pollutants might modulate MDD severity by triggering NdEV miRNA alterations. Longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate whether NdEV miRNAs might serve as novel biomarkers for MDD prognosis."

However, the effects of ozone exposure on the human microbiome remain unclear. This study conducted a controlled, randomized, crossover ozone exposure trial with 29 participants exposed to filtered air and ozone. Oral microbiome samples were collected for 16S rRNA sequencing. A mixed-effects model was used to analyze the impact of ozone exposure on the diversity and composition of the oral microbiome, as well as their association with lung functions. The results showed that the ozone concentration remained stable at 5 ± 5.1 parts per billion (ppb) under filtered air and 282.2 ± 44 ppb during ozone exposure. Acute ozone exposure significantly impaired lung function and reduced oral microbiome diversity, with forced vital capacity (FVC) decreasing by 0.41 L, expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) by 0.36 L, and peak expiratory flow (PEF) by 0.81 L, while observed species richness (Sobs), abundance-based coverage estimator (Ace), and chao indices (Chao) decreased by 21.83, 22.24, and 21.87%, respectively. Males exhibited greater sensitivity to ozone exposure than females, reflected in both reduced lung function and alterations in the oral microbiome. The altered microbiome was mainly enriched in metabolic pathways. Among the microbiome, Treponema medium exhibited a significant correlation and mediating effect on ozone-induced lung function impairment, which may serve as a sensitive indicator of changes in lung function. These findings provide new insights into the health effects caused by ozone exposure."

We evaluated the associations between long-term exposure to UFP concentrations and the incidence of overall and cause-specific CVDs in 453,692 middle-aged and older UK Biobank participants living >100 m from major roads, followed from 2006–2010 baseline to 2023. A Cox proportional hazard model was applied to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval per interquartile range increment in UFP concentrations. Long-term exposure to ambient UFP was associated with a 3% higher incidence risk of overall CVD (95% CI: 1–4%). Significant positive associations were observed for several specific CVDs, including chronic rheumatic heart diseases, hypertension, ischemic heart diseases, conduction disorders, heart failure, and cerebrovascular diseases (HRs: 1.03–1.09), while others showed no association. These associations were generally robust to adjustment of other air pollutants including PM2.5. The exposure–response relationship curves were generally linear without thresholds. This large prospective study suggests that UFP is an independent, modifiable CVD risk factor, distinct from PM2.5, relevant even for populations distant from major emission sources. This highlights the need to consider UFP in air quality management and public health strategies."

This study evaluates global Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) extremeness and climate linkages using GRACE and GRACE‐FO data from 2002 to 2024. By examining upper and lower deciles of TWS anomalies representing wet and dry extremes and assessing spatial dependencies, we identify key patterns, trends, and driving factors through dimensional reduction and probabilistic modeling. Results show global TWS extremes are governed by a 2–3‐year oscillatory cycle linked to El Niño–Southern Oscillation, which synchronizes drought and pluvial conditions across continents. Drought extremes show broader spatial coherence than pluvial events, indicating moisture deficits propagate more uniformly through the land–atmosphere system. A weaker quasi‐decadal cycle (6–10 years) modulates these responses and underlies a shift around 2011–2012. Before 2011, wet extremes intensified, while after 2012, dry extremes became dominant, particularly in interior Asia, western United States, and southern Africa. Neither pluvial nor drought extremes show significant global trends in intensity; however, they remain phase‐locked, with wet events twice as intense as dry ones, reflecting asymmetric hydrologic response to moisture surpluses versus deficits. We probabilistically reconstruct TWS extremeness during satellite data gaps using leading spatio‐temporal patterns. The current record, spanning less than one multidecadal cycle, remains insufficient for robust attribution. Extending satellite gravimetry is essential to refine uncertainty in attributing global pluvial and drought extremes under climate change."

Understanding of past extremes and their meaningfulness for contextualizing future possibilities, especially in the near‐term, is limited by the absence of a global analysis focused on the most extreme humid‐heat‐anomaly events. Here we identify record‐setting humid‐heat days for 216 global regions and assess the likelihood of these records being broken even under present‐day climate forcing. We use several reanalyses as a historical catalogue, and large climate‐model ensembles to represent other statistically plausible events. Unlike the spatial pattern of large temperature anomalies, we find that humid‐heat anomalies are most intense, and most seasonally and interannually concentrated, in the deep tropics and arid subtropics. Many top events have attracted little if any prior attention. The eastern United States is especially susceptible to record‐breaking humid heat due to modest current records (>1% inferred annual exceedance probability) contrasting with numerous simulated large‐anomaly days. Australia and eastern China are also prone to locally exceptional episodes, with >40% of ensemble members simulating events exceeding the ERA5‐based distribution maximum. Model biases for key characteristics, together with the observed record‐setting day affecting its estimated return period by >2.5x in half of regions, underline several valuable aspects of a joint observation/model perspective on humid heat. This approach aids in evaluating the plausibility of as‐yet‐unseen extremes; identifying regions of concern that might otherwise be overlooked and underprepared; and gauging regionally specific correlations between event magnitudes and societal impacts."

Although the combined effects of stressors are recognized, the manner in which the prestress state determines the basic response mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we used the “natural experiment” methodology to compare two major extreme events within a monsoon‐influenced, low‐latitude highlands setting to explain mechanistic changes in land‐atmosphere interactions. By analyzing an extensive set of remote sensing and reanalysis data with nonlinear structural equation modeling, we show that the ecosystem response shifted from a traditional water‐limited paradigm during the 2010 drought to an energy‐governed paradigm during the 2019 heatwave. Our results suggest that this transition is governed by the antecedent root zone soil moisture status, which acts as a tipping point fundamentally shifting the impact of atmospheric factors on canopy evapotranspiration screens, such as temperature and vapor pressure deficit. This study highlights a possible threshold‐type state dependence non‐linearity, which is lacking in major Earth System Models. Incorporating this “hydrological memory” is crucial for minimizing uncertainties in climate projections and for correctly assessing the vulnerability of ecosystems in a warming world."

The results show that municipal solid‐waste incineration exhibited the highest concentrations of total particulate halogen and particulate chlorine (pCl). Iron‐ore sintering showed the highest concentrations of particulate fluorine (pF) and particulate bromine (pBr). Using the emission factor method, we identified cement kilns co‐processing solid waste and iron‐ore sintering as the most significant emission sources, with annual emissions of p(F + Cl + Br) reaching 32,785 and 6,155 t, respectively. Eastern China had significantly higher emissions of p(F + Cl + Br) than other regions. Furthermore, emissions across provinces were generally higher during the cold season than in warmer seasons.

 Time-resolved resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (tr-RIXS) is a powerful technique for probing quasiparticle interactions in quantum materials under nonequilibrium conditions. Here, we implement tr-RIXS at the carbon K-edge to investigate the ultrafast dynamics of core excitons coupled to vibrational modes in graphite. Using femtosecond X-ray pulses from a free-electron laser, we monitor the temporal evolution of vibronically dressed excitons and their interaction with symmetry-selective optical phonons. By tuning the incident photon energy across the 1s → σ* resonance and analyzing the integrated inelastic sideband intensity, we reveal a detuning-controlled crossover between two complementary dynamical regimes. Phenomenological modeling and first-principles calculations reproduce both the magnitude and detuning dependence of the spectral-weight changes. In this work, enabled by the unique capabilities of X-ray free-electron lasers, we demonstrate how tr-RIXS can access coupled electronic and lattice dynamics with elemental and symmetry specificity, opening new routes to control vibronic interactions in light-element and low-dimensional quantum materials.

 Spaceborne Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) has been widely demonstrated as an effective method for ocean wind speed retrieval. This study explores the feasibility of using track-wise GNSS-R wind products to generate gap-free wind fields. A physics-informed neural mapping scheme, 4DVarNet, is adapted to reconstruct wind fields. Results indicate that the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the 1-hour, 3-hour, and 6-hour 4DVarNet winds are 1.13 m/s, 1.16 m/s, and 1.24 m/s compared to European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) ERA5 wind products, while 1.40 m/s, 1.41 m/s, and 1.48 m/s are referred to Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2 (AMSR2) all-weather winds. Spatial and temporal error analyses further confirm the robustness of 4DVarNet-derived winds, with daily RMSEs remaining below 1.6 m/s. Error decomposition reveals discrepancies between ECMWF and GNSS-R winds, which may support future recalibration of GNSS-R wind products or enhancements to ECMWF forecasts. A case study of Super Typhoon Surigae proves that 4DVarNet winds closely align with the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) track data. The reconstructed winds detect the peak intensity temporally consistent with IBTrACS data, whereas ECMWF forecasts exhibit a two-day lag. Moreover, asymmetries in Tropical Storm Kompasu are observed, with the radius of maximum wind (Rmax) over the Northeast quadrant 38% larger than that over the Northwest quadrant. Despite the absence of background wind field inputs, 4DVarNet effectively learns wind patterns from ECMWF data and integrates GNSS-R observations to generate gap-free wind mappings, exhibiting strong agreement with ECMWF wind fields. The reconstruction performance is degraded at high winds due to the underestimation of referenced ECMWF ERA5 winds and the small quantity of observations. This limitation could be alleviated through denser GNSS-R observations from multiple missions such as Fengyun-3, Tianmu-1, recently launched HydroGNSS, etc., and other training references with more high winds for improving the representation of 4DVarNet at high winds."

 Advances in Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology, along with point cloud modeling techniques like Quantitative Structure Models (QSM), have improved the accuracy of non-destructive above-ground tree biomass estimation. However, branch-level tree growth analysis using QSM time series remains underexplored due to challenges in data quality and methodology. This study investigates the boundary conditions in terms of data and species to facilitate robust QSM generation, which could enable branch-level growth analysis using multi-temporal LiDAR data and QSM. A multi-scan terrestrial laser scanning dataset and a dataset from a tower-based system were used to assess the impact of data acquisition setup and data quality on QSM reconstruction for birch (Betula pendula), pines (Pinus sylvestris), and spruces (Picea abies). The results show that reliable QSMs for detecting branch-level growth require a minimum spatial resolution of approximately 500 pts./m3 with a uniform point density, a maximum uniform 3D point distance of 2 cm, and gaps smaller than around 20 cm. Although smaller spherical noise clusters can be removed using denoising techniques, larger and denser noise clusters (e.g., > 9500 points within 1 m radius) are more likely to be misidentified as additional branches. Foliage removal methods risk modeling accuracy by inadvertently removing woody points. Regarding species, birches were more accurately modeled than pines and spruces. While QSMs are reproducible for single time points, comparing branches over time is challenging due to inconsistencies in modeled branching order and scanner positioning. Nonetheless, tree-level QSM metrics remain statistically consistent, revealing diverse growth strategies within and across species."

 Streetlights are essential infrastructure in cities. They enhance traffic and public safety at night, but they also entail significant energy consumption. The study of the density, quantity and distribution of streetlights is essential for sustainable urban development. The Sustainable Development Global Scientific Satellite-1 has enriched night-time light data. This study is based on the Crowded Scene Recognition Network (CSRNet) and proposes a novel Streetlight Counting Network (SLCNet) by introducing a deeper front-end network and adding a spatial attention mechanism. This model can effectively estimate the density distribution of streetlights within a region and achieve automatic counting of large-scale streetlight numbers. Experimental results show that SLCNet achieves a mean absolute error of 135.35, a root mean square error of 231.37, and a normalised absolute error of 0.22, representing reductions of 5.60 %, 8.08 %, and 12.00 % respectively outperforming the original CSRNet model. The visualisation results also show that SLCNet predicts the distribution of streetlight density more accurately than CSRNet. Comprehensive ablation experiments further validate the effectiveness of each improvement method. Compared with the high-resolution yet costly Jilin-1 night-time images, SLCNet maintains comparable accuracy while enabling large-scale streetlight density and quantity estimation with publicly accessible SDGSAT-1 images. This study demonstrates the application potential of SDGSAT-1 in urban night-time lighting monitoring, providing new technical pathways and research frameworks for urban lighting management, sustainable development assessment, and smart city construction."

 Sea ice type information is important for climate change research and human activities in polar regions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, particularly from the Sentinel-1 (S1) mission, has become a key source for high-resolution sea ice mapping. With the growing volume of S1 SAR data, deep learning (DL) methods have been explored for sea ice classification. However, the limited availability of fine labels and overlapping backscatter intensity among ice types remain major obstacles to achieving automated fine-scale sea ice classification across the pan-Arctic region. This paper proposes a model, named IceDeepLab, for the automatic mapping of sea ice type across the pan-Arctic region in winter using S1 dual-polarized SAR images, based on the Deep Learning framework DeepLabv3+. The IceDeepLab can identify open water, young ice, first-year ice and old ice, generating pixel-wise classification maps at 400 m resolution. A sea ice type dataset, comprising 174 finely labelled S1 images from November 2019 to March 2020 and covering the pan-Arctic region with diverse sea ice conditions, is established for model training and validation. In particular, radar incidence angle is included as an input to mitigate its effects on HH-polarized SAR data. The model integrates the spatially optimised ConvNeXt backbone, the newly proposed Enhanced Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling module, and tailored training and inference schemes. These designs make it more suitable for processing whole SAR images, effectively reducing ambiguity between different sea ice types and eliminating stitching lines, thereby improving overall performance. Experiments on the test dataset show that IceDeepLab achieves an overall accuracy of 91.9%, a mean intersection over union of 82.3%, and a mean F1-score of 90.2%, significantly outperforming the traditional DeepLabv3+ by 16.0%, 10.0%, and 11.1%, respectively. When applied to 4153 S1 images collected from November 2020 to March 2021, IceDeepLab maintains over 90% agreement with operational ice charts in the pan-Arctic region, demonstrating the model's robustness across different years. Ablation experiments, feature visualizations, and statistical analyses further validate the model's effectiveness and offer insights for future improvements in sea ice classification algorithms. Furthermore, evaluations using both the radiometer-derived sea ice concentration product and a year-round ice type dataset are conducted to explore its potential for broader applications in operational sea ice monitoring."

 Sentinel-1 is a unique resource for global flood monitoring, providing systematic, weather-independent Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery with unprecedented coverage. To overcome limitations of on-demand flood mapping services that depend on human operators to collect and interpret satellite images, a fundamentally new approach was adopted by the Global Flood Monitoring (GFM) service. This service, which was launched in 2021 as part of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS), processes all Sentinel-1 land images acquired in VV polarisation fully automatically in near-real time. This article presents the first comprehensive analysis of GFM’s scientific achievements and challenges during its initial years of operation. To map floods reliably under diverse environmental conditions, GFM combines three complementary flood-mapping algorithms with reference water datasets to differentiate flooded areas from permanent and seasonal water bodies. The service also offers a novel flood-likelihood layer and contextual information to highlight areas where flood mapping is unreliable or not feasible. These data layers were derived from a global 20 m backscatter datacube containing approximately 379 billion land surface pixels. This datacube also made it possible to generate the first global Sentinel-1 flood archive (2015 to present). Our performance analysis shows that GFM typically delivers flood maps within five hours of image acquisition. However, a significant percentage of floods may go undetected due to coverage gaps. Initial evaluation results show that good accuracies are achieved for larger-scale floods and regions in the temperate and tropical zones, while accuracies are lower for smaller-scale floods and arid environments. The GFM service will continue to improve service quality by enhancing flood detection capabilities using improved algorithms and additional data, such as the VH channel from Sentinel-1 or L-band data from the upcoming ROSE-L mission."

 Soil moisture is a critical variable for hydrology, agriculture and climate. However, large-scale soil moisture observation remains difficult due to sparse in situ networks and the inability of optical sensors to capture it under cloud cover. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) missions, e.g., Sentinel-1, yield unique all-weather, day and night observations with a fine spatial and temporal resolution that makes them of interest for development of global soil moisture monitoring. Consequently, this review discusses the application of C-band SAR observations from the Sentinel-1 satellite mission to estimate high-resolution near-surface soil moisture. First, the importance of SAR backscatter monitoring from Sentinel-1 is emphasized. Next, the current state-of-the-art in soil moisture retrieval from Sentinel-1 is presented. Although considerable progress has been made in near-surface soil moisture retrieval, several limitations remain. Factors such as the effects of vegetation and surface roughness on the signal, sensor and scattering model limitations, spatial and temporal constraints, and uncertainties, e.g. in data assimilation, pose challenges to its usage. While Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based retrieval methods have shown promise, their interpretability, dependence on large datasets, vulnerability to data quality, and computational burden have been major challenges. Beyond methods that rely on backscatter, there have been recent works indicating that SAR interferometric observables have the potential to estimate soil moisture, especially in arid and semi-arid regions where these are particularly sensitive to moisture changes. To address these challenges, this paper recommends integrating Sentinel-1 with other satellite mission data for a multi-sensor data integration approach (e.g., Sentinel-2 and Soil Moisture Active Passive - SMAP data), refining physical and semi-empirical models, developing advanced AI techniques able to consider physical principles, and combining with emerging data from other high temporal resolution SAR missions (e.g., NASA-ISRO SAR). The review concludes with identification of key research priorities, including standardization of retrieval frameworks, improved validation efforts on standardized reference sets, and cloud processing for real-time user cases. Overall, the review provides a thorough foundation for understanding, refining, and advancing Sentinel-1 based soil moisture retrieval methods."

 Peatland restoration can halt biodiversity loss and organic soil degradation and mitigate climate change. Monitoring of restoration impacts requires novel approaches that can be scaled to large site networks. On a smaller scale, the restoration practitioners would likewise benefit from spatially and temporally comprehensive and objective monitoring data. This narrative review compiles potential remote sensing methods for practical monitoring of the ecohydrological processes in restoration of forestry-drained boreal peatlands to support and complement conventional ground monitoring approaches that are restricted by spatial coverage. Remote sensing provides tools for tracking the changes in soil surface moisture, water flow routes, vegetation cover and structure, topography, peat depth and greenhouse gas emissions. We emphasize that the suitable indicators of restoration success, platforms and sensors should be tailored to specific restoration cases with their own initial site conditions and restoration targets. The choice of spatial and temporal resolutions of data is defined by the scale and change rate of the restoration indicators. Data acquisition campaigns and selection of existing datasets require meticulous planning due to seasonal changes in hydrology and vegetation. We also compiled practical experiences on selecting remote sensing tools and ensuring satisfactory data quality to facilitate the implementation of remote-sensing-based monitoring. Finally, we provide recommendations on how the rapid development of remote sensing technology, encompassing new uncrewed applications and novel sensors on conventional platforms, can offer a range of monitoring tools to cater to the growing needs for spatially comprehensive data amounts assessing peatland restoration success in boreal conditions."

 Buried lakes are widely distributed on the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) after summer. Some of these lakes may drain over winter, thereby delivering meltwater into the ice sheet and potentially influencing ice flow dynamics. However, to date, only a limited number of buried lake drainages (BLDs) have been identified and their spatiotemporal dynamics across the GrIS remain unclear. Here we detect pan-GrIS wintertime BLDs by integrating Sentinel-1 and -2 satellite imagery and ArcticDEM data. We begin by locating potential buried lakes with topographic depressions. Then we identify the depressions with significant wintertime backscatter increases as potential BLDs using Sentinel-1 SAR imagery. Next, we map the maximum summertime meltwater area using Sentinel-2 imagery and select the potential BLDs with sufficient summertime meltwater as final BLDs. Finally, we categorize these final BLDs into three types (complete BLDs, partial BLDs, and low-confidence BLDs), and we also investigate potential ice velocity anomalies (IVAs) triggered by BLDs using ice velocity data. The results show that: (1) 167 complete and partial BLDs are identified over seven winters from 2017 to 2023 on the GrIS, including 25 cascade drainages; their spatiotemporal distributions vary significantly, with most BLDs detected at the NW, CW, and SW basins in November. (2) Wintertime BLDs potentially trigger 10 significant IVAs (up to 50 %), and may lead to a net increase in annual ice motion. (3) Wintertime IVAs triggered by BLDs are significantly higher than summertime IVAs triggered by supraglacial lake drainages; they propagate downstream along subglacial hydrologic pathways rather than ice flowlines. (4) BLDs can even trigger rerouting of subglacial hydrologic pathways over a short time period. In conclusion, we present a new method of detecting sparse wintertime BLDs over large areas and reveal that BLDs have a more profound effect on ice flow dynamics than previously assumed."

 Multimodal remote sensing imagery has been widely used in many fields. However, in specific scenarios, it is challenging to acquire the key modality, making it difficult to extract the land cover mapping information in conditions of missing modalities. Existing missing modality learning methods transfer historical complete modal feature knowledge to single-modal features disrupting their feature distribution, and leading to poor performance in downstream tasks. To address the aforementioned issue, a multimodal remote sensing land cover dataset called EarthMiss is designed to simulate real-world missing modality scenarios. EarthMiss comprises 3355 pairs of 0.6-meter high-resolution Optical and SAR images collected from 13 cities spanning five continents, including 8 common types of land cover objects, making it the multimodal remote sensing dataset with the highest number of classes at this high resolution. Besides, a remote sensing meta modal representation framework named MetaRS is proposed for missing modality land cover mapping task. MetaRS presents a meta-modal aware module to extract modality-invariant features for missing modality feature recovery, and a meta-modal representation regularization training strategy to guide meta-modal focus on task-related feature representation. Specifically, we disentangle features by supervising the covariance matrix of multi-modal features, and knowledge transfer takes place solely, thereby ensuring the consistency of the transferred knowledge. Then, a meta-modal representation branch fuses the meta-features of all modalities and calculates the prediction loss for them. Comprehensive experiments conducted across EarthMiss dataset, four additional benchmarks, and a 2023 Libyan-flood case study demonstrate that MetaRS significantly surpasses existing methods, and provides a promising alternative for multimodal remote sensing applications.

 Near-real-time (NRT) daily crop monitoring at the field scale is crucial for precision agriculture, yet remains challenging due to limitations in the spatial or temporal resolution of existing remote sensing methods. While Sentinel-2 provides adequate spatial resolution for field-level applications, its temporal resolution is insufficient for capturing rapid crop dynamics, especially in cloudy regions. Existing spatiotemporal fusion techniques require multiple clear-sky images and lack true NRT capability, while ground-based sensors offer continuous monitoring but with limited spatial coverage. To address these limitations, this study develops the Near-Real-Time Ground-Satellite Fusion (NRT-GSF) algorithm, a novel approach based on a Bayesian dynamic linear model and Kalman filtering. The algorithm uniquely integrates Sentinel-2 imagery with continuous measurements from Internet of Things for Agriculture (IoTA) systems to generate daily 10-m Green Area Index (GAI) products. Its recursive framework supports both forward prediction in NRT mode following satellite overpasses and backward updating to refine historical profiles. Implemented over French wheat fields using 34 IoTA systems and Sentinel-2 time series from 2019, the algorithm effectively enhanced spatiotemporal completeness and accuracy (R = 0.75–0.98, RMSE = 0.1–0.49). A comprehensive leave-one-out Sentinel-2 evaluation demonstrated its superiority over the current Consistent Adjustment of the Climatology to Actual Observations (CACAO) algorithm. Ground validation using handheld RGB cameras further confirmed the accuracy of the GAI products from the new algorithm (RMSE = 0.5). The NRT-GSF framework offers a robust and operationally solution for daily, high-resolution crop GAI mapping in NRT mode, and it can be extended to other traits or applications in the near-real-time context."

 The accurate three-dimensional (3D) distribution of plant area density (PAD) within forests is crucial for understanding canopy structure and provides essential scene inputs for 3D Radiative Transfer Models (RTMs) to facilitate remote sensing interpretation. However, current lidar-based voxelization methods that estimate detailed PAD distributions often cover limited areas, constraining their applications in conducting broad forest studies and interpreting Earth Observation Satellite (EOS) data of various scales and resolutions. To address this, we developed the Large-Scale Path Volume Leaf Area Density (LS-PVlad), a novel forest 3D reconstruction workflow capable of producing extensive high-resolution 3D voxelized forest scenes (up to 100 km2 with ≤2 m voxel size) from worldwide open-access airborne lidar scanning (ALS) data. By applying LS-PVlad to the ALS data acquired during the extensive NASA Goddard's LiDAR, Hyperspectral & Thermal Imager (G-LiHT) campaigns, we developed the first release of FoScenes—a high-fidelity PAD product comprising 40 seamless scenes from 28 diverse forest sites, with individual area ranging from ∼50 to ∼11,000 ha. The leaf area estimates of LS-PVlad have been validated by two-year field-measured leaf area index (LAI) from litter collection (best RMSE = 0.35 m2/m2) and digital hemispherical photography (DHP) images (RMSE = 0.46 m2/m2) across multiple plots at a deciduous forest site. Additionally, a broad comparison between FoScenes and MODIS plant/leaf area index product demonstrates high consistency (R2 = 0.70, RMSE = 0.86 m2/m2). By providing multi-dimensional forest characterizations, FoScenes enables temporal insights into structure dynamics. Its integration with the discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model underscores the potential of FoScenes for extensive 3D RTM applications at various scales."

 To accurately invert the canopy parameters (Total photosynthetic area index, TPAI) of oilseed rape, a microwave characteristic layered measurement experiment was designed, and a multilayer microwave scattering semiempirical model (MLMSSM) was constructed based on the radar response changes induced by the differences in the vertical structure and canopy components at different phenological stages. This model was then applied to the main oilseed rape production areas to conduct regional TPAI inversion. Microwave characteristic layered measurement experiments were performed at six-leaf, flowering, beginning ripening and fully ripening stages of oilseed rape in the laboratory of target microwave properties (LAMP). The MLMSSM was constructed based on the LAMP-measured data, corresponding to different plant structures containing two- and three-layer submodels, and the TPAI inversion model was derived based on the correlation between the MLMSSM parameters and the crop biophysical variables. Finally, regional TPAI inversion and validation were carried out in the main oilseed rape production area (Hengyang), using Sentinel-1 SAR data. Visualization results, MLMSSM parameters and TPAI inversion results based on LAMP data all revealed the occurrence of multiple scattering interactions among distinct oilseed rape structural layers and verified the effectiveness of the measurement scheme and the model. The regional validation results showed high TPAI inversion accuracy throughout entire oilseed rape growth stages, with R2 = 0.78, RMSE = 1.03, and MAE = 0.74 under VV polarization, and R2 = 0.84, RMSE = 0.75, and MAE = 0.52 under VH polarization. The MLMSSM was found to significantly outperform the modified water cloud model (MWCM), increasing R2 by 0.05 and 0.18 under VV and VH polarization respectively, while reducing the RMSE and MAE by 0.49–0.72. These results prove the accuracy and applicability of the MLMSSM for regional TPAI inversion of oilseed rape."

 Soil spectroscopy is a powerful technique for soil monitoring. Hundreds of soil spectral datasets, both open-access and private, are used for various applications, despite potential errors. This study presents a filtering protocol to enhance the quality of soil spectral datasets from laboratory and satellite sources, here termed the Spectral Quality Protocol (SQuaP). At the beginning, we utilized a database of 9261 Brazilian soil samples, with paired laboratory hyperspectral (350–2500 nm), and Sentinel-2 multispectral data. Afterwards, we tested SQuaP on world-wide open datasets and on bare soil satellite observations identified by the Geospatial Soil Sensing System (GEOS3). A filtering approach is presented where we applied rule-based checks (crop residues, reflectance trend) flagged outliers via PCA-Mahalanobis, enforced contextual consistency with soil line regression, detecd cluster-aware anomalies using Isolation Forest within clusters, and validated property spectrum coherence via Random-Forest residuals. Results demonstrated at SQuaP enhances spectral data reliability, and consequently modeling performance of clay and soil organic carbon (SOC) using a Random Forest algorithm. For the hyperspectral data SQuaP increased R2 of 17.55 % for clay and 1.58 % for SOC, and reduced RMSE by 10.41 g kg−1 and 2.06 g kg−1, respectively. For satellite data, the improvements were even more pronounced, with an increase of 15.76 % for clay and 13.38 % for SOC on R2, and a reduction in RMSE. At the world scale, predictive performance improved after the implementation of SQuaP in nearly all continents, with gains in R2 ranging from −2.15 % to 13.40 % across evaluated scenarios. These findings highlight SQuAP's effectiveness in noise filtering and improving predictive accuracy, particularly for multispectral data. Furthermore, these improvements were achieved without compromising data variability, as confirmed by Kernel Desnsity Estimation (KDE) analysis, indicating that the protocol successfully removed outliers while preserving the statistical integrity of the dataset. SQuaP can be adapted to suit specific datasets and applications, facilitating more accurate soil property predictions and advancing in digital soil mapping and precision agriculture."

 Irrigation is the major consumer of freshwater resources on Earth and represents the largest human intervention in the water cycle. Most irrigation modeling frameworks rely on simplified assumptions regarding the timing of irrigation that result in significant error in the irrigation water use estimation. In this study, we developed a generalized data-driven approach for estimating these irrigation timing attributes using a change point detection algorithm applied to thermal remote sensing data. Land surface temperature at cropland pixels was compared with hydrologically similar natural land cover pixels nearby to extract irrigation attributes. The approach was evaluated over two areas: Nebraska (NEB) and Mahabad, Iran (MAH), for which we had the in situ irrigation data. The method detected the start and end of the irrigation season with reasonable accuracy, exhibiting errors of 18 % and 15 % in estimating the duration of season, in NEB and MAH respectively. The cloud cover either at the start or the end of season was the primary source of error in both cases. Irrigation event detection accuracy across 10 NEB sites yielded F1-scores (Precision & recall combined score) of 0.59–0.74, varying with change point detection algorithm parameters. To optimize these parameters, extensive hyperparameter tuning was performed, leading to specific suggestions tailored for different irrigation practices. The results presented here demonstrate that the LST-based approach can be effective in characterizing interannual variations in irrigation timing attributes."

Additionally, a new radar-based vegetation index, SVIdp, is proposed and tested for the first time. This index is based on the interaction of dual-polarization scattering components. The results show: (1) The WCM-Oh model significantly improved retrieval accuracy in typical vegetation areas (grasslands and crops), with the correlation coefficient (R) increasing by 0.10 and the root mean square error (RMSE) decreasing by 2 %–14 %, compared to the independent WCM model; (2) Under different land cover types, the WCM-Oh2004 coupling model based on GNDVI demonstrated high prediction accuracy (R = 0.66–0.85, ubRMSE = 0.0392–0.0698 m3/m3) in areas with moderate vegetation cover (e.g., grassland A, herbaceous vegetation A/B, wheat/corn rotation areas).

 Plant traits serve as critical indicators of how plants adapt to environmental changes and influence ecosystem functions. While airborne hyperspectral remote sensing effectively maps plant traits through detailed reflectance properties, it is limited by cost and scale, making large-scale and temporal studies challenging. The recently launched spaceborne hyperspectral imager, PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA), offers frequent, large scale and high-fidelity observations on a spatial resolution of 30 m and a revisit time of around 29 days, making it suitable for large-scale seasonal trait mapping. However, their potential remains largely unexplored. This study developed a multi-stage framework by leveraging the PRISMA spaceborne hyperspectral data and National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) hyperspectral data to investigate the seasonal dynamics of four key plant traits — chlorophyll content, carotenoid content, equivalent water thickness, and nitrogen content — across eleven NEON sites representing diverse forest types and ecoregions in the contiguous U.S. Our results demonstrated that PRISMA hyperspectral data can reliably track seasonal variability in plant traits, achieving overall R2 values ranging from 0.78 to 0.88 and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) values ranging from 5.4 % to 8.4 % for the four traits. Seasonal patterns revealed bell-shaped trajectories for chlorophyll and carotenoids, while equivalent water thickness decreased steadily across most sites, driven by structural changes during leaf maturation and senescence. Nitrogen content exhibited less pronounced seasonal variation but followed expected nutrient resorption patterns. Analysis of environmental drivers showed that seasonal variability is primarily controlled by solar radiation and day length in northern sites, vapor pressure in semi-arid regions, and temperature in mid-southeastern sites. Spatial variability, meanwhile, was primarily driven by soil properties, particularly during the peak growing season. However, the influence of soil variables slightly declines toward the end of the season at several sites, as climatic factors become more prominent. This study highlights the capability of PRISMA, and potentially other similar spaceborne hyperspectral data for large-scale, time-series plant trait mapping and provides valuable insights into the interactions between plant traits and environmental factors. These findings contribute to advancing our understanding of plant functional ecology and improving predictions of ecosystem responses to environmental changes."

 Sun-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) is the most promising remote-sensing proxy of Gross Primary Production (GPP) in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the estimation of GPP using SIF is challenging when plants experience stress, particularly during extreme climatic events whose frequency is projected to increase in the future. Recently, the feasibility of canopy-level active chlorophyll fluorescence measurements (LED-induced chlorophyll fluorescence), which directly measure the apparent fluorescence yield (FyieldLIF), has provided new perspectives on detecting the responses of plants to stress. This study was conducted during the summer 2022 European heat waves in a mixed temperate deciduous broadleaf forest, located in the French Fontainebleau-Barbeau station. Continuous measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2) and energy exchanges, SIF, FyieldLIF, and ancillary environmental variables were acquired. We investigated how heat-wave induced high atmospheric dryness, measured as Vapor Pressure Deficit, affected canopy chlorophyll fluorescence (both SIF and FyieldLIF) and GPP, as well as their relationships. At the half-hourly scale, our results revealed a decrease of the correlation between SIF and GPP (R2 decreased from 0.49 to 0.17) at high atmospheric dryness. In contrast, the correlation between FyieldLIF and GPP increased significantly under high atmospheric dryness (R2 increased from 0.07 to 0.43). However, at the daily scale, the correlations between SIF and GPP and between FyieldLIF and GPP showed an overall increase compared to the half-hourly scale, suggesting a time-scale-dependent response of these relationships to atmospheric dryness. This study also highlighted FyieldLIF's advantage in detecting plant responses to high atmospheric dryness, and emphasized the potential of canopy-level active chlorophyll fluorescence for assessing the chlorophyll fluorescence-photosynthesis relationship under extreme climatic conditions."

 Many commodity crops have growth stages during which they are particularly vulnerable to stress-induced yield loss. In-season crop progress information is useful for quantifying crop risk, and satellite remote sensing (RS) can be used to track progress at regional scales. At present, all existing RS-based crop progress estimation (CPE) methods which target crop-specific stages rely on ground truth data for training/calibration. Such data are collected via field trials or surveys. This reliance on ground survey data confines CPE methods to surveyed regions, limiting their utility. In this study, a new method is developed for conducting RS-based in-season CPE in unsurveyed regions by combining data from surveyed regions with synthetic crop progress data generated for an unsurveyed region of interest. Corn-growing zones in Argentina were used as surrogate ‘unsurveyed’ regions. These zones have climates and dual planting systems which differ from the single planting system in the US Midwest – the surveyed region in this study. Existing weather generation, crop growth, and optical radiative transfer models were linked to produce synthetic weather, crop progress, and canopy reflectance data. These data mimic weather, cultivars, and cropping practices in the unsurveyed region. A neural network (NN) method based upon bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory was trained separately on surveyed data, synthetic data, and two different combinations of surveyed and synthetic data. In the absence of real validation data in unsurveyed regions, a stopping criterion was developed which uses the weighted divergence of surveyed and synthetic data validation loss. F1 score was modified to measure CPE accuracy when the NN was trained on each data combination, with scores based on over- and under-estimates of crop progress throughout the season. Including synthetic data during training improved performance in 9 out of 11 corn-growing zones in Argentina. Net F1 scores across all crop progress stages increased by 8.7% when trained on a combination of surveyed region and synthetic data, and overall performance was only 21% lower than when the NN was trained on surveyed data and applied in the US Midwest. Performance gain from synthetic data was greatest in zones with dual planting windows, while the inclusion of surveyed region data from the US Midwest helped mitigate NN sensitivity to noise in NDVI data. Overall results suggest in-season CPE in other unsurveyed regions may be possible with increased quantity and variety of synthetic crop progress data."

 Operational national forest monitoring requires frequent, reliable observations for timely detection of deforestation and other forest changes. However, tropical forests, which encompass all current major deforestation fronts, are often hampered by persistent cloud cover. While radar remote sensing offers a compelling complement to optical data, a significant research gap remains in distinguishing the strengths and limitations of different radar sensors to the multiple stages of forest disturbance. Given the impending rapid expansion of available data outside the C band, it is imperative to assess the ability of these sensors to rapidly and accurately detect changes of high importance to the remote sensing community.To address this gap, we investigated the sensitivity of two freely available radar datasets — JAXA’s ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 (L-band) and ESA’s Sentinel-1 (C-band) — to distinct stages of tropical forest loss. With a particular focus on detecting the earliest stage of deforestation, we compared backscatter values, SAR indices, and statistical metrics against time series data from 92 locations over three years in the Amazon. In these locations, early deforestation, biomass burning, and vegetation regrowth were occurring in different stages of the full conversion process. Our analysis revealed that the L-band-derived Radar Forest Degradation Index (RFDI) is highly sensitive to early deforestation, even when biomass remains on the ground soon after cutting. In contrast, C-band information showed limited ability to sense this critical initial stage of change, but was much stronger at detecting later deforestation stages. Our results point the way toward combining information from the upcoming L-Band NISAR mission with the existing C-band information to produce a multi-component system that can accurately detect deforestation in all its temporal stages."

 Land subsidence (LS) threatens public safety and sustainable socioeconomic development across the United States (US). Wide-area LS mapping plays a crucial role in improving the characterization of LS, thus contributing to a better understanding of its impacts beyond national borders. However, a nationwide LS map for the US is still lacking, and mapping LS at this scale faces challenges such as atmospheric artifacts, computational limitations, and data calibration issues. We develop a strategy for mapping and identifying LS on a nationwide scale. This strategy includes average deformation calculation, mosaicking of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) results, and LS areas extraction using deep learning. Using this strategy and extensive SAR data, we present the first high-resolution, nationwide LS map for the contiguous U. S. (CONUS), derived from 23,391 ascending Sentinel-1 images acquired between 2019 and 2021. Our analysis reveals that LS affects all 48 states and the District of Columbia, covering ∼45,666 km2. Approximately 73 % of LS occurs in cultivated lands, 10 % in wetlands, with groundwater overexploitation being the predominant driver of subsidence. These subsiding areas expose 6.26 million people, 160,071 buildings, and critical infrastructure, including thousands of kilometers of railways and roads. Although some measures have been implemented to mitigate LS, existing cases suggest that long-term groundwater management is essential, and significant challenges remain in addressing severe LS.

 Accurate characterization of the surface radiation budget (SRB) is essential for understanding the Earth's climate. Satellite-based SRB products are typically generated through estimating different components separately using various algorithms, thereby resulting in varying uncertainties and poor conservation. This study developed the SRB conservation constraint multi-task learning densely connected convolutional neural network models to jointly estimate global daily SRB at 1 km spatial resolution from MODIS observations spanning 2000–2023. These observations include reflectance from bands 1–5, 7, and 19; thermal radiance from bands 28–29 and 31–34; and ancillary information such as elevation, solar-viewing geometry, and GLASS-MODIS surface longwave radiation. Validation results against 224 sites over three years showed that the RMSEs of daily estimates for downward, upward, and net shortwave radiation were 29.38, 20.73, and 23.14 Wm−2, respectively; for downward, upward, and net longwave radiation, they were 19.98, 15.69, and 14.70 Wm−2; and for net radiation, it was 24.28 Wm−2. This method improves the underestimations of downward and net shortwave radiation in the MCD18A1, GLASS-MODIS, and BESS products; the accuracy of retrievals for downward and net longwave radiation is better than those from GLASS-MODIS and CERES-SYN. The estimates also reduce the non-conservation by 26.69 % compared to GLASS-MODIS. These improvements lie in the method's ability to enhance retrieval accuracy by utilizing cross-domain features from all components and to address non-conservation issues in SRB retrievals through the constraint of SRB conservation in the training. The SRB estimates exhibit great spatiotemporal consistency with other SRB products, except for regional reflected solar radiation and net radiation. The high accuracy and great conservation facilitate understanding of the coordinated variation of the SRB components, and these new SRB products would benefit a variety of fields, such as climate, ecology, and hydrology.

 The encroachment of human settlements into wildland areas has expanded the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI), disrupting ecosystems and increasing wildfire risks. A systematic mapping of woody vegetation and building structures across the wildland-urban continuum is critical for fire risk and ecosystem service assessment, fuel management, conservation, and land use planning. The highly heterogeneous and dynamic nature of this landscape requires a fine-scale monitoring approach. Although machine learning and computer vision have advanced land cover classification using very high resolution imagery (VHR), most studies either focus on identifying only a particular object or a limited study area. We here developed a unified semantic segmentation deep learning model (U-Net) to map trees, shrubs, and building footprints at 0.6 m resolution using the open-source VHR multispectral imagery from the National Aerial Imaging Program (NAIP) for the state of California. A semi-automatic labeling process was adapted to generate a large set of labels for model training and testing with available aerial LiDAR surveys. The validation showed robust performance of the trained U-Net model in predicting canopy-scale trees and shrubs as well as buildings, achieving an overall accuracy of 87.1% and F1 scores of 83.1% for trees and 78.9% for shrubs across different years. Further evaluation demonstrated that this approach captured the fine-scale spatial arrangement of woody vegetation and buildings, and the temporal vegetation dynamics from selective logging, regrowth, and tree mortality following wildfire. The model’s scalability was also shown for county and statewide mapping. Given the availability of open-access NAIP imagery every 2–3 years over the continental US, our scalable approach provides a sub-meter monitoring tool and data to improve ecological and building assessment and fire simulation. These capabilities support adaptive land management to mitigate WUI fire risk and ultimately promote fire-safe communities and resilient ecosystems along the WUI-wildland gradient."

 Forest aboveground biomass (AGB) density mapping initiatives generally use one of three remote sensing approaches: lidar, radar, or near-nadir multispectral imaging leveraging machine learning methods, or a combination thereof. However, the active instrument record is limited and near-nadir multispectral imaging data are relatively insensitive to canopy physical structure. Multiangle imaging enables annual wall-to-wall mapping with a global record that extends back to 2000 as these data are highly sensitive to forest AGB. This paper describes work to validate estimates in a published annual, wall-to-wall record of forest AGB on a 250 m grid, derived using 672 nm imagery from the NASA, Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Multiangle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR) for 2000–2021, covering the southwestern United States. Estimates in the published MISR-derived annual forest AGB map series for the southwestern United States and the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) L4B Gridded 1 km AGB product were both found to be highly consistent with NASA Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) airborne lidar survey (ALS) AGB data. MISR and GEDI v.2 (v.2.1) estimates yielded similar coefficients of determination (∼0.7) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) (∼60 Mg ha−1) for all ALS data used. For the large CMS Sonoma County Improved AGB dataset, MISR and GEDI v.2 (v.2.1) estimates yielded R2 = 0.88, 0.88 (0.91); RMSE = 58, 40 (37) Mg ha−1. Estimates from MISR thus have an accuracy similar to that of the GEDI L4B gridded AGB product, with some limitations (e.g., topographic shading, tall, dense canopies). However the published MISR maps are on a 250 m grid, wall-to-wall, and cover the period 2000–2021. These results suggest MISR is able to provide a means to investigate trajectories of forest AGB change in the southwestern U.S. from 2000 onwards—over a substantial period of accelerating environmental and human- and climate-driven change– with reasonable precision."

 Faster, better, and more accurate burned area (BA) mapping is crucial for assessing the environmental and socio-economic impacts of wildfires. However, the diverse background disturbance, spectral variability, and extensive distribution of BAs pose significant challenges to their detection using Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery over large areas. Here, we developed a novel Moderate Spatial Resolution Burned Area Change Detection (MSR-BACD) framework, addressing these challenges through dataset development, model innovation, and inference optimization. Specifically: (1) we constructed a globally comprehensive MSR-BACD dataset, incorporating more than one million positive and negative samples (256 × 256 pixels) across diverse land cover backgrounds and cloud conditions to enhance model generalization; (2) we developed a specialized deep learning (DL) foundation model (custom Swin Transformer) leveraging dual-temporal (pre-and-post-fire) imagery to achieve precise BA delineation; and (3) we designed a candidate-based inference mode, collectively using the computational power and petabyte-scale RS data of the Google Earth Engine to generate BA candidates and the DL foundation model deployed on local GPU servers to filter out erroneous detections and delineate the BA extent, to improve detection efficiency significantly. Experimental results demonstrate that the MSR-BACD framework achieved a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 90.50 % in closed-set scenarios and outperformed existing moderate-resolution BA products in open-set evaluations in Portugal, increasing the Dice coefficient by 19.90 % while reducing computational costs by 95.62 % compared to traditional scene-by-scene exhaustive inference. These advancements highlight the MSR-BACD framework as a robust and efficient tool for regional-scale BA detection, contributing to wildfire science and application progress."

 Snow on sea ice strongly modulates growth, albedo, and air–sea exchange, but it also drives major uncertainties in altimeter-based thickness retrievals. This is critical for Ku-band radar altimeters (e.g., CryoSat-2, CS-2), whose waveforms integrate backscatter from snow-covered sea ice. Contrary to the common assumption that returns originate near the snow–ice interface, complex snow properties (roughness, layering, wetness, ice lenses) can shift effective scattering upward into the snowpack. We analyze Ku-band CS-2 satellite and Ka-band KAREN airborne waveforms over the Weddell Sea to partition contributions from the snow surface, snow volume, and ice surface. Using a physics-based Forward Backscatter Emulation Model (FBEM) and a CNN trained on simulated waveforms, we retrieve geophysical parameters and assess sensitivity to snow conditions. Under typical Antarctic conditions, snow-volume scattering contributes as much as, or more than, the snow–ice interface to CS-2 returns, while Ka-band is dominated by surface/near-surface snow scattering with minimal penetration to the ice surface. Wet snow further amplifies upper-layer backscatter. Sensitivity tests identify volume scattering and ice-surface roughness as primary controls on waveform shape. These results argue for explicit snow-volume terms in waveform models and support dual-frequency strategies relevant to ESA’s upcoming CRISTAL mission.

 The surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect, assessed through remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST), remains a focal point in urban climate research. Conventional indicators like SUHI intensity (SUHII) and footprint (SUHIF) capture peak values and spatial extent but fail to account for the cumulative thermal load—a critical dimension reflecting the total heat exposure imposed by spatially continuous warming, which directly limits a holistic assessment of ecological and societal impacts of the SUHI effect. Therefore, this study introduces an indicator termed SUHI capacity (SUHIC), designed to quantify the aggregated SUHI effect by integrating the magnitude of the warming signal across all affected areas, thereby enabling a more comprehensive evaluation of urban thermal environments. Furthermore, a direction-enhanced adaptive synchronous extraction (DEASE) method is proposed for the quantification of SUHIC. This method can dynamically identify the optimal background reference area based on the urban-rural LST gradients in various directions within the city, without relying on predefined mathematical models as previously. The results from 102 European cities first confirm that the directional variations in urban-rural LST gradients, and the DEASE method can effectively capture these distinctions for the simultaneous estimation of SUHII, SUHIF, and SUHIC. Secondly, the spatial patterns of absolute SUHIC values show strong associations with those of SUHIF (R2 > 0.86), while its relative values (normalized by the area of urban) align more closely with SUHII (R2 > 0.64). More importantly, SUHIC can serve as a crucial reference for assessing the urban thermal signal when SUHII and SUHIF diverge. The proposed method and framework contribute to standardizing the quantification of the SUHI effect."

 Climate-driven increases in wildfire frequency threaten forest resilience in fire-prone ecosystems. Although short-term studies indicate rapid recovery of eucalypt forests, such assessments may be overly optimistic, given the uncertain long-term alignment of structural and functional trajectories. This study integrated multi-source remote sensing data (2000−2020) with eddy covariance flux measurements to quantify post-fire recovery dynamics of eucalypt forests in southeastern Australia. We analyzed key structural metrics, including fraction of tree cover (FTC), the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and leaf area index (LAI), as well as functional traits, including gross primary productivity (GPP), solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), evapotranspiration (ET), fuel moisture content (FMC), and vegetation optical depth (VOD). On average, all these traits recovered to pre-fire levels within 5.5 to 7.5 years, though some areas required over a decade or more. Recovery trajectories diverged notably both between the structural and functional categories and among individual traits within each category. These recovery rates varied across forest groups, modulated by disturbance severity, understory compositions, and fire frequency. Notably, functional traits such as GPP and SIF recovered rapidly, surpassing even the fastest structural metrics. At the Wallaby Creek flux site (burned in 2009 and rebuilt), GPP and SIF exhibited a distinct “peak-decline-stabilize” pattern, surpassing pre-fire levels within three years before declining as LAI recovered. In contrast, structural metrics recovered gradually, with LAI lagging behind FTC and NDVI. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating multi-dimensional data to comprehensively assess forest recovery, offering critical insights for ecosystem management and carbon cycle modeling in fire-prone regions."

 High-quality and temporally continuous surface reflectance data are essential for remote sensing applications, but cloud contamination introduces severe spatiotemporal gaps in optical satellite image time series (SITS). Recent multi-modal approaches, integrating optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data with deep learning models, have advanced gap-free SITS reconstruction. However, several challenges remain. These include the reliance on external preprocessing to generate regular optical composite time series (e.g., 8-day intervals) and to temporally align SAR with optical data; insufficient modeling of the relationship between observation time series and their corresponding timestamps limits output flexibility, especially when generating predictions at any or user-specified time points; and reduced training and inference efficiency due to the incorporation of an additional modality (SAR). Collectively, these limitations hinder the practical applicability of current methods. To address the above challenges, this study proposes AnytimeFormer, a Transformer-based model for optical SITS reconstruction. First, AnytimeFormer accepts Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 observations along with their corresponding timestamps as input, and adaptively aligns temporally asynchronous multi-modal time series through a time-align attention module. Second, a low-rank fusion module is introduced to capture multi-modal information while preserving a lightweight architecture. Finally, a time-aware decoder enables the reconstruction of reflectance data at any user-specific time point. Extensive experiments conducted across eight globally distributed study sites, encompassing diverse land cover types and a range of cloud conditions, demonstrate the superior performance of AnytimeFormer (e.g., average RMSE: 0.03, R2: 0.95 at 80 % missing ratio) over benchmarks (HANTS, U-TILISE, STORI, RESTORE-DiT, et al.) under scenarios with different missing ratios and temporal pattern complexity. In terms of efficiency, compared to the suboptimal STORI, it reduces training time tenfold. Furthermore, the comparison with the Planet Fusion product shows a high consistency in temporal trends between the two and demonstrates AnytimeFormer's flexibility in reconstructing user-specified intervals. All the experiment results demonstrate that AnytimeFormer is a promising and practical solution for gap-free optical SITS reconstruction.

 Chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) is tightly linked to photosynthetic electron transport and informs gross primary productivity (GPP) across scales. Sun-induced ChlF (SIF) is typically retrieved at specific wavelengths (e.g., Fraunhofer lines, oxygen absorption bands) within a narrow field of view (solid angle), and given in power units. This spectral SIF radiance, denoted SIFλ, is not directly photosynthetically relevant, rather, it is the integrated radiant exitance, SIFint, expressed in molar units and integrated over 660–800 nm and the full angular domain, that corresponds mechanistically to photosynthesis. It is generally assumed that the SIFλ is proportional to SIFint and that this proportionality is spatially and temporally invariant. Here we tested this assumption with spectrally resolved SIF measured in three crop and six tree species at the leaf level. We found that while SIFλ is significantly related to SIFint at individual Fraunhofer lines, this relationship varies with wavelength and leaf chlorophyll content (LCC). We therefore developed a model to predict SIFint from SIFλ using wavelength and LCC as inputs. The model performed well across the ChlF emission band, particularly in the far-red region, enabling accurate conversion from observed SIFλ to mechanistically relevant SIFint. As an exploratory extension, the model was applied at the canopy scale for C3 and C4 crops with the Mechanistic Light Response model, yielding encouraging agreement between modeled and observed GPP.

 Accurate maps of cropland soil organic carbon stocks (SOCS) and clay content are essential for climate-smart agriculture. Soil reflectance composites (SRC), derived from multispectral bare soil observations, offer a scalable approach to high-resolution soil mapping. While studies often focus on maximizing model performance, challenges remain regarding (1) the bias introduced by masking and excluding soil samples during SRC generation and (2) the accurate representation of the full range and distribution of soil properties in the resulting maps. Evaluating different SRC parameters, we found that commonly used indices such as the Normalized Burn Ratio 2 (NBR2) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were significantly correlated with clay content and SOCS, respectively. These dependencies can lead to the systematic exclusion of high SOCS (>80 Mg ha−1) and clay (>30 mass%) samples during SRC generation, introducing bias in the resulting maps. Models trained solely on SRC bands failed to capture the full range of the training data, limiting the applicability of the soil property maps. While the inclusion of additional remote sensing features, such as spectral-temporal metrics and indices, significantly improved the prediction accuracy, the representation of the imbalanced samples remained challenging. We demonstrated that a combined framework of spatial data augmentation and majority undersampling was effective in improving the range and concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of the predictions (SOCS = 0.82; Clay = 0.9). Our findings emphasize the importance of (1) evaluating excluded samples to identify potential SRC-induced bias, and (2) optimizing model predictions reflecting the observed data range to improve the reliability and usability of the resulting soil maps."

 Current disaster and emergency management services produce flood maps within hours using satellite data. To handle large-scale events efficiently, a reliable automated method is needed to generate an initial flood extent map, which can then be refined manually.Launched in December 2022, the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite, equipped with the Ka-band Radar Interferometer (KaRIn), provides high-resolution radar observations used here for flood detection. While not initially designed for detailed flood mapping in vegetated or urban regions, the performance of SWOT’s Pixel Cloud products was assessed during four major flood events in Greece, France, Brazil, and the USA. Each event is paired with Sentinel-1 or Sentinel-2 imagery within a 3-hour time frame, providing a valuable opportunity to compare and evaluate SWOT’s flood detection capabilities.Three radar variables of the Pixel Cloud products are studied for extracting flood extents: σ0, coherent power, and interferometric coherence — which is computed from the two complex interferograms. They are compared to the built-in classification and flood masks computed from Sentinel-1/2. The study demonstrates the capabilities of the SWOT satellite in detecting flooded vegetation, flooded urban areas, and even regions with high snow cover. However, limitations are observed: (1) when high soil moisture is observed, causing signal saturation, (2) SWOT can be sensitive to the incidence angle, both of which lead to less reliable flood extent estimation. These findings highlight the potential of SWOT satellite for improving global flood mapping, as well as the need for further exploration to address current limitations and enhance flood monitoring capabilities in the near future."

 With the continuous advancement of global urbanization and industrialization, the pollution issue (e.g., light pollution) has become increasingly severe, posing a serious threat to the global dark sky quality. Evaluating the global dark sky quality and conducting site selection for potential dark sky parks not only contribute to the protection of natural ecosystems and the safeguarding of ecological security, but also provide scientific reference for sustainable ecotourism. Thus, our study integrated remote sensing nighttime light, cloud cover, and other data to develop a global dark sky quality identification based on the random forest model, effectively achieving interannual and seasonal dynamic identification of global dark sky quality. Then, the study defined global construction potential constraints and conducted site selection research for potential conventional dark sky parks and potential seasonal dark sky parks. The results show that in 2023, areas with high dark sky quality accounted for only 20.6 % globally, mainly distributed in high-altitude or arid regions worldwide, including the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, inland Australia, and other areas. From 2012 to 2023, global dark sky quality exhibited an interannual fluctuation pattern of “decline–rise–decline” and further showed significant seasonal differences. In addition, the identified potential conventional dark sky parks are mainly distributed in southern Africa, the southwestern United States, and other regions, while potential seasonal dark sky parks are mainly located in the Korean Peninsula, southern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and other areas.

 Accurate estimation of leaf spectral properties or biochemical parameters from canopy-level reflectance has long posed a significant challenge in quantitative remote sensing due to the inherent variability and complexity of canopy structures. This study presents 3D-Diff, an innovative differentiable three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer approach for retrieving leaf and soil spectral properties using remote sensing imagery with known 3D canopy structures. Implemented within the LESS (LargE-Scale remote sensing data and image Simulation) model, 3D-Diff employs computer graphics-derived differentiable modeling to compute reflectance derivatives relative to scene parameters during forward simulation. A gradient-based optimization algorithm then minimizes discrepancies between simulated and observed images to estimate scene parameters. Validations using both virtual experiments and real measurements demonstrated robust performance across varying parameter quantities. Notably, the results show that the reflectance/transmittance of all scene parameters were accurately estimated with maximum RMSE of 0.015 for virtual experiments, including non-directly-observed elements, and maximum RMSE of 0.096 for real measurements. Spatial resolution significantly affected accuracy, with relative RMSE values of 0.07 % (0.05 m) and 1.4 % (2.5 m) for a dense virtual forest scene. Although computationally slower than analytic models, this work establishes differentiable radiative transfer as a promising framework for fine-scale vegetation mapping, enabling simultaneous multi-parameter retrieval while maintaining physical interpretability."

 Mapping forest landscape fragmentation (FLF) after fires is essential for maintaining ecosystem balance, reducing fire-related losses, and minimizing environmental damage. However, the “salt-and-pepper” phenomenon complicates accurate FLF mapping at fine resolutions (≤ 10 m) in mountainous regions. To relieve the phenomenon, this study used the multi-vegetation index (MVI) to represent FLF and applied the Simple Non-Iterative Clustering (SNIC) algorithm to convert pixels into objects before classification, and then SNIC-MVI RF was introduced to map FLF using Sentinel-2 imagery and land use data. In combination with topographical and meteorological data, the Geodetector was employed to analyze the influencing factors on FLF patterns across different fire severity ranges. The results indicate that: (1) The proposed SNIC-MVI RF can accurately retrieve FLF across a range of fire severity using 10-m Sentinel-2 imagery while mitigating the “salt-and-pepper” phenomenon, with an average precision of 96.2 % and an average F1-score of 97.4 %. (2) The FLF spatial patterns exhibit significant differences across fire severity. Low fire severity (LFS) leads to an increase in the number of small patches, moderate fire severity (MFS) results in more complex patch edges, and high fire severity (HFS) promotes greater patch aggregation. (3) Pre-fire meteorological conditions and vegetation cover are major influences on the spatial patterns of FLF under different fire severities. This study will provide a new method for exploring the impact of different fire severities on FLF in central Yunnan. As an important indicator for assessing ecological disturbance and habitat degradation, analyzing the response of fragmentation to different fire severities can help administrators evaluate the impacts of fire on FLF more scientifically and develop more targeted and sustainable forest management and ecological restoration strategies."

 Flowers provide significant ecological and economic benefits. Despite rapid technological progress and broad availability of remote sensing data, flower detection and monitoring are still challenging because many phenological studies rely on vegetation indices (e.g., normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) which are not well-suited for flowers. Although some studies have focused on detection of flowering, the development and application of a comprehensive and robust remote sensing method for flowering remains largely unexplored. In this study, we introduce the flower color index (FCI) for detecting four major warm flower colors—red, pink, purple, and yellow—by leveraging remote sensing bands including blue (B), green (G), red (R) and near-infrared (NIR); these bands are widely available across a variety of remote sensing platforms. Here, we demonstrate the application of FCI across species representing a range of vegetation forms (herbaceous, shrubs, and trees) and study locations, corresponding to global biodiversity hotspots. We also tested FCI performance utilizing imagery with different spatial resolution—SkySat (0.5 m), PlanetScope (3 m), and Landsat (30 m). We show that FCI effectively detects and quantifies flowering events, which can be widely applied in ecology (e.g., flowering phenology, species identification, biodiversity conservation), agriculture (e.g., pollination management, yield estimation), and ecotourism (e.g., cherry blossom festival). Our proposed FCI has a simple formulation, is fast to calculate, and robust to different environments (urban or natural), spatial scales (spatial resolution and spatial extent), and background effects. Optimal FCI threshold—though variable across environments and settings—consistently lies on the right side of the distribution, facilitating automatic flower detection."

 Compound Hot and Dry Events (CHDEs), the co-occurrence of heatwaves (HWs) and dry events (DEs), are intensifying across Europe, heightening risks to human health, agriculture, and ecosystems. This study quantifies the spatiotemporal evolution, frequency, duration, and severity of CHDEs from 1980 to 2023 and identifies both persistent hotspots and emerging risk regions. A compound-event detection framework combining percentile-based HW thresholds (85th, 90th, 95th) with Effective Drought Index (EDI) metrics was applied to E-OBS daily data at 0.1° resolution for the warm season (May–September). Three indicators, frequency, total occurrence, and severity, were used to assess long-term trends and spatial variability. Vector analysis decomposed CHDE drivers, estimating the relative contributions of HWs and DEs. Results show a 35–45% increase in annual CHDEs after 2000, with severe 7-day events (95th percentile) rising by 2.7% per year. The Mediterranean basin (Iberia, southern France, Italy, Greece, western Turkey) remains the principal hotspot, while central and northern Europe (Germany, Poland, the Baltic region, southern Scandinavia) have experienced a three- to five-fold rise in frequency. Vector angles (mean ≈12°) and magnitudes indicate HWs as the dominant driver, with DEs amplifying risks regionally.

 Ocean remote sensing is essential for a wide range of marine applications, yet persistent cloud cover often introduces large spatiotemporal gaps that undermine data continuity and reliability. To address this challenge, we propose the Bayesian Field Convolutional Neural Network (BF-CNet), a probabilistic fusion network designed for cloud-affected reconstruction and forecasting. BF-CNet consists of two cooperating modules: the Uncertainty Feature Extraction Module (UFEM), built upon Bayesian Neural Fields, which performs pixel-wise posterior inference from cloud-free observations to reconstruct missing regions with quantified uncertainty; and the Spatiotemporal Inference Module (SIM), a ConvLSTM-based network that propagates these probabilistic representations through time for short-term forecasting. The two modules are trained sequentially within a cascaded framework. A hybrid loss function that combines per-quantile mean absolute error (MAE) and the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) is adopted to balance deterministic accuracy and probabilistic calibration. Furthermore, a comprehensive evaluation framework integrating deterministic (MAE, RMSE, PSNR, SSIM) and probabilistic (PICP, ECE) metrics is employed to jointly assess reconstruction fidelity and uncertainty reliability. Trained on datasets with physically realistic cloud masks, BF-CNet achieves substantial improvements over advanced baselines (e.g., cloud-region reconstruction MAE = 0.367, RMSE = 0.643, SSIM = 0.943, PSNR = 34.32 dB; ECE = 0.011), while maintaining computational efficiency and robust generalization across different oceanic variables.

Consequently, self-geolocation technologies are receiving more attention. This paper presents a self-geolocation method that completely eliminates the dependency on ground control points. The method uses images acquired during different orbits as inputs and leverages the geographic positioning consistency of corresponding points to calculate a sensor installation matrix without any need for control points. Initial experiments using simulated data revealed the method to be feasible.

 Mitigating volcanic eruption disasters is a key priority in Indonesia’s national development agenda. Due to the high density of active volcanoes near populated areas, even eruptions with a relatively low Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) can result in significant fatalities and losses. Therefore, rapid mapping of eruption impacts is essential both during and following an eruption. Machine learning with Earth Observation (EO) data enhances the speed and accuracy of volcanic impact mapping, critical for timely disaster response. In this study, we evaluate the performance of three machine learning classifiers − Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost – for mapping land surface changes resulting from volcanic deposits (e.g. lahars, pyroclastic density currents and lava) across three different data availability scenarios using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 optical data. Scenario I use a traditional approach, where training and validation data are sourced from the same eruption event. In Scenario II, the spatial transfer scenario, we simulate the absence of local training data by using data from different volcanoes. In Scenario III, the spatial–temporal transfer scenario, we include training data from past eruptions of the target volcano in addition to other events. Our results demonstrate that Scenario I achieve the highest classification accuracy, with Random Forest and XGBoost consistently outperforming SVM, achieving f1-scores exceeding 0.90. Scenario III improves average model performance compared to Scenario II (Δf1-score – 0.12), highlighting the value of historical eruption data for enhancing classification accuracy in data-scarce environments.

 Excessive groundwater pumping is a significant driver of land deformation, potentially threatening regional geological stability. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has been widely used to monitor such deformation. However, existing studies primarily focus on retrieving InSAR line-of-sight (LOS) or ground vertical deformation, limiting insights into three-dimensional (3D) ground displacements driven by subsurface processes. To address this, we propose a novel approach for modeling 3D surface displacement by integrating dual-orbit Multi-Temporal InSAR measurements with multiple prior deformation models. Specifically, we first estimate two sets of 3D displacements using a Bayesian approach by integrating dual-orbit InSAR measurements into prior models. Subsequently, bidirectional matching is employed to identify reliable homologous points, which are then used to reconstruct the complete horizontal displacement fields through the surface horizontal force equilibrium equation. Following the proposed methodology, for multi-track and high-coherence data, minimum acceleration (MinA) combination, multiple-aperture interferometry (MAI), and burst-overlap interferometry (BOI) techniques can serve as alternatives to conventional approaches. Moreover, incorporating along-track motion will further enhance 3D deformation estimation using SAR data. In the Lorca basin, Spain, we utilized Sentinel-1A ascending and descending SAR images to construct high-precision 3D cumulative displacement fields between October 7, 2015, to March 24, 2017. The experimental results reveal a maximum cumulative subsidence of 121.5 mm and notable horizontal displacements with a peak magnitude of 18.6 mm, a component that has received limited attention in earlier studies. The proposed approach eliminates the need for ground-based observations and yields improvements of 33.7 %, 51.3 %, and 43.9 % in the accuracy of vertical, east–west, and north–south deformation components, respectively, compared to the SMVCE method that integrates both InSAR and GNSS data. This study addresses the low sensitivity of InSAR in monitoring north–south displacement induced by groundwater extraction, offering new evidence to elucidate deformation mechanisms and providing valuable implications for sustainable groundwater management and geohazard mitigation."

 Spatiotemporal fusion is recognized as a feasible approach for reconstructing high spatiotemporal resolution remote sensing imagery. The recently proposed ROBust OpTimization-based (ROBOT) fusion model has attracted attention for its efficiency, accuracy, and simple parameterization, and has been applied to seamless global data cube reconstruction. However, its sliding-window strategy often leads to block artifacts, while cloud contamination in auxiliary images further degrade the reconstruction quality and reliability. To address these limitations, this study proposes an improved version of ROBOT (iROBOT). By replacing fixed rectangular patches with spectrally and spatially homogeneous segments, iROBOT effectively suppresses block artifacts and better preserves structural details. In addition, an adaptive gap-filling strategy is applied to temporally nearest auxiliary images prior to fusion, and a low-quality information detection module is introduced to filter unreliable cloud-contaminated data from the regression and residual allocation steps, thereby enhancing reliability under cloud contamination. A total of 28 experiments conducted across two representative areas demonstrate that iROBOT consistently outperforms ROBOT, OL-HSTFM, and FSDAF under both cloud-free and cloud-contaminated scenarios. Moreover, compared with ROBOT, iROBOT exhibits superior capability in selecting reliable information from multi-temporal auxiliary images, with its accuracy advantage becoming more pronounced as the number of auxiliary inputs increases, and with notably enhanced robustness in cloud-prone environments. These findings highlight the potential of iROBOT for improving the accuracy of global-scale spatiotemporal image reconstruction.

 Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a powerful proxy for vegetation photosynthesis. However, its broader application remains constrained by the insufficient understanding and quantification of canopy spatial heterogeneity. We used the 3D discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model to simulate SIF. Heterogeneous and homogeneous canopies were compared to quantify the impact of canopy spatial configuration on total leaf-emitted SIF (SIFtotal) and hemispherically integrated top-of-canopy SIF (SIFhemi). Angular effects were examined by comparing top-of-canopy SIF (SIFtoc) with SIFtotal estimated at different viewing angles. We also compared the relationships of simulated SIFtotal and SIFtoc with fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) and vegetation indices (VIs). In addition, we evaluated the relationships between the coefficient of variation (CV) of VIs and SIF, and developed a correction function for estimating heterogeneous-canopy SIF using homogeneous-canopy SIF. The results reveal that (1) both SIFtotal and SIFhemi are significantly higher in homogeneous than in heterogeneous canopies; (2) estimating SIFtotal from SIFtoc effectively reduces angular dependency; (3) SIFtotal exhibits the strongest correlation with fAPAR, while SIFtoc aligns better with NIRv and EVI; and (4) VI-derived CVs are negatively correlated with SIF, with CVNIRv and CVEVI at 10 m resolution demonstrating robust performance in fitting the ratio of heterogeneous-to-homogeneous canopy SIF, validating the proposed correction function. This study highlights the critical role of canopy structural heterogeneity in shaping SIF and presents an approach to convert homogeneous-canopy SIF to heterogeneous-canopy conditions, offering a novel pathway toward more accurate SIF estimation and application."

 Vegetation optical depth (VOD) based on microwave remote sensing has become an essential indicator for monitoring large-scale vegetation conditions. The relatively long-term record of satellite-based passive C-band observations offers the potential for assessing dynamic vegetation changes. Due to the limited operational lifetime of individual microwave sensors, retrieving a long-term C-band VOD (C-VOD) dataset often requires combining multiple sensors, such as Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS Aqua (AMSR-E, 2002–2011), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2, 2012–present) and WindSat (2003–2020). Retrieving a long-term C-VOD from their C-band brightness temperature (TB) observations faces two major challenges: (i) non-negligible systematic biases exist between the TB observations among the three sensors; (ii) TB from different sensors may not be strongly associated, especially in tropical forests with small seasonal variations. To address these challenges, we employed a combined inter-calibration method, using linear regression in sparse vegetation and linear rescaling in dense vegetation, to merge TB from three sensors. Results showed that: (i) in undisturbed dense forests where minimal emissivity variation can be assumed, the merged TB (2002–2022) exhibited strong temporal correlations with skin temperature (H polarization: R = 0.90, V polarization: R = 0.86); (ii) the merged C-VOD retrieved from the merged TB exhibited substantially improved temporal consistency across three sensors, reducing global discrepancies between AMSR-E and AMSR2 from 6.20 % to 0.34 %. Furthermore, the merged C-VOD showed stable long-term consistency across sensors, with paired t-tests indicating no significant differences (P-value > 0.01) at the global and vegetation-type scales, confirming reliable cross-sensor continuity; (iii) the merged C-VOD showed stronger temporal correlations with normalized difference vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, and site-level gross primary production across more vegetated areas globally, and exhibited higher and more stable spatial correlations with vegetation variables across sensor transitions compared to the existing merged C-VOD product."

 California experiences hundreds of wildfires each year, posing increasing risks to ecosystems and communities. This study investigates how hydrometeorological drivers influence wildfire occurrence and severity across four ecological zones from 2000 to 2023, using satellite imagery and in situ data. Complementary Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (CEEMD), Pseudo–Tri-Dimensional CEEMD, and Time-Dependent Intrinsic Correlation (TDIC) were applied to decompose short- and long-term variability, and Intensity–Duration–Frequency (IDF) curves were utilized to characterize event intensity and duration. Results show that wildfire severity has increased statewide even as occurrence rates diverged regionally. In the Sierra, the number of fires declined by approximately 25 %, yet the average daily burned area doubled, indicating fewer but more destructive events. In the North Coast, fire frequency decreased after 2010, but severity continued to rise, while the Central and South Coasts experienced more frequent ignitions that peaked around 2018. TDIC-based analysis revealed that wildfire occurrence decreases sharply with higher precipitation (≈ −0.7) and soil moisture (≈ −0.8), while hot and dry conditions strongly amplify fire activity, with temperature (≈ +0.8) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD; ≈ +0.6) emerging as dominant drivers. Vegetation greenness, measured by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), exerted contrasting effects: in the Sierra, dense summer biomass fueled larger fires once dried (+0.7), whereas in the South Coast, senescent grasses supported more ignitions (−0.8). IDF analysis further demonstrated that two- to five-day events often reached daily intensities exceeding 500,000 ha, while longer events accumulated greater total burned areas despite lower daily rates. These findings provide quantitative evidence that wildfire–climate interactions in California are region-specific and increasingly shaped by hotter, drier conditions, underscoring the need for adaptive fire management tailored to both short-term extremes and long-term fuel dynamics."

 Natural phenomena such as earthquakes and heavy rainfall can trigger landslide events hundreds or even thousands of times in a given area. Therefore, rapid and efficient intervention in affected regions is essential. Existing studies have demonstrated good detection performance using optical remote sensing images; however, optical data has significant limitations under cloud cover. Moreover, current multi-modal fusion methods struggle to effectively capture the nonlinear interactions between different modes when processing data with large informational disparities. To address these issues, we developed the China Luding multi-modal landslide dataset, which includes optical and polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images. We also propose a multi-modal network for landslide detection based on multi-label classification, called multi-modal cross Swin Transformer network (MCSTNet). Additionally, a new weighted asymmetric loss function (WASL) is proposed to improve multi-label classification tasks. Our proposed network consists of two stages: feature extraction and feature fusion. In the first stage, two independent branches extract high-level semantic features from optical and PolSAR images. In the second stage, a multi-modal cross multi-head self-attention (MCMSA) mechanism fuses the high-level semantic features from the multi-modal information. Therefore, the model enhances the learning and feature representation capabilities through parallel processing the input data information in different representation subspaces. Compared to other recent landslide detection methods, our results indicate that the proposed method is more effective, achieving an F1 score of 88.24% for landslide detection, with greater accuracy in identifying landslide-prone areas. Therefore, our model can provide reliable and effective decision support for disaster emergency responses."

 Rapid expansion of China’s aquaculture ponds (APs) has significantly contributed to food security and economic development, yet simultaneously triggering ecological degradation. However, the absence of high-resolution national datasets has constrained systematic analyses of APs’ spatiotemporal dynamics and their transboundary environmental footprints. To fill this gap, we developed a robust approach for accurately monitoring APs across China and elucidating the spatiotemporal dynamics and underlying mechanisms driving their changes. The Optical-SAR Aquaculture Pond Mapper (OS-APM) was developed, a novel framework integrating spatiotemporal-spectral signatures to synergistically leverage multi-sensor time series for precision AP mapping. The OS-APM comprised a hierarchical segmentation strategy for large-scale AP delineation, multi-modal feature fusion to distinguish spectrally ambiguous classes, and an ensemble classifier integrating optical, SAR, geometric, and topographic features. The framework achieved individual-pond-scale extraction accuracy (OA > 90 %) and generated China’s first 10-m resolution annual AP dataset (China_AP), derived from 119,882 Sentinel-1 and 579,436 Sentinel-2 scenes (2016–2023). This dataset revealed previously undocumented spatiotemporal patterns, indicating a 2023 AP inventory of 19,919.52 km2, with inland systems (55.56 %) now surpassing coastal ones (44.44 %) to dominate China’s aquaculture landscape. Spatially, four provinces (Jiangsu, Hubei, Shandong, Guangdong) collectively host 56 % of national APs, with 58 % clustered in the Yangtze-Huaihe River corridors. Temporally, the AP area exhibited an inverted-U trajectory, increasing from 20,685.20 km2 (2016) to a peak of 23,256.84 km2 (2019), then contracting below initial levels to 19,919.52 km2 by 2023. This reversal strongly correlates with China’s ecological civilization initiatives, notably the 2017 Aquaculture Water and Tidal Flat Plan. This study establishes multi-sensor data for national AP monitoring, quantifies inland AP expansion patterns under policy regulation, and delivers a scientific foundation for reconciling aquaculture intensification with wetland conservation."

 Arctic lake color and quality are changing in response to the warming climate, permafrost degradation, and intensifying disturbances. These changes have important implications on carbon and nutrient cycling, wildlife habitat, and water resources planning. However, the drivers, spatial distribution, and long-term trajectories of these changes remain poorly characterized on regional scales (∼100 km). In this study, we examined over 3,000 lakes in part of the Mackenzie Delta, Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands, and adjacent upland tundra in the Northwest Territories, Canada, to quantify both gradual and abrupt changes in lake color using harmonized Landsat time series from 1985 to 2022. Across the region, we found average declines of surface reflectance in the red and green bands by 13 % and 15 % over the last four decades, respectively. In comparison, the Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI) trends differed between sub-regions, with a decadal increase in the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands and a decrease in the Mackenzie Delta. We identified a positive, lagged correlation between abrupt lake color change and mean summer air temperature (MSAT), particularly in the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands (R = 0.7, lag = 2 years), indicating a delayed impact of warm summers on lake color. One important mechanism of such impact was lakeshore thaw slumping intensified by rising summer temperatures, with slump-affected lakes experiencing abrupt increases in surface reflectance and NDTI driven by sediment input. We identified fire as another important driver of lake color dynamics, which led to greater changes in lake surface reflectance (p < 0.01) and NDTI (p = 0.1) compared to surrounding lakes. These findings demonstrate the value of harmonized Landsat time series for characterizing multifaceted Arctic lake color dynamics, along with their drivers and impacts."

 Gaseous air pollutants pose significant threats to environmental quality and public health, with their diurnal variation patterns critically determining human exposure and health risks. However, the spatiotemporal dynamics and driving factors of these variations remain insufficiently understood at the national level. This study characterizes the diurnal variation of four key pollutants (SO2, NO2, CO, and O3), using hourly observations from 1636 monitoring stations across China spanning 2014–2024. By integrating a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) model with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), we quantified the non-linear contributions of meteorological, topographic, and socioeconomic drivers to pollutant variability, with the robustness of the results verified through spatial sensitivity analysis. The results reveal pronounced spatial and seasonal heterogeneity in diurnal ranges. Specifically, SO2 is shaped by the synergy of socioeconomic and meteorological factors; NO2 is dominated by socioeconomic intensity but amplified by plateau meteorology; CO is driven by high-frequency emission cycles such as traffic patterns; and O3 is strictly regulated by solar radiation and topography. These findings elucidate the distinct roles of emission intensity, atmospheric stability, and chemical processing in shaping diurnal cycles, underscoring the necessity of region-specific and time-targeted mitigation strategies to minimize population exposure and advance precision air-quality management."

 To advance the understanding of the characteristics and photochemical processes of VOCs in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), an intensive field measurement campaign was conducted at an island site (Da Wan Shan Island, DWS) in winter, using a proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS). A total of 133 VOC species were identified, with a mean total VOC mixing ratio of 8.2 ± 5.3 ppbv. Oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs), particularly CxHyO1 (55.0 %) and CxHyO2 (21.0 %) dominated the VOCs. Although the level of total VOCs was lower at DWS than that typically observed in the inland Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, distinct temporal and diurnal variations of VOCs were found in scenarios of different air masses (i.e., continental outflow (Scenarios A1 and A2) and marine air masses (Scenario A3)), which had undergone different degrees of photochemical processes. This indicated different photochemical evolutions and sources of VOCs. The source apportionment results of PMF with the input of initial (IC-PMF) and observed concentrations (OC-PMF) were compared to further evaluate the influence of photochemical consumption on the source apportionment results. We found that photochemical oxidation not only causes changes in VOC concentration and composition but also affects the source characteristics of VOCs. Through the IC-PMF results, vehicle + solid fuel combustion and liquid petroleum gas (LPG)-related emissions had higher contributions in continental outflow air masses of Scenarios A1 (12.6 % and 21.1 %) and A2 (16.9 % and 13.9 %), but only 3.3 % and 4.1 % in marine air masses (Scenarios A3), indicating that anthropogenic sources remain significant in PRD and PRE. Our study shows that outflow air masses from the PRD region has been through active photochemical processes, which can degrade the air quality over PRE, emphasizing the urgent need for mitigation of VOC emissions to reduce the photochemical pollution in this region."

 Odor and volatile organic compound (VOC) pollution were characterized through a 15-month mobile monitoring campaign (January 2024–March 2025) in the Tuoketuo Industrial Park, Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, an area experiencing frequent odor complaints. A portable multi-sensor odor analyzer was deployed across ambient routes, Priority Monitoring Zones (PMZs), and 52 Priority Regulated Enterprises (PREs), covering a total distance of 4072 km. The monitoring results indicated that mean odor unit (OU, dimensionless) values were higher in PMZs at night (10.2) than during the day (8.3) and on ambient routes (7.08). Seasonal peaks occurred in summer (July–August) and winter (December), corresponding to periods of low wind speeds and temperature inversions. Spatial analysis identified recurrent odor hotspots along J Avenue (night-time anomaly probability 65 %) and at the H Street–F Road intersection (48 %). Ammonia (NH3; peak 10 mg m−3), hydrogen sulfide (H2S; peak 7.85 mg m−3), and trimethylamine (TMA) were the dominant odorants, associated mainly with biopharmaceutical, coal-chemical, corn-processing and wastewater treatment activities. Although total VOC (TVOC) concentrations were low (0.11–0.15 mg m−3), odor activity values (OAVs) highlighted TMA and methanethiol (MM) as key contributors to perceived odor impact. These findings support targeted night-time enforcement in high-risk corridors and optimization of waste-gas treatment, and motivate the adoption of OAV-based odor management beyond mass-based TVOC metrics."

 Exposure to air pollution is associated with an increased risk of respiratory diseases (RD) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The abundant epidemiological evidence on the health effects of air pollution often focuses on individual pollutants, rather than complex mixtures of simultaneous exposure to multiple air pollutants. Traditional statistical approaches to investigate the effects of air pollution often predict the health outcome of a specific pollutant, and control for confounding by other pollutants. This is a limitation which could result in an underestimation of the health risks. Recently, the application of Machine Learning (ML) has been used to predict the health effects of complex air pollution mixtures. The aim of this study was to use unsupervised ML clustering methods to determine the joint effects of SO2, NO2, O3, PM2.5, and PM10 on hospital admissions for RD and CVD in the Vaal Triangle Airshed Priority Area (VTAPA), South Africa.Due to the missing air pollution from January 2011 to February 2020, data were imputed using the multiple imputation by chain equations (mice) method. K-means and spectral clustering methods were then applied to the air pollution data.A three-cluster spectral clustering model using the normalised Laplacian matrix, showed that the risk of RD hospital admission increased when exposed to SO2, NO2, PM2.5, and PM10 in higher concentration levels, and lower levels of O3 by 1.04 (95 % CI 1.01–1.08). No cluster models showed an increased risk of CVD hospitalisation.Although the clustering methods used in this study were quick to run and analyse, it is evident that more studies need to be done before considering unsupervised ML a reliable and definite tool to study joint effects of air pollution on different health outcomes."

 Microphysics parameterization strongly influences precipitation formation in numerical weather and climate models. This study evaluates three double moment microphysics schemes in the convection permitting WRF ARW model, including Jensen ISHMAEL (JIS), Thompson (TH), and WRF Double Moment 7 class (WDM7), for summer precipitation over Northwestern China using a 4 km simulation for 2009 to 2011. The evaluation, based on IMERG satellite data and surface observations, focuses on spatial distribution, diurnal cycle, hydrometeor structure, and thermodynamic conditions. All three schemes reproduce the major precipitation bands along the Tianshan, Qilian, and Kunlun Mountains, though with wet biases at high elevations and dry biases in the Tarim and Qaidam Basins. For diurnal variations, all schemes capture the characteristic double-peak cycle, with WDM7 providing the most accurate peak timing, TH performing moderately, and JIS showing a delayed, overly strong afternoon peak. Hydrometeor analysis shows that JIS and TH generate deeper, more continuous ice-phase layers in the mid- to upper troposphere, supporting persistent precipitation development. WDM7 produces noticeably weaker mid-level ice content, limiting sustained ice-phase growth. Thermodynamic responses indicate that JIS and TH modify local instability and moisture through stronger latent heating feedbacks, whereas WDM7 exhibits lower atmospheric moisture and instability and a higher lifting condensation level, creating conditions less favorable for deep convection.

This study proposes an analogue ensemble algorithm based on historical best-track data to quantify TC track uncertainties in the along-track (AT) and cross-track (CT) directions. The results reveal a strong latitudinal variation in the dominant direction of uncertainty: AT uncertainty is larger near the equator and within the mid-latitude westerlies, whereas CT uncertainty increases in recurvature zones. Moreover, the ratio of CT to AT uncertainty exhibits a negative correlation with TC translation speed. A comparable anisotropic pattern of track uncertainty is also identified in multi-model ensemble forecasts, indicating that the state-dependent preferred direction of position variability is a natural characteristic of TC track predictions. These findings provide the global-scale quantification of intrinsic anisotropic TC track uncertainty and highlight the importance of representing anisotropic uncertainty in probabilistic risk assessment and operational forecasting."

While stratospheric intrusion is regarded as an important source of surface O₃, its contribution to O₃ concentrations is typically small compared to local near-surface photochemical processes. However, a severe O₃ pollution event occurred in China’s Pearl River Delta region with O₃ concentrations increasing by 28.2 μg m−3 during September 2–4, 2024. Our Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model analysis indicates that the maximum contribution of stratospheric origin air masses can reach 71.0% due to a distant-source transport of stratospheric intrusion caused by super typhoon YAGI. Distinct from conventional localized stratospheric intrusion, this distant-source transport, driven by a typhoon and mid-latitude systems, enables vertical transport and horizontal delivery exceeding 2000 km, with typhoon-induced subsidence completing the grounding of stratospheric O₃. These findings reveal a new dynamic mechanism of vertical downward transport for stratospheric mass and underscore the necessity of joint prevention measures against stratospheric intrusion. Failure to elucidate the mechanisms against the backdrop of a projected increase in super typhoon events may lead to a severe underestimation of stratospheric intrusion contributions to tropospheric ozone pollution."

This enhanced propagation is facilitated by a zonal asymmetry in moistening during warm pool expansion. Moisture increases more rapidly over equatorial zone compared to off-equatorial regions over the western-central Pacific, near the east expanding boundary of the warm pool. As a result, the moistening rate preceding MJO convection, which is linked to the intensified equatorward moisture gradient, outpaces the growth rate of MJO amplitude, which depends on total column moisture there. This differential establishes more favorable thermodynamic conditions for eastward propagation of MJO events from the MC into the western Pacific under global warming. By the end of the century, the emergence frequency of MJO convection over the western Pacific is projected to rise by 36%. In consequence, the intraseasonal variations of precipitation extremes induced by the large-scale MJO convection over the western Pacific may become more pronounced in future climate scenarios."

Reductionistic understandings have tended to overemphasize livestock impacts and support restrictive interventions, which can ironically undermine synergistic relationships between pastoralism and biodiversity. Within a collectively-titled pastoralist landscape in Laikipia, Kenya, we built on long-term research to examine spatial relationships between locally-varying livestock use intensity and patterns of vegetation change over a 26 year period. We integrated remote sensing, field vegetation measurements, and pastoralist expert accounts of vegetation change to map vegetation transitions and their spatial distribution. We triangulated between multiple lines of inference, including classifications of vegetation community types and transitions, maps of varying livestock use zones and topography, qualitative analysis of expert explanations of vegetation change, and NDVI time series, to infer the contributions of grazing intensity and other drivers to the observed vegetation transitions. First, the most salient landscape change was the loss of two Euphorbia spp. in ∼22% of the study area; with elephants largely driving the loss of one species, and climate being a probable driver of loss of the other. Second, approximately 40% of the area experienced some degree of shrub encroachment. Spatial comparisons with livestock use zones indicated that shrub encroachment was more likely driven by fire suppression and/or climate. Third, there was ∼26% decrease of area supporting moderate or dense herbaceous vegetation cover. These decreases were primarily associated with increasing temperature, woody encroachment, and higher livestock pressure in areas that both formerly supported Euphorbia spp. canopies and also experienced year-round livestock use imposed through a conservation intervention. We recommend integrative triangulation between multiple epistemologies to understand how landscape changes in dryland ecosystems are driven by complex, interacting drivers such as spatio-temporal climate variability, megaherbivores, fire suppression, sedentarization, and changing livelihoods."

Here we examine compound weather systems based on environmental diagnostics of cyclones, fronts and thunderstorms applied to global reanalysis data for the first time based on multiple decades. Occurrence frequencies are mapped for each type of compound weather system from 1979 to 2020. Results for the double weather system types show that the cyclone and front combination mostly occurs in high-latitude ocean regions, whereas the cyclone and thunderstorm combination as well as the front and thunderstorm combination mostly occur in midlatitude land regions. The triple weather system type of the cyclone, front and thunderstorm combination is rare but tends to occur near the midlatitude east coast and adjacent maritime region of each continent. Thunderstorm-related compound weather systems have occurrence frequency maxima around 35° S and 35° N for ocean regions, with larger occurrence frequencies in the Northern Hemisphere than the Southern Hemisphere, whereas for land regions these occurrence frequencies are smaller in the Northern Hemisphere than the Southern Hemisphere. Long-term trends indicate more thunderstorm-related compound systems in some tropical land regions and midlatitude locations near the east coast of each continent, as well as changes in the Southern Hemisphere extratropics consistent with cyclones moving poleward. This dataset and methodology are also intended to be useful for future studies relevant to a range of disciplines, such as for insight on drivers of hazardous rain, wind and ocean waves through this framework of compound weather systems in regions through the world."

Vertical greenery systems (VGS) are increasingly promoted as nature-based solutions for space-constrained cities, yet their performance remains highly variable and context-dependent. This systematic review, conducted in accordance with preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines and synthesising evidence from 34 peer-reviewed studies, demonstrates that VGS hydrological efficacy is not a universal constant but is fundamentally moderated by local climatic conditions. Climate acts as the primary filter, shaping system function across tropical, temperate, Mediterranean, arid, and cold zones, each presenting distinct opportunities and constraints. Beyond climate, performance is refined by system typology (green façades versus living walls), plant functional traits (notably root architecture), and substrate composition, which together determine trade-offs between runoff delay, retention, and water quality improvement. The review further reveals a stark divergence in adoption barriers: in the Global North, high costs, regulatory complexity, and data gaps create institutional inertia, whereas in the Global South, limited awareness, misaligned priorities, and weak policy frameworks relegate stormwater management to a low priority. To address these challenges, we propose a five-pillar implementation framework centred on climate-responsive design protocols, advanced economic valuation of co-benefits, adaptive governance, long-term monitoring, and context-sensitive community engagement. This review provides actionable, evidence-based guidance for integrating VGS as resilient, equitable, and multifunctional components of sustainable urban water management, tailored not to global templates, but to local environmental and socio-institutional realities."

We developed a global wildland fire organic emission inventory (1997–2023) with full-volatility coverage using volatility-binned and chemically specific emission factors by vegetation type. Compared to the traditional POA + VOC framework, full-volatility organic emission inventories filled a gap of 25.1 Mt/year of I/SVOCs; grassland, tropical forest, boreal forest, peatland, and temperate forest fires contributed 66%, 13%, 11%, 6%, and 4%, respectively, to full-volatility emissions (averaged over 1997–2023). Southern Hemisphere Africa was the top emission hotspot, with full-volatility organic emissions of 4.4 t/km2/year, 1.3–6.9 times greater than the next highest-emitting emission hotspots: Northern Hemisphere Africa, Southern Hemisphere South America, and Equatorial Asia. On a global scale, wildland fire organic emissions are 79% of anthropogenic organic emissions, but their I/SVOC emissions are comparable. With a more comprehensive consideration of the mass and chemical speciation of full-volatility organics, this emission inventory could enhance our understanding of the impact of wildland fires on air quality and human health."

In natural circumstances, the concentrations and behaviors of the OPEs and PAEs are inevitably influenced by various environmental factors, but the driving mechanisms behind these are still unclear. This study focused on the main tributary of the Yangtze River basin: Chishui River. It quantified the contents and sources of OPEs and PAEs and integrated DOM and microbial characteristics to specifically analyze the key driving factors influencing pollutant levels. The results showed that the concentration ranges of OPEs and PAEs from Chishui River were 8.92 × 102–1.37 × 103 and 39.6–1.04 × 103 ng/L in water and 1.85 × 103–3.63 × 103 and 1.10 × 102–1.43 × 104 ng/g dry weight in sediment. TEP, DBEP, and DMEP were the main components requiring prioritized attention. These pollutants mainly originate from domestic waste and industrial plastics. The levels of the OPEs and PAEs were regulated by DOM adsorption and microbial degradation, respectively. Protein-like fluorophore at Ex/Em: 275/342 nm and FI jointly verified the wastewater source of TBEP. a253/a203 demonstrated potential for monitoring the concentration of TCrP. Tolerant Exiguobacterium exhibited potential for degrading PAEs. Optical signatures of the DOM served as potential tracers for monitoring the OPEs in environmental matrices.

Extensive studies have focused primarily on the chemical transformation of the volatile gases and secondary aerosol formation in wildfires, but organic aerosol evolution and its impacts on aged plumes remain poorly understood. Here, we performed laboratory multiphase oxidation of levoglucosan aerosol, the single largest primary organic aerosol component in wildfires, by hydroxyl radicals (•OH), and we quantified the oxidation products using thermal desorption chemical ionization mass spectrometry coupled with hydrogen–deuterium exchange. We show that levoglucosan undergoes unexpectedly rapid oxidation under atmospherically relevant •OH concentrations, driven by a combination of condensed-phase bimolecular autoxidation, ring-breaking reactions, and α-OH-peroxy radical unimolecular reactions. This chemistry efficiently produces highly oxygenated products and gaseous formic acid in high yields. These products have important implications for aged biomass burning aerosol composition and properties. Aircraft observations of western U.S. wildfires confirm rapid levoglucosan decay with kinetics consistent with laboratory results. The aircraft data suggest that levoglucosan oxidation explains 15–46% of the observed formic acid formation in aged wildfire plumes, representing a major hitherto unrecognized source. These findings reveal critical gaps in the current understanding of wildfire chemistry and highlight the important role of multiphase aerosol oxidation."

Here, we evaluate these biological cobenefits for 27 marine calcifiers whose calcification has declined under OA, by quantifying both historical OA-driven calcification losses and the potential of OAE to reverse them under scenarios with and without air–sea equilibration. Regression models describing calcification as a function of TA-DIC reveal substantial declines since preindustrial times, particularly in linear responders (mean 22%, range 7–44%), such as gastropods and pteropods, while threshold responders show minimal decline (∼3%). A realistic addition of 50 μmol kg–1 of OAE alkalinity restores species-specific calcification rates maximally only between 0 and 52.2%, with the largest benefits in OA-sensitive taxa. However, restoring preindustrial calcification requires far larger TA additions (mean 104 ± 58 μmol kg–1 without equilibration and more than triple this amount when equilibration with atmospheric CO2 is considered). While higher CDR efficiency enhances atmospheric CO2 drawdown, it simultaneously reduces the potential for biological OA mitigation. Thus, restoration of marine calcifiers through the OAE will not necessarily align with its climate goals, complicating its application in ocean management and CDR policy."

Linden,Far-UVC (222 nm) Suppresses Bacterial UV Resistance and Repair through Inhibition of DNA Repair Pathways,"Controlling pathogenic bacteria is essential for safe drinking water, but conventional UV disinfection can be compromised by bacterial DNA repair and radiation-resistant strains. This study demonstrates that microbial radiation resistance is fundamentally wavelength-dependent, established through a molecular-level understanding of DNA repair disruption. While conventional 254 nm UV (UV254) and far-UVC 222 nm (UV222) induce comparable DNA damage at practical fluences (20–50 mJ/cm2 ), UV222 uniquely suppresses repair through wavelength-specific protein targeting and damage. UV222 enhances protein absorption by 2.58-fold and amino acid photolysis quantum yield and then directly photolyzes substitute repair enzymes, leading to protein fragmentation with almost complete enzymatic inactivation (>95%) compared to UV254. This targeted proteome damage systematically dismantles repair pathways, with recA, the master regulator of DNA repair, experiencing >90% transcriptional suppression under UV222, contrasting with significantly elevated expression under UV254. Genetic validation using recA-deficient mutants confirms this pathway-specific vulnerability. UV222-induced protein damage likely mediates inhibition of DNA repair, preventing genomic restoration. This repair suppression mechanism enables UV222 to overcome UV254-resistant bacteria such as Deinococcus radiodurans and produces multitime scale disinfection in tap water, achieving both immediate inactivation and regrowth prevention. These findings advance understanding of wavelength-dependent UV resistance and bacterial DNA repair processes, providing new insights for improved UV disinfection methods."

Catalytic decomposition into O2 is widely considered to be a promising technology for O3 pollution elimination in the ambient environment. Unfortunately, developing a catalyst with high activity and moisture resistance, as well as applications through a facile approach, remains a huge challenge. In this study, we synthesized an excellent, active, and stable NiO catalyst with double active sites of hydroxyl groups and oxygen vacancies for catalytic O3 decomposition. The simple NiO catalyst exhibited nearly 100% conversion of 40 ppm of O3 within 100 h at a space velocity (600 L g–1 h–1) and 50% RH, suggesting exceptional chemical stability and water resistance over a long time. The hydroxyl groups in NiO directly bonded with O3, inducing the reconstruction of NiO to form a new intermediate reactive species (NiOOH) and facilitating the involvement of H2O molecules in the reaction, thus inhibiting the negative effects of moisture. Meanwhile, the coexisting oxygen vacancies effectively regulated the local electronic structure near Ni to promote the release of intermediate species and increased the number of active sites, resulting in dramatically enhanced catalytic O3 decomposition. The mechanisms of catalytic O3 decomposition were elucidated, underlying the hydroxyl groups cooperating with oxygen vacancies, with the combined in situ DRIFTS, Raman, EXAFS, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

A common outcome of plant stress is increased emissions of acyclic terpenes. The paucity of information about acyclic terpene SOA chemistry contributes to uncertainties in predictions of SOA global loadings and impacts on Earth’s radiative budget, particularly in a changing climate where acyclic terpene emissions could become more prominent. This study compared properties of SOA derived from hydroxyl radical (OH) oxidation of acyclic and cyclic monoterpenes (β-ocimene, α-pinene) and sesquiterpenes (β-farnesene, β-caryophyllene). Single-particle mass spectrometry was used for assessing shape, density, and evaporation kinetics of size-selected SOA particles, and nanospray desorption electrospray ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry (nano-DESI-HRMS) was used to measure the molecular composition of SOA. Acyclic terpene SOA exhibited higher viscosity and lower volatility compared to cyclic terpene SOA, and had a greater volume fraction remaining (VFR) after ∼24 h of evaporation─approximately 1.3–1.6 times higher VFR than that of cyclic terpene SOA. Additionally, HRMS analysis revealed greater chemical diversity and higher fractions of extremely low-volatility compounds (56–62% ELVOC/LVOC) in acyclic terpene SOA compared to cyclic counterparts (25–37% ELVOC/LVOC). Our findings highlight the potential importance of accounting for acyclic terpene aerosol chemistry under conditions of plant stress to improve predictions of SOA loadings and impacts."

Recent studies have observed unexpectedly strong aerosol absorption on the TP, leading to positive direct aerosol radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere (DARFTOA) and potentially accelerating TP warming. However, light absorption by different aerosols remains poorly quantified, especially when considering the influence of dark-brown carbon (d-BrC), which exhibits characteristics similar to black carbon (BC). Based on size-resolved aerosol chemical compositions and optical properties measured on the TP, this study proposes a novel framework to derive aerosol absorption contributions by BC, the lensing effect, methanol-soluble organic aerosols (MSOA), and d-BrC. Contrary to expectations, approximately 50–70% of aerosol absorption across the 405–780 nm wavelength range is attributed to d-BrC in Lulang and Lhasa, rather than BC. DARFTOA changes from +2.83 to −0.42 W/m2 when absorption by d-BrC is excluded. These results reveal that d-BrC is a key factor determining aerosol warming or cooling effect on the TP, and it should be incorporated into weather and climate models for improving the assessment of aerosol radiative forcing."

We analyze the impact of small‐scale initial perturbations on updraft velocity and supersaturation, and determine the ensemble size required to minimize stochastic internal variability. Results show that minor thermodynamic perturbations can produce updraft variability comparable to aerosol‐induced changes reported in prior work. An ensemble of 10 members sufficiently reduces variability, enabling robust investigation of aerosol‐related updraft invigoration and informing the design of future ensemble‐based aerosol‐convection interaction studies in environments with significant spatiotemporal mesoscale thermodynamic and aerosol heterogeneity."

Using reanalysis data, we identify 54 Chaco jet events and categorize them based on antecedent soil moisture over northern Argentina; 63% occur under drier‐than‐normal conditions. Dry soils are associated with enhanced surface sensible heating, lower‐tropospheric warming, and a deepened thermal low, which intensifies the Chaco jet (2.8 times stronger than in wet cases) during the 5 days before its peak. These results highlight the importance of land‐atmosphere interactions in modulating SALLJ dynamics and suggest that antecedent soil moisture information could improve jet forecasts in the region."

Using reanalysis data and a theoretical framework that separates the deep and shallow convective modes, we quantify their individual and combined contributions to energy and moisture transport. Results show that deep mode GDS and GQS are strongly correlated with sea surface temperature (SST). In contrast, GMS is much smaller and exhibits weaker SST dependence, particularly when the shallow mode is included. The deep mode generally stabilizes the atmosphere through moist static energy export, whereas the shallow mode destabilizes it through moist static energy import. When combined, GMS is positive over convective regions but negative or near‐neutral over subtropical oceans and cold tongue, and its spatial distribution closely corresponds to observed Madden–Julian Oscillation activity."

Accurate subseasonal forecasts depend on reliable MJO prediction, and recent artificial intelligence (AI)‐based models have shown great promise for enhanced prediction of MJO index. However, existing AI models have used only MJO anomalies as input data, overlooking the broader atmospheric context such as seasonal and interannual variability. Here, we present a new deep learning framework that explicitly incorporates background fields as inputs together with MJO anomaly variables. Through the multi‐scale decomposed inputs, our model improves the MJO prediction skill up to 26 days in boreal winter and 29 days in boreal summer. The detailed model interpretation analyses reveal the important role of background information in long‐range MJO forecasts, highlighting utilizing background fields in the development of next‐generation sub‐seasonal forecasting models, which could help advance global weather predictability and disaster preparedness."

DCAPE is projected to increase by 5%–12% on average in most areas, independently of wind shear. A diagnostic of downdraft buoyancy is introduced to understand the mechanisms of DCAPE responses. Much of the increase in mean DCAPE is temperature‐driven, with additional contributions from changes in relative humidity and downdraft origin heights. However, extreme values increase at much faster rates than can be explained by local warming. In winter, the latitude of significant DCAPE and CAPE shifts poleward by more than 5° due to larger changes in downburst environments within midlatitude cyclones. The projected increase in cold‐season extremes indicates an interaction between weather events and warming trends that increases the potential for downbursts and straight‐line winds in winter."

We specifically compare our control simulations (CTL) of TC development to sensitivity tests that exclude cloud‐radiative forcing (NCRF) either everywhere or just within specific cloud types. Our experiment and analysis indicate that CRF leads to fewer and weaker stratiform downdrafts and greater humidity and moist entropy in the developing TC core, implying suppressed ventilation, with stratiform and anvil CRF dominating this effect.

 Hailstorms producing hail larger than 5 cm cause the most severe damage to property and infrastructure, often leading to multibillion-dollar losses. Here we develop a global climatology of these very large hail events from 1950 to 2023 by combining statistical modelling with atmospheric reanalysis and examine trends in their frequency and related economic impacts. Northern Argentina emerges as the global hotspot of very large hail events, followed by Uruguay, Paraguay, southern Brazil, the US Great Plains and South Africa. Asia—and to a lesser extent, Europe and Australia—show substantially lower frequencies. Europe is seeing the sharpest rise in the frequency of very large hail events, driven by increasing low-level moisture and atmospheric instability. By contrast, the Southern Hemisphere—especially South America—is experiencing notable declines, linked to reduced mid-level humidity and instability. Hail-related losses have increased in the USA, Australia and Europe. In Europe, the rise is mainly due to more frequent very large hail events, whereas in the USA and Australia, increasing exposure and vulnerability are the primary drivers. These contrasting regional trends in hail frequency and related losses underscore the need for tailored risk management strategies that account for both climatic drivers and socio-economic vulnerabilities.

 Precipitation remains one of the most challenging climate variables to observe and predict. Existing datasets face intricate trade-offs: gauges are relatively trustworthy but sparse, satellites provide near-global coverage with retrieval uncertainties, and numerical models offer physical consistency but are biased. Here we introduce PRIMER (Precipitation Records Infinite MERging), a framework that fuses these complementary sources. PRIMER employs a coordinate-based diffusion model that learns from arbitrary spatial locations and associated intensity values, enabling seamless integration of gridded data and irregular gauge observations. Through two-stage training—first learning large-scale patterns, then refining with gauge measurements—PRIMER captures both large-scale structure and local precision. Once trained, it can correct biases in existing datasets—yielding significant error reductions at most gauge sites—and downscale reanalysis. In addition, by combining background estimates with extra gauges, it produces analysis fields that further reduce errors. All tasks are achieved through posterior sampling utilizing the prior obtained by fusing multi-source records. Crucially, it generalizes without retraining, correcting biases in operational forecasts and downscaling future scenario precipitation fields. This demonstrates how PRIMER can transform imperfect data into a source of strength. This study presents PRIMER, a coordinate-based diffusion model, that fuses multiple imperfect precipitation records into a unified prior, enabling Bayesian inference like downscaling, bias correction, and data assimilation."

This study systematically investigates the evolution of shipping CO2 emissions associated with countries’ maritime export trade from 1995 to 2021 using a trade-driven approach and evaluates disparities in national emission patterns. Results show a shift from a high-income dominance toward a more balanced distribution, with growing contributions from upper-middle-income and emerging economies. While the global average GDP-normalized shipping emission intensity declined by 33.6% during the study period, substantial variations exist across economies. Middle-income countries once exhibited nearly twice the GDP-based emission intensity of high-income economies, but this gap has narrowed with economic diversification. Per capita shipping emissions saw only modest growth globally, yet differences across countries remain pronounced. High-income countries account for over half of global emissions despite representing only 15% of the world’s population, maintaining persistently above-average per capita levels. Major emitters─including the United States, Australia, Brazil, and China─show striking contrasts: Australia records both GDP- and population-normalized intensities well above the global average, whereas China’s values fall below it, underscoring structural inequities in the distribution of the shipping-related carbon burden. These findings highlight persistent disparities in maritime emissions and underscore the need for a differentiated, multimetric framework to guide equitable responsibility allocation."

China’s pursuit of carbon neutrality and air quality goals should ideally promote the convergence of both national mitigation targets and regional equitable transition, but the two are rarely considered together. Here, we develop an environmentally extended multiregional input-output model for China, which covers multiple environmental impacts for three benchmark years, to investigate the performance of national CO2 and air pollutant reductions and the evolution of regional inequality. We present the realistic evidence that regional inequalities have worsened alongside China’s accelerating transition toward low-carbon and clean-air goals. International and interregional supply chains have jointly exacerbated the uneven distribution of economic benefits and environmental burdens, trapping the Northwest region, such as Xinjiang and Ningxia, in a lose–lose situation. Production efficiency improvement and consumption structure optimization can be promising ways to synergistically achieve national emission reductions and regional inequality alleviation, with the East Coast region (Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu) currently leading these ways. We advocate incorporating regional equitable transition into policy-making for CO2 and air pollutants coabatement, which will facilitate an inclusive green and clean development for China and other countries facing similar challenges."

In this study, three types covering nine HWs events were identified during summer 2023 (June–August) in Beijing, including daytime HWs (DHWs, 4 days), nighttime HWs (NHWs, 8 nights), and compound HWs (CHWs, 27 days). Twenty-eight days of O3 pollution (OP) occurred during the whole summer, among which 64% (18 out of 28) appeared during HWs. HWs elevated O3 concentrations by 27.3% comparing to non-HWs, while CHWs significantly amplified diurnal O3 fluctuations accompanied by the accumulation of reactive nitrogen (NOx, NOz, and NOy), indicting a stronger tendency toward O3-reactive nitrogen combined pollution. During HWs, NOx/NOy ratios were reduced, and secondary oxidized nitrogen NOz levels were elevated, which accelerated photochemical O3 production and promoted VOC-driven chain reactions, thereby intensifying and prolonging O3 pollution. O3 suppression was observed at temperatures of ∼38 °C, indicating a nonlinear and complex influence of HWs on the O3 formation. This work elucidates synergistic O3-reactive nitrogen transformation mechanisms under extreme HWs, providing a scientific foundation for refined regional pollution modeling and precision mitigation strategies."

Among current control strategies, Cu-exchanged SSZ-13 (Cu/SSZ-13) catalysts are widely recognized for their excellent low-temperature NH3-SCR activity and hydrothermal stability. However, their real-world performance is limited by sulfur poisoning, which deactivates active Cu sites through the formation of Cu-S species. Previous regeneration methods often result in incomplete recovery due to the formation of stable sulfates and/or insufficient redispersion of active Cu ions. In this study, we demonstrate that regeneration of sulfur-poisoned Cu/SSZ-13 in an inert atmosphere (Ar) at 800 °C can effectively prevent the oxidation of metastable Cu-S species into stable sulfate species while also promoting the decomposition of Cu-S species, thereby enabling a more complete recovery and redistribution of Cu ions into the zeolite framework. What is particularly noteworthy is that this regeneration method not only recovers the catalyst’s functionality but also leads to a significant enhancement in low-temperature NH3-SCR efficiency, outperforming the fresh catalyst. Advanced microscopic and spectroscopic analyses reveal that this enhancement is associated with increased formation of [ZCu2+(OH)]+ species located in the 8-membered rings of SSZ-13, which are known to be the most active sites for low-temperature NH3-SCR."

Third-party commercial testing and peer-reviewed studies alike typically report inactivation metrics in terms of percent- or log-reductions observed from chamber experiments that imply a nearly complete elimination of infection risks. However, these metrics are highly dependent upon the experimental volume and duration, so they do not directly translate to actual effectiveness indoors. We reviewed 45 experiments across 14 published studies and converted reported reduction metrics into equivalent clean airflow rates (ECA). Different studies yielded distinct ECA distributions, suggesting that differences in experimental procedures, device specifications, or environmental conditions may be more important ECA determinants than the target pathogen or the underlying device technology. Study-averaged ECAs spanned between 1.4 and 134 m3/h, with the median study having an average ECA = 31 m3/h. Even small off-the-shelf HEPA-filter air cleaners typically provide ECAs that exceed the best-performing additive devices analyzed herein.

Studying particle phase states from specific ambient source types is often challenging due to uncontrolled environmental conditions and multiple source contributions. However, a historic Pacific Northwest wildfire event occurred in September 2020, providing a rare opportunity to study a pseudosingle particle type ambient sample (i.e., wildfire) over time. Sampling was performed in Richland, Washington, capturing aged particles from shifting wildfire sources. In addition to source variability, temporal variation in individual particle phase state was observed. Despite this, single particle elemental compositions were homogeneous over time (≥87% carbonaceous) with no appreciable temporal variation in organic functional group abundances within individual particles either (e.g., 4% relative standard deviation in alkene contributions). While particle composition is indeed known to affect phase state, water uptake appeared to be the most important contributor to phase state variability among single particles here, as particle aspect ratios (related to phase state) linearly correlated with ambient relative humidity during sampling (R2 = 0.65). Therefore, while limited to a case study, meteorological considerations are found to convey greater comparative importance than particle composition for aged particle phase state predictions."

Martian paleoclimate models, however, have difficulty simulating climate conditions warm enough to maintain liquid water on early Mars. Reconciling the geologic record and paleoclimatic simulations of Mars is critical to understanding Mars' early history, atmospheric conditions, and paleoclimate. This study uses an adapted lake energy balance model to investigate the connections between Martian geology and climate. The Lake Modeling on Mars for Atmospheric Reconstructions and Simulations (LakeM2ARS) model is modified from an Earth‐based lake model to function in Martian conditions. We use LakeM2ARS to investigate the conditions necessary to simulate a lake in Gale crater. Working at a localized scale, we combine climate input from the Mars Weather Research & Forecasting general circulation model with geologic constraints from Curiosity rover observations to identify potential climatic conditions required to maintain a seasonally ice‐free lake. Our results show that an initially small lake system (10 m deep) with ∼50 mm monthly water input and seasonal ice cover would retain seasonal liquid water for over 100 years, demonstrating conditions close to long‐term lake survivability. These results are an important step in resolving the historic disconnect between climate and geology on Mars. Continued use and iteration of LakeM2ARS will strengthen connections between Mars' paleoclimate and geology to inform climate models and enhance our understanding of conditions on early Mars."

Here, we systematically quantified the relative contributions of these drivers and demonstrated that precipitation has historically been the dominant driver, followed by temperature. Under climate warming, however, precipitation's contribution is declining while temperature's role is becoming increasingly prominent. Despite inter‐model uncertainties, the multi‐model ensemble mean indicates that temperature is projected to surpass precipitation as the dominant driver in the majority (>15) of the 27 analyzed regions. An earlier transition (generally before 2060) is projected for regions including western North America, northern Asia, southeastern Asia, and central Africa.

However, the causality between these stratospheric and tropospheric extreme events remains unclear due to the rarity of such downward coupling during Southern Hemisphere (SH) winter—previous Antarctic stratospheric warmings and their associated downward coupling have largely occurred during SH spring. Here we provide insights into the dynamics and climate impacts of wintertime Antarctic vortex variability during 1979–2023 and compare the climatological behavior of wintertime SH stratosphere‐troposphere coupling with that observed during mid‐winter 2024. During 1979–2023, compared to the springtime stratospheric polar vortex variability in the SH, which is characterized by variations in vortex strength and breakdown timing and its robust signature in surface climate, wintertime variability in the SH stratospheric circulation is marked by expansion and contraction of the vortex with generally weak linkages to surface circulation. The 2024 mid‐winter event mirrored many historical features of wintertime variability at stratospheric levels but had a much stronger signature in surface climate. It was unique with a record contraction of the vortex accompanied by record increases in polar stratospheric temperatures for July. These unusual stratospheric conditions atypically led to substantially higher‐than‐normal Antarctic ozone concentrations in July and August, delaying the development of the ozone hole, and record negative values in the SAM and extraordinary warmth over the Antarctic continent in early August 2024."

The results reveal that as the injection latitude shifts closer to the North Pole, Arctic sea ice rapidly recovers in both its extent and volume. This recovery is driven by coordinated shifts in clear-sky and cloud-related radiation, along with changes in surface reflectivity, that collectively reshape the surface energy balance in favor of ice growth. Importantly, we also find that, under fixed SAI injection rates, Arctic sea ice recovery varies substantially with injection latitude and does not scale directly with global mean surface temperature."

 This study identifies atmospheric rivers (ARs) as key mediators linking large-scale climate teleconnections, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific-North American pattern (PNA), and Arctic Oscillation (AO), to variations in vegetation activity (NDVI) and burned area (BA) across North America. The results highlight the central role of ARs in shaping regional fire regimes and improving prospects for seasonal fire prediction. Distinct spatial and lag-dependent responses emerge: ENSO-driven precipitation promotes vegetation greening in northwestern Canada at longer lags, whereas browning dominates Alaska and northeastern Canada. The PNA exerts a dominant influence, suppressing NDVI across the eastern United States and central Canada at longer lags, while promoting greening in Alaska at shorter ones. AO effects often counter those of ENSO, driving vegetation drying in the southern United States and southwestern Canada at short lags, and in central Canada and Alaska at longer timescales. ARs exert a strong control over burned area, particularly across northern Canada and Alaska. When AR variability is incorporated, much of the fire enhancement previously attributed to teleconnection phases is reversed, indicating that AR-teleconnection interactions play a pivotal role in modulating the timing and magnitude of vegetation and fire responses across North America.  The interactions between atmospheric rivers and large-scale climate teleconnections modulate the timing and magnitude of vegetation and fire responses across North America, according to remote sensing, teleconnection index, and reanalysis data analyses."

 The timing of leaf senescence critically shapes ecosystem dynamics by regulating plant productivity and nutrient cycling. While species diversity is recognized as a key driver of ecosystem functioning, its effect on autumn senescence remains poorly understood. To address this gap, here we integrated field observations from Northern China and global remote sensing data to investigate grassland autumn senescence. Our analyses reveal that higher species diversity accelerates autumn senescence, even after controlling for climate and soil factors. Mechanistically, this relationship is mediated by resource allocation strategies: enhanced species diversity promotes the allocation of resources to belowground biomass, thereby reducing aboveground resource availability and triggering earlier senescence. Our findings highlight a negative relationship between species diversity and the timing of autumn senescence in semi-arid grasslands, which facilitates increased carbon allocation to belowground compartments and accelerates the seasonal carbon cycle, offering critical insights into global carbon flux exchange under future climate warming. Enhanced species diversity promotes the allocation of resources to belowground biomass, accelerates seasonal carbon cycle, thereby reducing aboveground resource availability triggering earlier senescence, according to field observations from Northern China coupled with global remote sensing data."

 Autumn leaf fall is a critical phenological event in temperate deciduous forests, with important ecological and socioeconomic implications. Traditional estimates based on daytime vegetation indices primarily capture foliage color changes rather than the actual timing of leaf fall, and are often affected by mixed-pixel effects that reduce the accuracy. This study proposes a novel workflow for detecting the autumn leaf fall date (LFD) using nighttime light (NTL) data in urban areas, validated through in-situ observations from phenological cameras and city-scale assessments. Results showed that NTL-derived LFDs closely matched in-situ observations across three cities (New York City, Boston, and Beijing), with an RMSE of around 5 days and a bias of 0.77 days. In Beijing, both interannual (2012–2024) and spatial variations (2024) in LFD were delayed by higher preseason temperature and precipitation but advanced by greater strong-wind frequency, consistent with known autumn phenological controls and supporting the reliability of the NTL-based approach. These results demonstrate that NTL data can provide more accurate and interpretable LFD estimates than traditional daytime remote sensing, enabling detailed city-scale mapping. The use of NTL-derived LFD dynamics facilitates a more comprehensive understanding of their spatiotemporal patterns in urban environments and their linkages to climate change and human activities."

 Black Carbon (BC), generated mainly by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, reduces snow albedo by increasing solar radiation absorption, which enhances surface warming and accelerates snow ablation. This effect is particularly relevant in snow-dominated basins near emission sources. However, limited atmospheric and depositional BC measurements restrict the assessment of its spatial and temporal variability in mountain catchments. This study estimates past (2006–2022) and future (2023–2035) atmospheric BC levels in the Juncalillo River basin, Central Andes of Chile. BC concentrations in snow (BCCS) were inferred using an asymptotic radiative transfer model (ART) and subsequently used to estimate atmospheric BC through a statistical model. Future BC was projected under two contrasting scenarios: (1) climate change conditions using the IPSL-CM5A-MR GCM with Quantile Delta Mapping, and (2) increased vehicular traffic on the CH-60 road (primary emission source in the basin). BCCS ranged from 160 to 520 ng g−1, with 11–20 % higher values within 1 km of the road. Atmospheric BC in 2006–2022 averaged 0.12 μg m−3 at the basin scale, with a non-significant increasing trend. Climate change projections suggest reduced BC (mean 0.10 μg m−3) with a significant negative trend, whereas the traffic-based scenario predicts an increase to 0.21 μg m−3 and a significant positive trend. These contrasting outcomes highlight the need to explicitly consider BC emission sources when evaluating future cryosphere changes in mountain basins."

 Monitoring carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration is considered an effective approach to controlling greenhouse gas emissions. Simulating CO2 concentration variations using atmospheric chemistry models can compensate for the spatial and temporal limitations of ground-based and satellite observations. In this study, the WRF-Chem (Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry) model was employed to simulate CO2 concentrations over central and eastern China from 2019 to 2021. The reliability of the simulation results was verified through comparisons with satellite data from OCO-2 (Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2), OCO-3 (Orbiting Carbon Observatory 3), and GOSAT (Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite). Additionally, the results were validated against observational data from TCCON (Total Carbon Column Observing Network) and WDCGG (World Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases). The RMSE of the WRF-Chem simulation results compared to TCCON and WDCGG station observations were 2.146 ppm and 2.239 ppm, respectively, with R of 0.716 and 0.825. When compared to OCO-2, OCO-3, and GOSAT satellite observations, the RMSE were 2.000 ppm, 2.080 ppm, and 1.827 ppm, respectively, with R values of 0.792, 0.831, and 0.837. Based on a comparative analysis integrating WRF-Chem simulations from 2009 to 2021, this study reveals an upward trend in XCO2 concentrations over China, with an average annual growth rate of approximately 2.0 to 2.5 ppm. Although the growth rate slowed during 2019 to 2020, likely influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, concentrations continued to increase annually. This result indicates that short-term variations in anthropogenic emissions can moderate the rate of increase but do not alter the long-term trend. The consistency between simulated CO2 concentrations, MEIC inventory emission trends, and ground-based observations further validates the simulation accuracy and suggests the reliability of MEIC in characterizing China's carbon emission changes during the pandemic."

 The Arctic Oscillation (AO), the dominant mode of extratropical Northern Hemisphere circulation, is known to influence midlatitude climate variability, but its impacts on tropical rainfall–particularly over the Maritime Continent (MC)–remain unclear. Here, we examine the influence of the boreal spring AO on midsummer (July–August) MC precipitation during the period 1979–2023. The results reveal a significant negative relationship between midsummer MC precipitation and the preceding March–April AO. Further examination identifies a physical mechanism linking the two: during the negative phase of the March–April AO, atmosphere–ocean interactions generate warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the North Atlantic that persist from March to August. These mid–latitude SST anomalies in the North Atlantic trigger an atmospheric wave train that propagates from the North Atlantic to the North Pacific, ultimately inducing pronounced westerly wind anomalies in the upper troposphere and easterly wind anomalies in the lower troposphere over the tropical western Pacific in July–August. This circulation pattern enhances vertical wind shear, promoting anomalous ascent via dynamic pumping and increasing rainfall. Simulations using the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM5.3) further validate the proposed mechanism."

However, due to the absence of a systematic evaluation benchmark, it remains unclear whether LLMs can be trusted to support core air pollution control tasks such as pollution alarming and mitigation recommendation, which limits their real-world deployment. This study developed a benchmark dataset aligned with the One Atmosphere framework (OneAtmos-Bench), by using a two-stage automated extraction pipeline. Leveraging this dataset, 11 LLMs were evaluated across three key metrics: accuracy, instruction-following (IF), and hallucination rate (HR). Expert validation confirms that the OneAtmos-Bench dataset achieves 95.88% accuracy. The evaluation results indicate that while IF remains consistently strong, both accuracy and hallucination suppression are still constrained, especially for long-tail tasks in the atmospheric domain. Notably, the marginal improvements from scaling up the model size for atmospheric tasks highlight sparse domain adaptation, and common training strategies to enhance reasoning ability, particularly distillation-based supervised fine-tuning, may inadvertently increase the HR. These findings reveal that general-purpose LLMs present reliability challenges in delivering the trustworthy, low-hallucination guidance required for efficient air pollution control decision-making, highlighting the need for environment-specific adaptation."

Biomimetic chromatography utilizes immobilized artificial membrane (IAM), human serum albumin (HSA), and alpha-1-glycoprotein (AGP) stationary phases to determine partition coefficients. A rapid-gradient biomimetic approach was used to determine partition coefficients for 81 target PFAS and 37 suspect PFAS in a 3M aqueous film forming foam. PFAS were categorized as acids, bases, or neutrals and used to interpret lipophilic contributions to binding on IAM, HSA, and AGP columns. Partition coefficients on the IAM membrane (log KIAM: 1.4 to 7.9; median 3.4) and AGP protein (log kAGP: −1.9 to 0.72; median 0.31) increased linearly with increasing fluorinated chain length, while those for HSA protein (log KHSA: 0.45 to 5.1; median 4.3) reached a plateau at a specific chain length (∼C6–C8). Zwitterionic PFAS at pH 7.4 exhibited lower affinities for both the IAM membrane and HSA protein, which are likely due to the smaller fraction of the charged species at pH 7.4. The partition coefficients (CHI log D [chromatographic log D derived from the Chromatographic Hydrophobicity Index scaled to the octanol/water partition coefficient, log D]), log KIAM, log KHSA, and log kAGP) expand our understanding of how PFAS behave in the body and provide a foundation for future toxicokinetic modeling.The rapid-gradient approach offers a novel method for measuring partition coefficients for PFAS in complex mixtures."

Proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-TOF-MS) was used to monitor COFs, focusing on six typical pollutants: benzene, toluene, butadiene, acrolein, acetaldehyde, and formic acid, measured at six spatially distributed points. Near the stove, thermally driven convection led to vertical stratification: volatile aromatics accumulated in the upper zone, while heavier alcohols and carbonyls settled lower. Partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) confirmed distinct COF compositions at ceiling level, while lower zones across the kitchen and living area shared similarities due to horizontal advection. All six compounds showed substantial concentration losses during migration, indicating nonuniform exposure risk from kitchen to living room. Formic acid exhibited slow secondary formation, leading to its delayed presence in the living area. Cross-correlation analysis identified toluene and butadiene as likely precursors of formic acid via gas-phase oxidation through secondary transformation (peak lag = −1; r = 0.593 and 0.578).

These peroxide species decompose to form radicals upon aqueous dissolution. While the mechanism responsible for producing these radicals has yet to be fully elucidated, one prevailing hypothesis to support this phenomenon is Fenton-like reactions between redox-active metals and peroxides. Vaping emits various redox-active metals, which may play an important role in mediating these types of aqueous reactions. Here, we observed that the production of radicals resulting from the aqueous decomposition of aged e-cigarette aerosols was found to be highly dependent on the presence of redox-active metals, indicating the reliance of Fenton-like reactions on mediating the formation of radicals. Additionally, we observed that peroxides and metals are enriched within the ultrafine particles (UFPs) of aged vaping emissions, which leads to a drastic enhancement of their ability to generate radicals. This work provides a mechanistic perspective regarding the oxidative ability of aged e-cigarette aerosols, as well as potential negative implications associated with their inhalation and subsequent deposition in aqueous regions of the lungs."

This study analyzed 22 MSW subcomponents sorted from 1000 kg of waste for 67 PFAS compounds using standardized leaching tests (L/S = 10). The highest levels were found in polycoated aseptic containers (36 ng/g), rubber, leather, and textiles (25 ng/g), and yard waste (11 ng/g). Other paper, plastic, electronics, and construction and demolition waste had moderate PFAS levels (0.6–8.9 ng/g), while glass had the lowest (0.13 ng/g). PFAS profiles varied across materials, with some dominated by terminal perfluoroalkyl acids and others dominated by precursors such as FTCAs. The weighted average PFAS concentration across the waste stream was 4.1 ng/g. To assess broader implications, measured concentrations were extrapolated to national MSW composition data. Based on an assumed 10% leachability factor from prior studies, the total PFAS mass in MSW may be closer to 16,000 kg/year, with about 1600 kg per year potentially leachable. Of the leachable portion, approximately 780 kg enters landfills, where much of it is likely mobilized into leachate. The remaining leachable mass was distributed across recycling (330 kg), composting (220 kg), and combustion (230 kg). Although rubber, leather, and textiles comprise only 9% of the national MSW by weight, they account for an estimated 38% of leachable PFAS mass.

Seinfeld,Complex Effects of Reduced Mobile Source Emissions on Submicron Particulate Matter Concentrations in Los Angeles,"Despite considerable reductions in mobile source emissions, annual average aerosol concentrations measured in Los Angeles using Federal Reference Methods (FRM) have not appreciably declined over the past decade. Here, we use submicron aerosol measurements and zero-dimensional modeling to quantify the impacts of these emission reductions on aerosol formation in Pasadena, CA, during the late spring and summer of 2022. Reductions in secondary organic aerosol (SOA) concentrations expected from reduced mobile source emissions appear to have been largely offset by increases in hydroxyl radical concentrations, an indirect effect of reduced nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. As a result, while the predicted contribution of mobile sources to the SOA burden has declined from ∼50% in 2010 to only ∼25% in 2022, concentrations of locally formed SOA have remained relatively constant. In contrast, reductions in mobile source NOx emissions have likely reduced overnight production of nitric acid and ammonium nitrate (AN) aerosol. We provide indirect evidence that FRM measurements may have failed to capture the reduction in AN since 2010 due to the evaporation of semivolatile species from FRM filter samples. Our results suggest that given the effectiveness of historical regulatory efforts aimed at mobile sources, and on-road sources in particular, additional reductions in submicron aerosol concentrations in Los Angeles will likely require increased focus on abating emissions from nonroad and area sources."

While the accumulation and toxicity of MPs in organisms at low trophic levels have been documented, the analysis of the absolute cellular uptake of MPs at a single-cell level with high-throughput methods remains a challenge. In this study, we developed a flow cytometry-based approach integrating a particle balance method and biokinetic modeling to quantitatively assess the uptake and elimination dynamics of fluorescently labeled MPs in the freshwater ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila. The intracellular accumulation of MPs was calculated by subtracting the extracellular MPs from the total exposure amount, ensuring that the measurement was free from interference caused by fluorescence quenching or cellular background noise. Our results revealed that intracellular MPs continuously increased during the first hour, followed by a marked decline within 24 h. By applying a biokinetic model, we demonstrated that the effect of cell division on reducing MP burden is 3.6 to 5.8 times greater than that of elimination, depending on the exposure concentration. The calculated bioconcentration factors (BCFs) exceed 4800, indicating a significant potential for bioaccumulation of MPs in T. thermophila. These results enhance our understanding of the initial processes through which MPs enter the food chain and provide essential technical support for further research on the quantitative toxicity assessment of MP pollution."

However, if retrieval errors in the satellite‐derived AOD are not corrected or characterized, they can lead to false analysis increments and ultimately degrade the quality of data assimilation (DA). The issue also arises in the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI)‐II AOD product, which remains susceptible to cloud contamination. To address the issue, this study developed a cloud screening framework for GOCI‐II AOD that combines two processes: (a) cloud removal using cloud type information from Himawari‐8/9 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) and (b) a statistical cloud filtering based on AOD retrieval characteristics. Comparisons with Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOD demonstrated that the cloud screening framework effectively mitigated overestimation of GOCI‐II AODs compared to AERONET AODs. Consequently, the cloud‐screened GOCI‐II AOD showed a better agreement with AERONET AOD, improving Pearson's correlation coefficient from 0.77 to 0.82 and decreasing root‐mean‐square error from 0.175 to 0.110. Despite these improvements, the normalized biases of the cloud‐screened GOCI‐II AOD against AERONET AOD still exhibited diurnal variations, with GOCI‐II AODs being overestimated in coastal regions and underestimated in inland sites, under low‐AOD conditions. Nonetheless, the enhanced consistency of the cloud‐screened GOCI‐II AOD with AERONET AOD and its more Gaussian‐like error distribution supports the utility of the cloud screening framework in improving the quality of GOCI‐II AOD for DA systems."

This study evaluated the Sigmoid Generalized Complementary (SGC) equation for estimating evaporation in a subtropical mangrove forest in the southern China, focusing on the effects of tidal inundation time fraction (TI) and salinity (SAL) on both evaporation and model parameters. Using a decade of eddy covariance and meteorological data, we found that the SGC equation accurately captured the diurnal and seasonal evaporation dynamics achieving high performance (R2 = 0.94, RMSE = 11.98 W m−2; daily) with the best‐fit parameters (α = 1.13, b = ∞). α is the atmospheric character parameter representing the atmospheric advection effect and b is the land surface parameter representing the surface moisture condition. Although TI had limited impact on the evaporation magnitude, it sufficiently affected parameter b which transitioned from land‐like to open‐water characteristics as inundation increased. Salinity did not significantly affect the SGC parameters but was negatively correlated with monthly evaporation, especially when exceeding about 15 PSU. Diurnally, evaporation was primarily controlled by net radiation rather than water level or salinity, and no water‐energy decoupling was observed at the seasonal scale. These findings demonstrate the robustness and applicability of the SGC framework in intertidal environments, offer a new perspective for modeling evaporation in intertidal zones, and provide new insights into the interactions between hydrological drivers, salinity stress, and evaporation in mangroves."

 The digital transformation of supply chains presents a promising option to reduce urban pollutants and carbon dioxide emissions. Here, we utilize China’s Supply Chain Innovation and Application Pilot Policy as a quasi-natural experiment. We assess its impact on urban pollutants and carbon dioxide emissions. We compile a city-year panel dataset by merging high-resolution emissions inventories with socioeconomic data across 279 prefecture-level cities from 2005 to 2021. We found that supply chain digitalization reduces urban pollutants and carbon dioxide emissions by 7.1%-9.9% locally; however, these emissions increase by 4.4% in neighboring jurisdictions. Medium-small-sized and non-industrial cities benefit the most from supply chain digitalization, while megacities and entrenched industrial hubs see modest benefits. Our findings show that while digital supply chain innovations can advance urban sustainability, integrated regional instruments, such as linked city-level emissions trading schemes and shared digital monitoring, reporting, and verification infrastructure, are needed to reduce emissions spillover. Supply chain digitalization reduces urban air pollutants and carbon dioxide emissions by up to 9 percent locally but increases them by 4 percent in nearby areas, according to an analysis that uses a quasi-natural experiment and a difference-in-differences method"

 Submarine explosive volcanism shapes seafloor morphology, impacts marine ecosystems, and poses risks to maritime infrastructure and coastal communities. However, its occurrences and drivers remain poorly constrained, especially for basaltic systems. Here we present evidence for widespread phreatomagmatic volcanism at the Reykjanes Ridge north of ~63.2°N, derived from high-resolution seismic reflection profiles, multibeam bathymetry, and seafloor imagery. Our data indicate a first-order depth control on eruption style: effusive volcanism dominates below ~300 m, producing hummocky edifices with strong seismic attenuation, whereas shallower depths favour Surtseyan eruptions, forming smooth volcanic cones with flanks comprising stratified, outward-dipping seismic reflections. When eruptions occur close to the water–air interface, flat-topped volcanoes form, some emerging as ephemeral islands before being submerged by storm wave base erosion. Our results show that Surtseyan eruptions have been a dominant and recurrent process along the Reykjanes Ridge north of ~63.2°N since the Last Glacial Maximum.

 Advancements in close-range remote sensing offer promises in automated forest inventory, facilitating sustainable forest management. Backpack LiDAR is a mobile mapping system that can be deployed for different applications, including forest inventory. However, under-canopy trajectories derived from backpacks equipped with GNSS units are often unreliable due to signal outages, resulting in degraded mapping results. To overcome this challenge, an Integrated Scan Simultaneous Trajectory Enhancement and Mapping (IS2-TEAM) framework is proposed for fine-resolution forest inventory. For multi-beam spinning LiDAR, a single scan refers to points from a full revolution of the laser beam assembly, while an integrated scan combines multiple successive single scans. The framework introduces feature extraction strategies for defining reliable semantic features (tree trunk and ground) from integrated scans to enhance trajectory and mapping results. If available, the framework can incorporate a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) extracted from existing geospatial data to enhance georeferencing accuracy of backpack LiDAR. Finally, extracted features together with enhanced point cloud undergo a machine-learning post-processing strategy to evaluate the IS2-TEAM's performance in tree detection and provide tree classification results based on maturity. The proposed approach has been thoroughly evaluated across multiple study sites with different forest types and terrain conditions. Through the experimental results, it has been shown that the IS2-TEAM extracts reliable ground and tree trunk features and generates point clouds with alignment quality range of 2–4 cm. Furthermore, DTM-assisted IS2-TEAM significantly improves the georeferencing accuracy of the derived point cloud in forests with varying terrain conditions, achieving an average vertical accuracy improvement of 1 m across all test datasets. Finally, the proposed self-evaluation strategy successfully identifies all mature trees and achieves over 90 % accuracy in tree classification."

 Comprehensive evaluation of satellite and model-based soil moisture (SM) products is essential for their further development and application. With the advent of Cosmic Ray Neutron Sensing (CRNS), which has an observation radius of 130–240 m, the spatial representativeness mismatch between these grid-based SM products and ground single-point observations during the evaluation process can be feasibly relieved. In this study, we systematically evaluated 23 gridded SM products, including single-sensor satellite, multi-sensor merged, and model-based products, using 68 CRNS measurement sites across the Europe. Our evaluation revealed that the SMAP-INRAE-BORDEAUX (SMAP-IB) SM retrievals showed the superior consistency with CRNS measurements among all analyzed products, demonstrating both high correlation (R = 0.80) and low unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE = 0.050 m3/m3). The CCI/C3S combined active-passive SM products ranked second in performance (R > 0.75, ubRMSE <0.060 m3/m3). In the bias analysis, 17 products had negative bias (−0.003 m3/m3 to −0.190 m3/m3) against CRNS measurements, while AMSR2-LPRM at C1 and C2 bands and CCI/C3S at active and passive products had positive bias (0.011 m3/m3 to 0.161 m3/m3). It was also found that the capabilities of all SM products retrievals degraded in terms of R and ubRMSE with increasing vegetation density, topographic complexity and soil wetness. Most products showed the lowest ubRMSE and highest R values in cropland compared to other land cover types. Our study emphasizes the substantial potential of cosmic field-scale SM observations for the validation of satellite- and model-based SM products, and our findings have the potential to advance algorithm refinement, product improvement, and hydrometeorological applications."

 Formaldehyde (HCHO) critically mediates atmospheric photochemistry, yet its source-specific impacts remain poorly quantified. Integrating Positive Matrix Factorization and Observation-Based Models, we reveal average HCHO concentrations of 5.6 ± 1.6 ppb during ozone (O3) episodes in Zhengzhou, China, with 43 % originating from RO· + O2-driven secondary formation. Anthropogenic emission contributes 49 % (e.g., vehicles: 19 %, industry: 16 %). Under Zero-HCHO simulations, concentrations of HO2·, OH·, and RO2· decreased by 27 %, 20 %, and 12 %, respectively, with a concomitant 19 % reduction in net O3 production. Source-specific HCHO reveals that secondary production dominated both ROx· (44–48 % contribution) and net O3 (52 % contribution) formation. Notably, biogenic HCHO emissions serve a critical function in daytime photochemical oxidant formation (14–18 %) despite its 7 % HCHO share. Diurnal analysis further identifies morning rush-hour emissions of HCHO from vehicles/industries that act as photochemical primers, boosting 22 % and 15 % O3 formation, respectively. This study provides the mechanistic, source-resolved quantification of HCHO's role in radical cycling and O3 formation, establishing a critical link between emission sources and photochemical outcomes for targeted pollution control."

 Atmospheric aerosols significantly influence air quality, climate and human health, making detailed source attribution and transport characterization essential. This study integrates multiple advanced techniques-air mass cluster analysis, Concentration Weighted Trajectory (CWT) analysis and Conditional Bivariate Probability Function (CBPF) analysis; to investigate aerosol emission sources and transport pathways at three Central European measurement stations: Melpitz (MEL, Germany), Frýdlant (FRY, Czech Republic) and Košetice (NAOK, Czech Republic). Online measurements of non-refractory submicron aerosols (NR-PM1) using aerosol mass spectrometer, combined with equivalent black carbon (eBC) and brown carbon (BrC) data from aethalometers, enabled detailed characterization of aerosol composition and sources during winter (February–March 2021) and summer (July–August 2021) campaigns. In winter, the highest PM1 mass concentrations were recorded at NAOK (13.2 μg/m3), followed by FRY (6.4 μg/m3) and MEL (6.3 μg/m3), with organic aerosol (OA) and nitrate as major components. Diurnal trends revealed strong nighttime enhancements, especially at NAOK, indicating residential heating influence. Cluster analysis identified eastern continental air masses as dominant contributors to elevated PM levels at all sites. CWT analysis showed significant source regions for eBC, BrC and secondary inorganic aerosols in Poland and the Czech Republic, particularly for MEL and FRY. In contrast, CBPF analysis indicated local sources as the primary contributors to high OA, eBC, and BrC levels at NAOK, especially under low wind conditions (<2 m/s), suggesting biomass burning and residential heating as key sources. During summer, PM1 concentrations were more uniform across sites, with slightly higher values at MEL (8.6 μg/m3) compared to NAOK (7.3 μg/m3) and FRY (6.5 μg/m3). Enhanced biogenic emissions and photochemical activity led to increased organic fractions, with NAOK exhibiting the highest proportion (75 % of PM1 mass). This study demonstrates the advantages of integrating multiple analytical techniques to distinguish between local and long-range sources, assess seasonal variability, and characterize long-range transport patterns, providing key insights for air quality management in Central Europe."

 BackgroundWhile long-term exposure to air pollutants may increase the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the relative contributions of different air pollutants and the role of particulate matter (PMx) size remain elusive. We investigated independent and joint effects of long-term exposure to PM of different sizes (PM1, PM2.5, PM10, PM1-2.5, and PM2.5-10) and gaseous pollutants (NO2, SO2, and CO) on NAFLD incidence, as well as the impact of different PM2.5 components.MethodsThis prospective study included 31,105 participants from the Chinese Cohort of Working Adults (CCWA). Newly diagnosed cases of NAFLD were identified through ultrasound-based diagnosis of hepatic steatosis during physical examination. Logistic regression was employed to estimate associations of individual air pollutants and PM2.5 components with NAFLD. Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression assessed the joint effect of air pollutants and their relative contribution to the joint effect. Stratified analyses by demographic, behavioral, and health factors were also conducted.ResultsEach interquartile increase in the exposure to individual air pollutants and PM2.5 components was associated with a higher incidence of NAFLD. PM1-2.5 showed the strongest positive association (OR: 1.21, 95 % CI: 1.15–1.28). Among PM2.5 components, organic matter (OM) had the highest independent effect (OR: 1.19, 95 % CI: 1.12–1.26). Among all included pollutants, PM1-2.5 contributed most (71 %) to the joint effect on the NAFLD incidence at follow-up, followed by PM1 (16 %) and NO2 (13 %); of the PM2.5 components, OM contributed the most (56 %). Effects of air pollutants on the NAFLD incidence were more pronounced in men and smokers.ConclusionLong-term exposure to PM1-2.5 within the PM2.5 size range most importantly affects new-onset NAFLD, and within PM2.5 components OM appears to be the most relevant contributor. This study may provide valuable insights into implementing preventive strategies for NAFLD."

 This study provides a comprehensive climatology of summer subtropical anticyclones (SAs) over Southwest Asia using daily ERA-Interim geopotential height data (1990–2019) across six pressure levels (900–100 hPa). Anticyclones were identified on 2760 summer days using combined objective and subjective methods, enabling a multi-level assessment of their frequency, spatial organization, preferred locations, vertical structure, seasonal evolution, and long-term variability. SAs are found throughout the atmospheric column, with maximum frequencies in the mid-troposphere and minimum occurrences near the surface. Distinct spatial modes emerge at different levels—bimodal at 500 hPa, trimodal at 700 hPa, and quadrimodal at 100–200 hPa—revealing finer spatial complexity than earlier climatologies. A key finding is a pronounced vertical seesaw pattern in seasonal occurrence: lower-tropospheric anticyclones peak in June but decline sharply in July, while mid- and upper-tropospheric anticyclones intensify. This indicates a coordinated vertical redistribution of anticyclonic activity during summer. Interlevel relationships exhibit strong coherence in the upper troposphere, whereas weaker correlations between adjacent lower and mid-tropospheric levels suggest level-dependent formation mechanisms and vertical tilt. Regionally, the study refines the characteristics of the Turkmenistan, Zagros, and Arabian anticyclones, highlighting the vertical continuity of the Arabian anticyclone and its sensitivity to surface thermal forcing. Long-term analysis reveals no significant meridional shifts but shows a notable increase in anticyclone frequency at 700 hPa, likely linked to recent warming over the Arabian Peninsula. Overall, the findings demonstrate the dynamical complexity of SAs across Southwest Asia and provide an updated framework for understanding their variability and climate relevance."

 A unique set of observations allows the analysis of the environment in which a back-building mesoscale convective system (MCS) developed along a dryline in the semi-arid southern Kalahari region of southern Africa during 28 and 29 December 2023. This MCS resulted in widespread rainfall, roughly equivalent to the December–February average, causing localized flooding and power failures. MCS development occurred along a dryline in a highly unstable, but weakly sheared environment. Near surface moisture gradients exceeded 6 g kg−1 100 km−1 in places on the dryline during morning and evening of 28 December but were weaker that afternoon. CAPE values exceeded 1000 J.kg−1 shortly after sunrise within the first 100 km of the moist side of the dryline and MU-CAPE exceeded 3000 J kg−1 at 08:00 and 12:00 UTC. Convection started adjacent to the dryline and once individual storm cells merged to form a MCS, new cells continued to develop along the dryline before being steered downstream by mid-level northwesterly winds. Back-building and a strong northeasterly low-level inflow contributed to renewed development along the storm's axis during the night-time, extending its lifespan to at least 13 h. These findings provide new insights into the contribution of MCSs to seasonal rainfall for the southern Kalahari region and a valuable example of mesoscale interactions between a dryline and individual storm cells at night."

However, their sources and transboundary dynamics in ecologically fragile regions such as the Himalayas remain poorly resolved. Here, we combined antimony stable isotopes (ε123Sb), air-mass trajectory analysis, and multivariate mixing modeling to elucidate the sources and seasonal transport mechanisms of SbPM2.5 at Mount Qomolangma Station (QOMS) on the Tibetan Plateau, based on year-round samples collected during the premonsoon, monsoon, postmonsoon, and winter seasons. The annual mean Sb concentration (0.88 ± 0.64 ng m–3) was comparable to values reported for European urban sites, indicating a substantial transboundary influence. Sb isotopic signatures (ε123Sb: −1.92 to +1.61 ε) exhibited clear seasonality: lighter values prevailed in winter and premonsoon samples and were associated with South Asian coal combustion (28 ± 10%) and biomass burning (29 ± 10%), whereas heavier values in the postmonsoon period reflected an increased contribution from desert dust (41 ± 11%). Monsoon-driven precipitation modulated the observed isotopic composition with wet scavenging preferentially removing lighter isotopes. A multivariate mixing model that integrates Sb isotopes and Rb/Sr ratios resolved three primary sources, desert dust (23–64%), coal combustion (13–46%), and biomass burning (14–45%), whose influences are linked to westerly circulation and glacial-valley winds. This study represents the first application of Sb isotopes to trace atmospheric Sb at a high-altitude site and demonstrates monsoon-regulated transport and a dominant anthropogenic signal from South Asia. These findings provide critical insights into trans-boundary heavy-metal pollution in high-altitude ecosystems and inform strategies for mitigating environmental risks in the Himalayas and comparable regions worldwide."

However, the long-term trend and sources of Cl2 remain poorly understood, especially regarding the key factors driving nocturnal Cl2 formation under moderately acidic conditions of aerosol. In this study, over a year of continuous Cl2 measurements in urban Beijing revealed a continuous nocturnal increase (from 19:00 to 05:00) in Cl2 concentration (up to 242 ppt), accompanied by increases in ClNO2 concentration and aerosol pH. The mean heterogeneous uptake coefficient of ClNO2 (γClNO2) decreased from 2.2 × 10–4 to 3.6 × 10–5 when the mean aerosol pH varied from 2.6 to 5.2, while Cl2 concentrations were underestimated if only the variation of aerosol pH was accounted for. Multivariate nonlinear regression revealed that although high aerosol pH hindered the Cl2 formation via heterogeneous uptake of ClNO2, this process is possibly promoted by elevated aerosol ionic strength at high aerosol pH values, jointly driving nocturnal Cl2 variability. This finding suggests that aerosol chemical properties, especially ionic strength, may play an important role in promoting reactive chlorine chemistry in polluted urban atmospheres."

The best-performing stacking ensemble, led by XGBoost as a meta-learner, achieved a test set R2 of 0.966 and a RMSE of 10.17 MJ/mol, demonstrating excellent accuracy and generalization. SHAP and partial dependence plot analyses identified key variables─such as power, nitrogen percentage, discharge frequency, and water vapor content─and revealed their nonlinear contributions to energy efficiency. Furthermore, bivariate PDPs uncovered synergistic interactions (e.g., between power and gas composition) that guide multiparameter optimization strategies. Experimental validation confirmed the model’s robustness, with prediction errors of less than 7% for boundary cases. This framework not only advances predictive modeling in plasma engineering but also provides actionable insights into the parametric tuning of nitrogen fixation systems. The approach can be scaled to other plasma-assisted or hybrid electrochemical nitrogen conversion routes."

Middle Miocene proxy records show reversed Arabian Sea zonal gradients (warmer west than east) and reduced Indian Ocean meridional gradients compared to today—patterns coupled models cannot reproduce, hindering accurate SASM simulation. To assess these impacts, we conducted three prescribed‐SST experiments with mid‐Miocene boundary conditions: a control using coupled‐model SSTs and two cases imposing reversed zonal and reduced meridional gradients based on proxy‐derived SSTs. Reversed zonal gradients decreased SASM rainfall; reduced meridional gradients showed minimal impact. Since most mid‐Miocene simulations with modern‐like zonal SST gradients overestimate Indian precipitation, capturing zonal gradients is critical for reducing model–data discrepancies. These zonal gradient shifts from reversed mid‐Miocene toward modern‐like late mid‐Miocene conditions, likely driven by high‐latitude cooling, represent key precursors to the modern SASM. Model biases in simulating warm‐climate polar amplification likely underlie their inability to reproduce Miocene monsoon transitions."

However, current generation climate models often fail to capture TC inner‐core dynamical structures, leading to substantial underestimation (>50%) of TC rainfall (TCR). Here, using a set of eddy‐resolving high‐resolution (HR) simulations from the Community Earth System Model (CESM), we show that simulated TCR closely aligns with observations, primarily due to the improved TC upward motion. Under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 warming scenario, projected TCR increases in non‐eddy‐resolving models reach only 15%–50% of those in HR CESM, likely reflecting their large historical TCR biases. Owing to suppressed TC upward motion, the projected TCR fractional increase by non‐eddy‐resolving models remain comparable to or below the Clausius‐Clapeyron (C‐C) scaling. In contrast, HR CESM projects a much larger TCR increase rate (∼12.0% K−1), exceeding the C‐C rate and driven by a strengthened TC upward motion."

The most prominent response is significant increased sea ice coverage in the northern Amundsen Sea and decreased sea ice coverage in the northern Weddell Sea. The northern Amundsen Sea experiences sea surface and near‐surface atmospheric cooling and a strengthened Amundsen Sea Low, while the northern Weddell Sea exhibits warming and above‐normal sea‐level pressure. In the Amundsen Sea, both oceanic thermodynamic and atmospheric dynamical effects contribute to sea ice growth during the freeze‐up season, with atmospheric dynamics playing a dominant role during the melting season. In contrast, sea ice decline in the Weddell Sea is primarily driven by oceanic warming during the freeze‐up season and atmospheric circulation anomalies during the melting season."

The microphysical mechanisms that govern this process, known as glaciation, are expected to act on minute timescales. Nevertheless, stratiform clouds can persist in the mixed‐phase temperature range (from 0° ${}^{\circ}$C to −38° ${}^{\circ}$C) for hours, thus glaciation events remain poorly characterized. Here, we analyze satellite observations of individual cloud tops to track their temporal phase evolution and to quantify the extent of glaciation. We find that most glaciation events do not result in complete freezing; rather, they induce a sustained shift in cloud properties while the clouds remain in the mixed‐phase regime. Our results indicate that higher hemispheric and seasonal concentrations of ice‐nucleating particles correlate with glaciation occurrence rate. Future studies can utilize our phase‐evolution and glaciation data sets to evaluate how well weather and climate models simulate mixed‐phased cloud evolution and phase heterogeneity."

This study investigated the 2013 extreme hot event (EHE) in central and eastern China using Weather Research and Forecasting model with resolution of 25 and 9 km (WRF25 and WRF9) respectively. Results indicated that the simulations of WRF9 outperformed WRF25 and added‐value was primarily attributed to the influence of diabatic heating, which was modulated by land‐atmosphere feedback. The more arid soil moisture limited evapotranspiration and enhanced sensible heat flux, triggering a stronger positive soil moisture‐atmosphere interaction simulated by WRF9 compared to WRF25. The higher net surface energy budget and lower cloud cover in WRF9 can heat the surface temperature even more and amplify the surface‐atmosphere temperature gradient. Notably, the strength of land‐atmosphere coupling in WRF9 was more pronounced than in WRF25. These findings have implications for the importance of model resolution in capturing the complex processes in EHE."

However, the δ15N signatures from some important anthropogenic NOx sources, for example, the coke and cement industries, are unknown, and reports on the signatures of δ15N(NOx) from coal‐fired power plants and other fossil fuel combustion related industrial processes are limited. Here, we report a comprehensive investigation of δ15N(NOx) from various emission sources in Taiyuan, a megacity in Northern China where coal dominated the energy consumption before 2018. The different sources were investigated in 2023–2024, and the δ15N(NOx) signatures for coal‐fired and gas‐fired power plants are (20.0 ± 2.3) ‰ and (−19.8 ± 0.8) ‰ (mean ± 1σ), respectively. While for residential gas furnaces, municipal solid waste incineration plants, coke industry, and cement industry, the δ15N(NOx) signatures were measured as (−18.5 ± 0.8) ‰, (11.7 ± 2.4) ‰, (−10.9 ± 1.9) ‰, and (8.1 ± 2.3) ‰, respectively. Among them, the coke and cement industries have not been quantified before. In addition to these emission sources, we further collected ambient NOx and found in Taiyuan the ambient δ15N(NOx) values were significantly lower in winter ((−14.1 ± 4.2) ‰) than those in summer ((−4.2 ± 1.7) ‰). This is because in winter Taiyuan natural gas is the predominant NOx emission source. That the winter δ15N(NOx) was lower than that in summer appears to be opposite to previously reported seasonality of δ15N(NO3−) values in Northern China which was suggested to be caused by seasonal δ15N(NOx) differences, and this is likely because after the implementation of the coal‐to‐gas project and clean air policy in 2018, natural gas combustion became the dominant NOx emission source in winter which is the heating season with extensive demand of fuel consumption."

They are believed to be generated by aircraft passing through supercooled cloud layers; however, the exact formation mechanisms remain poorly understood due to the scarcity of observations. In addition, basic HPC formation characteristics, such as expansion speed, are controversial. Using geostationary meteorological satellite Himawari‐8 data and aircraft flight data of Flightradar24, this study clarifies HPC formation and development from 59 HPCs. Two growth stages of HPCs are identified: first, linear HPCs are formed. The length (Lmajor) and width (Lminor) of one of the long HPCs grew at rates of 43 m s−1 and 3.8 m s−1. This occurs within 10–20 min of an aircraft passing through supercooled clouds and their orientations consistent with tracks of aircraft. The upward expansion speed of the HPC was approximately 1.2 m s−1. Second, these linear HPCs expand slowly and homogeneously for over an hour. The growth rate modes of Lmajor and Lminor of all HPCs were both 1–2 m s−1. All observed HPCs initially appeared as lines, thus supporting that HPCs are generated by aircraft. Sub‐grid‐scale cloud‐free areas or extremely thin supercooled cloud layers where aircraft passed would not generate HPCs. This is because not all aircraft that passed supercooled clouds generated HPCs."

Simulated mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are separated into slow and rapid growth by the rate of spatial growth from convection initiation until reaching the MCS scale. A low‐level jet (LLJ) is found more frequently near the deep convection that experiences rapid growth to an MCS, but its presence alone is not predictive of rapid growth. Using spatially‐averaged parameters, we find that rapid growth to MCSs also occurs in environments that are significantly more thermodynamically favorable with greater low‐level moisture and instability. Fewer significant differences are found in the kinematic environment with only the 0–2 km vertical wind shear magnitude being significantly larger for rapid growth MCSs compared to slow growth MCSs, potentially related to LLJs often peaking near this height. When focusing only on MCSs with the slowest and fastest growth rates, elevated‐layer shear is significantly smaller for very rapid growth MCSs, suggesting elevated‐layer shear may help discriminate between the upper and lower bounds of growth rate. Finally, when upscale growth occurs near the Sierras de Córdoba (SDC) with a LLJ present, rapid growth is also supported by favorable wind shear orientation. However, this does not hold for upscale growth occurring away from the SDC, highlighting the importance of interpreting shear direction relative to the orientation of features initiating deep convection."

However, existing studies have neither unraveled the influence of orbital dynamics on such radiation nor quantified how clouds modify these periodic signatures at the planetary scale, which leaves the underlying mechanisms driving disk‐integrated radiation variations obscure and makes it difficult to isolate the authentic signals of the planetary system. In this study, outputs from NASA's Goddard Earth Observing System Version 5 (GEOS‐5) model were mapped onto the Moon‐based Earth observation geometry to simulate time‐series data of disk‐integrated radiation. The variability characteristics of this radiation were quantified via spherical harmonic decomposition, and the constructed spherical harmonic fingerprints effectively separate orbital dynamics and radiation signatures in disk‐integrated observations. Results show that (a) Moon‐based disk‐integrated radiation variations are dominated by 1st‐ and 2nd‐degree spherical harmonics, capturing large‐scale radiative features while smoothing fine‐scale fluctuations; (b) key cycles driven by Earth‐Moon geometry include the synodic month, the sidereal month, and their semiperiodic counterparts, which are primarily governed by sectoral and zonal harmonic components, respectively; (c) clouds systematically reduce disk‐integrated radiation but preserve orbital‐driven periodicities, which averages out local cloud effects while retaining celestial motion signals. This study further discussed the potential of these observations to refine general circulation models (GCMs) via planetary‐scale reality checks, as well as of bridging Earth system science and astrophysics by using Earth as a sample. In general, this study lays a foundation for interpreting disk‐integrated radiation features in future missions."

 The air-sea interface is a major climate control for our planet. At high winds this boundary layer becomes turbulent and challenging to parameterize. Sea spray is only now emerging as an important but unaccounted for parameter in air-sea models. Here we apply state-of-the-art air-sea surface sea spray generation models coupled to a carbonate system model to predict the spray-driven flux of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas between the atmosphere and ocean at various wind speeds and sea states. When these droplets are injected into air, they experience gas exchange affected by both temperature equilibration and evaporation. The latter process leads to a super-saline and acidic droplet that removes dissolved inorganic carbonate and bicarbonate, chemically converting them to additional CO2 and thereby evading more CO2 than is predicted by traditional models that do not consider this process. At 40% evaporation, the droplet evicts all its dissolved inorganic carbon, which is a 100-fold increase in potential CO2 evasion. Evaporating sea spray acts as a significant feedback to ocean CO2 uptake and could serve important roles in episodic storm events and over longer planetary timescales."

 The bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) is a fundamental variable in urban surface energy balance and is crucial for applications requiring surface anisotropy information, such as aerosol monitoring, land cover classification, and so on. However, challenges remain in obtaining accurate BRDF information over urban areas using remotely sensed data. While some existing kernel-driven models provide timely and efficient BRDF retrieval and have been widely used in deriving global products, they were primarily designed for vegetation-covered surfaces with reduced accuracy over urban surfaces. To address these limitations, this study developed the Urban Analytical Kernel-driven Model (UAKM), which incorporates urban structures to better capture illumination and shadow patterns. Comparative experiments were conducted using simulated data from the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model and Landsat surface reflectance to evaluate UAKM's performance compared with RossThick-LiSparse Reciprocal (RTLSR) and RossThick–Roujean (RTROU) models. In DART-based experiments with dense angular sampling, UAKM achieved the lowest RMSEs (<0.008) and uniquely captured two key urban-specific BRDF characteristics: (1) a reduced growth rate in BRDF at the hotspot along the principal plane rather than a peak; and (2) a BRDF minimum displaced approximately 45° in azimuth from the forward-scattering principal plane. In satellite-based retrievals, UAKM also yielded the lowest RMSEs—below 0.016 in visible bands and below 0.026 in the near-infrared band—while exhibiting stronger robustness to uncertainties in solar viewing geometry. Overall, UAKM contributes to advancing BRDF modeling by integrating urban structural features, providing an efficient, accurate, and robust tool for urban monitoring with satellite data."

Relative to SPEAR, HybridCPLsystematically reduces seasonal forecast errors in the Arctic and considerably reduces Antarctic errors for target months May to December, with >2× error reduction in 4- to 6-month lead forecasts of Antarctic winter sea ice extent. Meanwhile, HybridIOsuffers from out-of-sample behavior that can trigger a chain of Southern Ocean feedbacks, leading to ice-free Antarctic summers.

We demonstrate that the autoencoder can largely capture nonlinear physical relationships, enabling LDA to produce balanced analyses without explicitly modeling physical constraints. Assimilation in latent space also improves both analysis quality and forecast skill compared to traditional model-space DA, under both idealized and real observational settings. Furthermore, LDA exhibits strong robustness across latent dimensions and remains effective even when the autoencoder is trained on inaccurate but physically realistic forecasts, highlighting its flexibility for real-world applications."

In this study, we simulate idealized large-scale AD in an Earth system model of intermediate complexity with different acid injection depths and downwelling intensities and find a maximum marine CDR (mCDR) potential for continuous AD (0.25 Pmol yr−1) of 320 Pg C until the end of the millennium under an extended RCP 4.5 CO2 emissions scenario. However, the acidity temporarily stored at depth resurfaces primarily around the Southern Ocean via ocean circulation and causes regional CO2 outgassing. Furthermore, too intense downwelling of warm surface water leads to an increase in ocean interior temperatures causing further Earth system feedbacks and accelerates the re-emergence of downwelled acidity to the surface. However, the extent to which this re-emergence causes CO2 outgassing into the atmosphere is emissions scenario dependent. This study highlights that large-scale ocean circulation, the investigated time frame, and the future CO2 emission scenario all need to be considered in order to determine the mCDR potential of AD."

The large-scale atmospheric circulation mode, characterized by an extensive and persistent high-pressure (low-pressure) pattern on the Siberia (North America) side, is responsible for the poleward shift of multiyear ice (MYI) replenishment. Associated with the poleward expansion of the multiyear sea ice replenishment, a significant decline in sea ice thickness over the central Arctic and reduced sea ice volume flux via the Fram Strait are identified.

In this study, we propose a quantitative framework that integrates a stochastic advection-diffusion (SAD) model with the value of information (VoI) to design a sensor placement strategy for regional PM2.5 monitoring. Predictions from the SAD model are used to compute the VoI based on a cost function that penalizes misclassifications between model-assigned and observed air quality index values. We apply the framework to the Coastal Bend Region of Texas, where increased development is creating new air quality concerns. We compare three weighting strategies: (1) combined weighting, which accounts for both population density and social vulnerability; (2) vulnerability-focused weighting, which emphasizes socially vulnerable communities regardless of population density; and (3) unweighted VoI, which solely focuses on minimizing assignment error without demographic weighting. With a 10-sensor installation, the combined strategy covered areas with 22%–88% higher population density than the other schemes, whereas the vulnerability-focused strategy reduced uncovered social vulnerability by 6%–19%. Prediction accuracy differed by less than 1.5% across strategies. While differences in outcomes are expected given the distinct objectives, the framework adds value by quantifying these trade-offs and enabling a systematic sensor placement strategy that best aligns with policy goals. The proposed framework is scalable to different sensor types and capable of balancing information gain, population exposure, and social vulnerability, providing a versatile tool to guide sensor network design under resource constraints."

Ex-post evaluation of agri-environmental outcomes of these grant programs, however, is limited. We use satellite data to monitor changes in field-level consumptive water use and greenness (i.e. normalized difference vegetation index), a proxy for agricultural productivity, for the most frequently funded crop-types (almonds, grapes, and walnuts) in two California Department of Food and Agriculture programs. Nearly 600 fields receiving funding during the 2014–2022 period were analyzed using two causal inference methods. Fields that received grants to both upgrade irrigation systems and install irrigation water management sensors showed reduced consumptive water use and greenness by an average of 3.5% and 4.2%, respectively (significant at the 10% level). In contrast, we find that the adoption of only irrigation water management sensors, which are designed to inform irrigation scheduling and management, resulted in an average increase of 4.1% and 4.8% in consumptive water use and greenness respectively (significant at the 5% level). We find negligible effects for either consumptive water use or greenness when both pump efficiency upgrades and sensors were implemented. We further find that grants for compost addition and cover cropping led to small greenness increases of 1.7% and 2.8% respectively (significant at the 10% level) and had insignificant effects on consumptive water use. Our analysis of five agri-environmental program interventions reveals that several practice outcomes may be at odds with stated program goals of reducing water use while maintaining or improving agricultural productivity."

Rapid afforestation with commercial tree plantations is transforming fire-prone savannas and grasslands globally and particularly in tropical South America, yet its effects on fire dynamics remain poorly understood. Using hierarchical models, we analyzed trends in annual burned area within concentric buffers (1–6 km) around each of 44 plantation and 52 grassland sites in Colombia’s Orinoquia region—a savanna grassland forest mosaic undergoing major land-use transitions from the expansion of commercial tree plantations. Plantations reduced burned areas in two ways: order-of-magnitude increases in plantation area reduced burnt area by 15% and plantation sites reduced their burnt area by 2% each year; both results consistent with trees replacing more inflammable grassland vegetation. While the mechanisms behind divergent savanna/plantation fire dynamics remain unresolved and could involve active fuel management and fire response, increased canopy cover, or some combination thereof, this study provides spatially explicit, context-sensitive evidence on how land-use transitions interact with fire regimes with direct relevance for savannas and grasslands management and climate adaptation policy in South America."

This study examines uncertainties in Antarctic precipitation projections using simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 and investigates their underlying sources. We find that uncertainties in precipitation projections are substantially larger than those for surface temperature. Integrated precipitation uncertainties are strongly linked to uncertainties in both global and Antarctic surface temperatures, while atmospheric circulation—particularly the Pacific South American modes—plays a critical role in regional precipitation patterns of precipitation uncertainties. Further analysis reveals that tropical sea surface temperatures contribute to uncertainties in Antarctic precipitation patterns through atmospheric teleconnections. These findings highlight the need to improve polar processes in climate models to reduce uncertainties in Antarctic precipitation projections and better predict ice sheet contributions to sea level rise."

Computationally intensive snow reanalysis products and downscaled climate model projections allow for the estimation of historical and projected changes in snow over ∼4–10 km resolutions, but these resolutions are coarse relative to the scales needed for water supply and flood planning. Fine-scale digital elevation models (DEMs) are widely available but are underutilized to make first-order assessments of snow vulnerability. Here, we leverage DEMs at a 7.5 arc s (∼250 m) resolution, combining these with historical freezing level height estimates from ERA-5 to derive estimates of changes in the snow-receiving area (SRA) and its variability across global mountain ranges. Results show estimated SRA declines in 29% (1.9 million km2) of the global mountain area from 1982–2020; 66% of the mountainous areas had no change over the historical period. At +1.5 °C of warming relative to the pre-industrial control, global mountain SRA would decline by 9.5% (1.0 million km2) relative to recent conditions. This loss would be approximately doubled with +2 °C of warming. In a +4 °C warming scenario, an additional 34% (3.6 million km2) of SRA would be lost beyond the +2 °C case. Across individual mountain ranges, SRA losses can occur nonlinearly with warming, with some locations that have historically had relatively minor SRA losses at risk of substantially larger losses in warmer climates. Analysis using coarser-resolution DEMs can underestimate or overestimate SRA and its rate of loss, with the largest impacts in relatively warm, low-elevation mountain ranges. Results of this work provide estimates of projected loss in SRA at policy-relevant warming levels; inform the resolutions needed for process-based snow modeling; identify snow vulnerability hotspots; and provide a new integrated approach to snow vulnerability assessment that is achievable at global scales and highlights potential nonlinearities from recent trends to a variety of future warming scenarios."

Identifying key actors is important for land use theory and for determining whether tree planting can improve rural livelihoods while contributing to environmental goals. To date, tree-planting analyses focus on obvious actors: large-scale businesses (plantations) and rural smallholders (woodlots). However, absentee, urban-based domestic investors are also engaged. Using southern Tanzania as a case study, we attribute tree planting across plantations and woodlots then analyze the potential contribution of the absentee landowners (absentee treefarms). We quantified plantations’ extent by creating and manually verifying a spatial database of planted areas (ca. 2019). We estimated woodlots’ extent by performing a bootstrap extrapolation of average woodlot area based on field surveys of 3436 smallholders across 163 villages. We estimated absentee treefarms’ extent based on interviews with village leaders (n = 36). We corroborated plantations, woodlots, and absentee treefarms against total planted tree cover as observed from remote sensing. The plantations database corresponded well to remote sensing (R = 0.82), but less so for woodlots (R = 0.48). A linear model with only plantations and woodlots explained 38% of the remotely sensed planted tree cover while one that included absentee treefarms explained 54%. Unexplained variation is partly due to omission errors for woodlots: 57% of villages (n = 88) had more woodlots based on interview estimates than based on remote sensing analysis. Villages with far more remotely sensed planted trees compared to interview estimates (11%, n = 17) included absentee treefarm sites. Our findings reveal the role of absentee, urban-based domestic investors in tree planting. More broadly, we show that trees planted in rural areas, even in small patches (5–500 ha) are not necessarily owned by rural residents. Land use attribution must incorporate absentee owners. Similarly, funding for tree planting, particularly when intended to alleviate rural poverty, must address who benefits and not just where tree planting occurs. We recommend triangulating remote sensing with field assessments to attribute ownership to improve the equity and efficacy of tree-planting campaigns."

While aerosols constitute a significant air pollutant that impairs PV generation efficiency, few studies have examined how China’s clean air action (CAA) plan has influenced solar PV performance. To address this gap, we employ the PVLIB-Python model to quantify PV capacity factors and power generation changes across China, due to the CAA plan in China from 2013 to 2020. We find that improved air quality has substantially enhanced PV generation, particularly in eastern China, generating up to 41.3 TWh additional electricity per year, estimated with current PV capacity. The largest increases are in provinces such as Shandong and Henan, with heavier air pollution and higher PV installation. By employing multiple CMIP6 models, we also estimate potential future PV power generation changes in China. We find that with sustainable development and strong climate change mitigation policies, the reduced air pollution and increased solar radiation can potentially increase the PV power generation by 37.4–52.6 TWh per year by the 2050s, without even considering the newly installed PV facilities."

However, previous GLOF studies often neglected GLOFs’ return periods when evaluating their magnitudes. In this study, we developed a probabilistic modeling framework to quantify the peak discharges and flood volumes of potential GLOFs with return periods ranging from 10 to 500 years for the eastern Tibetan Plateau with over 11 000 glacial lakes. The results indicate that the GLOF peak discharge increases from 0.5 × 103 m3 s−1 at a 10 year return period to over ∼8.6 × 103 m3 s−1 at a 500 year return period, whereas the flood volume increases from ∼1.42 × 106 m3 to ∼20.17 × 106 m3. Future climate change will likely increase the GLOF magnitude, with peak discharge (100 year return period) increasing from ∼3.3 × 103 m3 s−1 in 2015 to ∼3.8 × 103 m3 s−1 in 2100 under the RCP8.5. We further evaluated the GLOF magnitude along the Sichuan–Tibet Railway and identified railway segments crossing the Yarlung Zangbo, Salween, and Jinsha rivers as high hazard areas, where the projected peak discharge exceeded ∼2.5 × 103 m3 s−1 and flood volume surpassed ∼9.1 × 106 m3 in 2100 under RCP8.5. These results underscore the urgent need to integrate GLOF hazards into infrastructure design and enhance the predictive capacity for potential GLOF impacts on river ecosystems, water quality and landscape evolution."

However, the impacts of climate changes and human activities on historical and future GWS remain insufficiently quantified. Here, we integrate remote sensing, Earth system modeling, and artificial intelligence (AI) to assess historical trends and project future evolutions in GWS across HMA. Remote sensing reveals that approximately 69% of the regions experienced GWS declines during 2003–2020, with annual losses totaling −24.2 Gt, particularly in densely populated and irrigated downstream basins such as Ganges–Brahmaputra and Indus. Using a Transformer-based framework, we attribute 47% of GWS variability to direct climate drivers and an additional 15% to cryospheric processes, while human activities contribute up to 38% of declines. The identified GWS decline in downstream basins along with its intensifying pattern is further corroborated by 2554 in situ groundwater well observations. Our data-driven projections further indicate a sustained climate-induced threat to groundwater sustainability in high-risk basins through the end of the century when maintaining current water-use levels. While cryospheric melt may temporarily offset losses until the 2060s, this buffering effect will diminish over time and lead to accelerated depletion under climate warming. This study demonstrates the value of combining remote sensing with explainable AI to improve groundwater assessment and support climate-resilient water management in high mountain regions worldwide."

This study presents two novel analytical methods for nitro compound quantification without the need for compound-specific standards: a batch UV254 photolysis coupled with colorimetry for total nitro, and liquid chromatography with postcolumn photolysis (LC-PCUV) for individual compounds. Both methods rely on photolytic nitrite formation as a proxy for nitro compounds, yielding average molar nitrite yields of 68 ± 17% for aliphatic compounds and 11 ± 11% for aromatic compounds. The methods demonstrated high sensitivity in complex matrices, achieving detection limits down to a few nM nitro-equivalent when combined with solid phase extraction. A proof-of-concept ozonation experiment with model amines and amino acids confirmed the applicability of the methods, providing new insights into γ-aminobutyric acid ozonation. Notably, it is reported here for the first time that over 20% of amine-containing moieties in extracted natural organic matter can be converted to nitro during ozonation. Significant nitro concentrations (140–180 nM) were also detected in wastewater effluents and found to further increase upon ozonation. Together, these methods offer valuable tools to investigate the fate of reactive nitrogen moieties and nitro formation, including (halo)nitroalkanes during oxidative water treatment."

To assess exposure risks, we conducted indoor and outdoor VOCs sampling at 22 households near the Palisades and Eaton Fires across three phases: active burning with less than 50% containment (January 8–15), active burning period with more than 50% containment (January 24–31), and postfire (February 11–18). Outdoor benzene concentrations peaked during Phase 1, with a median (interquartile range) of 0.38 (0.27) ppb, decreased over time, and remained below the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment health benchmarks. Compared with the active burning period, indoor-to-outdoor ratios of m,p-xylene (p = 0.004), carbon tetrachloride (p = 0.002), and heptane (p = 0.02) were significantly higher in the postfire period. Elevated VOC levels were particularly evident in uninhabited homes within burn zones, suggesting ongoing indoor emissions from smoke-impacted materials. These findings raise concerns about indoor air quality postwildfire and the potential for prolonged exposure, underscoring the need for targeted mitigation and ongoing monitoring to protect public health during recovery."

This commentary synthesizes lessons from program implementation, highlighting that institutional and financial barriers, rather than technical limitations, now constrain the scaling of this EO‐driven climate resilience mechanism. While the program successfully integrated satellite data with transparent triggers and financial instruments, its sustainability depended on financial commitment extending beyond experimental phases.

ECAPE modifies traditional CAPE to account for the dependence of entrainment on the vertical wind shear, the lifted condensation level (LCL) height, and the properties of a cloud's surrounding atmosphere. ECAPE shows stronger pattern correlations with global regions of intense thunderstorms than previous metrics for updraft speed. In these regions, large CAPE, large shear, and high LCLs conspire to produce wide updrafts that are shielded from the negative effects of dry‐air entrainment. ECAPE more skillfully discriminates intense thunderstorms from their less intense counterparts than other metrics commonly used in climatology and climate change studies of thunderstorms. We provide evidence that the well‐known land‐sea contrast in thunderstorm intensity is a consequence of larger CAPE and higher LCL heights over land than over the ocean."

 Nitrogen is indispensable for global food production and ecosystem carbon sequestration, but excess nitrogen leads to water eutrophication, soil acidification and air pollution. Atmospheric nitrogen deposition is a key yet uncertain component of the biogeochemical cycle. Currently, global networks monitoring particulate nitrogen dry deposition rely mainly on measured concentrations and modelled dry deposition velocities, which remain poorly constrained. Here we develop a spatially explicit dataset by integrating observation-constrained size distribution and dry deposition mechanisms to re-evaluate atmospheric nitrogen deposition across China. We reveal that atmospheric chemistry models underestimate the particle size of fine-mode nitrogen-containing aerosols in China by more than twofold. Additionally, dry particle deposition velocity estimates with different mechanisms diverge by up to two orders of magnitude. Our corrections indicate that atmospheric chemistry models and China’s observation network underestimate particulate nitrogen dry deposition by 2–5 times. Furthermore, most Earth system models underestimate particulate dry deposition of ammonium, a major nitrogen species, by 31%–98%. By integrating these corrections into the Community Land Model, we demonstrate that the effect of nitrogen deposition on China’s terrestrial net ecosystem productivity may have been underestimated by 9%–13%. As China contributes nearly 20% of global nitrogen deposition, its impact on terrestrial carbon sinks and ecosystem health could be greater than previously recognized. Atmospheric chemistry models and observation networks in China may underestimate particulate dry nitrogen deposition due to inadequate representation of the particle size distribution and dry deposition mechanisms, impacting nitrogen deposition modelling used for public health decisions and climate change projections."

Using a high-resolution multiyear dataset in China, researchers show the historically massive contributions of these emissions during past decades of rapid urbanization and the potential risks for future climate goals. 
 Long-term effects of massive building material use in China, which experienced intense urbanization in the past two decades, remain insufficiently explored. Here, to fill these gaps, we developed a high-resolution time-series database of building material stocks from 2000 to 2019 and found that China held 15% of the global stock, which accounted for 19% of the country’s total carbon emissions. Although rapid urbanization generally increased per capita building material stock, the extent of this increase varied across cities and building types. We show that the growth rate has slowed since 2016; however, it remains challenging to simultaneously achieve both carbon-neutrality and urbanization goals. Future urbanization in China is projected to consume 12.5% of the nation’s total 1.5 °C carbon budget and 37.4% of its average annual budget allocation. Addressing these challenges requires targeted urban interventions, such as aligning low-carbon material production with projected regional demand and strategically planning materials recycling from future building demolitions. Reducing the embodied carbon emissions of building material stock is essential for mitigation.

A study now finds that emissions could be halved cost-effectively by 2050 through targeted and prioritized measures, with benefits far outweighing costs. 
 Excess ammonia (NH3) emissions from human activities pose severe threats to global ecosystems and human health. Although urgent control of NH3 emissions is needed, a comprehensive quantification of mitigation strategies and their cost-effectiveness is lacking on a global scale. Here we employ a multi-model framework to evaluate 32 mitigation measures across 7 sectors in 185 countries. Our analysis reveals that strategic implementation of technological and non-technological (policy and behavioural) measures could reduce global NH3 emissions by up to 60% at an average cost of US$7.4 per kilogram of NH3. The estimated implementation cost of US$274 ± 116 billion is far outweighed by the resulting environmental, health and resource benefits, which we indicatively estimate at US$722 ± 302 billion. Priority action in China and India could yield the largest net gains, whereas Sub-Saharan Africa faces limited cost-effectiveness owing to structural and economic barriers. Future scenarios indicate that ambitious implementation pathways could halve NH3 emissions by 2050, whereas weak climate action and inadequate nitrogen regulations would drive continued emission growth, leading to substantial environmental deterioration. These findings highlight both the feasibility and urgency of integrating NH3 control into multi-objective policies for food security, air quality and sustainable development. Man-made ammonia emissions have harmful effects on human health and ecosystems, yet global mitigation strategies remain underexploited. A study now finds that emissions could be halved cost-effectively by 2050 through targeted and prioritized measures, with benefits far outweighing costs."

 High spatiotemporal resolution land surface temperature (LST) is essential for climate-impact studies, particularly for urban thermal environment analyses and vegetation phenology tracking. However, current satellite sensors exhibit inherent hardware trade-offs: Sentinel-2 (S2) provides high-resolution (10 m/5 day) optical observations without thermal capability, whereas Landsat-8/9 (L8/9), equipped with both optical and thermal sensors, suffers from coarser resolution (30 m/16 day). This configuration fails to meet the demand for fine spatial and dense temporal surface thermal monitoring. To address this gap, we propose a novel fusion framework for high spatiotemporal resolution LST generation (fHiSTR-LST). It first applies a deep-learning-based spatiotemporal fusion to densify reflectance data, then performs a spatial-spectral fusion to generate high-resolution LST. By synergizing L8/9 and S2 data, our approach reliably produces 10 m spatial-resolution LST across three overpass scenarios (joint, L8/9-only, S2-only), thus achieving an effective ∼3-day temporal resolution. Cross-validations between upscaled LST predictions and native L8/9 LST demonstrate fHiSTR-LST's robust performance across eight study areas worldwide (mean R = 0.90, RMSE = 1.17 K). More significantly, ground-truth validation—previously unaddressed—confirms its satisfactory accuracy (mean R = 0.97, RMSE = 3.45 K). The combined validation shows that fHiSTR-LST outperforms the state-of-the-art by 13 % in R and reduces RMSE by 9 %. Finally, we illustrate two applications—small-area vegetation-phenology tracking and fine-scale urban thermal-pattern delineation—which collectively showcase fHiSTR-LST's capability to resolve subtle surface thermal variations. Our study bridges a critical gap in generating high spatiotemporal resolution LST from satellite imagery, a capability crucial for investigating the nuanced effects of global warming."

 Liangping District, located in the northeastern part of the Sichuan Basin (SCB), is a representative site for studying black carbon (BC) aerosol pollution within the basin. Field measurements of BC mass concentration were conducted continuously from March to May 2021 using an Aethalometer (AE33). The mean BC mass concentration was determined to be 2.4 μg m−3. The aerosol optical properties were derived through application of the Aethalometer model, yielding an average absorption coefficient of 36.7 ± 20.1 Mm−1 at 520 nm with a corresponding absorption Ångström exponent (AAE) of 1.40 ± 0.12. During the observation period, two six-day pollution events (designated as Event Mar and Event May) were recorded, with PM2.5 concentrations exceeding the first-class ambient air quality standards threshold of 35 μg m−3. The maximum AAE was 1.70 during Event Mar compared to 1.43 during Event May. The elevated AAE value in Event Mar suggested increased biomass burning constituted a significant pollution source, whereas the lower AAE during Event May reflected a mixed source dominated by fossil fuel combustion. Non-parametric wind regression (NWR) analysis revealed that high BC concentrations were spatially concentrated in the southwestern region during Event Mar, whereas during Event May, elevated BC levels originated from multiple directions. Concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) analysis indicated that during Event Mar, long-range transport played a more dominant role, whereas local emissions were the primary pollution source during Event May. The study of the two pollution events identified the primary sources of BC, providing a method for analyzing the characteristics of aerosol pollution in SCB and offering a basis for developing pollution control measures."

Using 12-hour satellite-derived fire tracking data from 2012 to 2023, we show that the merging of separate ignitions into multi-ignition complexes is a key process amplifying fire size and destructive potential across temperate and boreal ecoregions. Multi-ignition fires account for 31% of the burned area in California and 59% in the Arctic-boreal domain, spread faster and persist longer than single-ignition fires, and disproportionately contribute to extreme fire years in California, Canada, and Siberia. They also generate stronger atmospheric feedbacks, produce more pyrocumulonimbus events, and strain firefighting capacity by dispersing suppression resources. Recognizing and accounting for fire-merging dynamics are critical for improving wildfire prediction, risk assessment, and management."

Compared with other types of micelles, our results demonstrated that amphiphilic micelles formed by DSPE-PCB [carboxybetaine polymer conjugated to 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DB)] exhibited superior physicochemical properties for mucus penetration. Furthermore, we found that incorporating a conformationally adaptive azobenzene (Azo) intermediate into DB further enhanced this effect by modulating mechanical properties of micelle. By tuning DB/DAB ratios during self-assembly, we generated a micelle library with adjustable deformability (1- to 40-fold). The enhanced mucus penetration ability led to a nearly fourfold reduction in the retention time of DSPE-Azo-PCB (DAB) micelles in respiratory mucus, significantly increasing drug accumulation in lung tissue and reducing irritation to the respiratory tract. This study integrates both the physicochemical and mechanical properties of micelles to optimize mucus penetration, offering previously unidentified strategies for the development of inhalation formulations."

Yet, its potential warming effects remain unquantified globally, with mechanisms unclear. Using high-resolution satellite and climate data, we provide the first global assessment of vegetation’s temperature regulation across 761 megacities across 105 countries, uncovering a paradox: cooling weakens in arid environments; and in 22% of cities with <1000-millimeter annual precipitation, vegetation, particularly grasslands and croplands, causes net warming. This results from lower albedo and reduced heat storage outweighing limited evapotranspiration in arid regions. During extreme heat, trees fail to cool 25% of cities, while grasslands and croplands fail in 71 and 82%, respectively, due to reduced evapotranspiration under high vapor pressure deficits and impeded canopy conductance. Climate-adaptive greening and irrigation are critical, while high-albedo surfaces may better mitigate heat in water-scarce cities. Misguided greening risks are worsening urban warming."

Here, we reveal the instability issue of current cesium-formamidinium lead triiodide (CsxFA1−xPbI3) inks whose aggregation and precipitation tendencies are induced by excessively strong solvent-lead-halide coordination. By modulating coordination strength between precursor salts and solvents, we identify solvent coordination-dispersion equilibrium as the governing factor for ink stability and develop a stable ink that exhibits a remarkable increase in the shelf life. It effectively tunes ink drying and film crystallization, resulting in blade-coated perovskite films with excellent uniformity and low defect density. This enhancement led to increased aperture efficiency of ambient-fabricated p-i-n perovskite modules to 23.5%. The resultant devices also exhibit high durability, and 99% of the initial PCE was retained after 1700 hours of maximum power point tracking following the ISOS-L-2 standard protocol."

Desalination, particularly through reverse osmosis (RO), has become a critical method of producing fresh water from saline sources. However, thin-film composite (TFC) polyamide (PA) RO membranes, the industrial desalination standard, have a high propensity for biofilm formation, which leads to biofouling, reducing efficiency and increasing energy demand. Ozone disinfection is a simple, effective method to control biofilm development; however, PA membranes undergo chemical degradation when exposed to oxidizing disinfectants, even at very low concentrations. This work presents a novel approach to enhancing the durability of TFC-PA membranes against ozone. This was achieved by applying ultrathin alumina coatings via atomic layer deposition (ALD) on the membrane surface, creating a protective layer that provides active and passive defense against oxidative damage. The thin-film alumina-coated membrane at optimal coating demonstrated 5-fold higher tolerance to ozone exposure than uncoated membranes. They also maintained stable water permeate flux and salt rejection after prolonged filtration and effectively prevented biofilm formation. These findings offer a promising pathway to enhancing the sustainability of RO membranes by addressing critical barriers to their long-term desalination performance, thereby contributing to addressing the problem of global water scarcity."

The novel framework presented correlates specific differential absorbance at 254 nm (Sp-ΔUV254), which measures the change in UV254 due to chlorination normalized by initial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, with critical water quality parameters such as chlorine demand, DBP formation, size-fractionated NOM, and lignin to enhance mechanistic understandings of DBP precursor dynamics. To evaluate the impact of a storm on the DBP precursor dynamics, samples were collected from the Neversink River (NY) during a high-flow event. The formation of total trihalomethanes (THMs), or specific trihalomethanes (Sp-THM) when normalized by initial DOC, strongly correlated to Sp-ΔUV254. The pre- and postchlorinated samples’ quotients of absorbances at 250 and 365 nm (E2/E3) yielded a strong correlation despite a decreased ΔUV254 due to chlorination, suggesting dissolved organic matter transformation to less aromatic structures, in agreement with size exclusion chromatography (SEC) data. A novel SEC-DOC technique showed THM precursors increased during the rising limb of the storm with a predominant molecular weight range of 2000–10,000 Da.

This study investigated the foliar interactions between negatively charged NPs and two mangroves with contrasting salt-regulation strategies: the salt-secreting Aegiceras corniculatum and the salt-excluding K. candel. The findings indicated that the salt glands in A. corniculatum leaves functioned as NP accumulation hotspots, with a 53.2%–54.1% higher particle density than adjacent epidermal cells. This preferential retention was attributed to the glandular micromorphology and π–π stacking–mediated interfacial adhesion. Critically, salt glands provided entry points for NP internalization in A. corniculatum, allowing rootward translocation at 0.378–0.547 mg kg–1 d–1. Conversely, the absence of salt glands in K. candel resulted in complete NP interception by its cuticular layer, restricting internal migration. The differential NP localization patterns further induced species-specific photosynthetic impairment mechanisms. Cuticular NP shielding inhibited the light reaction in K. candel by reducing photon capture efficiency and disrupting electron transport. However, salt gland–facilitated NP internalization triggered dark reaction failure in A. corniculatum, as evidenced by 35.1 to 68.3% downregulation of carbon fixation genes. Our results reveal the role of salt-secreting mangroves as biological concentrators in the global NP cycle and bridge microscale plastic–plant interactions with macroscale carbon–climate feedbacks, redefining mangrove ecosystems as critical nodes in the plastisphere."

Here we introduce a hierarchical exposure framework that tracks the structural and chemical transformations in the archetypal zirconium MOF UiO-66 across sequential compartments─atmospheric gases, air, aqueous media and a biological host─and resolves how prior exposures condition or prime subsequent transformations. Using synchrotron-based spectroscopy, we find that oxidative/reactive gases leave the Zr-carboxylate nodes essentially intact, whereas exposure to environmentally relevant aqueous media initiates partial shifts in local Zr coordination and introduces oxygen into the pores─with transformation extent governed by the chemistry of the environmental matrices. Strikingly, acute exposure (24 h) to the water flea Daphnia magna drives profound framework degradation and respeciation to Zr hydroxide species. Microfocus XRF maps show that Zr is highly localized in the animal’s digestive tract, and region-specific XANES confirms uniform speciation across its tissues. Our findings establish a paradigm shifting cross-compartment transformation hierarchy in which biological processes can dominate the fate of stable MOFs even when abiotic exposures appear benign. Thus, organism-level biotransformation should be performed as a necessary part of environmental safety assessments and materials design."

Observation-based (top-down) verification of this phase-out requires quantification of the CFC-12 emissions using atmospheric observations, which have been notably lacking post-2020 for China. In this study, 6814 new high-frequency in situ atmospheric observations of CFC-12 from three Chinese stations in 2024 were analyzed. Combining these observations with inverse modeling, we quantified China’s most recent CFC-12 emissions and revealed a 72% decline, from 12.7 ± 2.2 gigagrams per year (Gg yr–1) in 2016 to 3.6 ± 0.8 Gg yr–1 in 2024. We also developed a new bottom-up inventory, which generally reconciles the discrepancy between observation-based estimates and previous inventories. From a global perspective, this study provides the first country-specific, observation-based estimates of CFC-12 emissions for 2024, accounting for 22.6% of the global CFC-12 emissions. In contrast, for other countries, no observation-based CFC-12 emissions exist, or only a few pre-2022 data are available. Approximately three-quarters (77.4%) of global CFC-12 emissions remain unattributed. These findings highlight both China’s success in mitigating CFC-12 emissions, contributing to ozone layer protection and climate mitigation, and the need for enhanced emission quantification across other regions."

However, research on HV-POPs remains limited, particularly in rapidly urbanizing regions, constraining understanding of their sources, environmental fate, and risks. This study investigated 52 HV-POPs, including Stockholm Convention-listed POPs like hexachlorobutadiene (HCBD) and hexa-/pentachlorobenzene (HCB/PeCB), and nonlisted HV-POPs such as volatile methylsiloxanes (VMS) and chlorinated nitrobenzenes (CNBs), using active air samplers in six major cities across Asia and Africa. The median total concentrations of HV-POPs were highest in Guangzhou (351 ng/m3), followed by Kuala Lumpur (167 ng/m3), Accra (82.4 ng/m3), Dhaka (73.3 ng/m3), Nairobi (44.9 ng/m3), and Islamabad (33.5 ng/m3). VMS dominated at all sites, accounting for 84 ± 18% of total HV-POPs, up to 2–5 orders of magnitude higher than other compounds. Source analysis showed VMS emissions in Guangzhou were mainly from industrial activities, while in the other cities, they were from usage of personal care products. Inhalation risk assessments indicated negligible noncarcinogenic and carcinogenic risks at all sites.

The Central China water tower (CCWT) is the key source region feeding the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, and its runoff is indispensable for the surrounding mega‐city clusters. Here we present a reconstruction of CCWT runoff depth (RD) back to 1595 CE, based on a new dendrochronological network including 100 tree‐ring sampling sites and an ensemble averaging approach that combines multiple regression models. Comparison of this reconstruction with similar records from six water tower regions along the Pacific Rim (Mongolian Plateau, Tibetan Plateau TP, Great Dividing Range, Southern and Northern Rocky Mountains, Andes Mountains) revealed that the CCWT provide the most stable water supply, while the TP to be most susceptible to extreme runoff events. Twenty‐first century projections indicate generally increasing runoff across most Pacific Rim water towers, whereas the Northern Rocky Mountains are projected to decline substantially. We attribute the differences in runoff variability and projected trends across Pacific Rim water towers to their distinct geographies and synoptic climatic conditions. The long‐term runoff reconstructions and projected changes highlighted in this study provide insights for adaptive management strategies in China and all other regions relying on supply from mountain water towers."

Two main approaches exist: dynamical downscaling using high‐resolution regional climate models, and statistical downscaling based on historical relationships between large‐scale and local variables. In a recent analysis of five dynamically downscaled simulations over the western United States, Koszuta et al. (2024, https://doi.org/10.1029/2023gl107298) found that warming weakens orographic influence on winter precipitation, damping increases on windward slopes and amplifying them in rain‐shadowed regions. Here we show that this effect is robust across seasons and multiple dynamically downscaled ensembles, and is more pronounced at higher model resolutions. However, it is absent in projections from a widely used statistical model (LOCA2), even when trained on high‐resolution future simulations (LOCA2‐Hybrid). This highlights a key limitation of many statistical downscaling methods: their preservation of parent GCM trends, which usually fail to capture emergent changes in orographic precipitation patterns."

Since concurrent branches in positive CG strokes are not usual, positive UI (+UI) strokes were never reported yet. This study presents the first observations of +UI strokes. They were recorded in Utah, USA, using high‐speed cameras. Although +UI strokes share similarities with negative UI strokes, their initiation mechanisms are fundamentally different. +UI strokes result from intense recoil leader activity with their positive leader speed one order of magnitude slower than the average of typical CG downward positive leaders. Additionally, multiple +UI strokes can occur within the same flash. Finally, we gather all the information learned from the case studies to propose the basic formation mechanisms of +UI strokes."

Recent observations have revealed a distinctly weak overturning in this basin, attributed to compensating effects of temperature and salinity anomalies on density. However, it remains unclear whether these effects are consistent under varying hydrographic conditions and whether they subsequently impact overturning variability. By combining moored observations and historical hydrographic data, we demonstrate a coherent response of the Labrador Sea overturning to salinity anomalies over recent decades. Notably, a strengthened overturning in the late 2010s can be attributed to subsurface fresh anomalies advected into the basin by the boundary currents, which are linked to large‐scale freshening that began in the late 2000s. Our findings underscore the necessity of continuously monitoring boundary salinity and temperature anomalies to capture ongoing changes in the Labrador Sea."

However, the local and global drivers and variability of mangrove CH4 emissions remain poorly understood. Here, we quantify water‐atmosphere CH4 emissions over hourly, daily, and weekly time scales in an Australian mangrove ecosystem. We then combine our new observations with earlier data sets to link temperature and mangrove CH4 emissions on the global scale. The water‐atmosphere CH4 emissions were partially controlled by temperature on both local and global scales. One degree warming increased mangrove water‐atmosphere CH4 emissions by ∼23% locally and ∼13% globally. Globally scaled water‐atmosphere CH4 emissions (0.07–0.10 Tg C yr−1) currently offset 6%–8% of mangrove carbon burial. CH4 emissions are predicted to increase by 10%–33% by 2100 under global warming scenarios and tropicalization. Therefore, mangrove CH4 emissions should be considered in blue carbon assessments in the context of global warming."

Using complex network theory and random forest models, this study analyzed the spatial synchronization characteristics, regional drivers, and propagation patterns of weekly SM drought events across China from 1979 to 2019. Results revealed drought events displayed higher spatial synchronization in eastern Tibet, northern Shaanxi, and southeastern and northeastern China, with average degree centrality (DC) exceeding 250. The drivers of drought event synchronization exhibited regional heterogeneity: precipitation (P, 24.1%), potential evapotranspiration (PET, 15.2%), and atmospheric pressure (PRS, 10.8%) were dominant in western China; P, zonal wind speed at 10 m height (WIN_10v), and terrain gradient contributed more to DC simulation in the northeastern region, with an average contribution of 7.7%; river area (RiA) was the primary factor affecting drought synchrony in southern China, contributing 15.1%, which was 2.4–3 times higher than relative humidity (RHU) and WIN_10v. Drought propagation analysis identified source regions in western Xinjiang and northern Tibet while sink zones were concentrated in eastern Tibet, western Sichuan, northern Guizhou, northeastern Jiangxi, and southeastern Heilongjiang Provinces. Droughts originating from northern Tibet predominantly propagated along the south‐southeast (SSE) direction, with a strength of 90 and distances ranging from 1,500 to 1,800 km.

The different states of coupling between low‐level clouds and the surface are uncertain, primarily over continental regions, where complex thermodynamics complicates their investigation. This study uses observations from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement User Facility to explore cloud‐surface coupling and perform a climatological analysis of this interaction in five countries across three continents. The results reveal consistent coupling thresholds and average percentages across the five sites, with coupled clouds accounting for 66% of the cases and decoupled clouds for 34%. Thermodynamic and dynamic evaluations show distinct differences between coupled and decoupled clouds. Coupled clouds are characterized by humid environments, in which vertical motions connect the surface and lower atmosphere to the cloud base, conditions that favor the formation of boundary layer clouds. Decoupled clouds prefer to occur in a drier and colder environment with vertical motions inside the boundary layer being detached from the cloud base, under which boundary layer clouds are hard to form. Coupled clouds peak during warmer hours and seasons, and vice versa for decoupled clouds. This study underscores the complexity of cloud‐land‐surface interactions and paves the way for further investigations into cloud formation and evolution under different atmospheric environments."

 The projected increase in the sea surface temperature (SST) into the 21st century exhibits a robust southeastern minimum (SEM) pattern in the subtropical Pacific. Despite the agreement between observations and climate models, this pattern remains poorly addressed, with gaps in the proposed mechanisms. Here, we discover a novel air-sea interaction responsible for SEM formation, associated with the changes in the South Pacific subtropical anticyclone (SPSA) and seeded by both the direct CO2 effect and poleward expansion of the tropics. A spatially uniform SST increase leads to anomalous southeasterly winds that can cause cooling in the southern SEM region because of a southwestward shift in the SPSA. With direct CO2 forcing and SST pattern change, an SPSA intensification extends these wind patterns further north to cover the entire SEM. During extension, an anomalous anticyclone is generated by the negative SST anomaly and is vertically inclined southwards by tropospheric warming in the subtropics, due to distinct atmospheric dynamics associated with increasing dry stability. This drives evaporative heat loss over the previously cooled ocean and sustains the SEM SST-wind complex, which is enhanced by cloud feedback. Such an interactive loop is manifested as a single hemisphere wind-evaporation-SST feedback, rather than a cross-equatorial process."

 Carbonyl sulfide (COS) is gaining interest as a proxy for gross primary productivity (GPP). Thinning of the Hyytiälä (Finland) forest in the winter of 2019–2020 altered the response of COS fluxes to environmental conditions in the summer of 2021. For the first time, extended periods of ecosystem-scale COS emissions were observed in a boreal forest. The warm and dry conditions in the summer of 2021 reduced the COS uptake by the canopy and elevated soil abiotic COS production. However, the reduction in canopy uptake and the increase in soil production do not fully explain the observed ecosystem-level emissions. The analysis suggests an unidentified, homogeneously distributed COS source in the eddy covariance footprint area, potentially from the photodegradation of forest floor litter and cutting residue from thinning. Such a source in a boreal forest stand warrants further source apportionment studies to effectively use COS as a proxy for GPP."

Here we revealed the potential distribution of red snow algal blooms in the Antarctic South Shetland Islands between 2018 and 2024. A supervised machine learning approach was applied to 45 cloud-free Sentinel-2 images, using spectral information obtained from a drone-mounted hyperspectral sensor to monitor bloom extent across the entire archipelago.

 Effective control of ambient respirable particulate matter (PM10, particles with aerodynamic diameters less than 10 μm) is essential for air quality management for public health protection. Achieving this requires targeted strategies that address both fine particles (PM2.5, less than 2.5 μm) and coarse particles (PMcoarse, between 2.5 and 10 μm). In this study, we conducted a two-year field monitoring campaign in an urban residential area in Hong Kong to simultaneously characterize the chemical compositions and sources of PM2.5 and PMcoarse. Nearly half (46 %) of PM10 mass was associated with PMcoarse, with individual species exhibiting distinct distribution patterns across the two size fractions. Transition metals known for their roles in PM oxidative potential (e.g., Mn and Cu) were found to be evenly distributed between fine and coarse modes, underscoring the need for further assessments of their size-resolved health effects. Source apportionment using positive matrix factorization showed that PM2.5 was mainly influenced by secondary sulfate and nitrate formation, road traffic and biomass/coal combustion, whereas PMcoarse was dominated by soil/industrial dust, construction/copper-rich dust and sea salt. Backward air mass trajectory analysis identified a 28 μg/m3 increase in PM10 source contribution under continental air mass influences compared to marine air masses. Coarse-mode soil and industrial dust, primarily transported from inner-continental regions, accounted for 40 % of this excess contribution. This work highlights the growing importance of addressing PMcoarse on a regional scale in future air quality research and control strategies to meet PM10 air quality targets."

 Tropical cyclones (TCs) can significantly influence tropospheric ozone (O3) in coastal regions, with impacts closely tied to TC tracks. Based on long-term observational records, this study examined O3 formation and sources in Nanjing under TCs from July to October over 2014–2023. During this period, the number of O3-polluted days increased from 43 to 80. Notably, between July and October, TCs and O3 pollution episodes frequently coincided, with ∼49 % of O3 pollution occurring on TC days. Applying a finite mixture algorithm, TCs affecting Nanjing were classified into three tracks: northwest track (NT), turning track (TT) and westward track (WT). NT occurred earliest; TT had the fewest TC days; WT was most frequent but developed latest. NT TCs located near (128°E, 21°N), about 800 km from Nanjing with intensities above severe tropical storm, were most frequently associated with O3 pollution, whereas TT and WT corresponded to TCs near (126°E, 24°N) and (111°E, 21°N) with varying intensities. Across all TC tracks, O3 formation and accumulation were favored (46.6 % to 61.6 %) by higher temperature (5.1 % to 20.8 %), lower relative humidity (−25.8 % to −16.6 %), reduced cloud cover (−21.0 % to −14.1 %), lower wind speed (−24.5 % to −7.6 %), and elevated concentrations of NO2 (14.1 % to 15.2 %) and CO (12.3 % to 18.5 %). However, O3 pollution varied with the TC's location. In the early phases, southeastern peripheral airflow transported O3 and its precursors from the Shanghai–northern Zhejiang–Nanjing corridor, contributing over 50 % of the total. As TCs moved, NT TCs facilitated short-range transport from central Anhui (∼23.4 %), TT TCs enhanced northward transport from Shandong and Jiangsu (∼54.0 %), and WT TCs drove long-range transport from Jiangxi and even Guangzhou (∼19.6 %). These findings suggest that the movement and positioning of TCs can significantly influence O3 pollutions, providing valuable insights for O3 pollution control in coastal cities."

Although its glaciers share the same plateau, they retreat at different speeds and times. One reason for these differences lies in the unknown landscape beneath the ice. To reveal it, we used helicopter-based radar to measure the ice thickness and map the bedrock of Viedma, Upsala, and Perito Moreno Glaciers. 
 We present the first helicopter-borne ground-penetrating radar dataset over Glaciar Viedma, Upsala, and Perito Moreno, three of the largest outlet glaciers of the Southern Patagonian Icefield in South America. The dataset comprises 116.021 individual ice-thickness measurements along 232 km of flight tracks. Data were acquired during two campaigns in March and April 2022 as well as in October 2024 using a 25 MHz shielded broadband antenna deployed as a helicopter sling load. For the first time, we reveal the complex subglacial topography of these glaciers in their lower regions and measured bed reflections at Glaciar Upsala in depths of up to 800 m. The newly obtained measurements were incorporated into an ice-thickness reconstruction method to derive glacier-wide ice-thickness distribution maps and the corresponding bedrock topography. The latter exerts primary control on the response of water-terminating glaciers to a changing climate. Our 100-m gridded ice-thickness maps indicate that the three glaciers had a combined ice volume of 831.14 km³ in the year 2000. The dataset and the well-constrained glacier-wide grids provide a valuable basis for future studies aiming to better understand the mechanisms driving glacier retreat and the susceptibility of these large outlet glaciers to climate change.

 Coastal wetland vegetation plays a vital role in shoreline protection and ecosystem management, highlighting the need for accurate and high-resolution mapping of these unique and vulnerable habitats. Here, we present CCAV-10m, the first publicly available annual species-level coastal wetland dataset for China at 10 m resolution (2016–2023).

This study presents a high‐resolution VCP‐gridded emission inventory in China, incorporating an updated method for emission estimation, localized source profiles, and spatial allocation. Results reveal that VCP emissions amounted to 13.88 Tg in 2022, dominated by coatings and adhesives. Industrial and domestic VCPs contribute two‐thirds and one‐third of total VCP emissions, respectively. Oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) and aromatics constitute over 70% of total emissions and ozone formation potential (OFP), with aromatics (3.86 Tg, primarily from coatings) contributing 17.45 Tg to OFP. The component emissions of VCPs in China exhibit distinct characteristics compared to the United States, marked by higher contributions of aromatics and N/S‐containing compounds. Spatial analysis highlights industrial VCP emissions dispersed across suburban regions, whereas domestic VCP emissions are concentrated in urban cores. Key species like m/p‐xylene and methanol align with industrial emissions, whereas ethanol and D5‐siloxane match domestic emission patterns, indicative of promising application as industrial and domestic VCP tracers, respectively.

Due to substantial computational demands, however, adjoint simulations are constrained to coarse resolutions. This introduces potential biases in health risk assessments that are resolution‐sensitive. Here, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of resolution impacts on health‐focused adjoint assessments of ambient fine particulate matter pollution by analyzing variations in the GEOS‐Chem Adjoint model results across different resolutions and spatial scales. We observed that enhancing the model resolution from 4° × 5° to 2° × 2.5° increased the adjoint‐based estimates of global ambient PM2.5‐related premature deaths by 8.0%, with nearly half of the countries and grid cells showing discrepancies exceeding 20% and 30%, respectively. Further resolution refinement in eastern China to 0.25° × 0.3125°, based on nested simulations, revealed an additional 7.1% increase in estimated mortality. These resolution‐induced disparities predominantly arise from a more pronounced spatial covariation between emissions and forcing (i.e., the partial derivative of the cost function with respect to concentration) at finer resolutions. To mitigate this limitation, we developed a process‐based hybrid approach that dynamically models the inverse transport and convection processes at fine resolutions while simulating chemical and removal processes at coarse resolutions. Compared with direct interpolation methods, this hybrid approach reduces the root mean squared error by more than 40%, accurately reproducing finely resolved adjoint sensitivities and offering a promising avenue for enhancing both forward and adjoint global health assessments at higher spatial resolutions."

The Suomi National Polar‐orbiting Partnership satellite equipped with a low‐light imager enables mesopause TGW observations over distant regions, complementing the limited ground‐based observations. However, a single polar satellite passes over once every night which fails to conduct continuous observations of the same gravity waves event. The launches of JPSS‐1 and JPSS‐2 permit multi‐satellite observations with enhanced temporal resolution. Our novel approach revealed a previously unreported stripes intersection in TGWs, which seems to contradict physical laws. This phenomenon is caused by location errors associated with the mesospheric altitude. Therefore, a parallax correction model is firstly performed for the precise location of mesopause gravity waves. Taking TC Bolaven (2023) and TC Krathon (2024) as examples, after correction, the wavelengths were similar, the central positions were almost overlapping and the stripes distribution conformed to the propagation characteristic. These validate the model effectiveness. Furthermore, to our knowledge, we report the first horizontal phase velocities for mesopause TGWs in distant ocean regions based on the multi‐satellite joint observation. With the launch of subsequent satellites, multi‐satellite joint observation will provide new opportunities for mesopause gravity wave propagation process."

Evidence From CMIP6 HighResMIP Simulations,"Tropical cyclone (TC) activity over the western North Pacific (WNP) exhibits substantial interannual variability, often attributed to sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies across the global oceans. However, the extent to which this variability can be driven by SST forcing remains unclear. Here we examine WNP TC activity simulated by five high‐resolution atmospheric models from the High Resolution Model Intercomparison Project, all of which are forced by observed SSTs. These SST‐forced simulations collectively reproduce key climatological characteristics of WNP TC activity, including their spatial distribution and seasonal evolution. On interannual timescales, the multi‐model mean captures variations in TC genesis frequency, track frequency, and power dissipation index over 1980–2014, with statistically significant correlation coefficients of 0.51, 0.62, and 0.65, respectively—indicating that SST forcing can account for approximately 30%–40% of the observed variability. This SST‐driven variability is closely linked to realistic simulations of large‐scale environmental conditions, as quantified by the dynamic genesis potential index, which largely controls both the spatial distribution and temporal variability of TC genesis. Further analysis reveals that trans‐basin SST anomalies—particularly those associated with the Pacific Meridional Mode, the Indian Ocean, and the North Atlantic—play a dominant role in modulating these large‐scale environments. Nonetheless, over half of the interannual variance in TC activity cannot be forced by SST, highlighting the limits of SST‐based seasonal prediction. These results underscore the importance of SST forcing while also pointing to the need for improved understanding of additional drivers of WNP TC variability."

 Accurate detection and quantification of methane point sources are critical for climate change mitigation. Recent advances in spaceborne hyperspectral imaging spectrometers offer new opportunities for global monitoring, yet systematic evaluation across missions remains limited. Here, we assess the spectral and radiometric performance of six operational hyperspectral satellites for methane plume detection. Results show that EMIT, EnMAP, and the GF5 series provide superior capabilities. EMIT achieved the best retrieval precision (σ = 18 ppb), followed by GF5–02-AHSI (σ = 31 ppb), EnMAP (σ = 33 ppb), and GF5-01 A-AHSI (σ = 47 ppb), outperforming PRISMA (σ = 84 ppb) and ZY1-02E-AHSI (σ = 71 ppb). These differences arise from finer spectral sampling distances (SSD: 7.4–8.4 nm), higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNR: 170–250), and more stable central wavelength shifts (0.3–1.3 nm) within the 2300 nm methane absorption region, which collectively enhance plume discrimination against surface backgrounds. In contrast, PRISMA and ZY1-02E-AHSI exhibit lower sensitivity due to larger wavelength shifts (up to 2.8 nm) and lower SNRs (140–150). Case studies illustrate successful detection of methane plumes from diverse sources, including oil and gas (O&G) infrastructure, coal mines, and a landfill site, highlighting both straightforward and challenging retrieval scenarios. This cross-sensor comparison underscores the importance of spectral fidelity and radiometric performance for methane monitoring. The findings provide a quantitative basis for prioritizing existing assets and guiding the design of future missions, emphasizing that high SNR and stable spectral calibration are key for advancing global detection of point-source methane emissions."

 Identifying air pollutant sources and quantifying related emissions provides crucial information towards improving global air quality and public health. However, emission inventories for oil and gas (OG) activities inadequately represent nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions—a key precursor to tropospheric ozone and secondary aerosols—with notable discrepancies identified. Satellite remote sensing provides a unique vantage point to map and quantify these emissions consistently on a global scale. Here, we quantify annual NOx emissions from 44 major OG basins distributed globally, utilizing TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) nitrogen dioxide (NO2) observations with the divergence flux method. In addition, we use the spaceborne Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) natural gas flaring detections to further constrain satellite-derived NOx emissions. The divergence flux method, which addresses 3D topography corrections and chemical loss of NOx while accounting for wind-induced flux smearing, provides a robust approach for estimating NOx emissions. This top-down approach resolves emissions at the facility and basin scale (0.01° x 0.01°), enabling direct quantification of a major gap in current bottom-up inventories. Our findings reveal significant differences between satellite observations and established inventories, which systematically underestimate OG sector emissions. A direct comparison of our TROPOMI-derived NOx emissions against the existing inventories suggests that EDGARv6.1 underestimates onshore emissions by 61 % and offshore emissions by 26 %. The discrepancy is even more pronounced for the CAMS-GLOB-ANT_v5.3 inventory, which underestimates onshore and offshore emissions by 78 % and 92 %, respectively. These findings hold significance for global emission assessments, demonstrating that current inventories are missing a substantial source of NOx pollution, particularly from OG fields. Furthermore, our approach provides detailed spatial emission maps that enhance the granularity in depicting NOx distribution with error analysis (uncertainties: 32 %-54 %) supporting that inventory discrepancies are statistically significant, representing structural deficiencies rather than measurement error. We further explore the variations in the correlation between NOx emissions with OG production volumes and CH4 concentrations across different OG basins in North America. The observed co-locations and correlations provide important insights into co-pollution emission characteristics of methane and NOx, that are respectively a potent greenhouse gas and a reactive air quality pollutant, linked to be originating from oil and gas activity. These findings have important implications for regulatory monitoring and verification, particularly for addressing emissions transparency requirements under international climate frameworks."

 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are semi-volatile organic pollutants of global concern due to their ubiquity, persistence, potential carcinogenicity, and complex intermedia exchange behaviors. This study investigates the occurrence, composition, and transport mechanisms of PAHs across air, soil, and plants on university campuses with high densities of young adults (aged 18–30). Annual mean concentrations of gaseous ∑16 PAHs (total of 16 USEPA priority PAHs) were 40 ± 14 ng/m3, with 2–3 ring PAHs comprising 59.6 % of the total. Soils accumulated up to 1000 ± 710 ng/g, dominated by 4 ring (37.8 %) and 5–6 ring PAHs (36.5 %). Leaf concentrations averaged 290 ± 160 ng/g, with species-specific accumulation varying up to 5-fold, influenced by wax content (34 ± 28 g/m2), specific leaf area (210 ± 80 cm2/g), and stomatal density (69 ± 38 stomata/mm2). According to McLachlan's framework for semi-volatile organic compounds (SOCs) in plants, dynamic equilibrium between the gaseous phase and plants dominated uptake in spring, autumn, and winter, while atmospheric gaseous deposition was predominant in summer. Mackay's fugacity model indicated that 3-ring PAHs (e.g., acenaphthylene, acenaphthene) showed net volatilization (ff > 0.5), with annual mean fluxes of 368 ng/m2/day (main campus) and 173 ng/m2/day (new campus), whereas 4–6 ring PAHs tended to deposit (ff < 0.5). These findings highlight the importance of considering spatial heterogeneity, species-specific plant traits, and seasonal dynamics when assessing the fate and exposure risks of PAHs in urban green spaces, particularly within densely populated university campuses."

 Monocotyledonous plants (monocots) are gaining recognition as a major source of biogenic isoprene, but are massively understudied and underrepresented in current isoprene emission inventories. In addition, very scarce leaf observational studies have been conducted to evaluate their emission flux response to environmental variables to date, representing a major gap in current models. Here, we screened isoprene emissions flux from ten monocots growing on the Ryukyu Island, Okinawa, Japan. We further evaluated their leaf-level emission flux response under varying photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and temperature and applied the “Ping-Pong” method to iteratively optimize temperature (CT) and light (CL) parameters of the G93 algorithm. The ten monocots studied were Arenga engleri, Dypsis lutescens, Livistona chinensis, Mascarena verschaffeltii, Phoenix roebelenii, Satakentia liukiuensis, Pandanus boninensis, Arundo donax, Ravenala madagascariensis, and Dracaena fragrans. Eight were found to emit isoprene, and among these, six are being reported for the first time. Plants were treated with increasing PPFD and temperature to a maximum value (ascending phase), followed by a stepwise decrease (descending phase). Their emission response to this treatment resembled a characteristic pattern observed in plants that experienced prolonged hot weather, which is poorly captured by both the default and optimized G93 algorithms. To improve model performance, we applied the separate optimization approach, where the ascending and descending phases were optimized separately. In all species, the optimized CT parameter (CT1) and CL parameter (α) of the ascending phase were higher than that of the default G93 or that of the descending phase. Basal emission rate (BER) at standard conditions (30 °C and 1000 μmol m−2 s−1 PPFD) of A. donax was the highest emitter among the monocots. The BERs of monocots reported here were lower than those of dicots under comparative hot weather conditions. These results add to isoprene emission inventories for monocot species, as well as expand our knowledge of variability in monocot isoprene emission flux response to environmental variables."

 Brown carbon (BrC) is an important constituent of atmospheric carbonaceous aerosols, and accurately measuring its mass concentration and optical property is of great importance to reduce its uncertainties in model parametrization. This study deployed the novel Bayesian inference (BI) model to determine the BrC mass concentration and absorption on an hour-by-hour basis, using online measurements of multi-wavelength light absorption and total carbon (TC) data over June and December 2023 in Wuhan, central China. BrC mass contributed to 42 % of the TC aerosol and showed comparable level in two months, while its absorption showed distinct seasonal contrast with much higher values in December. Important BrC compositions including various organic tracers were measured, taking advantage of the concurrently collected daily 12-h offline filter samples. BrC mass and absorption showed good correlations with important components such as oxygenated-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), light PAHs and biomass burning tracer-saccharides. Organic-tracer based source apportionment was conducted for both BrC mass and absorption, and nine distinct source factors were resolved. Secondary sources especially secondary organic aerosol (SOA) factor dominated BrC mass contributions in June, while biomass burning emerged as the primary source in December. The primary sources contributing to BrC absorption were SOA and biomass burning in June, while biomass burning dominated in December. Coal combustion, which was a minor source to BrC mass, was a non-negligible contributor to BrC absorption in both months. Different control measures should be implemented to effectively control BrC mass for improved air quality and to mitigate BrC absorption for its climate effect. The results from this study broaden our understandings of the relationship among chemical, optical and sources of BrC, offering significant implications for environmental management."

 Convective-scale wind analysis and short-range forecast remains challenging due to the limited availability of high-temporal-resolution surface wind observations. This study investigates the impact of assimilating conventional 10-min average wind (CAW) and maximum 2-min average wind (MAW) observations from automatic weather stations on convective-scale wind analysis and short-term forecasting, focusing on a severe squall line event that affected Beijing on 30 May 2024. A series of sensitivity experiments were conducted using the WRF-3DVar system, including both single observation tests and full-domain assimilation experiments. Results indicate that CAW data, owing to their high temporal frequency, contribute to localized improvements in near-surface wind analysis and enhance the depiction of cold pool intensity. In contrast, MAW data exert broader, more profound influence that extends through multiple vertical layers, enabling a markedly more accurate reconstruction of three-dimensional wind and the full spatial footprint of the cold pool in the convective system. The comparative analysis demonstrates that MAW assimilation generates larger wind increments, broader spatial coverage, and better agreement with mesoscale observations than CAW assimilation. Additionally, MAW data yield a more realistic temporal evolution of surface winds and more coherent representation of gust front dynamics. These findings underscore the superior capability of MAW observations in convective-scale wind assimilation. Their expansive spatial reach and robust dynamical coherence offer greater potential for improving short-term convective forecasts, positioning them as an indispensable resource for the next generation of nowcasting and data-assimilation frameworks."

However, the indirect N2O emission factor (EF) model, applied by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for estimating inland water N2O emissions, is inadequate for lakes due to uncertainties in the N2O production pathways and significant spatiotemporal variations in EF values. Herein, we combined in situ N2O emission investigations, metagenomic sequencing, and isotopic mapping techniques to determine the pathway of N2O production and environmental control of EF values in shallow eutrophic lakes along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Dissolved N2O concentration exhibited a significant correlation with nitrate (NO3−-N), coupled with a positive relationship between the (nirK+ nirS)/nosZ ratio and N2O fluxes. Furthermore, a δ15NSP-δ18ON2O mapping approach model verified that 94.0 ± 9.1% of the total N2O production was contributed by denitrification. These observations jointly demonstrated that denitrification dominated the N2O production in the studied lacustrine system. Based on these findings, the nitrogen source (NO3−-N) concentration for denitrification and the ratio of the carbon source (dissolved organic carbon (DOC)) to NO3−-N concentration (DOC/NO3−-N) were incorporated into a model, both of which showed high correlations with EF values in the studied lacustrine system and global meta-analysis dataset. This model, which provides a good fit, corrects N2O emission overestimations from IPCC models by using easily obtained water quality variables."

This study examines typhoon and non-typhoon heavy precipitation over SEA during 1960–2024 using a typhoon track dataset and three high-resolution precipitation products. Results show a significant decrease in typhoon-precipitation contribution to total precipitation across the entire SEA, both in its continental and maritime regions, especially during the boreal summer half-year. This trend persists under heavy precipitation conditions (95th and 99th percentiles). In contrast, based on tracking results, non-typhoon heavy precipitation shows increases in precipitation area but decreases in lifespan intensity, yielding more total precipitation per event. Our findings indicate a shifting hazard regime: a decrease in typhoon-related rainfall is being offset by a spatial expansion of non-typhoon heavy precipitation, introducing a new regional risk. The findings provide critical insights into the change of regional precipitation patterns and have implications for disaster management and adaptation in SEA."

Chipperfield,The impact of the stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation on Arctic polar stratospheric cloud occurrence,"We find that wind variations at the equator (QBO) modulate the occurrence of Arctic polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs), which are key contributors to ozone depletion. During westerly QBO, the PSC occurrence is significantly greater than during easterly QBO. The QBO affects PSC mainly through temperature, while H2O and HNO3 have less effect. This suggests that future climate change may affect ozone recovery if it alters the QBO pattern. This study provides a new perspective on ozone prediction. 
 Polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) play a critical role in stratospheric ozone depletion. Previous studies have shown that the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) influences the Arctic stratospheric polar vortex and ozone, yet few studies have thoroughly analyzed the impact of the QBO on Arctic PSC occurrence. This study examines this impact using CALIPSO observations from 2006 to 2021 and SLIMCAT simulations from 1979 to 2022. The results show that the winter PSC coverage area is significantly larger during the westerly QBO (WQBO) phase than during the easterly QBO (EQBO) phase, with a zonal asymmetry in PSC occurrence frequency anomalies. The QBO influences the temperature, water vapour (H2O), and nitric acid (HNO3) in the Arctic stratosphere, which are key factors affecting PSC formation. During the WQBO phase, Arctic stratospheric temperatures show negative anomalies, with the centre of this anomaly biased towards North America. In addition, H2O shows positive anomalies in the Arctic lower stratosphere, mainly due to the stronger polar vortex preventing the transport of high-moisture air at high latitudes to mid-latitudes, causing H2O to accumulate inside the polar vortex. HNO3 shows negative anomalies, primarily caused by denitrification through nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) sedimentation. Sensitivity analyses further indicate that QBO-induced temperature anomalies are the dominant driver of PSC variability, while the direct effect of H2O anomalies on PSCs is relatively small. The reduction of HNO3 mainly affects PSCs in February and March. This work implies that future changes in the QBO may influence ozone by affecting PSCs."

By applying an advanced inversion system, we produced improved NMVOC emission inventories in 2019 and 2020. The optimized results improve formaldehyde and ozone simulations in general, and a consistency analysis is further designed to assess the reliability of these two posteriors. 
 Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) are key precursors of ozone and secondary organic aerosols. As one of the world’s largest NMVOC emitters, accurate emission inventories are essential for understanding and mitigating air pollution in China. Commonly-used inventories (e.g., MEIC) are largely based on bottom-up methods, which often fail to capture the spatiotemporal variability of NMVOC emissions, resulting in significant model-observation mismatches. This study evaluates the shape factor, filtered data volume, and monthly mean biases of OMI, OMPS, and TROPOMI formaldehyde products, with the latest OMPS and TROPOMI retrievals offering substantially higher effective spatiotemporal coverage. Monthly NMVOC emissions over China in 2020 are then optimized by independently assimilating formaldehyde retrievals either from OMPS or from TROPOMI, using a self-developed 4DEnVar assimilation emission inversion system. The OMPS- and TROPOMI-driven assimilation yields consistent seasonal and regional increments in NMVOC emissions in general, but distinctions are also notable. A consistency analysis is introduced to assess the reliability of these two posterior emissions. Highly consistent increments are obtained in the North China Plain (May–June), the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta (January–March, October–December), and the Sichuan Basin (January, June–December). These adjustments significantly improve surface ozone simulations, with 81.25 % of consistent cases demonstrating reduced biases and an average RMSE reduction of 24.7 %. These findings highlight the effectiveness of OMPS and TROPOMI formaldehyde assimilation, coupled with consistency analysis, in refining NMVOC emission estimates and enhancing ozone simulation accuracy. Similar promising results are achieved in the OMPS/TROPOMI-based NMVOC emission inversion in 2019."

We find that hygroscopicity depends on particle size, source-related changes, and moisture-driven processing, which distinguishes this region from other high-altitude regions and may provide key constraints for aerosol-cloud and regional climate models. 
 Understanding the hygroscopicity and mixing state of atmospheric aerosol particles is crucial for accurately assessing their role in cloud formation and subsequent climate impacts. However, measurements in the lower free troposphere – a representative atmospheric layer characterizing regional background conditions in aerosol transport and atmospheric evolution – remain sparse, especially in regions influenced by both anthropogenic emissions and long-range transported air masses. This study adds further data on size-resolved hygroscopicity and mixing state measurements of aerosols at Mt. Hua (2060 m a.s.l., central China) during October–November 2021 using a Hygroscopicity Tandem Differential Mobility Analyzer (HTDMA). Results reveal a clear size-dependence of aerosol hygroscopicity, with the mean hygroscopicity parameter (κmean) increased from 0.20 for 30 nm particles to 0.30 for 200 nm particles. The ambient submicron aerosols were primarily externally mixed, dominated by more-hygroscopic (MH) particles, with no significant diurnal variation, indicating minimal influence from boundary layer dynamics. Starting from 6 November, the combined influence of mineral dust and regional heating activities led to a notable reduction in aerosol hygroscopicity, especially in larger particles. This decline was driven by an increase in weakly hygroscopic components such as mineral dust, black carbon, and organic compounds, highlighting the impact of both long-range transport and regional emissions on aerosol composition. Notably, during episodes of striking high relative humidity (RH > 80 %) in Cluster 5, atmospheric aerosols containing mineral dust showed unexpected hygroscopic enhancement, suggesting in situ RH-driven chemical processing that increased aerosol hygroscopicity. Atmospheric aerosols at Mt. Hua displayed distinct hygroscopic properties compared to other high-altitude sites, underscoring regional differences in aerosol sources and free tropospheric processing. These findings advance our understanding of aerosol aging and processes in the lower free troposphere over central China, and offer crucial observational constraints for modeling aerosol–cloud interaction and regional climate impacts."

Results show that under comparable thermodynamic conditions, dust-laden precipitation systems have higher storm tops, broader upper-level precipitation areas with more large particles, stronger convective activities, and heavier surface rain rates than clean ones. 
 Saharan dust aerosols interacting with clouds and precipitation in the Atlantic Ocean's intertropical convergence zone can significantly impact storm microphysical and thermodynamic processes. Previous satellite research often focused on individual, km-scale rain pixels, neglecting interconnections among different locations. This study innovatively employs a clustering method to group satellite precipitation radar-observed profiles into organized precipitation systems (PSs) of varying horizontal sizes. Key features such as the mean storm top height, 85 GHz polarization-corrected microwave brightness temperature, and horizontal area with specific radar reflectivity per layer are analyzed to uncover system-level precipitation characteristics. Observations indicate that dust-laden PSs have higher storm tops, broader upper-level precipitation areas with more large particles, stronger ice scattering signals, and heavier surface rain rates than clean systems. These PSs also exhibit greater convective available potential energy (CAPE) and distinct differences in related dynamic and moisture conditions. Partial correlation and sensitivity analyses revealed that CAPE-induced changes are the primary confounding factor for dust aerosol effects. Notably, even after constraining CAPE and other thermodynamic factors, significant dust-induced changes in PS properties persist. This implies that, under comparable thermodynamic conditions, Saharan dust aerosols may enhance mid- and upper-level ice heterogeneous nucleation, thereby increasing the number of ice particles, releasing extra latent heat, and invigorating storms. Overall, this study offers a novel perspective on how dust aerosols affect organized precipitation systems."

In the subtropics, the shape of the Nd-LWP relationship switches from an inverted-V at 1° grid-resolution to an “M” shape at 0.1° resolution with decreased dlnLWPdlnNd sensitivity. Tropical and midlatitude regions generally show a more positive sensitivity. Cloud sampling and filtering also influence this slope, wherein the exclusion of thin clouds, as commonly performed to reduce retrieval uncertainty, leads to strongly negative sensitivity across all regions. Precipitation is primarily responsible for driving the strength of the sensitivity, with strong positive slopes in raining clouds and negative and/or neutral responses found in non-raining clouds. A new method to compute radiative forcing from the ML model shows a robust Twomey radiative forcing across all regions and grid resolutions. However, LWP and cloud fraction adjustments to the radiative forcing, which are ∼50 % or smaller than the Twomey effect, decrease to negligible values with higher spatial resolution data. As Earth system models move toward higher spatial resolutions in the future, evaluating the LWP and CF adjustment contributions to the radiative forcing budget at these finer resolutions will be essential for evaluation and model development."

These particles create more ice crystals, which leads to a net warming effect on the climate in polar regions. Understanding this process is crucial for making accurate climate predictions as global wildfire activity increases. 
 Atmospheric aerosols can serve as ice-nucleating particles (INPs), influencing cirrus cloud formation and properties. While mineral dust is recognized as an effective INP, the role of soot remains less explored, limiting climate impact assessments. Here we use cloud parcel model simulations to examine the competitive ice nucleation behavior of soot and dust, alongside homogeneous nucleation. These process-level simulations reveal that dust dominates heterogeneous ice nucleation at colder temperatures (T<210 K), whereas soot becomes increasingly more important at warmer temperatures, particularly when dust concentrations are low.  To evaluate their global-scale implications, we integrate these results into the GFDL AM4-MG2 climate model. We find that dust shapes the baseline spatial and seasonal ice crystal number concentration (ICNC) patterns, while soot (represented in the model as black carbon, BC) enhances global-mean ICNC by ∼ 5 %. However, BC-driven increases in ICNC can be much larger in the upper troposphere (500–250 hPa), reaching up to 90 %. The strongest enhancements are found during boreal spring across Eurasia and the Maritime Continent, and during austral spring over South America and the South Atlantic. Radiatively, BC INPs can enhance the annual global longwave cloud radiative effect by approximately 0.24 W m−2 and cause statistically significant net warming in both polar regions during their respective winters. These results highlight the coupled roles of dust and soot in cloud ice formation, underscoring the need to assess the impacts of rising wildfire emissions on atmospheric ice processes and associated climate effects."

Here we measured the dust size distribution from fine to giant particles at an emission source during a field campaign in Jordan (J-WADI) using multiple instruments. Our findings show that large particles make up a significant part of the total dust mass. This knowledge is essential to improve climate models and to predict dust impacts on climate and environment. 
 Mineral dust particles emitted from dry, uncovered soil can be transported over vast distances, thereby influencing climate and environment. Its impacts are highly size-dependent, yet large particles with diameters dp>10 µm remain understudied due to their low number concentrations and instrumental limitations. Accurately characterizing the particle size distribution (PSD) at emission is crucial for understanding dust transport and climate interactions.Here we characterize the dust PSD at an emission source during the Jordan Wind Erosion and Dust Investigation (J-WADI) campaign, conducted in Wadi Rum, Jordan, in September 2022, focusing on super-coarse (10<dp≤62.5 µm) and giant (dp>62.5 µm) particles. This study is the first to continuously cover the full range of diameters from dp=0.4 to 200 µm at an emission source by using a suite of aerosol spectrometers with overlapping size ranges. This overlap enabled a systematic intercomparison and validation across instruments, improving PSD reliability.Results show significant PSD variability over the course of the campaign. During periods with friction velocities (u*) above 0.22 m s−1 (or ∼ 3.3 m s−1 threshold 4 m wind speed), the approximate threshold for local dust emission by saltation, both dust concentrations and the contributions of super-coarse and giant particles typically increased with increasing u*, especially under neutral to unstable atmospheric stability conditions. These large particles accounted for about 90 % of the total mass concentration during the campaign. A prominent mass concentration peak was observed near dp=60 µm in geometric diameter. While particle concentrations for dp<10 µm showed good agreement among most instruments, discrepancies appeared for larger dp due to reduced instrument sensitivity at the size range boundaries and sampling inefficiencies. Despite these challenges, physical samples collected using a flat-plate sampler largely confirmed the PSDs derived from the aerosol spectrometers. These findings help to advance our understanding of the dust PSD and the abundance of super-coarse and giant particle at emission sources."

Collocated with reference instruments over 19 months in Nicosia, results showed that CO and PM (particulate matter) sensors captured daily, hourly, and monthly spatial trends. NO2, NO, and O3 sensors were less reliable due to environmental effects. Still, all sensors tracked monthly temporal variations at the same location, with PM2.5 showing the strongest agreement with reference data. 
 Low-cost gas and particle sensors can enhance the spatial coverage of Air Quality (AQ) monitoring networks in urban settings. While their accuracy is insufficient to replace reference instruments, they may still capture spatial differences among different stations, as well as temporal trends and month-to-month variabilities at a specific location. To assess this, we conducted a 19-month study using two Vaisala AQ Transmitters-Monitors (Model AQT530), collocated with reference-grade instruments, at two AQ stations in Nicosia: an urban traffic and an urban background station. These two stations are ideal for the needs of this study considering that the reference measurements carried out there exhibit statistically significant spatial and temporal differences in pollutant concentrations when analysed over the entire period and on a monthly basis.The AQT530 air quality monitor employs Low-Cost Sensors (LCSs) for gaseous pollutants (i.e., CO, NO2, NO and O3) and particulate matter (PM). Tests of the performance of the two AQT530 monitors during an initial period when those were collocated at the urban traffic station revealed high unit-to-unit agreements for the CO, NO and PM10, and good to moderate for the NO2, O3 and PM2.5 measurements. The CO and PM10 LCS measurements also effectively captured concentration differences between the two stations when averaged over the entire study period or monthly, with some exceptions for specific months. These LCSs successfully detected spatial concentration differences (i.e., monthly, daily and hourly) as long as those were above a certain threshold. Overall, the CO and PM sensors successfully tracked month-to-month trends over the entire study period, similarly to reference instruments, whereas NO2, NO, and O3 sensors struggled due to environmental sensitivities. Despite this, all sensors identified statistically significant month-to-month variations at the same station, with the PM2.5 measurements showing the strongest agreement with reference data."

Compounds from various chemical functionalities (alcohols, acids, aldehydes), from biogenic and anthropogenic origin, were identified. Improved method performance was observed for nitro compounds, which have been associated with anthropogenic activities. 
 In this study, we present two optimized analytical methods for the quantification of molecular markers to attribute the contribution of various Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) oxidation products to Secondary Organic Aerosol (SOA). Those involve Ultrahigh Performance Liquid Chromatography Electrospray Ionization coupled to Ion Mobility Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (UPLC/ESI-IMS-QTOFMS) and Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Liquid extraction was performed for both techniques, with an extra derivatization step with N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) containing 1 % trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) for GC-MS analysis, enhancing the compound detection capacity. Between the two techniques, 23 biogenic and anthropogenic markers were identified, with five common species detected. Recoveries between 40 % and 170 % were observed for nitro-containing compounds and between 70 % and 140 % for aromatic and non-aromatic acids except for 3-methyl-1,2,3-butanetricarboxylic acid. Limits of detection <5 ng were observed by UPLC/ESI-IMS-QTOFMS analysis for 4-nitrophenol and 2-methyl-4-nitrophenol, while GC-MS (with BSTFA derivatization) analysis allowed better detection of lower mass compounds (for example limit of detection for 2-methylerythritol was 0.10 ng). While UPLC/ESI-IMS-QTOFMS allows for the analysis of high molecular weight compounds at high resolution and sensitivity, GC-MS analysis focuses on compounds of lower mass and higher polarity, together, these complementary methods provide a comprehensive tool for the quantification of organic markers arising from the airborne transformation of compounds of both biogenic and anthropogenic origins."

Nielsen;Klaus S. Larsen;Poul Erik Lærke;Andres F. Rodriguez;Johannes W. M. Pullens;Rasmus J. Petersen;Jesper R. Christiansen,"A full year of continuous net soil and ditch CO2, CH4, N2O fluxes, soil hydrology and meteorology for a drained fen in Denmark","Quantifying greenhouse gas emissions from wetlands is vital for climate mitigation. Our high-precision measurements of CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes reveal highly dynamic exchanges, especially for CO2 and N2O, driven by temperature and groundwater fluctuations across hourly to monthly scales. These insights advance understanding of wetland emission regulation and support improved biogeochemical models. 
 We present a detailed dataset (https://doi.org/10.60612/DATADK/BZQ8JE, Skov Nielsen et al., 2025) of automated greenhouse gas (GHG) net soil and ditch fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) from a drained fen in Denmark covering a full year. The dataset resolves small scale spatial and hourly-daily-seasonal dynamics of GHG soil fluxes. The GHG flux dataset is accompanied by simultaneous time series of soil temperature and moisture, as well as groundwater table depth and covers spatiotemporal gradients in soil hydrological and climatic variability. The GHG fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O were measured simultaneously by a high-precision cavity ring down laser spectrometer connected with a novel automated GHG system platform called SkyLine2D (Earthbound Scientific Ltd., UK) that allowed up to 27 individual chamber measurement points along a 24 m transect. In total 47.483 chamber measurements were completed and after quality control 44.631 CO2 fluxes, 44.099 N2O and 42.515 CH4 fluxes remained.The average (±SE) net soil CO2 efflux observed at the site (2.6 ± 0.02 µmol CO2 m−2 s−1 or 35 ± 0.3 tCO2 ha−1 yr−1) aligns with findings from similar drained fens in northern Europe covering substantial spatial variability. The organic soil at the site was a larger net source of N2O (8.9 ± 0.1 nmol N2O m−2 s−1 or 123 ± 1.4 kg N2O ha−1 yr−1) to the atmosphere compared to other temperate drained organic grassland soils in northern Europe with similar spatial variability as soil CO2 effluxes. However, the temporal variability of N2O fluxes were closely linked to fluctuations of the groundwater table depth with emission bursts of soil N2O emissions during low water table depth. N2O fluxes decreased to near-zero fluxes when the water table depth increased. Net soil CH4 fluxes were near-zero and the site overall acted as a smaller net source (0.18 ± 0.06 nmol CH4 m−2 s−1 or 0.91 ± 0.3 kg CH4 ha−1 yr−1) compared to other drained organic grassland soils, although net uptake of atmospheric CH4 was observed as well especially in drier conditions. Compared to the peat soil, the ditch was a smaller net source of CO2 (0.94 ± 0.05 µmol CO2 m−2 s−1 or 1.3 ± 0.7 tCO2 ha−1 yr−1) and N2O (0.35 ± 0.03 nmol N2O m−2 s−1 or 4.9 ± 0.4 kg N2O ha−1 yr−1). The ditch emission of CH4 (161 ± 13 nmol CH4 m−2 s−1 or 812 ± 66 kg CH4 ha−1 yr−1) average of diffusive and ebullition fluxes) to the atmosphere was more than two orders of magnitude larger than the net soil CH4 emissions.The very large number of fluxes of CO2, N2O and CH4 for peat soils and a ditch linked to both groundwater table data, soil moisture/temperature as well as groundwater and soil physicochemical parameters are unique to northern temperate peatlands and holds a potential for exploring and testing basic hypothesis on the simultaneous regulation of these gas fluxes by both soil hydrology and temperature, including soil and groundwater chemistry. The high temporal detail also allows for time series analyses as well as investigations into diurnal and seasonal patterns of fluxes in response to physical drivers. Similarly, the high frequency of measured variables and the large number of spatial replicates are furthermore well suited for testing biogeochemical models as it is possible to have both calibration and validation dataset covering the same period. Furthermore, the surprisingly large spatial variability of flux data is ideal to include in model sensitivity tests which can aid in constraining model outputs and develop model routines."

We developed a 1995–2024 dataset that enhances satellite-based plant activity measurements by resolving data inconsistencies and improving resolution. Using advanced modeling, we harmonized signals from multiple satellites, cutting errors by 49 %. This offers clearer global photosynthesis trends, aiding climate research and vegetation monitoring. 
 Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a crucial proxy of photosynthetic processes in vegetation. In recent decades, advancements in remote sensing technology have facilitated long-term global SIF monitoring, significantly enhancing our understanding of vegetation dynamics on a global scale. Despite this progress, current SIF datasets face major challenges, including temporal inconsistencies among various satellite-derived products and a lack of long-term, high-resolution observations. In this study, we developed a “Long-term Harmonized SIF” (LHSIF) dataset spanning 1995 to 2024 with a fine spatial resolution of 0.05° by coordinating SIF satellite observations from GOME, SCIAMACHY, GOME-2, and OCO-2. Light use efficiency (LUE)-based spatial downscaling models were employed for each SIF product to generate fine-resolution global SIF maps. The long-term dataset was constructed using temporally corrected GOME-2A SIF (TCSIF) as a benchmark and was combined with a cumulative distribution function (CDF) normalization method for far-red SIF harmonization across satellite sensors from GOME, SCIAMACHY, and OCO-2. The resulting harmonized dataset shows a 49 % reduction in inter-sensor differences compared to the uncorrected data and exhibits a stable interannual increase of 0.31 ± 0.07 % yr−1. This result strongly aligns with the growth rate of gross primary production (GPP, 0.47 ± 0.03 % yr−1) and is consistent with ground-based SIF observations (R>0.60). Therefore, the long-term harmonized SIF dataset with a fine 0.05° resolution is valuable for estimating global photosynthesis over extended periods. The LHSIF dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16394372 (Zou et al., 2025)."

By combining traditional forecasting data with actual weather observations, the AI system achieved better temperature predictions at local scales. While showed promise for temperature forecasting, it still had difficulty accurately predicting extreme rainfall events. The research advances weather forecasting capabilities, potentially helping communities prepare for severe weather conditions. 
 Sub-seasonal weather forecasting is a major challenge, particularly when high spatial resolution is needed to capture complex patterns and extreme events. Traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models struggle with accurate forecasting at finer scales, especially for precipitation. In this study, we investigate the use of 3D U-Net architecture for post-processing sub-seasonal forecasts to enhance both predictability and spatial resolution, focusing on the western U.S. Using the ECMWF ensemble forecasting system (input) and high-resolution PRISM data (target), we tested different combinations of ensemble members and meteorological variables. Our results demonstrate that the 3D U-Net model significantly improves temperature predictability and consistently outperforms NWP models across multiple metrics. However, challenges remain in accurately forecasting extreme precipitation events, as the model tends to underestimate precipitation in coastal and mountainous regions. While ensemble members contribute to forecast accuracy, their impact is modest compared to the improvements achieved through downscaling. The model using the ensemble mean and only the target variables was most efficient. This model improved the pattern correlation coefficient for temperature and precipitation by 0.12 and 0.19, respectively, over a 32 d lead time. This study lays the groundwork for further development of neural network-based post-processing methods, showing their potential to enhance weather forecasts at sub-seasonal timescales."

Pierson;Sebastian Sobek,Integration of the Global Water and Lake Sectors within the ISIMIP framework through scaling of streamflow inputs to lakes,"Climate change affect lakes by including not just the lakes themselves but also the land areas that drain into them. These surrounding areas influence how much water and nutrients flow into lakes which in turn impact water quality. Here, water fluxes from land, derived from a global hydrological model where water fluxes are modelled at the grid scale, were used to estimate streamflow inputs to lakes from their catchments. Using data from 70 Swedish lakes, we showed that our method works well. 
 Climate change impacts both lakes and their surrounding catchments, leading to altered discharge and nutrient loading patterns from catchments to lakes, as well as modified thermal stratification and mixing dynamics within lakes. These alterations affect biogeochemical processes and water quality in lakes. Coupled catchment-lake modeling provides both a holistic evaluation of the effects of climate change on lakes and a framework for explicitly assessing the importance of how catchments effect lakes. The Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) provides a framework for projecting the impacts of climate change across multiple sectors (e.g. water, lakes, energy, health) of the Earth System consistently, enabling integrated cross-sectoral assessments. However, climate impacts on lake dynamics are modeled in ISIMIP without consideration of the links between lakes and the surrounding catchments. This is a significant limitation, as it restricts assessments to only the direct impacts of climate change on lakes, overlooking the critical interactions between lakes and their catchment areas. In this study, we establish the first dynamic connection between the Global Water and Lake Sectors in ISIMIP, achieved by scaling the gridded modeled outputs of water fluxes from the Global Water Sector to the catchments of the representative lakes of the Lake Sector. The streamflow to the representative lake of each grid cell, as defined by the ISIMIP Global Lake Sector, was calculated based on runoff proportional to the catchment area of each representative lake. If the lake surface area was larger than the grid cell area, water from upstream grid cells was included as the corresponding proportion of river discharge. The methodology was applied to 70 lakes across Sweden covering a wide range of sizes, hydrological settings and catchment characteristics. The estimated streamflow was validated against both the streamflow outputs from the hydrological model HYPE and observed data. The comparison demonstrated good agreement in terms of long-term streamflow mean and seasonal pattern, indicating that the proposed approach is capable of producing reliable streamflow estimates without requiring high-resolution local models. This estimated streamflow, representing water flow into lakes, will provide a valuable dataset for the scientific community within the ISIMIP Lake Sector supporting hydrological and water quality modeling efforts aimed at understanding the impacts of climate change on lakes."

We proposed a dynamic density approach where a positive density-precipitation relationship emerges. This method improves spatial pattern, significantly reduces mortality, sustains productivity, and raises the aridity threshold above which frequent mortality events occur in grasslands. 
 In semi-arid regions, grasses and shrubs often form spatially heterogeneous patterns interspersed with bare soil as a strategy to optimize resource use and maximise productivity. Accurately representing the matrix of vegetation and bare soil in global land surface models is essential for advancing the understanding of the carbon, water, and dust cycles. This study focuses on grasslands using the land surface model ORCHIDEE (ORganizing Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic EcosystEms), which originally assumes a globally fixed grassland density representing a fixed number of individuals per unit of land. This assumption, referred to as the fixed density approach, limits the model's ability to capture grassland responses to environmental changes, resulting in unsustainable productivity and unrealistically frequent mortality events, particularly in resource-limited regions. To address these limitations, we introduced a dynamic density approach that simulates grassland density based on indicators of vegetation growth, such as reserve and labile carbon content in the grass. The simulated grassland density was consistent with field-based estimates from five regional case studies and showed a better representation of bare soil in grasslands than the fixed density approach. The emerging positive correlation between precipitation and simulated grassland density supported the validity of the approach. Compared to the fixed density approach, the dynamic density approach substantially reduced simulated mortality events, raised the aridity threshold for frequent mortality, improved the simulated leaf area index (LAI) both globally and in key semi-arid regions, and maintained realistic grassland productivity in regions where the presence of grassland is confirmed by remotely sensed LAI. This study not only demonstrates that simulating grassland density as a function of carbon availability improves ORCHIDEE's capacity to capture grassland dynamics under environmental variability, but also provides a promising foundation for investigating dust dynamics and subsequent land–atmosphere feedbacks in (semi-)arid regions."

Here, by means of in situ ship-borne bubble-bursting SSA production experiments at multiple locations around the Antarctic Peninsula, we show a 2-fold variability in the 10–500 nm size-resolved SSA number concentrations. We observed that the organic chemical composition of seawater (SW) and surface microlayers (SML) clearly impacts SSA number concentrations. SW and SML samples with saccharides, proteins, and N-osmolytes were less efficient at emitting SSA compared with waters rich in biotic material originating from lipids, such as fatty acids and polyols. We found that the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fraction containing lipid degradation products and polyols indicates higher SSA production. Our results indicate that low concentration organic components, rather than the most abundant classes of biomolecules, influence the ability to be aerosolized, with strong chemical selectivity affecting SSA production."

In silico screening with T.E.S.T. and OPERA models across eight toxicological end points prioritized 117 substances with high predicted hazard potential. Of these, 46 were tested in zebrafish embryos encompassing diverse developmental end points, revealing that 24 (52.2%) induced significant toxicity at concentrations as low as 0.1 μM. These toxicants fell into six structural classes: fluorobenzenes, bromobenzenes, cyanobiphenyls, fluorenes, anthracenes, and bathocuproine, each displaying characteristic hazard profiles. Fluorobenzenes and cyanobiphenyls triggered broad developmental disruptions, whereas bromobenzenes primarily impaired pigmentation and behavior. Bathocuproine caused concentration-dependent lethality and severe multiorgan edema, while fluorenes and anthracenes heightened tactile responsiveness and reduced larval body length. Notably, 22 of these compounds have been detected in environmental matrices or human biomonitoring studies at levels approaching those causing toxicity in vivo, underscoring their environmental relevance.

In a panel study of 110 healthy Tibetan college students, we repeatedly measured week-long concentrations of seven selected carbonyls in participants’ dormitories and assessed biomarkers related to cardiovascular health. Carbonyl concentrations were generally higher indoors than outdoors, with the median indoor-to-outdoor ratio for decanal reaching 15. Further analyses suggest that the elevated indoor carbonyl concentrations likely result from ozone reactions, particularly with skin oil. Due to substantial ventilation variations across dormitories, indoor carbonyl concentrations showed no substantial correlations with outdoor ozone levels (r = −0.08∼0.20), enabling the evaluation of ozone-independent carbonyl health effects. Increased carbonyl exposure was significantly associated with the elevation of multiple red blood cell indices. Carbonyl associations with the red blood cell count, hemoglobin level, and hematocrit remained robust in ozone-adjusted models. These associations were further corroborated by additional analyses based on outdoor ozone levels and air-change rates. Increases in these red blood cell indices represent adverse cardiovascular effects in hypoxia-acclimated Tibetans and may contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic mountain sickness."

While deep learning excels at climate prediction, particularly for El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO), its interpretability remains limited to validating known correlations. Here we propose a paradigm integrating causal inference into data‐driven modeling to enable predictions based on genuine causal relationships. Following this paradigm, we develop ENSO‐CausalNet, achieving skillful ENSO prediction of the Niño 3.4 index up to 22 months ahead. Results reveal that dominant physical processes affecting ENSO vary with lead time, elucidating distinct causal pathways through which Bjerknes feedback and extratropical Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Ocean air‐sea interactions drive ENSO variability. When input dimensionality increases, the model may learn incomplete causal relationships, resulting in degraded prediction skill. These findings demonstrate that forecast capability depends critically on comprehensive causal understanding, confirming the model's physical validity. This paradigm provides robust ENSO predictions extensible to other climate systems, enabling mechanistic analysis and scientific discovery."

Here, using simulations from nine‐member ensemble under three future scenarios, we project that the expected annual probability of record‐shattering CDHW events (i.e., events exceeding historical severity records by more than two standard deviations) will double between 2015 and 2040 and continue to rise throughout the 21st century under the SSP5‐8.5 scenario (0.05% per year). The mean temperature, relative humidity, shortwave radiation, and precipitation are critical drivers of CDHW severity. Record‐shattering CDHW events severely impact ecosystems, particularly in regions such as southern North America, northern South America, and southern Europe. Observational data from 1951 to 2022 indicate that compared to nonrecord‐shattering CDHW events, record‐shattering CDHW events are correlated with weaker water vapor transport, reduced convective activity, and greater ecosystem damage, resulting in an additional global mean gross primary productivity (GPP) loss of −2.76 to −3.96 g C m−2 month−1. Between 2080 and 2099, the global average GPP anomalies caused by these events are projected to range from 46% to 119% of the warm season's monthly average ecosystem carbon sink.

Despite the known link, the multi–scale spatiotemporal variations in the burden of TB attributable to long‐term PM exposure remain largely unclear in China. In this study, we conducted a nationwide, multi‐scale risk assessment of the burden of TB attributable to long‐term PM2.5, PM2.5–10, and PM10 exposure from 2013 to 2019, employing the multivariate distributed lag nonlinear model (MVDLNM), Lorenz curve and Gini index. Our health impact assessments indicate that PM exposure has resulted in significant increases in TB burden. Specifically, approximately $1,202 million (95% CI: 801–1,573 million), $486 million (95% CI: 398–572 million), and $944 million (95% CI: 767–1,115 million) of health economic costs could be attributed to long‐term exposure to PM2.5, PM2.5–10, and PM10, respectively. Although the overall the burden of TB attributable to PM exposure was significantly reduced from 2013 to 2019, regional inequalities have become more pronounced. The Gini index reveals a clear disparity in the burden of TB related to PM exposure across provincial, city, and county levels. These disparities are most pronounced at the county level (0.4914–0.6801), followed by the city level (0.4135–0.6382), and are least evident at the province level (0.3672–0.6078). Overall, the regional inequalities in the burden of TB are more pronounced at finer spatial scales. Our study highlights the health impacts of long‐term exposure to PM on the incidence of TB across different spatiotemporal scales, and the findings provide strong scientific evidence for pollution mitigation and efforts to reduce regional inequality."

 Most baryons in present-day galaxy clusters exist as hot gas (≳107 K), forming the intracluster medium (ICM)1. Cosmological simulations predict that the mass and temperature of the ICM decline towards earlier times, as intracluster gas in younger clusters is still assembling and being heated2–4. To date, hot ICM has been securely detected only in a few systems at or above z ≈ 2, leaving the timing and mechanism of ICM assembly uncertain5–7. Here we report the direct observation of hot intracluster gas via its thermal Sunyaev–Zeldovich signature in the protocluster SPT2349–56 with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. SPT2349–56 hosts a large molecular gas reservoir and three radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) within an approximately 100-kpc region at z = 4.3 (refs. 8–11). The measurement implies a thermal energy of  about 1061 erg in the core, about 10 times more than gravity alone should produce. Contrary to current theoretical expectations3,4,12, the hot ICM in SPT2349–56 demonstrates that substantial heating can occur very early in cluster assembly, depositing enough energy to overheat the nascent ICM well before mature clusters become common at z ≈ 2.

 The response of net forest carbon uptake to warm extremes remains elusive. The year 2023 was at the time ‘the hottest year on record’ globally, with Canada’s forests experiencing warm anomalies of above 2 °C and unprecedented drought and wildfires, providing a unique case to examine the response of boreal forest net carbon uptake to climate extremes. Here we combine satellite-based atmospheric CO2 flux inversions with ground-based in situ observations of CO2 fluxes and concentrations to investigate Canada’s forest net carbon uptake and its underlying mechanisms in 2023. We find that, compared with 2015–2022, Canada’s forest net carbon uptake was enhanced by 0.28 ± 0.23 PgC, offsetting 38–48% of Canadian wildfire emissions in 2023. This enhanced net uptake was dominated by large ecosystem respiration reductions, mainly attributable to severe root-zone soil moisture deficits and the unimodal temperature response of respiration. However, most dynamic global vegetation models failed to simulate the respiration reductions and the responses to hydrothermal conditions well. This study improves our understanding of boreal forest net carbon uptake in response to climate extremes and highlights an urgent need to improve vegetation models under global warming. The extreme hot and dry conditions of 2023 reduced soil respiration and enhanced net forest carbon sequestration in Canada, offsetting wildfire emissions, according to satellite-based and in situ observations of CO2 fluxes."

 Projections of future sea-level rise benefit from understanding the response of past ice sheets to warming during past Quaternary interglacials. Constraints on the extent of inland Greenland Ice Sheet retreat during the Middle Holocene (~8–4 thousand years before present) are limited because geological records of a smaller-than-modern phase largely remain beneath the modern ice sheet. We drilled through 509 metres of firn and ice at Prudhoe Dome, northwestern Greenland, to obtain sub-ice material yielding direct evidence for the response of the northwest Greenland ice sheet to Holocene warmth. Here we present infrared stimulated luminescence measurements from sub-ice sediments that indicate that the ground below the summit was exposed to sunlight 7.1 ± 1.1 thousand years ago. This proposed complete deglaciation of Prudhoe Dome, coeval to reduced extent at other ice caps across northern Greenland, is consistent with interglacial-only δ18O values from the Prudhoe Dome ice column and ice depth–age modelling. Our results point to a substantial response of the northwest Greenland ice sheet to early Holocene warming, estimated to be +3–5 °C from palaeoclimate data. This range of summer temperatures is similar to projections of warming by 2100 CE.

 Wildfires affect land surface and post-fire geomorphological activity worldwide, increasing surface runoff and soil erosion. However, a global quantitative assessment considering the cumulative effect of several wildfires is still missing. Here we present a global assessment of post-fire soil erosion, considering cumulative wildfire-driven geomorphological changes over the last two decades. We estimate global trends of post-fire soil erosion using a global database on wildfire occurrence and fire severity, and the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model together with the recovery of those burned landscapes by remote sensed data. Our results show that when considering multiple wildfire events, global post-fire soil erosion accounts for 8.1 ± 0.72 Pg annually, representing 19% of the global soil erosion budget and an additional 5.1 ± 0.56 Pg soil erosion annually in comparison to pre-fire conditions. Moreover, soil erosion attributed to the first post-fire year represents 31% of the total soil erosion, whereas the remaining share can be attributed to previous wildfire occurrences. Globally, Africa is the continent that is impacted the most in terms of post-fire soil erosion, given its substantially larger burned area. Our results illustrate the magnitude of post-fire soil erosion globally and therefore support post-fire management actions towards the mitigation and restoration of affected areas and policies towards land-degradation neutrality.

 Aerosols can influence vegetation through multiple processes, yet the resulting biophysical climate feedback from the vegetation response remains poorly understood. Here, using an ensemble of Earth system models and an observation-based empirical model, we show that the vegetation response to complete removal of anthropogenic aerosols can either cool or warm the local climate by up to 0.039 ± 0.020 °C (multimodel mean ± intermodel standard deviation) through altering albedo and evapotranspiration. This feedback exhibits distinct latitudinal asymmetry, resulting, on average, in cooling (–0.0083 ± 0.0070 °C) in boreal regions, moderate cooling (–0.0036 ± 0.0017 °C) in temperate zones, and slight warming (0.0007 ± 0.0011 °C) in the tropics (excluding the Amazon). Future projections suggest that stringent aerosol control could amplify the local cooling effect of vegetation across most vegetated areas. These findings reveal a previously overlooked pathway by which aerosols influence vegetation climate effects, highlighting the need for integrated policies on air quality control and vegetation-based climate solutions."

 Offline aridity and drought diagnostics typically project widespread terrestrial drying under climate change, whereas fully coupled Earth system models (ESMs) often simulate modest or regionally heterogeneous changes—and in some regions increasing—runoff. This long-standing divergence has been attributed largely to missing vegetation physiological effects and the neglect of sub-annual climate variability in offline diagnostic frameworks. Here, we show that a more fundamental issue is the violation of the diagnostic framework’s structural requirement that potential evapotranspiration (PET) and precipitation (P) act as independent climatic constraints. Using Penman and Penman–Monteith formulations, each with and without thermodynamic deflation via the complementary evaporation principle (CEP), we demonstrate that land–atmosphere feedbacks embedded in conventional PET estimates induce strong negative P–PET correlations (−0.45 ± 0.29; mean ± standard deviation) across land surfaces, which collapse toward near zero (−0.02 ± 0.42) after CEP deflation. Preserving PET–P independence substantially reduces inflation of the aridity index and brings offline diagnostic ET trends closer to ESM projections under a strong-emission scenario (from +0.61 to +0.39 mm yr−2; ESM mean: +0.28 mm yr−2). These results indicate that structural inconsistencies—rather than missing physiological processes alone—play a central role in the mismatch between offline diagnostics and ESM hydrology. Ensuring that PET is not inflated by land–atmosphere feedbacks is therefore essential for theoretically valid offline hydrologic assessments under a warming climate."

 Recent counterintuitive cooling in the eastern tropical Pacific, with prolonged impacts on global climate, has perplexed the climate community regarding its underlying causes. While previous studies have proposed many potential explanations, the present study identifies a distinct and previously underappreciated driver. Here, by conducting a series of sensitivity experiments, we demonstrate that an intensified annual cycle of sea surface temperature in the tropical Atlantic can also drive a cooling in the eastern tropical Pacific over the past decades. The intensified annual cycle significantly alters the distribution of seasonal precipitation, leading to a net reduction of annual mean precipitation in the equatorial Atlantic. This dry state is accompanied by lower-troposphere divergence, inducing easterly anomalies along the equatorial Pacific and ultimately leading to a strong Pacific cooling. Our findings unveil a previously overlooked role of the tropical Atlantic annual cycle change in regulating tropical Pacific climate and shaping large-scale climate patterns.

 Droughts and heatwaves are linked through different land-atmosphere coupling pathways. While high temperatures and depleted soil moisture (SM) characterize all drought-heatwave events, latent heat flux (LHF) reveals the dominant forcing mechanism driving these events. Our grid-based analysis of six drought-heatwave events since 2000 shows spatially inhomogeneous land-atmosphere coupling associated with surface flux partitioning. Atmospherically driven regimes, characterized by increased LHF following hot temperature anomalies, accounted for the majority of the 2022 East Asia event (64.8%). Land surface-driven regimes, exhibiting LHF deficits following dry SM anomalies, were most prevalent in the 2023 Central America event (45.4%). Using a medium-range forecast model, we reproduced both events and showed that the water-limited (2023 Central America) case exhibits a lead-time predictability improvement of about 2-3 days relative to the energy-limited (2022 East Asia) case. These results highlight the limits of domain-averaged coupling in the model and the potential to improve the model forecasted drought-heatwaves when incorporate regime-based characteristics.

 Desert is a crucial component of terrestrial ecosystems, and its optical reflection properties are essential for understanding land surface radiative balance. Combining the hyperspectral and angular measurements has been considered as an effective method to characterize optical reflection properties of desert surfaces. However, the ground and satellite-based instruments cannot obtain both hyperspectral and angular reflectance of desert surfaces at appropriate scales due to the limitations of their measurement configurations. We employed an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a spectrometer to perform hyperspectral BRDF measurements of six desert areas in Northwest China to overcome the limitations. In the comparison with those obtained from laboratory and satellite observations at the same geometries, it is found that UAV-measured hyperspectral reflectance has a spectral shape similar to that of spectra measured in laboratory settings, and UAV-measured angular reflectance shows a good match of BRDF characterization as the satellite observations in the hemispherical space. Moreover, we compared the modeled angular reflectance, which are derived from BRDF models, with measured angular reflectance of deserts at selected wavelengths from MODIS. The BRDF models using UAV-measured hyperspectral BRDF have superior performance in spectral BRDF simulation. The uncertainty analysis based on a Bayesian inversion further confirmed the reliability of the UAV data in effectively characterizing optical properties of the desert surface. These results demonstrate the robustness of UAV-based spectral and angular measurements in quantifying the hyperspectral BRDF, which provide comprehensive in-situ optical properties of desert surfaces. These data can serve as valuable validation for future studies on radiative balance of desert surfaces."

 The slip-surface geometry of a landslide is crucial for stability analysis and early warning, making its accurate and detailed characterization essential for hazard assessment and mitigation. However, traditional methods for obtaining slip-surface geometry are resource-intensive, requiring significant manpower and materials. Some studies have used the three-dimensional (3D) deformation from remote sensing data to infer detailed slip-surface geometry of landslides using the mass conservation method. However, this method usually requires prior data to calibrate the model parameters, and its underlying assumptions may not be valid for all landslide scenarios. In this study, we designed an Extended Vector Inclination Method (EVIM) to determine detailed landslide slip-surface geometry and established a framework for deriving landslide thickness based on 3D deformation derived from SAR and optical remote sensing data. The experiments based on actual events (Hooskanaden, Shangxintian, and Daopo landslide) and simulations demonstrate that EVIM can reliably estimate landslide thickness in a manner consistent with in-situ measurements. Furthermore, simulations indicate that the magnitude of deformation and the error in the constrained 3D deformation affect the accuracy of our method. We conclude that in cases where the mass conservation method is difficult to apply (e.g., landslides lacking prior information), the EVIM may serve as an alternative method. The proposed framework enables rapid slip-surface inversion, making it well-suited for regional-scale landslide stability assessments."

 Wildfires represent a devastating global natural hazard, with profound ecological, economic, and societal impacts. Accurate prediction of fire behavior is paramount, yet state-of-the-art models like WRF-Fire often neglect the critical meteorological feedbacks induced by fire-emitted aerosols. To address this gap, this study develops a novel modeling framework that integrates WRF-Chem with WRF-Fire to systematically quantify how smoke-radiation interactions influence near-surface meteorology and subsequent fire behavior. Through a series of sensitivity experiments, we demonstrate that fire emissions trigger a complex, time-dependent feedback loop. Initially, aerosols suppress near-surface winds and moderate temperatures in our simulations, leading to a slower Rate of Spread (ROS) and a constrained burned area. However, as the fire persists, the accumulated emissions fundamentally alter the local atmosphere, intensifying the wind field through fire-induced circulations. This results in a dramatic reversal, with the ”With Fire” scenario subsequently exhibiting the most rapid fire front propagation. Our analysis reveals that the integrated radiative effect of all aerosols, rather than the contribution of any single species like black carbon (BC) or organic carbon (OC), is the dominant driver of these meteorological perturbations. This work concludes that incorporating these dynamic, time-evolving aerosol-meteorology-fire feedbacks is not a mere refinement but a crucial necessity for advancing the predictive accuracy of wildfire models, especially for extreme events, thereby informing more effective mitigation and response strategies."

This study diagnoses the spatial structure and examines temporal evolution of intercity-scale (tens of kilometers) and neighborhood-scale (a few kilometers) PM2.5 components, separated from background variation including long-range transport, by applying a recently proposed spatial decomposition framework based on spatial coherence to long-term air quality monitoring network data in South Korea (2016–2023). Within this framework, a hierarchical averaging scheme uses coherence-based neighboring stations to define the intercity-scale variability of background-removed PM2.5 concentrations. Focusing on the cold season (DJFM), spatial diagnosis reveals dominant intercity-scale contributions in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) and neighboring industrialized areas, highlighting the effectiveness of air control zone-based policies. In contrast, neighborhood-scale contributions predominate in high-PM2.5 stations, particularly in the Southeastern Area (SEA), indicating the need for localized interventions. Temporal analysis reveals a structural transition beginning in 2019/20 DJFM, characterized by simultaneous trend reversals: intercity-scale components shifted from increasing to decreasing in the SMA, an area with intensive urban and industrial emissions, while the opposite occurred in the SEA, a coastal city cluster. This transition coincided with the implementation of the Seasonal PM Management policy and the COVID-19 lockdown. The variations in the intercity-scale component broadly align with residual emission intensities of PM2.5 and NOx, defined as deviations from national emission trends based on the Clean Air Policy Support System emission inventory. These results reveal a structural shift in intercity-scale PM2.5 variability and its linkage to emissions, offering a scalable diagnostic tool for evaluating policy effectiveness and underscoring the need for scale-specific air quality management strategies."

Hence, the decomposition of climate variability into a forced response and internal variability is essential to understand climate change. Especially how the hydrological cycle will change is still uncertain. Here, we use ensemble simulations to elucidate the forced response and internal variability changes in a hot world beyond 2100 in the Community Earth System Model version 2. We extract the dominant modes of the forced response and of internal variability. The dominant mode of the forced response of the hydrological cycle changes sign in the early 22nd century, even though greenhouse gas emissions are decreasing. We find that pronounced atmospheric circulation changes are largely responsible for the hydrological cycle shift. The dominant modes of internal variability exhibit significant reduced amplitude of the variability after the forced response mode changes its sign, suggesting that the forced response has significant impact on internal variability. These results have implications for anthropogenic climate change beyond 2100."

The United Arab Emirates was the hardest hit, experiencing widespread flooding, four fatalities, and economic damages exceeding USD 544 million. Analysis of multiple precipitation datasets confirmed that this was the most intense daily rainfall event ever recorded in the region. To investigate the system responsible, a state-of-the-art storm-tracking algorithm was applied to reconstruct the evolution of the mesoscale convective system that caused the hazard. Findings revealed that peak intensity occurred on 16 April, contributing more than 70% of the total event rainfall. Synoptic-scale diagnostics pointed to the rare convergence of two key drivers: enhanced low-level moisture transport via a strengthened Somali low-level jet (SLLJ) and an unusually strong Arabian Cold Vortex in the mid-troposphere. Long-term reanalysis data indicate that such a combination is extremely rare, observed on only 0.006% of all days in the 1940–2024 daily record, previously exceeded only during the 2019 Iran floods. However, forecasts from 11 models in the International Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) archive consistently underestimated rainfall (mean bias of −63.6%), due to the severe underestimation of the SLLJ and the moderate overestimation of 500 hPa geopotential height. These results underscore the growing threat of extreme precipitation in arid regions and emphasize the urgent need to improve model capabilities in forecasting moisture dynamics and upper-level disturbances under the changing climate."

Positive matrix factorization was applied (individually and in a combined input dataset) to aerosol mass spectrometry measurements at both sites, providing notably insights into the challenges of attributing real sources to organic aerosol (OA) factors and the impact of instrumental result specificities leading to differences in OA mass spectra. 
 Source apportionment analyses of carbonaceous aerosol were conducted at two neighboring urban sites in Strasbourg, France, during the winter of 2019/2020 using ACSMs (Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitors; for non-refractory submicron aerosols), aethalometers (AE33; for equivalent Black Carbon – eBC) and filter-based offline chemical speciation. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) was applied to organic aerosols (OA) following two strategies: (i) analyzing each site individually, (ii) combining both sites into a single dataset. Both methods resolved five OA factors: hydrocarbon-like (HOA), biomass burning (BBOA), cooking-like (COA-like), oxygenated (OOA), and an amine-related OA (58-OA) factor. The latter factor, accounting for ∼ 4 % of the total OA mass at each site, showed clear diel profiles and a distinct origin marked by specific wind directions, suggesting a unique local source, potentially linked to industrial emissions. The present study also highlights the challenge of attributing a cooking-only origin to the COA-like factor, which exhibited a diel cycle similar to biomass burning OA at the background site. The combined PMF analysis improved the apportionment of cooking emissions at nighttime, especially for the traffic site, compared to individual PMF analyses, but it did not enhance the other OA factors due to instrumental specificities (i.e., different fragmentation patterns) leading to differences in OA mass spectra between the two instruments. Overall, this study argues for careful inspection of instrumental peculiarities in ACSM and AE33 data treatment and provides hints to benefit from their use at various locations at the city scale. It also allows comparison between different types of PMF analyses, showing that combined PMF may not be appropriate for improving the consistency of OA factors in some cases such as the one presented here."

Field data showed Tibet’s brown carbon absorbs about 10 times less than Guangzhou’s, due to cleaner air. Yet, over 75 % of its light absorption still comes from primary emission, which causes over 98 % of its climate-warming effect in both places. This study advances understanding of brown carbon dynamics and its sources in diverse environments for global climate effects. 
 To investigate optical properties, sources, and radiative effects of brown carbon (BrC), we conducted synchronous field campaigns in the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (Yangbajing) and urban Guangzhou in July 2022, using multi-wavelength Aethalometer (AE33) and aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) measurements. Total aerosol and BrC light absorption coefficients at 370 nm (Abstotal: 1.6 ± 1.6 M m−1; BrC: 0.2 ± 0.3 M m−1) in Tibet were an order of magnitude lower than Guangzhou, attributed to extremely low aerosol/organic aerosol (OA) mass concentrations. However, BrC fractions in Abstotal (15 % vs. 21 % at 370 nm) correlated with primary OA (POA) ratios, highlighting anthropogenic emission impacts even in this clean background. Diurnal variations (morning/evening peaks) of source-specific BrC absorption were regulated by local emissions (e.g., biomass burning, traffic emission) and regional secondary formation. Source apportionment revealed primary sources (biomass burning OA (BBOA), hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA)) dominated BrC absorption (> 75 %). The mass absorption cross-section (MAC) of HOA (2.08 m2 g−1 in Tibet; 2.57 m2 g−1 in Guangzhou) was comparable to that of BBOA (1.11–2.54 m2 g−1 in Tibet; 1.91 m2 g−1 in Guangzhou), indicating the high light absorption capacity of BrC from fossil fuel. Integrated “simple forcing efficiency” (370–660 nm) showed primary emissions contributed > 98 % of total radiative forcing at both sites. This study advances understanding of BrC dynamics and sources in diverse environments, underscores primary sources' critical role in BrC absorption, and emphasizes the need for source-specific OA optical parameterization."

We reproduced detailed observations from a lidar and a wind-lidar using an advanced instrument simulator to evaluate how well the model represents clouds. A dedicated module was developed for the wind-lidar. Both instruments reveal comparable cloud biases, confirming its value for improving model evaluation and enabling consistent multi-decade assessments with more recent sensors. 
 In Earth's radiative budget, clouds play a central role but their representation in General Circulation Models (GCMs) remains a major source of uncertainty for climate projection. Here, we used spaceborne lidar observations to assess cloud distribution in the IPSL-CM6-LR model using the CFMIP Observation Simulator Package (COSP). We focused on the lidars onboard CALIPSO and AEOLUS satellites during 2006–2023 and 2018–2023. While CALIPSO has been widely used for GCMs evaluation, AEOLUS was originally designed for wind profiling. However, studies have demonstrated its potential to retrieve reliable cloud profiles. A new module was developed to simulate AEOLUS observations within COSP-lidar, extending original implementations made for CALIPSO, including wavelength change (532 to 355 nm), viewing geometry (35° off-nadir) and specific parameters adjustments related to sensivity and resolution. We compared our simulations to 1-year observations for both instruments. Results show that AEOLUS observations can effectively evaluate clouds in GCMs, as it shows similar cloud fraction biases in IPSL-CM6-LR to those obtained with CALIPSO. Significant underestimations of low (up to 20 %) and high clouds in certain regions (e.g. warm pool) were re-assessed for this model. Sensitivity analyses highlighted the small role of instrument-specific parameters in COSP-lidar: viewing geometry, multiple scattering coefficient and cloud detection threshold (associated with wavelength and sensivity). This work lays the foundation for a consistent multi-decades evaluation of cloud representation using different lidar missions, and supports the integration of EarthCARE/ATLID in COSP-lidar for further model evaluation."

First results reveal spatiotemporal patterns in temperature, humidity, fog, and aerosol profiles, proving RoLi's technical capability to resolve the diel interplay of convectively mixed daytime and stable stratified nighttime conditions. 
 The Amazon rain forest plays an important role in the biogeochemistry, water cycle, and climate of the South American continent and the Earth system. The Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO) has been established to study and quantify forest–atmosphere interactions under natural conditions, as well as the transformation of the Amazon ecosystem as a result of increasing perturbations related to deforestation and climate change. Here, we present the design and first results of a custom-made Robotic Lift system, RoLi, installed to automatically measure high-resolution vertical profiles along the 325 m tall ATTO tower at high spatial and temporal resolution at vertical profiling speeds up to 0.5 m s−1. The RoLi payload of up to 80 kg can be flexibly adjusted and comprises meteorological, trace gas, and aerosol instruments with short inlet lines, minimizing potential wall losses and related artifacts that may occur in longer sampling tubes of tall towers. First measurement results show spatiotemporal patterns in the altitude profiles of temperature, humidity, fog, and aerosol particle concentration and size. This proves RoLi's technical capability to resolve the diel interplay of convectively mixed daytime and stable stratified nighttime conditions. The RoLi data will help to better constrain the gradients and exchange of air masses, gases, and particles across the forest–atmosphere interface and related mixing processes in the lowermost planetary boundary layer."

Improvements in radiometric and wavelength calibration reduce spectral fitting uncertainties and enhance agreement with ozonesonde profiles and Pandora total ozone measurements. 
 This study presents the first comprehensive description of the operational GEMS (Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer) ozone profile retrieval algorithm and evaluates the performance of the reprocessed version 3.0 dataset. The retrieval operates in the 310–330 nm spectral range and yields total degrees of freedom for ozone ranging from 1.5 to 3. Although the vertical sensitivity is limited, GEMS achieves an effective vertical resolution of 5–10 km and is capable of separating tropospheric and stratospheric ozone layers. This work highlights significant algorithmic and calibration improvements in version 3.0. Radiometric offsets in irradiance measurements are corrected using a scaling factor derived from the average ratio to a solar reference, while residual wavelength-dependent biases in the normalized radiance are further mitigated through soft calibration. In addition, shift corrections are applied separately to irradiance and radiance wavelengths. As a result, version 3.0 significantly reduces spectral fitting residuals, lowering them from 0.8 % in version 2.0 to 0.2 % under nominal conditions. This improvement also mitigates altitude-dependent oscillating biases observed in the previous version (+40 DU in the troposphere, −20 DU in the stratosphere). The version 3 ozone profiles show agreements within ±10 DU of ozonesonde observations, with a mean bias of −7.7 % in tropospheric ozone columns and within 5 % in the stratosphere. Furthermore, the retrievals capture day-to-day vertical ozone variability, as demonstrated by comparisons with daily ozonesonde launches in February and March 2024. Integrated ozone columns derived from the profiles also show improved consistency with ground-based total ozone measurements, yielding a mean bias of −3.6 DU and outperforming the GEMS operational total column ozone product."

This enables a more comprehensive understanding of hydrometeor fall speeds and vertical air motions in precipitation systems. 
 With the Doppler velocity (Vd) measurements from the Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) onboard the Earth Cloud Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE), it has become possible to observe the vertical motions of hydrometeors inside cloud and precipitation globally. While W-band radar observations by CPR can capture clouds and upper-level ice hydrometeors well, Ku- and Ka-band radar observations by the Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) onboard the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Core Observatory are more effective under conditions involving rain or moderate-to-heavy ice precipitation, where attenuation and multiple scattering hinder reliable reflectivity measurements by CPR. This study constructed the EarthCARE–GPM coincidence observation dataset and investigated hydrometeor fall speeds and vertical air motion in stratiform and convective precipitation systems by integrating the complementary information from the two radars. Two case studies were conducted for stratiform and convective events, along with statistical analyses of reflectivity and Vd using nearly one year of dataset. CPR well captured ice particle growth in the upper troposphere above −10 °C, while DPR captured the properties of larger hydrometeors in the lower layers, including melting and rain layers. Vd generally increased with decreasing altitude, which is consistent with particle growth inferred from reflectivity observations from both CPR and DPR. Classification into four precipitation types based on echo top heights showed distinct differences in vertical profiles. In deep stratiform cases, Vd reveals slow downward speeds above the melting layer and faster speeds below, consistent with the bright band observed by DPR. Vd in deep convective types indicates faster-falling speed of densely rimed ice particles with high reflectivity and the presence of stronger updrafts and turbulence compared to stratiform cases. These findings indicate that Vd can provide insights into dynamical and microphysical processes inside deep clouds where the quality of reflectivity measurements in W-band deteriorates, and support future development of algorithms for precipitation retrieval and classification using Vd."

The dataset accurately captures the spatiotemporal variations in soil temperature at multiple depths, offering valuable scientific insights for agricultural management and ecological research. 
 Soil temperature (Ts) is critical in regulating agricultural production, ecosystem functions, hydrological cycling and climate dynamics. However, the inherent spatial and temporal heterogeneity of soil thermal regimes constitutes a persistent challenge in obtaining high-resolution, continuous gridded Ts datasets along vertical profiles. To address this issue, we propose a spatially adaptive layer-cascading Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm to generate daily multi-layer Ts data (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 40 cm) at a spatial resolution of 1 km in China from 2010 to 2020. The methodology dynamically partitions non-uniformly distributed measuring sites (2093 sites across the country) to quadtrees and incorporates thermal coupling effects propagated between neighbor soil layers. Multi-source data, including satellite retrievals of land surface temperature and vegetation index, and ERA5 reanalysis climate variables were used as inputs. Validation using both spatially independent test sets and flux-tower observations demonstrated the robustness and accuracy of the product. It is noted the model's performance was lower in summers and winters than in springs and autumns. Compared to existing global or regional Ts products, the dataset developed here is characterized by its fine spatio-temporal patterns and high reliability, enabling it to provide supports for precision agriculture, ecosystem modeling and understanding climate-land feedback.

The dataset includes icebergs larger than 0.04 km², with details on their locations, sizes, and shapes. It shows significant changes in iceberg number and area, mainly driven by major ice shelf calving events – especially in the Weddell Sea. This resource fills key gaps in understanding iceberg impacts on the ocean and climate. 
 The distribution of Antarctic icebergs is crucial for understanding their impact on the Southern Ocean's atmosphere and physical environment, as well as their role in global climate change. Recent advancements in iceberg databases, based on remote sensing imagery and altimetry data, have led to products like the BYU/NIC iceberg database, the Altiberg database, and high-resolution SAR-based iceberg distribution data. However, no unified database exists that integrates various iceberg scales and covers the entire Southern Ocean. Our research  presents a comprehensive circum-Antarctic iceberg dataset, developed using Sentinel-1 SAR imagery from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, covering the Southern Ocean south of 55° S. A semi-automated classification method that integrated incremental random forest classification with manual correction was applied to extract icebergs larger than 0.04 km2, resulting in a dataset for each October from 2018 to 2023. The resulting dataset documents the geographic coordinates and geometric attributes of icebergs (area, perimeter, major axis, and minor axis), provides uncertainty estimates for area, and, under a fixed density assumption, employs the Iceberg Size Scaling to derive iceberg mass along with the associated uncertainty bounds. The dataset reveals significant interannual variability in iceberg number and total area. Specifically, the number of icebergs increased from 34 825 in 2018 to approximately 51 420 in 2021, while the total area expanded from 38 668 to 52 276 km2, both corresponding to major ice shelf calving events, followed by a decline in 2022. The annual average total iceberg area is 44 859 ± 4900 km2, and the average mass is 9162 ± 1935 Gt. Validation using test set samples shows that the integrated incremental random forest classification achieves accuracy, recall, and F1-score exceeding 0.90. Comparisons with existing iceberg products (including the BYU/NIC iceberg database and the Altiberg database) indicate a high consistency in spatial distribution, while our dataset demonstrates clear advantages in terms of spatial coverage, iceberg detection scale, and identification capabilities in regions with dense sea ice. This dataset serves as a novel data resource for investigating the impact of Antarctic icebergs on the Southern Ocean, the mass balance of ice sheets, the mechanisms underlying ice shelf collapse, and the response mechanisms of iceberg disintegration to climate change.

This model is used to fill in the ocean surface temperature data that is missing in satellite observations due to the orbital gap of polar-orbiting satellites. 
 High-resolution observation is crucial for studying surface temperatures characterized by complex variations, particularly surface air temperatures in oceanic regions, which serve as significant indicators of sea-air coupling changes. Due to the scarcity of conventional observations of surface atmospheric temperatures in these areas, high-resolution surface atmospheric temperature data derived from satellite inversion has become the primary source of information. However, missing data resulting from factors such as the orbital spacing of polar satellites, cloud cover, sensor errors, and other disruptions poses substantial challenges to Earth Surface Temperature (EST) estimation. In this paper, we introduce ESTD-Net, a novel deep learning-based model designed for surface temperature data inpainting. ESTD-Net incorporates an enhanced multi-head context attention mechanism and a modified transformer block to capture long-range pixel dependencies, thereby improving the model's ability to focus on boundary regions. Additionally,the Stage Two employs a convolutional U-Net in an autoregressive manner to refine the coarse output from the Stage One, enhancing local spatial continuity and smoothing boundaries. In addition, we adapt two loss components – weighted reconstruction loss and gradient consistency regularization – to the specific demands of Earth surface temperature interpolation. Our ablation studies confirm that their integration significantly improves spatial consistency and accuracy, particularly in textureless regions and in maintaining physically meaningful gradients. Evaluation results demonstrate that ESTD-Net outperforms existing methods in both pixel-level accuracy and perceptual quality. Our approach offers a robust and reliable solution for restoring earth surface temperature data."

The largest emission source is on-site combustion and processes at steel plants (49% of total emissions), followed by raw material plant operations and transport (23%) and off-site electricity generation (15%). Plant-level lifecycle emission intensities range from 0.4 to 2.5 mt CO2e per mt raw steel produced across plants. Across steel production pathways, basic oxygen furnace (BOF) and electric arc furnace (EAF) plants have production-weighted average emission intensities of 2.0 and 0.8 mt CO2e per mt raw steel produced, respectively. Emission intensities also vary across geographies and firms due to differences in supply chains, electricity supply, and production technologies. This study provides important insights for assessing climate mitigation pathways, investment decisions, and policies."

Despite their minimal contribution to total aerosol mass, these particles have high surface-to-volume ratios, making them highly reactive and capable of penetrating deep into the respiratory tract. Here we show that biosolid processing facilities can emit nanoparticles. Repeated and persistent episodes of elevated particle number concentrations (PNs) were observed downwind from a facility, frequently exceeding 200,000 cm–3 for particles between 5 and 20 nm in mobility diameter. The PN correlated with elevated CO2 levels used as a tracer for bacterial respiration. Emission factors ranged from 4.4 × 1014 to 3.7 × 1015 (kg CO2)–1. Transmission electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy shows that particles were composed primarily of carbon, with some sulfur, nitrogen, and phosphorus. The observed agglomerated morphology suggests that the nucleation mode particles were either solid or highly viscous. The elevated number concentrations and morphology are consistent with particle formation via gas-phase nucleation, likely triggered by fugitive volatile organic compound emissions from the facility. Further research is needed to fully assess their impact on local air quality and public health."

However, accurately quantifying its global distribution and absorption remains challenging for numerical models, stemming from its complex composition, variable optical properties, and dynamic atmospheric transformations. This study developed an absorptivity basis set module for BrC (ABS-BrC) simulation, which categorizes BrC into four classes based on light-absorbing ability and accounts for chemical aging processes to better represent the variability in BrC absorption. Global simulations using ABS-BrC reveal notable disparities between source contributions to BrC concentrations and their associated absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD). While secondary formation dominates global BrC concentrations (45.8%), its contribution to AAOD is disproportionately small (16.6%). In contrast, wildfire-sourced BrC, despite contributing less than a third of the total concentration, is responsible for the majority (54.2%) of global BrC AAOD. Notably, dark BrC (d-BrC), a strongly absorbing and water-insoluble subset, contributes 30–64% to global BrC AAOD. Its contribution is particularly critical in the Arctic during JJA and SON, where it accounts for 67% of BrC absorption, highlighting its critical role in polar warming. Implementing the ABS-BrC module in Earth system models is recommended for a more accurate assessment of BrC’s radiative impact on the atmosphere and cryosphere."

In this work, we present a dual-functional design strategy through Al3+ doping and phosphate modification to engineer electronic reconfigured, acid-tailored CoMn microspherical spinel for chlorobenzene (CB) deep oxidation. Systematic characterizations combined with theoretical calculations indicated that Al-induced charge redistribution creates electron-deficient Co and Mn metal centers that promote electron density rearrangement of the O 2p orbital, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). Phosphate coordination further boosted the Bro̷nsted acid sites (BASs) while enhancing ROS activity. In CB oxidation, the modified CoMn spinel not only exhibited high HCl selectivity but also deeply oxidized CB and its intermediates due to abundant surface ROSs and rapid O2 activation. Finally, a tandem catalytic system was proposed for the efficient simultaneous elimination of NOx and CB, achieving over 90% NOx and CB conversions within a wide temperature range (210–400 °C). This work establishes a general paradigm for designing multifunctional catalysts through orbital hybridization and acid–base synergy, particularly applicable to industrial multipollutant control scenarios."

Substantial evidence demonstrates a significant positive association between bioaerosol exposure and adverse respiratory outcomes, yet accurate health risk assessment remains constrained due to inadequate in vitro exposure models. Thus, an exposure system at the air–liquid interface was established to simulate exposure of environmentally relevant Pseudomonas aeruginosa(P. aeruginosa bioaerosol to respiratory epithelial cells. The primary normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells and immortalized 16HBE cell line were used as comparative exposure models. NHBE cells exhibited significantly higher sensitivity to 105 CFU/m3 P. aeruginosa bioaerosol, with cell viability decreasing by 58.3% ± 1.4% in NHBE cells versus 43.8% ± 14.9% in 16HBE cells (p < 0.05). Distinct immune recognition mechanisms were further observed, and 16HBE cells recognized P. aeruginosa through toll-like receptors, RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and cytosolic DNA-sensing (cGAS-STING), whereas NHBE cells primarily relied on NLRs, triggering a distinct downstream immune effector. Further, immortalization of cells resulted in baseline alterations. 16HBE cells demonstrated impaired barrier integrity and reduced proliferative capacity but compensatory hyperactivation of pattern recognition receptors, whereas NHBE cells mounted a comprehensive immune response concurrent with greater cytotoxicity. Reduced cytotoxicity of the P. aeruginosa bioaerosol in 16HBE cells underestimated bioaerosol risk significantly. This study elucidated functional disparities between immortalized cells and primary cells and revealed the limitation of cell lines in health risk assessment."

Concentrations exhibited pronounced regional disparities, with the combined levels in two megacities─Lagos, Nigeria (512,000 pg/m3) and Beijing, China (258,000 pg/m3) exceeding by more than 1.5-fold the combined total levels observed across the rest of the world (∼459,000 pg/m3). Evidence of long-range atmospheric transport was observed at remote sites in western Canada (Little Fox Lake and Whistler), influenced by trans-Pacific air trajectories during the sampling period. These findings underscore the substantial global heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of CPs and the heavily disproportionate contributions of a few regions. Notably, the major producers/emitters, such as China, had several years of delay in ratifying the SCCP listing under the Stockholm Convention (Annex A, elimination since 2017 for congeners with > 48% chlorine content), and some countries have yet to ratify. Without the timely implementation of regulatory measures in these jurisdictions, global concentrations are expected to remain stagnant or even increase if emissions persist at current levels. These results further suggest that substantial time lags are likely before measurable declines in SCCP concentrations, and potentially in recently listed MCCPs, are observed even in regions where control measures are already in place. Hence, this global data set serves as a baseline for future assessments of temporal and spatial trends."

Deformation is dominated by a co‐eruptive dike intrusion extending over 25 km, accompanied by ground fissures of about 1.5 m opening in Goma (Democratic Republic of Congo) and Gisenyi (Rwanda). Joint inversions of four interferograms with GNSS data resolved a maximum dike opening near 10 m and a volumetric increase of about 180 Mm3. The inferred dike geometry aligns with observed ground deformation and seismicity, underscoring the coupling between magmatic and tectonic processes."

Two factors contribute: the system becomes water‐limited, resulting in reduction of supersaturation by growing aerosol particles to the activation diameter; and the activation process becomes kinetically limited. Dry aerosol diameter exerts a strong influence on activation time, with a power‐law exponent of 9/2 $9/2$. Kinetically limited activation occurs when the ratio of the activation and droplet residence times is greater than unity. The findings demonstrate that a haze‐dominated state, where cloud formation is suppressed, can be achieved not only with weak supersaturation forcing and high aerosol concentration but also with large, hygroscopic aerosol particles. These results have implications for cloud formation in polluted environments, fog development near the ocean, and hygroscopic cloud seeding."

Here, the future changes in East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and weather extremes responding to the idealized local emission reductions of anthropogenic aerosols (AA) in China are investigated based on time‐slice simulations in an aerosol‐climate model together with a localized carbon neutral emission scenario, while greenhouse gases and other anthropogenic climate forcers are kept at the present‐day (2015) levels. The AA reduction in China leads to a positive change in June–July–August (JJA) mean effective radiative forcing over eastern China in 2030 and 2060s, along with a 0.2°C–0.4°C warming, respectively. It intensifies the temperature difference between land and ocean, and increases the precipitation over eastern China. Multiple EASM indices show that EASM intensity in JJA is estimated to be strengthened in the future, because of the AA decline in China. The AA emissions reduction toward carbon neutrality in China also presents a potential side effect of intensifying the summertime extreme temperatures and precipitation in China. This study reveals the important role of reductions of AA emissions in influencing EASM and weather extremes, which warrants careful assessment in the emission policymaking process prior to the implementation of mitigation strategies."

 Since the 1990s, inter-tropical Africa (ITA) has experienced consecutive calamitous droughts during the boreal spring. Although the observed precipitation regime changes have been attributed to tropical Indian Ocean-western Pacific warming and/or tropical Pacific La Niña-like cooling, the model-projected past-to-future widespread wetting response to anthropogenic warming overshadows qualitative attributions of decadal shifts in historical precipitation regimes and the reliability of near-term projections. The causes of ITA precipitation regime shifts and the likelihood of their future continuation remain unclear. Here, we reveal that the observed monopolar precipitation changes in ITA are primarily driven by the tropical easterly jet (TEJ)-dominated pattern, with a secondary contribution from the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ)-mediated pattern. The Indo-Pacific warming-induced TEJ strengthening favors a monopolar drying trend from 1950 to 2022, while the northward-shifted ITCZ drives a west drying-east wetting dipolar pattern. Considering an observational TEJ constraint, an accelerated TEJ with an amplitude of -2 standard deviations could cause an almost threefold increase in extreme drying trends in the near term (2026–2045). Instead, ITA could face a higher likelihood of extreme wetting tendency due to a near-term TEJ weakening. Our findings underscore the importance of realistic TEJ simulations in enhancing confidence in future precipitation projections across hydroclimate-vulnerable Africa."

 Microalgae emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can profoundly impact climate by leading to new particle formation and influencing clouds. Among these VOCs, dimethyl-sulphide (DMS) is of particular interest due to its key role in atmospheric processes. Despite its importance, many detailed processes linking microalgae and sea-atmosphere interactions remain poorly understood. We investigated the response of a freshwater and saltwater microalgal species of haptophytes known to produce DMS, to air entrainment and bubble-bursting mechanisms relevant for wave-breaking over the ocean. We show that bubbling resulted in the successful aerosolisation of microalgae and concurrent emission of DMS. In contrast, only background levels of DMS were detected when bubbling ceased, suggesting a critical role of bubbles in the sea-air exchange of DMS under the studied conditions. DMS mixing ratios were not correlated with the emitted particle concentrations and decreased over time, while particle concentrations remained stable. Bubbling also significantly reduced the viability of aquatic microalgae. Approximately half of the aerosolised microalgae were viable upon emission, but were not able to grow during subsequent cultivation recovery. Thus, the potential for microalgae to disperse to new environments via aerosolization is low, while their climate impact through the release of DMS remains substantial."

 Since 2014, a series of China's water resource management policies have been implemented to mitigate groundwater-induced land subsidence in the North China Plain (NCP). While previous studies have demonstrated the benefits of Synthetic Aperture Radar interferometry (InSAR) in providing policy-relevant insights into the spatio-temporal dynamics of subsidence and groundwater recovery, most have focused on localized regions, leaving the long-term impact of these measures across the entire NCP insufficiently evaluated. A key challenge is the variation of long-wavelength errors in each SAR frame, which results in inconsistencies in the subsidence velocity field over large areas. To address this issue, this paper proposes a machine learning-based adjustment approach for routinely wide-area subsidence mapping and then fully evaluating land subsidence and associated groundwater depletion in the NCP from the end of 2014 to 2022. The novelty of this method lies in the adaptive selection of the optimal model for each SAR frame, which minimizes the varying long-wavelength errors, rather than relying on a unified model for all SAR frames as commonly used in state-of-the-art approaches. Additionally, we mitigated the difference of InSAR measurement in the overlap regions between consecutive tracks caused by the varying incidence angles by incorporating GNSS data and a plate motion model. Using synthetic and real Sentinel-1 data, we validated the performance of the proposed method against prevalent approaches through an independent GNSS validation dataset, demonstrating accuracy improvements from 3.8-17.5 mm/yr to 2.0 mm/yr. The results indicated that approximately 56,882 km2 of the NCP area experienced land subsidence greater than 20 mm/yr. The central alluvial and coastal plains were the primary areas of subsidence, with a maximum cumulative subsidence of up to 2 m. The average subsidence velocity peaked in 2018 at 38.5 mm/yr. Subsidence has been alleviated after 2021. Our results revealed the lower bound of groundwater loss from the confined aquifer in the NCP, totaling 24.9 billion m3 between the end of 2014 and 2022. Of this total, 20.2 billion m3 (81 %) was lost from October 2014 to the end of 2020, with the loss decreasing to 4.7 billion m3 (19 %) during the period from January 2021 to December 2022.

 Remote-sensing based tree maps can be used to calculate various diversity indices, but the detection probability of trees depends on size and species. We propose a novel approach combining individual tree detection (ITD) with resampling corrections (+R) which aims to simultaneously correct the size, species, and spatial distribution of trees using scalable algorithms. Using airborne laser scanning, optical data, and ground measurements, we demonstrate the compatibility of ITD+R with two different types of forests and ITD algorithms, as well as its scalability to areas exceeding 3000 km2. The tree maps were evaluated using plot-level variables and benchmarked against area-based k nearest neighbors (k-NN). The ITD+R improved ITD results for most studied metrics, with the Shannon index being an exception, and even outperformed k-NN in predicting dominant height in managed stands, though k-NN still outperformed for stem density and volume. The ITD+R approach was shown to be adaptable to various diversity indices which it has not been specifically trained on, with 254 m2 plot-level predictions correlating at r=0.42–0.91. While ITD trees could be classified with OA=82.0%–86.6% to pine, spruce, and deciduous, further research is needed to account for rare tree species, as low prevalence results in a large number of false detections which cannot be sufficiently addressed with classification alone."

 Automatic extraction of coastlines from remote sensing images is of great practical importance for coastal risk assessment, ecological environmental protection, and marine economic development. However, the highly dynamic nature of coastlines and the complex, diverse characteristics of land–sea boundaries make precise coastline extraction a challenging task. Although traditional deep learning methods have demonstrated good performance in this respect, they still face numerous shortcomings when dealing with high computational costs and the need to fully utilize multiscale features. In this paper, to address these problems, we propose a novel and efficient land–sea segmentation model for remote sensing imagery based on a classical U-shaped network structure, named DA-MiTUNet. On the one hand, we introduce the convolutional block attention module into the Mix Transformer (MiT), forming a dual-attention encoder in conjunction with an efficient self-attention mechanism. This integration ensures comprehensive extraction of global context and local information, thereby enabling more precise determination of complex land–sea boundary features. On the other hand, we propose an adaptive feature fusion module to further promote the effective fusion of features across different hierarchical levels, achieving more refined land–sea boundary segmentation. Experimental results on the Gaofen-1 Hainan Coastline Dataset (GF–HNCD) and Benchmark Sea–Land Dataset (BSD) datasets demonstrated that the proposed DA-MiTUNet model outperforms other comparative models in terms of both the average F1 score and the mean Intersection over Union value, while achieving excellent segmentation results with relatively low computational complexity, thereby reflecting the potential of our model for dynamic coastal monitoring during extreme sea level events."

 Vertical structural and spectral heterogeneity are two key remote sensing characteristics of complex forests. To enable effective forest health management and provide early warnings of abnormal disturbance, monitoring forest biochemical content with a vertically layered spectral perspective is critically needed. However, commonly used remote sensing technique still have limited capacity to study the biochemical status of the middle and lower canopy layers. This study provides the first insight into the potential of the full-waveform large-footprint hyperspectral LiDAR (LFHSL) system for retrieving the vertical heterogeneity of forest chlorophyll using 3D radiative transfer modeling. In our newly constructed LFHSL model, virtual three-dimensional (3D) complex forest scenes, comprising trees, bushes, and grass, were defined with varying positions and biochemical content inputs. Hyperspectral waveforms within the large-footprint were then simulated for each combination of vegetation position and biochemical level. The concept of spectral index time profiles (SITP), referred to as spectral index variation along the laser path, were introduced and used to assess the vertical distribution of chlorophyll for the first time in forest scenes. The main findings of this study are as follows: (1) Full-waveform LFHSL owns great potential for retrieving vertical chlorophyll content across trees, bushes, and grass layers in complex forest ecosystems. (2) SITP is a novel and essential reference indicator that fully registers chlorophyll variations along the laser path. (3) Simulations with random positions and chlorophyll contents indicate that the peak points of SITP yield higher chlorophyll prediction accuracy in trees layer and grass layer (R2: 0.996 vs. 0.971, RMSE: 1.39 vs. 3.81 μgcm−2) than that of bushes layer (R2 of 0.801, RMSE of 9.97 μgcm−2). (4) Compared to position patterns, LFHSL system is more sensitive to chlorophyll content sets. This study demonstrates that full-waveform LFHSL is a promising and surely reliable tool for acquiring and monitoring vertical vegetation health in complex forests. It not only provides significant guiding for the development of laser radar models but also holds promise for adoption in design of large-footprint multi-spectral or hyperspectral LiDAR."

 Extracting vectorized building footprints from high-resolution imagery requires precise corner localization, robust boundary connectivity, and the generation of spatially ordered topological structures that faithfully encompasses the building area. These interdependent requirements make current approaches complex, which typically rely on cascaded architectures combining heterogeneous neural networks for feature extraction and topological recovering separately. This paper proposes ABCNet, a unified CNN architecture that simultaneously extracts instance-level areas, boundaries, and corners while robustly recovering ordered topological sequences for building footprints. Specifically, we augment a standard YOLO-based instance segmentation network with dual detection heads to generate per-building instance mask scores for areas, boundaries, and corners. The initial exterior contour is derived from the instance area mask. To refine the footprint geometry beyond smoothed contour approximations, we establish geometrically ordered corner connections through a bipartite matching matrix. Each entry in this square matrix encodes the interpolated boundary probability score between two corners indexed by its row and column. Ordered relationships are estimated using path-length differences relative to the initial contour, computed from parameterized distances of orthogonally projected points along the contour. The vertex sequence direction (clockwise/counterclockwise) is resolved via the triangle inequality criterion. Finally, the topological sequence is recovered through linear-sum-assignment optimization applied to the bipartite matching matrix, giving the vectorized building. Experimental evaluation on two vectorized building extraction benchmarks demonstrates that the proposed method, despite its architectural simplicity, surpasses state-of-the-art approaches by significant margins—achieving 8.6% and 2.5% higher AP (Average Precision) under in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios, respectively; with a 3% improvement on human-annotated out-of-distribution vectorization benchmarks. Visual comparisons further reveal the method’s robustness, maintaining coherent degradation patterns even when geometric primitives are misdetected under challenging imaging conditions. The simple architecture inherently preserves design flexibility, enabling future enhancements to area, boundary, and corner detection precision through dedicated module refinements."

 The western Himalayas in Pakistan, characterized by a diverse range of conifer species at higher elevations, represent a critical biodiversity hotspot and habitat for numerous species. Accurate spatial assessments of canopy height are essential for improving estimates of aboveground biomass, carbon sequestration, and associated forest ecosystem services in this region. In this study, we estimated canopy heights in the western Himalayas in Pakistan using a U-Net CNN approach, fusing data from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation Mission (GEDI) with multi-band Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery. We produced a canopy height map at a 10 m resolution for 2020. To ensure accurate measurements across various canopy height groups, we implemented a stratified training approach that optimized the representation of GEDI data throughout the training, validation, and testing phases. We trained multiple models using varying thresholds and assigned different weights to taller trees to improve accuracy between different canopy height groups in the study region. Our best model achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 7.52 m and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 5.71 m in the test set, significantly outperforming existing global canopy height models in this topographically complex region.

 The complementary measurements of model-based multibaseline (polarimetric) synthetic aperture radar interferometry ((Pol)InSAR) and data-driven SAR tomography (TomoSAR) have become the development trend of forest height mapping missions. Their common core is the characterization of forest vertical structure, which promotes the introduction of TomoSAR reconstructed vertical structure function into (Pol)InSAR forest height inversion model. However, to provide knowledge of vertical structure, TomoSAR measurements have to cover the entire forested area. The high data acquisition cost and multibaseline observation errors hinder its application in large-scale wall-to-wall forest height mapping. Therefore, based on machine learning, this study proposes a small-scale tomography-aided multibaseline (Pol)InSAR (STAMI) framework to derive vertical structure knowledge at low data burden and estimate forest height with high accuracy. The synergy inversion is reformulated as the cross-scale clustering and classification task of the vertical structure knowledge. We conduct TomoSAR only in a small-scale forested area, and establish the mapping relationship between interferometric features and vertical structure with spectral clustering and Support Vector Machine (SVM). In large-scale mapping area, we obtain vertical structure information with only three-baseline (Pol)InSAR, which is used to construct different forest height inversion models. Finally, a reweighted method is applied to resist observation errors to different vertical structures for improving accuracy of three-baseline inversion. Airborne L- and P-band single and fully polarimetric datasets covering boreal and tropical forests are used to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework. This research is valuable for data acquisition planning and algorithm application of multibaseline (Pol)InSAR missions aimed at global forest mapping."

 Groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) provide crucial ecological and hydrological stability but are increasingly threatened by groundwater-dependent invasive plants (GDIPs), particularly in regions with limited water resources. Although GDEs have been widely studied, long-term quantitative assessments of how invasive plants alter these ecosystems remain limited. Hence, this study evaluated the impacts of invasive plants within the GDEs of the Nuwejaars Catchment, South Africa, by monitoring their spatial and temporal dynamics and quantifying the extent to which they displace native plants. Landsat-8 imagery, a Random Forest classifier, and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques were integrated to map and quantify the annual distribution of GDIPs over a 12-year period. XAI interpretability techniques including SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), partial dependence plots (PDPs), and recursive feature elimination (RFECV) were applied to identify key environmental conditions influencing GDIP occurrence. Spatial-temporal analysis revealed that GDIPs expanded from 40.9 % (1060 ha) in 2013 to 63.9 % (1660 ha) in 2024, displacing large areas of native fynbos vegetation. Inter-annual change analysis showed accelerated GDIP growth following the extreme 2015–2018 drought, which reduced groundwater availability for native species with shallow roots. Elevation, slope, and moisture vegetation indices emerged as the most influential predictors for classification, with PDPs revealing that GDIPs favoured lower elevations and steep slopes. Classification accuracy improved over time, with F1-Scores and overall accuracies ranging between 68.4 % to 82.5 % from 2013 to 2024. Overall, these findings highlight the persistent spread of GDIPs and their potential to transform GDEs in semi-arid areas. This study demonstrates the value of integrating remote sensing and interpretable machine learning to support ecological monitoring and targeted invasive species management."

Using 31 million satellite image tiles, we detect nearly one million (996,074) clandestine gravesites over the land surfaces of Zhejiang, Fujian and Guangdong provinces, especially in forests and croplands. Further spatial attribution analysis suggests that the detected mass informal gravesites are closely related to gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, elevation, vegetation cover, climatic factors and the distances to rivers and coastlines. These findings and conclusions may provide meaningful references for gravesite occupied land use monitoring and management at regional to national scales."

 Accurate peanut seedling recognition is essential for quantifying emergence rates, a key phenotyping task in breeding programs for this important global oilseed. This task is challenged by field heterogeneity from morphological variation (genotype, growth stage, planting density) and imaging variability (flight altitude, solar angle). To address this, object-based image analysis (OBIA) and deep learning approaches were evaluated using UAV remote sensing imagery collected under systematically varied field conditions. An enhanced framework, P-YOLOv11s, was developed for UAV-based peanut seedling detection, incorporating a P2 layer for fine-scale features, an asymptotic feature pyramid network for multi-scale fusion, and an iEMA attention mechanism for occlusion robustness. The experimental design encompassed significant agronomic diversity (1025 genotypes, nitrogen regimes, planting years, densities, and eco-zones), developmental stages (three- to six-leaf), and flight configurations (15, 25, 40 m altitudes; four diurnal intervals). P-YOLOv11s demonstrated strong robustness, achieving a mean Average Precision (AP) of 93.5 %, with 62 % fewer false detections than OBIA and a 4.8 % higher AP than other YOLO variants. Flight altitude was the most influential factor, with 15 m yielding the best results. Peak accuracy (99.4 %) occurred at the four- to five-leaf stage, while solar angle had a minimal effect (<1.7 % variation). The framework achieved subplot-level precision (μ = 0.42 plants), addressing the challenge of accurate field-based phenotyping under real-world constraints."

 Industrial heat sources are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, environmental degradation, and energy transitions, yet systematic global monitoring has been hindered by fragmented and sector-specific datasets.

Correlation analysis further shows that economic development, population, and development stage strongly shape the spatial distribution of industrial activity. In addition, the dataset captures short-term disruptions, such as reduced activity during the COVID-19 pandemic.

 Efficient detection of anomalous artificial surfaces is vital after disasters to support rapid emergency response. This study proposes a novel, training-free texture index method to accurately identify damaged artificial surfaces using post-disaster imagery. The method was tested across diverse disaster sites, including earthquake-affected areas in Turkey (Sites A–C), and tsunami- and tornado-damaged regions in Palu and Joplin (Sites D–I), covering a range of surface types and building structures. Sites A–C were chosen to develop and assess the efficacy of the proposed texture index method. Primarily, the three-dimensional texture features (3DTF) comprised of Contrast, Gabor wavelets, and secondary texture extraction (Con_Gabor), were amalgamated with a K-means classifier to delineate post-disaster artificial surface areas without prior knowledge. Given the discernible texture discrepancies between normal and anomalous artificial surfaces post-disaster, Homogeneity and Entropy texture features derived from Worldview-3 images at each site were leveraged to construct the artificial surface anomaly index (ASAI) for automatically extracting anomalous artificial surfaces. The findings demonstrated high overall accuracies of detecting anomaly artificial surfaces, ranging from 90.07 % to 91.76 % in Sites A–C. Notably, the ASAI outperformed Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and the U-Net model. The overall accuracy (OA) of the ASAI method is 10 %–20 % higher than that of the U-Net model, showing superior automatic performance without necessitating training samples. Furthermore, the effectiveness of ASAI was validated in the Palu and Joplin sites, affirming its utility across diverse disaster scenarios. The damages of steel-tiled houses, middle-level houses and roads were effectively identified as anomaly artificial surfaces. The overall accuracies of the ASAI for identifying anomaly artificial surfaces were 89.55 %–92.5 %. These findings indicate the identification anomaly artificial surface using the ASAI was robust in different types of anomaly artificial surface caused by different disaster. The method of using ASAI to automatically identify anomaly artificial surfaces in post-disaster and single-temporal images has the potential for wide applicability."

 Chongming Island of Shanghai, the largest estuarine alluvial island of China, has been kept seaward expanding due to continuous riverine sediment deposits and extensive land reclamation. Moreover, the island is highly vulnerable to long-term ground deformations and rising sea levels. To evaluate the influence of coastal ground deformation on flood risk, we investigated long-term ground deformation on Chongming Island over the last decade using RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1A satellite datasets collected from 2012 to 2023. The independently achieved ground deformation time series, representing the projection of ground displacement along the radar line of sight (LOS) direction (recovered using traditional multi-temporal interferometric SAR algorithms), were then jointly combined. The results show that the eastern region of Chongming Island has been experiencing significant ground subsidence over the last decade, with a maximum amplitude exceeding 20 mm/year. The significant ground subsidence in the eastern island occurred at a rate at least 2.5 times that of the concurrent sea level rise (SLR).Furthermore, we analyzed the coastal flood risk on Chongming Island under the comprehensive effects of local ground subsidence, SLR, and storm surges. To this aim, a hydrodynamic model was applied to simulate various inundation scenarios on Chongming Island after failures of different seawall sections. As the major outcome of our work, under the simulated scenario (e.g., the worst case), the total flood inundation area in 2042 was estimated to exceed 50% of the island. Under this worst scenario, almost all of the salt marsh vegetation in Chongming Dongtan Nature Reserve would be flooded after the relative SLR. The loss of elevation in the low-lying island further aggravates the coastal flooding risk. Therefore, preserving the stability of eastern and northern seawalls is essential to the security of Chongming Island in the context of the increasing flooding risk in the low-lying river estuary."

This study investigates phenological variability and monthly trends across Europe from 1982 to 2022 using the high-accuracy PKU GIMMS NDVI dataset, which offers improved temporal consistency and calibration. We present a novel framework integrating established analytical methods with a newly developed Phenology Variability Index (PVI), designed to assess phenological stability at climatic scales. The framework combines spatially explicit pixel-level analyses, including interdecadal NDVI statistics and PVI evaluations, with clustering methods to identify phenologically homogeneous regions, quantify their variability, and enable inter-cluster comparisons. Following preprocessing and quality control, monthly NDVI series were analysed using non-parametric statistical tests, K-means clustering, Land Surface Phenology (LSP) metrics, and monthly trend estimation. Five spatially coherent clusters were identified, displaying distinct seasonal signatures across ecological zones. Results reveal spatially heterogeneous trends, including consistent greening in temperate, montane, and Mediterranean regions, weaker seasonal greening in semi-arid areas, and largely stable winter NDVI in mountainous forests and continental areas. LSP metrics indicate shifts in the timing and duration of growing seasons, consistent with climate- and land use- driven phenological change. The PVI further highlights higher phenological stability in Mediterranean landscapes and semi-arid regions and greater variability in montane forests and temperate zones. This integrated approach enhances understanding of vegetation responses to environmental variability across scales and provides a robust methodological basis for long-term ecosystem monitoring, supporting both applied geoinformation analyses and broader ecological research."

 Monitoring Earth’s dynamic systems benefits from high spatial and temporal resolution imagery, a combination rarely available from a single sensor. This study addresses the novel challenge of cross-platform super-resolution (SR), aiming to enhance high-frequency satellite data with high-resolution aerial data. We employed a diffusion-based deep learning model, Super-Resolution via Iterative Refinement (SR3), to upscale 3-m Planet satellite imagery to the 60-cm resolution of the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) images, a fivefold enhancement. The findings reveal that the “domain gap” between aerial and satellite data is a significant obstacle. While the model performed robustly on single-source data (peak signal-to-noise-ratio, or PSNR, of 27.28 dB), its cross-platform performance was substantially lower (best PSNR of 16.85 dB). Interestingly, models trained from scratch consistently outperformed fine-tuned models, suggesting negative transfer due to the differences between the aerial and satellite data sources. Furthermore, environmental metrics like the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) proved to be more effective performance indicators than standard computer vision metrics (such as PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM), showing better preservation of critical spectral information for vegetation analysis.

 The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) is a critical parameter for measuring the vegetation photosynthetic capacity. The Hi-resolution Global LAnd Surface Satellite (Hi-GLASS) FAPAR product (version 1, V1) from Landsat imagery has been successfully applied to the ecosystem productivity modeling; however, this product algorithm still exhibits some limitations, including the poor adaptability to heterogeneous surfaces and limited physical interpretability, due to the absence of real-world knowledge guidance. To address these issues, we integrated deep transfer learning and radiative transfer models to update the Hi-GLASS FAPAR algorithm and generate the corresponding product (i.e., version 2, V2). A long short-term memory (LSTM) model was pre-trained on Soil-Leaf-Canopy (SLC) simulations and then optimized using physical knowledge-guided transfer learning, which was used to generate the new FAPAR product from Landsat image series. Validation results demonstrated that the Hi-GLASS FAPAR V2 (R2 = 0. 95, RMSE = 0.08) significantly outperformed V1 (R2 = 0.94, RMSE = 0.11), with notable improvements in various vegetation categories and sensors. The greatest improvement of FAPAR was found over multiple forest types, where different forest categories showed substantial gains, with R2 increasing by 2 % − 11 % and RMSE decreasing by 15 % − 55 %, confirming the improved adaptability of our proposed method to heterogeneous canopies. Moreover, the Hi-GLASS V2 product preserved better spatial details than MODIS、GLASS、GEOV2 products, and its temporal dynamics were more closely aligned with field measurements than the V1 product. These advancements highlight the potential of Hi-GLASS FAPAR V2 as valuable data for supporting terrestrial ecosystem studies."

Schroeder,Geographically weighted regression model-assisted (GWRMA) estimation to improve precision of estimates combining remote sensing and ground plot data,"•Incorporating spatial heterogeneity into model-assisted estimator improves precision. •Geographically Weighted Regression Model Assisted (GWRMA) estimator is proposed. •GWRMA precision gain over conventional model-assisted estimators can be substantial. •GWRMA advantage increases with larger sample size and greater spatial heterogeneity. •Typical model-assisted variance estimator severely underestimates GWRMA variance. 
 Remotely sensed data play a vital role providing auxiliary variables that can improve precision of sample-based estimates without incurring the substantial cost of increasing sample size. In the setting of design-based inference, model-assisted estimators using generalized regression models provide a practical option to exploit such auxiliary variables to obtain estimates with smaller uncertainties than the Horvitz-Thompson (HT) estimator. Spatial heterogeneity is one of the main characteristics of spatial geographical populations and spatial nonstationarity in regression model parameters can greatly impact model predictions. However, model-assisted estimators typically do not incorporate spatial heterogeneity in the assisting models, and this may result in failing to gain the full precision improvement available from model-assisted estimation. Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) offers a practical way to incorporate spatial heterogeneity of the data into the model. In this study, we substantiate the benefit of employing a GWR model-assisted estimator (GWRMA) in which GWR is used as a linking model between the response and auxiliary variables. The illustrative example we use to demonstrate the precision enhancing capacity of GWRMA is estimating tree volume in forest inventory monitoring. The performance of GWRMA was compared with the HT estimator and a linear regression model-assisted (LRMA) estimator when both the response and auxiliary variables are continuous. Several factors potentially impacting the estimators and their precision were investigated using Monte-Carlo simulation applied to populations constructed to represent different levels of spatial heterogeneity and correlation between the response and auxiliary variables. Because both LRMA and GWRMA estimators are asymptotically unbiased, variance is the key criterion for comparing the estimators. For the constructed populations with spatial heterogeneity, the GWRMA estimator achieved standard errors smaller than the HT and LRMA estimators, and the improvement in precision increased with increasing sample size. The precision advantage of the GWRMA estimator relative to the LRMA estimator was attributable to the capacity of the GWRMA estimator to adapt to spatial variation in the regression model leading to better local prediction of the target variable. The conventional model-assisted variance estimator substantially underestimated the variance of the GWRMA estimator. An alternative variance estimator based on averaging the GWRMA and LRMA variance estimates avoided the severe underestimation of the conventional model-assisted variance estimator. This average variance estimator yielded confidence intervals that exceeded the nominal 90% coverage but still had shorter length than the 90 % confidence intervals from LRMA estimator. Further exploration of variance estimators for the GWRMA estimator is a necessary next step to improve utility of the GWRMA estimator."

 Semantic image synthesis (SIS) is essential for remote sensing, particularly in generating high-quality training data for scarce annotated datasets. While existing SIS methods have advanced pixel-wise mappings between semantic maps and images, they often overlook spatial priors, such as relationships between geographic objects (e.g., road-building adjacency), leading to structural inconsistencies in synthesized images. To address this, we propose the graph-prior diffusion transformer (GDiT) for semantically controllable remote sensing image synthesis. We first convert semantic maps into semantic graphs, encoding geographic objects as nodes with structured spatial interactions. To capture spatial and semantic relationships, we propose the Geometric-Semantic Aware Module (GSAM), which integrates CLIP-extracted semantics and geometric attributes for a more context-aware representation. Furthermore, we design the Graph Diffusion Transformer (GDiT) Block, which employs graph-to-image cross-attention to refine spatial structures, ensuring topological coherence and semantic fidelity in synthesized images. Experiments on the landcover and landuse dataset show that GDiT achieves competitive performance by incorporating text prompts to enable multilevel control across global, object and pixel dimensions, generating high-fidelity images while using only 38.9% of the parameters compared to GeoSynth, significantly improving efficiency and accuracy.

 Road extraction plays a crucial role in automatically identifying road networks from remote sensing images, which is essential for various applications. However, existing road extraction methods perform poorly when dealing with dense roads. Inspired by the act of ”weaving” in real life, this paper proposes a dense road extraction method named WeavingUnet, aimed at addressing the difficulties in effectively extracting dense roads using existing methods. This model explores a novel approach to road feature extraction by analyzing road features in various directions and simulating the geometric shapes of roads to more accurately perform dense road extraction. The model incorporates innovative components such as Snake Weaving Attention, Contextual Information Weaving Module, Global Information Extraction Module, and Multi-Scale Weaving Decoder, which collectively enhance the extraction of multi-level road information and optimize the road reconstruction process. The model is tested on the public datasets DeepGlobe and Massachusetts, achieving F1 scores of 82.73% and 72.52%, and IoUs of 71.44% and 61.01%, respectively. Compared with the latest SOTA models, the F1 scores increase by 1.53% and 1.22%, and the IoUs improve by 1.76% and 1.87%. This study also conducts a comprehensive analysis of dense road extraction and compared it with SOTA models. In the densest areas, the false negative rates (FNs) in the test images are reduced by 4.93‰ and 1.47‰, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of WeavingUnet in handling dense roads.

 A majorty of the low-lying coastal areas worldwide, where the population is densely concentrated, are confronted with high to extremetly high risks of land subsidence. However, a comprehensive detection and quantification of large-scale coastal subsidence patterns and their primary drivers in eastern China remain lacking. In this study, we employed Time Series Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (TS-InSAR) technique and Sentinel-1 data to derive the vertical deformation pattern at a resolution of 90 m from 2017 to 2024. We developed a novel multi-frame mosaicking method, achieving spatially consistent InSAR observations over the land-sea transition areas. Our findings uncover extensive coastal subsidence in northeastern Shandong and eastern Jiangsu, highlighting several rapid-subsidence funnels with rates exceeding 50 mm/yr for the first time. By integrating Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery, subsidence time series, groundwater level measurements, and principal component analysis (PCA), we further analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution patterns and underlying drivers of these heterogeneous subsidence funnels. Our analysis demonstrates that anthropogenic factors are the dominant drivers of coastal subsidence. Four representative case studies reveal distinct subsidence mechanisms: (1) brine extraction for salt production and aquaculture, (2) excessive freshwater withdrawal for agricultural irrigation and industrial use, (3) groundwater depletion for intensive greenhouse aquaculture, and (4) land reclamation for industrial infrastructure development. In each region, subsidence patterns are predominantly controlled by a single dominant factor. This study is expected to provide valuable insights for monitoring and managing coastal subsidence, enhance our understanding of associated risks, and offer critical guidance for protecting communities in vulnerable coastal areas."

 Surface observations are crucial for understanding atmospheric pollutant sources and variability. However, interpreting these observations, particularly when comparing them to chemical transport model (CTM) simulations, remains challenging. A key difficulty is the spatial mismatch between model resolutions and the point measurements from surface stations. To mitigate this issue, we developed a deep learning (DL)-based method to quantify systematic discrepancies between surface carbon monoxide (CO) observations and GEOS-Chem model simulations across China during 2015–2022. Our method generated daily correction factors for adjusting modeled CO concentrations. Validation demonstrated good consistency between the observed-to-modeled (Obs/GC) concentration ratios and the derived correction factors, with correlation coefficients (R) ranging from 0.85 to 0.93. Our analysis reveals broadly uniform negative correlations between correction factors and observed CO concentrations across eastern China, suggesting that systematic discrepancies decrease with increasing local emissions. In contrast, positive correlations prevail in western China. Furthermore, significant temporal variability in systematic discrepancies was identified at seasonal scales, emphasizing the need for time-dependent dynamic corrections. Applying the DL-based correction approach to GEOS-Chem-simulated surface CO concentrations for 2015–2022 led to a significant improvement in model-observation agreement: R values increased from 0.30–0.43 to 0.63–0.70 (spatial consistency) and from 0.15–0.49 to 0.62–0.81 (temporal consistency). This work provides a novel data-driven approach for correcting systematic discrepancies in model/observation comparisons, which is important for more accurate interpretation of surface observations."

 Particulate matter (PM) significantly impacts urban air quality and public health, making the quantification of its source contributions crucial for effective air quality management. In this work, we investigate the origins of organic aerosol (OA) and elemental carbon (EC) in an urban environment by synthesizing results from in situ observational analyses (receptor modeling) and chemical transport modeling. This study focused on the city of Barcelona, Spain, during a summer and a winter period in 2019, using measurement data from an aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM), an Aethalometer, and analyses of filter samples along with source-resolved predictions from the chemical transport model (CTM) PMCAMx. Results refer to PM1 (PM finer than 1 μm). Oxygenated OA (OOA) was the dominant source of OA during both periods with contributions ranging from 63 % of PM1 OA in winter to 80 % in summer. During summer, most of it originated from sources outside Barcelona such as wildfires, biogenic sources, as well as sources outside Europe. PMCAMx significantly underpredicted OOA during wintertime, suggesting that the model is lacking both processes that produce secondary OA (SOA) during periods of low photochemical activity and the corresponding emissions of organic pollutants. Biomass burning OA (BBOA) emitted far away from the city and its conversion to SOA either due to nighttime or aqueous chemistry could explain part of the missing OOA. Hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA) ranged from 8 to 14 % of the OA in both periods, peaking during morning and evening rush hours. The primary OA (POA) emissions from transportation during winter may be underestimated in the emission inventory. Cooking OA (COA) was also a significant source (11 % of total PM1 OA) and it needs to be added to the current European emission inventories. Fresh BBOA was a small component of OA during summer and higher during winter. The PM1 EC levels were found to be dominated by local sources during both seasons. Among these sources, fossil fuel combustion was the most important contributor, accounting for approximately 74 % of the total EC. This highlights the strong influence of traffic and other fossil fuel-related activities on EC concentrations in Barcelona, regardless of season.This study demonstrates the value of integrating observational data (and receptor modelling) with chemical transport modeling to more accurately identify the sources of carbonaceous PM in urban environments. Such combined approaches are essential for developing effective mitigation strategies tailored to seasonal and local emission patterns, ultimately supporting improved air quality management."

 Since the Industrial Revolution, human activities have significantly increased atmospheric black carbon (BC) aerosols, harming air quality, human health, and regional climate. Although the research on the characteristics and sources of atmospheric BC has expanded, understanding of its cross-sea transport remain limited. Zhanjiang city, located on the coast of the northern South China Sea, experiences pronounced monsoon influences and has heavy industries. However, this region maintains good air quality. We hypothesize that monsoon circulation may significantly influence BC pollution. To verify this hypothesis, aerosol samples were continuously collected in Zhanjiang from 2018 to 2019. Results showed clearly seasonal variations in BC concentration and its carbon isotopic values, indicating they are not primarily influenced by local emission sources, as local emissions remain relatively constant. Instead, lower values in summer and higher values in other seasons align closely with monsoon transitions, suggesting that a significant role of monsoon circulation in driving these variations. Backward trajectory model (HYSPLIT) and the potential source contribution factor analysis model (PSCF) further revealed distinctly different air mass pathways between summer (ocean air masses) and other seasons (terrestrial air masses). A Bayesian mixing model indicated that the combustion of fossil fuels (58 %, including 30 % of liquid fuel and 28 % of coal) is the predominant source of BC entering Zhanjiang with air masses. Correlation analyses with water-soluble inorganic ions revealed that BC exhibited significantly weaker associations with terrestrial pollution compared to TC, due to substantial contributions from secondary aerosols to TC during long-range transport. This study suggested that monsoon-driven circulation plays a critical role in aerosol transport and composition in the coastal region, providing new insights into atmosphere–ocean carbon exchange."

 Wildfire smoke is an increasingly important contributor to urban air pollution and public health risk, especially in ozone (O3) non-attainment areas like Chicago. This study assessed the impact of the 2023 wildfire smoke on ground-level O3 concentrations and associated mortality across Chicago's 77 community areas. We integrated NOAA's Hazard Mapping System smoke classifications, high-resolution downscaled O3 data, and GridMET meteorological data to construct a daily community-level dataset for 2014–2023. We estimated counterfactual O3 levels in the absence of wildfire smoke using matching, linear regression, and machine learning models. We separated the effect of smoke on O3 from those caused by meteorological variability. O3 concentrations increased with smoke density, peaking under medium smoke conditions, while the largest smoke-attributable increase (6.7 ppb) occurred under heavy smoke. Estimated daily all-cause mortality rates attributable to smoke-enhanced O3 followed a similar trend, reaching 0.24 deaths per 100,000 population per day under heavy smoke. Spatial analysis revealed that central, western, and southeastern communities experienced the greatest exposure and health burden, suggesting non-linear interactions between transported smoke and local pollution.

 This study examines the separate roles of emissions and climate on the future evolution of high European ozone events in atmosphere-only simulations of UKESM1 (United Kingdom Earth System Model version 1). These include the historical simulation (ending in 2014), the reference scenario ssp370SST (2014–2099) – with steady increases in near-surface temperature, global population and atmospheric methane concentrations – and several variations thereof. For this purpose, we have identified local ozone extremes, connected them into large episodes (spatiotemporal aggregates with a minimum duration of three days) and calculated the episode sizes as the accumulated areal extents during their life cycles. Despite decreases in precursor emissions over most of Europe under ssp370SST, the number of local extremes and the sizes of ozone episodes would increase across the continent throughout the 21st century because of soaring methane levels. The southeast of Europe and Turkey could experience even larger increases due to rising regional emissions. Mitigation strategies targeting emissions of regional precursors, global methane and, more importantly, the combination of both would effectively decrease ozone pollution below present-day values. On the other hand, climate warming enhances biogenic emissions, reduces dry deposition fluxes and increases atmospheric humidity. Overall, this leads to moderate increases in the occurrence of local ozone extremes, but with some remarkable regional differences and a negligible impact on the sizes of ozone episodes when averaged over the whole continent. Moreover, as future ozone episodes become more common under ssp370SST, the associated circulation anomalies are expected to weaken in the future."

 Abrupt or intermittent emissions can significantly increase regional pollutants and dominate short-term variations, but previous simulations usually treated emissions through total amounts and allocation coefficients, making it difficult to effectively characterize their concentration variation features at the minute-scale. This study proposes a rapid simulation framework for minute-scale high-resolution emission modeling under such scenarios. Integrating multisource background emissions, it assessed Hefei Airport impacts (December 2023). Evaluations confirm accurate simulation of meteorological/air pollutant spatial distributions and effective capture of minute-scale emission characteristics. Airport emissions moderately intensified near-surface temperature inversion downwind of Hefei. Near-airport monthly mean NO2 and NO rose by 4 μg/m3 and 9 μg/m3, respectively. Emissions also impacted a 15 km radius, elevating NO2 by 0.6–1.8 μg/m3 and NO by 0–2.5 μg/m3.

 Estimation of accurate CO2 fluxes remains challenging because of limited high-quality data and inaccuracies in atmospheric chemistry-transport models (ACTMs). While satellite observations of total-columns (XCO2) have improved global data coverage, integration of co-located CO2 observations from multiple platforms and consistent methodologies are yet to be fully developed for altitude-wise model evaluations. In our study, we used MIROC4-ACTM simulations, surface and aircraft observations (ATom, Amazon, and CONTRAIL projects - considered as ground truth), and Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) XCO2 covering 2015–2021. MIROC4-ACTM and ATom profiles show mean differences of −0.1 ± 0.48 and 0.01 ± 0.3 ppm over land and ocean, respectively (p < 0.05), and those are −0.34 ± 1.07 and −0.2 ± 0.51 ppm for OCO-2 XCO2 sampled at ATom profile locations. Height-wise analysis shows that CO2 differences are concentrated in the lower troposphere (0–2 km), where model simulation are strongly influenced by surface fluxes. In Amazon, MIROC4-ACTM inversion does not have CO2 observation sites and limited vertical coverage of aircraft profiles right above the forest canopy (∼0.15 km) to 4.4 km, leading to poor ACTM–OCO-2 (−0.88 ± 1.02 ppm) and ACTM-aircraft (−0.105 ± 2.58 ppm) agreements mainly due to lower troposphere. Over the airports in Asian megacities (i.e., emission hotspots), the model shows a higher difference with CONTRAIL (−1.06 ± 0.58 ppm) than OCO-2 (−0.15 ± 0.53 ppm). The larger ACTM–CONTRAIL difference reflects ACTM's coarse resolution (approx. 2.8° × 2.8°), which limits its ability to resolve smaller scale urban fossil fuel emissions, while the smaller ACTM–OCO-2 difference likely also results from OCO-2's limited sensitivity below the boundary layer."

 Ozone (O3) pollution poses a critical air quality challenge in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), particularly under typhoon peripheral circulation. However, the vertical processes governing O3 persistence remain poorly understood. This study investigates a persistent O3 pollution episode in July 2023 using the WRF-Chem model, data assimilation, and the GBA O3 Lidar Network. Results reveal pronounced city-specific differences in O3 persistence mechanisms. In Macao, extended O3 exceedance was driven by persistent typhoon-induced subsidence, suppressed boundary-layer mixing, and convergence of transported O3-rich air masses, forming a regional O3 pool. Conversely, Shenzhen experienced rapid O3 dissipation due to the inflow of cleaner maritime masses. Lidar observations captured distinct O3 stratification within boundary layer under the influence of typhoon subsidence.

Seasonal patterns were found where wet seasons were dominated by biogenic compounds from natural sources while dry seasons showed increased fire-related pollutants. These findings reveal how emissions, fires and long-range transport affect atmospheric chemistry, with implications for climate models. 
 The Amazon rainforest plays a crucial role in the global climate system, hydrological cycle, and earth's energy balance. As one of the planet's least industrialized regions, it allows investigation of organic aerosol formation and constituents under almost pristine conditions. Nevertheless, human activities are known to affect this ecosystem – especially during the dry seasons. In this study, ambient aerosol samples collected at the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO) during two dry and two wet seasons were characterized by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS). Comprehensive non-targeted data evaluation was applied to identify thousands of molecular formulae. Most were found to be associated with oxidation products of isoprene and monoterpenes, highlighting the predominance of biogenic secondary organic aerosols (SOA) at ATTO. The chemical composition exhibited distinct seasonal patterns with more processed organic compounds during the dry season, which can be explained by an increase of later-generation oxidation products due to reduced wet deposition and enhanced long-range transport. Mono- and polycyclic heteroaromatic components from biomass burning (BB) sources were enhanced during the dry seasons and the second wet season. The wet seasons were generally characterized by less oxidized compounds, associated with freshly formed SOA particles. Height-resolved measurements showed biogenic emissions with higher concentrations of early terpene oxidation products at lower altitudes. Overall, our results provide new insights into the molecular characteristics and seasonality of organic particulate matter at ATTO, helping to constrain the sources and interactions of aerosols, clouds, and precipitation in the Amazon rainforest."

We present a large dataset of high-quality measurements of sulfur dioxide gas and fine aerosol particulate matter collected during ongoing series of eruptions in Iceland. We revealed rapid, localized changes in pollutant concentrations at ground level, with implications for assessing population exposure during volcanic eruptions. 
 The 2021 Fagradalsfjall eruption marked the first in a series of ongoing eruptions in a densely populated region of Iceland (>260 000 residents within 50 km distance). This eruption was monitored by an exceptionally dense regulatory air quality network, providing a unique opportunity to examine fine-scale dispersion patterns of volcanic air pollutants (SO2, PM1, PM2.5, PM10) in populated areas.Despite its relatively small size, the eruption led to statistically-significant increases in PM and SO2 concentrations at distances of at least 300 km. Peak daily-mean concentrations of PM1 (measured in the capital area, 25–35 km distance from the source) rose from 5–6 to 18–20 µg m−3, and the proportion of PM1 within PM10 increased by ∼50 %. In areas with low background pollution, average PM10 and PM2.5 levels increased by ∼50 % but in places with high background sources, the eruption's impact was not detectable. These findings suggest that ash-poor eruptions are a major source of PM1 in Iceland and potentially in other regions exposed to volcanic emissions.Air quality guidelines for PM1 and SO2 were exceeded more frequently during the eruption than under background conditions. This suggests the potential for an increase in adverse health effects. Moreover, pollutant concentrations exhibited strong fine-scale temporal (≤1 h) and spatial (<1 km) variability. This suggests disparities in population exposures to volcanic air pollution, even from relatively distal sources, and underscores the importance of a dense monitoring network and effective public communication."

These suggest that the eruption could have a non-negligible influence on regional surface climate, and we discuss the mechanisms via which such an influence could occur but also highlight that the forcing is relatively weak compared to natural climate variability which significantly hinders the detection of such impacts in the real world. 
 Injection of sulfur and water vapour by the Hunga volcanic eruption significantly altered chemical composition and radiative budget of the stratosphere. Yet, whether the eruption could also affect surface climate, especially via indirect pathways, remains poorly understood. Here we investigate these effects using large ensembles of simulations with the CESM2(WACCM6) Earth system model, incorporating interactive chemistry and aerosols in both coupled ocean and atmosphere-only configurations.We find some statistically significant extratropical regional climate responses to the eruption driven by circulation changes; these are partially linked to the modulation of El Niño–Southern Oscillation, and its associated teleconnections, and to perturbations of the stratospheric polar vortex in both hemispheres. The stratospheric anomalies affect surface climate through modulating the North Atlantic Oscillation in the Northern Hemisphere (up to three boreal winters following the eruption) and the Southern Annular Mode in the Southern Hemisphere in late 2023. The latter is partly related to a concurrent reduction in Antarctic ozone, as increased stratospheric aerosols and water vapor reach the polar vortex.Our study suggests that the eruption could have had a non-negligible influence on regional surface climate, and discusses the mechanisms via which such an influence could occur. However, the results also highlight that this forcing is relatively weak compared to interannual variability, and is subject to model uncertainties in the representation of key processes. More research is thus needed before definitive statements on the role of the eruption in contributing to surface climate and weather events in the following years are made."

This work directly observed the core-shell structure and water uptake behavior of individual submicron aerosol particles at an urban site and elucidated the potential impact on particle reactive uptake and heterogeneous reactions. 
 Determining the particle chemical morphology is crucial for unraveling reactive uptake in atmospheric multiphase and heterogeneous chemistry. However, it remains challenging due to the complexity and inhomogeneity of aerosol particles. Using a scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) coupled with near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy and an environmental cell, we imaged and quantified the chemical morphology and hygroscopic behavior of individual submicron urban aerosol particles. Results show that internally mixed particles composed of organic carbon and inorganic matter (OCIn) dominated the particle population (73.1±7.4 %). At 86 % relative humidity, 41.6 % of the particles took up water, with OCIn particles constituting 76.8 % of these hygroscopic particles. Most particles exhibited a core-shell structure under both dry and humid conditions, with an inorganic core and an organic shell. Our findings provide direct observational evidence of the core-shell structure and water uptake behavior of typical urban aerosols, which underscore the importance of incorporating the core-shell structure into models for predicting the reactive uptake coefficient of heterogeneous reactions."

Pandey;Adeyemi A. Adebiyi,Dust semi-direct effects: low-level cloud response to free-tropospheric dust-induced longwave radiation over the North Atlantic Ocean,"Mineral dust absorbs solar and terrestrial radiation, modifying the environment where clouds exist. When above low-level clouds, dust often increases cloud cover due to shortwave absorption. Using satellite data over the North Atlantic Ocean, we show that longwave absorption by dust reduces cloud-top cooling and weakens the increase in low-level cloud. Our results highlight the importance of accurately representing longwave effects of dust in model assessments of aerosol-climate interactions. 
 Aerosol semi-direct effect is the adjustment of the radiative budget due to the cloud response to radiation absorption. Although dust accounts for about a third of aerosols' shortwave absorption, our understanding of its semi-direct effect often relies on traditional shortwave-focused mechanisms previously established for biomass-burning aerosols, and implications of dust longwave absorption on clouds have yet to be explored. Here, we assess the low-level cloud cover (LLCC) response to changes in properties and characteristics of the free-tropospheric dust layer over the North Atlantic Ocean (May–August, 2007–2017). We find that, consistent with previous studies, LLCC typically responds positively (increases in clouds) to an overlying dust layer. However, this response weakens with increasing dust optical depth (DOD), dust geometric thickness (DGT), and dust-layer base height (DBH). Specifically, we find that the LLCC response weakens by 4.3 ± 1.04 % and 1.6 ± 0.65 %, respectively, for a one-standard-deviation increase in DOD and DGT, and a smaller response to DBH (0.19 ± 0.45 %). We also find that the weakened LLCC response is primarily due to enhanced dust-induced longwave-dominated cloud-top warming, which counteracts the mean cloud-top cooling by as much as 19 % (mean of 9 %). Sensitivity analysis further indicates that the variability in dust properties, influenced by dust size distribution and refractive index, dominates the changes in dust-induced cloud-top warming, rather than variabilities in cloud properties or thermodynamic profiles. Our result adds to the traditional understanding of LLCC enhancement through shortwave-driven atmospheric stability, often associated with aerosol semi-direct effects, and highlights the role of dust-induced cloud-top longwave warming in dust semi-direct effects."

Hasekamp,Uncertainty in aerosol effective radiative forcing from anthropogenic and natural aerosol parameters in ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3,"Aerosols (small airborne particles) impact Earth's climate, but their extent is unknown. By running climate model simulations and using machine learning to emulate millions of additional variants with different settings, we found that natural emissions like sea spray and sulfur are key sources of uncertainty in climate predictions. Our work shows that understanding these natural processes better can help improve climate models and make future climate projections more accurate. 
 Interactions between aerosols, clouds, and radiation remain a major source of uncertainty in effective radiative forcing (ERF), limiting the accuracy of climate projections. This study aims to quantify parametric uncertainties in aerosol–cloud and aerosol–radiation interactions using a perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE) of 221 simulations with the ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3 climate model, varying 23 aerosol-related parameters that control emissions, removal, chemistry, and microphysics.The resulting global mean aerosol ERF is −1.24 W m−2 (5–95 percentile: −1.56 to −0.89 W m−2). Uncertainty in ERF is dominated by sulfate-related processes, biomass burning, aerosol size, and natural emissions. For aerosol-cloud interactions, dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and biomass burning emissions are key drivers, whereas sulfate chemistry and dry deposition exert the strongest influence on aerosol-radiation interactions. Structural uncertainty is difficult to characterize, and this study focuses primarily on evaluating parametric uncertainty. The leading sources of ERF parametric uncertainty identified here are consistent with those found in other PPE studies, highlighting common sensitivities across climate models.Comparison with POLDER-3/PARASOL satellite retrievals reveals persistent model biases in aerosol optical depth (AOD), Ångström exponent (AE), and single-scattering albedo (SSA), many of which fall within the parametric uncertainty range. Sulfate-related processes account for over 40 % of AOD uncertainty, while AE and SSA are most sensitive to DMS, sea salt, and black carbon parameters. Correlation analysis between key parameters and observables indicates that several biases may be reduced by tuning through physically consistent parameter adjustments for bias reduction. Our results highlight the need for combined efforts in parameter optimization and structural model development to improve confidence in aerosol-forcing estimates and future climate projections."

This study looks at how two key factors – how much smoke is emitted & how high it rises – affect how smoke spreads. Using data from a major 2008 Siberian wildfire, four models were tested. Results show that models often inject smoke too low & remove it too quickly, missing high-altitude smoke seen by satellites. Better estimates of smoke height and removal are crucial to improve air quality forecasts. 
 The near-source and downwind impacts of smoke aerosols depend on both emitted mass and injection height. This study examines aerosol dispersion sensitivity to these factors using four global models from the AeroCom Phase III Biomass Burning Emission and Injection Height (BBEIH) experiment. Each model performed four simulations: BASE, using burned-area-based BB emissions GFED4.1s with default injection heights; BBIH, using monthly MISR plume injection heights; BBEM, using fire- radiative-power-based BB emission FEERv1.0; and NOBB, excluding BB emissions. The focus is the April 2008 Siberian wildfire event. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) varies across models. In BASE, all models show a steeper AOD decline from the source to downwind regions than satellite data, indicating inadequate long-range transport or excessive aerosol removal in all models. Moreover, near-source, most models overestimate aerosol extinction below 2 km, suggesting injection heights are too low. In BBIH, MISR plume injection heights slightly improve vertical aerosol distribution, but the magnitude is too small. In BBEM, AOD increases significantly near the source due to enhanced BB emissions; however, the downwind AOD remains largely underestimated in both BBIH and BBEM. Notably, CALIOP lidar reveals aerosol layers above 6 km from source to downwind regions – features absent in all model simulations, although a high bias in the gridded CALIOP data makes the evaluation inconclusive. These results suggest that monthly MISR plume injection heights and enhanced BB emissions alone are insufficient to resolve the model–observation discrepancies. Injecting smoke at higher altitudes in Siberia and reducing aerosol wet removal warrant further investigation."

Positive Matrix Factorization analyses were conducted on the corresponding 11-year dataset, which determined ten PM sources. Temporal evolution of these sources is investigated, highlighting a strong downward trend of anthropogenic sources over 11 years. 
 The identification of particulate matter (PM) sources and the quantification of their contribution to the urban environment is a necessary input for policymakers to reduce the air pollution impacts. The association between the PM sources and the oxidative potential (OP) is also a key indicator for evaluating the ability of PM sources to induce in-vivo oxidative stress and lead to adverse health effects, which becomes an emerging metric in the Directive on ambient air quality (22024/2881/EU). Most studies in Europe have focused on PM and OP sources in the short term, for only 1 or 2 years. However, the efficiency of reduction policies, trends, and epidemiological impacts cannot be properly evaluated with such short-term studies due to a lack of statistical robustness. Here, long-term PM10 filter sampling at the Grenoble (France) urban background supersite and detailed chemical analyses were used to investigate decadal trends of the main PM sources and related OP metrics. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analyses were conducted on the corresponding 11-year dataset (January 2013 to May 2023, n=1570), enlightening the contributions of 10 PM sources: mineral dust, sulfate-rich, primary traffic, biomass burning, primary biogenic, nitrate-rich, MSA-rich, aged sea salt, industrial and chloride-rich. The stability of the chemical profile of these sources was validated by comparison with the profiles retrieved from shorter-term (3 years) successive PMF analyses. A Seasonal-Trend using LOESS decomposition was then applied to evaluate the trends of these PM10 sources, which revealed a substantial decrease in PM10 (−0.73 µgm-3yr-1) as well as that of many of the PM10 sources. Specifically, negative trends for primary traffic and biomass burning sources are detected, with a reduction of 0.30 and 0.11 µgm-3yr-1, respectively. The OP PM10 source apportionment in 11 years confirmed the high redox activity of the anthropogenic sources, including biomass burning, industrial, and primary traffic. Eventually, downward trends were also observed for OPAA and OPDTT, mainly driven by the reduction of residential heating and transport emissions, respectively."

Statistically significant trends are emerging, including increasing infrared radiation due to a warming atmosphere, and decreasing solar radiation due to increasing liquid water content in clouds. These trends are influenced by large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns and by atmospheric rivers. 
 Arctic amplification manifests as a pervasive warming trend emerging over the past century in near-surface air temperature throughout the Arctic that is double the globally averaged temperature increase throughout most of the year. It results from complex processes involving oceanic, atmospheric and terrestrial components which require detailed study to discern roles of the fundamental processes involved to improve predictions of the Arctic environment. We report on signals that are beginning to emerge, on a timescale predicted by recent satellite remote sensing studies, from the unique 25 year record of detailed surface-based radiometer measurements obtained by the US Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Facility North Slope of Alaska (NSA) site at Utqiaġvik, Alaska. Statistically significant warming trends are found at the site in the boreal fall, while a decrease in net radiation occurs in late summer. This decrease is driven primarily by the decrease in shortwave radiation resulting from increasing cloud liquid water path as observed by the microwave radiometer. The magnitude of the liquid water path trends is slightly larger than the root mean square error (RMSE) due to natural variability, while the magnitude of the net radiation trends is smaller than the RMSE natural variability, emphasizing that these signals are only just emerging. Analysis of prevailing meteorological regimes linking NSA with the Arctic Ocean and subarctic latitudes, and atmospheric rivers, suggests that specific changing circulation patterns are the primary driver for these summertime trends."

We present an algorithm which uses observations of the Flexible Combined Imager (FCI) to estimate the total column of WV (TCWV) over sun-lit, clear-sky pixels. FCI is a satellite instrument, and every 10 min it takes an image which covers Europe, Africa, and the Atlantic with a resolution of 1 km. Such high-resolution WV fields will provide valuable information for weather forecasters and researchers. 
 A retrieval of total column water vapour (TCWV) from the new daytime, clear-sky near-infrared (NIR) measurements of the Flexible Combined Imager (FCI) onboard the geostationary satellite Meteosat Third Generation Imager (MTG-I, Meteosat-12) is presented. The retrieval algorithm is based on the differential absorption technique, relating TCWV amounts to the radiance ratio of a non-absorbing band at 0.865 µm and a nearby water vapour (WV) absorbing band at 0.914 µm. The sensitivity of the band ratio to WV amount increases towards the surface which means that the whole atmospheric column down to the boundary-layer moisture variability can be observed well.The retrieval framework is based on an optimal estimation (OE) method, providing pixel-based uncertainty estimates. It builds on well-established algorithms for other passive imagers with similar spectral band settings. Transferring knowledge gained in their development onto FCI required new approaches. The absence of additional, adjacent window bands to estimate the surface reflectance within FCI's absorbing channel is mitigated using a principal component regression (PCR) from the bands at 0.51, 0.64, 0.865, 1.61, and 2.25 µm.We utilize synergistic observations from Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) and Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) to generate “FCI-like” measurements. OLCI bands were complemented with SLSTR bands, enabling evaluation of the retrieval's robustness and global performance of the PCR. Furthermore, this enabled algorithm testing under realistic conditions using well-characterized data, at a time when a long-term, fully calibrated FCI Level 1c dataset was not available. We built a forward model for two FCI equivalent OLCI bands at 0.865 and 0.9 µm. A long-term validation of OLCI against a single atmospheric radiation measurement (ARM) reference site without the PCR resulted in a bias of 1.85 kg m−2, centred root-mean-square deviation (cRMSD) of 1.26 kg m−2, and a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.995.A first verification of the OLCI/SLSTR “FCI-like” TCWV against well-established ground-based TCWV products concludes with a wet bias between 0.33–2.84 kg m−2, a cRMSD between 1.46–2.21 kg m−2, and r between 0.98–0.99. In this set of comparisons, only land pixels were considered. Furthermore, a dataset of FCI Level 1c observations with a preliminary calibration was processed. The TCWV processed for these FCI measurements aligns well with reanalysis TCWV and collocated OLCI/SLSTR TCWV but shows a dry bias. A more rigorous validation and assessment will be done once a longer record of FCI data is available.TCWV observations derived from geostationary satellite measurements enhance monitoring of WV distributions and associated meteorological phenomena from synoptic scales down to local scales. Such observations are of special interest for the advancement of nowcasting techniques and numerical weather prediction (NWP) accuracy as well as process-studies."

The study spans over 15 years and provides detailed information on European CH4 emission trends and seasonality, using in-situ data, including Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) network. Our results highlight the importance of improving details in the inversion setup, such as the treatment of lateral boundary conditions to narrow the uncertainty ranges further. 
 Atmospheric inversions are widely used to evaluate and improve inventories of methane (CH4) emissions across scales from global to local, combining observations with atmospheric transport models. This study uses the dense network of in situ stations of the Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) to explore how well in situ data can constrain European CH4 emissions. Following the concept of inter-comparison studies of the atmospheric tracer transport model inter-comparison Project (TransCom), a CH4 inverse inter-comparison modeling study has been performed, focusing on Europe for the period 2006–2018. The aim is to investigate the capability of inverse models to deliver consistent flux estimates at the national scale and evaluate trends in emission inventories, using a detailed dataset of CH4 emissions described and presented here for first time.Study participants were asked to perform inverse modelling computations using a common database of a priori CH4 emissions and in-situ observations as specified in a protocol. The participants submitted their best estimates of CH4 emissions for the 27 European Union (EU-27) member states, the United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Norway. Results were collected from 9 different inverse modelling systems, using 7 different global and regional transport models. The range of outcomes allows us to assess posterior emission uncertainty, accounting for transport model uncertainty and inversion design decisions, including a priori emission and model-data mismatch uncertainty.This paper presents inversion results covering 15 years, that are used to investigate the seasonality and trends of CH4 emissions. The different inversion systems show a range of a posteriori emission adjustments, pointing to factors that should receive further attention in the design of inversions such as optimising background mole fractions. Most inverse models increase the seasonal cycle amplitude, by up to 400 Gg month−1, with the largest adjustments to the a priori emissions in Western and Eastern Europe. This might be due to underestimation of emissions from wetlands during summer or the importance of seasonality in other microbial sources, such as landfills and waste water treatment plants. In Northern Europe, absolute flux adjustments are comparatively small, which could imply that the emission magnitude is relatively well captured by the a priori, though the lower station density could contribute also.Across Europe, the inverse models yield a similar decreasing trend in CH4 emissions compared to the a priori emissions (−12.3 % instead of −9.1 %) from 2006 to 2018. While both the a priori and the a posteriori trend for the EU-27 are statistically significant from zero, their difference is not. On a subregional scale, the differences between a posteriori and a priori trends are more statistically significant over regions with more in-situ measurement sites, such as over Western and Southern Europe.Uncertainties in the a priori anthropogenic emissions, such as in the agriculture sector (cows, manure), or waste sector (microbial CH4 emissions), but also in the a priori natural emissions, e.g. wetlands, might be responsible for the discrepancies between the a priori and a posteriori emission shift in the trends in Western,  Eastern and Southern Europe.Our results highlight the importance of improving the inversion setup, such as the treatment of lateral boundary conditions and the model representation of measurement sites, to narrow the uncertainty ranges further.

Such measurements are key inputs for models that estimate how much ice is stored on the whole mountain range scale and for models that predict how this ice reserve will change in future, and what impact this will have on water supply for the large populations living downstream. 
 Mountain glaciers provide an important service in sustaining river flows for large populations downstream of High Mountain Asia (HMA) but these glaciers are retreating and the future of this water resource is highly uncertain. Glacier thickness measurements are vital for accurate mapping of the remaining ice reserve and for predicting where and how fast it will decline under climate change, but such measurements are severely lacking in this region due to the difficulties of surveying in remote, high-altitude settings. We report on a uniquely extensive new thickness dataset for eleven glaciers in the Khumbu Himal around Mount Everest that we collected in late 2019 using a novel, low-frequency helicopter-borne radar. To aid in interpreting the survey radargrams we developed a terrain clutter model, and we succeeded in mapping ice thickness with a precision of around ±7 % and horizontal spacing of around 40 m, for thicknesses of up to 445 m and spanning a total of 119 line-km, approximately doubling the length of previous thickness surveys in HMA. To demonstrate the utility of our new measurements, we compare them to existing modelled thickness products and find that the models struggle to reproduce the distribution of ice in these complex, steep, rapidly slowing, thinning and stagnating glaciers, with widespread systematic thin and thick biases equivalent to around half of the measured ice thickness or more. This new dataset (https://doi.org/10.5285/e39647f5-fb72-4d16-acbd-9784ed2167b8 (Pritchard al., 2025) permits for the first time a detailed analysis of model performance on Himalayan glaciers, a key step in improving model skill and hence the accuracy of modelled thickness distributions and future ice loss on the mountain-range scale."

The method showed high accuracy and rapid response potential regardless of weather and illumination conditions. By overcoming the limits of optical satellite imagery, it offers a powerful tool for timely landslide disaster response, benefiting disaster management and advancing methods for monitoring hazardous terrains. 
 Rapid response to multiple landslide events demands accurate, all-weather, day-and-night detection capabilities. Optical remote sensing has advanced landslide detection but remains limited under adverse weather and lighting conditions. Synthetic Aperture Radar, resilient to these constraints, remains underexplored for automated landslide detection due to challenges such as complex pre-processing and geometric distortions. This study integrates Deep Neural Networks with Sentinel-1 backscatter data for co-seismic landslide detection, utilizing a data-centric approach. We train and test the models using 11 earthquake-induced widespread landslide events, covering ≈ 73 000 landslides across diverse geologic and climatic settings. Inference on unseen events in Haiti (2021) and Sumatra (2022) demonstrates robust transferability, achieving F1-scores up to 82 %. Using explainable artificial intelligence, we highlight the discriminative capability of change detection bands over backscatter alone. Our findings emphasize the potential of SAR-based DNN models for worldwide, generalized, and rapid landslide detection, addressing critical gaps in current methods that solely use optical data. This research lays a foundation for broader applications in automated SAR-based earth surface change detection, particularly in complex, hilly and mountainous terrains."

We sampled SPGW, runoff, and rivers near Simpson Lagoon, Alaska, during spring ice breakup, summer open water, and fall freeze-up seasons. Through incubation experiments, we compared biodegradable DOC (BDOC) across sources and seasons and linked these results with DOM composition using Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). DOM composition was distinctly different between SPGW and rivers and shifted throughout the year. SPGW contained an order of magnitude more dissolved organic carbon (DOC) than rivers, with average concentrations increasing from breakup (22 ± 5 mg C L–1) to freeze-up (110 ± 42 mg C L–1). SPGW also contained three times or more BDOC than rivers, averaging 18 ± 1% during breakup and declining to 3.4 ± 0.7% during freeze-up. BDOC was positively correlated with condensed aromatic and polyphenolic DOM formula classes that are often associated with recalcitrant organic matter. Thus, SPGW DOM is highly aromatic yet biodegradable and is likely an important energy source to Arctic coastal waters in summer when river inputs are low."

Here, we investigate why two widely used chemical mechanisms in the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) predict inconsistent ozone levels and conflicting responses to emission reductions over major city clusters of China. By combining process analysis with an explainable machine learning technique, we reveal that these discrepancies primarily stem from differences in the rates of  ozone-forming and -suppressing reactions involving hydroperoxy (HO2) and organic peroxy (RO2) radicals between the two mechanisms. This thereby underscores the need for a more accurate depiction of volatile organic compounds reactivity in models. We further quantify the impact of these discrepancies by projecting ozone levels across China from 2030 to 2060 under the carbon neutrality emission reduction scenario. Divergences peak in 2030, with the two mechanisms disagreeing on whether ozone mitigation in city clusters is achievable. Over time, their predictions begin to converge. By 2060, both mechanisms agree that nearly the entire Chinese population will experience reduced ozone levels, and support the continued reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions as an effective strategy for curbing ozone pollutions. However, significant differences persist in the magnitude of reductions, with one mechanism projecting greater policy efficacy. Continued efforts are therefore required to further reduce the model uncertainty."

This study demonstrates that dissolved SO2 reacts directly with major biogenic terpenoids (α-pinene, β-pinene, d-limonene, β-caryophyllene, and α-terpineol) in atmospheric condensed phases to form OSs without the need for traditional oxidants. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry confirms product molecular formulas consistent with field measurements. Kinetic experiments reveal that α-pinene reacts with SO2 at a second-order rate constant of 4.0 ± 0.9 M–1 s–1 in a 50 vol % acetonitrile/water mixture, with the rate increasing nonlinearly as water content rises, reaching 12 ± 1 M–1 s–1 at 70 vol % water. pH-dependent experiments suggest that this reaction of α-pinene can occur at rates of 60–80 M–1 s–1 at pH 3–5, typical of cloud and aerosol water. This pathway could substantially contribute to OS formation and improve multiphase model predictions. Given that dissolved SO2 concentrations (∼10–3 M) far exceed those of OH, O3, or NO3 in aqueous phase, this pathway may rival or even surpass established oxidant-based sinks for terpenoids, contributing substantially to OS formation. Incorporating terpenoid + SO2 aqueous chemistry into multiphase models could thus enhance predictions of aerosol composition, particle acidity, and climate-relevant properties."

Nölscher,About the Variability of Tire and Road Wear Marker Components in Air: From Emissions to Atmospheric Deposition,"Particles originating from tire wear and road interactions, tire and road wear particles (TRWP), are an emerging class of nonexhaust emissions with growing environmental concern. Yet, little is known about their atmospheric abundance and variability due to emissions, transport and transformation processes. This study addressed this gap by quantifying six tire additives that serve as markers for the indirect detection of TRWP in complex environmental samples. Using a newly developed analytical workflow based on high-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), we traced three antiozonants, N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N′-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD), N-isopropyl-N′-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (IPPD), and N,N′-diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPPD), their oxidation products (6PPD quinone and IPPD quinone), and the vulcanization accelerator 1,3-diphenylguanidine (DPG) across a wide range of sample types. This single-method framework enabled us to observe marker variabilities, from pristine tire material to abrasion-related emissions from the testbed and road, airborne ultrafine particles (UFPs), and total atmospheric deposition. Marker composition varied strongly with source, emission conditions, and environmental exposure. During abrasion, 6PPD decreased by ∼90%, while 6PPD quinone increased along the emission pathway. In ambient UFP from six Bavarian (Germany) sites, mean 6PPD concentrations ranged from <0.01 to 0.55 ng m–3. In the particulate fraction in total deposition from an urban, semi-industrial site, the ratio of oxygenated and parent PPD varied seasonally, revealing a higher degree of oxidation during summer. 6PPD dominated in the autumn and winter with an average of 6.6 ± 0.91 ng m–2 day–1, while 6PPDq was highest in spring and summer with average concentrations of 5.6 ± 5.91 ng m–2 day–1 and reaching an estimated annual deposition of 1.7 ± 0.5 μg m–2 year–1. By linking source materials to atmospheric samples, this study demonstrated the traceability of TRWP along their emission pathway for the first time and highlighted the importance of accounting for the chemical transformation of dedicated marker components in assessing their environmental fate."

HAPs from Canadian wildfires were estimated to increase lifetime population-weighted cancer inhalation risk by 1-in-1 million (500 excess cancer cases) and noncancer risk by a hazard index (HI) of 0.05 across the domain. The additional risk from HAPs in smoke was predicted to exceed a cancer risk of 100-in-1 million for 1300 people and a HI of 1.0 for 110,000 people, all in Canada. In addition, 360,000 people in Canada were predicted to experience an increase in annual-mean PM2.5 of at least 5 μg m–3. Nearly 63 million people, 76% of which were in the U.S., were predicted to experience an increase in seasonal maximum daily 8 h average ozone greater than 1 ppb.

The health effects are primarily associated with the inhalation of particulate matter (PM), which can lead to oxidative stress through the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological systems. The influence of PM size and gaseous oxidants on the production of ROS in the lung is understudied, as most studies to date have focused on assessing this aspect broadly in fine or coarse PM. In this work, we used a kinetic model of redox chemistry in the lung epithelial lining fluid (KM-SUB-ELF) to study the production of ROS (including hydroxyl radical; •OH) from the inhalation of size-resolved PM (spanning eight size bins between 0.18 and 10 μm), ozone (O3), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at three sites located at different distances from roadways in Toronto. The highest ROS production was found at the site located next to a major highway, with particulate pollutants being the primary contributor. The total ROS production peaked in the PM accumulation mode at all sites (up to 41% associated with submicrometer PM), following closely the size distribution of trace metals, especially Cu. The •OH production was more site-specific; it peaked in the accumulation mode with highway traffic emissions, and in quasi-ultrafine (<0.18 μm) mode in areas with moderate traffic, following the trends of soluble Fe and PM (up to 60% associated with submicron PM). ROS production in the lung was also induced by gaseous oxidants. Ozone played the dominant role, particularly at sites with moderate traffic but high O3 levels where up to 52% of ROS and 14% of •OH produced in the lung were attributed to inhaled O3. The results highlight the importance of traffic emissions, submicrometer PM, and gaseous oxidants in deriving the health effects of air pollutants in urban environments."

We generate a phase space of climate states with different global‐mean surface temperatures and equator‐to‐pole surface temperature contrasts then perturb each with longwave radiative forcing. We find that the state‐dependence of PA is largely a superposition of two effects. Firstly, as a consequence of moist thermodynamics, latent energy transport drives stronger PA in climates with higher global‐mean surface temperatures and stronger meridional surface temperature gradients. On top of this, the ice‐albedo feedback amplifies PA in climates where the climatological ice edge sits within the polar cap."

RDycore shows good performance in capturing fine‐scale flood inundation dynamics against gauge measurements (with a median correlation coefficient of 0.81) and satellite observations. On top of rainfall, snowmelt not only increases the mean maximum inundation depth (12.0%–25.1%), but also expands the total flooded area (19.9%–31.9%) and prolongs the mean flood duration (3.4%–7.1%) across the events.

A turbulent wind boundary layer drives the growth of a pre‐existing narrowband wave field until it breaks, transferring energy into the water column. Under sustained wind forcing, the wave field resumes growth. We separately analyze energy transfers during wave growth and breaking‐induced dissipation. Energy transfers are dominated by pressure input during growth and turbulent dissipation during breaking. Wind input during growth is balanced with dissipation during breaking over an entire growing‐breaking cycle. The wave growth rate scales with u∗/c2 ${\left({u}_{\ast }/c\right)}^{2}$, modulated by the wave steepness due to sheltering, and the energy dissipation follows the inertial scaling with wave slope at breaking, confirming the universality of the process. Following breaking, near‐surface vertical turbulence dissipation profiles scale as z−1 ${z}^{-1}$, with their magnitude controlled by the breaking‐induced dissipation."

Studies were selected based on their use of spatiotemporal models to assess the relationship between environmental factors and CVDs. We evaluated the methodological quality of included studies using the Spatial Methodology Appraisal of Research Tool (SMART). Significant challenges were noted, including the need for higher spatial resolution data sets and improved methods for addressing the modifiable areal and temporal unit problems and ecological bias. Additionally, the visualization of spatiotemporal data remains underutilized and underdeveloped, limiting the practical utility of the findings. We also discuss combining parameters to form an indicator that better represents environmental conditions, as well as cases where ground, satellite, or modeled data products are suitable. These recommendations could extend to other acquired chronic diseases and their relationship with environmental risk factors to improve the utility of spatiotemporal models.

 Across the North Pacific Ocean, the mid-latitude storm track accounts for most of the heat and moisture transport into the Arctic and western North America, considerably influencing regional precipitation and temperature patterns1,2. By the end of this century, the winter North Pacific storm track is projected to shift polewards3–6, with substantial implications for oceanic ecosystems and land-based water availability1,7. Although atmospheric reanalyses suggest a polewards shift of the storm track7–12, the lack of an observed wind record has left it uncertain whether the storm-track shift has occurred in recent decades, and what role climate change plays in determining the storm-track position. Here we derive an observational constraint for mid-latitude storm tracks and show that the winter North Pacific storm track has shifted substantially polewards, emerging from natural variability. A polewards shift of storm track-induced heat and moisture flux is also evident over western North America, implying regional impacts on precipitation and temperature patterns. Our analysis further reveals that climate models underestimate the polewards shift of the storm track in recent decades, suggesting that the future human-induced impacts on both the North Pacific ecosystem and western North America might be larger than in current predictions.

 Tropical forests store about half of the global forest aboveground carbon (AGC)1, yet extensive areas are affected by disturbances, such as deforestation from agricultural expansion2,3 and degradation from fires4, selective logging5, and edge effects6,7. Over time, disturbed forests can recover, gradually restoring carbon stocks and ecological functions8. However, how recovery rates vary with disturbance size, type and location remains poorly quantified. Here we use a bookkeeping approach with spatially explicit vegetation recovery curves to quantify AGC dynamics in disturbed tropical forests during 1990–2020. We find that disturbed tropical dry forests remained carbon neutral, whereas disturbed tropical humid forests experienced a net AGC loss of 15.6 ± 3.7 PgC, primarily driven by small but persistent deforestation clearings. Despite affecting only about 5% of the disturbed area, these small-size (less than 2 ha) deforestation events accounted for about 56% of carbon losses, owing to persistent land-use conversion without forest regrowth. By contrast, large fire-induced carbon losses were offset by the long-term post-fire recovery. Over time, deforestation expanded into humid forests with higher carbon stock density, intensifying AGC losses per unit area. These findings highlight the disproportionate impact of small clearings on tropical carbon losses, suggesting the need to curb land-use changes and protect young and recovering forests.

In this work, the authors suggest minimizing its performance trade-offs via indirect bicarbonate conversion within a porous solid electrolyte reactor. 
 Carbon capture, recovery and conversion are typically done by three separate steps, which notably increases the total energy consumption and capital costs. Here we propose to indirectly convert (bi)carbonates, which are carbon-rich sorbents in alkaline carbon capture, into valuable chemicals in a porous solid electrolyte (PSE) electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) reactor while eliminating the energy-intensive CO2 recovery step. Specifically, direct feeding of (bi)carbonates into the PSE layer while performing CO2RR allows simultaneous CO2 regeneration within the PSE chamber. Impressive electrochemical performance was demonstrated, with up to 96% formate Faradaic efficiency, 95% CO2 recovery efficiency and 86% bicarbonate-to-formate conversion. Reactor versatility allowed us to obtain up to 5.0 M formate, ~50% higher than bicarbonate solubility and C2+ products with 73% selectivity, setting the state of the art for bicarbonate-fed CO2RR. Operating for at least 100 hours at 100 mA cm−2 averaging 82% CO2 recovery and 89% Faradaic efficiencies, our reactor adds economic value to alkaline carbon capture and CO2 conversion, bringing both closer to practical implementation.

 Capturing CO2 directly from ambient air is necessary for managing carbon levels and supporting long-term climate sustainability. However, the slow adsorption and desorption kinetics of current direct air capture sorbents remain a major limitation, whereas faster kinetics allow for quicker CO2 uptake and greater air throughput—both are essential for enhancing system efficiency. In this work, we present a covalent organic framework (COF) with both fast kinetics and high CO2 uptake. The COF (termed COF-1000) exhibited a CO2 capacity of 1.31 mmol g−1 under dry conditions at 400 ppm CO2, reaching half of its capacity within 8.1 min. Under humid conditions (75% relative humidity), water further enhanced both uptake and kinetics, leading to a remarkable CO2 capacity of 2.19 mmol g−1 with a reduced half-capacity time of 6.8 min. The exceptionally fast kinetics observed for COF-1000 were further demonstrated by using outdoor air as the CO2 source, where 50 adsorption–desorption cycles were conducted within 3 days, yielding a CO2 uptake of 22.1 mmol g−1 d−1, a value exceeding the current state-of-the-art materials. These results highlight COF-1000’s potential to enable efficient, scalable direct air capture and promote sustainable carbon mitigation. Direct air capture is a promising technology to mitigate the rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations contributing to climate change. Here a covalent organic framework with high CO2 capacity and cycling stability is reported to be capable of selectively and rapidly removing CO2 from open air."

 Owing to the rapid increase of European heat event occurrences over the past decades, the understanding of their physical drivers has become increasingly important for the scientific community. Recently, it has been shown that cold North Atlantic sea surface temperatures are strongly linked to European heat events such as in summers of 2015 and 2018. Thereby, an accurate representation of this mechanism in climate models is crucial for a more realistic European heat event simulation. Here, we investigate the mechanism by employing seven global coupled climate models, of which six models are embedded in the High Resolution Model Intercomparison Project. Our results show that, compared to the models with low-resolution versions, high-resolution ones simulate a more realistic relationship between North Atlantic sea surface temperatures and European summer temperature extremes. This is attributable to a better reproduction of the North Atlantic trough and the downstream ridge anomalies over central Europe. Improvements in high-resolution ocean configurations reduce the North Atlantic surface biases and improves air-sea interactions, thus having implications for the prediction and projection of climate extremes in the North Atlantic-European region. High-resolution climate models simulate a more realistic relationship between North Atlantic sea surface temperatures and European summer temperature extremes, because of the reduced surface temperature bias in the subpolar North Atlantic."

 In many regions, kelp forests have experienced losses due to ocean warming and other stressors, with negative impacts on ecosystems and fisheries. Detailed maps of kelp canopy extent are needed to understand the drivers of these losses, factors promoting resilience, and vulnerability to climate change. While moderate-resolution satellite data have been used to map kelp canopies over large scales, they often miss small, sparse, or nearshore canopies. We developed a convolutional neural network to map kelp canopy using Planet Dove imagery and created annual 3 m resolution maps from 2017 to 2024 across California. We show that kelp persistence during this post-disturbance period, following a marine heatwave, was positively associated with persistence before the heatwave, cooler sea surface temperatures, shallow habitats, and reduced fragmentation. There was high latitudinal variability in the effect of these drivers on persistence, highlighting the importance of data that capture ecological complexity from local to regional scales.

 Treelines are generally expected to respond to climate warming by shifting to higher elevations. However, significant variations in treeline shifts across different mountain ranges have been observed, and the underlying reasons for these differences remain unclear due to the lack of comprehensive global treeline mapping. This study provides a global analysis of treeline shifts using satellite-derived forest canopy height data at a 30-meter resolution, combined with a model of potential treeline positions based on climatic data. The elevations of both observed and potential treelines were mapped for the years 2000 and 2020, and the elevational shifts in treeline positions were quantified over this period. On a global scale, 42% of observed treelines shifted upslope and 25% downslope. However, these shifts generally lagged behind climate-driven potential treeline elevations. By contrast, the rate of treeline shifts was strongly influenced by anthropogenic disturbances. Fire disturbances contributed to 38% of downslope shifts, and regions with lower overall anthropogenic disturbance had faster upslope shifts of observed treelines and thus consequently smaller lags. These findings emphasize the importance of considering both climatic and anthropogenic factors when assessing treeline dynamics and suggest that historical and ongoing human impacts play a critical role in modulating treeline responses to climate change."

 Building instance segmentation from city-scale point cloud is of great significance to urban planning management, disaster response and recovery, and land resource management. However, due to the complexity of urban scenes and sparse nature of LiDAR data, existing methods are often limited by the problems of obscured building boundaries and incomplete building structures, particularly in densely populated urban areas with diverse architectural styles. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that automatically extracts building instances from airborne LiDAR data and is especially aware of the building structures. The proposed method encompasses two main stages, building points semantic segmentation and individual building extraction. First, we design a point cloud semantic segmentation network, VPBE-Net, that innovatively utilizes voxel-point cloud fused features to efficiently extract building points from large-scale point cloud. Second, building instances are automatically and robustly extracted using a graph-based algorithm SI-DVDC, which comprehensively considers both object-level building structure property and point-level density accessibility. We evaluate the semantic segmentation performance on the DALES and Toronto datasets and the building instance segmentation performance on the UrbanBIS and City-BIS datasets. For the semantics, Overall Accuracy (OA) and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) metrics reach 88.96 % and 70.28 % on DALES dataset, and 89.26% and 75.40% on Toronto dataset, which is 2.22 % and 3.25 % higher than the state-of-the-art methods. For the building instance extraction, the instance-level quality metric reach 88.65 % on UrbanBIS dataset and 76.97 % on City-BIS dataset, respectively. The experiments verify that the proposed method can extract individual buildings from complex urban and rural environments, while being aware of diverse building structures, thereby demonstrating the remarkable generalization ability.

 Landslides represent a major type of earthquake-triggered geohazard, with their dynamic evolution influenced by the complex interaction of postseismic environmental factors. The 2017 Mw 6.4 Nyingchi earthquake triggered numerous landslides, yet research has largely focused on coseismic mapping, and there remains a lack of cataloging and characterization of postseismic landslides accelerated by the earthquake (i.e., Earthquake Accelerated Landslides, EALs). These landslides remain a serious hazard to surrounding communities, with impacts that persist well beyond the earthquake. This study employs Sentinel-1 time-series analysis to reveal the spatial distribution and postseismic deformation mechanisms of EALs. A total of 299 EALs were identified and cataloged, which are primarily distributed in high mountainous regions west of the epicenter and show a distinct linear clustering along active faults. By comparing near-field and far-field EALs, we found that far-field landslides may experience greater acceleration despite weaker ground shaking. Time-series analysis indicated a rise in EAL deformation velocity from 1.56 cm/yr (preseismic) to 5.08 cm/yr (postseismic), reflecting a strong accelerating effect of the earthquake. In addition to the deformation acceleration triggered by the mainshock, postseismic landslide deformation also exhibited seasonality correlated to precipitation and land surface temperature, as well as aftershock-induced variations. Exponential modeling further indicates a decreasing deformation trend of EALs, with stabilization occurring approximately 6.8 years after the mainshock. This research systematically examined landslide evolution after the Nyingchi earthquake, providing a basis for post-earthquake landslide hazard assessment, with particular emphasis on the increased far-field landslide hazards."

 Characterizing the evolution of urban settlements is vital for informed urban planning that mitigates associated risks. Urban development has traditionally been examined in two dimensions using Earth observation: land cover change, monitored through daytime optical remote sensing, and lighting infrastructural change, observed using nighttime remote sensing. However, these two types of change have often been analyzed in isolation, limiting a comprehensive understanding of their combined impacts on urbanization. This study bridges this gap by simultaneously analyzing monthly Black Marble nighttime light (NTL) data and World Settlement Footprint data to compare lighting and urban land cover change in the Mediterranean region. Our findings reveal that 80% of urbanization-associated pixels display either urban land expansion or lighting growth, but not both. Confusion matrix highlights regional variations: commission errors are particularly high in West Asia (74%), indicating increases in nightlights driven by densification or road improvements without corresponding land conversion. Conversely, omission errors are higher in Western Europe (52%) and North Africa (47%), where urban land expansion occurs without observable lighting infrastructure growth, reflecting phenomena such as informal settlement growth, industrial infill, and energy-saving practices. This study enhances our understanding of the urbanization process through satellite observations, emphasizing the need for a more comprehensive monitoring approach that captures the diverse dimensions of urban growth."

We conducted a direct comparison of PACE OCI with Sentinel-3’s multispectral Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI), and its Cyanobacteria Assessment Network (CyAN) operational product using imagery from summer 2024 blooms in Lake Erie, Green Bay, and Clear Lake. We evaluated performance of both sensors using the established Cyanobacteria Index (CICyano) and corresponding cyanobacterial cell density (CCD) to estimate bloom biomass. PACE OCI successfully captured bloom patterns comparable to Sentinel-3 OLCI. When benchmarked against the CyAN product, OCI-derived CCD showed strong agreement (R2 = 0.84, Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) = 8.95%), though a negative bias (β≃11%) was observed for extreme bloom pixels. Validation with in situ measurements indicated that OCI significantly improved chlorophyll-a biomass retrievals compared to CyAN/OLCI (NRMSE = 21.57% for OCI vs 38.67% for CyAN/OLCI), emphasizing the value of hyperspectral observations for optically complex inland waters. Our results demonstrate PACE OCI’s capability to advance CyanoHAB monitoring, providing a critical first step in establishing continuity with existing operational products while offering new potential for improved biomass estimates and taxonomic discrimination."

 Road network information has extensive applications, such as urban planning and navigation. However, current road extraction methods mostly rely on single model architectures and single-source remote sensing images, neglecting the potential benefits of collaborative extraction with heterogeneous networks and multi-source data fusion. Moreover, existing methods often suffer from road fragmentation and poorly connected road graphs due to occlusions. To address these challenges, we propose MT-RoadNet, a local–global joint enhancement framework for extracting road surfaces and centerlines, which incorporates multi-network collaborative optimization. Specifically, MT-RoadNet adopts a dual-branch structure, which not only facilitates the collaborative extraction of local details and global semantics but also achieves the coupling of geometry and topology through a cross-task dynamic interaction mechanism. Besides, we propose the Local–Global Feature Fusion module (LGFF), which dynamically integrates local details and global semantics through multi-level feature interaction. Furthermore, to reduce interference features with high inter-class separability and low intra-class variation, we innovatively design the Visual State Space Module (VSSM) and the Spatial-Channel Mutual Attention (SCMA). The VSSM weighs features dynamically using multi-directional cross-scanning and global receptive fields, emphasizing prominent area information while improving computational efficiency. SCMA effectively guides the model to focus on semantically relevant regions. Finally, MT-RoadNet adopts a dual-path decoder to produce road surfaces and centerlines. Extensive experiments on three road datasets demonstrate that MT-RoadNet significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of road completeness and recognition accuracy of topological structure.

 Accurate daily mapping of 30-m fractional snow cover (FSC) is critical for hydrological modeling and disaster assessment. Frequent cloud cover and satellite revisit cycles create significant data gaps in high-resolution optical imagery (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel-2), hindering the continuous monitoring of rapid snow dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose the Time-series-based Adaptive snow-Fraction Fusion (TAFF) framework for generating seamless daily 30-m FSC over large scales. The core of TAFF is a dual-path fusion strategy that adapts to the physical state of the snowpack. First, a time-series-based snow stability assessment gauges the magnitude of temporal FSC change. This assessment then directs the fusion process: stable snow is processed using time-weighted fusion, while rapidly changing snow is handled by a pixel-level regression. Evaluated over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, TAFF demonstrates robust improvements over established spatiotemporal fusion algorithms, particularly under cloudy conditions. Independent validation against 215 Landsat 8 images yielded strong performance (R2 = 0.76, RMSE = 19.58 %). Further validation against 46 in-situ snow depth stations indicated a high binary classification accuracy of 0.91. As a robust and practical method for large-scale FSC mapping, TAFF shows promise for integrating additional data sources, such as geostationary and microwave sensors, to enhance the high-resolution monitoring of ephemeral snow."

 Accurate estimation of individual tree biomass in urban landscapes is critical for carbon stock assessment and urban forest management but remains challenging because of the structural complexity and species diversity of urban trees. This study presents an integrated methodological framework that combines deep learning-based tree species identification with LiDAR-derived structural parameter estimation to enable rapid and precise biomass mapping at the individual tree level. Using multiplatform LiDAR data (UAV-borne and handheld mobile laser scanning), we developed a lightweight sample generation method derived from side-view tree projections (SVP) to efficiently construct a species-adaptive training library and proposed a novel individual tree identification approach optimized with the YOLOv11 deep learning algorithm. Our framework systematically evaluated the performance of single-source versus fused LiDAR point clouds across three key metrics: species classification accuracy (achieving 87.3 % on independent test data), structural parameter retrieval (R2 = 0.925 for DBH, R2 = 0.844 for height), and biomass estimation fidelity (86.3 % agreement with field measurements). The results demonstrated that compared with single-source alternatives, data fusion reduces parameter estimation errors by 4.8–56.2 %, while the SVP strategy enables computationally efficient species-specific allometric model matching.

 This study examines the role of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in ozone (O3) formation in a medium-sized residential city in South Korea. Using continuous measurements of 53 VOC species and photochemically adjusted initial concentrations (PICs), we assessed VOC transformations and their impact on O3 production. Results show that alkenes, particularly isoprene, cis-2-butene, and propene, are dominant contributors to O3 formation, with their influence intensifying under high O3 conditions. PIC of total VOCs (36.1 ppb) were significantly higher than measured concentrations (8.3 ppb), highlighting the extent of photochemical degradation. Ozone formation potential (OFP) analysis showed that metrics based on consumed VOCs better captured O3 variability than those based on measured concentrations, underscoring the importance of accounting for photochemical processing. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) identified distinct VOC sources: while LPG/natural gas usage (23.3 %) and coal combustion (22.4 %) dominated measured VOCs, solvent usage (16.2 %) and biogenic emissions (25.7 %) contributed more substantially when PICs were considered. Regional transport also played a key role, suggesting that aged and photochemically processed air masses significantly influence downwind O3 levels. These findings demonstrate the need to prioritize the control of anthropogenic alkenes and aromatic compounds, while also considering the influence of biogenic emissions. Policy measures should incorporate photochemical transformations into source attribution frameworks to support more effective and targeted O3 mitigation strategies."

 In the morning of 12 November 2022, severe aircraft icing occurred over Anhui Province, Eastern China during weather modification operations. In-situ airborne measurements revealed the presence of a substantial concentration of supercooled droplets with effective diameter exceeding 45 μm, and liquid water content (LWC) above 1.2 g m−3 during the icing event.Given the importance of microphysical parameterization (MP) scheme for icing conditions, simulations using different multi-moment MP schemes, i.e., WDM6, NSSL, Milbrandt-Yau (MY) schemes, are conducted at 1-km grid spacing for the case. Comparisons against satellite observations indicate that the general evolution of the frontal system and surface precipitation are well reproduced by the simulations. However, all simulations underpredict upper-level clouds with cloud-top temperature below 240 K over the northeastern part of the front. Besides, WDM6 scheme produces ice cloud-top area (CTA) closest to satellite observations but only produces approximately half of the observed CTA for supercooled cloud tops. The Milbrandt-Yau scheme shows superior performance in simulating the cloud top features during the icing event. Examinations of explicit supercooled cloud water (SCW) prediction skills indicate that WDM6 generates excessive total number concentration (Nt) of small SCW, with Nt reaching up to 1011 m−3 and effective diameter (ED) below 20 μm. In contrast, the NSSL scheme produces significantly larger SCW particles but substantially lower Nt at approximately 107 m−3 and ED of above 200 μm. Notably, the particle size distribution of SCW predicted by MY scheme is more realistic compared with in-situ aircraft measurements."

While local impacts on temperature and precipitation are known, the extent and underlying mechanisms of its influence on meteorological drought remain unclear. Here, we analyzed 3696 paired forest loss and intact sites across boreal, temperate, and tropical zones. Forest loss intensified meteorological drought in more than 52% of affected regions. Drought prevalence in boreal zones rose by 5% over 20 years—three times greater than in tropical zones—because of reduced latent heat flux and increased surface albedo, which together suppressed convective rainfall. In contrast, tropical forests demonstrated greater ecological resilience, mitigating ~40% of meteorological drought intensification. Notably, forest loss–induced meteorological drought may further evolve into more severe agricultural and hydrological droughts. Therefore, we recommend implementing strategies tailored for each climate zone, including native forest conservation, proactive ecological restoration, and connectivity enhancement, to effectively reduce drought risk."

Here, by using a state-of-the-art atmospheric reanalysis spanning the past seven decades, we show that, in many parts of the terrestrial Arctic, the frequency of extreme weather events has increased sharply. We found pronounced spatial variability in bioclimatic extremes during the past 30 years, including more droughts in the high-Arctic and greater area affected by winter-warming and rain-on-snow events, especially in the European Arctic region. Across one-third of the Arctic domain, such extreme events have only recently begun to occur. Thus, the Arctic is entering a novel era of bioclimatic extremes with likely severe consequences on cold ecosystems."

Because of its sensitivity to oxygen, wildfire was traditionally assumed to control oxygen levels by limiting terrestrial vegetation; however, this feedback is nullified by high moisture levels in tropical ecosystems. Using vegetation modeling, we show that where oxygen-fire effects are dampened by high moisture, photorespiration becomes more effective through increased temperatures. Together, these processes interact to drive an 86% reduction in modeled global biomass when oxygen levels reach 35%. This coregulation imposes substantially tighter control of atmospheric oxygen than wildfire alone, providing previously unknown insights into the spatial and interactive feedbacks that may explain the remarkable stability of oxygen levels since the evolution of forests."

Using an innovative method capable of detecting plastic particles as small as 200 nanometers, we quantified MPs and NPs in aerosols, dry and wet deposition, and resuspension in two Chinese megacities, Guangzhou and Xi’an. Airborne concentrations reached 1.8 × 105MPs per cubic meter and 5.0 × 104NPs per cubic meter in Guangzhou and 1.4 × 105MPs per cubic meter and 3.0 × 104NPs per cubic meter in Xi’an. Estimates revealed a variation of two to five orders of magnitude in MP and NP fluxes across major atmospheric compartments, dominated by road dust resuspension and rainfall-driven wet precipitation. Plastic particles were more heterogeneously mixed in deposition samples than in aerosols and resuspension, indicating enhanced aggregation and removal.

Welton,"Long-term trends in daytime cirrus cloud radiative effects: analyzing twenty years of Micropulse Lidar Network measurements at Greenbelt, Maryland in eastern North America","Over the past twenty years, continuous lidar observations at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center have assessed the radiative impact of cirrus clouds on the Earth–atmosphere system. Findings show these clouds increasingly trap heat as surface reflectivity drops with less snow and ice, contributing to local warming. Continued cirrus monitoring is crucial to refine climate forecasts and support effective climate action. 
 This study analyzes a 20-year dataset (2003–2022) to understand long-term trends in radiative effects and optical properties of cirrus clouds. The research was conducted at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, USA, the primary location of the Micropulse Lidar Network (MPLNET) project. Analysis of net cloud radiative effects (CREs) at both the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) and surface (SFC) reveals decreases in radiative flux by −0.019 and −0.037 W m−2 yr−1 and −0.031 and −0.068 W m−2 yr−1, respectively, based on constrained solutions for lidar-derived 523/527/532 nm extinction coefficient (m−1) solved for lidar ratios bounded by 20 and 30 sr. Currently,  key cloud properties such as boundary temperature and altitude, as well as integrated optical depth, remained stable with only minor seasonal changes. This study also uncovers a persistent decline in surface albedo, with a derived trend of −0.00036 yr−1. We further find that the interrelationship between CRE and surface albedo variation intensifies notably during winter months. This leads to speculation that a decrease in the number of days of snow and ice is the main driver of the decrease in surface albedo. The observed trends show a complex relationship between albedo, radiative flux, and climate, highlighting the need for continued monitoring due to their significant impact on future climate and weather patterns.  We further quantify trend uncertainty with block-bootstrapped 95 % confidence intervals and evaluate sensitivity to solar zenith angle (SZA), finding that TOA trend magnitudes are partially explained by increasing SZA while surface trends remain robust."

At regional scale, we show that over the Indian Ocean, high cloud fractions increase when the Tropical Easterly Jet is active. At a smaller scale, we observe for the first time from space differences in the wind profiles within the cloud and its surrounding clear sky, that can be imputed to convective motions. 
 Model based studies have shown interactions between wind vertical profiles and cloudiness, but few observational studies corroborate them. The unique observations of Aeolus spaceborne Doppler wind lidar can contribute to fill this gap. In this paper, we merged global Aeolus observations of cloud profiles at full horizontal resolution (3 km along orbit track) with co-located profiles of horizontal winds.We first observed wind-cloud interactions at regional scale over the Indian Ocean. Aeolus captures the strengthening of the Tropical Easterly Jet in early June 2020, with wind speeds exceeding 40 m s−1 in its core, and a simultaneous increase of high cloud fraction up to above 30 %, until the decay of the jet during fall.Secondly, we observed wind-cloud interactions at cloud scale (between 3–100 km) in different regions. Over the Indian Ocean as well as over cumulus and stratocumulus dominated regions, we found that the wind shear inside clouds is smaller than the wind shear in the clear sky surrounding the clouds (statistically significant). In addition, we found that the wind speed difference between the cloud and its surrounding clear sky increases with the clear sky wind shear, especially in cumulus (R=-0.94) and stratocumulus (R=-0.87) dominated regions. This study demonstrated that despite its coarse resolution, Aeolus can capture wind perturbations induced by convective motion."

Turner,Simulating out-of-sample atmospheric  transport to enable flux inversions,"We developed a generalized emulator of atmospheric transport (FootNet v3) trained over the United States, enabling the emulation of both surface & column-averaged footprints at kilometer-scale resolution. We demonstrate that FootNet v3 generalizes to previously unseen regions and meteorological conditions, enabling accurate out-of-sample simulation of atmospheric transport. Flux inversion case studies show that FootNet matches or exceeds the performance of full-physics models in unseen regions. 
 Accurately estimating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from atmospheric observations requires resolving the upwind influence of measurements via atmospheric transport and dispersion models. However, the computational demands of physics-based models limit the scalability of flux inversions, particularly for dense in situ and satellite-based observations. Here, we present FootNet v3, a deep-learning emulator of atmospheric transport based on a U-Net++ architecture, which improves generalization and inversion fidelity over prior U-Net-based models.  FootNet v3 is trained on 500 000 footprint examples across the contiguous United States. It predicts surface and column-averaged source-receptor relationships at kilometer-scale resolution and operates 650 × faster than traditional Lagrangian models. Critically, FootNet learns the underlying physical relationship between meteorology and atmospheric transport.  We show that it produces consistent source-receptor relationships when driven by GFS meteorology, even though it was trained with HRRR inputs. FootNet generalizes to unseen regions and meteorological regimes, enabling accurate flux inversions in domains withheld during training. Case studies using GHG measurements in the San Francisco Bay Area and Barnett Shale show that FootNet matches or exceeds the performance of physics-based models when used in a flux inversion and evaluated against independent GHG observations. This is achieved despite FootNet having never seen meteorological inputs from Northern California or North Texas. Feature importance testing identifies physically meaningful drivers that are consistent across both surface and column models. These findings show that machine learning models can learn the underlying physical relationships governing atmospheric transport, allowing them to extrapolate to out-of-sample scenarios and support real-time, high-resolution GHG flux estimation in novel domains without the need for retraining or precomputed footprint libraries."

Newly implemented SF6 chemistry enables stratospheric transport studies. Results agree with satellite observations. The derived lifetimes of six trace gases agree with the literature, but SF6 shows larger sensitivity to the choice of meteorology. The lifetime of SF6 ranges from 1900 to 2600 years. 
 In this work, sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), which is often used as a tracer for stratospheric transport due to its inertness in the stratosphere and nearly linear growth rate in the troposphere, is included in the chemistry transport model (CTM) of the Belgian Assimilation System for Chemical ObsErvations (BASCOE). Sink and recovery reactions for this species are implemented in the model, which has a top in the mesosphere at 0.01 hPa. The simulated SF6 distributions are compared with MIPAS and ACE-FTS observations and the global atmospheric lifetime is computed from CTM runs driven by three recent meteorological reanalyses: ERA5, MERRA2 and JRA-3Q. The results show that BASCOE SF6 profiles are generally within 10 % of the satellite observations below 10 hPa, although discrepancies increase at higher altitudes. The global atmospheric lifetime is used as an additional diagnostic for the implementation of the chemistry in the mesosphere, where satellite measurements are unavailable. The derived SF6 lifetimes are 2646 years with ERA5, 1909 years with MERRA2 and 2147 years with JRA-3Q, in accordance with recent literature. Due to the large spread of published lifetimes for SF6, the study is extended to N2O, CH4, CFC-11, CFC-12 and HCFC-22, to validate the SF6 results. The lifetimes for these species are in agreement with previously reported values, and their spread between simulations is smaller compared to SF6. This analysis highlights the sensitivity of SF6 to the input reanalysis data sets and thus to differences in dynamics."

The atmospheric complexity arises from intricate coupling effects between I2O5 and diverse chemical species. We performed Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics to elucidate the I2O5 hydrolysis mechanisms mediated by prevalent chemicals at the air-water interface. The proposed heterogeneous reactions provides molecular-level insight into the role of I2O5 in the atmospheric iodine chemistry. 
 Higher-order iodine oxides are intricately linked to marine aerosol formation; however, the underlying physicochemical mechanisms remain poorly constrained, particularly for I2O5, which is stable yet conspicuously absent in the atmosphere. While reactivity with water has been implicated, the direct hydrolysis of I2O5 (I2O5+ H2O → 2HIO3) fails to account for this discrepancy due to its high activation barrier (21.8 kcal mol−1). Herein, we have probed heterogeneous hydrolysis of I2O5 mediated by prevalent chemicals over oceans through Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics and well-tempered metadynamics simulations. Our results demonstrate that self-catalyzed pathways involving I2O5 and its hydrolysis product HIO3 substantially reduce the reaction barrier, thereby accelerating the conversion of I2O5 to HIO3 in pristine marine environments. In polluted regions, interfacial hydrolysis of I2O5 mediated by acidic or basic pollutants (e.g., H2SO4 or amines) proceeds with even greater efficiency, characterized by remarkably low barriers (≤ 1.3 kcal mol−1). Collectively, these proposed heterogeneous reactions of I2O5 are relatively effective, acting as a hitherto unrecognized sink for I2O5 and a source of HIO3 – processes that facilitate marine aerosol growth and rationalize the high iodate abundances detected in aerosols. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the elusive I2O5-to-HIO3 conversion, offering an unheeded step toward improving the representation of iodine chemistry and marine aerosol formation in atmospheric models, with implications for climate prediction and environmental impact assessment."

This development is a part of a decade-long program at University of Tennessee to refine the understanding of maize agriculture in locations outside the conventional realm of perfect sites. The focus is on small farms in complex terrain, such as dominating most of Africa and much of eastern North America. Experience has resulted in a need for detailed CO₂/H₂O gradients below canopy level. 
 The canopy storage of CO2, latent heat, and sensible heat within agricultural crops has not yet been fully examined, particularly on small farms situated in complex terrain. Reported canopy storage terms are consistently smaller than those found in forest ecosystems, such that they are often neglected. Our multiport profile system has been developed to examine these storage terms. The system sequentially samples air from four heights to a single non-dispersive Infrared Gas Analyzer (IRGA). Following laboratory testing, the system has been field proven in an east Tennessee maize crop in 2023. The new system enables quantifications of CO2, latent and sensible heat atmospheric storage terms and, with supporting temperature measurements, allows improved examination of the surface heat energy budget and the net air-surface exchange of CO2. It offers a valuable tool for a better understanding of gas-energy fluxes on small farms on topographically varied landscapes."

We encourage using the open Library as a foundation for further spectral analysis and modelling and we support future soil health assessments via spectroscopy. 
 The rise in demand for soil data and information calls for quick and cost-effective methodologies to quantify soil properties. This is particularly important in the realm of restoring soil health in Europe. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has demonstrated the ability to predict specific soil properties with high accuracy whilst being less costly and time-consuming than traditional methods. To fill gaps in national spectroscopic soil data, we compiled the first Austrian NIR soil spectral library (680–2500 nm) based on legacy samples (n=2129), covering all environmental zones of Austria. We then employed partial least square regression (PLSR) modelling to test the usability of the dataset for soil health assessments at its current stage. Our analysis revealed that the application of the PLSR is not suitable for accurately estimating soil health indicators compared to routine laboratory analysis. Nevertheless, among the 14 soil properties tested, total nitrogen, CaCO3, soil organic carbon and clay exhibited moderate predictive accuracy (R2>0.7). Most importantly, the dataset containing sample meta-data (e.g., land use type, environmental zone or zip code), laboratory reference values and NIR spectra with 1 nm resolution can be used as a foundation for further spectral analysis and modelling. We make this work openly accessible to actively contribute to closing soil data gaps and promote the expansion of soil spectral libraries as a basis for soil health assessments (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15772618, Fohrafellner et al., 2025)."

This dataset helps improve understanding of forest growth, carbon storage, and sustainable management. 
 Natural and planted forests differ substantially in ecological functions and economic values, with forest age serving as a key indicator of their developmental and carbon dynamics. However, existing global forest age datasets remain constrained by coarse spatial resolution and the lack of explicit forest type distinction. In this study, we developed a 30 m global forest age dataset for 1985–2024 by integrating Landsat time-series data with the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm on the Google Earth Engine platform, thereby reducing reliance on ground-based forest inventory data. Building upon global forest distribution products, forest age was estimated from change points in long-term spectral trajectories, distinguishing the age of natural and planted forests at a global scale. Validation using 6,100 globally stratified samples demonstrated strong agreement with visually interpreted references (overall accuracy = 0.72, RMSE = 5.66 years), with higher accuracy for natural forests (0.73) than for planted forests (0.70). Globally, pronounced regional contrasts were observed: old-growth native forests (NF) dominate in Europe (84.38 %), South America (82.61 %), and North America (80.62 %), whereas Australia exhibits a bimodal age distribution driven by both old and regenerating stands. Planted forests (PF), by contrast, are consistently younger, with the youngest plantations concentrated in Australia (Age1–5: 65.77 %) and the most mature in Europe (Age36–40: 53.99 %).

Compared to simulations driven by global inventories, CINEI demonstrated better numerical modeling performance in ozone and its precursors (nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide). This study provides valuable insights for designing ozone mitigation strategies. 
 Despite ongoing efforts to reduce pollution, persistent ozone pollution in China remains a public health concern. To better understand the causes of ozone pollution in China and to assess and evaluate the effectiveness of past, current, and planned targeted pollution control strategies, estimates of the amounts of pollutants emitted from various sources are needed. To this end, we have developed harmonized and integrated anthropogenic emission inventories for China, incorporating information from the existing national inventory for mainland China (MEIC) and three global inventories (CEDS, CAMS, HTAP) to cover areas outside of China. The newly developed China INtegrated Emission Inventory (CINEI) includes emissions in China from sectors currently omitted from the MEIC (ships, aviation, waste, and agriculture) that we incorporate from the global inventories. To ensure harmonized emissions data, we performed mapping between different inventories, a process used to achieve consistency between sectors, spatial resolution, and speciation of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs). These harmonized and integrated inventories for China were used to drive WRF-Chem simulations for January (winter) and July 2017 (summer). Through a detailed evaluation of model results against available observations, we show that while the direct use of global inventories alone can lead to severe over- or underestimation of pollutant mixing ratios, CINEI inventories perform satisfactorily in simulating ozone (12 % in summer and 43 % in winter normalized mean bias) and its precursors, including nitrogen dioxide (NO2, −0.5 % in summer and 40 % in winter) and carbon monoxide (CO, −50 % in both seasons). Based on the comparison and modeling of this study, valuable insights into the spatio-temporal variability of ozone and the subsequent design of future ozone mitigation strategies in China were provided."

This study presents the first development of a parameterisation of blowing snow for a global climate model. Simulations avec evaluated using measurements in Antarctica. Results show an overall decrease of the snow accumulation in the escarpment region of the ice sheet due to snow erosion and an increase at the coast due to blowing snow deposition and increase in precipitation. 
 Recent regional model findings suggest that the aeolian erosion of surface snow is a significant contribution to the overall Antarctic surface mass balance (SMB) through ice crystals sublimation and export outside of the ice sheet. Such findings raise the question of the relevance of accounting for such a process also in global climate models. This study presents the development of an intermediate-complexity parameterisation of blowing snow for the ICOLMDZ atmospheric general circulation model, the atmospheric component of the IPSL Coupled Model. The parameterisation is designed to be a trade-off between physical complexity and applicability in a general circulation model, with constraints on numerical cost and stability. The parameterisation is evaluated with in situ observations using limited-area simulations over Adélie Land. The model exhibits satisfactory results in terms of summer wind speed, temperature and intensity of blowing snow fluxes. In winter, blowing snow intensity and occurrences are overestimated close to the coast, concurring with a positive wind speed bias. In terms of blowing snow occurrences throughout the year, ICOLMDZ exhibits comparable performance with the regional atmospheric model MAR. Boundary-layer moistening and cooling as well as changes in surface radiative fluxes due to blowing snow crystals are also quantified in the simulations. Global simulations at standard global climate model resolution are carried out to investigate how the Antarctic SMB is modified with the activation of the blowing snow parameterisation. Results show an overall decrease of the net snow accumulation in the escarpment region due to surface snow erosion and an increase along the coast due to blowing snow deposition and increase in precipitation."

However, the formation risk of iodinated disinfection byproducts (I-DBPs) during these processes has long been overlooked. At pH = 3.0–9.0, I-DBPs including iodophenols and triiodomethane were formed in the ultraviolet (UV)/IO4–/phenol system, and the total iodine concentration in I-DBPs ranged from 4.8 to 451.3 nM. In this system, the conversion of IO4– to hypoiodous acid (HOI) proceeded in two stages: (1) a rapid HOI generation phase, where IO4– first transformed into an iodine-containing intermediate followed by its subsequent transformation to HOI, and (2) a slow HOI generation phase, where iodate (the primary product of IO4–) was photoreduced to HOI. The established kinetic model successfully simulated the two-phase formation of HOI. Treatments of the simulated source water samples with hydroxylamine, hydrogen peroxide, Mn2+, Fe2+, nanoscale zerovalent iron, UV, and vacuum ultraviolet (VUV)-activated IO4– processes all resulted in the formation of I-DBPs. The fact that the iodine source of these I-DBPs was IO4– confirmed the self-supplying iodine mechanism of IO4–. Future research should develop technologies that efficiently degrade micropollutants while minimizing I-DBP formation."

Australia offers a unique context to address this bias with its vast arid and semiarid regions, highly weathered, nutrient-poor soils, fire-adapted ecosystems, ancient stable geology, and distinct biota. We present a continental-scale analysis of environmental predictors of soil Hg concentrations based on 2,396 samples from 1,141 catchments spanning 5.84 million km2 (∼76% of Australia). Using boosted regression trees and random forest models, we identified an index of ferrosols as the strongest predictor of Hg concentrations, particularly in the temperate forests of southeastern Australia. Other positively associated factors included loss on ignition (a proxy for soil organic matter), soil nitrogen, leaf area index, and nickel and lead concentrations, while soil electrical conductivity and water availability were negatively associated. We generated a robust, high-resolution (0.005° × 0.005°) national Hg distribution map using spatially explicit random forest models. Unlike patterns observed elsewhere, Hg concentrations in Australia are higher in ferrosols and relatively nitrogen-rich soils than in podosols and oxisols. Our findings highlight the need to address regional gaps in Hg research and emphasize the limitations of relying on regionally specific data sets that do not characterize global patterns."

Freeman,CO2 Sorption in Moisture Swing Anion Exchange Resins for Direct Air Capture: Experimental Isotherm Determination and Modeling,"Moisture swing (MS) sorption is a promising direct air capture (DAC) technology to achieve negative CO2 emissions and counter global warming. In this study, MS CO2 sorption in a model MS sorbent, IRA900, was investigated. IRA900 is a macroporous commercial strong-base anion exchange resin (AER) with quaternary ammonium functional groups. A rigorous CO2 desorption process was developed to desorb all CO2 from the sample and obtain CO2 sorption isotherms as a function of relative humidity, CO2 partial pressure, and temperature. CO2 sorption increased with decreasing relative humidity, decreasing temperature, and increasing CO2 partial pressure. Remarkably, the total CO2 uptake from the sorption isotherms matched the ion exchange capacity (IEC) of the material, suggesting a stoichiometry of one CO2 molecule reacting per active site. An isotherm model for CO2 sorption starting with empty sorption sites (i.e., with the AER in the OH– form) described the experimental data well, supporting the hypothesis that the bicarbonate-loaded AER fully unloaded to the OH– state following rigorous CO2 desorption. CO2 sorption kinetics were studied, and carbon diffusion coefficients were estimated as a function of %RH and CO2 partial pressure. Overall, this study provides a roadmap for the systematic evaluation of MS CO2 DAC materials."

However, PAA may react with halides (Br–, I–) in water to form hypohalous acids, which can contribute to halogenated disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation. Meanwhile, coexisting hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can reduce HOBr/HOI back to halides. To assess and mitigate the DBP risks of PAA in halide-containing waters, this study investigated the oxidant change and DBP formation in PAA/halide/NOM systems. A refined kinetic model accurately simulates PAA/Br– and PAA/Br–/NOM reactions, revealing that a small fraction of NOM is highly reactive with HOBr and drives brominated DBP formation. Dibromoacetic acid dominated the identified DBPs, while total organic bromine (TOBr) analysis suggested a majority of the unidentified byproducts. In PAA/I– and PAA/I–/NOM reactions, newly determined rate constants enabled good model and experimental data agreement. With NOM, total organic iodine (TOI) formation was the dominant iodide sink, with limited iodate formation. Triiodomethane and triiodoacetic acid were the major identified DBPs, along with more unidentified byproducts. Some unknown iodine reactive species were observed to persist in PAA/I–/NOM systems for hours. Importantly, applying a PAA/H2O2 molar ratio of 1:2 substantially mitigated DBP formation, decreasing known Br- or I-DBPs by 85–90% and the TOBr/TOI by 33–44%."

However, previous studies targeted on air quality improvement, focused on one of the two impacts independently of the other and fail to consider both health and ecological losses. This study establishes a dynamic multicity and multisector modeling framework by integrating emission inventories, future mitigation pathways, response surface models, and monetization methods of health and ecological benefits. Taking the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) in China as a case, we quantify the integrated benefits of air pollution control and propose coordinated emission reduction strategies of multiple species aiming at maximizing integrated benefits. Results show that from 2013 to 2020, emission reductions lowered annual economic losses by 709.5 billion CNY, with ecological benefits accounting for nearly half of health benefits. NH3 and NOx reductions were found to be particularly effective in achieving integrated benefits nowadays, with an optimal reduction ratio of approximately 0.75 across the YRD, and stronger NH3 mitigation needed in northeastern regions. Carbon neutrality pathways combined with targeted NH3 and VOCs controls yield greater equity, especially benefiting less-developed areas. On-road vehicles and agriculture are identified as key sectors for achieving overall health and ecological benefits. These findings provide a replicable model for multipollutant, multiobjective air quality management in rapidly industrializing regions worldwide."

Franca,Three-Dimensional Settling Dynamics of Environmental Microplastics,"Resolving the three-dimensional settling dynamics of microplastic (MP) particles is essential for developing comprehensive models of MP transport in rivers─both vertically within the water column and laterally across the channel. While previous research has largely examined one-dimensional vertical settling velocities, little is known about the lateral drifting, settling paths, and horizontal velocities of MPs. To address this, we investigated the full three-dimensional settling behavior of environmental MPs collected from rivers and ocean water, as well as from estuarine and ocean sediment. Geometric properties of 127 environmental MPs were quantified by a dynamic particle image analyzer, and their settling trajectories were recorded and reconstructed via a multicamera tracking algorithm. This enabled quantification of a particle’s horizontal drift, tortuosity, amplitude and settling pattern, as well as vertical and horizontal velocities. Results showed that spherical MPs settled with minimal lateral displacement, whereas elongated particles, such as rod- and blade-shaped MPs, displayed pronounced lateral movements, reaching up to 65 times their equivalent diameter and averaging more than twice that of spheres. These dynamics suggest that elongated MPs may have a greater probability for wider lateral dispersion in rivers, increasing their likelihood for interactions with riverbanks and channel boundaries compared to more spherical shaped MPs."

However, the chemical composition and toxicity evolution of forest fire PM2.5 during atmospheric aging remains uncertain. This study investigated the chemical composition and toxicity on BEAS-2B cells of PM2.5 emitted from forest vegetation combustion under different atmospheric aging times (fresh, 2, 5, and 15 days) and explored the intervention of astaxanthin on the toxicity of PM2.5. Photochemical aging promoted the formation of secondary organic matter, NO3–, SO42– and NH4+, and the increase of acidic ions accelerated the dissolution of heavy metal elements in the particle phase. The concentration and toxic potency of PAHs and their derivatives declined with aging due to photo-oxidation. Oxidative stress induced by oxidative potential is a key factor in PM2.5-induced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. Variations in toxicity among vegetation types and aging times highlight the complexity of PM2.5 composition and its health impacts. Importantly, this study demonstrates that astaxanthin, a natural antioxidant, effectively mitigates PM2.5-induced toxicity, providing a promising therapeutic strategy. These findings underscore the urgent need for enhanced forest fire management, air quality interventions, and the development of targeted mitigation strategies to minimize the adverse health and environmental effects of forest fire PM2.5."

We developed an attribution-oriented framework using aerosol extinction (βExt) observations in Taichung, Taiwan (2020–2022), together with meteorological parameters and temporal markers, in an interpretable three-stage random forest model (R = 0.89, RMSE = 28 Mm–1). Planetary boundary layer height emerged as the dominant predictor, with contributions up to +135 Mm–1 under shallow layers (<200 m). Relative humidity exhibited threshold behavior, rising between 60–85% and decreasing above 90%, consistent with hygroscopic growth and wet scavenging. These patterns demonstrated physical consistency, while temporal markers captured recurrent emission cycles. Meteorology constrained visibility across a wide range (−50 to +150 Mm–1), whereas anthropogenic cycle varied within ±50 Mm–1, with severe degradation when both were positive (about 30% of cases) and improvements when anthropogenic cycle contributions were reduced during unfavorable meteorology or favorable meteorology offset high emissions. These results show that visibility degradation reflects separable yet interacting processes: meteorology sets broad constraints, while emission reductions offer quantifiable leverage. The attribution-oriented framework provides a physically interpretable basis for using visibility as both an atmospheric diagnostic and a policy-relevant target."

Both the large‐scale seasonal transition reflected by EOF analysis and the monsoon onset dates defined by local rainfall exhibited a clear interdecadal change. Correspondingly, there appears reduced rainfall and low‐level easterly anomalies over tropical Asia in May, indicating that the monsoonal westerly winds and convective activities cannot be stably established. Further analysis suggests that the SST warming in the equatorial western Indian Ocean serves as a possible driver of the delayed TASM onset. The warm SST anomalies trigger a Kelvin wave‐like response to the east, inducing anticyclonic circulation and easterly anomalies over tropical Asia, which hinder moisture transport and reduce rainfall. The reduced rainfall further strengthens anomalous easterly winds, thereby favoring the delayed onset of the summer monsoon."

Biases in the simulated tropical Pacific SST gradient across CMIP6 models significantly influence present‐day and future winter precipitation over South America through a stationary wave pattern resembling the Pacific–South American (PSA‐2) mode. Models with a weaker‐than‐observed SST gradient simulate a deeper trough east of South America, resulting in stronger wetting trends over northern Argentina. Applying observational constraints reduces uncertainties in projected precipitation trends by approximately 31%. For Tasmania and New Zealand, SST gradient biases impact the simulation of present‐day winter precipitation, but are not well correlated with future precipitation projections.

NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory‐3 (OCO‐3), aboard the International Space Station, is the first CO2‐monitoring mission to observe the sunlit portion of the diurnal cycle of total column‐averaged CO2 (XCO2) from space, since OCO‐3 collects data at various times of the day. Previous analysis of the climatological diurnal cycle in XCO2 measured from a ground‐based spectrometer in the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) suggests that the XCO2 diurnal cycle provides information about local fluxes. Here, we examine the diurnal signal at four TCCON sites spanning the tropics through midlatitudes. The signal is typically less than 1 ppm even at the peak of the growing season. Because relatively sparse OCO‐3 data observes a diurnal cycle at a given location only across multiple days, mesoscale transport variations complicate detection of the diurnal signal from the space‐based record. We bootstrap the long‐term records of TCCON XCO2 to quantify the minimum number of OCO‐3 observations necessary to infer the climatological diurnal cycle of XCO2, and find that even during the peak growing season, of order 10 observations per daylight hour for each month are required for robust detection. The number of required observations increases outside the growing season when fluxes are weaker. Our results show that dense and long‐term observation are required to infer the diurnal cycle from OCO‐3 or future CO2‐monitoring satellite missions."

This study compares two Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model experiments, a convection‐parameterized simulation with 12 km resolution (CRM) and a convection‐permitting simulation with 4 km resolution (CPM), evaluated for summer precipitation over Northwest China (NWC) during 2009–2011. Observational and model data were analyzed on a unified 4 km grid and in local time to conduct statistical harmonic analysis and thermodynamic diagnostics. The results show that the CPM substantially improves the simulation of precipitation amount, intensity, and frequency relative to the CRM, especially in mountainous regions. For total precipitation, the CPM yields a regional mean of 81.53 mm, closest to observations and outperforming ERA5 and CRM. Although the CPM slightly overestimates precipitation intensity, it exhibits higher spatial consistency and better captures the frequency of moderate to heavy rainfall. For wet‐day frequency, spatial correlation reaches 0.79 with a Root Mean Square Error of 0.11%, and the regional mean is also closer to observations. The CPM reproduces the observed dual‐peak diurnal cycle with reduced phase errors and amplitude bias. The CRM, constrained by cumulus parameterization, responds weakly to orographic forcing, limiting convective initiation and reducing precipitation intensity. In contrast, the CPM captures moisture convergence and vertical motion along windward slopes, producing stronger updrafts and more favorable thermodynamic conditions for convection. Overall, the CPM achieves simulations most consistent with observations, providing a more realistic representation of precipitation processes over the arid complex‐terrain region of NWC and demonstrating its potential to advance high‐resolution climate modeling."

However, existing projections have several limitations, such as their exclusion of the inverse‐barometer effect, their uncertainty due to internal variability, and/or their regional focus. Furthermore, the historical ASLC in the climate models used for these projections was not extensively evaluated. Here, we address these limitations using a large ensemble of simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6. Compared to observations, we find that four climate models perform particularly poorly. Excluding these, our multi‐model median projections for 2071–2100 indicate an average increase in the ASLC range at tide‐gauge locations of 7.9% under a high emissions scenario. Changes under lower scenarios are similar spatially but have a smaller magnitude. Regions with above‐average changes include Northwestern Europe, the Mediterranean, Asia, and the North Pacific. In several regions, the inverse‐barometer effect substantially contributes to the total changes. The median projected shifts in the peak month of the ASLC are mostly small, but like for the projected range changes, larger changes cannot be excluded given the substantial uncertainties. Finally, we find that the ASLC changes translate to differences between seasonal and annual mean sea‐level changes of up to 5.4 cm under the highest emissions scenario. Consequently, sea‐level projections that exclude seasonal changes under‐ or overestimate total sea‐level change in specific seasons, sometimes by more than 8%. This will influence projections of hazards and impacts tied to specific seasons."

 The mesopelagic zone, between 100 m and 1,000 m depth, is a crucial layer in which carbon preliminary coming down from the surface is transformed before a portion makes it into the deep ocean. While eddies and their fronts influence surface productivity and carbon export, their effects deeper in the water column remain poorly understood. Here we show the importance and contribution of dark carbon fixation—the conversion of inorganic into organic carbon by prokaryotes—across five contrasting hydrological features in the North Atlantic, using isotopic tracers and quantification of chemoautotrophy genes. The approach allows simultaneous assessment of dark carbon fixation and heterotrophic activity of prokaryotes living suspended in seawater and attached to gravitationally settling particles. Our results highlight that heterotrophic prokaryotes attached to sinking particles contribute up to 21% of the total organic carbon required to sustain prokaryotic metabolism under the influence of eddy fronts. By contrast, dark carbon fixation by suspended prokaryotes can contribute up to half of the total carbon input to the mesopelagic zone in the cyclonic eddy. Our findings challenge the idea that carbon cycling in the mid-depth ocean is uniform and highlight the need to integrate microbial fractions and physical heterogeneity into ocean carbon models.

 Sea surface temperature directly beneath tropical cyclones is crucial for their intensification. In the long term, global warming heats the surface oceans, intensifying tropical cyclones, whereas concurrently with a cyclone, inner-core surface cooling is induced by the cyclone itself curtailing its intensification. However, the magnitude of cyclone-induced cooling, or the trend in storm-local sea surface temperature, remains uncertain. Here we provide a quantification using global surface drifter data from 1992 to 2021. We find that storm-local sea surface temperatures are rising at 0.29 ± 0.07 °C per decade—about twice the average rate in tropical cyclone-active regions despite enhanced cyclone-induced cooling; furthermore, the magnitude of cyclone-induced inner-core cooling is far smaller than previous estimates. The inner-core cooling measured by drifters is −0.68 ± 0.04 °C, substantially less than microwave satellite estimates (−1.05 ± 0.06 °C). State-of-the-art climate models tend to overestimate inner-core cooling while underestimating storm intensity. These findings offer observational benchmarks for models and suggest that current projections may underestimate the strength, frequency and impacts of major tropical cyclones. Tropical cyclones cool the ocean surface less than previously thought, indicating that current projections may underestimate their future intensity and frequency, according to an analysis of global sea surface drifters data over 1992–2021."

 Storm-induced coastal extreme sea levels (ESLs) pose severe threats to infrastructure, economies, and ecosystems. However, projecting future ESL changes is hindered by the coarse resolution of climate models used in assessment reports, which fail to accurately capture tropical cyclones (TCs) and nor’easters. Here, we demonstrate that high-resolution Community Earth System Model (CESM) simulations realistically reproduce observed wind- and pressure-induced daily-mean extreme dynamic sea levels (DSLs), including the most extreme events. Under a high-emission scenario, we show that 50-year return DSLs (DSL50) decrease along the U.S. Texas and Northeast coasts but increase along the U.S., Louisiana, and Southeast coasts from 2006 to 2100, creating substantial spatial discrepancies between total DSL50 changes and mean DSL rise. Along the Gulf and Southeast coasts, DSL50 trends are primarily driven by TC frequency changes, while nor’easter frequency changes tend to govern trends along the Northeast coast. These findings challenge the traditional assumption of stationarity in storm-induced ESLs, underscore the importance of high-resolution climate models for regional coastal risk assessment, and represent a critical step toward more accurate projections of future ESLs in a warming climate."

 The mountainous Third Pole is a critical source of freshwater for water resource management across Asia, yet the historical and future dynamics of per-capita freshwater supply in this region remain poorly constrained by observations from a coherent, pan-regional perspective. Here, we show that by the end of the 21st century, mountain runoff in the Third Pole’s monsoon domain will increase substantially, whereas runoff in the westerlies domain will experience a non-significant decline. This finding challenges the prevailing paradigm that future runoff across the entire Third Pole will follow a unidirectional increasing trend as future precipitation. Regarding long-term freshwater availability till the end-of-21-century (1960‒2100), although mountain runoff shows a contrasting pattern with increase (decrease) at first and then decrease (increase) in the westerlies (monsoon) domain, the per-capita freshwater supply (for mountain basins and their downstream dependent regions) drops a lot in both westerlies and monsoon domains from the past (1960‒1970) to the near future (2030‒2050) due to rapid population increase.

 The Asian Water Towers play a crucial role by storing and releasing vast amounts of freshwater, thereby sustaining the base flow of major Asian rivers and water security for billions of people at sub-continent to hemispheric scales. Instrumental records, though spatially and temporally limited, indicate rapid warming in High Asia. However, the sensitivity and long-term resilience of these Water Towers remain uncertain. Here, we use an 814-year-long tree-ring record (including tree-ring width and maximum latewood density) from Picea likiangensis on the eastern Tibetan Plateau to develop a summer (June-September) temperature reconstruction. Our reconstruction reveals that the series has warmed by 1.5 °C during the modern observational period (1970–2023), which is 0.5 ± 0.4 °C above the pre-industrial baseline (1210–1850 or 1850-1900), making the summer of 2024 the warmest in the past eight centuries. This unprecedented warming amplifies winter runoff in the Brahmaputra, Indus, and Salween headwaters through a cascade of atmosphere-cryosphere feedbacks: enhanced meltwater and spring soil-moisture persistence promote earlier and lusher vegetation growth, which reduces summer albedo and further accelerates regional warming. Detection and attribution analyses identify volcanic and solar forcing as the main drivers of natural, pre-industrial variability before 1850 CE, whereas anthropogenic forcing is detected with high confidence (exceeding the 99% confidence level) after 2020 CE."

 Climate change and land use change are crucial determinants of crop water consumption, particularly in drylands where water scarcity limits crop production. In Central Asia, the effects of land use and climate changes on crop water consumption remain unknown. We estimated the dynamics of crop water consumption by mapping annual actual evapotranspiration from Landsat imagery from 1987 to 2019 for all irrigated croplands in the Amu Darya Basin, the largest transboundary river in Central Asia. Total crop water consumption increased by 10%, while average consumption per unit area increased by 18%. Climate change was the main driver of the rising crop water consumption; land use changes towards less water-intensive cropping practices offset only 3% of this increase. Our findings underscore that crop production will become increasingly challenging amidst accelerating climatic changes and that changing cropping practices alone will be insufficient to curb the growing water scarcity without a global commitment to reducing emissions.

 Human activities substantially reduce net ecosystem productivity (NEP) globally, yet debates remain over the contributions of land-use and land-cover change (LUCC), such as afforestation (afforestation and reforestation), versus non-LUCC ecosystem management (EM; e.g., forest tending, mountain forest restoration, and fire control). Here, we developed an analytical framework by harmonizing structurally consistent remote sensing-driven and climate-driven ecological process models to quantify the dynamic effects of LUCC and eight EM types on NEP from 2001 to 2021 in China by isolating anthropogenic effects from global change factors. We found that the NEP, which averaged 327 Tg C yr–1 across the 9.6×106 km2 country, increased at a rate of 16.1 Tg C yr–2. Forest management, including forest tending (5.53 Tg C yr–2) and mountain forest restoration (2.7 Tg C yr–2), primarily drove carbon sink increases. Although afforestation induced greater NEP growth per unit area, the total effect of forest management—due to its much greater coverage—was 4.14 times greater than that of afforestation (1.6 Tg C yr–2). Notably, the acceleration of China’s NEP after 2010 was closely associated with intensified forest management efforts. Moreover, the rate of NEP gains caused by forest tending investment (8.54 kg C yr–2 $–1) was much greater than that caused by afforestation investment (0.25 kg C yr–2 $–1). Our findings highlight the critical role of forest management in cost-effectively enhancing the carbon sink. This has important implications for global forest management strategies and achieving net-zero emissions. Forest management primarily drives the carbon sink enhancement in China from 2001 to 2021, achieving carbon gains at a rate over 4 times higher than afforestation, according to an integrated framework combining remote sensing-driven and climate-driven process models."

 Desertification is a global ecological and environmental problem, dynamic monitoring and accurate assessment of desertification are essential for restoring regional ecology and achieving sustainable development. Current desertification monitoring methods face dual challenges including unclear remote sensing mechanisms, non-robust extraction methods and the absence of high-resolution large-scale desertification products. This study constructs a comprehensive desertification index (CDI) by integrating multisource remote sensing data (Sentinel-1/2), incorporating three features —phenomenal indices (vegetation cover), cause indices (soil moisture) and essence indices (soil roughness)—on the basis of the multidimensional driving mechanisms of desertification physical processes. The Gaussian mixture model (GMM) was then applied to the CDI to automate desertification mapping for yielding the first 10 m-resolution annual desertification dataset in northern China (NCDMD, 2016–2024). The results demonstrated that the CDI-GMM based method achieves superior performance in mapping desertification scope across northern China in 2019, with an overall accuracy of 93.5 % and an overall accuracy of 86.4 % for desertification degree according to field survey data. In comparison, traditional approaches showed significantly lower accuracy, with the pixel dichotomy model (FVC-based) achieving 82.2 % in scope extraction and 50.3 % in degree classification, while the DDI feature space method reached 86.1 % and 64.2 %, respectively. Comparative experiments with five unsupervised classification methods (GMM, K-Means, MiniBatch K-Means, Jenks natural breaks, and Weka LVQ algorithms) indicated that the CDI combined with the GMM clustering algorithm can optimize the extraction of desertification and maintain stable performance, with an overall classification accuracy of over 93 %. Moreover, the NCDMD achieved consistent desertification mapping accuracies above 83 % throughout the 2016–2024 period, further demonstrating the robust spatiotemporal reliability of the proposed product. In summary, as a nationally significant high-resolution base dataset, the NCDMD not only fills the gap in high-precision desertification monitoring in China but also provides scientific support for ecological restoration assessment and land management policy-making."

 The successful deployment of multiple satellites equipped with passive microwave sensors has been pivotal for monitoring global soil moisture. Despite their importance, limitations including varying service durations, orbital scanning gaps, and differences in retrieval algorithms result in poor spatio-temporal consistency and coverage. This study introduces a two-stage paradigm to overcome the inconsistency of multi-sensors: Firstly, high-precision soil moisture is generated from SMAP L-band observations through the multi-channel collaborative algorithm (MCCA) as the physically anchored training target. Then, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network specifically designed for global gridded soil moisture dynamics is trained based on cross-calibrated brightness temperature observations (inclined orbit satellite sensors (TMI and GMI) and polar orbit satellite sensors (AMSR-E and AMSR2)) to obtain the high-quality retrieval accuracy of MCCA SMAP. Finally, the daily global soil moisture product (25 km resolution, 1997–2023) is provided by fusing the instantaneous soil moisture data of the four sensors from the model output. The study performed extensive validation with ground measurements and cross-validation with other datasets for both temporal and spatial consistency. The results indicate that the spatial distribution and seasonal variation patterns of MCCA-ML closely match those of MCCA SMAP, reflecting global climatic and geographic features. Verified by 24 dense global observation networks, the global r value of MCCA-ML SM is 0.76, the RMSE is 0.068 m3/m3, and the ubRMSE is 0.059 m3/m3, which well inherits the excellent performance of SMAP. During the service period of two or more satellites, the daily global land coverage of MCCA-ML SM usually exceeds 80 %, and it has a good ability to detect soil moisture."

 Soil moisture (SM), with its strong water absorption characteristics, profoundly alters the soil reflectance spectra and reduces the reliability of predicting other soil parameters. To achieve high-precision spectral simulation and remove SM effects efficiently, we propose a novel method based the optimized four-flux Maheu-Letoulouzan-Gouesbet (MLG) radiative transfer model. The model incorporates key soil properties (e.g., SM, organic matter, iron oxides, texture fractions) to better characterize soil spectral formation mechanisms. Additionally, the genetic algorithm, with a spectral continuity constraint, is developed for global parameter optimization, thereby simplifying the calculation process and improving the simulation reliability. Based on the optimal parameters, the SM factor is independently excluded and then the spectra are reconstructed to remove SM effects. Results demonstrated that the optimized MLG model achieved the highest accuracy in soil spectral simulation under both dry and wet conditions. Compared with the Kubelka-Munk (KM) model, the coefficient of determination (R2) improved from 0.87 to 0.94 in the ICRAF dry soil dataset and from 0.87 to 0.94 in the Nong'an wet soil dataset. The model maintained high accuracy (R2 = 0.81) even when the SM content exceeded 30 %, with strong effects in the water absorption bands around 1400 and 1900 nm. After removing SM effects from in-situ field spectra, corrected spectra exhibited stronger correlations with organic matter, iron oxides, and texture fractions, significantly enhancing prediction accuracy (R2 > 0.90, the relative percent difference (RPD) increase by 0.88–3.00). This physically-grounded method underscores the potential for accurate soil spectral simulation and SM effects removal, thereby strengthening the foundation for large-scale soil monitoring via satellite remote sensing."

 Blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs) are nature-based solutions critical for mitigating climate change and biodiversity loss. Accurate mapping of BCEs is fundamental to carbon accounting, maximizing their ecosystem service value, and informing conservation and restoration efforts. Yet, most existing studies focus on single ecosystem mapping and lack multi-class classification approaches capable of addressing the spectral similarity among different BCEs. To address this issue, we developed a novel algorithm on Google Earth Engine, namely Multi-class Blue Carbon Ecosystem Mapping by integrating Tide-level, Phenological, and Biophysical features (MBCEM-TPB) to simultaneously map mangroves, saltmarshes, and intertidal seagrass meadows, thereby characterizing the full composition of BCEs. Specifically, we first composited multi-temporal imagery under different tidal levels, phenological stages, and biophysical features from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. Based on spectral similarity principles, we performed training sample migration and then generated interannual blue carbon maps for 2019, 2021, and 2023 using Random Forest classifier. The algorithm was evaluated across eight study sites encompassing different BCEs combinations (two or three ecosystem types) spanning diverse climate zones, bioregions, and levels of ecosystem complexity. The overall accuracy of the MBCEM-TPB algorithm exceeded 93.65% across three periods, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability, even in complex intertidal landscapes.

In this study, based on SDGSAT-1 nighttime multispectral imagery and ground-based measurements, we compare the spectral ranges of human visual perception and satellite sensors, retrieve the urban nighttime RGB-band spectral distribution, and construct a light-environment inversion map and a blue-light ratio map. The results show that: (1) configuring bands with reference to the human visual spectral range is more suitable for remote sensing spectral retrieval, among which the B band exhibits the highest correlation with ground observations (correlation coefficient 0.879), followed by the R and G bands (0.700 and 0.688, respectively). (2) A comparison of six linear regression models with three machine learning models—random forest, back-propagation (BP) neural network, and support vector regression—indicates that machine learning models overall outperform linear models, while the three machine learning approaches achieve comparable accuracies, with cross-validated R2 values of approximately 0.65–0.70.

 Existing deep learning methods for ecological monitoring using polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) imagery primarily rely on coherency (T) or covariance (C) matrices derived from the linear polarization basis, often overlooking scattering information inherent in alternative polarization representations. To address this limitation, this study proposes a novel classification framework that explicitly incorporates a circular polarization basis into the PolSAR deep learning workflow. A circular coherency matrix (Cir), analogous to the conventional T matrix, was first derived through polarization basis transformation. Subsequently, a multi-basis input scheme was introduced to fuse linear and circular polarization features to enhance feature representation and information utilization. The proposed framework was validated on two benchmark datasets using multiple deep learning models, achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracies of 97.70% and 98.58%.Compared with standard linear-basis approaches, the proposed scheme yielded accuracy improvements of 2.86% over the T-matrix-based method and 2.26% over the C-matrix-based method. In addition, the incorporation of circular polarization features significantly enhanced physical interpretability, particularly for structurally complex targets such as forests and buildings. Overall, the findings provide an effective technical pathway for intelligent land cover classification and broader ecological monitoring.

 The accurate detection of active landslides influenced by reservoir water-level fluctuations is critically important for safeguarding hydropower infrastructure and protecting lives and property along riverbanks. However, most current InSAR-based approaches primarily rely on abrupt changes in phase or velocity gradients, while largely ignoring the causative environmental conditions that control landslide initiation. This study proposes a novel method for causative environment-informed active landslide detection with InSAR monitoring in the reservoir area. First, a four-directional velocity gradient matrix is constructed from time-series deformation data. Spatial morphology analysis is then used to filter out noise, extracting active deformation areas (ADAs) with continuous boundaries. Subsequently, five slope unit-based landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP) models are constructed to learn the causative environmental conditions of reservoir landslides systematically. Finally, an area under the curve (AUC) weighted voting strategy is employed to integrate deformation signals with environmental constraints, enabling the reliable identification of active landslides. Applied to the DHQ and HD reservoir areas of the Lancang River basin, the method identified 89 ADAs, achieving a 96% spatial overlap with manually interpreted deformation areas. Under the constraints of causative environmental factors, the overall F1-Score for identifying active landslides in the reservoir area reached 78.15%. Model interpretability analysis revealed that distance to river (DtR) plays a dominant role in both the formation and detection of reservoir landslides. The study further identifies key landslide-causing environment factors (LEFs) and high-susceptibility areas, providing valuable data support and decision-making guidance for reservoir slope disaster management, landslide monitoring, early warning, and risk prevention."

 Through k-means clustering analysis, this study identified three dominant anomalous patterns of autumn rainfall over West China: (1) a region-wide positive anomalies in precipitation, (2) a south-positive–north-negative dipole pattern, and (3) a west-positive–east-negative dipole pattern. The first two patterns account for most of the explained variance annually. The first pattern is influenced primarily by a strengthened and westward-extended western Pacific subtropical high and an intensified East Asian subtropical jet (EAJ), driven mainly by negative sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the tropical central-eastern Pacific. Reduced snow cover over the Tibetan Plateau also plays a moderating role by altering the thermal forcing that affects the EAJ. The second pattern is associated mainly with an anomalous anticyclone over the South China Sea and a weakened, southward-shifted EAJ, which are closely linked to El Niño-like SST anomalies in the tropical central-eastern Pacific and cold SST anomalies in the eastern North Atlantic. The above mechanisms were verified using the Linear Baroclinic Model and the ECHAM5 model."

 Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂), the primary anthropogenic greenhouse gas, is a critical tracer for understanding carbon-cycle–climate feedback. Despite intense industrialization and population density, the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) lacks high-frequency in situ CO₂ observations in its coastal and marine-influenced zones. In this study, the continuous atmospheric CO₂ measurements collected between December 2020 and December 2022 at an urban tower in Shanghai and a coastal background site in Shengsi were analyzed. Results reveal a distinct bimodal diurnal cycle in Shanghai, primarily driven by local anthropogenic emissions, whereas Shengsi exhibits a unimodal pattern more closely coupled to biospheric processes and marine dilution. Nighttime data from Shanghai station reliably represents urban background concentrations, as the stable concentration performance, less planetary boundary layer (PBL) and anthropogenic impacts. Wind and trajectory analyses link CO₂ enhancement at Shanghai to emissions from northern and northwestern sectors, whereas Shengsi concentrations are modulated by ocean-atmosphere carbon exchange—as evidenced by correlations with sea surface temperature, salinity, and pressure, alongside stronger negative links to normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and air temperature compared to Shanghai. Furthermore, partial least squares regression (PLSR) further highlights the dominance of local emissions at Shanghai (< 200 km scale) and oceanic/biospheric drivers at Shengsi, with regional transport amplifying variability across scales. These findings advance understanding of CO₂ spatiotemporal variability in coastal megaregions and provide an empirical basis for improving top-down carbon flux estimates and informing targeted climate mitigation strategies in eastern China."

Here we reveal, through gene-centric and genome-resolved metagenomics, that the bark of eight common Australian tree species hosts abundant and specialized microbial communities. The predominant bacteria are hydrogen-cycling facultative anaerobes adapted to dynamic redox and substrate conditions. Furthermore, bark-associated methanotrophs are abundant and can coexist with hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Microcosm experiments showed that bark microorganisms aerobically consume methane, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide at in planta concentrations and produce these gases under anoxia. Combined with in situ field measurements, we show that tree-dwelling microbiota metabolize multiple climate-active gases at marked rates within tree stems, highlighting a potentially substantial role in global atmospheric cycles."

Outbreaks are typically far-reaching because infectious spores can disperse aerially over thousands of kilometres. Rapid response to an outbreak requires a timely and accurate estimate of disease risk. We constructed an integrated mechanistic model of stem rust infection driven by seven-day meteorological forecasts and near-real time disease surveillance to inform mitigation at the national scale. Focusing on Ethiopia as the largest wheat producer of sub-Saharan Africa, yet where food insecurity is high, we evaluate the predictability of wheat stem rust infections during the rain-fed seasons of 2015–2022. The epidemiological model performs well at predicting disease observations two weeks ahead of time, from cross-validation root-mean-square-error values were in the range 0.25–0.35, ROC skill score 0.58–0.68, and odds ratio skill score 0.78–0.90. Results of alternative model scenarios show the benefit of assimilating recent surveys and simulating spore dispersal to achieve a good prediction. When driven by seven-day weather forecasts, the model therefore provides up to 21 days to respond to likely stem rust infections and prevent epidemic spread and subsequent crop loss. The mechanistic form and large scale of the epidemiological model has utility beyond in-season predictions, particularly with respect to scenario testing for practical interventions. The results demonstrated that long-distance dispersal has an important role in the spread of stem rust in a region of diverse agro-ecology. The forecast system presented here can be adapted to other plant pathosystems where aerial dispersal is the primary risk of disease spread."

While human activities and internal climate variability are recognized as important factors, their relative contributions and the underlying mechanisms in driving this drying trend remain unclear. Using detection and attribution analysis with multi-model ensemble simulations, this study reveals that anthropogenic aerosol forcing is the dominant driver of the recent accelerated drying in SWC, accounting for 77% (46% to 107% for one standard deviation) of all forcing. A reduction in aerosol emissions in Europe triggers an atmospheric wave train and results in a cyclonic anomaly in the upper troposphere over SWC, which suppresses upward motion and leads to less precipitation. Concurrently, an increase in aerosols over China results in local cooling and anomalous downward motion, creating conditions conducive to drought. Our findings highlight the substantial influence of anthropogenic aerosol emissions on regional climate change."

Nickel in Indonesia occurs in laterite ore deposits, and is extracted with open-pit mining, a process which induces land transformation of high carbon stock biomass sources such as forests. This study investigates the spatial and temporal impacts of nickel mining on land cover and biomass carbon stock by combining satellite imagery assessment with a national dataset of land cover classes and biomass carbon stock data from the national Forest Reference Emission Level (FREL) dataset. Focusing on the concession area between 2013 and 2022, 217 nickel mining concession areas within Indonesia were analyzed. Our results revealed that nickel mining activities induced 53% of the forest land transformation within the concession area. By 2022, approximately 6.9 million tCO2 were emitted from the land use induced by nickel mining activities, more than double the amount in 2013. If continued unabated, the trend could reach 7%–12% of the allowable Nationally Determined Contribution target in Indonesia for the land use sector in 2030. Moreover, we observed delays in the official recognition of mining areas in the national land cover map, which relies on manual visual interpretation and potentially leads to misclassification. Additionally, several instances of mining outside officially designated concession zones were detected, indicating governance gaps and regulatory compliance issues. These findings highlight the need for disclosure by mining companies and stronger governance in monitoring and regulating mining extraction activities to address the environmental cost of the energy transition."

While disease transmission is generally conditioned by multiple socio-economic factors, environmental suitability for vectors and viruses to proliferate is a necessary—although not sufficient—condition that needs to be closely monitored. To this end, the Aedes-borne dIsease monitoring of environmental suitability (AIMES) system improves on the disease transmissibility framework of AeDES, the most up-to-date system of this kind in the current literature.

When these events occur simultaneously, as compound hot-dry events, their impacts can be even more severe, particularly in dryland regions. Yet, their frequency, long-term dynamics, and driving factors remain poorly understood. Here, we leverage model-derived lake surface water temperature and satellite-derived surface area datasets to identify and analyze hot events, dry events, and compound hot-dry events in 2,338 lakes across global drylands from 1985 to 2020. We find that the occurrence of compound hot-dry event has significantly increased in 520 lakes, while 240 lakes have shown a significant decrease. Hot events and dry events individually increased in 1007 and 767 lakes, respectively. Furthermore, in most lakes, the temporal changes in compound hot-dry events are primarily driven by changes in dry event frequency, rather than hot events or their co-occurrence. These findings underscore the growing compound stress on dryland lake systems and emphasize the need for targeted adaptation and resilience strategies."

 Sorenson et al. (2024) studied fresh smoke plumes from the proximal Dixie fire in northern California and concluded that the smoke cooled the air and Earth surface below the smoke by shielding of incoming solar radiation. The so-attributed cooling was immediate, sudden and on par with diurnal temperature variations. This comment takes issue with their conclusions, reasoning, and method. By examining the same case and others, it is shown that the observed cooling within the smoke plume is caused by plume particulates sufficiently large to intercept and thereby alter upwelling thermal infrared radiation. The evidence presented is the same satellite and radar data employed by Sorenson et al. (2024), but expanded with temporal animations. A key element of the new analysis is the demonstration of smoke-associated cooling at nighttime, a circumstance decoupled from the solar-shielding explanation. The refutation of the proposed solar-shield-cooling in fresh smokes is an essential refinement of the constraints on the radiative cause-effect in such conditions."

Aerosol formation was observed when air masses crossed over the continent whereas less newly formed particles were observed when the winds were from the sea. Aerosol formation was favoured by low condensation sink and sunny dry conditions. 
 Aerosol formation is an important contributor to climate in different environments. Coastal ecosystems are of special interest, since their habitat types and species can be highly diverse which can lead to high variability in fluxes of aerosol precursor vapours. Here, we present the first results from an atmospheric observatory established in 2022 at the Tvärminne Zoological Station (TZS) on the southern coast of Finland as a part of the Centre for Coastal Ecosystem and Climate Change Research (CoastClim). This work is focused on new particle formation (NPF) and how it is influenced by the coastal environment. NPF occurred at TZS roughly as often as at the well-established boreal forest site Hyytiälä, 230 km north-north-east of TZS. However, only one-third of the events occurred during the same days at both stations. Similarly to Hyytiälä, NPF events were most likely to be observed when clean air masses from the Norwegian Sea pass over the boreal forest region. To understand the special characteristics of aerosol formation at the coast, we also studied local intermediate ion formation (LIIF), which can tell us about aerosol formation potential in the vicinity of the measurement site. LIIF was more abundant over the continent compared to the marine sector and it was favoured by low condensation sink and sunny dry conditions. This study presents an overview of aerosol size distributions at TZS and provides a basis for future work, which will aim to understand the sources of coastal aerosol precursors and their links to coastal ecology and biogeochemistry."

 We present a new ozone dataset generated using the Complete Data Fusion (CDF) algorithm, which combines limb observations from the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) aboard ESA's Envisat and nadir observations from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) aboard EUMETSAT's MetOp satellites during their overlapping operational period (2008–2011). The fusion aims to enhance ozone profile information in the Upper Troposphere–Lower Stratosphere (UTLS), particularly over the Himalayas – a key region for stratospheric intrusion events. The fused dataset, mapped onto the IASI–MetOp grid, includes ozone partial columns with associated uncertainty estimates (covariance matrices-CMs, averaging kernels-AKs, and a priori profiles). After tuning the algorithm on 2008 data, the product was validated for the 2009–2011 period against ozonesondes from the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WOUDC) stations across multiple latitude bands. Results show that the fused profiles improve vertical information content and reduce uncertainty, successfully propagating MIPAS information to lower altitudes even in regions lacking direct limb observations. While the dataset initially exhibited altitude- and latitude-dependent biases, primarily inherited from IASI, these were significantly reduced through bias correction. The final product is suitable for data assimilation and model evaluation, offering valuable support for atmospheric reanalyses and studies of troposphere–stratosphere exchange processes."

This repository provides a unique source of information for creating hyperspectral models for predicting photosynthetic traits and associated leaf traits in terrestrial plants. 
 Accurate assessment of leaf functional traits is crucial for a diverse range of applications from crop phenotyping to parameterizing global climate models. Leaf reflectance spectroscopy offers a promising avenue to advance ecological and agricultural research by complementing traditional, time-consuming gas exchange measurements. However, the development of robust hyperspectral models for predicting leaf photosynthetic capacity and associated traits from reflectance data has been hindered by limited data availability across species and environments. Here we introduce the Global Spectra-Trait Initiative (GSTI), a collaborative repository of paired leaf hyperspectral and gas exchange measurements from diverse ecosystems. The GSTI repository currently encompasses over 7500 observations from 397 species and 41 sites gathered from 36 published and unpublished studies, thereby offering a key resource for developing and validating hyperspectral models of leaf photosynthetic capacity.

It includes gas exchange data, derived photosynthetic parameters, and key leaf traits often associated with traditional gas exchange measurements such as leaf mass per area and leaf elemental composition.

 We present an improved medium (250 m) spatial resolution land mask based on augmenting earlier results of Mikelsons et al. (2021) to reflect recent changes in global water surface coverage. This land mask update is critical for remote sensing of coastal oceans and inland waters as this is the first step to properly identify water pixels from land pixels for satellite data processing. We show that clear-sky false color imagery derived for monthly and yearly time periods can be effectively used to identify changes to the surface water coverage. In addition, we also use Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to derive more accurate boundaries of new water bodies with complex geometries. We demonstrate improved coverage from satellite ocean color and inland water property retrievals with the improved land mask, including a range of new inland water bodies, as well as changes to the extent of the existing water bodies. We find that majority of inland water surface changes are directly linked to human activities and list the changes to water surface areas and approximate time periods for these water bodies.

The analysis reveals stable and persistent eddytree structures linked to major ocean currents. It also shows that common eddygroup boundaries play a key role in how eddies split and merge, highlighting the reciprocal nature of these dynamic ocean processes. 
 The splitting and merging of mesoscale eddies constitute significant dynamical processes and remain a central subject of investigation in oceanographic research. An eddy is defined as a closed contour derived from satellite altimetry data that encloses a seed point (a local extremum), while a closed contour containing multiple eddies and seed points is identified as an eddygroup. The eddytree is a rooted hierarchical tree structure in which eddygroups and eddies are organized by spatial containment. An efficient global algorithm is developed for the identification of mesoscale eddies and eddygroups, and an eddygroup area-based ranking algorithm is further proposed for constructing eddytrees. Compared with existing approaches, the overall computational efficiency is enhanced by a factor of eleven. For eddy tracking, a particle-drift method is applied to track the splitting and merging between eddygroups and eddies at the terminal nodes of the eddytree, which are ultimately connected into eddy directed acyclic graphs (referred to as eddygraphs). Based on these methods, a 31-year (January 1993–December 2023) global dataset of mesoscale eddies and eddygroups, as well as a trajectory dataset of eddy splitting and merging, is constructed. These datasets provide valuable references for advancing research on ocean dynamics and climate variability. Furthermore, statistical analyses of the 31-year identification results reveal the existence of relatively stable and persistent cyclonic and anticyclonic eddytree structures within the ocean. These structures correspond closely with large-scale ocean circulation patterns: anticyclones dominate in regions of strong western boundary currents; boundaries between cyclonic and anticyclonic eddytrees emerge at confluence zones of warm and cold currents; and island wake regions exhibit von Kármán–type vortex-street structures. Finally, we normalize and characterize the morphological evolution of eddygroups and eddies during splitting and merging processes. The analysis shows that before merging, pairs of eddies typically take on egg-shaped morphologies, which remain after merging, with the smaller eddy corresponding to the sharp pole of the egg-shaped structure. Similarly, before splitting, eddies also exhibit egg-shaped forms, and after splitting, the smaller eddy corresponds to the sharp pole of the pre-split structure. During this process, the research found that the common parent eddygroup plays an important role in the morphology of the splitting and merging events, where the boundary of the resultant eddy after merging is a degeneration of the boundary of the two pre-merging eddies' common parent eddygroup, while before splitting, the boundary of the single eddy evolves into the common parent eddygroup of the two post-splitting eddies. This also reveals the reciprocal nature of the dynamic processes of eddy splitting and merging.

A main source of the data are observations with satellites that weigh the changing amount of water by its mass attraction effect. The data allow for assessing how groundwater as the most important freshwater resource for mankind and ecosystems is affected by climate variability, climate change and withdrawal by human activities. 
 Groundwater is one of the most important freshwater resources for ecosystems and mankind. Because of its fundamental role in the Earth's water and energy cycles, groundwater has been declared an essential climate variable by GCOS, the Global Climate Observing System. Similar to other subsurface states and fluxes, groundwater is difficult to monitor at the global scale, with sufficient spatial coverage and over climate-relevant time scales. The Global Gravity-based Groundwater Product (G3P) is a global observation-based data set of large-scale groundwater storage variations. G3P capitalizes on the unique capability of GRACE and GRACE-FO satellite gravimetry as the only remote sensing technology to monitor subsurface mass variations. In a mass balance approach, satellite-based, in situ observation-based and model-based water storage variations of snow water equivalent, root-zone soil moisture, glacier mass, and surface water storage are subtracted from GRACE/-FO terrestrial water storage anomalies to result in monthly variations of groundwater storage. For this combination, the individual compartmental storage data are spatially filtered to be consistent with the spatial resolution of terrestrial water storage from satellite gravimetry. The G3P data set presented here covers the period 2002 to 2023 with monthly resolution on a 0.5° global grid and includes propagated uncertainty information. We describe the details of the G3P data processing chain and of each contributing data stream, provide examples of spatial and temporal groundwater storage variations represented by the G3P data set, and present exemplary evaluation results against in situ groundwater observations for three large aquifer systems. G3P is a prototype for an operational global groundwater service, under development as a cross-cutting extension of the existing portfolio of the Copernicus Climate Change Service C3S.

To address this, we used a multiscale modeling framework that embeds a high-resolution cloud model into each grid cell of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Earth System Model. This approach greatly improves the simulation of East Asian precipitation. 
 Traditional global climate models (GCMs) exhibit substantial biases in simulating precipitation over East Asia, largely due to uncertainties in convection parameterizations. To address this issue, we implement a Multiscale Modeling Framework (MMF), which explicitly resolves convection in a cloud resolving model, into the atmospheric component of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Earth System Model (CAS-ESM). Simulations using CAS-ESM with and without MMF reveal that the MMF implementation significantly reduces the wet bias around the Tibetan Plateau and the dry bias over South China and Southeast Asia. The intensity–frequency characteristics of precipitation are more realistically represented in the MMF version. In addition, the CAS-ESM with MMF better captures the monthly evolution of precipitation and simulates a more realistic seasonal migration of the East Asian rainband, albeit with a somewhat step-wise progression. Further enhancement is achieved by incorporating a convective momentum transport (CMT) parameterization, typically neglected in previous MMF implementations. This inclusion leads to a smoother northward migration of the rainband, more consistent with observations. Comparison with ERA5 reanalysis suggests that this improvement is associated with a more accurate simulation of the western Pacific subtropical high. These results demonstrate that MMF, especially when combined with CMT, substantially improves the simulation of East Asian precipitation. This modeling advancement offers a promising approach for evaluating regional precipitation responses to future climate change."

Conventional water quality standards rely on static concentration thresholds and fail to capture the dynamic nature of ammonia toxicity, which is strongly dependent on water temperature and pH. In this study, we combine high-frequency national water quality monitoring data with climate projections to evaluate both current and future chronic ammonia risks across China’s freshwater systems. Our results reveal that existing criteria substantially underestimate ecological risks: approximately 71% of chronic exceedance events go undetected under most commonly used static thresholds. These risks exhibit marked spatial heterogeneity, with over 80% of northern river basins experiencing elevated chronic exposure, while southern basins face less than half the national average. Climate change is projected to intensify ammonia risks even in regions with historically strong pollution controls. Under the high-emission scenario, the national exceedance rate increases from around 8% to nearly 14% in summer, primarily driven by rising temperatures and increasingly extreme hydrological conditions. These findings demonstrate the critical limitations of fixed-threshold regulation and highlight the need for dynamic, climate-adaptive ammonia toxicity risk assessments. To effectively protect freshwater biodiversity and water quality in the face of climate change, regulatory frameworks must incorporate temperature- and pH-sensitive criteria alongside targeted, region-specific mitigation strategies."

In this study, the ozonolysis of Z-3-hexenal (Z-3-H) and T-2-hexenal (T-2-H) in the presence of SO2 was investigated in a 30 m3 smog chamber. The experimental results showed that the SOA concentration produced by Z-3-H was far greater than that of T-2-H, indicating a significant influence of molecular structure on SOA formation. Through the mechanism study, a C3-carbonyl-RO2 radical (CHOC2H4O2) was regarded as a key intermediate playing a central role in the Z-3-H and T-2-H SOA formation. Due to the different double-bond positions, the ozonation of Z-3-H undergoes a relatively simpler pathway than T-2-H to produce this intermediate, which is considered one of the reasons for the higher SOA concentration of Z-3-H. Another key reason is that the average concentration of stable Criegee intermediate (sCI) in the Z-3-H/O3/SO2 system is much higher than that in the T-2-H/O3/SO2 system. The high level of sCI not only directly promotes a series of sCI-involved intramolecular and intermolecular reactions but also drives the rapid formation of H2SO4, which facilitates organosulfate production and acid-catalyzed aldol condensation reaction."

However, their exposure characteristics and toxicokinetics remain unclear. This study, conducted at a typical petrochemical park in northern China, is the first to systematically integrate biomonitoring data, external exposure assessment, and in vitro experiments to characterize SPAH body burden and total elimination half-lives in workers. Alkylated PAHs (APAHs) (1.86 ± 1.08 ng/mL) were the predominant SPAHs in blood, with concentrations 5.36 and 22.7 times greater than monohydroxylated PAHs (OH-PAHs) (0.347 ± 0.133 ng/mL) and nitrated PAHs (NPAHs) (0.0820 ± 0.0114 ng/mL), respectively. In urine, OH-PAHs (14.4 ± 11.9 ng/mL) exceeded APAHs (4.34 ± 2.82 ng/mL) and NPAHs (0.605 ± 0.384 ng/mL). External exposure assessment also identified APAHs and OH-PAHs, including 1-methylphenanthrene/3,6-dimethylphenanthrene (1-Me-Phe/3,6-DiMe-Phe), 1-methylpyrene (1-Me-Pyr), 3-hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene (3-OH-BaP), 2-hydroxyphenanthrene (2-OH-Phe), and 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OH-Pyr), as dominant contributors (25.3% of total PAH exposure). Estimated total elimination half-lives of representative SPAHs (1-OH-Pyr: 147 days; 3-OH-BaP: 191 days; 1-Me-Phe/3,6-DiMe-Phe: 828 days) may be markedly longer than those in the general population, possibly due to the impaired metabolism under chronic high exposure. Body mass index significantly influenced the SPAH elimination kinetics. This study provides critical insights into assessing the health impacts of SPAHs on highly exposed populations."

We collected 124 personal, 126 in-home, and 32 outdoor air samples with 66 adults from 37 rural households in 2023 and 2024. We detected chlorpyrifos, acephate, malathion, diazinon, and naled in air samples. We detected gas-phase chlorpyrifos in 63% of personal samples and 86% of homes─even though use of chlorpyrifos has been banned in California (with few exceptions) since January 2021─at 24 h average concentrations ranging up to 13 ng m–3 (personal) and 5.8 ng m–3 (in-home). We did not detect chlorpyrifos in outdoor air samples. Using linear mixed models, we found that higher indoor air temperatures and having more carpets/rugs were associated with higher indoor chlorpyrifos concentrations. The concentrations we measured were well below the California Department of Pesticide Regulation’s health screening level of 510 ng m–3 for chronic exposure to chlorpyrifos in air; nevertheless, our results suggest that persistent chlorpyrifos in home environments continues to contribute to nondietary exposure among California residents."

Salzmann,Tire-Wear Particles as Potential Ice-Nucleating Agents in the Atmosphere,"Tire-wear particles, generated through tire abrasion during driving, represent one of the largest global sources of microplastic pollution, with current annual emissions approaching 6 Tg. Due to their small particle sizes and low mass density, tire-wear particles can become airborne, undergo long-range transport, and potentially influence atmospheric processes. One critical but poorly understood pathway involves the heterogeneous freezing of supercooled cloud droplets, a key process in cloud glaciation and climate regulation. Here, we systematically investigate the ice-nucleating properties of laboratory-generated particles from summer, all-weather, and winter tires. Using optical microscopy as well as Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and Raman spectroscopy, we obtained particle-size distributions (∼100 μm mean diameter) and characterized the surface chemical compositions, confirming close similarity to the pristine tire materials. Ice-nucleation experiments performed with our custom-built IceBox instrument demonstrated that all tire particles consistently elevated the freezing temperatures of supercooled water droplets. The ice-nucleation performances of tire particles are found to be between feldspar and quartz, which are important mineral-based ice-nucleating agents in the atmosphere. Comparable results across all tire types suggest that major components such as rubber polymers or graphitic fillers are responsible for the observed activity. These findings establish tire-wear particles as effective atmospheric ice-nucleating agents, providing a baseline for future studies of environmentally aged tire particles and their potential roles in affecting the climate."

We present near‐sea bed observations of suspended sediment concentration C $C$ and estimates of vertical sediment flux, at high vertical‐ and temporal‐resolution, during trains of NLIW of depression. We quantify the contributions of vertical advection and turbulent mixing to C $C$. Vertical advection was important during the leading wave and the turbulent mixing flux was important over the entire wave train. Maximum C $C$ was highly correlated with the maximum horizontal current speed squared and was only weakly correlated with the maximum vertical velocity. Boundary layer‐induced turbulence was thus inferred to be the key driver of net vertical sediment flux over wave trains of this type. Estimating the maximum total horizontal speed (i.e., wave‐induced plus background) is sufficient for modeling sediment vertical dynamics in shelf‐scale modeling studies."

We analyze temporal trends in geogenic solutes in the context of changing precipitation, discharge, and water‐rock interactions. We show that changes in stream chemistry are variable across the U.S. and are driven by multiple drivers that impact subsurface processes over long‐timescales, including warming temperatures, changing groundwater storage, road‐salt application, and acid‐rain recovery. To fully map how climate and anthropogenic perturbations are impacting water quality, we explore the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in subsurface geochemical reactions and the propagation of the signals of those reactions into surface waters, in particular, how long‐transit times and intermediate geochemical reactions may delay in‐stream responses to perturbation."

 Widespread permafrost thaw—indicated by the thickening of the soil active layer, which undergoes seasonal freeze–thaw cycles above the permafrost—has important implications for the thermal, hydrological and ecological processes of Arctic–boreal ecosystems. Yet, how thaw-driven biophysical and ecological feedbacks alter Arctic–boreal fire regimes remains poorly understood. Here we quantify these feedbacks by integrating long-term observations of soil active layer thickness (1997–2018) with a causal inference model and a space-for-time approach. We show that the thickening of the soil active layer can amplify summer fire regimes across the Arctic–boreal region, resulting in intensified fire weather conditions, increased burned area and higher fire emissions. The fire amplifications were driven by thaw-induced reductions in surface albedo and soil moisture that intensify summer warming and atmospheric aridity, further reinforced by enhanced vegetation growth and the desiccation of soil organic matter. These cascading feedbacks may create a positive fire–climate feedback loop, whereby more burning accelerates carbon release from vegetation and soil, further destabilizing northern ecosystems. Our findings highlight the potential escalating fire and climate risks initiated by permafrost thaw, emphasizing the urgent need for immediate climatic action to mitigate climate change and the compounding impacts of wildfires and permafrost degradation.

 Wurtzite ferroelectrics, particularly aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN), have emerged as a promising material platform for non-volatile memories, offering high polarization values exceeding 100 μC/cm2. However, their high coercive fields (>3 MV/cm) have limited cycling endurance to ~107 cycles in previous reports. Here, we demonstrate unprecedented control of polarization switching in AlScN, achieving write cycling endurance exceeding 1010 cycles—a thousand-fold improvement over previous wurtzite ferroelectric benchmarks. Through precise voltage modulation in 45 nm-thick Al0.64Sc0.36N capacitors, we show that while complete polarization reversal (2Pr ≈ 200 μC/cm2) sustains ~108 cycles, partial switching extends endurance beyond 1010 cycles while maintaining a substantial polarization (>30 μC/cm2 for 2Pr). This exceptional endurance, combined with breakdown fields approaching 10 MV/cm in optimized 10 μm diameter devices, represents the highest reported values for any wurtzite ferroelectric. Our findings establish a new paradigm for reliability in nitride ferroelectrics, demonstrating that controlled partial polarization and size scaling enables both high endurance and energy-efficient operation.

 While of critical importance for coastal communities, Antarctica’s future sea-level contribution remains highly uncertain. This uncertainty largely stems from the complex interaction between the ocean and the ice shelves, which is both difficult to observe and model. To better understand and constrain land-ice response to reduced buttressing exerted by ice shelves, efforts are needed to fully comprehend basal melt rates and their impact on ice shelf weakening and retreat. Here we present high-resolution basal melt maps (50 m) of vulnerable ice shelves based on a combination of stereo imagery and satellite altimetry, revealing pronounced channelized melting patterns whose melt rates were previously substantially underestimated (42–50%), which could result in faster channel breakthrough.

 Future changes in extratropical cyclones (ETCs), their moisture transport, and their connection to atmospheric rivers (ARs) remain uncertain. Here, using downscaled simulations from the Community Earth System Model version 2 under the high-emissions scenario SSP5-8.5, we show that moisture uptake associated with intense North Atlantic ETCs will increase by ~14.5%, or ~3.29% per Kelvin of global warming by the end of this century. Subregional analysis revealed greater increases during the most intense cyclone stages, with changes of 52.1% (11.8% K−1) in the eastern North Atlantic, 33.4% (7.6% K−1) in the western North Atlantic, and 29.1% (6.6% K−1) in the northern North Atlantic. Rather than a consistent increase within existing climatological source regions, the moisture origin exhibits a geographic shift, likely linked with changes in storm-track pathways and ocean circulation under warming. Using a novel method to couple ETC moisture sources with ARs, we demonstrate that while this coupling continues to be a defining characteristic at the basin scale, the strength of their association is projected to weaken. Historical differences between low- and fully associated ETCs, particularly in terms of moisture sources and proximity to the AR axis, diminish and lose significance in a warming climate."

 The North Atlantic climate is strongly influenced by large-scale atmospheric circulation, including the storm track and jet stream, which shape regional precipitation, temperature, and wind patterns. Climate models project an intensification of the winter circulation through the 21st century, however, it remains unclear whether abrupt or non-monotonic changes might occur under ongoing warming. Here we show that under continued CO2 emissions beyond 2100, the intensification reverses, with both the storm track and jet stream returning toward their 20th-century states. We attribute this reversal to the logarithmic relationship between CO2 and temperature, which leads to a reduced meridional temperature gradient and weakened atmospheric circulation at high CO2 concentrations. This behavior also alters regional climate patterns, reversing storm track-induced warming and wetting at higher mid-latitudes and cooling and drying at lower mid-latitudes over eastern North America and the North Atlantic. Our findings suggest that mitigation policies should account for the pace of continued emissions as well as the potential reversals in climate impacts."

 Anthropogenic climate change is intensifying tropical cyclones, and some studies suggest that they are now impacting regions farther from the equator, though uncertainties remain. This study examines the North Atlantic (NATL) basin’s autumn climatology, focusing on environments conducive to tropical transitions (TTs), as most cyclones affecting Europe that originate from TTs occur during this season. Ten CMIP6 climate models under the historical, SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios are used, covering the 1981–2100 period, with the ERA5 reanalysis employed as a reference to support the results. The study introduces the Tropical Transition Favorability Index (TTFI), which is a novel metric that integrates key parameters to quantify environmental favorability for TTs in the NATL. Findings indicate a progressive tropicalization of the NATL basin under both SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5, with a more pronounced effect under the latter, driven by increased sea surface temperatures and humidity, while dynamic constraints weaken. Although in some cases the magnitude of projected future changes is comparable to existing CMIP6 models biases with respect to ERA5, the results suggest a higher likelihood of TTs, increasing the risk from these destructive systems."

During 2007-2023, the Danish temperate wetland site functioned as a carbon dioxide sink (−41 gC-CO2m-2yr⁻1) and a methane source (0.71 gC-CH4m⁻2yr⁻1), with significant declines in seasonal amplitudes of methane flux, net ecosystem exchange, and gross primary productivity. Scenario analysis shows maintaining a stable water table at 9 cm depth offers the optimal trade-off between carbon sequestration and methane release. Our findings reduce the uncertainty in wetland methane estimates under climate change and highlight the importance of site-specific rewetting strategies to optimize mitigation efforts. Observations and model work from a Danish temperate wetland during 2007-2023 indicate that the site acted as a carbon dioxide sink and a methane source, and a stable water table at about 9 cm depth can be recommended as the best rewetting solution"

 Priority areas are typically identified based on mean conditions, while ignoring variance around the mean (i.e., “stochasticity’). This is problematic as high environmental stochasticity can increase extinction risk and reduce the effectiveness of protected areas. Here we use daily Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data from 1981 to 2025 to generate spatially-explicit estimates of both the mean and variance in environmental productivity across Canada. From these models, we found that environmental stochasticity shows strong spatial structure and has been steadily increasing over the past four decades. Additionally, stochasticity had a negative effect on species richness. We found no clear relationship between stochasticity and protection status, suggesting that Canada’s network of protected areas are not well-buffered against a climate-change induced increase in stochasticity. Promisingly, we identified 2,709,580 km2 of currently unprotected land that may minimise the impact(s) of growing stochasticity. This work provides a framework for incorporating environmental stochasticity into conservation planning.

 Snow water is key to water supply in cold regions and beyond. Here we introduce Snow Water Availability that quantifies water stored in the snow-covered portion of an area. By integrating a plausible set of available gridded datasets for snow depth, density, and cover fraction, we form four estimates of Snow Water Availability at the 25 × 25 km2 across Canada and Alaska. We show that annual long-term mean of Snow Water Availability over the domain was 996 ± 170 km³ during 2000–2019. While annual Snow Water Availability increased from 799 ± 121 km³ in 2000-2009 to 1208 ± 231 km³ in 2010-2019, significant losses (p-value ≤ 0.05) were observed in ~3% of the domain, mainly in North American Cordillera, headwaters to major rivers in western Canada. These losses alongside insignificant decreases across southern Canada can threaten water supply in a quarter of the country, where ~86% of its population reside.

 Permanent storage of gigatons of carbon in basalt requires thick, uncompartmentalized sequences that allow lateral dissipation of CO2 away from injection sites. Here we assess the presence of flow barriers by evaluating the variations in 87Sr/86Sr patterns in pore water, a method used extensively in sedimentary successions. Present-day pore water 87Sr/86Sr was measured from residual salts in core samples, while past water compositions were reconstructed from carbonate cements of different ages. We reveal smooth and uninterrupted trends in strontium isotopes through a 100 m thick basalt section indicating a common fluid reservoir unaffected by low-permeability massive lava flow interiors. The data further indicate that unconsolidated overburden sediments act as a good seal preventing seawater to mix with in situ pore water, and buoyant supercritical CO2 to leak. Finally, basaltic sequences form viable targets for CO2 storage and suggests that fractures may bypass low-permeability units to create a well-connected reservoir system. 87Sr/86Sr pattern of residual salts from a 100 m basalt section reveal a vertically connected pore water system unaffected by massive lava flow interiors, supporting continental margin basalt sequences as viable reservoirs for permanent CO2 storage."

 Livable cities enhance urban economic development, improve physical and mental health, foster well-being, and foster urban sustainability. Evaluating urban livability is therefore important for policymakers to develop urban planning and development strategies aimed at improving livability. Mainstream methods of evaluating urban livability assign different weights to diverse indicators extracted from survey data, statistical data, and geospatial data. To relieve such time-consuming and labor-intensive data collection, this study proposes a transformer-based multi-task multimodal regression (TMTMR) model for the simultaneous evaluation of urban livability focusing on five domain-specific scores. Pretrained state-of-the-art computer vision and natural language processing models serve as backbones to extract features from high spatial resolution remote sensing (RS) images, digital surface models (DSM), night light remote sensing (NLRS) images and point of interest (POI) data. An attention mechanism helps the TMTMR model to assign varying significance levels to features from different modalities, thus capturing both intrinsic information and interrelationships among modalities for livability evaluation. Focusing on 13 Dutch areas, our research demonstrates that the TMTMR model efficiently evaluates urban livability with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.605 to 0.779, and root mean square error values between 0.070 and 0.112 in four unseen test areas. Furthermore, we analyze the synergy between different modalities. We found that modalities of urban livability can be effectively evaluated by aligning, in a descending order, contributions from RS images, NLRS images, DSM, and POI data. We demonstrated that the proposed TMTMR model is capable of effectively evaluating urban livability directly from multimodal geospatial data."

 High-intensity forest fires have significant destructive impacts on ecosystems and society, and are an increasing concern worldwide. Accurate probabilistic risk assessment of these fires can effectively enhance the ability to guide wildfire management, particularly for large and extreme fires. However, forecasting large-scale fire behavior characteristics remains challenging, limiting the effectiveness of spatial estimations of high-intensity forest fire potential (HIFFP). This study aims to integrate fire spread simulations and machine learning (ML) algorithms to enhance HIFFP estimations through multi-step time-series forecasting on fire rate of spread and fireline intensity at regional scales. We first established a high-intensity forest fire dataset based on remote sensing-informed fire spread simulations from the Weather Research and Forecasting coupled fire-spread model (WRF-SFIRE), incorporating explanatory variables on fuel, weather, climate, and topography. Then, the knowledge-guided framework (multi-step time series-based ML, MTS-ML) was designed to estimate HIFFP within different hours after fires occur, integrating with Bayesian Network (BN), Random Forest (RF), and copula models. Results indicate that MTS-ML improved HIFFP modeling compared with ML-based methods, achieving AUC (the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) > 0.95 (with ∼0.04 increments), F1 score > 0.85 (with ∼0.08 increments), and MAE < 0.15. Topographic index, foliage fuel load, and wind speed are identified as primary contributors to HIFFP. Probabilistic mapping of HIFFP represents wildfire danger, which is closely linked to burn severity and fire-induced carbon emissions. This study presents a novel framework for enhancing regional risk assessment of high-intensity forest fires, providing valuable guidance in wildfire control and management."

 Accurate characterization of the role of the dry tropics in the global carbon cycle requires precise estimation of woody biomass changes due to ecological and anthropogenic change, including deforestation, forest degradation, regrowth, mortality and enhanced tree growth due to climate change. L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter observations offer a reliable option to consistently map these processes as they are (i) available globally since 2007 (JAXA ALOS-1, ALOS-2 and ALOS-4), and (ii) sensitive to woody structure, such as aboveground biomass density (AGBD) up to ∼100 t ha−1. However, we lack multi-site empirical understanding of the scattering processes that determine the relationship between L-band SAR and woody vegetation structure in the dry tropics, and how this is mediated by soil properties.This study used observations from ground plots in Africa (n = 171), Australia (n = 6), and South America (n = 44) to understand the impact of vegetation structure and soil properties on spatially and temporally coincident fully-polarimetric L-band SAR data. Fully-polarimetric L-band SAR single-look complex data were converted to scattering mechanisms/parameters using van Zyl, Cloude-Pottier, and Freeman-Durden polarimetric decompositions to elucidate the physical mechanisms involved. Multivariate SAR-vegetation-soil relationships were analysed using a theory-informed structural equation modelling approach. The strongest positive effects on volume scattering come from stem density (stems ha−1) and mean stem biomass of trees, and soil water and sand content (standardized regression coefficients of 0.3, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.1, respectively). The only significant effect on surface scattering is from stem density (0.1). Significant effects on double bounce scattering are from stem density (0.3) and soil sand content (−0.2). Since AGBD is the product of stem density and mean stem biomass, this modelling framework points to a stronger effect from the number of trees rather than their size/biomass. Therefore, AGBD maps relying solely on radar intensity may not reflect significant changes when AGBD is increasing due to the growth of existing stems. Additionally, such maps might overestimate changes in AGBD when driven by the recruitment of new stems or loss of existing stems. Full-polarimetric observations allow the decomposition of the radar signal into volume scattering, surface scattering, and double bounce, enabling the inversion of structural equation models to retrieve both stem density and mean stem biomass. This provides a more comprehensive description of forest structure compared to retrieving only AGBD. As this approach depends on full-polarimetric data, its effectiveness is closely tied to the availability of such observations. Our findings underscore the value of recent and upcoming missions such as ALOS-4 PALSAR-3, BIOMASS and ROSE-L, and highlight the need to prioritise the acquisition of quad-pol SAR data to support future large-scale retrieval of vegetation structure attributes."

 Semantic segmentation, the process of assigning a semantic label to each pixel in an image, is a critical computer vision task for extracting detailed information from remote sensing data. However, its application to complex geographical contexts, such as coastal wetlands, is often constrained by the need for highly specialized implementations, class imbalance, and limited accessibility for non-specialists. This paper introduces a novel, modular, and adaptive open-source framework for semantic segmentation tailored to satellite imagery. Designed for maximum flexibility, the framework supports both binary and multi-class segmentation tasks and incorporates specific training strategies to handle severe class imbalances inherent in ecological detection, such as salt marsh mapping. The implementation provides a fully configurable pipeline that bridges the gap between Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Deep Learning (DL). It integrates QGIS for intuitive spatial preprocessing and grid generation with a Python-based training and prediction workflow, thereby democratizing access to advanced segmentation techniques. The framework is architecture-agnostic, allowing the seamless deployment and benchmarking of various state-of-the-art encoder–decoder models, which are effective at combining multi-scale contextual information with high spatial resolution. A key contribution is the integration of a multifaceted training methodology that includes hybrid loss functions with dynamic class weighting and spectral-consistent data augmentation to ensure robust model generalization from limited and imbalanced datasets. We demonstrate the framework’s efficacy and scalability through two distinct case studies: a multi-class land cover classification on the Crozon Peninsula using Pléiades and a binary salt marsh detection in the Mont-Saint-Michel Bay Sentinel-2 imagery. The results show that accurate segmentation can be achieved with modest computational resources, promoting more sustainable and ethical AI applications in environmental monitoring. This work provides a critical tool for researchers and practitioners aiming to apply advanced DL segmentation to domain specific remote sensing challenges beyond conventional benchmarks."

 Ratoon rice plays a vital role in boosting land productivity and contributing to stable food supplies under the context of global climate change. This system offers these advantages by demonstrating the capacity to produce an additional grain yield of 5–6 t ha−1 from the ratoon season, while simultaneously reducing the growth duration by 44–48 days compared to conventional double-season rice cultivation. However, its precise spatial distribution remains unclear under varying climatic and surface conditions, and remote sensing-based monitoring of ratoon rice has received limited attention. Existing methods often struggle to accurately distinguish ratoon rice from other morphologically similar types, such as double-season rice, and are further hampered by frequent cloud cover and rainfall, compromising optical sensing effectiveness. This study proposes a two-step ratoon rice (TSRR) mapping method using multi-source remote sensing data at the parcel scale. The TSRR method integrates Sentinel-1A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 optical imagery, utilizing the distinct growth characteristics of main-season and ratoon rice. It employs object-based segmentation and two novel indices—the SAR-based paddy rice index (SPRI) and the SAR-based ratoon rice index (SRRI)—without relying on detailed phenological information. Results indicate that the TSRR method effectively distinguishes ratoon rice from other paddy rice types, achieving an average overall accuracy (OA) of 0.87, with particularly high performance in separating ratoon rice from double-season rice. The TSRR method demonstrates strong robustness and transferability across different regions, which can provide a reliable solution for large-scale paddy rice mapping, especially in cloud-prone areas with limited optical data availability, and offers valuable support for crop monitoring, yield estimation, and national agricultural inventory initiatives."

 The accurate estimation of surface nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from satellite observations is essential for regional air quality management using spaceborne sensors. However, estimation performance can vary significantly under different local and temporal conditions. This study investigates specific conditions causing satellite-based surface NO2 estimators underperformance. We developed a machine-learning model using hourly NO2 vertical column densities from the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS), along with meteorological and land-use data for December 2021 to November 2022. The model was trained and validated using observations from 614 ground-based monitoring stations across South Korea and demonstrated strong overall performance (R = 0.88). The model accuracy varied by station type and temporal conditions. Higher performance was observed at urban and roadside stations (R = 0.83–0.87). Contrastingly, national background and rural stations exhibited lower correlations (R = 0.66–0.68); and port stations showed moderate performance (R = 0.74). Seasonally, the performance peaked in winter (R = 0.89) and declined in summer (R = 0.82). Diurnally, better performance was observed between 09:45 and 14:45 Korea Standard Time (KST) when higher number of GEMS observations were available. The combined analysis further showed that urban and roadside sites maintained a consistently high performance during winter. These results indicate strong influence of spatial and seasonal factors on model accuracy. Therefore, local NO2 levels, boundary layer data, and land–sea corrections should be considered to improve satellite-based surface NO2 estimation. The findings of this study provide practical guidance on the spatiotemporal limits of geostationary monitoring, which can be adopted, with improvements, in establishing geostationary satellites as reliable tools for operational air quality policies development and public health assessments."

 On 17 December 2023, an exceptionally heavy rainfall event occurred at the southeastern tip of Tamil Nadu, with Kayalpattinam of Thoothukudi district recording 94 cm of rainfall in a single day, which caused widespread flooding in the region and its neighbourhood. This event was triggered by a low-pressure (LP) system moving northwestward through a complex terrain setting, bordered by the Western Ghats (WG) to the west and the Sri Lankan Mountains to the east. This synoptic event presents a rare opportunity to examine lateral and cross-barrier topographic influences on extreme rainfall. Three high-resolution cloud-resolving simulations were conducted using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to investigate the role of mountains in modulating this localised extreme rainfall. The study carried out (1) a control simulation (CNTRL) with natural terrain, (2) a simulation without the Sri Lankan Mountain topography (NTSLI), and (3) a simulation with removing mountains over the entire domain (NTWDOM). The CNTRL simulation accurately reproduced the features of the observed rainfall and indicated an extension of the LP system towards the east coast, leading to a sustained localised moisture convergence and deep convection. Further, the simulation highlighted the formation of a cold pool in the windward regions of the WG due to the evaporative cooling and effective orographic blocking during the event. The NTSLI simulated eastward extension of LP system with its centre shifted in southwestward compared to the CNTRL and exhibited relatively stronger easterly winds in the absence of the Sri Lankan Mountains. The enhanced easterlies produced multiple moisture convergence zones, thereby altering convective processes and leading to reduced rainfall over the Tamil Nadu coast. The simulation indicated a southwestward shift in the rainfall pattern. In contrast, the NTWDOM simulation, with no orographic barriers, inhibited cold pool formation, dispersed moisture convergence, and resulted in weaker convection, as well as a westward displacement of rainfall towards the Arabian Sea. Our results clearly highlight that, apart from cross-orographic barriers, lateral orographic features also play a critical role in modulating the location, intensity, spatial distribution, and evolution of extreme rainfall events by influencing synoptic systems, moisture dynamics, and convective processes."

 Amid escalating climate change and environmental instability, understanding the origins, transport mechanisms, and climatic-environmental impacts of intensifying East Asian dust storms has become crucial for global sustainability science. However, current research still faces critical limitations with lacking city- or site-level resolution for source apportionment, and quantitative assessments of the climatic and environmental effects of severe dust events are still insufficient. Here, we integrated in situ measurements, reanalysis datasets, and numerical simulations to investigate the extreme East Asian dust storm in March 2023. Results indicated that the Gobi Desert was the dominant source, contributing approximately 74.9–94.6 % to PM10 levels across four northern Chinese cities. Fine particles (2.5–5.0 μm) exhibited faster and higher-altitude transport than coarse particles (>7.5 μm), with consistent northwestward advection. Size-dependent deposition regimes emerged – dry deposition peaked for 7.5–10 μm particles, while wet deposition shifted from 5 to 7.5 μm in source regions to 2.5–5.0 μm in downwind North China. Crucially, we quantify the dust–climate feedback loop where aerosol-induced surface cooling by reducing surface solar radiation of 2.4–4.8 W m−2, which in turn suppresses surface turbulent kinetic energy and decrease the boundary layer height up to 40 m. The enhanced boundary layer stability subsequently promoted futher dust accumulation. By elucidating this positive feedback mechanism, our study moves beyond established correlations to reveal a key process amplifying extreme dust storms, with critical implications for predicting their intensity and impacts under a changing climate."

Using idealized emission-driven climate simulations, this analysis examines changes in the extreme fire weather conditions under net-zero emission (ZeroE) and net-negative emission (NegE) scenarios. Compared to peak CO2levels, the NegE scenario achieves substantially greater fire danger mitigation, particularly in climatologically high-fire-danger regions, because of lower temperatures and increased relative humidity. In contrast, the ZeroE scenario leaves fire danger elevated globally, especially in Northern low-latitude regions. Regional responses are shaped by differences in atmospheric moisture supply, influenced by changes in the strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and the latitudinal position of the intertropical convergence zone. These findings highlight the crucial role of aggressive CO2removal strategies in mitigating fire weather dangers and underscore the limitations of ZeroEs alone in addressing global wildfire challenges."

These events tend to persist longer, causing widespread socioeconomic disruption. Using long-term satellite observations across North India, we find that elevated aerosol concentrations are associated with thicker fog and larger droplets near the fog top. However, the underlying mechanism of this observed relationship remains unclear. High-resolution aerosol-coupled fog simulations suggest that increased aerosol loading enhances fog droplet number concentrations, leading to greater latent heat release. This, in turn, results in buoyancy-induced vertical mixing within the fog. Simultaneously, the increased water content intensifies longwave radiative cooling at the fog top, promoting cool-saturated conditions that further favor the formation of condensate and larger droplets. Together, the aerosol-induced vertical mixing—driven by thermodynamic uplift and radiative cooling—amplifies condensational processes, causing fog invigoration. We find that this phenomenon is especially pronounced during nighttime. Overall, our findings indicate a mechanistic pathway by which aerosols increase fog thickness over Northern India."

While we underestimate the ocean carbon sink when mimicking real-world sampling, adding available sailboat data does not substantially improve reconstructions. Nevertheless, increased sampling reveals a stronger carbon sink, particularly between 40°S and 60°S. The improvement persists with hypothetical measurement uncertainties, but substantial differences arise depending on whether positive or negative biases are applied to the race track data. While we show that two additional circumnavigations already improve the ocean mean sink estimate, we further highlight the finding that the additional data remain insufficient to correct the overestimated CO2sink trend, calling for continuation of the ongoing data collection."

However, a fundamental understanding of the in situ formation of HPs in atmospheric waters remains incomplete and controversial. Here, we report direct observations of HP (hydrogen peroxide, alkyl HP, and peroxycarboxylic acid) formation with quantum yields 10−4– 10−3, through photochemistry of α-keto acids [α-KAs; glyoxylic acid, pyruvic acid (PA), and 2-ketobutyric acid]. These quantum yields are comparable to reported HP formation rates in cloud and fog waters, suggesting that α-KA photochemistry could contribute 5 to 15% of the observed atmospheric hydrogen peroxide in aqueous phases, based on typical α-KA concentrations (0.1 to 10 μM). The model results showed that the photochemistry of excited triplet3PA*contributes ~40 and ~33%, respectively, to the formation of hydrogen peroxide and peroxyacetic acid at pH 2.5. Given the recurrent detection of α-KAs in organic-rich aerosols, this photochemistry represents a notable in situ source of HPs."

This study used a life-cycle assessment that accounted for methane leakage to evaluate whether China’s building electrification policies can yield net climate benefits. The study focused on residential electrification across regions, covering cooking, domestic hot water, and space heating. Results show that emissions from heating regions were 4 to 6.43 times higher than those in non-heating regions. Among heating regions, the lowest emissions came from gas-based systems (wall-hung gas boilers, gas water heaters, gas stoves), emitting 37.78% less than coal-based systems. Fully electrified systems (air-source heat pumps, induction cooktops) reduced emissions by 27.25% compared to coal scenarios but emitted 16.93% more than gas-based ones. Under the current coal-dominated power mix, electrification does not necessarily reduce overall building emissions. The study identifies grid emission intensity thresholds for electrification to be climate-positive and compares them to actual regional grid factors. Findings indicate that if electrification is implemented immediately, more than 59% of regions would see an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Projections based on a cleaner energy mix suggest tailored electrification timelines are essential. This analysis supports strategic, region-specific electrification to help China achieve carbon neutrality."

However, the role of the catalyst’s coordination sphere in regulating the reaction mechanism remains ambiguous. Here, we elucidate this structure–reactivity relationship by deploying three iron porphyrins with strategically varied ligand substitutions to activate H2O2 for bisphenol A (BPA) degradation. We demonstrate that the ligand coordination of the catalyst directs the nature of the generated FeIV-oxo species, the identity of the cogenerated radicals, and the pollutant degradation pathways. Specifically, the β-substituted catalyst exclusively generates the FeIV═O unit with a ligand π-cation radical, transforming BPA to hydroxylation products via an oxygen adduct formation pathway with strong matrix tolerance. Conversely, meso-substituted catalysts generate protonated FeIV–OH species and coexisting oxygen-centered radicals. Meso-carboxyl substitution yields (por)FeIV–OH and HO•, which synergistically induce ring cleavage of BPA through a single-electron-transfer (SET)-initiated attack. Meso-sulfoxyl substitution produces [(por)FeIV–OH]+ and HO2•, which drive quinonization of BPA via a coupled SET and hydrogen-atom-abstraction mechanism. These findings reveal that the coordination environment of the catalyst critically modulates the protonation state and reactivity of the generated high-valent iron-oxo species, thereby steering pollutant degradation toward pathway-selective transformations. This work provides fundamental mechanistic insights into the targeted detoxification of organic compounds."

The prioritization includes 1) mass defect (MD) analysis, 2) isotope patterns, 3) characteristic fragments, 4) construction of MS characteristics through chemical reactions, and 5) intermolecular connectivity MS characteristics mining. Subsequently, we provided an overview of the mining and prediction of MS characteristics based on machine learning.

In this Letter, we present fully resolved multiphase simulations of gravity‐driven flow over a fully submerged vegetated bed, capturing the coupled dynamics of air, water, and individual plant stems, under quasi‐realistic conditions (the air/water viscosity ratio is real, while the density ratio is reduced tenfold). Our results show that vegetation submerged for four times its height regularizes the water surface suppressing strong deformations and homogenizing streamwise‐propagating wave fronts along the transversal direction. Despite these alterations, the equivalent roughness perceived by the overlying air flow remains unchanged. These findings clarify vegetation–surface interactions and provide quantitative insights for nature‐based wave mitigation strategies and atmospheric boundary‐layer modeling."

Here, we use a year‐round North American regime classification to identify summertime circulation trends from 1981 to 2024. We find large increases in the frequency, persistence and interannual variability of the Greenland High (GH) regime, similar to Greenland blocking. A simple Markov model shows that the observed increased GH frequency and variability can arise from increased persistence. We then show that a 10,000‐member ensemble using SEAS5 seasonal model data fails to capture the observed trend in GH frequency because persistence trends are too weak. This occurs despite SEAS5 producing summers with more GH days and individual regimes more persistent than observed, so the issue is not simply an overall lack of persistence. Hence, the missing trends must arise from fundamental model deficiencies which develop on subseasonal timescales and are not rectified by initialization."

Currently, no direct approaches exist to estimate δ from observational data of deep convective clouds (DCCs), hindering the characterization of detrainment processes in DCCs. To fill this gap, this study proposes a new precipitation efficiency‐based (PE‐based) approach for simultaneously estimating ε and δ in DCCs by introducing precipitation efficiency in the conservation equation of total water, thereby addressing the nonconservation of total water in precipitating DCCs. Evaluation using numerical simulations shows that the PE‐based approach yields ε and δ with magnitudes and vertical variations comparable with those estimated using the bulk‐plume approach, confirming its reliability. Sensitivity tests reveal that the variations of presumed entrained air properties have minimal impact on estimated ε and δ. Increasing the fraction of in‐cloud air in the presumed detrained air leads to larger δ values, while ε remains largely unaffected. Higher precipitation efficiency increases both ε and δ estimates, with a more pronounced effect on δ. Further comparisons between the PE‐based and bulk‐plume approaches identify the optimal precipitation efficiency for accurate estimation. Finally, the application of the PE‐based approach to aircraft observations of DCCs reveals that δ is greater than ε. The proposed approach can be applied to DCC observations to derive ε and δ data sets, ultimately contributing to advancements in parameterizations for DCCs."

The Added Value of a High‐Top Model, UA‐ICON","Infrasound monitoring activities that deal with long‐range acoustic propagation, as within the Comprehensive Nuclear‐Test‐Ban Treaty's (CTBT), need accurate and operational modeling of the atmosphere up to the lower thermosphere. Yet, operational meteorological products issued by weather services are topped at around 80 km altitude with a sponge layer starting in the stratosphere. This prevents reliable simulation of atmospheric dynamics where infrasound waveguides form. Hence, investigating higher‐top atmospheric models enabling simulations at typical operational horizontal resolutions (∼10 ${\sim} 10$ km) are of high interest to improve the description of the propagation medium, which is needed to localize and characterizes acoustic sources of interest. The extension of the ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model to the upper‐atmosphere, UA‐ICON with a model top of 150 km, is run at the ICON operational horizontal resolution. Simulations are compared with LiDAR observations at three different sites and with operational analyses. We demonstrate the better performance of the UA‐ICON simulations compared to operational models in the mesosphere, especially for the temperature field while it is less clear for the winds. This is achieved by tuning the nonorographic gravity wave (GW) parameterization coefficient that drives the saturation and breaking of the waves. Additionally, infrasound propagation simulations are performed using UA‐ICON atmospheric specifications. For the two case studies, one at high latitudes and one in tropical regions, we demonstrate the added value of the UA‐ICON with a tuned GW parameterization, while also illustrating how infrasound can contribute to model validation and tuning in the upper‐atmosphere."

By 2100, MMM inter‐basin contrasts strengthen, with freshening in the tropical Indian Ocean (TIO) and equatorial‐northern Pacific (ENPO), and saltening in the southern Pacific (SPO) and tropical Atlantic (TAO). Basin‐scale future SSS changes are primarily driven by surface freshwater fluxes, with lateral advection redistributing anomalies within each basin. Precipitation dominates the freshwater flux changes, except in the tropical Atlantic where evaporation plays a key role. Two uncorrelated indices, contrasting SPO versus TIO and TAO versus ENPO, explain 76% of the variance across models. Physically, stronger relative warming of the Northern Hemisphere enhances rainfall over the TIO monsoon region (freshening) while suppressing rainfall along the South Pacific Convergence Zone (saltening). The increasing TAO–ENPO contrast arises from two distinct mechanisms: in the Pacific, an enhanced El Niño–like warming pattern reduces atmospheric stability, intensifying rainfall and freshening ENPO; in the Atlantic, saltening reflects stronger evaporation under warmer conditions, though at a weaker rate than predicted by Clausius–Clapeyron scaling (∼ ${\sim} $4.2 vs. ∼ ${\sim} $7% K−1 ${\mathrm{K}}^{-1}$). Previous studies linked strengthening of inter‐basin salinity gradients to a thermodynamically intensified hydrological cycle. Our analysis highlights a more nuanced picture: Atlantic saltening reflects this thermodynamic control, while SSS changes elsewhere are mainly driven by atmospheric circulation and rainfall changes tied to uneven SST warming. The CMIP6 statistical analyses highlight dynamical mechanisms that motivate further testing through targeted ocean simulations."

 The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) is the leading mode of North Pacific climate variability, yet its response to climate change remains uncertain. Here, we use Linear Inverse Model (LIM) diagnostics to decompose PDO into three dynamical constituents: the Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension (KOE) mode, the North Pacific–Central Tropical Pacific (NP-CP) mode, and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) mode. Applying an observationally derived LIM large ensemble, we show that the relative importance of these modes varies substantially over 85-year periods due to internal climate variability—requiring at least 300 years for stationary estimates. LIMs trained on climate model ensembles reveal that, despite comparable variability, models exhibit systematic biases in representing the spatial structures of the KOE and NP-CP modes. Under global warming, models project a more dominant ENSO contribution and a diminished KOE influence, leading to a shortened PDO timescale. This LIM-based dynamical decomposition enables more direct comparisons of PDO mechanisms between models and observations."

Here, PM2.5 samples from the combustion of ten biomass types were collected, and 102 chemical components were analyzed. Results indicated that the mass fractions of K⁺, K, and levoglucosan (LEV) varied in 0.1%–8.4% (2.4 ± 2.2%), 0.1%–14.1% (3.2 ± 3.1%), and 0.1%–4.9% (2.1 ± 1.4%).

Ten widely used specific species ratios in literatures cannot effectively distinguish sub-types of BB due to the value overlap. A k-means identified LEV and fatty acid (C16:0) as the common markers for the ten sub-types of BB. C16:0 was firstly proposed and verified as a marker for BB here.

 Impact-generated shock waves can modify the remanent magnetization preserved in target rocks, yet their effects remain poorly constrained. Here we examine how shock waves modify rock magnetization by analysing unshocked granitoids and diorites, and shock-affected monomict breccia and impact melt rock of the Paleoproterozoic Dhala impact structure in India. Microscopic, thermomagnetic and hysteresis analyses were used to identify magnetic minerals and their domain states. Remanent magnetization and demagnetization experiments were performed to evaluate shock effects on the palaeomagnetic behaviour of impact-generated and unshocked target rocks. The unshocked rocks contain strong and stable magnetization carried by titanomagnetite. In contrast, the monomict breccia carries titanomagnetite and titanohematite and shows extremely weak and unstable magnetization, consistent with shock-related grain-size reduction and microfracturing. Impact melt rocks display intermediate behaviour, with titanomagnetite, titanohematite and pyrrhotite as magnetic carriers. These results show that shock can substantially reduce crustal magnetization. The results help to explain weak magnetic signatures at terrestrial and planetary impact structures, even in the presence of an ambient magnetic field.

 Changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, climate, and land management influence the abundance and distribution of C3 and C4 plants, yet their impact on the global carbon cycle remains uncertain. Here, we use a parsimonious model of C3 and C4 plant distribution, based on optimality principles, combined with a simplified representation of the global carbon cycle, to assess how shifts in plant abundances driven by carbon dioxide and climate affect global gross primary production, land carbon isotope discrimination, and the isotopic composition of atmospheric carbon dioxide. We estimate that the proportion of C4 plants in total biomass declined from about 16% to 12% between 1982 and 2016, despite an increase in the abundance of C4 crops. This decline reflects the reduced competitive advantage of C4 photosynthesis in a carbon dioxide-enriched atmosphere. As a result, global gross primary production rose by approximately 16.5 ± 1.8 petagrams of carbon, and land carbon isotope discrimination increased by 0.017 ± 0.001‰ per year. Accounting for changes in C3 and C4 abundances reduces the difference between observed and modeled trends in atmospheric carbon isotope composition, but does not fully explain the observed decrease, pointing to additional, unaccounted drivers.

 Storm-induced waves threaten ship traffic and offshore infrastructures, yet observing water surfaces remains challenging because of complex air-water interactions and limited spatial coverage. We used distributed acoustic sensing measurements from a telecom fiber-optic cable in Lake Ontario, one of the world’s largest lakes, to analyze wind-wave evolution at tens-of-meter scales along a 43-km-long array. By combining observations and modeling, we found that chaotic waves induced by local wind forcing and wave-wave interactions generate high-frequency microseisms (1–4 Hz), whereas frequency variations in low-frequency microseisms (0.2–1 Hz) are strongly controlled by wind speed and fetch evolution. We tracked changes in frequency and energy throughout the full life cycle of wind waves, from chaotic conditions to organized gravity waves formed under steady winds, followed by dissipation as fetch decreases. These results are particularly relevant for fetch-limited water bodies and highlight the potential of distributed acoustic sensing for real-time monitoring of wind waves, with implications for coastal hazards, ecosystem dynamics, and wave-energy development.

 Despite the widespread presence of americium in the environment since the 1950s from nuclear activities, the use of americium isotopic composition to trace contamination sources has not been investigated. Here we report the detection of 243Am in environmental samples and demonstrate that the ratio of 243Am to 241Am can serve as a distinctive fingerprint of radioactive emissions, with characteristic values of 0.05 for thermonuclear explosions, 0.023 for global fallout, below 0.0015 for low-yield nuclear tests, and 0.0013 for releases from a nuclear reprocessing facility.

 September 2023 featured an unprecedented temperature jump of nearly 0.6 °C above September 2022. Although climate models hardly reproduce such an event, it remains unclear whether the extreme heat could have been caused by internal variability alone or how large an external contribution would be needed to render it plausible. Here we show, based on observational and climate model data, that the temperature jump was virtually impossible under standard anthropogenic forcing, but its probability increases to 0.1% when probabilistic attribution is combined with a process-based analysis to account for contributions that models may underrepresent. Our findings reveal that the heat was disproportionately concentrated over land, particularly in the extratropics. The event resulted from a complex interplay of feedbacks and forcings, with unusually high shortwave forcing amplified by water vapour feedback. Although extreme temperature jumps in September are projected to intensify gradually under additional warming, an internally driven jump of comparable magnitude remains highly unlikely during the next decades. The jump in global heat in September 2023 was unprecedented, with factors such as increased water vapour and shortwave radiation contributing to the increased heat, according to reanalysis data and climate model simulations."

 Severe wildfire seasons in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) raise questions regarding long-term fire dynamics and their drivers. However, data on long-term fire history remains scarce across eastern Siberia. Here we present a composite of reconstructed wildfire dynamics in Yakutia throughout the Holocene, based on eight newly contributed records of macroscopic charcoal in lake sediments in combination with published data. Increased biomass burning occurred in the Early Holocene, c. 10,000 years BP, before shifting to lower levels at c. 6000 years BP. Independent simulations of climate-driven burned area in an individual-based forest model reproduce this reconstructed Holocene trend, but the correlation on multi-centennial timescales turns negative in the Late Holocene. This mismatch suggests that climate alone cannot explain Late Holocene wildfire dynamics. We propose that a human dimension needs to be considered. By example of the settlement of the pastoralist Sakha people c. 800 years BP, we show that implementing reduced fuel availability from Indigenous land management in the forest model leads to increased multi-centennial-scale correlations. This study highlights the need for a better understanding of the poorly reported human dimension of past fire dynamics in eastern Siberia. In eastern Siberia, climate alone cannot explain Late Holocene wildfire dynamics, and human activity is a potential driver of shorter, multi-centennial-scale variability of wildfire since c. 5000 years BP, based on palaeoecological records and data model comparisons."

 Landslide-dammed lakes (LDL) and landslide lake outburst flood (LLOF) can significantly alter the kinematic behavior of upstream and downstream landslides, posing severe threats to human life and infrastructure. However, the long-term impacts of LDL and LLOF on surrounding landslide stability remain poorly understood. In this study, we systematically examine the cascading effects triggered by the 2018 Baige LDL and LLOF on adjacent landslides, based on time series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) analysis of 1437 satellite radar images. Unlike previous studies that focused on individual landslides or localized areas, we developed an automated method to detect the onset of landslide acceleration, leading to the establishment of an inventory of 65 accelerated landslides (ALs) and a quantitative evaluation of their controlling factors. Our results show that approximately 30 % of the flood-affected active landslides changed their deformation mechanisms, which can be categorized into five distinct types. Among the landslides accelerated by the Baige event, 43 % exhibited persistent acceleration, whereas 57 % showed signs of self-recovery. For the latter, deformation velocity typically decayed by 90 % within an average of 9.3 years after the outburst, returning to near pre-event levels. Furthermore, compared to 378 flood-involved but non-ALs, ALs preferentially occur on gentler slopes and in areas with lower vegetation cover. More notably, those ALs generally experienced greater flood depth, higher flow velocity, and stronger flood power. This study is the first to assess the long-lasting cascading effects of LDL and LLOF on creep landslides. These findings advance our understanding of LDL and LLOF-induced landslide mechanisms and offer valuable insights for the long-term risk assessment and geohazard mitigation of landslide-prone regions affected by similar cascading processes."

 This study maps forest structural diversity, a key component of ecosystem diversity, using NASA's GEDI spaceborne lidar, providing new opportunities to support conservation and restoration efforts. Focusing on biodiversity hotspots in Central Africa and the Western US, we evaluated GEDI's ability to capture spatial variation in forest canopy structure by comparing GEDI-derived metrics with 391 km2 of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. Forest structural traits were assessed at 1 km2 resolution, with GEDI showing robust correlations with ALS, particularly in dense and flat Central African forests (r2 up to 0.85), and moderate agreement in more heterogeneous terrain in the California Sierra Nevada (r2 up to 0.55). We quantified structural diversity as horizontal variation in canopy structure using a probability density-based multivariate diversity framework. GEDI canopy height (rh98), canopy cover, and foliage height diversity jointly captured independent axes of canopy variation and explained structural diversity derived from wall-to-wall ALS (r2 = 0.37 at 1 km2). Resulting maps reveal high structural diversity in mid-elevation and coastal forests of the Western US and in forest-savanna transitions and volcanic ranges of Central Africa, consistent with gradients in disturbance, topography and aridity. Despite limitations related to sampling density, waveform noise and terrain complexity, this study demonstrates that GEDI's footprint-level metrics can be used directly to quantify forest structural diversity. These findings highlight the potential of spaceborne lidar to provide scalable, trait-based structural diversity indicators, while emphasizing that interpretation remains context dependent and benefits from integration with ecological data, environmental drivers and disturbance regimes."

 Cloud detection is crucial in many applications of satellite remote sensing data. Traditional cloud detection methods typically operate at the pixel level, relying on empirically tuned thresholds or, more recently, machine learning classification schemes based on training datasets. Motivated by the success of the Transformer with its self-attention mechanism and convolutional neural networks for enhanced feature extraction, we propose a new encoder-decoder method that captures global and regional contexts with multi-scale features. This new model takes advantage of two advanced deep-learning techniques, the Swin Transformer and UPerNet (named STUPmask), demonstrating improved cloud detection accuracy and strong adaptability to diverse imagery types, spanning spectral bands from visible to thermal infrared and spatial resolutions from meters to kilometers, across a wide range of surface types, including bright scenes such as ice and desert, globally. Training and validation of the STUPmask model are conducted using data obtained from the Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 Manually Cloud Validation Mask datasets on a global scale. STUPmask accurately estimates cloud amount with a marginal difference against reference masks (0.27 % for Landsat 8 and −0.81 % for Sentinel-2). Additionally, the model captures cloud distribution with a high overall classification accuracy (97.51 % for Landsat 8 and 96.27 % for Sentinel-2). Notably, it excels in detecting broken, thin, and semi-transparent clouds across diverse surfaces, including bright surfaces like urban and barren lands, especially with acceptable accuracy over snow and ice. These encompass the majority of challenging scenes encountered by cloud identification methods. It also adapts to cross-sensor satellite data with varying spatial resolutions (4 m–2 km) from both Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) and Geostationary-Earth-Orbit (GEO) platforms (including GaoFen-2, MODIS, and Himawari-8), with an overall accuracy of 94.21–97.11 %. The demonstrated successes in the automatic identification of clouds with a variety of satellite imagery of different spectral channels and spatial resolutions render the method versatile for a wide range of remote sensing studies."

 As the Arctic warms, surface melt extends into the Greenland Ice Sheet's accumulation zone, where much of the water infiltrates into the snowpack. This makes monitoring the subsurface water depth and spatial extent important for accurate ice sheet runoff estimations. Subsurface water can be detected using remotely sensed microwave brightness temperatures (TB). We use vertically polarized TB at 1.4 GHz from Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite (SMOS) and at 6.9, 10.7, and 18.7 GHz from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometers (AMSR-E/2) to estimate the upper depth of liquid water (UDLW) on the ice sheet accumulation area. We build a catalogue of simulated UDLW and TB: realistic UDLW are modeled by the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS) snow model, forced by the Copernicus Arctic Regional Reanalysis (CARRA), and the corresponding TB are calculated by the Snow Microwave Radiative Transfer (SMRT) model at 19 sites. We train on this catalogue an ensemble of cross-validated Random Forest (RF) models to predict UDLW and its uncertainty from TB at four frequencies. On hold-out modeled data and for water within 5 m of the surface, the RF ensemble achieves a median RMSE of 0.68 m and mean error of −0.09 m. Our retrieval, when applied to observed TB, matches within 2 m UDLW inferred from subsurface temperature profiles down to 4–6 m depth. Performances decrease beyond 5 m depth and for low liquid water amounts. Our retrieval produces daily UDLW maps over the ice sheet's accumulation area during 2010–2023 which reveal the seasonal evolution of UDLW, deliver the first quantitative estimates of subsurface liquid water depth on the ice sheet and offer new insights into meltwater infiltration and storage processes."

 Climate change and population growth intensify the demand for precise agriculture mapping to enhance food security. Such mapping tasks require robust modeling of multi-scale spatiotemporal patterns from fine field textures to landscape context, and from short-term phenology to full growing-season dynamics. Existing methods often process spatial and temporal features separately, limiting their ability to capture essential agricultural dynamics. While transformer-based remote sensing foundation models (RSFMs) offer unified spatiotemporal modeling ability, most of them remain suboptimal: they either use fixed windows that ignore multi-scale crop characteristics or neglect temporal information entirely. To address these gaps, we propose AgriFM, a multi-source, multi-temporal foundation model for agriculture mapping. AgriFM introduces a synchronized spatiotemporal downsampling strategy within a Video Swin Transformer backbone, enabling efficient handling of long and variable-length satellite time series while preserving multi-scale spatial and phenological information. It is pre-trained on a globally representative dataset comprising over 25 million samples from MODIS, Landsat-8/9, and Sentinel-2 with land cover fractions as pre-training supervision. AgriFM further integrates a versatile decoder specifically designed to dynamically fuse multi-source features from different stages of backbone and accommodate varying temporal lengths, thereby supporting consistent and scalable agriculture mapping across diverse satellite sources and task requirements. It supports diverse tasks including agricultural land mapping, field boundary delineation, agricultural land use/land cover mapping, and specific crop mapping (e.g., winter wheat and paddy rice) with different data sources. Comprehensive evaluations show that AgriFM consistently outperforms existing deep learning models and general-purpose RSFMs across multiple agriculture mapping tasks.

 Forest fires pose a significant threat to ecosystems, biodiversity, and human settlements. This study focuses on the Arsin Forest Sub-district Directorate, located in Trabzon, Türkiye, with the aim of developing wildfire susceptibility maps using machine learning techniques. To improve the completeness of the wildfire inventory dataset, official fire records from 2013 to 2022 were integrated with active fire pixel data obtained from the Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) for the period 2001–2012. Five machine learning models Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Deep Neural Network (DNN) were employed to generate susceptibility maps. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curves, and AUC-ROC metrics. Seventeen wildfire conditioning factors, categorized into four groups (topographic, meteorological, stand-related, and anthropogenic), were used to assess fire risk. Unlike previous studies, this research incorporates a region-specific anthropogenic variable: proximity to hazelnut cultivation. Feature importance scores were computed to determine the influence of each factor on fire occurrence. Additionally, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), accompanied by graphical analysis, were used to interpret the relationships between predictors and fire events. Areas of very high fire susceptibility covering 4.62% and 4.86% of the study area were identified by the RF and GBM models, both achieving an accuracy of 0.98."

 Forest attribute maps are essential for supporting local decision-making regarding forest resource use. Such maps are produced by combining remote sensing and field data through various modeling approaches. When mapping across large areas, spatial gaps in field data used for model training are common. Our study evaluates the performance of three methods—k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Random Forests (RF), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)—for forest resource mapping across Norway, Sweden, and Finland in an experimental setup with respect to availability of field data around the target area. Models were trained with sample plot sizes (N) ranging from 100 to 3000. RF consistently produced the most accurate predictions in terms of relative bias and RMSE. While spatial gaps in the training data (radius: 7–141 km) affected %RMSE of broad-leaved above ground biomass (AGB), they had minimal impact on %RMSE of both local and country-level predictions of total AGB and volume. For RF with N=3000, %RMSE of total AGB ranged between 53%–55% in Finland and Sweden, and 70%–72% in Norway across gap sizes. However, %bias increased for local predictions across the whole study region with larger gaps: RF with N=500 showed bias of −12%–12% (7 km gap) and −17%–28% (78 km gap). Similarly, country-level %bias of total AGB for Norway increased from −1.7% to −3.7% with larger gaps. In conclusion, spatial gaps in training data can significantly affect bias in predictions. Therefore, forest attribute maps should always be accompanied by metadata describing the training data used."

 The impact of emissions from large urban centers on atmospheric chemistry and regional climate is a central issue in atmospheric sciences. This study uses WRF-Chem and GoAmazon2014/5 data to assess how urban and forest emissions interact to influence cloud properties in the Amazon. The region around Manaus, in the central Amazon, provides a unique environment for this study worldwide. During the wet season, clean air masses transported by trade winds interact with urban emissions, altering the atmosphere's chemical composition and impacting clouds microphysical and radiative properties. The interaction between urban emissions from Manaus and emissions from the Amazon rainforest modulates aerosol concentration and size. Polluted clouds exhibit a smaller effective radius (De), while liquid water content (LWC) and cloud droplet number concentration (DNC) are higher. In background areas, the DNC is approximately 50 cm−3 and exceeds 150 cm−3 under highly polluted conditions. The higher LWC observed in polluted clouds is associated with the increased DNC, while the smaller De may delay the onset of rainfall. The amount of water vapor available in the atmosphere and the level of supersaturation determine how urban emissions influence the microphysical processes of cloud formation. Under low LWC conditions, warm precipitation is suppressed, while for high LWC (above 0.75 g m−3), the De increases until reaching levels associated with precipitation. These results highlight that the spatial and temporal variation in CCN concentration, modulated by the interaction between urban emissions and those from the tropical rainforest, plays a significant role in cloud microphysical processes in the central Amazon."

 Differences in black carbon (BC) emissions and diverse climate zones in China result in significant spatial heterogeneity of BC levels. Understanding the roles of emissions, meteorological conditions, and other factors in BC variation is important for mitigating its adverse effects. This study conducted synchronous observations of BC in Changchun (CC), Tianjin (TJ), Wuhan (WH), and Guangzhou (GZ) during winter. Results showed that BC levels were highest in WH compared to the other cities (p < 0.001). Simulations using the Flexible Particle Dispersion (FLEXPART) model and BC emission inventories quantified the contributions from local transport and different sectors. Results indicated that local emissions were the dominant geographical source of observed BC levels at all four sites. BC from residential, commercial, and other sectors was the dominant source in TJ, WH, and GZ. Using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method, emissions were identified as the predominant factor influencing BC variation at the four sites. While changes in meteorological conditions were the most influential factor contributing to BC concentration increases as air quality worsened from clean to polluted in CC, TJ, and WH. Regarding the impacts of features on model outputs, emissions showed a linear relationship with simulated BC, while the effects of transport and meteorological conditions exhibited spatial heterogeneity. This study highlights the need for continuous reduction of BC emissions to decrease ambient BC levels, and this recommendation can be extended to other parts of the country."

Feature importance analysis highlighted SRI, relative humidity, and ambient temperature as the most influential variables, contributing normalized importances of 28%, 17%, and 10%. Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) indicated that higher SRI and lower relative humidity were critical in promoting NPF formation at SGP. Seasonally, NPF events were more frequent in winter (42.1%) and spring (35.5%), and least in summer (4.0%). Particle growth rates also exhibited a seasonal variation, with the lowest in winter (below 2 nm hr−1) and highest in late spring and early summer (exceeding 5 nm hr−1).

Previous studies using hierarchical clustering on atmospheric model output have been limited to small domain sizes (roughly 100 × 100 grid cells) by the computational expense and memory requirements of the algorithm. Here we present a scalable hierarchical clustering implementation that we apply to two year‐long, hourly atmospheric data sets: model concentration and deposition timeseries at 290,520 locations over Alberta and Saskatchewan (538 × ${\times} $ 540 grid); and 366,427 multi‐pollutant observations from 51 national air pollution surveillance stations located across Canada. When combined with other information such as emissions source locations, orography, and prevailing meteorological conditions, the method yields coherent, interpretable structures. In the case of model time series, the clustering provides regions of similar air quality (airsheds) which can be used to inform air quality monitoring network placement, or regions of similar deposition which can inform critical load assessment as well as monitoring site locations. In the case of the multi‐pollutant observations, we show that a single low‐primary pollutant cluster appears the most frequently at all but one of 51 stations across Canada, accounting for 62% of all station‐hours, while elevated SO2 appears in factor profiles at certain monitoring locations near industrial and shipping activity. Together, these results demonstrate that hierarchical clustering can efficiently summarize patterns relevant to airshed mapping and source apportionment at previously unreachable scales."

 Tidal flat topography is a fundamental attribute affecting inundation dynamics, sediment transport, and ecosystem functioning, yet accurate and spatially consistent large-scale monitoring remains challenging. Here, we leveraged satellite altimetry from the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission to develop a novel, large-scale framework for deriving tidal flat topography from SWOT data, and demonstrated its capability by generating a high-accuracy, national-scale elevation dataset for China. By combining a percentile-based aggregation of multi-temporal water-surface elevation observations with a tide-constrained, adaptive best-quantile (best-q) reconstruction strategy, followed by linear interpolation for gap filling, we improved both vertical accuracy and spatial completeness. Validation against airborne LiDAR, GNSS-RTK surveys, and ICESat-2 photon data demonstrates robust performance across diverse coastal settings, achieving RMSE = 0.34–0.47 m and R2 = 0.81–0.88 at a horizontal resolution of 100 m. Compared with existing large-scale digital elevation models (DEMs), the SWOT-derived topography not only improves vertical accuracy by over 80% but also providing substantially more complete spatial coverage of tidal flat elevations. Spatial analyses reveal pronounced latitudinal gradients, with higher tidal flats concentrated in low-latitude regions and extensive low-lying flats dominating northern estuarine and deltaic systems.

 To enhance ecosystem functioning and terrestrial carbon sink capacity, the Chinese government has implemented a series of regional ecological projects. However, the effectiveness of ecological projects varies considerably due to regional climate differences and diverse implementation strategies. This study analyzed long-term time series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) from 1982 to 2018 across eight Forestry Ecological Engineering Projects (FEEPs) and is the first to combine Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) with a modified residual trend analysis to quantify the contributions of these projects to vegetation greenness and productivity. The results indicate that both NDVI and GPP exhibited overall increasing trends in FEEP regions, although GPP exhibited lower magnitude and stability (with a monotonically increasing of about 35 % of pixels) than NDVI (with a monotonically increasing of about 54 % of pixels). GPP was more sensitive to environmental changes, with the proportions of pixels significantly correlated with temperature, precipitation, and sunlight being 74.0 %, 59.0 %, and 55.3 %, respectively, higher than the corresponding values for NDVI (68.6 %, 54.8 %, and 49.2 %). NDVI trend turning points were closely related to the timing of FEEP implementation, whereas GPP turning points showed weaker correlations. Our analysis indicates that FEEPs are the primary driver of NDVI increases, effectively mitigating the negative impacts of climate change on vegetation greenness, while GPP is mainly controlled by climate, with engineering measures insufficient to offset the long-term negative effects of extreme climate events. This study highlights the complex responses of vegetation to environmental changes and the potential vulnerability of ecosystem carbon sequestration under climate change."

 Nitrogenous organic compounds are increasingly garnering attention in the atmospheric environment and climate research due to their significant influence on the formation of secondary organic aerosol. New particle formation (NPF) is an essential source of aerosol formation. Ambient observations and theoretical calculations have demonstrated that Glycine (Gly), one of the most important organic nitrogen compounds, can enhance sulfuric acid (SA)-dominated NPF in metropolis environments. With the global reduction in SA levels due to stricter SO2 emission controls, nucleation driven by methanesulfonic acid (MSA) and methylamine (MA) has gained significant attention. However, the underlying mechanisms and the impact of Gly on MSA-MA clusters formation under varying atmospheric conditions remain poorly ambiguous. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) in conjunction with the Atmospheric Clusters Dynamic Code (ACDC) simulations, were employed to investigate the formation of (MSA)x·(MA)y·(Gly)z (y ≤ x + z ≤ 3) clusters. The findings revealed that Gly can significantly boost the formation rates of MSA-MA nucleation by up to 6 orders of magnitude, particularly in polluted atmospheric boundary layers with MSA concentrations approximating 108 molecules·cm−3. Simultaneously, in regions with low temperatures, high [Gly] (109 molecules·cm−3), [MA] (2.5 × 109 molecules·cm−3) and low [MSA] (106 molecules·cm−3), Gly-inclusive clusters contribute up to 18 %. Notably, the NPF mechanism indicates that Gly enhances the development of initial clusters via a catalytic effect and is directly involved in the growth of pivotal clusters. This finding is corroborated by the traced cluster formation pathways observed in highly polluted megacities with winter. This research endeavors to offer a deeper comprehension of previously unidentified sources of NPF in the pollution areas and aid in constructing a more detailed multi-species nucleation model tailored for such regions."

 Near-surface nitrogen dioxide (NO2) plays a critical role in the formation of acid rain, photochemical smog, and aerosol particles, posing serious risks to public health. Polar-orbiting satellites are conventionally used for large-scale monitoring of NO2. However, satellite-based NO2 retrieval techniques predominantly rely on gas absorption within the ultraviolet and visible spectral regions, and thus are unable to capture nighttime NO2 concentrations. Moreover, deriving NO2 values in regions blurred by cloud cover or data missing remains a significant unresolved challenge, further complicating efforts to achieve spatially and temporally consistent atmospheric analyses. This study utilizes the thermal infrared absorption band of NO2 from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) aboard Himawari-8, alongside various auxiliary datasets, to estimate both diurnal and nocturnal near-surface NO2 concentrations across central and eastern China. To address data missing caused by cloud coverage, a NO2 inpainting algorithm based on satellite-ground data fusion is proposed. Three kinds of 5-fold cross-validation demonstrate strong agreement between derived NO2 estimates and in-situ measurements, achieving R2 up to 0.85. The retrieval data reveal significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity in ground NO2 levels across China. Urban centers, particularly large metropolitan areas, display a distinct ""urban island effect"". Diurnal patterns show two distinct peaks around 09:00 and 20:00 local time. Seasonal fluctuations are also evident, with summer recording the lowest NO2 concentration and winter showing the highest. This study offers new insights into hourly dissolved 24-h cycle surface NO2 dynamics, potentially advancing real-time pollution monitoring and public health protection."

 The processes on Tropical cyclones' (TCs) looping tracks (LTs) near an isolated terrain are investigated with numerical simulations. The large-scale environmental fields of observed TCs approaching Taiwan Island with and without LTs are compared. LT cases exhibit a monsoon gyre (MG)-like circulation on the southeast side of the TC, in contrast to the non-looping cases. This circulation serves as a key background difference of the two types of TC motions. Idealized simulations show that when a TC approaches the island's topography from the east, the channeling effect enhances the northerly flow, accelerating the TC southward. Meanwhile, the MG is blocked by the topography, preventing it from merging with the TC as it does in the absence of topography, contributing to a separation between their centers. As a result, the westerly flow from the southern flank of MG can subsequently steer the TC. Thereafter, the merger of MG and TC circulation completes the LT. In contrast, a TC in the absence of either an MG or topography only exhibits a southward or northward deflection, without undergoing a LT. This study highlights the interactions among the TC, MG and topography may induce unusual TC tracks."

 Air pollution is strongly linked to local and synoptic-scale atmospheric conditions, and tropical cyclones (TCs) are recognized as high-wind systems that facilitate pollutant scavenging. A key question is whether TC-triggered Rossby wave trains exert direct or remote indirect influences on pollutant concentrations. Using multi-source reanalysis datasets, this study examined the dynamic impacts of the Rossby wave trains from two successive TCs in 2023 (Doksuri, TC1; Khanun, TC2) on central China's pollutant concentrations. Results showed a prominent Rossby wave train was excited by TC1; its alternating anticyclone (A) - cyclone (C) structure drove periodic high-low pressure oscillations in the study area. Pollutant concentrations correlated with wave train phases: cyclonic phases (TC1/TC2/C1) brought strong ascent, enhanced winds, and precipitation, reducing PM2.5 and CO rapidly; anticyclonic phases (A0/A1/A2) caused subsidence and weak winds, worsening diffusion and increasing pollutants. TC1 directly affected local pollution by passing through the area. TC2 propagated northward over the ocean with no direct impact on the study area, but its wave train blocked mid-latitude energy transport, forcing mid-latitude high-pressure energy southward and inducing secondary pollution. This study is the first to quantify TC-Rossby wave train effects on pollutant diffusion (direct/indirect), providing a novel perspective for TC-air pollution links."

Mitchell,Constraining a Radiative Transfer Model with Satellite Retrievals: Contrasts between cirrus formed via homogeneous and heterogeneous freezing and their implications for cirrus cloud thinning,"Cirrus clouds play a key role in Earth’s climate by trapping heat. Using satellite observations and radiative transfer modeling, we examined how thinning these clouds might help cool the planet. We find that natural homogeneous and heterogeneous cirrus have distinct radiative effects, and that the instantaneous impact of cirrus cloud thinning can lead to either cooling or warming, depending on atmospheric dynamics. These insights help guide future studies of cirrus clouds using climate models. 
 The efficacy of the climate intervention method known as cirrus cloud thinning (CCT) is difficult to evaluate in climate models, largely due to uncertainties governing the relative contributions of homogeneous and heterogeneous ice nucleation. Here we take a different approach by employing recent satellite retrievals from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) which provide estimates of the fraction of cirrus clouds dominated by homogeneous and heterogeneous ice nucleation and their associated physical properties. We employ a radiative transfer model (RTM) to quantify the cloud radiative effect for homogeneous and heterogeneous cirrus clouds at the top of atmosphere (TOA), Earth's surface, and within the atmosphere. The RTM experiments are initialized using cirrus microphysical profiles derived from CALIPSO retrievals for cirrus clouds dominated by homogeneous and heterogeneous ice nucleation across different regions (Arctic, Antarctic, and midlatitude) and surface types (ocean and land). We define two bounds: the lower bound assumes a full microphysical transition from the observed composition of homogeneous- and heterogeneous-dominated cirrus to only heterogeneous cirrus and production of new cirrus. The upper bound assumes production of new cirrus and that the atmospheric dynamics enables homogeneous freezing nucleation to occur regardless of the concentration of ice nucleating particles. Based on these bounds, we estimate an instantaneous surface effect ranging from −0.5 to +0.6 W m−2 and a TOA effect from −0.9 to +1.1 W m−2, respectively, showing the possibility of both cooling and warming. Recommendations are provided to improve the treatment of cirrus clouds in climate models."

We estimated carbon dioxide emissions in Zurich and Paris over one year by combining atmospheric observations with mesoscale model simulations. Our study shows how factors like city size, terrain, and measurement methods affect emission estimates. 
 Observation-based estimation of urban CO2 emissions can help cities track their pathway to net zero emissions, a goal many cities worldwide have adopted. While mesoscale atmospheric transport models are an effective component in inversion systems estimating country-level emissions, their use in urban-scale inversions presents a significant challenge. Here, we present one-year flux inversion results with the mesoscale ICON-ART atmospheric transport model for two cities with contrasting size and topographic complexity: Zurich and Paris. Inversions were performed with an ensemble square root filter, assimilating observations from a dense rooftop CO2 sensor network in Zurich and from a tall tower network in Paris. The inversion framework optimized gridded anthropogenic and biospheric fluxes, along with background mole fractions from eight inflow regions. Prior anthropogenic emissions were based on detailed inventories provided by local authorities. In Zurich, the inversion resulted in a posterior annual anthropogenic emission of 1012.3±38.8 kt yr−1, representing approximately a 30 % reduction compared to the prior, with the most significant decreases during winter periods of elevated ambient temperatures. In contrast, the posterior fluxes in Paris remained close to the prior, with an annual emission of 3580.0±101.9 kt yr−1, which is 7 % higher than the prior. This comparison highlights the influence of city-specific factors – such as topography, city size, and observational network – on the inversion system performance. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate the potential of mesoscale models to refine urban emission estimates, offering valuable insights for policymakers and researchers working to improve emission inventories and advance urban climate strategies."

This is the first approach to measure those emissions aircraft-based, to assess their magnitude and drivers. We identified emission hotspots and temporal changes in agricultural emissions in the Netherlands. Our approach is applicable to further greenhouse gas emitters, therefore it builds a step towards more comprehensive emission quantification. 
 This study reports on the first successful deployment of a new airborne eddy covariance (EC) setup to better characterize and quantify non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. The system was deployed aboard the DLR research aircraft Cessna Caravan to quantify growing-season emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in Friesland, an agricultural region in the Netherlands, in early summer 2023. The EC system consists of a commercial quantum cascade laser spectrometer, specifically adapted for airborne observations and providing 10 Hz data of N2O and CH4, and the meteorological measurement suite METPOD, delivering data of the vertical wind, horizontal winds, water vapor and temperature. Our measurements are a novelty for N2O, since they are the first implementation of quantifying agricultural emissions with airborne EC, combining the advantages of regional-scale coverage, while maintaining high spatial resolution and hence are well suited to capture the spatial complexity of this dominant emission sector. The system provides fluxes with minimal low- and high-frequency distortions, low detection limits, and total uncertainties (30 %–100 %) comparable to other airborne methods, despite the complexity of agricultural emissions. During measurements in Friesland, we identified clear N2O emission hotspots and hot-moments, with peak fluxes of 0.34  µg m−2 s−1 on the regional-scale after intensive precipitation following a relatively dry period. Single small-scale hotspot emissions were as high as 1 µg m−2 s−1 In contrast, CH4 fluxes showed less temporal variations around a mean flux of 1.62 µg m−2 s−1 throughout the three-week campaign. N2O emissions were relatively high compared to other agricultural regions worldwide, and preliminary comparisons with EDGAR v8.0 and the Dutch emission inventory Emissieregistratie suggest substantial underestimation of growing-season N2O emissions in current inventories and the lack of an appropriate annual cycle. Our results further document the urgent need for independent verification of reported N2O and CH4 emissions from agriculture, which is the most dominant anthropogenic sector of non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions and is expected to become even more dominant in the future, with an increasing world population and food demand."

 Global glacier mass loss is accelerating the formation and expansion of glacial lakes. These lakes store meltwater, contribute to enhanced glacier mass loss through positive feedback mechanisms, and in some cases can pose a risk to downstream populations, infrastructure, and ecosystems through glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Although satellite-derived inventories of glacial lakes exist at both global and regional scales, they vary in spatial and temporal resolution. Critically, fully automated and systematic monitoring of lake area changes is lacking, yet such monitoring is essential for detecting anomalous changes, estimating water storage, and understanding lake-glacier feedbacks. Here, we present a foundational dataset to support lake monitoring for the Glacial Lake Observatory (GLO), with an initial focus on lakes in Nepal and transboundary catchments. We trained a deep learning model to extract water bodies from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image mosaics from 2017 to 2024, subsequently classifying them as glacier-fed or non-glacier-fed based on their hydrological connectivity. In total, 18,389 and 22,419 individual lake outlines (≥ 0.001 km2) were mapped respectively from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery (2017–2024), resulting in 2,966 and 4,150 uniquely identified lakes (respectively). The number and total area of lakes increased over the eight-year period, driven largely by sustained expansion in the Koshi basin, which hosts about 61% of all mapped lakes and nine out of ten of the fastest expanding. On average, glacial lakes covered an average annual area of 169 km², with growth concentrated in high-elevation, glacier-fed systems. Validation against existing inventories and manually digitised outlines demonstrated good accuracy of our deep learning datasets (F1 scores = 0.80–0.92), with Sentinel-2 most reliably capturing smaller lakes.

In a sample of 4,537,418 term births, a 1 μg/m3 increase in wildfire PM2.5 during pregnancy was associated with increased odds of large for gestational age and an increase in birth weight, as well as moderately decreased odds of low birth weight and small for gestational age. These associations were more pronounced among Hispanic individuals and those in the Other race category. Conversely, among American Indian and Alaska Native births, exposure to wildfire PM2.5 was associated with decreased odds of large for gestational age.

In this study, we developed a novel, practical, and feasible framework for mechanistically correcting low-cost PM2.5 sensor measurements under high-humidity conditions by quantitatively separating aerosol liquid water mass (ALW) using the widely available EPA Chemical Speciation Network (CSN) data set, after accounting for the necessary optical calibration procedures that affect sensor performance at elevated RH. We introduced two key correction processes for a low-cost optical PM2.5 measurement system comprising a nephelometer and an optical particle counter: (1) optical calibration grounded in Mie theory to account for variations in sensor performance driven by aerosol size distribution, refractive index, and hygroscopic growth, and (2) determination of ALW to estimate dry-equivalent PM2.5 mass concentrations under high RH conditions. The corrected PM2.5 data exhibit strong agreement with EPA reference measurements, affirming the robustness of the proposed correction framework. Furthermore, the quantification of ALW offers valuable insights for advancing aqueous-phase aerosol chemistry and secondary aerosol formation studies. For regions without colocated CSN data, we provide practical guidance for applying these correction methods using surrogate information. Overall, the methodologies developed in this work are expected to significantly enhance the accuracy and applicability of low-cost optical PM2.5 sensors in humid environments."

 Topography in mountain areas redistributes the incoming solar radiation and determines water availability, creating microclimates and forming distinct habitat conditions within short distances. How this local topography modulates the impacts of climate change on the growth of vegetation on mountains at large scales remains unclear. Here we quantify the difference in vegetation density between polar-facing and equatorial-facing slopes (defined as aspect asymmetry) across the Northern Hemisphere and find a weakening trend of aspect asymmetry from 2003 to 2024. For regions that show higher vegetation density on the polar-facing slopes, the magnitude, area and seasonal duration of aspect asymmetry all decreased, implying a reduction in water control on vegetation growth. Further analyses show that the observed changes in vegetation aspect asymmetry are attributable to hydrothermal conditions, and are dominated by solar radiation and temperature in particular. Our findings highlight changes in an underexplored but important part of mountain ecosystems, with implications for ecological stability under climate change.

 In the Arctic Ocean, a substantial portion of primary production occurs under sea ice and around the subsurface chlorophyll maximum. In these low-light environments, primary production will depend on photoacclimation, which increases phytoplankton’s chlorophyll content per unit of carbon biomass to enhance photon capture. Here, we incorporated a photoacclimation theory based on resource allocation optimization into a global ecosystem model, showing that remarkably high chlorophyll content responding to low-light environments is a primary driver of under-ice production. The distribution of primary production is more strongly correlated with phytoplankton carbon biomass than with chlorophyll concentration. We estimated that approximately half of the Arctic Ocean’s primary production occurs in regions where satellite observations are challenging (i.e., where ice concentration exceeds 10%). This mechanistic framework enhances our ability to interpret observed distributions of chlorophyll and primary production and predict ongoing changes in the Arctic Ocean primary production under shifting environmental conditions. Arctic chlorophyll content under ice and around the subsurface chlorophyll maximum is several times higher than surface open-water regions, resulting in a phytoplankton growth rate beneath the ice comparable to open-water areas, according to global ecosystem model simulations."

 Abrupt changes at decadal time scale are recurrent events in the modern climate system. Using multiple trend-change detection methods, here we report such an abrupt trend change in the early 2010s in the altimetry-based global mean sea level record, as well as in its thermal and mass components. Abrupt trend change in the mass component is mostly due to terrestrial water storage and to a lesser extent to ice sheet melting. The linear rate of rise of the global mean sea level increases abruptly from 2.9 ± 0.22 mm yr−1 over 1993–2011 to 4.1 ± 0.25 mm yr−1 over 2012–2024. Abrupt trend changes in numerous climate parameters have also been reported in the early 2010s, suggesting a more global phenomenon. Internal climate variability is likely the main driver of the early 2010s sharp change observed in sea level and components, although one cannot totally exclude any additional contribution from increased radiative forcing.

 Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), consisting of volatile organic compounds (VOC), can induce and prime defence-related responses in neighbouring plants. However, atmospheric pollutants such as tropospheric ozone (O3) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) can disrupt these interactions by accelerating VOC oxidation and inducing oxidative stress. Here, we investigated the effects of O3 and diesel exhaust pollution on interactions between Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) seedlings by examining the responses of undamaged receiver plants to cues from weevil-damaged neighbours. Using a novel Free-Air Diesel and Ozone Enrichment (FADOE) platform, we exposed seedlings to elevated O3, diesel exhaust (NOX), both in combination, and ambient air. Receiver seedlings exhibited a 49% reduction in bark damage, a 15% increase in net photosynthesis, and priming of green leaf volatile emissions compared to controls and altered blend of emitted VOCs. Despite air pollution affecting photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and VOC emissions, neighbour-induced defences against herbivory remained effective under polluted conditions.

 Episodic reductions in underwater light can be a key driver of marine ecosystem degradation. Yet a consistent event-based framework describing the frequency, duration and intensity of substantial but short-term reductions in underwater light does not exist. Here, we proposed marine darkwaves as a framework for quantifying these episodic reductions of underwater light at specific depths which aligns with definitions of other episodic and extreme events. The framework was applied to long-term in situ time series of underwater irradiance from California, USA (16 years, 6.3 metres) and New Zealand (10 years, at 7 and 20 metres). We showed evidence of several intense marine darkwaves across these sites, with durations up to 64 days, cumulative light deficits reaching −105.6 mol photon·m−2, and up to almost 100% light loss versus climatology. We extended the framework to satellite-derived seabed irradiance data across New Zealand’s East Cape region (2002–2023), using a set of 10th percentile threshold and a minimum duration of 5 days. This revealed 25 to 80 spatially varying seabed events, and event durations of 5 to 15 days. Importantly, the framework enables local to continental-scale comparisons of the patterns and ecological consequences of episodic light reduction in marine ecosystems.

 Rooftop greening is increasingly recognized as a pathway to urban sustainability and environmental equity, yet its fine-scale temporal dynamics and distributional fairness remain insufficiently examined. This study develops a building-level framework that constructs annual rooftop greenness time series from satellite-derived NDVI and introduces a Rooftop Greenness Inequality Index (RGII) based on the rooftop green fraction to evaluate distributive fairness. By integrating these measures with a multi-pattern trend classification, the framework captures the co-evolution of temporal dynamics and spatial inequality, and links them to socioeconomic conditions to identify key drivers and vulnerable communities. Using Hong Kong as a case study (2018–2024), we find overall greenness gains and inequality reductions, though unevenly distributed. Citywide, 22.1% of buildings showed significant increases, while 2.1% showed consistent decreases. All 452 communities saw inequality decrease, with the median RGII falling from 0.65 to 0.45. Greenness trajectories varied by land use and development stage: public housing showed a 38.9% rise compared with 21.1% in private housing, and late-stage new towns grew faster but with less stability than older districts. Socioeconomic disparities shaped outcomes: communities with high rent burden, large non-local populations, or many single-person households showed limited improvement, whereas those with more spatial capacity or stronger cultural cohesion performed better. Vulnerable areas were concentrated in older high-density districts where greenness remained low and inequality persisted. These findings demonstrate the framework’s capacity to integrate rooftop greenness change with social dimensions, providing transferable tools for equity-oriented greening strategies in high-density cities."

 Accurate, privacy-respecting soil information is essential for site-specific nutrient management and carbon accounting, yet the cost of laboratory analyses limits many farms to relatively sparse sampling grids. We propose a collaborative framework that couples a national Sentinel-2 bare-soil composite with FL to produce high-resolution clay and soil organic carbon (SOC) maps while keeping all local data on-premise. A one-dimensional convolutional neural network was first pre-trained on a 53,570-sample Brazilian archive and then fine-tuned across 50 farms through synchronous Federated Averaging. We benchmarked this hybrid configuration against (i) a purely centralized model trained on the same archive and (ii) a fully decentralized FL model initialized at random.Across farm-level validation sets, pre-trained FL lowered median RMSE by 42% for clay and 31% for SOC relative to the centralized baseline, while increasing median RPIQ by 33% and 25%, respectively. On farms with ≤150 samples, the gains remained substantial, confirming that the approach remains effective when local datasets are modest compared with national archives. Error distributions differed significantly between scenarios (Friedman and Wilcoxon tests), and the pre-trained FL maps removed most spatial artefacts observed in the centralized outputs while preserving fine-scale gradients. Because only encrypted weight updates are exchanged, sensitive information never leaves the farm, satisfying GDPR/LGPD-style constraints and allowing late-joining clients to inherit an increasingly mature global model. Taken together, these results indicate that continental pre-training followed by federated fine-tuning reconciles global generality with local specificity and offers a scalable blueprint for privacy-preserving, high-resolution soil mapping in settings where sample densities are often substantially lower than in experimental setups, without compromising data sovereignty."

 Satellite-derived formaldehyde (HCHO) column densities are commonly used to infer regional emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs). However, intercomparison and validation of HCHO retrievals from different satellite sensors remain scarce, especially under fire periods. Here, we use observations from FIREX-AQ (Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality experiment) and WE-CAN (Western Wildfire Experiment for Cloud Chemistry, Aerosol and Nitrogen), two flight campaigns dedicated to investigating smoke plumes during active fire seasons, combined with simulations from the GEOS-Chem to intercompare and validate five HCHO products from four satellites (OMI, OMPS-NPP, OMPS-N20, and TROPOMI). Our analysis suggests that all satellite products consistently capture elevated HCHO signals over the southeastern US and California, but they tend to report lower column values compared to our aircraft-constrained model estimates, with differences ranging from 11.0 % to 56.7 %. Our results imply that while vertical profile shape (reflected in the air mass factor, AMF) plays a role, errors in the slant column retrieval and the treatment of aerosol and cloud scattering effects may be key sources of uncertainty in the satellite HCHO products during fire events. Therefore, future retrieval improvements should prioritize better aerosol and slant column accuracy to reduce biases."

 The timing of the spring season in the boreal region is shifting under global warming, with profound impacts on ecosystems and hydrological processes. However, the mechanisms driving this transition and its considerable interannual variability are not well described, especially regarding the influence of large-scale atmospheric teleconnection patterns. This study examines the temporal variability of the observed thermal spring season across Finland, a boreal country warming faster than the global average. Key spring timing indices, including onset, end, duration, and growing season onset, were calculated and analyzed using high-resolution (1 km × 1 km) daily mean temperature data from 1961 to 2023. Spatial and temporal patterns were identified through Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) decomposition, and their associations with major atmospheric teleconnection patterns were examined. Results indicated that during the past six decades, the spring onset has advanced by 2–6 days/decade, with the most pronounced changes in the coastal and southwestern parts of the country. The duration of the spring season has extended by 3–6 days/decade in the northern areas and along the southwestern coast. The early spring onset was associated with a strong positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation (AO), and delayed spring end and growing season onset were linked to the positive phase of the East Atlantic–West Russia (EAWR) pattern. By contrast, an early growing season start was linked to the positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The duration of the thermal spring season showed a strong association with the Scandinavian (SCA) pattern."

China, as both the world’s largest emitter and a region of rapid ecological change, plays a key role in the global carbon cycle. Yet uncertainties in atmospheric forcing datasets remain a significant source of uncertainty in land surface model simulations and are rarely assessed systematically. Here, we assess China’s terrestrial carbon budget (1979–2014) using the Community Land Model (CLM5.0) driven by three widely used meteorological datasets: CRUNCEP, the Global Soil Wetness Project Phase 3 (GSWP3), and the China Meteorological Forcing Dataset (CMFD), and evaluated against more than 800 FLUXNET site-months and nine eddy covariance towers. Forcing choice strongly alters the magnitude and trend of carbon fluxes, and China’s terrestrial ecosystems acted as either a weak carbon sink or a net source, depending on the forcing. GSWP3 performed best overall in simulating gross primary productivity (GPP), CRUNCEP relatively poorly, and CMFD best in high-altitude and cold-dry regions. Total ecosystem carbon storage was estimated at 86.30–90.00 PgC, primarily in soil (84.1%) and vegetation (15.9%). Interannual GPP variability was mainly controlled by precipitation (29.4%), followed by temperature (17.2%), while shortwave radiation had negative effects (11.5%). Shapley additive explanations analysis further showed that moisture-related variables (precipitation and humidity) dominate interannual GPP variability. By combining process-based modeling and machine learning, this study shows how uncertainties in meteorological inputs affect terrestrial carbon dynamics. These findings underscore the limitations of single-forcing simulations in Earth system modeling and highlight the need for improved meteorological inputs to support robust carbon budgeting and climate neutrality goals."

Chloroform (CHCl3) is a prominent VSLS with poorly constrained anthropogenic sources that include its unintentional production when wood pulp is bleached for paper production. Recent assessments of the global CHCl3 budget have relied on emission factors (EFs) for the pulp/paper (PP) sector derived some 35 years ago when industrial practices were markedly different. Here, we analysed data from the Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers of the USA, Canada and Japan. Combined with data on the national number of pulp mills and bleached wood pulp production volume, we derive plausible lower and upper limit EFs. These factors show a downward trend since the early 2000s, which we attribute to a continued phase-down in the use of ‘elemental chlorine’ bleaching in favour of ‘elemental chlorine free’ bleaching. The derived mean EFs for the period 2000–2020, expressed as the mass of CHCl3 per air–dried tons (adt) of bleached pulp, are in close agreement for the regions considered: USA (39.8 ± 32 g/adt), Canada (38.6 ± 29.8 g/adt) and Japan (30.1 ± 8.6 g/adt). Assuming these factors are broadly representative of other world regions, a mean annual global CHCl3 source of 3 (1–6) Gg yr−1 from the PP sector is estimated for the approximate 2000–2020 period. We conclude that the sector’s contribution to the global CHCl3 budget has likely decreased considerably since the 1990s and that the use of older EFs to calculate present-day emissions should be avoided."

Yet mine-level inventories remain uncertain because publicly available measurements are sparse, outdated, and inconsistent. We assemble a 2011–2023 mine-level database of methane emission factors (EFs) by integrating the national coal-mine gas assessment with provincial disclosures and other sources. We harmonize definitions and impute missing data (10%–30% for key predictors; 23% for relative gas emissions) using a random-forest multiple-imputation framework incorporating geological and operational predictors and propagating uncertainty. The database reveals pronounced spatiotemporal heterogeneity, with a 92% reduction in small mines despite broadly stable national capacity. National production-weighted EFs declined from 5.39 kg t−1 in 2011 to 4.24 kg t−1 in 2020 as de-capacity policies retired high-emission mines and operational upgrades reduced intensities, and then rebounded to 4.78 kg t−1 in 2023, mainly due to higher production in provinces with above-average EFs, with a possible contribution from deeper mining. A persistent north–south gradient remains, and provinces dominated by coking coal exhibit systematically higher emissions. Selective non-disclosure by high-gas mines may introduce non-random missingness and bias the upper tail downward. Uncertainty analysis shows larger absolute but smaller relative errors for high-gas mines, with total uncertainty dominated by model generalization. The integrated dataset enables targeted mitigation at mine and provincial levels and provides a transparent basis for prioritizing high-emission and high-uncertainty regions. It highlights the need for standardized reporting, targeted measurements, and continuous updates to strengthen China’s coal-methane governance and NDC-aligned policy design."

This enhancement allows the model to ingest two dimensional fields of grid aggregated roof albedo and fractional rooftop area availability for HMS implementation. By incorporating these spatially varying inputs, the model overcomes previous limitations that relied on idealized scenarios. Using Austin, Texas, as a testbed metropolitan area, we assessed the realistic potential for cooling the city by reducing the 2 m air temperature (T2M) and universal thermal climate index (UTCI) through various HMS. Specifically, we evaluated cool roofs, green roofs, and solar photovoltaics under two scenarios: (i) complete roof area coverage and (ii) realistic implementation based on the available flat (non-pitched) roof area. Additionally, we implemented urban gardens and street trees and assessed their effectiveness in reducing T2M and UTCI. All experiments, including a control scenario without any HMS, were conducted during clear-sky days in August 2020, which was one of the hottest months recorded in Austin. The results indicate that while cool and green roofs are effective, their effectiveness is obfuscated in the city-wide mean T2M and UTCI reduction. Further, the realistic implementation of HMS had a negligible impact on city-wide mean T2M and UTCI. Nevertheless, these realistic rooftop simulations demonstrated potential for localized cooling in some areas of the city. Combining realistic rooftop-based HMS with urban gardens and street trees similarly resulted in limited city-wide cooling while yielding noticeable cooling in some grid cells. Street trees showed a large potential for locally reducing UTCI. These findings have direct implications for urban planning and heat mitigation approaches, as they highlight the need for evaluating HMS based on local (e.g. urban-block-scale) impacts using realistic implementation constraints, rather than emphasizing city-wide reductions in T2M or UTCI."

Increasing grid resolution, reducing dinitrogen pentoxide hydrolysis uptake, and refining emissions improve model performance, although seasonal and diurnal discrepancies persist, requiring further refinement. 
 In recent years, nitrate aerosols have become a dominant component of atmospheric composition, surpassing sulfate in both concentration and climatic impact. However, accurately simulating nitrate remains a major challenge for global models due to complex formation mechanisms and strong regional variability. This study investigates key factors influencing nitrate aerosol formation to improve simulation accuracy in polluted regions. Using the EMAC climate–chemistry model and the ISORROPIA II thermodynamic module, we assess the effects of grid resolution, emission inventories, chemical kinetics, thermodynamic assumptions, and aerosol scavenging processes. Model predictions are evaluated against PM2.5 and PM1 nitrate observations from filter networks and aerosol mass spectrometer campaigns across Europe, North America, East Asia, and India. Results show that PM2.5 nitrate is generally overestimated, especially in East Asia (up to a factor of three), while PM1 nitrate is underestimated, particularly at urban-downwind sites. Higher grid resolution, adjusted N2O5 uptake, and updated emissions (e.g., CMIP6) improve PM2.5 predictions but do not consistently enhance PM1 accuracy. Seasonal and diurnal biases are most pronounced in Europe, where the model fails to capture observed nitrate variability. Sensitivity tests show limited impact on the total tropospheric nitrate burden (within 25 %). A combined configuration using high grid resolution, reduced N2O5 uptake, and the HTAPv3 emission inventory improves PM2.5 predictions in low-concentration periods and U.S. networks, but PM1 biases persist regionally. These findings highlight the difficulty of achieving consistent improvements across aerosol size modes and diverse geographic regions."

The study shows ATLID’s power to reveal how eruptions can affect climate, clouds, and ozone for more than a year. 
 The Atmospheric LIDar (ATLID) instrument of the ESA's Earth Cloud, Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) satellite mission launched in May 2024 provides high-resolution vertical profiling of aerosols and clouds at 355 nm. Fully operational since July 2024, ATLID has been witness to a significant perturbation of stratospheric aerosol budget following the eruptions of Ruang volcano (Indonesia) in late April 2024. Using ATLID together with limb-viewing satellite instruments (OMPS-LP and SAGE III), we quantify the stratospheric aerosol perturbation generated by the Ruang eruption and characterize the global transport of volcanic aerosols. To evaluate the ATLID performance in the stratosphere, its data are compared with collocated ground-based lidar observations at various locations in both hemispheres and overpass-coordinated balloon flights carrying AZOR backscatter sonde. The intercomparison with suborbital observations suggests excellent performance of ATLID in the stratosphere and proves its capacity to accurately resolve fine structures in the vertical distribution of stratospheric aerosols. Using various satellite observations, we show that Ruang's eruptive sequence in April 2024 produced eruptive columns reaching 25 km altitude, and resulted in a doubling of the tropical stratospheric aerosol abundance for several months. The eruption timing in austral Fall and its high-altitude reach fostered efficient poleward transport into the southern extratropics during austral Winter 2024. By the time of the austral Fall 2025, the sulphate aerosols from Ruang have spread across the entire Southern hemisphere and were most probably entrained by the 2025 Antarctic polar vortex, potentially enhancing the polar stratospheric cloud occurrence."

 Aerosol acidity plays a crucial role in multiphase atmospheric chemistry, influencing aerosol composition, gas-particle partitioning, and the oxidative capacity of atmosphere. However, the mechanisms governing aerosol acidity in coastal areas under extreme weather remains challenging due to the complexity of atmospheric transport. Here, we investigate aerosol pH in Shenzhen, a coastal megacity in China, by integrating field observations with multiphase buffer theory and ISORROPIA simulations. Our observations captured both a typhoon episode and typical non-typhoon periods with two contrasting regimes: during non-typhoon periods, aerosols were consistently buffered by the NH4+/NH3 pair, with relative humidity serving as the primary driver of pH variability, enabling reliable predictions using multiphase buffer theory. In contrast, during a typhoon episode, nonvolatile cations derived from sea salts emerged as the dominant drivers, violating the charge balance for NH4+/NH3 buffering and leading to poor performance of buffer theory. ISORROPIA simulations under the assumption of constant aerosol water content reproduced the observed pH more reliably, highlighting a compositional rather than meteorological control. Our results provide direct field-based evidence for regime shifts in aerosol acidity regulation in coastal regions and underscore the need for chemical transport models to account for composition-meteorology interactions to improve acidity predictions under extreme weather events."

This study has three objectives, (1) to evaluate HPR retrievals, (2) to exploit the combination of dual-frequency (DF) space-borne radar (SR) and dual-polarisation (DP) ground-based radar (GR) observations for estimating HPRs based on SR DF observations and (3) to further improve HPR estimates based on DP GR observations. 
 Conventional radar-based hydrometeor classification algorithms identify the dominant hydrometeor type within a resolved radar volume, while newer techniques estimate the proportions of individual hydrometeor classes (hydrometeor partitioning ratios, HPRs) within a mixture. These newer algorithms (HMCP) are based on dual-polarization measurements from ground-based radars (GR), while to date no comparable algorithms for space-borne radars (SR) with dual-frequency capabilities exist. This study (1) further improves HPR estimates based on GR dual-polarization measurements, (2) exploits the combination of dual-frequency SR and dual-polarization GR to introduce HPRs based on dual-frequency observations only, and (3) evaluates GR- and SR-based HPR retrievals. To achieve these objectives, dual-polarization measurements of NEXRAD's GRs are matched with those of the dual-frequency precipitation radar of the Global Precipitation Measurement Core satellite. All matched volumes are represented by averaged dual-frequency and dual-polarization observations and several hundred GR sub-volumes classified with standard hydrometeor classification. The latter are used to calculate quasi-HPRs (qHPRs). qHPRs and averaged dual-frequency and dual-polarization variables of the training dataset are used to derive covariances and centroids for each hydrometeor class. They serve as the basis for dual-frequency and dual-polarization based HPR retrievals within HMCP and are applied to the test dataset. The ensuing evaluation of HPR retrievals is performed with the qHPRs of the test dataset. HPRs show for most hydrometeor classes high correlations with the qHPRs and confirm the overall good HMCP performance. However, dual-polarization based classification performance is superior to dual-frequency ones. Both underestimate snow, overestimate graupel, and result in low correlations for big drops."

This study shows that surface-based spectral irradiance combined with deep neural network models can accurately estimate PWV under various atmospheric conditions. Models using global, direct, and diffuse irradiances performed best, while even global-only data gave reliable results. 
 Precipitable water vapor (PWV) is a key component of Earth's climate and hydrological systems, yet its accurate and continuous observation under varying sky conditions remains challenging. This study demonstrates the strong potential of surface-based spectral irradiance measurements for PWV retrieval across a range of atmospheric conditions using deep neural network (DNN) models trained on water vapor absorption bands. Global, direct, and diffuse spectral irradiances observed at water vapor absorption bands of 929.0–997.3, 800.9–840.5, and 708.1–744.6 nm by a spectroradiometer (MS-700; EKO Instruments Co., Ltd., Japan) equipped with a rotating shadow-band system were used as test data, while PWV observed by a microwave radiometer (MP-1500; Radiometrics Corporation, USA) served as reference data for model training and validation. Models incorporating global, direct, and diffuse irradiances achieved the highest accuracy, exhibiting minimal errors and closely capturing seasonal PWV variations. Notably, even models using only global irradiance – an easier and more accessible measurement – maintained high predictive performance, with low errors and robust seasonal tracking. In contrast, models trained solely on clear-sky direct irradiance with substantially fewer samples than those under all-sky conditions showed relatively higher errors and weaker generalization, underscoring the importance of data volume and diversity in DNN models. These results highlight the effectiveness of spectral irradiance-based approaches for continuous PWV estimation across a range of atmospheric conditions. Future research should incorporate additional spectral bands sensitive to constituents like aerosols and ozone to expand retrieval capability."

 Climate change and extreme weather events pose challenges to food security, emphasizing the need for reliable and timely monitoring of crop and rangeland conditions. For this purpose, long-term consistent Earth Observation datasets on vegetation conditions are typically used in early warning and crop yield forecast systems. However, the near-real-time (NRT) production of high quality datasets and the need to guarantee long-term records present various challenges. To address these, we present a NRT global dataset of Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) at 500 m resolution, optimized for agricultural applications. Our dataset combines MODIS-FPAR (Collection 6.1) and VIIRS-FPAR (Collection 2) data, ensuring continuity from 2000 to well beyond 2030.  We applied a robust filtering approach based on the Whittaker smoother to produce reliable FPAR estimates in NRT, accounting for sparse and irregular spaced observations due to cloud cover. The dataset is composed of two 10 d filtered timeseries: (1) MODIS-FPAR for 2000 to 2023, being the reference dataset, and (2) intercalibrated VIIRS-FPAR for 2018 onward. While several methods can effectively smooth and gap-fill FPAR data (i.e., using observations before and after the estimation date), our method is designed for optimal filtering in NRT (i.e., using only prior observations). Our approach yields six successive  estimates of the same FPAR data point with increasing quality: an inital estimate immediately after the 10 d reference period, four subsequent estimates every 10 d using new observations, and a final consolidated estimate 90 d later. The implemented filtering ingests the available FPAR observations and their original quality assessment (QA) layers. To avoid unrealistic extrapolation when observations are sparse, we impose constraints, season and location specific, to FPAR estimates.  We then intercalibrated the VIIRS-FPAR with the MODIS-FPAR filtered timeseries, using a mean difference correction approach, to ensure consistency between both series. This paper describes the filtering and intercalibration method used, the quality assessment of resulting timeseries, and details the obtained products and the corresponding QA layers.

The dataset reveals a 45.87 % expansion of Chinese oases, mainly driven by cropland expansion and grassland restoration. The consistent, high-resolution OasisMap30 dataset provides a valuable basis for investigating oasis landscape dynamics, socio-ecological responses, and sustainable development in dryland regions. 
 High spatio-temporal resolution maps of oasis land cover are valuable for understanding ecological and societal development processes in dryland regions. However, the relatively late development of oasis research, combined with the highly fragmented structure of oases and their frequent land cover transitions, has made it challenging to construct high spatio-temporal resolution land cover datasets for oases. As a result, dedicated data products of this kind are still lacking. Here, we developed a framework for annual 30 m land cover mapping that integrates Landsat satellite imagery, machine learning, a temporal segmentation approach (LandTrendr), and principal component analysis. Using this framework, we produced a 30 m resolution annual land-cover dataset for Chinese oases (OasisMap30) for the period 1987–2024 on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Accuracy assessment based on more than 6,300 visually interpreted samples demonstrates high accuracy of OasisMap30 (overall accuracy >90 %). In cross-product comparisons based on visually interpreted and third-party test samples, OasisMap30 exhibits considerable advantages in terms of classification accuracy and error reduction. Moreover, in comparison with several 30 m resolution thematic products for impervious surface, cropland, and surface water, we found an impressive consistency between OasisMap30 and these datasets. Using OasisMap30, we investigated the changes in land cover patterns of Chinese oases. The results show that oasis area expanded by 45.87 % (+7.75 Mha) between 1987 and 2024, primarily driven by cropland expansion and grassland restoration. Specifically, 4.04 Mha of desert were restored to grassland, and 3.19 Mha were converted from desert to cropland. In addition, OasisMap30 reveals the expansion of impervious surfaces (0.58 Mha) and surface water (0.35 Mha), as well as conversions among land cover types, such as the conversion of 3.12 Mha of grassland to cropland. Overall, the consistent, high-resolution OasisMap30 data can substantially support studies on the evolution of oasis landscape patterns, socio-ecological responses, and spatial pattern optimization, thereby contributing to the sustainable development of oasis regions.

It demonstrates robust performance across a wide range of conditions, capturing spatial structures in an intuitive and physically meaningful way. This new metric offers researchers an improved tool for evaluating and inter-comparing climate models. 
 Developing and evaluating spatial efficiency metrics is essential for assessing how well climate or other models of the Earth's system reproduce the observed patterns of variables like precipitation, temperature, atmospheric pollutants, and other environmental data presented in a gridded format. In this study, we propose a new metric, the Modified Spatial Efficiency (MSPAEF), designed to overcome limitations identified in existing metrics, such as the Spatial Efficiency (SPAEF), the Wasserstein Spatial Efficiency (WSPAEF), or the Spatial Pattern Efficiency metric (Esp). The performance of MSPAEF is systematically compared to these metrics across a range of synthetic data scenarios characterized by varying spatial correlation coefficients, biases, and standard deviation ratios. Results demonstrate that MSPAEF consistently provides robust and intuitive performance, accurately capturing spatial patterns under diverse conditions. Additionally, two realistic but synthetic case studies are presented to further evaluate the practical applicability of the metrics. In both examples, MSPAEF delivers results that align with intuitive expectations, while the other metrics exhibit limitations in identifying specific features in at least one case. Finally, as a real-world application, we rank global Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) model data according to their skill in representing precipitation and temperature using the four different metrics. This application highlights that the MSPAEF rankings are most similar with Esp with a normalized absolute ranking difference of 2.8 for precipitation, and 3.8 for temperature. These findings highlight the added value of the MSPAEF metric in evaluating spatial distributions and its potential to be used in climate or other environmental model evaluation or inter-comparison exercises."

Here, we developed a 14C-nanotracing platform integrated with accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) to achieve subpicogram sensitivity for organ-level quantification of inhaled PM. 14C-labeled black carbon PM was generated via pyrolysis of 14C-n-hexane and introduced into a controlled inhalation chamber. ICR mice (n = 7) were exposed to short-intense (1 h, high concentration) and long-mild (3 h day–1 for 7 days, low concentration) protocols to represent acute and subchronic exposure conditions. Quantitative AMS analysis revealed systemic translocation of carbonaceous PM, with organ burdens following the order lung > liver > kidney > brain. After short-term exposure, 360 pg accumulated in the liver, 120 pg in the kidney, and 4.8 pg in brain tissue, whereas prolonged exposure increased these burdens by 3–6-fold, reaching 15 pg in the brain. These findings indicate substantial retention of PM across multiple organs including neural tissues of the brain. This 14C-nanotracing approach enables a quantitative framework for linking inhaled PM exposure to systemic burden, supporting toxicokinetic modeling and evidence-based air quality regulation."

In this study, we applied a bespoke geochemical framework to samples collected from 401 Canadian nonproducing wells and determined methane origins for 112 samples originating from either surface casing vent (SCV) or wellhead emissions at 100 of these wells. We found that the presence of thermogenic methane at the SCV is a good indicator of high-emission wells, with average emission magnitudes  500 times higher than those of microbial sources. Our results also show that half of the studied wells emit a mix of thermogenic and microbial methane. Compared to previous estimates, our percentage of wells emitting microbial methane (∼23%) is three times higher, and the associated median emission rate is 1000 times greater.

The regression models were applied to rapidly estimate MIM modeling parameters related to the transport and fate of As based on readily available soil properties for the vadose zone. As transport was simulated by considering infiltrations controlled by both retardation and remobilization induced by wet–dry cycles. When applied to 21 sites across South Korea, the framework yielded AF values of >1 at all locations with substantial variability (3.56–24.38), which highlights the buffering capacity of the vadose zone and the necessity of site-specific assessment. This scalable framework offers a practical alternative to conventional reactive transport models that facilitates reliable risk assessments of As groundwater contamination by the infiltrates through the vadose zone."

The framework further integrates coastal geomorphological and tidal characteristics to account for the regulating effects of natural processes on plastic emissions. To systematically characterize pollution severity, we proposed the Coastal Plastic Pollution Index (CPPI), which classifies coastal input sites into four levels (I–IV) based on estimated emission. The model estimated global coastal plastic emission in 2019 between 15.32 and 59.18 Kt, with per capita values ranging from 2.17 to 8.38 g. Mismanaged plastic waste (MPW), plastic waste generation (PWG), consumer and institutional products (CIP), packaging (PAC) PET, and PP play dominant roles in coastal emissions. After clustering the sampling data using unsupervised learning, we found a high degree of consistency in CPPI distribution among countries within the same cluster.

The quantification of the impacts of extreme events on crop yield has predominantly concentrated on individual events like drought or heat. Numerous instances have showcased the destructive effects of compound extreme events on crop yields, surpassing those of individual events. However, their influence extent is region‐specific and not fully understood in Australia's crop belt. Using a biophysical‐statistical modeling approach, we quantified the individual impacts of drought, heat, frost, and compound drought and extreme temperature (DET) events on wheat yield variations in Australia. We first developed indices for these different extreme events during the wheat reproductive period based on the APSIM (Agricultural Production System sIMulator) model and then used these indices in multiple linear regression models to quantify their impacts on wheat yield variations. We found that, during 1990–2021, drought, heat, and frost events explained 48% of yield variation, while the percentage increased to 54% after including DET events, with some regions even up to 86%. In extreme low‐yield years, the relative importance of DET events surpassed the sum importance of individual drought, heat, and frost events, reaching 52% in years with yields below the 10th percentiles, respectively.

However, substantial variability among current wind resource and power simulations used for wind farm deployment limits the reliability of siting and system integration decisions. Therefore, we present a transparent, open source, validated and evaluated, global wind power simulation workflow for the renewable energy simulation tool ETHOS.RESKit. As the first wind simulation workflow using the new Global Wind Atlas 4 and the fifth iteration of the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis, it is capable of simulating time-resolved energy output of wind turbines with high spatial resolution and customizable designs for both onshore and offshore wind turbines. The tool has undergone an extensive validation and calibration process using over 18 million global measurements from meteorological masts for wind speed bias correction and 8 million measurements from wind turbine sites across 6 countries during 2002 to 2021. In comparison with measured energy yield from wind turbine sites, we achieve a global average capacity factor mean error of 5.6% and Pearson correlation of 0.844. In addition, we evaluate its performance against annually aggregated energy production data from operational wind farms and country-level wind power generation statistics reported by energy agencies, demonstrating its accuracy across multiple spatial and temporal scales with a mean error of only 0.6%. Additionally, a final calibration step ensures alignment of the simulation with real world statistics.

 The Northwest Pacific Subtropical High (NWPSH) presents a notable and even counterintuitive phenomenon: it shows a strong positive correlation between June and August (correlation coefficient: 0.55, significant at the 99.5% confidence level) during 1979–2005, while this correlation weakens sharply to -0.05 in 2006–2024. However, the relationships between June and July, and between July and August remain consistently weak throughout the entire period. Positive sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the tropical North Indian Ocean (TNIO) contribute to a persistent intensification of the NWPSH from June to August before 2005. Meanwhile, the Boreal Summer Intraseasonal Oscillation (BSISO) exhibits a stronger 60-day periodicity, which can cause opposite (similar) variations of NWPSH in adjacent month (cross-month). Under the combined effects of TNIO SST positive anomalies and BSISO, the NWPSH mainly exhibits the cross-month correlation feature, while the relationships between adjacent months are very weak. After 2005, the BSISO exhibits a marked shortening of its periodicity, and the key SST regions associated with the NWPSH in June, July, and August are also inconsistent, which induce the weakening of the cross-month correlation feature of the NWPSH. The shortening of the BSISO’s periodicity is attributed to warming over the Maritime Continent and the tropical western Indian Ocean, which intensify both the zonal Walker and meridional Hadley circulations. These changes enhance downward motions over the tropical eastern Indian Ocean and the northwestern Pacific, thereby suppressing the initiation of BSISO’ convection and accelerating its decay."

 Western North America (WNA) is a regional hotspot for summer heat extremes. However, our understanding of the atmospheric processes driving WNA heatwaves remains largely based on a few case studies. In this study, we investigate the general characteristics of atmospheric pathways associated with WNA heatwaves using a 30-member high-resolution coupled model simulation. Synthesizing the WNA heatwave events across the large ensemble, we reinforce the view that WNA heatwaves are systematically driven by: (1) a Rossby wave train originating from the western North Pacific, (2) poleward moisture transport toward the Gulf of Alaska, occasionally via atmospheric rivers, and (3) downstream ridge amplification over WNA. Although these features also appear in the late twenty-first-century projections, notable changes include farther poleward moisture transport and broader ridge development in the future. Under the anomaly-based heatwave definition used in this study, which removes the influence of mean temperature change, the frequency of WNA heatwaves is projected to decrease. Our findings suggest that mechanisms identified in case studies, including upstream Rossby wave packets and subsequent moist processes, are broadly applicable to understanding WNA heatwaves over recent decades and their projected changes."

Climate model simulations, accounting for the multi-episode nature of the eruption, were validated by observational reconstructions of the climate response. 
 Northern Eurasia tropospheric winter warming has been observed and modeled after major tropical volcanic eruptions. Here we show that a high-latitude eruption with a persistent stratospheric volcanic cloud from summer to early winter can also trigger winter warming. Our model simulations, incorporating updated volcanic forcing for the 1783 Laki eruption, closely align with two recent temperature reconstructions—whereas simulations of other eruptions lacking substantial cold-season aerosol loadings fail to produce such warming. The aerosol-induced mid-latitude stratospheric warming strengthens the meridional temperature gradient, enhances the polar vortex, and shifts both horizontal and vertical energy redistribution in favor of Northern Eurasia winter warming. Neutral or cold winters, nevertheless, remain possible in individual realizations due to internal variability. These findings help resolve model-observation discrepancies and highlight the crucial role of stratosphere-troposphere coupling in shaping large-scale circulation patterns in the aftermath of volcanic eruptions.

Leveraging this relationship, we introduce a constraining framework to enhance the accuracy of regional climate projections. The mechanism is that the changes in DTR are primarily driven by external forces such as greenhouse gas emissions, rather than internal climate variability. Increasing greenhouse gases reduces cloud cover, which migrates DTR decline by enhancing daytime shortwave radiation and reducing nighttime longwave radiation.

Our findings contribute to reducing uncertainties in model projections, offering valuable insights into future changes in DTR and their implications for regional climate responses. 
 In the late twentieth century, nighttime land surface temperatures are observed to rise faster than daytime temperatures, resulting in high diurnal temperature ranges and considerable diurnal asymmetric warming. Nevertheless, the projected changes in diurnal temperature ranges under global warming remain with large uncertainties across statistical multi-model simulations. Here, we identify an emergent relationship between historical diurnal temperature ranges variability and future projections on both global and regional scales. By leveraging this spatially heterogeneous relationship, we present a framework to refine regional projections, reducing model uncertainties by 15–68% across the 27 IPCC AR6 reference regions. Our findings suggest a sustained influence of external forcing on diurnal temperature ranges from past to future, driven primarily by related widespread reductions in cloud cover, rather than internal variability.

 Recent decades have witnessed increasing snow droughts in the Northern Hemisphere, yet reliable future projections remain challenging due to biases in climate models. This study employs a Cumulative Distribution Function-transform bias correction method to refine Snow Water Equivalent outputs from 29 CMIP6 models, enabling a robust assessment of future snow drought characteristics using the Snow Water Equivalent Index. Our analysis reveals a fundamental structural shift in snow drought regimes under high-emission scenarios. While the frequency and duration of less severe droughts may stabilize or even decline, the most extreme droughts intensify dramatically—becoming more frequent, prolonged, and severe. This escalation is strongly tied to emission levels, with the SSP585 scenario projecting a 54.5% increase in duration and a six-fold rise in intensification trends compared to sustainable pathways. Spatially, hotspots emerge across Europe, western Asia, and central North America. These findings underscore the critical need for rapid emission reductions to mitigate escalating snow drought risks and their profound implications for water resources, ecosystems, and socioeconomic stability.

 Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a dominant greenhouse gas and has a considerable effect on climate change. Satellite remote sensing is commonly used to acquire atmospheric CO2 concentrations. However, the limited spatial coverage of a single satellite makes the obtainment of full-coverage CO2 data difficult. In this study, a daily dataset of global seamless column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of CO2 (XCO2) was generated with a high spatial resolution of 0.1° from 2016 to 2020, by using a stacking machine learning method. The proposed XCO2 dataset shows a satisfactory performance, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.9697 ppm and correlation coefficient (R) of 0.9868 in the 10-fold cross validation. The spatial validation reveals good generalization ability, with continent-by-continent validation results showing an R greater than 0.93. The proposed dataset reports high consistency and accuracy in the ground-based validation, with an RMSE of 1.0855 ppm. Out of 24 stations, 22 demonstrate a precision of R greater than 0.95. In comparison with two XCO2 model simulations, our reconstructions show a better consistency with ground observations. Spatial analyses at continent, national, and Chinese provincial levels, and temporal trends at daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual scales, are provided. Furthermore, benefitting from the daily temporal resolution, two typical examples of wildfire events, namely the Fort McMurray wildfire and the Blue Cut Fire, are evaluated.

 Urban vegetation, providing critical ecosystem services and supporting biodiversity, is essential for sustainable and resilient cities. Yet its semantic representation in urban digital twins and 3D city models remains inadequate for advanced modeling. Open data standards facilitate interoperable urban modeling. However, the CityGML standard, despite its widespread adoption, provides limited semantic depth for vegetation in its current Vegetation module, constraining dynamic and interdisciplinary applications.To address this, we present the international stakeholder survey evaluation alongside the updated version of the conceptual model of the CityGML 3.0 Vegetation Application Domain Extension (Vegetation ADE v1.1). The ADE enhances semantic richness by introducing extended attributes, feature types, enumerations, and code lists for both SolitaryVegetationObject and PlantCover, including structural components (crown, trunk, root) and dynamic properties via the CityGML Dynamizer module. Additionally, a vegetation management class is established.Refined through feedback from an international stakeholder survey, the model reflects practical requirements from domains including urban studies, ecology, and public administration. The core data modeling structure of ADE v1.0, unanimously supported by survey participants, was retained for ADE v1.1. The new version introduces substantial improvements: 15 attributes were modified, 12 added, and one removed. Nine code lists were revised and one added. Two enumerations were updated. These enhancements ensure ADE v1.1 achieves improved semantic clarity and usability, supporting diverse applications such as vegetation monitoring and adaptive green infrastructure management. This work demonstrates a replicable methodology for participatory standard development and advances the integration of vegetation into data-driven urban digital twins and 3D city models."

 Few-shot change detection in optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar images is a critical task for disaster monitoring. offering significant application value in complex scenarios with extremely limited labeled samples. However, the randomness of disasters causes a notable data distribution shift between public datasets and real disaster scenarios. With only a few annotated image pairs, existing methods struggle to effectively fuse features from heterogeneous images, leading to severe performance degradation. To address this challenge, we propose a Dual-Stage Training framework for Change Detection (DSTCD), specifically designed for few-shot scenarios involving fewer than 20 labeled image pairs. DSTCD first undergoes source task pre-training on a heterogeneous image registration dataset. Subsequently, in the target task stage, it leverages task guided feature transfer module to transfer the structural and semantic features of image registration to the change detection task. This mechanism significantly enriches the feature representations under few-shot conditions, enabling accurate identification of affected areas. To validate its performance, we conducted comparative and ablation studies against eleven state-of-the-art methods on four public datasets covering both urban expansion and water expansion scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that DSTCD achieves a significant performance lead. Its average F1-score surpasses the second-best method by 6.98% in urban expansion scenarios and by 13.09% in water expansion scenarios, proving its superior performance and strong multi-scenario adaptability. Furthermore, robustness analysis of varying training sample sizes and real-world disaster application validation further confirm the method’s practicality and robustness for data-scarce disaster monitoring tasks.

 Potential adverse effects of indoor air quality derived from the extensive and large-scale use of baby crawling and yoga mats have been increasingly recognized. However, the potentiality of chemicals released from these products under various placement orientation has yet to be adequately addressed. To fill this knowledge gap, baby crawling and yoga mats were selected to measure the emissions of hazardous chemicals from specific surfaces under various placement orientations. The results showed that placement directions had considerable impacts on the masses of emitted formamide, diisobutyl phthalate, benzothiazole, and p-bis(2-hydroxyisopropyl)benzene with vertical placement resulting in 1.1–3.3 times more masses than horizontal placement (p < 0.05). In comparison, the amounts of emitted chlorinated paraffins, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, and di-(2-ethylhexyl)terephthalate were comparable between the vertical and horizontal placements (0.80–1.8 times). The increased amount of formamide derived from changing placement orientation (50–60 %; from horizontal to vertical) was greater than that from temperature-induced emission (10–20 %; from 25 °C to 35 °C). The mats with waterproof layer on surface were more effective in hindering formamide emissions compared to those with bossed patterns and untreated surfaces. When yoga mats were rolled up and placed vertically, the concentrations of chemicals emitted indoor were equivalent to or even greater than those emitted from horizontally placed mats during use, even though the exposed areas were reduced. The present study demonstrated that placement direction is a pivotal factor in regulating chemical emissions, with significant implications for improving indoor air quality."

 Stable nitrogen isotope analysis serves as a powerful tool for tracing the sources and transformation pathways of nitrogen-containing aerosols, which significantly influence atmospheric chemistry, climate change, and environmental processes. This review comprehensively synthesizes the application of stable nitrogen isotopes for the analysis of various forms of nitrogen in atmospheric aerosols, including ammonium, nitrate, and organic nitrogen, as well as atmospheric nitrous acid (HONO). We summarize key measurement techniques and analytical frameworks, with a particular emphasis on stable isotope mixing models-especially Bayesian methods-for source apportionment and the evaluation of isotope fractionation. The review delineates distinct stable nitrogen isotope signatures of major sources (e.g., fossil fuel combustion, agriculture, biomass burning) and elucidates the spatiotemporal variability of isotopic compositions driven by anthropogenic activities and natural processes. Despite advances in the stable isotope analysis of nitrogen-containing aerosols, several challenges remain, particularly concerning nitrogen isotope fractionation processes and the complexity of organic nitrogen species. Finally, we propose that future studies should refine the database of isotope characteristics from various sources, enhance the analytical precision of measurement techniques, and integrate multi-method approaches to better understand nitrogen cycles and mitigate the environmental impacts of nitrogen-containing aerosols."

 As key tropospheric parameters, zenith total delay (ZTD) and precipitable water vapor (PWV) serve as core data supports for precise positioning of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), meteorological monitoring, and disaster early warning. However, existing observation and estimation methods generally suffer from technical bottlenecks, including insufficient spatiotemporal resolution, poor real-time performance, and data blind spots. To address this problem, this study proposes a novel retrieval method based on the Pangu-Weather system, aiming to achieve 7-day high-precision real-time forecasting of PWV and ZTD with 1 km resolution over the China. Using ERA5 reanalysis data as the initial field, the Pangu-Weather system is utilized to forecast meteorological parameters for the next 7 days, and preliminary PWV and ZTD products (Pangu-PWV, Pangu-ZTD) are obtained through integral calculation. Subsequently, based on GNSS data, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) is employed to establish the mapping relationship between latitude, longitude, digital elevation model (DEM), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), time, and tropospheric parameters. The Pangu products are calibrated to the ground height, generating high-precision PWV and ZTD products with 1 km resolution (MLP-PWV, MLP-ZTD). Accuracy verification results indicate that the RMSE between MLP-PWV and GNSS-PWV is 3.63 mm, and the R2 is 0.95. For MLP-ZTD and GNSS-ZTD, the RMSE is 26.55 mm and the R2 is 0.99, both demonstrating excellent spatiotemporal consistency. Application analysis using typhoon Doksuri in 2023 as a case study shows that MLP-PWV can accurately depict the spatial distribution of PWV during hazardous weather processes, overcoming the limitation that Pangu-PWV is unable to reliably calculate PWV above the Earth's surface. This study provides reliable data support for real-time monitoring of tropospheric parameters with high spatiotemporal resolution."

Results show that the polar stratospheric temperature increased from 1992 to 2000, contrary to the expectation of stratospheric cooling due to rising CO2. The study concluded that changes in ozone and CO2 drive the meridional eddy heat transport, dictating polar stratospheric temperature behavior. 
 To predict the future state of the Earth system on multiyear timescales, it is crucial to understand the response to changing external radiative forcing  (CO2 and Ozone). Analyzing the Northern Hemisphere (NH) winter stratospheric polar vortex temperature, we found a general temperature decrease in the reanalysis data (1982–2020), the expected trend with increasing CO2, except for a sharp warming during the period 1992–2000. Results from 1° GEOS-MITgcm coupled general circulation model simulations of past decades show a similar increase in the NH polar stratospheric temperature during 1992–2000 and a decrease during 2000–2020. To isolate the influence of external forcing, we conducted a series of 30-year-long “perpetual” time-slice experiments in which the external forcing for a particular year is held fixed at its values for 1992, 2000, and 2020. Each simulated year of these perpetual experiments is forced with the CO2, Ozone, anthropogenic aerosol emissions, and trace gases of that year, but none of the simulations include any explosive volcanic forcing. The increasing and then decreasing temperature trend is also manifest in the CMIP6 historical simulations performed with models that include a well-resolved stratosphere. The configuration of the perpetual experiments rules out a direct response to volcanic emissions or a change in the phase of decadal modes of variability as explanations for the warming rather than the expected cooling behavior. Analysis of the temperature budget showed (only significant terms are discussed) that the polar stratospheric temperature behavior is dictated by meridional eddy transport of heat resulting from changes in CO2 and Ozone over the past decades."

Comparing Hong Kong and London, we found climate warming boosts isoprene and future ozone pollution, but strong cuts in anthropogenic emission could limit this impact. 
 Isoprene, the globally most abundant volatile organic compound, significantly impacts air quality. Determining isoprene concentration variations and their drivers is a persistent challenge. Here, we developed a robust machine learning framework to simulate isoprene concentrations, without requiring localized emission inventories and explicit chemistry. Temperature, radiation, and surface pressure were the primary drivers of short-term isoprene variations across Chinese cities. On climatic timescales, urban greenspace expansion and climate warming drove isoprene increases by 341 pptv in Hong Kong during 1990–2023, but traffic emission reductions in London counteracted the isoprene rise that climate warming would have otherwise caused (−755 pptv vs. +31 pptv). Driven by rising temperatures and isoprene levels, ozone would increase by up to 1.7-fold by 2100 under the high-emission scenario. However, ambitious reduction in nitrogen oxides would alleviate this growth to 1.2-fold. The study has the potential to inform air quality management in a warming climate."

We were able to develop a product for this instrument that produces results compatible with a more recent instrument, allowing them to work together in future analyses. 
 Herein, we describe an approach to retrieve free tropospheric columns of peroxyacyl nitrates (PANs) from radiances observed by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). AIRS has provided daily global coverage since its launch in 2002, making the AIRS data a valuable long term record. Although the instrument is very radiometrically stable, the radiance noise level is large enough to present a challenge when retrieving a weak absorber such as PAN. To address this, spectral windows were selected to minimize interference from other species as much as possible and a set of filters was developed to predict whether a PAN value retrieved from AIRS is within 0.2 ppb or 50 % of what would be retrieved from the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) and to remove spurious signals caused by specific surface features or clouds. We show that AIRS is capable of retrieving PAN plumes with very high concentrations of PAN (such as those from significant wildfires) that have similar spatial extent as seen by CrIS and that PAN retrieved from AIRS has good correlation with CrIS given sufficient averaging. We conclude with recommendations for users to help ensure that these data are used appropriately."

 The Tibetan Plateau (TP), known as the “Asian Water Tower”, plays a critical role in the regulation of the water cycle in the region. Obtaining high spatiotemporal resolution, and all-weather total precipitable water (TPW) data is essential for understanding water vapor transport mechanisms, improving precipitation forecasting, and managing regional water resources over the TP. However, existing single-sensor remote sensing techniques cannot provide high spatiotemporal resolution TPW data under cloudy conditions. Multi-source fusion approaches often produce anomalous distributions in the fused TPW data due to inter-sensor biases, particularly over the complex terrain of the TP. This study proposed a multi-source remote sensing TPW fusion framework that integrates TPW products from eight microwave satellites and the Himawari-8/9 (H8/9) geostationary satellite to produce an all-weather TPW data with the highest spatiotemporal resolution at present. Methodologically, two correction strategies were developed. First, a bias correction approach was proposed using H8/9 TPW data as a reference to calibrate multi-source microwave remote sensing TPW and reduce inter-sensor discrepancies. Second, an adaptive correction method was created to improve the accuracy and spatial continuity of the fused TPW data under cloudy conditions. Based on the newly developed fusion framework, an all-weather TPW dataset with hourly temporal and 0.02° spatial resolution covering the TP from 2016 to 2022 was produced for the first time. The new dataset has been published by the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center and is available at: https://doi.org/10.11888/Atmos.tpdc.301518 (Ji et al., 2025b). Taking the 2017 product as an example, it was verified against GNSS TPW. The RMSE of the fused TPW product at the hourly scale was 3.79 mm, which was 10.82 % and 6.19 % lower than MIMIC-TPW2 and ERA5, respectively.

Using satellite imagery, we mapped their distribution, finding most of them in southern Peru, above 4800 m a.s.l. and conditioned mainly by low temperature and precipitation. This dataset helps scientists to follow the evolution of permafrost and local planners to manage water resources and risks in the mountains. 
 Rock glaciers are key periglacial landforms in high mountain systems, serving as indicators of permafrost, contributors to mountain hydrology, and sentinels of climate change. Despite their scientific and practical importance, detailed knowledge of their distribution, characteristics, and dynamics in the Peruvian Andes remains limited. This study presents the Peruvian Rock Glacier Inventory (PRoGI v1.0), – a comprehensive inventory of rock glaciers covering the entire Peruvian Andes, encompassing their spatial distribution, morphological attributes, and topoclimatic controls. Unlike previous local-scale studies, PRoGI v1.0 provides national-scale coverage using standardized methods aligned with International Permafrost Association (IPA) guidelines and updated data. Using sub-meter satellite imagery (Bing Maps 2024 and Google Earth 2017) and IPA classification standards, we mapped 2338 rock glaciers with a total area of 94.09 ± 0.05 km2. Approximately 31 % of these landforms were classified as active, 49 % as transitional, and 20 % as relict. They predominantly occur between ∼ 4416 and 5783 m a.s.l. (mean elevation ∼ 4999 m) on slopes averaging ∼ 20.7° (range 7–37°). Spatially, rock glaciers are concentrated in the southern Peruvian Andes, with sparse distribution in central and northern Peru. Most have a southern to southwestern aspect (predominantly S, SW, and SE-facing), and the lower limit of permafrost (indicated by the lowest active rock glacier fronts) is ∼ 3541 m a.s.l. Our inventory serves as a benchmark dataset that significantly advances the understanding and monitoring of mountain permafrost, and it provides a basis for assessing the hydrological importance of rock glaciers in the Peruvian Andes under climate change scenarios.

 Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a critical air pollutant with significant environmental and human health impacts, yet global and long-term NO2 datasets with daily continuity and fine spatial resolution remain limited. In this study, we construct a continuous global daily NO2 concentration spanning from 2005 to 2023 at a 0.1-degree resolution using the advanced Air Transformer deep learning framework that integrates satellite observations, ground-based measurements, meteorological reanalysis, land-use information, and auxiliary geophysical variables. The resulting dataset shows robust performance across diverse regions and pollution regimes, with improved spatial consistency and reduced biases relative to existing global products. Based on this dataset, we characterize the spatiotemporal evolution of global NO2 concentrations over the past two decades. Global annual mean NO2 increased from 2005 to 2015, followed by a moderate decline during 2016–2019, a pronounced decrease in 2020 associated with COVID-19–related reductions in economic activity and transportation, and a partial rebound thereafter, reaching 3.38 ppbv in 2023. The Northern Hemisphere and tropical regions largely followed the global trend, whereas the Southern Hemisphere exhibited distinct behaviour, with relatively stable or declining NO2 levels prior to 2015, a sharp decrease in 2020, and a stronger post-pandemic rebound during 2021–2023. As one of the global, multi-decadal NO2 datasets with daily resolution, this dataset provides a valuable resource for air quality assessment, exposure analysis, and atmospheric model evaluation."

 Accurate estimates of long-term surface temperature (ST) changes are fundamental not only for assessing observed warming, but also for improving the reliability of future climate projections. However, substantial missing information in global ST datasets, remains a major source of uncertainty in estimating global or regional temperature changes.  Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have promoted the effective application of deep learning approaches, such as image inpainting and transfer learning, in reconstructing incomplete geophysical datasets. In this study, partial convolutional neural network (PConv) models were trained using the 20CR reanalysis data and CMIP6 climate model outputs as training samples, with the aim of achieving a proper reconstruction of the global surface temperature dataset. To address differences among existing sea surface temperature (SST) datasets, we reconstruct global monthly ST fields since 1850 by merging the China global Land Surface Air Temperature (C-LSAT2.1) dataset with Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature (ERSSTv6) dataset and Met Office Hadley Centre's sea surface temperature (HadSST4) dataset, respectively. Although both reconstructions reliably reproduce large-scale spatial patterns and long-term variations, the merge of C-LSAT2.1 with HadSST4 exhibits greater physical consistency and is therefore adopted as our preferred reconstruction. In particular, validation against station observations indicates that the reconstructions perform well over the Antarctica after 1961, where observational coverage is extremely sparse. Based on this framework, we developed the China global Artificial Intelligence Reconstructed Surface Temperature20CR/CMIP6 (C-AIRSTR/M) datasets, providing spatially complete global monthly ST anomaly reconstructions since 1850 with a spatial resolution of 5° × 2.5°. These datasets offer improved support for extending long-term climate records and for applications in polar climate assessment, as well as in climate monitoring, detection, and attribution studies.

However, long-term, high spatiotemporal resolution data have been lacking. Hence, multi-source remote sensing was integrated with high-resolution crop distribution and phenology within a detailed water footprint framework. ChinaCropWF provides daily, 1-km resolution blue and green water footprints for China's five major food crops from 2001 to 2020. 
 Increasingly unsustainable water use in food systems and rising regional water scarcity jointly pose a critical challenge to food security. Advancing sustainable agricultural water management requires accurate quantification of crop water use, including the contributions of blue and green water and their spatiotemporal dynamics throughout growing seasons, the absence of which impedes reliable estimation of agricultural water requirements and the improvement of water management practices. Here, we integrated multi-source remote sensing datasets with high-resolution crop distribution and phenology data within a detailed water footprint accounting framework. This approach generated in ChinaCropWF (Hua and Wang, 2025; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18057808), a 1-km, nationwide, daily-resolution dataset spanning 2001–2020, which quantifies blue and green water footprints for China's five major crops. Our dataset shows the total crop water footprints ranked as rice (139.65–193.65 Gm³) > maize (130.22–140.98 Gm³) > wheat (61.15–64.59 Gm³) > soybean (32.05–35.39 Gm³) > potato (0.15–11.31 Gm³). The blue and green water composition was primarily determined by crop-specific traits and regional precipitation regimes. In contrast to the global increase in blue water footprints, China's blue water footprints for major food crops have declined, despite pronounced spatial heterogeneity. By contrast, green water footprints have increased widely across all major cropping regions. By capturing spatial heterogeneity in water volume and use efficiency, ChinaCropWF provides data support for adaptive irrigation, regional water management, and food-water nexus assessments."

It uses a sectional approach for size and composition, includes a wall-loss module, and links gas-phase mechanisms of different complexity to secondary organic aerosol formation. Representation of particle phase composition allows viscosity and non-ideality to be taken into account. 
 SSH-aerosol is developed to represent the evolution of primary and secondary pollutants in the atmosphere by processes linked to gas-phase chemistry, aerosol dynamics (coagulation, condensation/evaporation and nucleation) and intra-particle reactions. The representation of process complexity can be adjusted based on the user's choices.The model uses a sectional size distribution, and offers the capability to discretize chemical composition to account for the mixing state of particles. The algorithms are designed to represent the evolution of ultrafine particles: conservation of mass and number during numerical resolution, taking into account the Kelvin effect, the condensation dynamics of nonvolatile compounds, and nucleation. Different parameterizations are provided for nucleation: binary, ternary, heteromolecular and organic nucleation depending on the compounds involved.For gas-phase chemistry, schemes of different complexities can be handled: from simple schemes to model ozone, oxidants and inorganic chemistry (e.g. CB05, RACM2, Melchior2), to more complex schemes, e.g. from the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM). The complexity of the schemes used for secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation may also be adjusted: from schemes built from chamber data to near-explicit schemes from MCM. SOA schemes reduced using the GENOA algorithm are also provided for several precursors (toluene, a sesquiterpene and three monoterpenes), together with their evaluation against chamber or flow-tube experiments. A wall-loss module has also been added for easier comparisons to chamber experiments.Specific developments were made in version 2.0 to automatically link the chosen gas-phase mechanism to SOA formation by using the SMILES structure of organic compounds, allowing for the determination of their hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties and for the partitioning in both organic and aqueous phases. The gas/particle partitioning may also be represented with different complexities. For the organic phase, viscosity may be modelled, adapting the aerosol viscosity to its composition, and coupling organic and inorganic thermodynamics. The dynamic evolution of the partitioning may be computed explicitly or thermodynamic equilibrium may be assumed. Different options are also provided to simulate the chemistry of organic compounds inside the particles with different types of reactions: irreversible 1st order reactions, bulk oligomerization, hydratation of aldehydes and reactions of organic compounds with inorganic ions.The SSH-aerosol model may be installed with a docker for standalone use. It has also been coupled to several 3D models to represent gas and aerosol concentrations: from the local scale with computational fluid dynamic and street network models to the regional scale with chemistry-transport models."

Here, we quantify halocarbon emissions from the New York City region during the East Coast Outflow airborne campaigns in 2018 and 2020. We quantify urban-scale emissions using discrete airborne flask samples collected during downwind plume sampling. We find that inventories of the urban region underestimate halocarbon emissions. For A/C species, higher emissions in 2018 correspond with higher temperatures, suggesting emissions may vary with appliance usage. The climate impact (100-year time horizon) of our observed halocarbon emissions is comparable to coincident methane emissions, equal to ∼10% of urban CO2 emissions. Without leakage mitigation and effective phase-down efforts, high halocarbon emissions could undercut the benefits of switching to heat pumps and present a positive warming feedback with increasing air conditioning demand."

Mineralogical, biological, and geochemical characteristics of aerosols collected over two years from the southwest Greenland Ice Sheet indicate that aerosols delivered via dry deposition and in snow primarily consisted of silicate minerals, with mean particle diameters of 1.01 ± 1.58 μm (2016) and 0.76 ± 0.87 μm (2017) for dry deposition and 2.4 ± 3.2 μm for dust delivered in snow (2017). The rare earth element signature of the delivered dust was typical of nearby Greenlandic lithologies, and combining this with other geochemical results and airmass history modeling indicated that the airborne mineral dust collected on-ice was likely from local emission sources, namely nearby proglacial plains. Dust and snow deposition rates were used to estimate phosphorus delivery to the ice surface at a rate of 1.2 mg·m–2·year–1, which could fuel estimated pigmented glacier ice algal cell abundances of 8.6 × 103 cells·mL–1, a value consistent with glacier ice algal bloom cell densities documented in the region. The eukaryotic communities in air and snow samples were dominated by algae and fungi, respectively, with both sample types also hosting various bacteria. These results suggest that the airborne transfer of glacier ice and snow algae may be a method by which fresh cryosphere surfaces become inoculated with these pigmented organisms. Collectively, these findings highlight the biogeochemical links between aerosols and the ice sheet surface, which have impacts on glacier ice algal growth and the corresponding surface ice albedo and melting."

In this work, we used the Donnan membrane technique to determine the Cd equilibrium isotope fractionation that is induced by the chelation of Cd with low-molecular weight organic ligands. While a model ligand with oxygen and nitrogen functional groups (EDTA, R-OH, R-NH) induced no significant isotope fractionation between complexed and free Cd2+ (Δ114/110CdCdEDTA – freeCd = −0.08 ± 0.12‰; n = 4), the model ligand with sulfur donor groups (DMPS, R-SH) induced a strong isotope fractionation (Δ114/110CdCdDMPS – freeCd = −0.66 ± 0.20‰; n = 4).

The generation of NCD is comprehensively influenced by meteorological factors and environmental conditions. However, the potential impacts of global climate change on NCD emissions in the coming decades remain unclear, which hinders scientific understanding of their future trajectory. In this study, we developed an integrated method combining wind and fugitive dust emission calculations, based on multisource data sets. Through scenario-based analyses spanning a historical baseline (2001–2024) and future climate projections (2030, 2060) under Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, we systematically quantify spatial and temporal NCD emission patterns across China while evaluating their dynamic interplay with anthropogenic particulate sources. Our findings reveal critical insights: NCD emissions in China exhibit a gradient spatial distribution, decreasing progressively from the north to the south. Influenced by climate differences, these emissions also display distinct seasonal patterns. Projected inventories indicate that an intensification of northern NCD emissions by 2060 is primarily a function of increasing temperatures, contrasting with anthropogenic particulate matter reductions driven by air quality policies. This divergence positions NCD as the principal particulate constituent in northern urban clusters. Taking the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) region as an example, future NCD emissions of PM2.5 and PM10 may reach 42.4 to 303.98% and 140.45 to 844.27% of anthropogenic emissions, respectively. While uncertainties persist regarding climate change and dust–climate feedback, our work provides the first empirical evidence of NCD’s escalating dominance in China’s pollution regime."

Wilkinson,Characterizing Atmospheric Emissions of Particulate Matter from Copper Smelting through Coriolis-μ Air Sampling and Single Particle ICP–MS Analysis,"New methods of air sampling and analysis are needed to better understand atmospheric emissions from industrial sources. To close this knowledge gap, 80 air samples were collected around a copper smelter in Quebec using a Coriolis-μ device, allowing for rapid, spatially and temporally resolved samples. Airborne particles were collected directly into water allowing for (a) precise total elemental quantification by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP–MS) following acidification and (b) analysis of individual particle compositions by single particle ICP-Time-of-Flight-MS (spICP-ToF-MS). This new combination of sampling and analytical techniques allowed for better interpretation of the timing, magnitude and elemental signature of emissions from the smelter. Orders-of-magnitude changes in elemental concentrations including As, Pb, and Cd occurred on time scales as short as 15 min, as revealed by high resolution sampling. Furthermore, strong correlations were observed in both bulk elemental concentrations and particle number concentrations (PNCs) among chalcophile elements, including Cu, As, Cd, and Pb. Distance transect sampling further demonstrated the utility of the Coriolis, with 12 sites sampled on a single day. The downwind persistence of airborne metal(loid)s was measured as far as 6 km from the smelter. The coupling of Coriolis sampling with spICP-ToF-MS analysis provided further insights into emission sources of the submicron particles. A consistent proportion of As- and Pb-bearing particles with respect to co-occurring major elements was observed over time, even as PNCs varied by up to 66-fold; this suggested a single source responsible for the majority of the particles. The multielement particle signatures, including In and Sn present with As, Sb, and/or Bi, and a lack of Cu in many of the trace element particles suggested a smelting origin."

Horowitz,Interpreting Changes in Global Methane Budget in a Chemistry‐Climate Model Constrained With Methane and Isotopic Observations,"The continuous increase in atmospheric methane (CH4) concentrations over the past few decades has become a major concern due to its strong role as a greenhouse gas contributing to climate change. In this work, we investigate the changes in the global methane budget using a global chemistry‐climate model constrained with methane and its isotopic observations. We apply spatially‐resolved isotopic signatures to better constrain the methane sources and include methane‐hydroxyl radical (OH) feedback to better represent methane sinks and lifetime in the model. While anthropogenic activities are found to be mainly responsible for the methane increase since the 1980s, the increasing OH trend simulated by the model plays a critical role in the global methane evolution. We find the observed post‐2006 shift of δ13CH4 can be explained by increases in 13C‐depleted agricultural and waste emissions in the tropics, coupled with decreasing 13C‐enriched biomass burning emissions and an increasing OH trend. We also find post‐2006 emission increases in energy and agriculture sectors are large enough to offset the increasing sinks (due to increasing OH), and therefore are shown to contribute to the post‐2006 renewed methane growth. With CH4‐OH feedback included in the model, the results show an increasing sensitivity to emission increases on methane concentrations and lifetime. Our study underscores the importance of OH in the global methane evolution. Neglecting changes in OH could potentially lead to misinterpreting emission changes with respect to the long‐term observations of methane and δ13CH4."

The whistler wave packets show distinct propagation properties, propagating at a different velocity from the SLAMS and approaching it from upstream. Eventually, the SLAMS merges with the wave packets, altering its structure and forming a new ramp characterized by an intensified magnetic field and plasma density.

The strong correspondence between these measurements and remote retrievals from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment–Fourier Transform Spectrometer provide robust validation of the satellite's capability to monitor stratospheric OCS globally. We demonstrate how trends in the tropical tropopause layer and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration OCS surface data reveal a post‐2016 ∼8% global decline in OCS abundance, which is absent from many global climate models. New simulations with a revised planetary boundary layer OCS abundance show improved agreement with remote retrievals and in situ data across multiple stratospheric layers, but remaining model biases highlight the need for additional in situ OCS observations. The revised representation reduces the stratospheric sulfate burden, resulting in an increased shortwave solar flux at the tropical tropopause by as much as 0.3 Wm−2 locally, with implications for stratospheric circulation, radiative forcing, and climate feedbacks."

While not statistically significant, we also find that TCs that encounter more warm than cold‐core eddies display a higher global‐mean intensity and intensification rate. The differing impact of warm‐core and cold‐core ocean eddies are consistent with coherent differences in sea‐surface cooling prior to peak intensity.

Based on a Lagrangian‐based understanding of SM and ST memories, this study explores the characteristics of SM and ST memories using ERA5‐Land reanalysis data, observations, land surface model and WRF model. The results show that SM and ST memories are longer in North China, Northeast China, Northwest China and Qinghai‐Tibet Plateau than in other regions of China, even exceeding 10 months. In the southern part of China, memories are short, approximately 0–6 months. SM memories have similar spatial distributions at different soil depths over 12 months, as do ST memories. The WRF‐simulated memories show generally consistent spatial patterns with ERA5‐Land but are lower in some regions. Moreover, SM and ST anomalies mainly persist in the form of subsequent SM and ST anomalies, respectively. The relationships between the memories and land surface fluxes exhibit distinct characteristics in arid and wet regions. The memories of SM anomalies are longer in frozen soil, non‐flood season and the arid‐humid transition zone. Additionally, SM and ST memories are characterized with clear monthly and decadal variations, which may be related to some oceanic and atmospheric patterns.

Accurate prediction of wind and turbulence is essential for optimizing the efficiency and reliability of offshore wind farms; however, boundary layer flows in the offshore environment can be complex. To address this challenge, our study uses an advanced three‐dimensional planetary boundary‐layer (PBL) scheme within the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to predict hub‐height wind and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) for the Northeast US offshore region. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of sub‐kilometric, gray‐zone mesoscale WRF simulations with measurements of hub‐height wind and TKE, buoyancy and wind shear taken at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's Air‐sea Interaction Tower (ASIT). Our evaluation for different synoptic forcings, clustered based on self‐organizing map analysis, revealed a good agreement between the predicted and observed hub‐height wind speed, while the hub‐height TKE evaluation had mixed performance. TKE was generally overpredicted in stable conditions, especially for strongly forced nodes with predominant southerly flow. In contrast, the model performed well in weakly forced, northerly flow regimes, regardless of stability. The overprediction of TKE under stable conditions was linked to misclassification of atmospheric stability, a known limitation in stable boundary layer parameterizations."

In China, ground‐level ozone pollution remains a persistent air quality concern despite decreasing concentrations of other air pollutants in recent years. China's commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2060 is expected to result in unprecedented reductions in air pollutant emissions in the future. This study investigates the combined impacts of anthropogenic emission reductions and future climate change on the evolution of summertime surface O3 under China's carbon neutrality target and the ambitious global 2°C warming scenario. Model simulations reveal an approximately 43% decline (range 31%–49%) in summertime daily maximum 8‐hr average (MDA8) O3 in China's six heavily polluted key regions from 2020 to 2060. However, risk of rebound is also projected in some near years due to weather‐driven accelerated O3 production rate, enhanced biogenic volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions and atmospheric stagnation, partially offsetting emission reduction benefits. The substantial aerosol reductions (by over 80%) would also enhance MDA8 O3 (up to 10 ppb) from 2020 to 2060 primarily via heterogeneous reactions on aerosols. The high O3‐temperature sensitivity poses challenges to O3 mitigation in the short term, with frequent heatwaves or droughts dampening the outcomes of ongoing anthropogenic emission control. In the long term, O3‐temperature sensitivity would be reduced by nearly half thanks to continuous anthropogenic emission control, thereby gradually increasing O3 climatic resilience. Quicker and stronger emission control, especially for the anthropogenic VOCs, would significantly mitigate short‐term rebound risks."

C. Yemele,Global subsidence of river deltas,"Spatially variable surface-elevation changes across 40 global deltas using interferometric synthetic aperture radar are reported. 
 River deltas sustain dense human populations, major economic centres and vital ecosystems worldwide1,2. Rising sea levels and subsiding land threaten the sustainability of these valuable landscapes with relative sea-level rise and associated flood, land loss and salinization hazards1–3. Despite these risks, vulnerability assessments are impeded by the lack of contemporary, high-resolution, delta-wide subsidence observations4. Here we present spatially variable surface-elevation changes across 40 global deltas using interferometric synthetic aperture radar. Using this dataset, we quantify delta surface-elevation loss and show the prevalence and severity of subsidence in river deltas worldwide. Our analysis of three key anthropogenic drivers of delta elevation changes shows that groundwater storage has the strongest relative influence on vertical land motion in 10 of the 40 deltas. The other deltas are either influenced by multiple drivers or dominated by sediment flux or urban expansion. Furthermore, we find that contemporary subsidence surpasses absolute (geocentric) sea-level rise as the dominant driver of relative sea-level rise for most deltas over the twenty-first century. These findings suggest the need for targeted interventions addressing subsidence as an immediate and localized challenge, in parallel with broader efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change-driven global sea-level rise. Spatially variable surface-elevation changes across 40 global deltas using interferometric synthetic aperture radar are reported."

Witstok,Little red dots as young supermassive black holes in dense ionized cocoons,"The highest-quality JWST spectra reveal that little red dots are young supermassive black holes shrouded in dense cocoons of ionized gas, where electron scattering, not Doppler motions, broadens their spectral lines. 
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered many compact galaxies at high redshift with broad hydrogen and helium lines, including the enigmatic population of little red dots (LRDs)1,2. The nature of these galaxies is debated and is attributed to supermassive black holes (SMBHs)3,4 or intense star formation5. They exhibit unusual properties for SMBHs, such as black holes that are overmassive for their host galaxies4 and extremely weak X-ray6–10 and radio6,11–13 emission. Here we show that in most objects studied with the highest-quality JWST spectra, the lines are broadened by electron scattering with a narrow intrinsic core. The data require very high electron column densities and compact sizes (light days), which, when coupled with their high luminosities, can be explained only by SMBH accretion. The narrow intrinsic line cores imply black hole masses of 105−7M⊙, two orders of magnitude lower than previous estimates. These are the lowest mass black holes known at high redshift, to our knowledge, and suggest a population of young SMBHs. They are enshrouded in a dense cocoon of ionized gas producing broad lines from which they are accreting close to the Eddington limit, with very mild neutral outflows. Reprocessed nebular emission from this cocoon dominates the optical spectrum, explaining most LRD spectral characteristics, including the weak radio and X-ray emission14,15.

 Emissions from deforestation and savannah fires can travel over long distances and contribute to nutrient deposition in intact tropical forests, where phosphorus limits productivity. The magnitude of this deposition and its influence on the carbon sink, however, remain uncertain. Here we used satellite- and model-based geospatial datasets with feature importance analysis to quantify the influence of fire-derived nutrient inputs on Amazon rainforest productivity. Atmospheric transport modelling indicated that plumes originating in the southern arc of deforestation deliver aerosols into the Amazon basin, creating a south-to-northeast gradient in phosphorus deposition across the Amazon rainforest. This gradient in phosphorus deposition aligned with spatial patterns in sun-induced fluorescence, a proxy for gross primary productivity. We show that long-term phosphorus deposition was the strongest predictor of gross primary productivity, accounting for 22.5% of total spatial variability, and was linked to gains of 7.4 gC m−2 yr−1 per 1 mg P m−2 yr−1 deposited. Our results demonstrate that fire-derived deposition can alleviate chronic nutrient limitations in undisturbed tropical forests and influence spatial patterns of productivity.

Pope,Parameterising the effect of human occupancy and kinetic energy on indoor air pollution,"Parameterising the effect of human occupancy and kinetic energy on indoor air pollution 
 Indoor air quality (IAQ) is increasingly recognised as one of the most important aspects for public health, workplace safety and productivity. While indoor and outdoor factors both influence indoor pollutant levels, human presence and activity are key drivers of the emission of specific pollutants, including particulate matter (PM), total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) and carbon dioxide (CO2). This study investigates the relationship between occupancy, physical activity measured by kinetic energy (KE), and air pollution concentrations in a real-world office setting, by combining data from air quality and radar motion sensors. Two exemplar office spaces were investigated, comprising an open-office area and a meeting room. PM, in the PM1 and PM2.5 size fractions, were found to be highly correlated with the outdoor conditions, whereas PM10 correlates more closely with indoor occupancy (up to r = 0.65). Even higher correlations, up to r = 0.74, were found between human activity, quantified as KE, and the PM10 concentrations. The TVOCs and CO2 showed even stronger correlations with KE (up to r = 0.83), suggesting that these metrics can be used as excellent proxies for estimating certain types of indoor air pollution. Notably, the impact of additional occupants varies depending on room characteristics and usage, underscoring the need for contextualised models of IAQ. By quantifying both outdoor infiltration and indoor emissions, this study offers a framework for disentangling pollutant sources and guiding interventions to optimise IAQ. These insights support evidence-based strategies to create healthier and more productive office environments."

 Climate change and land subsidence are altering relative sea levels and compounding risks across European coasts, yet vulnerability assessments at this scale remain limited. Here we integrate 100-meter Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar measurements (2019–2023) with land-cover, population, and socioeconomic data to assess physical and social dimensions of coastal exposure. Northern Europe shows uplift exceeding 5 mm per year, while subsidence is prevalent in Mediterranean regions. Wetlands experience the largest downward motion (2.3 ± 3.1 mm per year) despite covering a small share of coastal areas. Under a middle-of-the-road climate scenario for 2050, roughly 94,000 square kilometers of coastal land, nearly 25 million residents, and 8 million buildings may face inundation. Vulnerability is disproportionately elevated among older adults, marginalized populations, and economically constrained regions facing heightened exposure yet limited adaptive capacity. These findings provide a scientific basis for directing adaptation resources where physical hazards and social inequalities converge.

 Rice is a staple food for over one billion people in Asia. Understanding rice’s historical thermal limits is critical for predicting its response to future climate shifts. Here, we integrate contemporary records of rice cultivation, archaeological data spanning rice’s long-term history of cultivation, and temperature projections for the past and future to assess how warm temperatures have constrained rice’s distribution and the adaptive strategies used to sustain its production. These thermal limits have remained consistent throughout rice’s domestication history despite its genetic diversification and geographic expansion. Over the past 9000 years, domesticated Asian rice has rarely thrived where mean annual temperature exceeds 28 °C or warm-season maximum temperature exceeds 33 °C. By the end of this century, projections estimate that the land area exceeding these thermal thresholds could expand by ten to thirty times in Asia’s major rice-producing nations. Rice-dependent regions face unprecedented challenges in maintaining this staple crop under projected warming.

 Rainfall pulses generate rapid increases and subsequent declines in soil moisture (SM), yet global ecosystem responses during SM dry-downs remain poorly quantified. Using 6502 soil dry-down events identified from global eddy-covariance observations, we compared carbon fluxes during dry-downs (treatment) to fluxes during the same periods without dry-downs in other years (control). During early dry-downs days, gross primary production (GPP) and respiration both exceeded controls, with stronger GPP gains enhancing net carbon uptake. This enhancement persisted for several days before diminishing as SM decreased and atmospheric dryness intensified. Latent and sensible heat fluxes also rose initially, but latent heat enhancement weakened over time, accompanied by enhanced sensible heat. Machine-learning analyses show that photosynthetic capacity and radiation drive positive GPP anomalies, while water limitations induce negative ones. Satellite data supported these patterns, whereas Earth system models underestimate their magnitude. These findings highlight transient pulse responses and support the broader applicability of the pulse-reserve paradigm.

 Air temperatures are rising across the globe, with polar regions experiencing greater increases compared to the global average, which may be mirrored in water temperatures of freshwater ecosystems. We hypothesized that freshwater wetlands could be sensitive barometers of climate change because atmospheric conditions may exert a stronger control on these wetlands than in previously studied streams. Here, we used nine years of paired air and water temperatures from 20 ponds across two subarctic wetland complexes in Alaska to fit Bayesian models of air-water relationships and then projected future changes in water temperature. Ponds showed strong air-water coupling, highlighting their vulnerability to thermal stress. Maximum mean annual temperatures of 18-22 °C were forecast under IPCC Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5, with an 80-90% probability of exceeding the thermal threshold for coho salmon growth within this century.

 Spatially explicit predictions of species distributions can inform ecosystem processes and conservation, particularly under global change. While imaging spectroscopy could enable accurate species classifications, accuracy generally declines outside training regions, limiting its utility for regional-scale mapping. To investigate mechanisms constraining classification generalizability (e.g., spatial autocorrelation, local adaptation), we used National Ecological Observatory Network Airborne Observation Platform imaging spectroscopy data collected across riparian systems in Arizona, Colorado, and Utah. We extracted canopy spectral data of Populus fremontii (Fremont cottonwood), a foundation riparian tree known to form locally adapted ecotypes across its range, and spatially co-occurring species from seventeen 6 × 6 km sites. Combining this library with site-level environmental data, and support vector machine (SVM) models, we observed that environmental, not geographic, distance between training and test sites limited classification generalizability. Specifically, differences in mean annual temperature, winter precipitation, and spring precipitation, key drivers of local adaptation of P. fremontii, were associated with lower classification accuracy (∼50% lower). We then evaluated specific wavelength regions for improved generalizability. Classification models using only near-infrared (750–1400 nm) and shortwave infrared (1400–2500 nm) outperformed those using full-spectrum models in regions not represented in the training data, consistent with lower heritability in visible and red-edge wavelengths. In conclusion, spatially structured spectral phenotypes of P. fremontii, shaped by local adaptation and acclimation to environmental conditions, reduced species classification generalizability. By integrating ecology into remote sensing workflows, such as spectral band selection, we can improve species classification accuracy, thereby advancing scalable biodiversity monitoring and conservation efforts."

 Accurate and updated maps of rubber plantations are beneficial to eco-environmental and socio-economic impact assessment and sustainable agroforestry management. However, existing remotely-sensed approaches to identifying rubber plantations primarily rely on phenological signals from time-series optical data, which are limited by persistent cloud cover, regional phenological variability or inconsistency, and high data demands. To address these challenges, here, we propose an innovative phenology-independent framework that integrates a rubber plantation index (RPI) with an unsupervised Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) classifier. The RPI is a structure sensitive index derived from dual-polarized Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter (VV/VH) and Sentinel-2 SWIR reflectance (Band 11), capturing plantation regularity and canopy moisture characteristics. We evaluated the RPI-GMM framework across six diverse sample areas of rubber plots in tropics representing variations in phenology, topography, and plantation structure. Results demonstrated high classification accuracy, with F1 scores over 0.87 under both phenologically strong and weak conditions, as well as across mountainous and fragmented landscapes. Our RPI-GMM method achieved an overall accuracy of 87.0% in Laos, and estimated 234,206 ha of rubber plots in 2024. Spatial analysis revealed that approximately 70% of rubber plantations are located in Laotian border areas near China and Vietnam, 90% are situated at elevations below 1000 m, and 80% are found on slopes with gradients ranging from 3° to 16°. Notably, our simple and integrated method of RPI-GMM requires no temporal or labeled data, ensuring robustness, cost-efficiency, and transferability. The results highlight valuable insights of structure-based SAR-optical fusion for future global or tropical monitoring of tree-plantation dynamics and support broader applications in agroforestry management."

A theoretical time-resolved model (TPM) was utilized for IPP modeling, driven by either diurnal photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard Himawari-8 (H8) or daily PAR from MODIS. Preliminary evaluation against in situ measurements corroborated the superiority of AHI-based daily IPP estimation over MODIS, attributed to the robustness of AHI PAR data across varying sky conditions. Satellite IPP products were generated in the full-disk area of H8 between 2016 and 2019 under “daily-to-monthly-to-annual” (DtA) and “monthly-to-annual” (MtA) scenarios for comparison, using other requisite daily and gap-free biogeochemical products. Our analysis unveiled moderate spatiotemporal discrepancies between DtA-based IPP products from AHI and MODIS, confirming an overestimation in MODIS-derived monthly (< 8%) and annual total IPP (∼5%). In contrast, under the MtA scenario, MODIS substantially overestimated monthly (∼14–30%) and annual total IPP (∼20%) and gave biased temporal trends (∼1.3–1.6 times higher) compared to DtA-based IPP estimates of AHI. The discrepancies between IPP products were largely subject to the cloud-induced variabilities in daily PAR products and ocean color data coverage. By upscaling our results to the global ocean, it is anticipated that the annual total IPP previously estimated from MODIS with TPM-like models is overestimated by at least 19%. This study emphasizes the necessity of modeling IPP at finer timescales using high-frequency observations and provides insights for improving IPP quantification with the aid of geostationary satellites."

 Accurate mapping of forest (F) and non-forest (NF) areas is essential for ecological assessment, resource management, and deforestation monitoring. However, complex backgrounds, severe class imbalance and redundant features continue to limit the accuracy and efficiency of network segmentation. To overcome these issues, we present ForResANeXt, a novel semantic segmentation network that uses Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery for forest/non-forest mapping. The model incorporates an AResCAB to enrich contextual feature representations while reducing redundancy and a lightweight embedded attention module to improve positional awareness. Furthermore, attention-gated skip connections suppress background noise and emphasize key spatial information, and a Focal Dice Loss function mitigates the impact of severe class imbalance. Experimental results demonstrate that ForResANeXt achieves a mIoU of 95.31%, surpassing U-Net and mainstream CNN variants in recall and F1 score for the minority non-forest class. It also outperforms several representative advanced CNN architectures and Transformer-based models in terms of Boundary IoU and Small Object Recall. Qualitative comparisons further confirm its superior capability in preserving structural details and delineating complex boundaries with reduced misclassification. Cross-regional transfer experiments validate the model’s robustness and generalization capability across diverse geographical and temporal conditions, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each proposed component. Overall, ForResANeXt shows great promise for efficient and accurate forest cover mapping using multispectral satellite data."

 Accurate individual tree crown (ITC) segmentation is essential for quantifying forest fine carbon stocks. However, deep learning segmentation methods face prohibitive annotation costs while unsupervised algorithms struggle in structurally complex forests. This study proposes a semi-supervised framework integrating unsupervised pseudo-label generation, deep instance segmentation, and staged fine-tuning to overcome these limitations. The framework transforms outputs from marker-controlled watershed (MCWS) and region-growing (itcSegment) algorithms into initial training targets to obtain generalizable instance segmentation representations, then refines Mask R-CNN models with minimal manual annotations to enhance structural awareness of instance boundaries and semantic context understanding, significantly reducing labeling dependency while improving robustness. Validated across three structurally heterogeneous Chinese fir stands spanning age (11–67 years), density (450–2500 stems·ha−1), and elevation (192–1047 m) gradients, our UAV RGB-based framework achieved consistent superiority over LiDAR and fused inputs, with spectral-textural features proving dominant for boundary delineation. It attained F1-scores of 0.826 (young, undulating terrain), 0.836 (mature, high-density), and 0.711 (over-mature, occluded) using only 40 % expert annotations (0.6 personnel-hours), representing a 0.42 average improvement over MCWS/itcSegment baselines. The designed staged fine-tuning strategy effectively mitigated pseudo-label error propagation, while expanding this annotation effort to 70–100 % yielded marginal accuracy gains, demonstrating exceptional efficiency in leveraging minimal supervision. Based on the segmented crowns, structural parameters were extracted with high fidelity: crown diameter (R2 ≥ 0.76, rRMSE ≤ 11.3 %) and crown area (R2 ≥ 0.88, rRMSE ≤ 16.4 %). This approach reduces annotation demands while maintaining robustness across forest heterogeneity, enabling operationally scalable solutions for precision forestry."

 As a common precursor to both fine particulates (PM2.5) and O3, ambient volatile organic compounds (VOCs) require accurate source tracing to enable targeted emission reductions. This study developed an enhanced source tracing framework integrating four key components: (1) gridded speciated sampling at 80 stations across the Pearl River Delta (PRD), China, conducted from 2021 to 2023; (2) an optimized Positive Matrix Factorization model with source-specific species pairs and their initial ratios determined from a localized database to account for VOC photochemical aging; (3) a multi-site spatial aggregation weighted potential source contribution function for tracking emission hotspots; and (4) a novel method to quantitatively assess the influences of emission and meteorological condition on inter-campaign variability in VOC levels. Nine major VOC sources were identified, with solvent use (30.2 %), gasoline vehicle exhaust (16.7 %), and industrial process (12.3 %) being the dominant anthropogenic sources. Regionally, emission reductions were the primary driver of the declining contribution from gasoline vehicle exhaust. In contrast, meteorological conditions exhibited location- and campaign-specific impacts, and even counteracted emission-driven trends in some cases, especially in the coastal area such as Hong Kong. The surge in solvent use contributions across the PRD during Campaign 4 was mainly meteorology-driven, whereas Dongguan's spike was primarily emission-driven. Industrial process contributions showed a meteorology-driven bimodal pattern, exemplified by Hong Kong where upwind transport led to a 17.7-fold concentration increase during Campaign 2. This source tracing framework enables high-resolution mapping of VOC emission variations, thereby providing robust scientific support for formulating dynamic, location-specific VOC mitigation strategies."

 Sun–sky radiometer (model POM-01) is commonly used for studying aerosol optical and physical properties at selected aerosol-specific channels. Although the instrument is equipped with a precipitable water vapor (PWV) channel at 940 nm, the inbuilt software does not provide a tool for estimation of PWV. Hence, the current study adopted a new methodology to estimate PWV from three high-altitude (> 3400 m MSL) sites, Hanle, Merak, and Leh, located in Ladakh, India. The retrieval algorithm focuses on the precise estimation of the calibration constant (V0) and coefficients a and b using modified Langley plots in two different methods. The estimated average value of b is 0.59 ± 0.09 which is very close to those commonly used in global studies. Further, the estimated V0 and b values from both methods are found to be similar, which may be due to the advantages of the dry and high-altitude environment, where the annual total column water vapor is typically less than 6 mm. The estimated PWV using observations at selected full clear and stable atmospheric conditions compares well with satellite, AERONET, GPS, reanalysis and empirical model data with correlation coefficient varying from 0.91 to 0.97. Further, the estimated propagated root mean square error (rmse) varies from 0.37 mm to 2.58 mm. These results indicated that sun–sky radiometer derived PWV showed good consistency with the derived PWV from independent data sources at the three sites."

 The COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 represented a unique opportunity to evaluate the way reduced traffic may influence air pollution levels. In the present study, this analysis is performed in the Veneto region, northeastern Italy, one of the most polluted areas in Europe, in the eastern Po Valley. During the first month of the COVID-19 lockdown period, the concentrations of fine particles (PM10) fell by 20–25% in the area, which corresponded to a 30–40% decrease in NO2 emissions, mostly attributed to lower traffic volumes.In order to understand if the specific atmospheric conditions of the period affected the decrease in PM10 concentration, meteorological data from ground stations and radio-soundings, together with ERA5 reanalysis data, were analysed to better define the role of meteorology in the reduced pollution concentrations. The analysis does not identify significant changes in the meteorological conditions.The improvement in the concentrations of PM10 during the lockdown period emphasizes the potential benefits of traffic reduction in achieving air quality goals. Unfortunately, current policy plans are insufficient, failing the 39% reduction in traffic emissions declared as necessary by the Veneto region to comply with EU standards. This consideration highlights the urgent need for significant changes in traffic management strategies in the region."

 Accurately monitoring atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations is essential for understanding the carbon cycle and formulating effective emission reduction policies. Although satellite remote sensing has achieved notable progress in retrieving column-averaged CO2 (XCO2), challenges such as data discontinuity and limited spatial resolution persist. To address these issues, we propose a novel spatiotemporal reconstruction framework—GAM-Optuna-ERT—which integrates the Generalized Additive Model (GAM), Extremely Randomized Trees (ERT), and the Bayesian hyperparameter optimization tool Optuna. GAM captures the temporal and spatial variation trends of XCO2 and provides an initial background estimation; the ERT model effectively learns complex interactions among high-dimensional features to enhance prediction accuracy; Optuna automates hyperparameter tuning, thereby improving model robustness. Using OCO-2 satellite observations in conjunction with multi-source driving variables—including meteorological factors, vegetation indices, carbon emission inventories, and population density—we reconstruct monthly, seasonal, and annual XCO2 distributions over mainland China from 2015 to 2020 at a spatial resolution of 0.05° × 0.05°. Validation against TCCON, WDCGG, and CAMS datasets demonstrates the model's high accuracy and stability. Furthermore, quantitative analysis using the Geodetector method reveals that the synergistic effects of vegetation photosynthesis and anthropogenic activities are key drivers of the spatial heterogeneity in XCO2. This study provides a technical foundation for high-resolution XCO2 reconstruction and offers strong support for carbon monitoring and policymaking under China's “dual carbon” strategy."

The denuder efficiently removed alkanes and weakly functionalized acids, aldehydes, and alcohols with fewer than 10 carbon atoms from the gas phase. Denuding organic compounds perturbed the CCN-derived hygroscopicity parameter by up to 50%. Denuding either rendered the particles more or less CCN active, and the direction of the effect depended on sample relative humidity and trace gas concentration. The effect was weakest in early spring and strongest in late spring and summer. The measurements demonstrate an unexpectedly strong coupling between the particle and gas phase, influencing CCN activity through either volatilization or surface adsorption, or both."

While El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) winter sea surface temperature anomalies influence global climate, their effect on subsequent autumn LESS ice remains unclear. This study reveals a post-2000 intensification of winter ENSO’s impact on subsequent autumn LESS ice, driven by accelerated ENSO phase transitions compared to the pre-2000 era. Rapid phase transitions of El Niño after 2000 generate persistent cold anomalies in the tropical central–eastern Pacific during the subsequent autumn, strengthening and displacing the Western North Pacific anticyclone (WNPAC) northward. This WNPAC triggers Rossby waves establishing an Arctic anticyclone, warming, and moistening the LESS atmosphere, thereby driving substantial ice loss. In contrast, pre-2000 slower El Niño decay exhibited weaker tropical-Arctic connectivity.

The resulting flux estimates reveal pronounced seasonal and spatial patterns driven by agricultural activities and indicate substantial local deposition to surrounding vegetation, underscoring the need for improved monitoring and management strategies. 
 Atmospheric ammonia (NH3), primarily emitted from agriculture, poses significant threats to ecosystems, climate, and human health through nitrogen deposition and secondary aerosol formation. NH3 flux estimates remain highly uncertain due to limited direct observations and complex emission–deposition processes. Here, we estimated NH3 fluxes over the contiguous United States using satellite observations from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI, 2008–2022) and Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS, 2012–2022) by applying a directional derivative approach. Our results highlight major agricultural emission hotspots, including the San Joaquin Valley in California, the Snake River Valley in Idaho, the Texas panhandle, the Great Plains, Southeastern Pennsylvania, and Eastern North Carolina. NH3 removal is predominantly driven by deposition near source areas rather than chemical transformation, with strong sinks in vegetation-dense regions such as forests, grasslands, shrublands, and wetlands. Seasonal flux variations show peaks in warm months and lower values in winter, driven by temperature-dependent volatilization from livestock production and fertilizer application. Compared with bottom-up inventory, satellite-based estimates capture general spatial and seasonal patterns, while also revealing additional insights into key flux hotspots and peak periods. CrIS consistently reports higher fluxes than IASI, especially in spring, reflecting differences in their overpass times.  Combining IASI (morning overpass) and CrIS (midday overpass) observations enables a better understanding of diurnal NH3 flux dynamics. These findings provide critical insights into NH3 spatiotemporal variabilities, complementing inventory-based approaches and informing nitrogen management and environmental policy, particularly in regions with limited ground-based monitoring."

Using a state-of-the-art model under the most extreme scenario in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, we find that the tide strengthens between 20–70 km but weakens between 90–110 km. The increase likely reflects lower density and stronger tropical convection, whereas the decrease is consistent with enhanced diffusion. 
 We investigate the impacts of increased CO2 concentration on migrating diurnal tide (DW1). A future climate simulation is conducted using a WACCM-X model, with surface CO2 levels increasing according to the RCP8.5 scenario. The DW1 (1,1) mode, a propagating tide peaking near the equator, exhibits a statistically significant positive trend in a range of 20–70 km, and a significant negative trend in a range of 90–110 km. The positive trend is likely driven by a reduction in atmospheric density in the mesosphere and enhanced equatorial convective activity, while the negative trend appears in the mesosphere, which overwhelms the positive trend. Two potential mechanisms may explain the negative trend. First, increasing CO2 enhances mesospheric stability, reducing tidal vertical wavelengths. In our simulation, equatorial temperatures around ∼50–70 km become cooler than those in ∼70–90 km. This strong cooling could be linked to CO2 mixing and transport, as well as the contraction of the mesospheric ozone layer due to atmospheric descent induced by CO2-driven cooling. Second, stronger convective activity intensifies gravity wave generation, increasing gravity wave diffusion in the mesosphere. This strong convective activity also likely intensifies the tide below ∼70 km. While our positive DW1 trend is consistent with McLandress and Fomichev (2006), the negative trend in the lower thermosphere contrasts with their results. This discrepancy might arise because their model used a time-independent diffusion coefficient, whereas WACCM-X accounts for CO2-driven changes in gravity wave diffusion. The negative trend is confirmed in SABER observation for the last two decades, while the positive trend is not verified."

This improves fog monitoring by distinguishing fog from low clouds, which satellites alone cannot reliably do. Our results reveal diurnal patterns and linkages to coastal proximity in the vertical dynamics of fog and low clouds, highlighting key atmospheric processes with potential importance for future research. 
 In the hyper-arid Namib Desert, fog serves as the only regular source of moisture, vital for sustaining local ecosystems. While fog occurrence in the region is typically associated with the advection of marine stratus clouds and their interaction with topography, its spatial distribution is strongly influenced by cloud base height, which remains poorly understood. To address this gap, this study utilizes ground-based remote sensing and in-situ observations to analyze systematic spatial and temporal patterns of cloud base height. Our results reveal clear seasonality and a diurnal cycle, with cloud base lowering moderately (10–50 m h−1) during the evening and early night, and lifting rapidly (30–150 m h−1) after sunrise, especially inland. Additionally, the findings indicate that these rates are influenced by horizontal gradients in cloud thickness. Quantile regression highlights the tight relationship between cloud base height and near-surface relative humidity (r≈-0.76) that is expected in well-mixed boundary layer, which can therefore be employed to estimate cloud base height across FogNet sites. In a case study, the potential value of the estimated cloud base height for separating fog from low clouds in satellite-based products is shown. In the future, a full integration of the estimated cloud base height with a  satellite-based fog and low-cloud product can enable a spatially continuous mapping of fog in the region for the first time, which would facilitate fog ecological impact studies."

To guide regulation aimed at mitigating their impacts, it is important to know their emissions. We used satellite observations of formaldehyde and glyoxal, combined with a chemical transport model, and demonstrate that VOC emissions are about 20 % larger than expected; furthermore, unknown chemical pathways must be invoked to explain the observations. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are key precursors of tropospheric ozone and secondary organic aerosols, a major component of PM2.5, and several aromatic VOCs are toxic. Glyoxal is a short-lived oxidation product of many VOCs, yet global models consistently underestimate its abundance, indicating a substantial missing source. Here, we derive improved estimates of global biogenic, pyrogenic, and anthropogenic VOC emissions and new constraints on the atmospheric glyoxal budget, based on the first joint inversion of TROPOMI formaldehyde and glyoxal columns using the adjoint of the MAGRITTEv1.2 chemical transport model. For 2021, the global NMVOC flux is estimated at 1070 Tg yr−1, 19 % above bottom-up estimates, partitioned into 749 Tg from vegetation, 102 Tg from biomass burning, and 219 Tg from anthropogenic activity. Emissions of anthropogenic glyoxal precursors are 43 % higher globally when constrained by satellite data compared with inventory-based simulations, with large underestimations in India, China, and Africa. The total glyoxal source is estimated at 100 Tg yr−1, of which 41 % originates from unidentified VOCs, predominantly biogenic and concentrated in the Tropics. Likely contributors include poorly represented formation pathway in isoprene oxidation under low-NOx conditions and an underestimated contribution of monoterpenes. Validation against Pandonia Global Network, in situ, and MAX-DOAS datasets confirms improved agreement of the satellite-constrained model relative to the model based on inventory data alone."

Our results reveal that elevated NOₓ levels enhanced the daytime SOA volatility by modifying gas-particle partitioning, particularly through suppressing the production of low-volatility organic vapors. In contrast, photochemical aging was associated with reduced SOA volatility. 
 Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is an important component of organic aerosol (OA), yet its atmospheric evolution and impacts on volatility remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the volatility of different types of SOA at a downwind site of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region in the fall of 2019, using a time-of-flight chemical ionization mass spectrometer coupled with a Filter Inlet for Gases and Aerosol (FIGAERO-CIMS). Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis was performed on the thermogram data of organic compounds (referred as FIGAERO-OA) measured by the FIGAERO-CIMS.  Eight factors were resolved, including six daytime chemistry related factors, a biomass burning related factor (BB-LVOA, 10 % of the FIGAERO-OA), and a nighttime chemistry related factor (Night-LVOA, 15 %) along with their corresponding volatility. Day-HNOx-LVOA (12 %) and Day-LNOx-LVOA (11 %) were mainly formed through gas-particle partitioning. Increasing NOx levels mainly affected SOA formation through gas-particle partitioning, suppressing the formation of low-volatile organic vapors, and thus promoting the formation of relatively high volatile OA with a higher N : C ratio. Two aged OA factors, Day-aged-LVOA (16 %) and Day-aged-ELVOA (11 %), were attributed to daytime photochemical aging of pre-existing OA. In addition, the daytime formation of Day-urban-LVOA (16 %) and Day-urban-ELVOA (7 %) could only observed in the urban plume.  Results show that both gas-particle partitioning (36 %) and photochemical aging (30 %) accounted for a major fraction in FIGAERO-OA in the afternoon during the urban air masses period, especially for high-NOx-like pathway (∼ 21 %). In general, the six daytime OA factors collectively explain the majority (82 %) of daytime SOA identified by an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS). While BB-LVOA and Night-LVOA accounted for 13 % of biomass burning OA and 48 % of nighttime chemistry OA observed by AMS, respectively. Our PMF analysis also demonstrated that the highly oxygenated OA and hydrocarbon-like OA cannot be identified with FIGAERO-CIMS in this study. In summary, our results show that the volatility of OA is strongly governed by its formation pathways and subsequent atmospheric aging processes."

 Isotope measurements are increasingly used to constrain the methane (CH4) budget on various scales, from global to regional. The success of isotope-based source attribution depends to a large degree on the knowledge of the isotope signatures of the various source categories at the point of emission, but this information is in many cases lacking. Here we report the isotopic composition of CH4 emitted from 48 installations in the gas production region of Transylvania, Romania. The isotopic source signatures are quite homogeneous across the basin with average values of δ13C = (−65.6 ± 0.5 ‰) and δD = (−184 ± 1 ‰) confirming the predominantly biogenic origin of the Transylvanian gas, produced by hydrogenotrophic CO2 reduction. This is similar to values reported previously from natural seeps in Transylvania, to the natural gas exploited in the Dolj region in Southwestern Romania, and to the natural gas in the distribution grid in Cluj-Napoca. However, is more depleted in heavy isotopes than the oil-associated gas emitted in the Southern Romanian Plain, and gas leakages in the city of Bucharest. In addition, we present a step-by-step derivation of the underlying “Keeling plot” mass balance approach that is used to derive isotope source signatures."

They may be measured by applying algorithms to satellite images of the Earth. We attempt to apply data from the new Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) satellite to the existing XBAER algorithm, which was previously applied to data from the Ocean Land and Colour Instrument (OLCI) satellite. This paper compares the satellite inputs and aerosol outputs of the XBAER algorithm and finds good results. 
 New high-resolution hyper and multispectral satellite instruments enable the retrieval of aerosol optical depth (AOD) at spatial resolutions of tens of meters. The eXtensible Bremen AErosol Retrieval (XBAER) AOD retrieval algorithm has previously been developed for use with Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) and MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) radiance data. With the intention of later modifying XBAER to use the full 30 m spatial resolution data from the Hyper-Spectral Imager (HSI) on board the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) satellite, the present study investigates how HSI data compare to OLCI data. For the bands of interest, top of atmosphere reflectances generally compare well (R>0.9), the intercept of the best fit line is less than 0.05 from the origin, and the slope is less than 0.1 from 1. However exceptions exist and these are explained as the result of differences in the spectral response functions of the instruments in the region of the spectrum around the O2 A-Band absorption feature, or as a result of differences in the viewing geometry of the satellites which produces differing bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) effects. XBAER is then used to retrieve OLCI and HSI surface reflectance (SRF) and AOD. For SRF the comparison between OLCI and HSI yields R=0.953, best fit intercept =0.003 and best fit slope =1.082. The respective comparison for AOD yields R=0.809, best fit intercept =0.153 and best fit slope =0.785. These comparisons are then separated by surface type and insights are gained into the performance of the algorithm. Finally, the unmodified XBAER algorithm is run using the full spatial resolution HSI data. Plumes from biomass-burning are identified in a single scene, and a comparison with AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) AOD is performed for multiple scenes, achieving R=0.631."

 Africa is a critical source of biomass burning (BB) aerosols, and its importance is increasing. The African Combustion Aerosol Collaborative Intercomparison Analysis (ACACIA) Pilot Project set to optically characterize BB aerosol generated from sub-Saharan African fuels. We used a photoacoustic spectrometer as a reference instrument to determine the multiple-scattering correction factor Cλ for an AE33 aethalometer at three wavelengths, which produced weighted mean values of C370=3.69, C470=5.65, and C520=6.39. Cλ increased with wavelength and C370 was statistically independent of the others, suggesting a single Cλ is insufficient, especially in BB scenarios. While a dependence of Cλ on burning state was not found, Cλ was shown to strongly relate to particle single scattering albedo (SSA, ω). When Cλ was plotted against SSA, values slowly rose at low SSA values, followed by a sharp rise around an SSA of ∼ 0.9; indicating a larger correction needed for less absorbing aerosol. A number of functions operating on either SSA or Cλ were explored and the best function was -Cλ/(1-Cλ)=Aω+B. This is an important parametrization of Cλ specifically geared towards BB aerosol from African fuels under different aging states, and is of particular importance for future field work in that continent. An Ångström matrix plot shows that African BB aerosol can have values more akin to dust, which demonstrates that these fuels are distinct in their wavelength dependence from more typical BB aerosol. Lastly, we examined the mass extinction and absorbance cross sections for BB aerosol generated for the same fuels with two different tube furnace setups. Not only is this combustion method flexible, it was found to be reproducible between labs."

Trepte,CALIPSO 1064 nm calibration biases inferred from wavelength-dependent signal attenuation by stratospheric aerosols,"This paper assesses biases in the 1064 nm calibration of the Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) due to signal attenuation differences at 1064 and 532 nm caused by stratospheric aerosols. Multi-channel measurements from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment suggest the bias ranges from 1 %–2 % for background conditions to over 5 % for high aerosol loads. Implications for CALIOP 1064 nm extinction retrievals and cascading errors in multi-layer scenes are discussed. 
 Calibration of lidar signals at 1064 nm from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) onboard Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite depends on the prior calibration of the primary 532 nm channel. However, the 1064 nm calibration procedure also requires knowledge of the ratio of stratospheric signal attenuations at 1064 and 532 nm, which is not available a priori and thus is assumed to be 1. This assumption introduces a potential bias in the computed 1064 nm calibration coefficients. In this work we assess this bias by using independent multi-channel occultation retrievals of stratospheric aerosol extinction from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE III) on the International Space Station (ISS) for the period 2017 onwards. We also use the GLObal Space based Stratospheric Aerosol Climatology (GloSSAC) to provide a historical background during the SAGE II era (1984 through 2005). The results show that the magnitude of the CALIOP 1064 nm calibration bias is less than 1 %–2 % within the tropics under stratospheric background conditions. However, recent biases can be as high as 5 % when volcanic perturbations and/or pyro-cumulonimbus (pyroCb) injections dominate the stratospheric aerosol loading. We explore the effects of this bias on CALIOP's level 2 science retrievals by estimating the anticipated perturbations in cloud-aerosol discrimination (CAD) performance and by quantifying the non-linear propagation of errors in CALIOP's 1064 nm extinction coefficients. This global characterization of the spectral attenuation differences should provide useful information for future spaceborne elastic lidars operating at 1064 nm."

GeCGO and GeoNEXTools could help scientists use geostationary satellite data at ground observational sites of interest. 
 The latest generation of geostationary satellites provide Earth observations similar to widely used polar-orbiting sensors but at intervals as frequently as every 5–10 min, making them ideal for studying the diurnal dynamics of land–atmosphere interactions. The NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) group created the GeoNEX datasets by collating data from several geostationary platforms, including GOES-16/17/18, Himawari-8/9, and GK-2A, and placing them on a common grid to facilitate use by the Earth science community. Here, we document the GeoNEX Coincident Ground Observations (GeCGO) dataset for terrestrial ecosystem studies and provide examples for its use. Currently, GeCGO provides GOES-16 Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) data over a 10 km × 10 km area surrounding 1586 network sites across the Americas. GeCGO makes it easy to compare the time series of geostationary data with the diurnal ground observations, including carbon/water fluxes and aerosol optical depth, and is extensible to other regions. We also develop GeoNEXTools to facilitate analyses that require both GeoNEX data and other NASA satellite data. The objectives of this paper are to introduce GeCGO and GeoNEXTools and demonstrate their applications. First, we describe the details of GeCGO and GeoNEXTools. Second, we explain how GeCGO can be integrated with other satellite data. Finally, we showcase comparisons between GeCGO and observations from three ground-based networks.

Over two decades, these restored lands captured 21.77 million metric tons of carbon, Grasslands contributed over 80 % of this carbon storage, highlighting their critical role in climate mitigation. 
 The soil organic carbon pool is a crucial component of carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems, playing a key role in regulating the carbon cycle and mitigating atmospheric CO2 concentration increases. To combat soil degradation and enhance soil organic carbon on the Loess Plateau, the Grain-for-Green Program (GFGP) has been implemented. Accurately quantifying change in soil organic carbon stock (ΔSOC) resulting from farmland retirement is essential for informing land use management. In this study, the spatial and temporal distribution of retired farmlands on the Loess Plateau was analyzed using Landsat imagery from 1999–2021. To assess the effects of the years since retirement, climate, soil properties, elevation, and other factors on ΔSOC, climate-zone-specific multivariable linear regression models were developed based on field-sampled soil data. These models were then used to map ΔSOC across the retired farmlands. Results indicated that a total of 39 065 km2 of farmland was retired over the past two decades, with 45.61 % converted to grasslands, 29.75 % to shrublands, and 24.64 % to forestlands. The years since retirement showed a significant positive correlation with ΔSOC, and distinct models were developed for different climatic zones to achieve high-resolution (30 m) ΔSOC mapping. The total ΔSOC from retired farmland on the Loess Plateau was estimated at 21.77 Tg in carbon equivalent, with grasslands contributing 81.10 %, followed by forestlands (11.16 %) and shrublands (7.74 %).

This helps track how the ice sheet is changing as the climate warms. By carefully combining satellite data and checking results by hand, we created one of the most accurate maps of the ice sheet to date. This map supports research on ice loss and improves predictions of future changes in Greenland’s ice and its effect on the planet. 
 The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is losing mass at an accelerating rate in response to climate change. Its geometry responds to these changes over annual to decadal timescales, therefore making accurate and up-to-date mapping of its extent essential for monitoring ice loss, assessing mass balance, and improving climate and glaciological models. Ice margin outlines serve as critical boundary conditions for different types of modelling exercises, hydrological studies, and assessments of ice sheet dynamics. Here, we present the PROMICE-2022 Ice Mask, a high-resolution outline of the contiguous ice masses of the GrIS and the nunataks in its interior as of late August 2022. The dataset was derived from a true-colour Sentinel-2 mosaic at 10 m spatial resolution, generated using the Sentinel Hub Cloud Processing API to select the most recent valid pixels from August 2022. The mapping process was performed manually and supplemented with high-resolution mosaics from Sentinel-2 and SPOT 6/7 provided by the Danish Agency for Climate Data (KDS), along with recent topographic vector data. We mapped the geodesic perimeter length of the GrIS to 53 060 km and its glacierized area, including floating ice, to 1 725 648 km2 with 19 130 nunataks in its interior. The PROMICE-2022 ice mask captures the GrIS margin with an absolute horizontal accuracy better than 20 m. Its quality and consistency make it well suited for applications in ice sheet modelling, hydrology, glacial geomorphology, and long-term monitoring of ice margin change.

By gathering and checking thousands of measurements from around the globe and linking them with flow and rainfall data, the database provides a comprehensive view of water movement, allows scientists to compare regions, understand groundwater processes, and support sustainable water management worldwide. 
 For analysing karst hydrogeological systems, observations of karst springs and cave drips are considered indispensable. In addition to hydrometric observations, knowing the oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope ratios has improved the understanding of vadose zone and aquifer dynamics, likewise supporting system characterisation and modelling. However, limited accessibility and high costs of the analysis of stable isotopes in karst aquifers have hindered progress in karst research and impeded the accurate understanding of karst processes especially when it comes to comparative or large-scale studies. In this study, we present our workflow to compile the WoKaS-Iso database, the first extensive collection of time series data for Oxygen-18 and Deuterium isotopes in karst springs and cave drip water from diverse sources, encompassing publications, theses, reports, online archives, and collaborative initiatives worldwide. The database incorporates data sourced from 236 springs and 74 caves, comprising in total 997 time series (379 time series for the springs and 618 time series for the cave drip water). These datasets provide coverage across significant karst regions globally, spanning China, the USA, Europe, the Middle East, and Australia. Within datasets, 79% for springs and 68% for cave drip water exhibit resolutions finer than monthly intervals. In addition, by integrating isotopic records with ancillary environmental variables including spring discharge, cave drip rate, precipitation, and rainwater isotopes, the database offers a more comprehensive perspective on hydrological behaviours in karst aquifers, hence advancing hydrogeological characterisation and modelling. The WoKaS-Iso database not only deepens the understanding of the complex systems but also promotes sustainable water resource management as well as the potential to foster collaborative research.

The method uses a three dimensional incremental variational approach focusing on the physical relationships between all the state vector variables errors. Testing in the Mediterranean Sea showed that a complex sea level operator based on a barotropic model works best. 
 This study presents the development and sensitivity analysis of the sea level operator within the OceanVar software which implements an oceanographic incremental three-dimensional variational data assimilation scheme. In OceanVar, the background error covariance matrix is decomposed into a sequence of physically based linear operators, allowing for individual analysis of specific error matrix components. The key development of OceanVar2.0 is the full integration of both dynamic height and barotropic model formulations as a flexible option for handling sea level covariance. The comparison of the two formulations of the sea level operator which provides correlations between Sea Level Anomaly, temperature and salinity increments is presented. The sensitivity experiments were performed in the Mediterranean Sea and the quality of the analysis assessed by comparing background estimates with observations for the period January–December 2021. The results confirm the methodological advantage of the barotropic model operator, which successfully overcomes the physical and operational limitations associated with choosing an appropriate level-of-no-motion for the dynamic height formulation. Furthermore, we present a method to assimilate along-track satellite altimetry considering a forecasting model with tides."

We simulate the atmospheric concentration of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and corresponding sulfur deposition fluxes and compare the results with observational data from a satellite instrument and with ground-based in-situ measurements. For the evaluation of the simulated atmospheric lifetime of SO2, we also simulate the fate of SO2 emitted by two volcanic eruptions that happened in 2019. 
 Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a key atmospheric pollutant, primarily emitted through human activities such as fossil fuel combustion. In atmospheric models, accurate representation of SO2 emission sources, transport, and removal processes are essential for evaluating air quality and radiative forcing.In this study, we present, for the first time, a comprehensive examination of atmospheric SO2 simulated by the ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) model, here operated under the Chemistry–Climate Model Initiative (CCMI-2022) protocol. First, the tropospheric sulfur budget simulated by EMAC is verified to be closed. This closure means that all sulfur sources and sinks are balanced and no artificial gain or loss occurs over time due to numerical or conceptual errors. This budget closure is a prerequisite for any further analysis. Second, the results of EMAC simulations are compared with observations from three ground-based networks (the Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTnet), the European Monitoring and Evaluation Program (EMEP), and the Acid Deposition Monitoring Network in East Asia (EANET)), mainly over polluted regions, and with vertical column densities retrieved from a TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board the Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor mission (Sentinel-5P) satellite. The EMAC simulated SO2 concentrations near the Earth's surface for the year 2019 are, depending on the region, between 1.4 and 1.8 times larger than observed. This discrepancy aligns well with the differences between simulated and retrieved satellite-based measurements of SO2 vertical column densities over the same regions. It indicates that the prescribed SO2 emissions used for the EMAC simulations might be overestimated. Over a longer time period (2000–2019), the EMAC simulation reproduces the measured declining trends of SO2 concentrations and deposited sulfur fluxes in the USA and Europe, but fails to simulate the observed trends in East Asia. This is most likely attributable to the prescribed SO2 emission inventories. Furthermore, sensitivity simulations are performed to assess the emitted amount of SO2 following the Raikoke and Ulawun volcanic eruptions in 2019. The results show a very good agreement of the simulated temporal evolution of the amount of atmospheric SO2 after the eruptions with that retrieved from satellite-based observations."

Using virtual potential temperature, a ratio-based cost function, and a microphysics closure, it reduces biases relative to ERA5 and 1D-Var, improves cloud liquid water representation, and enhances heavy rainfall precursors, extending lead times. This approach strengthens continuous profiling and supports high-impact weather nowcasting. 
 Ground-based microwave radiometers (GMWRs) provide continuous thermodynamic profiling but suffer from degraded accuracy under cloudy and precipitating conditions when using classical one-dimensional variational (1D-Var) retrievals. To address this, we develop a thermodynamic-constrained Kalman filter variational framework (TCKF1D-Var) that enforces moist-thermodynamic consistency through the use of virtual potential temperature as the control variable, employs a ratio-based cost function independent of prescribed background and observation error covariances, and integrates a diagnostic microphysics closure to represent liquid and ice water. Validation over 44 GMWR sites in North China, including seven with collocated radiosondes, shows that TCKF1D-Var systematically reduces temperature and humidity biases relative to ERA5 (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis version 5) and 1D-Var, with the largest improvements above 2 km for temperature and below 5.5 km for humidity. Temperature root-mean-square errors remain comparable to ERA5 and lower than 1D-Var below 8.5 km, while humidity errors are improved near the surface though degraded in the mid-troposphere due to vertical-resolution mismatch and channel cross-talk. Evaluation against collocated EarthCARE (Earth Clouds, Aerosols and Radiation Explorer) cloud liquid water content profiles demonstrates that TCKF1D-Var yields the lowest biases and errors and best reproduces observed distributions, confirming the benefit of the microphysics constraint. Case analyses of short-duration heavy rainfall further show that TCKF1D-Var enhances precursor signals of convection, extending the effective lead time for early warning relative to ERA5 and substantially outperforming 1D-Var. These results highlight the value of embedding physical constraints and microphysical closure within GMWR retrievals, offering a practical pathway to improve continuous thermodynamic monitoring and support high-impact weather nowcasting."

In this study, we systematically investigated the variation characteristics in the isotopic composition of water vapor emitted from the combustion of various fuels and initially established the characteristic isotopic signatures of CDWV. The δ18O–H2Ov produced by fossil fuel combustion inherits the isotopic signature of atmospheric O2, resulting in a significantly positive δ18Ov value (> +10‰) and markedly negative d-excessv (< −200‰) characteristic. Through this study, we demonstrated the reliability and universality of the theoretical values of CDWV isotopic composition. Through experiments, we observed the dynamic variations in isotopic compositions and water vapor mixing ratios during fossil fuel combustion processes. The distinct isotopic disparity between the CDWV and the natural water vapor enables us to use d-excessv as a quantitative tracer for estimating the contribution of anthropogenic fossil fuel combustion to atmospheric moisture."

Here, we present high-resolution oceanographic measurements from a submesoscale cyclone in the Western Mediterranean Sea, revealing a pronounced subsurface accumulation of textile microfibers (MFs) within the eddy core (0.34 MF l–1) relative to surrounding waters (0.09 MF l–1). This enrichment persisted in a secondary, smaller cyclone that detaches following the main cyclone’s fragmentation. Elevated chlorophyll-a concentrations in the upper 40 m, driven by isopycnal uplift, point to a coupled biological response to physical forcing. Spatial heterogeneity in pollution sources, vertical circulation, and mixing likely explains the observed microfiber distribution. Our findings demonstrate that submesoscale cyclones can function as transient yet efficient reservoirs of man-made contaminants, with potential consequences for pollutant exposure pathways and trophic transfer in marine ecosystems."

Bell;Nadine Borduas-Dedekind,"Singlet Oxygen and Triplet Excited State Organics Produced by Primary Biomass Burning Organic Aerosol from Wood, Dung, Straw, and Plastic Fuels: Role of Solvent-Dependent Photochemistry","Biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA) is a significant source of brown carbon (BrC), a class of light-absorbing organic compounds that influence the climate and atmospheric oxidation chemistry. Certain BrC chromophores act as photosensitizers by producing reactive oxidants such as singlet oxygen (1O2*) and triplet excited states (3C*) upon solar irradiation, but we still cannot predict which functional groups drive the production of these excited-state oxidants. We hypothesized that since the major sink for O2*1 is solvent deactivation, water-based extractions of chromophores may (1) underestimate O2*1 production in BBOA, as well as (2) overlook water-insoluble chromophores potentially important in hydrophobic aerosol phases. To better represent the multiphase nature of atmospheric aerosols in this work, we employed a cosolvent extraction using acetonitrile and water to extract the hydrophobic fraction of BrC chromophores. Primary organic aerosol (POA) filters from the combustion of beechwood, cow dung, straw, and plastic were collected during the BAMBE campaign and subsequently analyzed using a two-probe photochemical method with furfuryl alcohol and syringol as probes to quantify O2*1 and 3C* steady-state concentrations and quantum yields, respectively, under UVA irradiation. The acetonitrile–water mixture enhanced chromophore recovery and modulated the quenching of the excited state of O2*1 back to O2, leading to up to a 6-fold increase in O2*1 concentrations. Fuel type significantly influenced oxidant yields. Beechwood and plastic extracts showed the highest O2*1 and 3C* production, up to 4.9 ± 0.1% for O2*1 and 4.2 ± 0.2% for 3C*, respectively. Complementary FIGAERO–CIMS analysis revealed compositional differences between fuels and combustion conditions, suggesting that nitrogen-containing species drove the variability in sensitization efficiency. Our findings underscore the importance of solvent selection and fuel source in assessing BrC photochemical activity and offer new insights into the oxidative potential of BBOA in atmospheric multiphase environments."

This study aimed to investigate the impact of multiple air pollutants and meteorological conditions on common ocular diseases utilizing Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) and to delineate the pathogenic relationships among them. We analyzed data from 28,981 hospitalizations in ophthalmology (2019–2024) at a tertiary hospital in Wuhan, China, coupled with daily environmental data for key air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3) and meteorological parameters (temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, precipitation, etc.). Eleven distinct FCM models were developed via differential evolution algorithms to quantify both environment–disease and disease–disease interactions. Our findings indicated that optic neuropathy (ON) exhibited the highest environmental sensitivity, showing a positive correlation with PM10. Besides, positive associations were identified between minimum temperature and glaucoma as well as between CO exposure or temperature and cataract risk. Diseases of the Ocular Surface and Appendages (DOSA) exhibited a robust correlation with precipitation, which was negatively associated with cataract and ON. Analysis of the disease interaction network identified thyroid-associated orbitopathy (TAO) as a central hub, subject to considerable input from other ocular conditions (ON → TAO: n = 59; LDD → TAO: n = 49; DOSA → TAO: n = 57; TAO → U: n = 42; TAO ↔ S: w = 0.45; G ↔ TAO: w = 0.37; OT ↔ TAO: w = 0.72). The most robust bidirectional association was observed between ON and Ocular Trauma (OT) (average weight = 0.93). Overall, this study highlights the effectiveness of FCM for modeling in environmental ophthalmology, revealing that PM10 exerts a critical influence on optic nerve health, while temperature and precipitation serve as vital modulators in glaucoma and cataract pathways. These findings should be interpreted as offering novel insights with implications focusing on future causal validation rather than establishing deterministic relationships. These insights provide quantitative evidence supporting the potential role of environmental factors in ocular diseases, thereby underscoring the need for targeted public health strategies and optimized medical resource allocation to mitigate the ocular health hazards posed by regionally prevalent and seasonal environmentally related eye disorders."

Temerin,Bursty Precipitation of Relativistic Electrons Unveiled by CIRBE/REPTile‐2 Measurements and Their Physical Implications,"Energetic electron precipitation plays a pivotal role in shaping Earth's radiation belt dynamics and drives significant physical and chemical changes in the upper atmosphere. However, the detailed mechanisms governing the loss of relativistic electrons have remained unclear, largely due to the limited energy coverage and coarse resolution of previous measurements. Here we report high‐resolution observations of bursty electron precipitation across a broad energy range (0.3–2.3 MeV), obtained by the Relativistic Electron and Proton Telescope integrated little experiment‐2 (REPTile‐2) onboard the Colorado Inner Radiation Belt Experiment (CIRBE) CubeSat. REPTile‐2 employs a novel instrument design that minimizes background to enable clean spectral measurements with the highest energy resolution achieved to date in low‐Earth orbit for this energy range. During the conjunction events when CIRBE was close to the same field line with Arase satellite at higher altitudes, our analysis shows that pitch angle diffusion driven by chorus waves can fully account for the observed three bursty precipitation events over the entire energy range. These results provide the definitive evidence for a unified chorus‐driven electron loss process acting across a wide energy range and underscore the critical importance of high‐resolution measurements in resolving long‐standing uncertainties in radiation belt dynamics. Furthermore, they offer new insight into the energy‐dependent atmospheric impacts of electron precipitation, with broad implications for space weather forecasting and upper atmospheric chemistry."

Both experiments attained similar peak intensities (∼920 ${\sim} 920$ hPa), but the LES uniquely captured kilometer‐scale rolls in the boundary layer, persistent shallow mesovortices near the eyewall, and countless sub‐kilometer‐scale patches of positive and negative vorticity. Rapid intensification (RI) in the LES was delayed by approximately 26 hr relative to that in the 2 km model. Composite analysis confirmed that mesovortices interfered with the azimuthally averaged secondary circulation. The prevalence of negative vorticity and decelerated inflow in the LES are likely to delay the RI."

Here, we employ a covariance fingerprinting approach to demonstrate that shifts in teleconnection patterns affecting monthly temperatures between the periods 1960–1990 and 1990–2020 are attributable to anthropogenic forcing. We further apply multilinear regression to assess the regional contributions and statistical significance of changes in five key climate modes: the El Niño‐Southern Oscillation, NAO, Southern Annular Mode, Indian Ocean Dipole, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. In many regions, observed changes exceed what would be expected from natural variability alone, further implicating an anthropogenic influence. Finally, we provide projections of how these teleconnections will alter in response to further changes in climate."

However, a series of idealized simulations suggest that significant track deflections can still occur even under a steady steering flow on an f plane. TCs embedded in easterly flows of varying strength systematically deflect southward from the expected westward track when radiative effects are included. The resulting track deflection reaches approximately 200 km in some experiments over a 144‐hr period, comparable to typical 72‐ to 96‐hr forecast errors in global numerical weather prediction model. A potential vorticity tendency analysis reveals that the deflection primarily results from the diabatic heating and horizontal advection terms, each linked to asymmetries in the convection and wind fields, respectively. These asymmetries are initially triggered by vortex–flow interactions and further enhanced by radiative diurnal cycles. Our findings highlight the role of internal vortex asymmetries in modulating TC motion."

Methoxyphenols in the atmosphere are pivotal in modulating climate change, secondary particle pollution, and human health risks. However, the quantity of methoxyphenol emissions from vegetation due to wildfires and their spatiotemporal trends remain unclear on a global scale. Here, we established a global atmospheric emission inventory of methoxyphenol due to wildfires at 0.25° × 0.25° resolution from 2001 to 2020, and clarified their global spatial distribution and seasonal variations. The annual emissions of methoxyphenol released by wildfires globally range from 798.6 to 1385.3 Gg, with Africa being the region with the highest emissions. Among the cumulative emissions of methoxyphenols, the emission of methyl syringol is the highest, reaching 2809.6 Gg. Simultaneously, alkyl and ketone substituents have higher emissions than those of acid substances. For land cover types, the proportion of methoxyphenols emitted from the burning of deciduous broadleaf forests is the highest, possibly because the fallen leaves provide ample fuel for the fire. These findings depict the global methoxyphenol pollution caused by wildfires, providing a foundation for further exploration of the methoxyphenols‐mediated environmental, climate, and health effects from wildfires."

However, the improvement in deep soil simulation remains challenging as limited by the relative shallow penetration depth (< 5 cm). With advancements in satellite RS technologies like P‐band sensors, retrieving deeper SM has become increasingly feasible. Here, we demonstrate the potentially added value of enriched deep soil moisture information in land surface data assimilation (DA) by using ground‐based SM observations from a dense monitoring network in the central Tibetan Plateau. Specifically, a cost function‐based multi‐layer SM DA framework is developed to optimize soil texture profiles and organic matter content. A series of DA experiments were conducted to explore the optimal assimilation and optimization depths. The results suggest that assimilation of top 20 cm SM is adequate to reasonably optimize key soil parameters for all soil layers, and thereby improves SM estimates to the depth of 40 cm. This improvement can further propagate into soil temperature profiles and surface flux (e.g., evapotranspiration) estimates. Besides, the performance of deep SM DA is found insensitive to assimilation frequency varying up to 5 days, highlighting the promise and feasibility of regional land DA with 0–20 cm SM products, which are readily accessible from future satellite missions."

These vortices impact surface weather in various ways, and their dynamics may be affected by recent anthropogenic climate change. However, key aspects of these dynamics, such as the processes of energy and helicity cascading, remain unclear. In this study, we propose a novel approach to studying polar vortex dynamics that considers kinetic helicity. Mainly using ERA5 reanalysis data but also Aeolus Level 2C wind data, we examine the evolution of kinetic helicity in the stratosphere over the Arctic region during winter 2022/23. Our focus is on the formation and stability of the polar vortex, as well as sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs). We find that the polar vortex is strongly helical, with the sign of kinetic helicity depending on the evolutionary stage of the vortex. Our analysis of the kinetic energy and kinetic helicity spectra reveals the presence of dual cascades during vortex formation. The spectral properties of the stratosphere over the Arctic change seasonally and as a function of the magnitude of the kinetic energy and helicity, with spectra being steeper during polar vortex activity. Similar correlations are absent for the spectra in the troposphere. Finally, we found that the evolution of kinetic enstrophy and helicity can predict the occurrence of SSWs with an accuracy of approximately 8 days."

 Near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) are small, airless bodies that orbit in near-Earth space. Recent studies suggest that their surface rocks can undergo crack growth and fragmentation through thermal fatigue induced by diurnal temperature cycling. This process may expose materials yet to be altered by solar wind irradiation and micrometeorite impacts, known as surface rejuvenation. However, the mechanism that generates the initial cracks required to trigger thermal fatigue fragmentation remains poorly understood despite its importance for understanding the geophysical evolution of asteroids. Here we use numerical approaches to show that stony, or S-complex NEAs, the most compositionally common group, can experience rapid temperature changes, or thermal shocks, sufficient to generate microcracks in surface rocks as they pass through the shadow of a terrestrial planet. Our statistical analysis of backward orbital integrations demonstrates that these asteroids pass through planetary shadows more often than they encounter planets closely enough for planetary tides to rejuvenate their surfaces. We also found that shadow passages are shorter than typical asteroid spin periods, indicating that expansion stress from rapid heating occurs immediately after contraction stress from rapid cooling. These results suggest that thermal shock caused by planetary shadows may help trigger the surface rejuvenation of stony NEAs. Stony near-Earth asteroids may undergo fragmentation of surface rocks triggered by thermal shocks as they pass through the shadows of terrestrial planets, leading to surface rejuvenation, according to orbital simulations and thermophysical modelling."

 Hybrid systems that integrate electrochemical CO2 reduction with microbial upgrading offer a viable route to high value organic compounds from CO2 at ambient conditions. However, electrocatalyst deactivation in microbial growth media remains a key barrier, limiting efficiency and increasing cost. Here we show that a bioadaptive single-atom nickel catalyst (Ni SAC), coupled with genetically engineered Clostridium ljungdahlii, enables robust electrosynthesis of isopropanol (IPA) from CO2 via a CO-mediated pathway. Instead of relying on H2 as an electron carrier, the system applies high-rate CO formation in complex growth media, maintaining a tunable CO Faradaic efficiency up to 92%, which is 9.4 to 52.7 times greater than conventional Ag catalysts. This performance supports stable IPA production at current density of 10.8 A/m2 and production rate of 161.3 mg/L/day. In situ Raman and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, together with theoretical calculations, indicate that the Ni SAC can resist competing organic adsorption and retain its coordination structure during CO2 reduction in bioelectrolytes, providing a mechanistic basis for the catalyst stability and integrated process performance.

This study finds that when deciduous forests burn, their carbon losses are driven by weather, but are lower than in conifer forests, potentially dampening climate–fire feedbacks. 
 Climate change is driving more frequent and severe wildfires in northwestern North American boreal forests, initiating shifts from conifer to broadleaf deciduous forest dominance. The resulting forests sequester more carbon and are more resistant to burning. However, when deciduous forests do burn, patterns and drivers of carbon losses are important for predicting long-term carbon storage in boreal forest landscapes. Here we use a combination of field and statistical modelling approaches to quantify carbon combustion losses in burned deciduous boreal forests. On average, deciduous forests lose less than half as much carbon to wildfire combustion as conifer forests per unit burned area. Although deciduous stands are more sensitive to top–down fire weather drivers than conifer stands, carbon loss is always lower than the minimum for conifer stands. This, along with the fire-suppressive effects of deciduous stands, could slow the positive feedback between wildfire and climate in fire-prone boreal landscapes. More frequent fires in the North American boreal are causing shifts from conifer to deciduous forests. This study finds that when deciduous forests burn, their carbon losses are driven by weather, but are lower than in conifer forests, potentially dampening climate–fire feedbacks."

 Accurate monitoring of seasonal to decadal snow cover dynamics is essential for climate change attribution and sustainable water resource management. As part of the European Space Agency (ESA) Snow Climate Change Initiative (CCI+) Phase-2 project, this study introduces an Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) snow cover fraction (SCF) product portfolio, with a particular emphasis on the development of AVHRR10C1.V4—the first 45-year (1979–2023), global, daily SCF product. This dataset achieves unprecedented temporal consistency by addressing long-standing challenges such as orbital drift, inter-sensor inconsistencies, reduced cloud contamination, and enhanced SCF retrieval accuracy. The AVHRR10C1.V4 product was generated by integrating newly calibrated EUMETSAT AVHRR Fundamental Data Record (FDR) data from 16 AVHRR sensors on a 0.05° grid through a calibration method, modified cloud masking, an updated SCF retrieval method, refined post-processing, and a novel consolidation framework. Comprehensive validation against 66 high-resolution Landsat/Sentinel-2 SCF maps and extensive ground-based snow measurements confirms the robust accuracy of the AVHRR10C1.V4 product: root mean square errors of 16–19% for viewable snow cover fraction (SCFV) and 18–28% for ground snow cover fraction (SCFG), with overall accuracy (OA) ranging from 0.80 to 0.92. The consolidation approach remarkably reduces RMSEs by 7%–48% and lowers missing data rates by ∼30% compared to single-sensor products. The product maintains strong temporal consistency with ERA5-Land SCF product (R > 0.8) and in situ snow measurements. Statistical analysis over the 45-year record and multiple separate periods confirms minimal sensor-drift biases, revealing no statistically significant breakpoints or drift trends (Mann-Kendall p > 0.05). While the SCFV product proves robust to variations in viewing geometry and vegetation conditions, SCFG accuracy is more sensitive to forest cover density—exhibiting substantially increased estimation uncertainties in dense forest canopies (forest cover density > 50%) due to canopy radiative effects and the use of static land cover assumptions. This open-access, climate data record–quality AVHRR10C1.V4 product establishes a critical benchmark for studying snow-climate interactions and long-term cryospheric monitoring. It supports the development of next-generation global SCF products, enabling reliable detection of snow trends, improved hydrological modeling, and informed climate adaptation in a warming climate."

 The rapid spread and destructive nature of wildfires and volcanic activity have intensified the need for low latency detection systems. The growing intensity and frequency of globally distributed thermal hotspots have driven the development of satellite-based detection solutions. Conventional approaches rely on ground-based processing, which limits low latency capabilities due to revisit times over ground stations and data handling requirements. This work proposes the first onboard payload processing pipeline for segmentation of thermal hotspots in raw multispectral satellite imagery. The pipeline leverages the Near InfraRed (NIR) and Short-Wave InfraRed (SWIR) spectral bands, and the combination of onboard Artificial Intelligence (AI) and raw imagery significantly reduces the delay between image acquisition and event detection. Furthermore, we present Segmentation of Thermal Hotspots in Raw Sentinel-2 data (SegTHRawS), the first publicly available dataset for thermal hotspot segmentation in raw multispectral satellite imagery. The segmentation model employed is a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) derived from U-Net, named ResUnet-S2, designed for fast on-device inference. This model achieved an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.988 and an F-1 score of 0.986 on SegTHRawS, with its detection and generalization capabilities validated using an external thermal hotspot segmentation dataset. The proposed pipeline was verified on CubeSat-compatible hardware, achieving an end-to-end execution, from image acquisition to event detection, in 1.45 s, faster than the image acquisition process, and consuming a peak power of 4.05 W. These results demonstrate the potential of onboard processing solutions for minimizing the detection latency of current approaches, particularly for thermal hotspot segmentation, using edge computing satellite hardware."

 Cardiovascular exercise is a popular activity that aims to improve physical fitness and overall health, however practicing outdoors enhances pollutant inhalation. The main objective was to estimate the dose received by inhalation of airborne particles during cardiovascular exercise in urban environments. Dosimetry simulations used particle mass concentrations (PM2.5, PM2.5-10) to estimate the deposited dose in the human respiratory tract that assumed a young and healthy adult male and female train at variable activity intensities. Hourly dose rates were substantially increased with activity intensity due to increased inhaled volumes, with a 9.5-fold increase from rest (60 bpm) to high-intensity exercise (170 bpm). PM levels played also a crucial role as increased concentrations were linked with increased deposition rates. Heating, and Sahara events comprised the most burdened cases with unfavorable conditions for exercise. Higher % nasal contribution for female trainees was the reason for higher deposition in the anterior nose compared to male trainees. Linking these results with a health risk showed that females have an increased risk related to a health outcome in the upper respiratory tract whereas male trainees have increased risk for a health impact in the lungs. Overall, health risk analysis verified the negative impact of elevated PM concentrations and the enhanced risk accompanied by increased intensity for experienced trainees. To prevent negative health outcomes, trainees are recommended to practice in areas with reduced particulate pollution (e.g suburban areas) and during times of the day where concentrations are expected to be lower."

 BackgroundSouth Africa experiences high levels of ambient air pollution, with PM2.5 concentrations routinely exceeding WHO guidelines of 5 μg/m3. Early childhood represents a critical window of neurodevelopmental vulnerability, yet the impacts of postnatal PM2.5 exposure on developmental outcomes remain underexplored in this context.MethodsWe analysed nationally representative data on 5222 children aged 50–59 months attending 1248 Early Learning Programmes (ELPs) across South Africa, using the Early Learning Outcomes Measure 4&5 (ELOM) to assess development across five domains. Twelve-month cumulative PM2.5 exposure at each ELP was estimated using satellite-derived, ground-calibrated data. Spatial lag and error models were employed to account for residual spatial autocorrelation.ResultsA 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure was associated with lower total ELOM scores (β = −0.12 SD, p < .05), with the largest associations observed for gross motor development (β = −0.17 SD, p < .01) and fine motor coordination (β = −0.12 SD, p < .05). No significant associations were detected for executive functioning, literacy, or numeracy domains.ConclusionThis study provides evidence of associations between ambient PM2.5 exposure and specific developmental domains in preschool-aged children in South Africa. The findings highlight the need to integrate air quality interventions into early childhood policy and to further research mechanisms, exposure timing, and mitigation."

 Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) has emerged as a well-established atmospheric observing system, with Zenith Total Delay (ZTD) and integrated water vapor routinely assimilated by several global and regional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) centers. While co-derived tropospheric gradients effectively capture water vapor horizontal anisotropy, their assimilation has yet to be widely adopted. Here, we introduce a novel approach for assimilating GNSS tropospheric gradients into the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model by constructing pseudo-ZTD observations from GNSS-derived ZTD and gradient data. Through two comparative experiments, we evaluate the potential influence of GNSS tropospheric gradients on WRF forecasts. The results indicate that assimilating these gradients improves humidity and wind field predictions in the lower-to-middle troposphere (850–500 hPa), with a neutral impact on surface fields. Verification against radar estimates further demonstrates enhanced precipitation forecast skills, particularly for heavy precipitation events, by better resolving the spatial distribution and intensity of precipitation systems. A diagnosis of a precipitation event suggests that the assimilation of GNSS tropospheric gradients is able to adjust the forecast mid-level moisture distribution and modulate the forecast upward motion, thereby influencing the formation of spurious precipitation."

The objectives of this project are to contribute towards a more comprehensive understanding of air quality in Providence and support environmental justice, community health, and greenhouse gas reduction goals. Towards these objectives, Breathe Providence developed an integrated sensor network design approach, balancing both community and scientific priorities in the monitoring site selection process to maximize (1) community investment and collaboration, and (2) data quality and utility. Enabled by partnerships with community-based organizations, guidance from the Providence Climate Justice Plan, and findings from low-cost sensing literature, Breathe Providence’s site selection strategy operated at both the geographic and host-specific levels to prioritize data utility for community members, researchers, and decision-makers alike. The two-stage network design process employed a Providence-based air quality vulnerability index to guide and evaluate network development at a geographic level, and a community-informed definition of ‘meaningful’ to guide it at the sensor host level. The result of these efforts is a network of air monitoring stations throughout Providence that is primarily hosted by community-serving institutions and is weighted towards neighborhoods with higher vulnerability to air pollution. The network successfully represents the priorities of the Climate Justice Plan and community-based project partners on both a geographic and sensor host level. Sensor hosts have become meaningfully involved through the co-planning of public events, which have in turn broadened the project’s channels for public outreach. Scientific considerations were largely compatible with community criteria: by supporting data quality and completeness, they supported the broader policy applicability goals stressed by community partners. The site selection process presents an essential opportunity to build relationships and align monitoring priorities; as a result, it better positions networks to yield community-relevant benefits."

However, comprehensive monitoring of terrestrial ecosystems is challenging, partially because of the fine-scale spatial heterogeneity of land cover and vegetation structure. While forest ecosystems are relatively well studied, knowledge of trees outside forests (TOFs) is limited, even though TOF contribute substantially to many ecosystem services. In this study, we leveraged advances in remote sensing and modeling to quantify TOF and their contribution to the 2011–2023 Maryland state carbon budget. Specifically, the Ecosystem Demography model was initialized with 1 m airborne optical and LiDAR data. These datasets were combined with 30 m National Land Cover Database maps to identify and monitor TOF statewide. In the base year, TOF contributed to 22.86% (2795.59 km2) of the total tree cover, 14.70% (15.98 Tg C) of the total aboveground live tree carbon stocks, and 22.56% (0.39 Tg C yr−1) of the corresponding carbon fluxes in the state, with variation by land cover class. TOF on developed and planted/cultivated lands contributed approximately 90% of the total TOF tree cover and carbon stocks, as well as over 96% of the total TOF carbon fluxes. Most TOF occurred as polygons smaller than 1 km2 and were within 600 m distance from forests. From 2011–2023, persistent TOF carbon stocks were estimated to increase by 5.15 Tg C, representing 23.71% of the state’s total increase in tree carbon stocks over the interval, with substantial interannual variability in carbon fluxes. These results suggest TOF are an important contribution to statewide tree cover and produce carbon stocks and fluxes that should be highlighted in carbon budgets for effective monitoring and assessment. Moving forward, efforts are needed to expand the availability and application of high-resolution remote sensing data and models needed for TOF quantification in carbon budgets."

This study investigates whether the ‘hot’ Earth system models (ESMs) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, whose past warming trends are typically greater than the observations, tend to overestimate future temperature and precipitation changes across the global maize harvesting areas. By applying an emergent constraint (EC) approach to 30 ESMs, we assess the future mean and extreme temperature (ΔTave and ΔTmax) and precipitation (ΔPave and ΔPmax) changes during maize growing seasons. We find that ΔTave, ΔTmax, and ΔPmax averaged over the global harvesting regions are significantly correlated with the past global mean temperature trends, indicating that hot ESMs tend to overestimate the future changes in these variables. ECs reduce the inter-ESM variances in these projections by 43%, 39%, and 18%, respectively. Notably, the regions with the highest maize production, such as the USA and China, are projected to experience the greatest increases in ΔTave and ΔTmax. The fraction of the global maize production exposed to historically rare high temperatures increases substantially in the raw projections but is moderated when ECs are applied. These findings suggest that the use of hot ESMs may lead to overestimated impacts of climate change on maize and that EC methods offer a robust pathway for refining impact assessments."

A critical parameter in most SEB models is the surface temperature of wet or dry boundaries where sensible heat (H) or latent heat (LE) equals 0, which is difficult to measure or estimate. The wide application of SEB models is seriously limited due to this challenge. Therefore, this study introduces ‘critical canopy temperature ( )’, defined as the canopy temperature at which LE equals 0, corresponding to the dry boundary in SEB models. We develop a physics-constrained machine learning (ML) model (hybrid model) that conserves the SEB equation to predict using meteorological measurements from 103 eddy-covariance (EC) stations combined with remote-sensing data. The predicted is integrated into the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) model to replace the dry boundary, thereby to improve the estimation of LE estimation. Results demonstrate that the hybrid model effectively captures canopy temperature anomalies during stomatal closure and achieve better generalization than pure ML approaches in LE estimation, particularly under extreme conditions. Compared with conventional dry-boundary selection scheme without SEB constraints, incorporating significantly improve SEBAL performance, reducing the root mean square error for LE from 119.33 to 81.71 W m−2 against EC observations (at 31.52% reduction). At regional scales, the hybrid model enables pixel-level estimation of , addressing the long-standing challenge of dry-boundary underrepresentation. Overall, the hybrid model provides a robust and accurate framework for predicting theoretical dry-boundary temperatures while conserving the SEB, supporting improved monitoring of vegetation physiological status and enhancing the accuracy of SEB models."

Oman,Beyond binary maps from HCHO∕NO2: a deep neural network approach to global daily mapping of net ozone production rates and sensitivities constrained by satellite observations (2005–2023),"We create long-term maps of PO3 magnitudes along with their corresponding sensitivity maps. This is achieved using a deep learning parameterization method that relies on satellite data, atmospheric models, and ground-based remote sensing. Our approach provides more quantitative information than commonly used methods that depend on ratio-based indicators (such as HCHO/NO2). Additionally, our method considers light and water vapor, making it suitable for applications with GEO satellites. 
 Previous studies on net ozone production rates (PO3) and their sensitivities to precursors relied on limited in-situ data, often coarse and uncertain chemical transport models (CTMs), and ozone indicators like the formaldehyde-to-nitrogen dioxide ratio (FNR). However, FNR fails to fully capture PO3's complex relationships with pollution, light, and water vapor. To address this, we refine the satellite-based PO3 product from Souri et al. (2025) with key advancements: (i) a deep neural network to parametrize high-dimensional non-linear ozone chemistry without the need for empirical linearization of atmospheric conditions, (ii) incorporation of water vapor, (iii) improved error characterization, and (iv) the application of a finer CTM to dynamically convert column retrievals into near-surface mixing ratios. Our PO3 sensitivity maps surpass traditional FNR-based assessments by quantifying sensitivity magnitudes – factoring in photolysis rates and water vapor – with greater spatial information. Our new product provides daily near-clear sky PO3 and sensitivity maps using bias-corrected OMI (2005–2019, 0.25° × 0.25°) and TROPOMI (2018–2023, 0.1° × 0.1°), with values aligning within 10 %. High PO3 rates (> 8 ppbv h−1) appear in urban and biomass-burning regions under strong photochemical activity, including during a heatwave in the northeastern U.S. Photolysis rates are the dominant factor dictating the seasonality of PO3 magnitudes and sensitivities. The stability and long-term records of OMI retrievals (2005–2019) enable us to provide the first global maps of PO3 linear trends showing a surge of > 30 % over China, the Middle East, and India, while a reduction in the eastern U.S., southern Europe, and several regions in Africa."

 Elevated background ozone (O3) poses significant challenges for regional air quality management. Understanding the vertical distribution of O3 and its precursors is critical, yet remains poorly characterized in Southwest China. This study presents the first comprehensive altitudinal gradient analysis (550, 1774, 2119 m  above sea level – a.s.l.) in the Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve, a remote high-altitude site on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. Continuous measurements (March–August 2024) revealed a marked positive gradient in O3 (14.8 ± 15.2 ppb at mountain foot to 40.2 ± 14.7 ppb at mountaintop), contrasting with declining precursor concentrations. Random Forest–SHAP analysis identified relative humidity and NOx as dominant controls at the mountain foot, whereas temperature and reactive VOCs governed O3 variability aloft. Chemical box modeling (OBM-MCM v3.3.1) demonstrated net O3 destruction at mountain foot (−1.93 ppb h−1) due to NO titration, shifting to net production at mountainside (0.35 ppb h−1) and mountaintop (0.29 ppb h−1). While O3 formation remained NOx-limited across all sites, sensitivity to anthropogenic hydrocarbons increased with altitude (RIR: −0.12 mountain foot to 0.51 mountaintop). Transport analysis indicated O3 accumulation at mountain foot via regional transport, contrasting with mountainside and mountaintop, which function as net source regions. These findings necessitate altitude-specific O3 control: prioritizing NOx reduction at lower elevations while coordinating NOx and VOC controls at higher altitudes. Expanding high-altitude monitoring, especially in under-monitored areas like Southwest China, is crucial for characterizing regional background pollution. Future studies require vertical monitoring with improved models to assess transboundary impacts and changing emissions."

Radiosondes are considered the gold standard for measuring these profiles, but the temporal resolution is frequently too coarse for many applications within the atmospheric boundary layer. This study proposes a new method using a normalized height grid in the temporal interpolation process that yields more accurate profiles in the convective boundary layer. 
 A significantly improved technique for temporally interpolating radiosonde (RS) profiles of potential temperature and water vapor mixing ratio in the planetary boundary layer during daytime is introduced. The key innovation of this technique is its operation on a height grid normalized with the planetary boundary layer height. This study utilized a three-month dataset of three-hourly soundings from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Facility's Southern Great Plains site. The technique was evaluated for convective boundary layer cases, with the necessary boundary layer height data obtained from a ground-based infrared spectrometer. A total of 79 comparisons were conducted between reference soundings and interpolated profiles that did and did not employ height normalization. The results demonstrated a substantial improvement in the representation of interpolated profiles using the new technique, characterized by enhanced correlation, improved amplitude representation, and reduced bias for potential temperature, as well as improved correlation and reduced bias for water vapor mixing ratio."

Brandt;Catherine Juéry;Vincent Blandin;Dominik Brunner;Gerrit Kuhlmann,Quantifying CH4 point source emissions with airborne remote sensing: first results from AVIRIS-4,"We tested a new airborne imaging instrument to detect and measure methane emissions. Flying over controlled test releases in France, we compared our measurements with known release rates. The instrument detected emissions as low as 5.5 kilograms per hour in good weather and 1.45 kilograms per hour in ideal conditions. Our results show that better wind information is crucial for accurate totals. Our new instrument is important for helping target methane leaks in energy and waste systems. 
 Atmospheric concentration of methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas, increased significantly since pre-industrial times, with anthropogenic emissions originating primarily from agriculture, fossil fuel sector and waste management. However, considerable uncertainties persist in the detection and quantification of anthropogenic CH4 emissions. In this study, we present first CH4 observations, plume detections and emission estimates from the new state-of-the-art Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer 4 (AVIRIS-4), which participated in a blind controlled release experiment in September 2024 in southern France. We used an albedo-corrected matched filter to retrieve CH4 maps from the spectral images and estimated CH4 emission with the Integrated Mass Enhancement (IME) and Cross-Sectional Flux (CSF) methods. Our results demonstrate that AVIRIS-4 can reliably detect emissions as low as 5.5 kg CH4 h−1 under good weather conditions at low flight altitudes (< 1500 m) and 1.45 kg CH4 h−1 under ideal conditions. These low-altitude detection limits are substantially lower than published detection limits for the predecessor instrument AVIRIS-NG, which were in the order of 10–16 kg CH4 h−1 under comparable conditions. While AVIRIS-4 provides highly accurate CH4 maps at < 0.5 m resolution, emission estimation is limited by the accuracy of the effective wind speed, whose uncertainty and natural variability contribute substantially to the overall uncertainty. Using wind speed at source height performs well for small releases (below 20 kg CH4 h−1) (rRMSE =1.065; rMBE =0.361) and overall (rRMSE =0.702; rMBE =−0.204). Using literature-derived effective wind speeds improves the apparent fit between estimated and reported CH4 emissions, but degrades performance both in overall agreement (rRMSE =2.098; rMBE =0.964) and for low-emission events (rRMSE =2.367; rMBE =1.711). Interestingly, the high spatial resolution makes it possible to retrieve the cast shadow of the CH4 plume, which can be used to estimate source and plume height, and could provide an approach for better constraining the height-dependency of the effective wind speed. On the bottom line, the controlled release experiment provides critical insights into the sensor's capabilities and guides further improvements to detect and quantify low intensity sources in the fossil fuel and waste management sectors, with implications for more accurate global greenhouse gas monitoring."

Traditional instruments only capture the average behavior of many particles, missing how individual ones grow. We developed a precise optical method that traps and measures single particles as humidity varies, accurately determining their dry size and water uptake. This versatile approach applies to diverse particle types and enhances understanding of their roles in air quality and climate systems. 
 Traditional hygroscopicity bulk measurements of aerosols using humidified tandem differential mobility analyzer (HTDMA) are limited to population-averaged properties, potentially overlooking individual particle growth processes. Although aerosol optical tweezers enable single-particle measurements, no universal and accurate method exists to determine particle dry radius and hygroscopic growth factor (GF). Here, we develop a robust method using optical tweezers to quantify GF of individual particles accurately. Solution densities were accurately predicted via apparent molar volume, and refractive indices were predicted using the molar refraction method. By fitting particle radius and refractive index across multiple relative humidities under the conservation of solute mass, we retrieve dry particle size and hygroscopic growth curves.

This study generates the first data-driven datasets (2000–2020) based on our renewed Coordinated estimates of land Surface Energy Balance model, providing all high-accuracy components with perfect energy balance. This advancement enhances the study of Earth’s surface energy dynamics, enables better water management, and improves renewable energy planning. 
 Accurately estimating global land surface radiation [including downward shortwave radiation (SWIN), downward longwave radiation (LWIN), upward shortwave radiation (SWOUT), upward longwave radiation (LWOUT) and net radiation (Rn)] and heat fluxes [including latent heat flux (LE), soil heat flux (G) and sensible heat flux (H)] is essential for quantifying the exchange of radiation, heat and water between the land and atmosphere under global climate change. This study presents the first data-driven energy-conservation datasets of global land surface radiation and heat fluxes from 2000 to 2020, generated by our model of Coordinated estimates of land Surface Energy Balance components (CoSEB). The model integrates GLASS and MODIS remote sensing data, ERA5-Land reanalysis datasets, topographic data, CO2 concentration data as independent variables and in situ radiation and heat flux observations at 258 eddy covariance sites worldwide as dependent variables within a multivariate random forest technique to effectively learn the physics of energy conservation. The developed CoSEB-based datasets are strikingly advantageous in that [1] they are the first data-driven global datasets that satisfy both surface radiation balance and heat balance among the eight fluxes, as demonstrated by both the radiation imbalance ratio [RIR, defined as 100%×(SWIN-SWOUT+LWIN-LWOUT-Rn)/Rn] and energy imbalance ratio [EIR, defined as 100%×(Rn-G-LE-H)/Rn] of 0, [2] the radiation and heat fluxes are characterized by high accuracies, where (1) the RMSEs (R2) for daily estimates of SWIN, SWOUT, LWIN, LWOUT, Rn, LE, H and G from the CoSEB-based datasets at 44 independent test sites were 37.52 W m−2 (0.81), 14.20 W m−2 (0.42), 22.47 W m−2 (0.90), 13.78 W m−2 (0.95), 29.66 W m−2 (0.77), 30.87 W m−2 (0.60), 29.75 W m−2 (0.44) and 5.69 W m−2 (0.44), respectively, (2) the CoSEB-based datasets, in comparison to the mainstream products/datasets (i.e. GLASS, BESS-Rad, BESSV2.0, FLUXCOM, MOD16A2, PML_V2 and ETMonitor) that generally separately estimated subsets of the eight flux components, better agreed with the in situ observations. Our developed datasets hold significant potential for application across diverse fields such as agriculture, forestry, hydrology, meteorology, ecology, and environmental science, which can facilitate comprehensive studies on the variability, impacts, responses, adaptation strategies, and mitigation measures of global and regional land surface radiation and heat fluxes under the influences of climate change and human activities.

However, PFOS degradation pathways and underlying mechanisms under smoldering reductive conditions remain unclear. In this study, PFOS smoldering degradation pathways and relative bond cleavage mechanisms were deduced from lab-scale byproduct profiles and supported by reactive force field simulations and quantum-chemical calculations. Smoldering self-sustained at calorific value of 0.79 MJ/kg and air Darcy velocity of 1.5–2.5 cm/s. The removal rate of PFOS reached 98.1%, with only ∼50% energy consumption compared with that of conventional incineration under equivalent degradation conditions. Investigations revealed distinct degradation pathways in smoldering compared with traditional approaches: in a CO atmosphere, early C–C bond scission and CO-coupled sulfur transformation were predicted (potentially evolving toward COS). This pathway played a dominant role in PFOS degradation, providing more efficient sulfur-group transformation, less toxic byproducts, and better compatibility with oxygen-limited conditions. Pilot-scale experiments further validated the feasibility for field applications, achieving 98.6% PFOS removal. These findings provide mechanistic insights into improved smoldering-based PFASs remediation under reductive conditions and optimization of treatment strategies toward higher efficiency and environmental safety."

Here, we demonstrate that aged polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) unexpectedly mitigate cadmium [Cd(II)]-induced acute cytotoxicity in osteoblasts, suggesting a modulatory role beyond passive transport. Aged PS-NPs effectively adsorb Cd(II) via electrostatic and coordination interactions, forming larger aggregates that significantly limit cellular uptake compared to free Cd(II). This mitigating effect was further associated with restricted Cd(II) release, altered subcellular trafficking, and limited mitochondrial penetration, as revealed by super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM). In addition, molecular-level analyses demonstrated that aged PS-NPs impaired Cd(II) binding to biomolecules. Collectively, these mechanisms reduced Cd(II) bioavailability. Quantitatively, aged PS-NPs reduced intracellular free Cd(II) by ∼14–29% and attenuated cytotoxic responses by ∼15–33% with respect to oxidative stress, membrane damage, and apoptosis during 24 h of acute co-exposure. Our findings reveal an unexpected mitigating role of aged nanoplastics in metal toxicity, challenging their conventional view as merely passive carriers. However, given the environmental persistence of both nanoplastics and Cd(II), their long-term co-exposure risks warrant urgent assessment."

The tropical sea surface temperature (SST) variability, fundamentally shaping the global weather patterns, may also alter malaria transmission and potentially improve its long‐lead predictability. In this study, we propose a machine learning‐based methodology that leverages comprehensive tropical SST variability for malaria prediction in the Peruvian Amazon. First, we demonstrate that significant correlations broadly exist between tropical SST anomalies and Peruvian malaria occurrence across different seasons and time lags, confirming the potential predictability from the tropical ocean. Then, we apply the self‐organizing map to synthesize the spatiotemporally varying SST‐malaria relationship and identify a unique dynamic SST index for Peruvian malaria. The dynamic SST index provides better performance (higher correlation coefficients and lower root mean square errors) in the generalized linear model, compared to the traditional El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index, with lead times exceeding 3 months. Furthermore, the dynamic SST index captures the evolution of the ENSO life cycle from its precursor climate mode (Pacific Meridional Mode) and appears to influence Peruvian malaria by altering the local near‐surface air temperature and specific humidity. Such underlying mechanisms provide the physically plausible basis for the long‐lead predictability of Peruvian malaria using a machine learning‐based remote predictor. Last but not least, we provide open‐source code for broad applications in linking tropical SST variability and vector‐borne disease transmission, or other climate‐sensitive socioeconomic issues."

 In this study, the variations in near-surface wind speed (SWS) across China were analysed using 55 years of observational data from 2044 meteorological stations spanning 1970–2024. The results indicate that the SWS in China experienced a persistent decline from 1970 to 2004, then remained constant from 2005 to 2014 and shifted to recovery after 2015. The seasonal and spatial analyses confirmed that the slowdown period occurred nearly nationwide, whereas the apparent recovery displayed a strong spatial heterogeneity. On the basis of long-term station records and metadata from China, station-by-station analysis revealed that SWS records are strongly influenced by widespread relocations; 1237 stations (60.5% of the total stations) with SWS discontinuities were related to relocations, leading to an overestimation of the so-called “recovery phase” at national and regional scales. This emphasized the importance of homogenization to ensure the reliability of the SWS dataset. Afterwards, the SWS breakpoints were detected and adjusted. After homogenization, the SWS displayed slight but significantly negative trends (–‍0.06 m s⁻¹ per decade) after 2005. Representative non-relocated stations were used to validate the homogenized results, and revealed that the homogenized series accurately captured more robust signal from non-relocated stations, which confirmed the consistent declining trends across China and further implied the effect of station relocation. Notably, compared with the original records, the reduction in the homogenized SWS ranged from 3% to 11% among the subregions. This could substantially impact on the assessment of wind energy resources and requires careful attention."

 Over the past four decades, global tropical cyclogenesis (TCG) frequency has exhibited no trend related to strong interannual variability and uneven regional TCG trends, despite pronounced global sea surface temperature (SST) increases. This study offers new evidence explaining the disparity between the global TCG trend and global warming. Here we show that just three global tropics-wide SST patterns can account for TCG interannual variability in most global ocean areas where TCG is climatologically active. We further find that the warming mode of tropical SSTs explains 77% of global ocean areas observed with significant TCG trends, with the strongest influence in the tropics with robust observed TCG trends. These warming-related TCG trends are associated with a reorganization of the Pacific and Atlantic Walker circulations, which modulates environmental conditions governing regional TCG. These findings reveal how global warming influences regional TCG in an uneven manner, consistent with the mechanisms underpinning interannual variability."

 Current–wind interaction modulates air–sea momentum and turbulent heat fluxes, which are critical in the energy cycle of tropical cyclones (TCs). However, the effects of the surface currents on air–sea exchange under TCs have remained unclear. Here, using an atmosphere–ocean coupled model, we investigate the role of current–wind interaction in determining TC intensity. Surface currents generally align with surface winds. Accounting for the current–wind interaction, the alignment reduces both the air–sea turbulent heat flux and momentum flux (average 1.0% and 2.5%), which serve as the energy source and sink of TCs, respectively. The reduction in the energy source (sink) decreases (increases) the TC growth −1.9% (+1.3%) on average and up to −13.7% (+11.1%). For simulations extending beyond the seasonal scale, the accumulated impacts of current–wind interaction alter TC genesis, affecting surface wind speed and sea surface temperature during the TC season. These findings reveal an important feedback mechanism associated with TCs driven by the current–wind interaction."

 Accurate and efficient climate simulations are crucial for understanding Earth’s evolving climate. However, current general circulation models (GCMs) face challenges in capturing unresolved physical processes, such as cloud and convection. A common solution is to adopt cloud-resolving models, which provide more accurate results than the standard subgrid parametrization schemes typically used in GCMs. However, cloud-resolving models, also referred to as super parametrizations, remain computationally prohibitive. Hybrid modeling, which integrates deep learning with equation-based GCMs, offers a promising alternative but often struggles with long-term stability and accuracy issues. In this work, we find that water vapor oversaturation during condensation is a key factor compromising the stability of hybrid models. To address this, we introduce CondensNet, a novel neural network architecture that embeds a self-adaptive physical constraint to correct unphysical condensation processes. CondensNet effectively mitigates water vapor oversaturation, enhancing simulation stability while maintaining accuracy and improving computational efficiency compared to super-parametrization schemes. We integrate CondensNet into a GCM to form PCNN-GCM (Physics-Constrained Neural Network GCM), a hybrid deep learning framework designed for long-term stable climate simulations in real-world conditions, including ocean and land. PCNN-GCM represents a significant milestone in hybrid climate modeling, as it shows a novel way to incorporate physical constraints adaptively, paving the way for accurate, lightweight, and stable long-term climate simulations."

 Extreme precipitation (EP) is a major climate risk, yet its projections remain uncertain due to the combined influence of thermodynamic (TH) and dynamic (DY) processes. Using multi-model simulations under three emission scenarios, we separate TH and DY contributions to the annual maximum 1-day precipitation (Rx1Day) and quantify their uncertainties. TH consistently intensifies extremes with warming, while DY strongly modulates their magnitude and direction. DY processes dominate Rx1Day uncertainty, with internal variability within DY emerging as the leading contributor. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) analysis shows that the forced signal emerges more clearly for TH than DY, where chaotic variability fundamentally limits predictability. The strongest intensification occurs in equatorial regions, raising equity concerns for vulnerable populations. These results demonstrate that DY internal variability is the primary driver of EP uncertainty, highlighting limits to long-term predictability and the importance of properly representing natural dynamical fluctuations in future projections."

 Aerosol semi-direct effects represent one of the least understood yet important pathways of aerosol interactions. These effects occur when absorbing aerosols rapidly adjust Earth’s radiative budget through modifications of thermodynamic structures that influence cloud cover. Over the Atlantic Ocean, where two primary radiation-absorbing aerosols (smoke and dust) dominate above clouds, the mechanisms by which aerosol-layer properties affect underlying low-level cloud-top radiative cooling—a critical parameter controlling cloudiness—remain unclear. Using ten years of satellite-derived aerosol, cloud, and radiative flux observations, combined with radiative-transfer simulations, we find that dust and smoke layers induce longwave-dominated warming responses that weaken the mean radiative cooling at low-level cloud tops. However, the pathways of this warming response differ, resulting in dust layers impacting cloud-top cooling about ten times more than smoke layers. Whereas dust properties dominate dust-induced warming responses through direct interactions in longwave, smoke-induced warming responses involve enhanced smoke-layer moisture that induces longwave radiation, opposing the impacts of smoke properties at cloud tops. This weakened cloud-top cooling response reduces low-level cloudiness by approximately 1.21% and 0.28% for dust and smoke, respectively. Our findings demonstrate the importance of accounting for longwave-mediated processes beyond traditional shortwave-dominated mechanisms in estimates of aerosol semi-direct effects.

 Ocean oxygen minimum zones have expanded since the mid-20th century, yet their future remains uncertain. Previous studies show that the eastern tropical North Pacific was well oxygenated during the warm Miocene Climatic Optimum (17.0–14.8 Ma), suggesting better oxygenation under climatic warming. To explore whether this response was global, we reconstruct Miocene oxygenation in the second largest oxygen minimum zone, the Arabian Sea. Trace elements and nitrogen isotopes in planktonic foraminifera show that the Arabian Sea was also better oxygenated during the Miocene Climatic Optimum than today. However, deoxygenation history and establishment of a true oxygen deficient zone following the Miocene cooling lagged in the Arabian Sea, indicating the important role of regional oceanographic processes like proto-monsoon or Tethys outflow. Our study supports future projections of deoxygenation reversals in both oxygen minimum zones, but with more complexity in the Arabian Sea due to competing changes in monsoonal upwelling and influx from marginal seas.

 Snow depth estimation using Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) has emerged as a critical tool for monitoring global water environment dynamics. However, traditional linear GNSS-R snow depth estimation methods are often constrained by residual nonlinear errors induced by environmental factors and complex multipath effects. While recent studies have explored machine learning (ML) techniques like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF), their direct snow depth retrieval approaches are still susceptible to residual nonlinear errors during snow-free periods. To address these limitations, we proposes the Dual-Branch ML framework with decoupled architectures for nonlinear interference mitigation in GNSS-R-derived snow depth estimation. The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), SVM, RF are employed for efficient snow state detection, and the 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), RF then leverage the extracted features (frequency, amplitude, phase, and previous day’s snow depth) to perform the precise regression task for snow depth estimation, respectively.

 Carbon satellites, as an essential means of obtaining atmospheric XCO2 concentration, play a key role in monitoring the global carbon cycle. However, the differences in observation platforms, resolutions, and inversion algorithms among different satellites lead to apparent inconsistencies among multi-source XCO2 data, which limits the joint application and comprehensive analysis of the data. In this paper, we develop a framework named MCF-XCO2 (Multi-source Consistency Fusion of XCO2) for correcting multi-source satellite XCO2 observations and performing uncertainty-weighted fusion. The method leverages high-precision satellite products as references, while minimizing the need for direct ground-based correction, to enhance the consistency and overall accuracy of multi-source observations. Based on this framework, multi-source satellite data, including GOSAT, GOSAT-2, OCO-2, and OCO-3, were integrated to construct a sparsely gridded global XCO2 fusion dataset at 0.01° × 0.02° nominal spatial resolution and nominal daily sampling, reflecting available observations. The findings indicate that the fused dataset shows improved coverage in grids with available observations compared to individual satellite products, improved accuracy, and better consistency over time. Independent validation against TCCON ground-based observations further confirms the method's effectiveness, with R2 = 0.91, RMSE = 1.09 ppm, bias = 0.07 ppm, and MRE = 0.2 %.

Trigo;Raquel Nieto;Luis Gimeno,Unravelling the drivers of the April–May 2024 extreme precipitation event in Rio Grande do Sul,"•A quasi-stationary blocking high and deep low drove this extreme event •The event was amplified by concurrent heat wave conditions to the north •An atmospheric river-like pattern sustained the anomalous moisture supply •This extreme precipitation event was a high-impact compound event •The event was less predictable and persistent than similar past events. 
 This study examines the extreme precipitation event that caused unprecedented flooding in Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil, during April–May 2024, leading to record-breaking floods in Porto Alegre. Using data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA5, the high-resolution Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation dataset, a Lagrangian moisture tracking approach, and an analogue-based analysis, we identified the atmospheric drivers and moisture sources fueling this event. Results show that a persistent, quasi-stationary dipole configuration, consisting of a high over the South Atlantic and a deep low over southern South America, drove this extreme event. This configuration, reinforced by heat wave conditions over central and southeastern Brazil, favoured a sustained, atmospheric river-like moisture transport from the Amazon region, channelled by a strengthened South American Low-Level Jet east of the Andes, configuring a compound event. We also found that the highest moisture contribution occurred predominantly 1–3 days before the precipitation over RS. The analogue-based analysis revealed that while the mean sea level pressure (MSLP) pattern was uncommon but not unique within the 1991–2020 reference period, the RS extreme event exhibited significantly enhanced moisture transport and uptake from the Amazon region compared to similar past occurrences. Additionally, we found lower predictability and persistence of the MSLP pattern during this event than that of its analogues. Overall, this research underscores the critical role of specific large-scale atmospheric patterns and sustained anomalous moisture supply in driving extreme precipitation, reinforcing the need for an improved understanding of climate-weather interactions and the development of mitigation strategies to address intensifying extreme precipitation events in a changing climate."

Of particular interest are developing easy-to-implement yet effective approaches for controlling the radiation dynamics and directionality of spin-forbidden dark excitons (XD) in two-dimensional semiconductors. Here, we investigate the spectral, temporal, and directional characteristics of room-temperature XDemission from a tungsten diselenide monolayer coupled to a dissipative plasmonic nanocavity. Under resonant plasmon-exciton coupling, the radiative decay rate of XDis accelerated by nearly four orders of magnitude, and correspondingly, the XDlifetime is shortened to a subnanosecond level, making it comparable to that of bright excitons. Fitting the measured lifetimes with a Purcell-formalism–based cavity quantum electrodynamics model allows estimating of the intrinsic room-temperature XDlifetime to be about 24 ± 2.3 microseconds. Furthermore, the measured radiation patterns of the dark excitons show that subtle variations in the nanocavity orientation can effectively tailor the XDemission directionality, important for quantum technologies and optoelectronics applications."

However, distinguishing between these sources for reactive chlorine remains challenging. Here, we establish isotopic constraints on the origin of tropospheric reactive chlorine using chemical ionization mass spectrometry to analyze nitryl chloride (ClNO2). Field observations from four regions in China reveal a much broader isotopic value (δ37Cl) range for ClNO2(−21 to +39‰) than previously documented for Earth’s chlorine reservoirs. Notably, significant δ37Cl differences for ClNO2from sea-salt emissions (−9 ± 4‰) and anthropogenic combustion sources (+20 ± 7‰) were identified. These distinct isotopic signatures, combined with field data, highlight the important role of oceanic chlorine in air pollution, with its chemical cycling affecting not only coastal regions but also extending into inland areas.

Across 578,000 kilometers of river length, 18% of the total length experienced a significant increase inCPOC, which exceeds the 11% that exhibited declines, resulting in a net rise. Most increases occurred after 2005, contributing to a 12.6% (0.49 teragrams per year) increase in totalFPOCto the Arctic Ocean between 1985 to 2005 and 2006 to 2022. Regional contrasts highlight distinct possible drivers: increased precipitation in the North American Arctic and atmospheric warming in the Eurasian Arctic. Deepening of the permafrost active layer is also significantly correlated withCPOCincreases.

However, potential biases in spatial distribution, magnitude, and trends in ozone simulated by global chemistry-climate models limit their applicability in regional evaluations. In this study, LightGBM, a machine learning (ML) algorithm, is applied to correct biases in CESM2-simulated ozone over China, the United States, and Europe and to calibrate future projections under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1–2.6 and SSP5–8.5) from 2020 to 2060. The ML-based correction significantly improves spatial distribution and reduces bias by 40 to 60%, also reversing the potentially incorrect trend under SSP1–2.6 in eastern China. When the ML-based correction is applied to CESM2 projections, the warm-season mean ozone shows substantial changes from 2020 to 2060. Under SSP1–2.6, corrected ozone decreases by 13.5, 17.9, and 13.7 μg/m3 in China, the United States, and Europe, respectively. In contrast, under SSP5–8.5, ozone increases over the same period by 9.4, 2.0, and 5.2 μg/m3 in these regions. The decomposition analysis shows that anthropogenic emission changes dominate future ozone trends, while a strong climate penalty occurs in polluted eastern China and climate benefits are found in western China, the United States, and Europe under SSP5–8.5. These findings demonstrate the value of combining ML with chemistry-climate models to produce more accurate air quality projections, indicating more effective and region-specific environmental protection strategies."

Research suggests that CH4 emissions from most North American cities have large contributions from natural gas distribution and end use. In this work, we examine trace gas measurements from a central air monitoring station in Calgary, Alberta, Canada to attribute the city’s CH4 emissions to major source categories. Using positive matrix factorization (PMF), we identified four primary CH4 emissions source categories: natural gas─fugitives, natural gas─incomplete combustion, waste/biogenic, and petroleum product processing. Results from PMF modeling indicate that the bulk of CH4 emissions in Calgary are from natural gas fugitives and incomplete combustion (81% ± 35%). This is much higher than the proportion derived from available bottom-up emissions inventories. The CH4 emissions from natural gas sources increase in winter and may be related to increased natural gas use for space heating. Emissions from waste/biogenic sources were the next largest contributor, which doubled in warmer months, consistent with temperature-driven microbial activity. Though relatively small, CH4 emissions from petroleum product processing are non-negligible and consistent. Overall, these findings underscore the need for targeted mitigation strategies focused on the natural gas supply chain, while also highlighting the influence of seasonal dynamics on urban CH4 emissions."

This study implements a new turbulent orographic form drag (TOFD) parameterization scheme using 30‐m‐resolution terrain data in the WRF‐Chem model. Over a 1‐month simulation, this scheme reduced the overestimated surface wind speed by 45%. Compared with observations from 41 meteorological stations and one radio‐sounding station in the Taklimakan Desert, it also decreased the root mean square errors for surface and near‐surface winds by about 20% and 5%, respectively.

Using multisource cloud, aerosol, and meteorology data during summer of 2015–2024, this study investigates ACI from the perspective of aerosol size (denoted by Ångström exponent, AE) over the ocean and land in eastern China. Our findings reveal that at a fixed cloud water path, the cloud droplet effective radius (CER) increases with the aerosol index (AI) under high‐AE conditions (fine‐mode aerosols), while CER decreases with increasing AI when AE is below 1.4 (coarse‐mode aerosols) in both regions. We interpret the opposite correlations as arising from aerosol size‐dependent regulation of cloud‐nucleating ability, which leads to distinct dominant cloud microphysical processes. Over land, smaller aerosols with lower cloud‐nucleating ability lead to weaker competition for water vapor and the collision‐coalescence process becomes dominant due to the enhanced turbulence as aerosols increase. Conversely, activation efficiency is significantly stronger for coarse‐mode aerosols over the ocean and the competition effect becomes the dominant process. In addition, the dominant aerosol size decreases as cloud top pressure increases over land, leading to a transition in the CER‐AI relationships from negative to positive. The link between lower cloud tops and finer aerosols is consistent with the enhanced radiative stabilization induced by a higher proportion of fine aerosols (often light‐absorbing). In contrast, AE values over the ocean remain consistently low, resulting in persistent negative correlations. Despite variations in meteorological conditions, the opposite correlations under dominant coarse‐ and fine‐mode aerosol conditions still exist."

Simulations in winter of the North China Plain (NCP) reveal that non‐ideal treatment enhances condensation of organics species and water vapor, amplifies interactions between OA, aerosol liquid water content (ALWC), and secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA, pSO42−, pNO3− and pNH4+).

The vertical structures closely match theoretical expectations for most modes. Notably, the geopotential height amplitudes of the Pekeris modes are comparable to or greater than those of the Lamb modes in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere, suggesting an important role for Pekeris modes in the dynamics of this region.

 Fire is a pervasive biogeographic process that shapes biodiversity globally and is now experiencing unprecedented changes. Despite well documented impacts of fires on biodiversity, we do not know where biodiversity might be most vulnerable to changing fire regimes. We leverage recent advancements in fire forecasting and species distribution modeling to assess the exposure of bird species richness, community uniqueness, and functional richness to altered fire regimes in the western United States. We find that 55-58% of biodiversity hotspots are classified as “refugia”, where high biodiversity intersects with predicted low severity burn areas. In contrast, 24-30% of biodiversity hotspots are classified as “areas of concern”, where high biodiversity intersected with predicted high severity burn areas. Over half (52-60%) of “areas of concern” occur in geographies with historically low-severity fire regimes; a fire regime mismatch indicating a potential threat to biodiversity. We find that species with a preference for high-density vegetation and with shallower beak depth are most likely to be exposed to high severity fire, indicating a potential for habitat losses for species with these traits. Our findings reinforce calls for targeted management to reduce impacts of future fire where it is predicted to be outside the historical range of variation.

Here we investigate Heinrich Stadial signals across the West Mediterranean, West Africa and West-Central Africa by integrating pollen-based quantitative precipitation reconstructions, paleohydrological records and HadCM3B climate simulations. Results reveal pronounced aridity in the West Mediterranean, driven by reduced evaporation and weakened westerlies. West Africa also experienced aridity, primarily linked to intensified wind systems, including the northeast trade winds and African easterly jet. Notably, Heinrich Stadial 3 is absent in this region. By contrast, Heinrich Stadials are undetected in West-Central Africa, likely due to its transitional position between arid northern and humid southern air masses, positive evaporation-precipitation anomalies, and the influence of southeast trade winds that sustained humidity. These findings highlight strong regional contrasts in the Heinrich Stadial impacts over the last 70 kyr.

 Recent advances in deep learning and multimodal data fusion technologies have significantly enhanced hyperspectral image (HSI) classification performance. Nevertheless, classification accuracy of hyperspectral data continues to degrade substantially under diverse degradation scenarios, such as noise interference, spectral distortion, or reduced resolution. To robustly address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel cross-modal guided classification framework that integrates active remote sensing data (e.g., LiDAR) to improve classification resilience under degraded conditions. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Modal Feature Pyramid Guidance (CMFPG) module, which effectively utilizes cross-modal information across multiple levels and scales to guide hyperspectral feature extraction and fusion, thereby enhancing modeling stability in degraded environments. Additionally, we develop the HyperGroupMix module, which enhances cross-domain adaptability through grouping spectral bands, extracting statistical features, and transferring features across samples. Experimental results conducted under complex degradation conditions demonstrate that our proposed method exhibits stable high-level classification accuracy and robustness in overall performance.

 Atmospheric inverse modelling for source estimation typically relies on hourly-averaged concentration measurements, overlooking valuable extra information contained in real-world high-frequency data, largely due to the absence of suitable modelling frameworks. We present a novel inverse modelling approach that leverages this information by representing the full concentration probability distribution function (PDF) through concentration percentiles derived from a left-shifted clipped-gamma parameterisation, requiring only the mean and variance of concentration, with intermittency parameterised empirically. Mean and variance are modelled using Lagrangian and Eulerian approaches, respectively, within a backward dispersion framework to efficiently compute percentiles for integration within a Bayesian inversion. Applied to a controlled methane release field experiment at a geological carbon capture and storage site, higher-order percentiles improve emission rate estimates and reduce source location uncertainty compared to mean-based inversions, though location accuracy declines slightly; lower-order percentiles worsen performance, likely due to background methane variability. Percentiles inherently encapsulate mean concentration, so combining both offers no added benefit. The primary limitation lies in variance prediction, which is more uncertain and sensitive to turbulence than mean modelling. Exploiting high-frequency data beyond mean values, the proposed percentile-based inverse modelling (PBIM) approach offers a practical path to improved source estimation, warranting further validation with longer-term, spatially extensive datasets or tracer releases with minimal background interference."

 Aerosols influence the climate system, human health, and the surfaces of machines. The ingestion of aerosols into aircraft engines leads to fouling, erosion, and performance deterioration. This study evaluates data sources used for engine deterioration modeling. For this purpose, a comparison of atmospheric composition reanalysis data with in-situ measurements of a commonly modeled and frequently occurring aerosol species, namely hydrophobic black carbon, is presented. High-resolution observations are obtained from a field campaign performed with the uncrewed aerial system ALADINA (Application of Light-weight Aircraft for Detecting IN-situ Aerosol), near the German airport Berlin-Brandenburg in October 2021. A total of 140 vertical profiles of hydrophobic black carbon and meteorological parameters are compared with mass mixing ratios extracted from two different atmospheric composition reanalysis datasets, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast Atmospheric Composition Reanalysis 4 (EAC4) and the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2). The differences between model outputs and atmospheric measurements are large. 95% of the deviations between measurements and model outputs lie under 8480% in the case of EAC4 data and under 2302% in the case of MERRA-2 data, indicating that the MERRA-2 data better represents the local conditions at the Berlin-Brandenburg airport. The deviations are mainly affected by the stability of the planetary boundary layer, showing the highest discrepancies during well-mixed conditions.

 This study investigated the transport pathways and sectoral potential source areas of PM2.5 in Tangshan in January, April, July, and October of 2020. Utilizing the HYSPLIT model upon MeteoInfo software, cluster analysis was conducted on the backward trajectories of airflow at different starting heights and times. The sectoral potential source areas of PM2.5 in Tangshan were determined by calculating the weighted potential source contribution function (WPSCF) and weighted concentration-weighted trajectory (WCWT) while examining pollution transport pathways. The findings are as follows: Firstly, the higher PM2.5 concentration carried by pollution trajectories in January (114.8 μg m−3) and October (110.7 μg m−3) is mainly due to the impact of short-distance transport through Hebei and Tianjin, trajectory 1 (950 hPa) accounts for 30.52 % (124.8 μg m−3) of the contaminated airflow. Secondly, the potential source area for PM2.5 pollution in Tangshan during January has the highest value of WPSCF and WCWT. WCWT high-value areas exceeding 90 μg m−3 were distributed in the Langfang, parts of Tianjin, Beijing, and the junction of the Hebei Beijing Tianjin. Thirdly, the contribution of various sector sources to Tangshan's PM2.5 concentration varies across different months, with industrial and residential sources being the primary contributors. Fourthly, the airflow trajectories at 500 m and 1000 m heights were consistent. 24-h PM2.5 was more concentrated, and the potential source area (24/72-h) results indicated the high-value areas were industrially dense areas. These findings underscore the importance of regional collaborative efforts and sector collaborative management to mitigate PM2.5 pollution in Tangshan."

 The emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) worsen air quality and pose potential health and environmental risks. The steel industry is an important NMVOCs source category, yet studies on NMVOCs emissions in steel industry remains limited, particularly for stainless steel manufacturing. This study presents a field investigation of NMVOCs emissions for different processes in both stainless steel and carbon steel plants, revealing clear differences in emission characteristics between them. The results show that the NMVOCs emissions were higher in stainless steel production, with notable different species profiles compared to carbon steel plant. The emission of carbon disulfide during the sintering process in stainless steel manufacturing was lower compared to carbon steel production. These discrepancies were attributed to the different raw materials used for production of the two types of steel, and higher fuel consumption and lower combustion efficiency for stainless steel production. The NMVOCs emission factor for stainless steel sintering was 40 times higher than that of carbon steel sintering, thus the NMVOCs emissions from steel production could be underestimated without consideration of this high emission factor. In addition, this study examined the impact of air pollution control devices (APCDs) on NMVOCs emissions for steel production. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and flue gas desulfurization (FGD) technologies demonstrated great NMVOCs removal efficiency, while fabric filter (FF) might elevate NMVOCs emissions. The diverse effects resulted primarily from the removal mechanisms of these APCDs and the physicochemical properties of NMVOCs. Through field measurements, this study improves the understanding of NMVOCs emission characteristics in the steel manufacturing industry and provides valuable insights for development of NMVOCs emission control strategies."

 The Mongolian Plateau (MP), a typical arid and semi-arid region, hosts fragile ecosystems that are highly sensitive to variations in precipitation. Within a summer season, precipitation in the MP exhibits significant 10–30-day variability, accounting for ∼40% of the total precipitation variability. This study investigates the characteristics of quasi-biweekly precipitation in the MP and evaluates its representation in 20 CMIP6 climate models. Surprisingly, all models underestimate the intensity of the quasi-biweekly precipitation (only 35–80%). Further analysis shows that this deficiency mainly results from the insufficiency of dynamic conditions associated with ascending motion rather than the thermodynamic conditions related to moisture. Diagnosis of the scale-decomposed moisture budget equation reveals that the anomalous water vapor in the MP mostly comes from horizontal moisture advection, in which both anomalous southeasterlies transporting the background moisture and background westerlies transporting the moisture perturbations into the MP play positive roles. CMIP6 models reasonably capture these moisture processes, but they poorly simulate the mid-latitude wave-train system that is critical for generating ascending motion. The pronounced positive vorticity advection observed on the lee-side of the Altai Mountains is not captured in the CMIP6 simulations. Consequently, compared to the ascending motion appearing over the entire MP in the observations, the simulated upward motion is only present in the eastern plateau. The negative biases of the circulation anomalies greatly suppress the quasi-biweekly rainfall intensity, highlighting dynamical deficiencies in current climate models."

 Clouds are a critical component of the Earth–atmosphere system, exerting strong influence on climate change and the global water cycle. Temperature is a fundamental parameter governing cloud development and evolution, and its vertical gradient directly shapes the vertical structure of clouds, thereby modulating key cloud physical processes. However, cloud temperature observations remain limited, and previous studies have primarily focused on single-layer clouds (SLC) or a single inversion layer. In this study, ten years of radiosonde data (2014–2023) in Xi’an were used to investigate the occurrence frequency and vertical temperature structure of SLC, double-layer clouds (DLC), and multi-layer clouds (MLC). The results show that the occurrence frequency of SLC tends to decrease over time, while the frequency of DLC and MLC increases year by year in Xi’an. Cloud top heights (CTH) exhibit significant seasonal variations. In SLC, temperature inversions (TI) occur more frequently in the upper cloud during winter and spring and are generally stronger at cloud tops than at cloud bases, with the probability of strong cloud-top TI exceeding that at the cloud base by more than a factor of two. While SLC is dominated by single-layer radiative cooling, TI in DLC and MLC exhibits complex interlayer radiative coupling mechanisms. In DLC and MLC, upper clouds tend to show shallow inversion depths under strong TI, whereas weak TI is associated with deeper inversions. Lower clouds, in contrast, exhibit nearly twice the probability of strong cloud-top TI compared with upper clouds. This pronounced enhancement suggests that radiative forcing from upper clouds plays a key intermediary role in strengthening TI in lower clouds. When temperature gradients are small, however, this enhancement is reduced and inversion development in lower clouds may be suppressed. Overall, these findings clarify the vertical coupling between cloud layers and TI, providing refined insights and valuable observational evidence for future studies on cloud–radiation interactions and cloud physical processes."

Although marine microorganisms mediate OC degradation during macroalgal decay, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined. This study employed an integrated multiomics approach (amplicon sequencing, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics) to investigate microbial regulation of OC degradation and coupled nutrient cycling in coastal sediments with and without decomposing Sargassaceae. Total carbon in sediments increased by over 33% in the Sargassaceae area. Microbial α-diversity in the Sargassaceae area decreased significantly (p < 0.05), while processes linked to OC degradation, carbohydrate metabolism, nitrate (NO3–) reduction, inorganic phosphorus utilization, and sulfur metabolism were significantly upregulated (p < 0.05). Accordingly, gene expression and extracellular hydrolase activities targeting key biopolymers (i.e., cellulose, hemicellulose, starch, and chitin) were significantly upregulated (p < 0.05) in the area with Sargassaceae. Metabolism reconstruction of metagenome-assembled genomes identified Vibrio, Pseudoalteromonas, Alteromonas, and Exiguobacterium_A as primary OC degraders, with genomic capacities enriched in NO3– reduction and assimilatory sulfate reduction. Key environmental drivers─including the C/N ratio, dissolved organic carbon, total dissolved nitrogen (DON), and NO3–─shaped microbial metabolic activities during macroalgal decomposition. Our finding demonstrates that microbially driven OC degradation is a pivotal process coupled with nutrients cycling, advancing the mechanistic understanding of microbial carbon processing and its biogeochemical linkages during macroalgal decomposition in coastal ecosystems."

In a cross‐latitude survey conducted in the northwestern Pacific Ocean (155°E, 28.5°N–41.5°N), bulk DOC concentrations were found to be relatively constant below 1,000 m with little variation across latitude. Despite this stability, compound‐specific analyses revealed unexpectedly high abundance of hydrolyzable amino acids, up to 1.1% of DOC, at depths of 1,000–4,000 m between 30°N and 36°N. This amino acid enrichment, doubling the typical levels observed in other deep‐sea basins and comparable to upper ocean values, reflected episodic inputs of semi‐labile DOC likely derived from actively settling fresh particles.

Our results indicate persistently stronger deoxygenation in the northern Arabian Sea throughout the last glacial cycle. The OMZ expanded southward during the Last Glacial Maximum—likely driven by reduced ventilation and increased productivity from enhanced winter mixing of nutrients. During deglaciation, it retreated northward as southern‐sourced intermediate waters intruded and productivity declined. We suggest that changes in ventilation and productivity, rather than water temperature, exerted the dominant control on Arabian Sea OMZ variability."

In the rapidly warming Arctic Ocean (AO), however, the contemporary distribution patterns and decadal variability of aerosol TE deposition remain poorly constrained, representing a critical gap in our understanding of current and future Arctic environmental changes. Here, we present extensive shipboard observations of 13 aerosol TEs across the AO during summer 2024. TE concentrations and the enrichment levels of these anthropogenic TEs rank among the lowest globally observed in the AO. The comparable or even elevated mineral‐ dominated TE concentrations and deposition fluxes (Al, Fe) in the Central AO than Peripheral AO challenge current dust models, potential influenced by sea ice/snow resuspension. Coal combustion (As, Se), non‐exhaust vehicular emissions (Ni, Cr), and metallurgical activities (Zn) emerged as primary anthropogenic sources, with detectable anthropogenic imprint even in mineral‐dominated TEs (e.g., Fe, Mn). Decadal comparisons with historical records revealed a near ten‐fold reduction in Pb and Cd enrichment, contrasting with a near‐doubling of V enrichment driven by intensified Arctic shipping. Moreover, the distinct aerosol Fe/Al fractionation between this study and historical observations likely arises from mixing inputs of anthropogenic Fe‐rich particles and permafrost‐derived Fe‐depleted weathering products, which amplify uncertainties in Fe flux estimations derived from dust proxy approaches. This study provides advance understanding of aerosol TE dynamics in the warming Arctic and provide critical constraints for polar biogeochemical cycles."

Here, we analyzed state‐of‐the‐art ocean and atmospheric reanalyses and observational data sets to investigate the variability of the winter sink and its relation with synoptic atmospheric features crossing the region in the period 1999–2020. High CO2 sink events are identified using classical extreme event approach with fixed threshold (95p) based on the CO2 daily flux distribution. First, we showed that these events are driven by large‐scale atmospheric configurations that produce stronger‐than‐average wind speed and colder‐than‐average 2 m and sea surface temperature patterns in the region. Second, a co‐location analysis was applied to assess the probability to detect an extra‐tropical cyclone at a fixed distance from the location of the events showing that the larger the event's magnitude, the higher the probability. In most of the cases, these cyclones originate within the Mediterranean region and are usually deeper, bigger in terms of size and characterized by a stronger circulation with respect to the systems that usually cross the region. By establishing a statistical relationship between high CO2 sink events and synoptic atmospheric activity, we emphasize the potential influence of the cyclone activity on the carbon budget of the Mediterranean Sea."

By changing the vegetation cover, these projects can potentially impact cloud formation through changes in energy and water partitioning between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere. In West Africa, satellite observations have shown an increase in cloud formation over restored areas. However, even though the spatial arrangement of restored areas differs between regreening approaches, such as farmer‐managed natural regeneration, area protection or reforestation, it is unknown how the spatial pattern of restoration projects impacts cloud formation. In this study, we use the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) mesoscale atmospheric model to determine how land restoration affects cloud formation for a case study at the border of the transnational W‐Arly‐Pendjari national park complex, with a sharp boundary between forest and grassland. First, we carry out a sensitivity analysis to determine the underlying mechanisms of cloud formation over forest regions, after which we run 27 land restoration scenarios with low (21%), intermediate (43%), and high (85%) forest cover and varying spatial clustering to assess the impact of land restoration patterns on cloud formation. The results highlight that an intermediate forest cover with higher clustering increases cloud formation due to stronger mesoscale circulation. A small scale heterogeneity in forest cover or a high forest cover, on the other hand, inhibits cloud formation. Because clouds play an important role in the Earth's water and energy balance, these results provide important insight into how projects can be designed to increase their climate benefits."

However, the spatiotemporal variations in ALWC and aerosol pH, along with their impacts on SIA formation, remain poorly understood. Based on a‐year‐long field observations of aerosol chemical components, ALWC and aerosol pH for Lanzhou and Beijing were calculated using ISORROPIA II. Aerosol liquid water content in Lanzhou was highest in winter and lowest in summer (17.2 vs. 3.30 μg m−3), opposite to that of Beijing (10.6 vs. 22.9 μg m−3). Aerosol pH in both cities was highest in winter and lowest in summer (4.68 vs. 2.96 in Lanzhou, 5.34 vs. 2.88 in Beijing). Machine learning identified TNH3 (NH4+ + NH3), SO42−, NO3−, relative humidity (RH), and temperature as crucial factors influencing ALWC and aerosol pH in both cities, while Mg2+ and Cl− were unique factors influencing pH in Lanzhou during summer and winter, respectively. During pollution periods, the effect of ALWC on enhancing heterogeneous and aqueous‐phase reactions for SIA formation was more pronounced in Beijing than in Lanzhou, as elevated ALWC levels provided more reaction medium and facilitated solid‐to‐liquid phase transitions. Additionally, elevated pH notably enhanced aqueous‐phase sulfate production via the O3 oxidation pathway in winter in both cities and via the H2O2 oxidation pathway in summer in Beijing. This study highlights the heterogeneity of ALWC and pH, along with their distinct impacts on SIA formation, which should be considered in atmospheric models to improve predictions of secondary aerosol formation and better assess the associated environmental and climatic effects."

Under the 2021 summer conditions, the average particle number size distribution follows a lognormal pattern, peaking at ∼70 nm. Refractory black carbon (rBC) aerosols constitute 17.7% of the total particle population in the 100–750 nm mobility diameter (Dmob) range, with their proportion rising to over 50% for Dmob > 500 nm. Most rBC particles are externally mixed, while only 12.2% are thickly coated with non‐refractory materials. Externally mixed rBC particles show strong non‐sphericity, with a dynamic shape factor increasing from 1.8 at 115 nm to 2.8 at 750 nm, consistent with aggregate structures. In contrast, thickly coated rBC particles are nearly spherical, with coating thickness increasing with size. The total rBC mass estimated from size‐resolved measurements closely matches bulk rBC mass directly measured. rBC‐free particles exhibit slight non‐sphericity, with shape factor positively correlated with refractive index, likely due to dust contributions. Bulk scattering coefficients derived from size‐resolved data match those estimated under the well‐mixed spherical assumption. However, the later scheme—lacking observational constraints on morphology and mixing state—overestimates absorption by over a factor of three, thereby underestimating the single‐scattering albedo. These results provide key constraints for improving aerosol radiative forcing estimates and advancing understanding of aerosol–climate interactions over the TP."

We employed a multipath ALWC calculation framework for a comprehensive closure study of ALWC and quantified the contribution of organic matter to ALWC. Results showed average ALWC during the observation period was 8.8 μg m−3 nearly equivalent to the dry aerosol mass. Unexpectedly, organics—accounting for over 70% of the total mass concentration of PM2.5—contributed an average of 42% ± 15% to ALWC, representing the highest contribution reported to date in similar studies. This demonstrated that neglecting the organic compounds significantly underestimate ALWC, as was further revealed consequently reducing aerosol extinction capacity by approximately 17.2%.

Our study highlights the significant role of organics in regulating aerosols liquid water content urging their inclusion in air quality and climate simulation models with the implementation of carbon reduction strategies."

 Gantry-equipped facilities are used in a wide range of research fields, for instance geomorphology.

Our objective is to develop high-performance data processing methods for our 20 by 3 m laboratory facility that is used for physical scale experiments on coastal morphology. We compare new and existing methods through quantification of spatial and relative errors in DEMs. Our new data processing methods incorporate SfM photogrammetry and computer graphics using a “base model” of our facility under idealized conditions. With this base model, we are able to successfully align all sensor outputs, creating large and geometrically consistent timeseries of orthomosaics and DEMs. Furthermore, the base model geometry provides for a gridded laserscan processing method, incorporating fixed extrinsic, intrinsic and distortion parameters of the sensors along the gantry. Compared to SfM photogrammetrically constructed DEMs, this new method shows greatly improved relative accuracy (0.74 mm compared to 0.97–4.18 mm) and spatial accuracy (2.13 mm compared to 2.39–8.25 mm). Moreover, we show that variations of extrinsic parameters of laserscan equipment along the gantry survey are significant, while these parameters are often assumed to be constant.

In this model, an edge-aware module is designed to enhance building boundary representation through multi-scale Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filtering. Additionally, a local aggregation strategy is integrated into Mamba’s global scanning mechanism, which enables the network to effectively capture global and local context. Building height data from Wuhan and the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region in China is selected to evaluate EL-Mamba’s performance. The results indicate that compared to the four existing methods, EL-Mamba achieves the lowest root mean square error (RMSE), with values of 4.963 and 5.358 on the Wuhan and YRD datasets, respectively. Furthermore, EL-Mamba exhibits high computational efficiency and reliable generalization capability, indicating its significant potential for application in large-scale areas.

 This study investigates six indoor micro-environments on a residential university campus to assess the impact of sources/activities, occupancy, and ventilation on aerosol properties. Particle number concentration and size distributions were measured using an aerodynamic particle sizer (APS), along with CO2 levels, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Average PM10 concentrations were within WHO limits (45 μg m−3), with a 2-fold increase in PM mass in the administrative office due to higher occupancy. PM mass also increased by 2–5 times in naturally ventilated spaces compared to mechanically ventilated classrooms and hostel rooms. Similar patterns were observed in mess and canteen areas, where fine aerosol levels were higher. Although cooking activity in the kitchen led to high VOC concentrations (∼7 ppm), this did not significantly affect particle mass due to sub-micron dominance. Furthermore, infiltration of outdoor aerosol was evident in hostel rooms and classrooms, where the loss rates of coarser particles were higher. Despite the hostel room's larger room surface area-to-volume ratio and lower ventilation, the total PM concentration was higher than in the classrooms due to additional indoor sources. The highest PM exposure and respiratory deposition occurred in environments affected by outdoor infiltration, such as hostel rooms and classrooms with open windows. Based on International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) model, the highest mass deposition occurred in the head airways (71–81 %), followed by the pulmonary (12–22 %) and the lung (6–7 %) airways. Our findings highlight that PM concentration and deposition are influenced by multiple factors in each micro-environment, emphasizing the need for comprehensive IAQ assessments in building design."

Qomolangma (Everest) using the tethered balloon,"•The first tethered-balloon aerosol measurements were taken at Mt. Qomolangma, China. •The main sources of high-altitude aerosols were North Africa and South Asia. •The ∼6 km a.s.l. marked the boundary between local/regional and remote aerosol source. 
 The vertical distribution of aerosols is crucial for constraining their sources and transport mechanisms. However, high-precision in situ aerosol measurements remain limited in high-altitude regions. Here, we present the first high-resolution in situ vertical profiles of aerosol number concentration (Na) obtained from a tethered balloon at the Qomolangma (Mt. Everest) Station (QOMS) from May 14 to 26, 2022. Fourteen vertical profiles were categorized into three types using K-means clustering analysis: (I) high-altitude single-peak profiles, (II) linearly decreasing profiles, and (III) surface-accumulation profiles. Type I was associated with long-range transport of aerosols from North Africa and South Asia via the westerly jet stream and the South Asian monsoon, respectively, with a peak aerosol number concentration reaching 110 cm−3. Types II and III were related to the diurnal evolution of planetary boundary layer, dominated by local emissions. In Type III, the combined effects of a shallow planetary boundary layer and strong temperature inversions (inversion layer intensity: 0.26 °C per 100 m) led to the accumulation of aerosols near the surface, resulting in a surface aerosol number concentration of 203 cm−3. Analyses of effective diameter and backward trajectory models revealed a clear vertical stratification of aerosol sources, with ∼6 km a.s.l. acting as a critical boundary: Below this altitude, aerosols were mainly originated from local and regional (South Asia) sources, exhibiting a bimodal particle volume size distributions with peaks at 0.45 μm and 2 μm, while above it, they were dominated by remote sources from North Africa and the Middle East, showing a unimodal particle volume size distributions. These results advance understanding of vertical aerosols distributions over the southern Tibetan Plateau, and highlight the importance of altitude-dependent source and transport processes in assessing aerosol–climate interactions."

 In this work, aerosol absorption and scattering properties were investigated to gather additional information on aerosol types and sources. During a one-year campaign in Milan (Italy), a multi-wavelength aethalometer and a nephelometer were operated in parallel. Scattering coefficients are in general scarcely available at urban sites and this was the very first dataset for Milan and, more generally, for an urban site in the Po valley which is a well-known pollution hot-spot in Europe.Time patterns of the absorption and scattering coefficients throughout the year were investigated and Absorption/Scattering Ångström Exponents (AAE and SAE, respectively) were also computed to relate the optical properties to fossil vs. wood fuel combustion emission sources and to small vs. large particle size. The average daily trends for the absorption coefficients reflected the behaviour of the sources, with peaks in the morning due to traffic emissions observed in all seasons, and high values during the night as a consequence of lower mixing heights and, in winter, of domestic heating emissions, too.To gain knowledge about aerosol types and origin an innovative cluster analysis approach using AAE and SAE led to the identification of different aerosol types; this is an easy-to-implement approach which could be applied in monitoring networks for near-real time aerosol types identification. Moreover, episodes affected by specific aerosol types (i.e., fire event, desert dust air mass transport…) were singled out applying a more refined approach combining five intensive optical parameters."

 Accurate knowledge of precipitation at high spatio-temporal resolution is essential for climate studies and hydrological applications, particularly in mountainous regions where traditional models often underperform due to coarse resolution and sparse observational networks. In this study, we present a machine learning-based approach to enhance ERA5 reanalysis precipitation estimates using the satellite-derived IMERG (Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM) product as a reference. We focus on the Greater Alpine Region (GAR), using extreme gradient boosting combined with Shapley additive explanations to identify the most influential ERA5 variables. This method enables the creation of a new daily rainfall dataset, ML-IMEX-GAR (Machine Learning IMERG backward-EXtended precipitation dataset over GAR), at IMERG’s spatial resolution for the historical period 1960–2000.Compared to ERA5, ML-IMEX-GAR reduces the spatiotemporal RMSD against IMERG by approximately 14%, and achieves strong agreement with in-situ observational monthly data, with an R2 of 0.87. These findings demonstrate the potential of machine learning to correct reanalysis biases, improve historical precipitation reconstructions, and support climate change research in data-scarce, complex terrains."

Kirchstetter,Emission factors and optical properties of black and brown carbon emitted at a mixed-conifer forest prescribed burn,"Prescribed burns are controlled fires used to prevent wildfires. Smoke emissions were measured to characterize emission factors and optical properties of black and brown soot particles. Brown particles were emitted at 7–14 times that of black particles and contributed 82 % of atmospheric absorption by particles for ultraviolet light and 23 % for total solar radiation. These findings will improve inventories and climate models for prescribed burns. 
 Prescribed burning is a fuel management practice employed globally that emits carbonaceous aerosols that affect human health and perturb the global climate system. Fuel-based black and brown carbon (BC and BrC) emission factors were calculated from ground and aloft smoke during prescribed burns at a mixed-conifer, montane forest site in the Sierra Nevada in California.  BC emission factors were 0.52 ± 0.42 and 1.0 ± 0.48 g kg−1 for the smoldering and flaming combustion phases. Modified combustion efficiency is a poor predictor of BC emission factor, in this study and published literature. We discuss limitations of using generalized BC to PM2.5 mass emission ratios to generate emission inventories; using BC emission factors measured in this study, we recommend BC to PM2.5 ratios of 0.7 % and 9.5 % for the smoldering and flaming combustion in mixed conifer prescribed burns. We apportioned the measured aerosol spectral absorption between BrC and BC and calculated absorption Ångström exponents (AAE) of 6.26 and 0.67, respectively. Using a BrC-specific absorption cross-section, we estimated BC concentrations and a smoldering combustion BrC emission factor of 7.0 ± 2.7 g kg−1, nearly 14 and 7 times greater than the smoldering and flaming BC emission factors. Furthermore, we estimate that BrC would account for 23 % and 82 %, respectively, of the solar radiation absorbed by the smoldering smoke in the atmosphere integrated over the solar spectrum (300–2500 nm) and in the UV spectrum (300–400 nm), indicating that BrC affects tropospheric photochemistry in addition to atmospheric warming."

Using nationwide observations (2013–2023) across China together with satellite data, we developed a new machine learning approach to decouple the impacts of emission controls and weather changes. Our results show that while emission reductions improved ozone in some regions, climate change is increasingly offsetting these gains, underscoring the need for joint air quality and climate actions. 
 Surface ozone, a major air pollutant with important implications for air quality, ecosystems, and climate, shows long-term trends shaped by both anthropogenic and climatic drivers. Here, we developed a machine learning-based approach, namely the fixed emission approximation (FEA), to decouple the effects of meteorological variability and anthropogenic emissions on summertime ozone trends in China under the clean air actions. Anthropogenic emissions drove an approximately +23.2 ± 1.1 µg m−3 increase in summer maximum daily 8 h average ozone during 2013–2017, followed by an approximately −4.6 ± 1.5 µg m−3 decrease between 2017 and 2020 in response to strengthened emission controls. In contrast, meteorological anomalies, including heatwaves and rainfall conditions, emerged as substantial drivers of ozone variability during 2020–2023. Satellite-derived formaldehyde-to-nitrogen dioxide ratios revealed widespread urban volatile organic compounds-limited regimes for ozone production, with a shift toward nitrogen oxides-limited sensitivity under influence of heatwaves. Extending the FEA framework to assess long-term climate influences from 1970 to 2023, we find that sustained climate warming has driven a substantial increase in urban summertime ozone in China. These results demonstrate that climate change was increasingly offsetting the benefits of emission reductions and highlight the need for integrated ozone mitigation strategies that jointly address emission controls and climate adaptation in a warming world."

Aerosol hygroscopic parameter γ increases from 2014 to 2017 and stabilizes at high levels afterwards, aligning with the changes in NO2-to-SO2 concentration ratio. Moreover, no evident differences are found across seasons, as well as between the free troposphere and boundary layer. 
 Lidar-derived particle backscatter coefficient is commonly used to assess air pollution levels; however, hygroscopic growth can amplify particle backscatter and hinder accurate assessment of particle concentration. This study investigated the hygroscopic growth characteristics of urban anthropogenic aerosols in Wuhan (30.5° N, 114.4° E), central China, using ground-based 532 nm polarization lidar observations during 2010–2024. A total of 192 cases were identified based on the following criteria: (1) the presence of a layer thicker than 300 m; (2) a lidar-derived backscatter coefficient that increases monotonically with simultaneously-measured relative humidity (RH) from radiosonde, and (3) limited variations in key meteorological parameters, including water vapor mixing ratio, potential temperature, and wind speed and direction. Using the Hänel parameterization method, the hygroscopic growth parameter γ was estimated as 0.62 (±0.24), corresponding to a backscatter coefficient enhancement factor of 2.36 at 85 % RH. No evident differences in γ were observed between the boundary layer (0.63 ± 0.25) and free troposphere (0.60 ± 0.24). The annual mean γ increased from 0.49 in 2015 to 0.63 in 2017 and stabilized within 0.6–0.7 after 2018, closely following the evolution of the annual mean NO2-to-SO2 concentration ratio. The minimum seasonal average γ occurred in winter (0.56), while the maximum was observed in autumn (0.64). These results provide a comprehensive characterization of the long-term and seasonal hygroscopicity of pollutants over central China, enhancing our understanding of the influence of hygroscopic growth on lidar-observed particle backscatter coefficients and offering valuable insights for urban air pollution control strategies."

In this study, we developed a method for measuring the amount of microplastics in atmospheric samples. In doing so, we introduced a new way to collect rain/snow samples and a custom software that helps with the analysis of microplastics. We then assessed the precision of our method and tested it on real samples. Our work may be useful for researchers seeking to measure microplastics in environmental samples. 
 Microplastics (MPs) are environmental contaminants of global concern, and the atmosphere may play an important role in their environmental distribution. In this study, we developed a tailored analytical chain – including sample collection, processing, and analysis based on optical microscopy and focal plane array μ-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FPA-μ-FTIR) – to quantify 20–215 µm MPs (excluding tire wear particles) in wet and dry atmospheric deposition samples. We present a novel sampling setup to collect particulate wet deposition, which consists of an on-site precipitation filtration device. Validation of the sampling setup via spike-recovery experiments using surrogate standards resulted in average recoveries of approximately 90 %, suggesting limited MP losses. Additionally, we developed a custom software platform that combines the results from optical microscopy and chemical imaging obtained through FPA-μ-FTIR. Furthermore, an assessment of the total measurement uncertainty was made by addressing each step of the analytical chain individually. The resulting total expanded uncertainty was approximately 90 % for determining MP numbers in a single wet or dry deposition sample. The conversion of MP numbers and associated size information into MP mass was estimated to generate an additional systematic error of 50 %. Based on analyses of blanks, the critical level and the limit of detection, number-based thresholds for minimizing false positives and false negatives, were 29 and 58 MPs per analyzed subsample, respectively. The analytical chain was applied to quantify the MP content in wet and dry atmospheric deposition samples collected at a suburban site in Switzerland. The principles and methodology used in this study to calculate the uncertainties, recoveries and limits of detection are transferrable to other analytical methods intended for MP analysis. Such an assessment of method-specific uncertainties is an important step towards enhancing the comparability of MP (monitoring) data."

It was developed using large-scale wheat sample generation combined with region-specific feature selection strategies. The dataset demonstrates high accuracy (overall accuracy > 0.91) and offers detailed spatial information to support agricultural monitoring and food security efforts in China. 
 Wheat, as one of the main food crops in the world, plays a vital role in shaping agricultural trade patterns. China is the largest producer and consumer of wheat globally, characterized by extensive cultivation areas and diverse planting systems. However, current remote sensing-based wheat mapping studies often rely on uniform phenological feature variables, without adequately accounting for the significant differences in wheat growth cycles across China's diverse agro-ecological zones. In addition, the lack of large-scale training samples severely limits both the accuracy and the spatial-temporal generalization capacity. Furthermore, existing research in China focuses mainly on winter wheat monitoring and mapping, while spring wheat research remains largely inadequate, especially in the major spring wheat-producing areas of northern China, resulting in limited availability of targeted remote sensing products. These limitations hinder the development of high-accuracy, spatially comprehensive wheat mapping datasets and reduce the completeness of agricultural monitoring and food security assessments. To address these issues, this study proposes a cross-regional training sample generation method that integrates time-series remote sensing data with crop distribution products. Furthermore, a province-level, differentiated feature selection strategy is introduced to enhance the regional adaptability and classification performance of the model. Based on these methods, we developed 10 m resolution wheat distribution dataset (CN_Wheat10) covering the years 2018–2024. The dataset includes spring and winter wheat harvested area maps for 15 provinces and detailed winter wheat planted area maps for 10 provinces across China. Validation using a large-scale reference dataset built from field surveys and high-resolution imagery visual interpretation indicates that CN_Wheat10 achieves mapping accuracies above 0.93 for winter wheat and above 0.91 for spring wheat. When compared with wheat area statistics from the China Statistical Yearbook, the coefficient of determination (R2) exceeds 0.94 at the provincial level and remains above 0.88 at the municipal level. Spatially, wheat cultivation in China is characterized by a pattern of concentration in the east, dispersion in the west, a dominance of winter wheat, and a supplementary role of spring wheat. CN_Wheat10 provides spatial distribution information on both spring and winter wheat harvested areas and winter wheat planted regions in key production areas. Compared with existing products that mainly focus on winter wheat, this dataset expands both the spatial coverage and the crop types, offering more comprehensive data support for agricultural monitoring and management in China.

The long-term daily lake ice coverage, annual ice phenology, and the probability of complete ice-cover occurrence were produced for 32800 global lakes using gap-filled MODIS data from 2002 to 2024. Patterns and trends of ice phenology and ice-cover status quantitatively revealed that how lakes respond to the climate change. The dataset provides a valuable resource for hydrology, ecology and climate research. 
 Lake ice is an essential component of the terrestrial cryosphere and plays an important role in the socioeconomic and ecological systems of cold regions. However, existing lake ice datasets generally suffer from poor temporal continuity, limited spatial coverage, and a lack of observations for small and medium-sized lakes. Consequently, the global spatial patterns and long-term trends of lake ice have remained insufficiently understood. In this study, using MODIS observations, we developed global datasets of daily lake ice coverage (LIC), annual lake ice-cover status, annual lake ice phenology (LIP), and the probability of complete ice-cover occurrence (PCIO), including 32,800 lakes across global cold climate regions from 2002 through 2024. Validation against multiple remote sensing datasets demonstrated high accuracy and confirmed that our Lake Ice – Cold Climate Regions dataset (LI-CCR) effectively captures the spatiotemporal evolution of the lake ice zone. Quality assessments were conducted for both LIC and LIP, and the information was included as an integral component of the LI-CCR. The results show that most cold regions lakes in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere freeze before November (May) and melt from May (November) onward, with an average ice cover duration of about 200 days. Presently 89 % of the lakes experience completely frozen annually, and the number of intermittent or even ice-free lakes is increasing under the warming climate.

 Mesoscale Convective Complexes (MCCs) are major convective weather systems occurring in midlatitude regions, typically associated with significant weather phenomena such as heavy rainfall, thunderstorms, strong winds, and hail.

The algorithm is then applied to generate an hourly dataset of MCC variables over mainland China from June 2015 to December 2024. The dataset encompasses variables describing the spatial extent of the cold-core region (CTT < -52 °C) of MCCs, the minimum cloud-top temperature within the cold cloud shields, and the geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) of the centroids of the cold cloud shields. This work also conducts a preliminary analysis of the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of MCCs over mainland China based on the dataset. Results indicate that MCCs occur more frequently in Southwest China than in other regions of the country, and over 70 % of MCC events occur in summer both in Southwest China and mainland China.

Using idealized setups and thunderstorm case studies, we find differences in numerical diffusion and extreme precipitation rates due to changed coupling with the remaining microphysics. Neither method develops alarming instabilities in full model setups; both can be safely used. 
 In the ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model, the Seifert-Beheng two-moment microphysics scheme is one approach to simulate clouds with different hydrometeor classes. In this bulk description, sedimentation is modeled by advecting the first two moments (number and mass densities) of the hydrometeor size distributions with velocities derived from fitting a generalized gamma distribution to the moments. This method implicitly relies on the diffusive properties of the numerical advection schemes to obtain results in closer agreement with the exact spectral solution. The implementation in ICON offers both a semi-implicit and largely untested explicit method for sedimentation. Currently, the semi-implicit scheme is substantially slower on graphics processing units (GPUs), which is particularly relevant considering the recent rise of GPUs in supercomputing; this raises the question of whether the explicit scheme is a viable alternative.We provide a detailed examination of both sedimentation schemes, their differences, and underlying assumptions. Using idealized one-dimensional experiments, we identify a minor issue in the default semi-implicit scheme (flux limiter artifacts) and propose a solution. Additionally, we show that the explicit scheme exhibits less numerical diffusion, though some diffusion is crucial for accurate bulk sedimentation. Purely horizontal grid refinement leads to increased diffusion in the explicit scheme, whereas finer vertical resolutions may result in insufficient diffusion, especially for the explicit scheme. An analysis of six case studies with thunderstorms reveals that the explicit scheme gives rise to more jagged patterns in the hydrometeor profiles, although without concerning instabilities. Furthermore, some differences in hail and graupel precipitation rates can be attributed to different ways of considering the microphysical source terms (e.g., hydrometeor interactions) during the sedimentation step."

During spring, atmospheric mercury and ozone depletion events (AMDEs and ODEs) drive rapid declines in gaseous elemental mercury (Hg0) and ozone (O3), promoting mercury deposition to snow, ice, and marine ecosystems. Despite three decades of research, AMDEs have been documented almost exclusively at coastal land-based stations, leaving their occurrence and mechanisms over oceanic sea-ice poorly constrained. To address this gap, we conducted a research cruise in the Arctic marginal ice zone to study the connections between sea-ice and atmospheric Hg chemistry. We measured atmospheric Hg0, reactive gaseous Hg (RGM), and O3 along the cruise track, identifying the simultaneous occurrences of AMDEs and ODEs. Air mass back-trajectory analysis combined with sea-ice images from satellite remote sensing revealed that these depletion events occurred exclusively when air masses originated from over sea-ice and were near its surface. Our findings confirm that Arctic sea-ice plays a pivotal role in initiating AMDEs observed in the marginal ice zone, driven by halogen release from the sea-ice surface. This study advances understanding of the interplay between sea-ice dynamics and atmospheric chemistry, with important implications for Hg deposition in polar ecosystems and the consequences for human and wildlife health, given the potential impacts of a rapidly changing Arctic."

Stephenson,Breaking the link: warming disrupts early-season rainfall predictability in the Caribbean,"Breaking the link: warming disrupts early-season rainfall predictability in the Caribbean 
 Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the tropical North Atlantic have historically served as reliable predictors of early-season rainfall across the Caribbean. In particular, rainfall onset has been linked to SSTs exceeding the convective threshold necessary to support deep convection. However, recent warming trends appear to have altered this relationship. Here, we show that although SSTs routinely exceed the convective threshold earlier in the season, early rainfall has not increased. This decoupling reflects a shift in the atmospheric state, with enhanced stability, evidenced by reduced convective available potential energy and increased convective inhibition, increasingly suppressing convection. Reduced rainfall results in a more persistent Caribbean Low-Level Jet (CLLJ), further inhibiting rainfall by promoting subsidence and dry air advection. Correlations indicate that dynamic atmospheric variables now explain a larger share of rainfall variability than absolute SSTs. These findings signal a regime shift in Caribbean rainfall dynamics and raise concerns about the declining utility of SST-based predictors under continued climate warming. These results have significant implications for seasonal forecasting and adaptation planning across Caribbean Small Island Developing States."

 Africa’s coastal regions face accelerating sea level rise compounded by climate variability. Here we analyze satellite altimetry data from 1993 to 2024 across African marine domains. The 2023–2024 El Niño produced the largest detrended sea level anomaly on record (27 mm), exceeding even the stronger 1997–1998 event. This exceptional response arose from ocean preconditioning: record-positive Indian Ocean Dipole, Atlantic Niño, and Tropical North Atlantic indices preceded and amplified El Niño forcing, while anomalous winds suppressed upwelling and record stratification trapped surface heat, quadrupling ocean heat content. Thermal expansion accounted for over 70% of this event’s total anomaly, reaching nearly 30 mm across the African marine domain. Sea levels rose 11.26 cm since 1993, accelerating at 0.14 mm.yr-2, exceeding the global average. These findings reveal compound threats to low-lying deltas and Small Island Developing States from flooding, ongoing land subsidence, and declining marine productivity.

 The exchange of carbon between oceanic plates, the deep Earth, and the atmosphere plays a significant role in modulating global climate. Icehouse-greenhouse climate fluctuations have been attributed to changes in palaeogeography and solid Earth degassing, particularly along continental arcs, to arc weathering and to the sequestration of carbon into oceanic carbonate-rich sediments. However, the proportions of these contributions and their effect on modulating global climate are poorly constrained. Here we show that the changing balance between volcanic outgassing and carbon sequestration into oceanic lithosphere is the key driver for major climate shifts. Combined volcanic arc, mid-ocean ridge and continental rift emissions exceed carbon sequestration during greenhouse climates. In contrast, oceanic plate sequestration exceeds emissions during icehouse climates. Our results challenge the long-held view that carbon degassing along volcanic arcs is the main contributor to atmospheric carbon, suggesting instead that mid-ocean ridge and rift degassing surpass arc emissions before 100 Ma. Combined degassing from mid-ocean ridges and continental rifts outweigh volcanic arc emissions before 50 Ma, according to thermodynamic modelling coupled to tectonic reconstructions of carbon reservoir fluxes analysis."

 Aerosols significantly impact solar radiation forecasts, but substantial uncertainties persist in numerical models due to inadequate aerosol representation. This study develops a data assimilation framework integrating hourly surface-level particulate matter (PM₂.₅) retrievals from the FY-4B geostationary satellite into the WRF-Chem model with solar radiation diagnostics via the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) three-dimensional variational (3DVAR) system. Assimilation experiments conducted over central and eastern China in November 2022 demonstrate marked improvements in PM₂.₅ forecasts, with correlation coefficients increasing from 0.39 to 0.82, and root mean square error (RMSE) decreasing by approximately 45%. Improved aerosol initial conditions significantly reduce uncertainties in surface downward shortwave radiation (SWDOWN) predictions, lowering midday bias by over 50% and RMSE by roughly 40% across the domain. Consistent forecast enhancements were verified through spatiotemporal analyses across various pollution levels. These results highlight the practical value of assimilating hourly FY-4B PM₂.₅ retrievals for simultaneously improving air quality and solar radiation forecasts. The proposed assimilation approach offers a robust, replicable solution for near-real-time operational forecasting, thereby supporting photovoltaic energy planning and effective air quality management."

 Rapidly intensifying tropical cyclones (TCs) are among the most dangerous and least predictable weather systems. In this work, we focus on two intense Atlantic TCs that showed rapid intensification (RI, defined as at least 36 hPa deepening in 24 h) and which impacted the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. This study focused on how sea surface temperature (SST) and ocean mixed-layer depth (OMLD) modulate the rapid intensification (RI) and maximum intensity (MI) of two hurricanes, Wilma and Rita (2005). Using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with a simplified 1D ocean model, 20 simulations were performed to systematically vary SST (±1–3 °C) and OMLD (doubled or halved), as well as remove observed SST anomalies (SSTA). Results show that SST dominates TC intensity changes from around 15–20 hPa °C−1, and correspondingly higher deepening rates. Warmer simulations also exhibit an increased energy transfer from the ocean, supporting increased near-surface equivalent potential temperature, a more symmetrical wind field and elevated accumulated cyclone energy (ACE). By contrast, deeper OMLD enhances thermodynamic support but is constrained by SST conditions, limiting the total surface heat flux in the storm's vicinity. Results also stress that remote heat fluxes across a broader region, not just beneath the storm core, play a crucial role in determining maximum intensity and deepening. Westward landfall shifts up to 300 km are observed in +3 °C scenarios, emphasizing the potential of ocean heat in altering trajectories. These findings highlight the critical importance of accurately representing upper-ocean thermal structures to improve predictions of TC intensity and trajectories, particularly as warmer future SSTs may lead to more frequent and dynamically evolving hurricanes."

Using high-resolution satellite precipitation data from 1998–2023, this study investigates changes in the spatial inhomogeneity of TC rainfall across China. Results show that TC rainfall inhomogeneity decreases significantly by about 65%, indicating a reduced rainfall in historically high-TC-rainfall areas and an increase in low-TC-rainfall areas. Regionally, this decline is mainly governed by the intra‐regional component in East China, where opposing trends between high- and low-rainfall areas have substantially reduced spatial disparities. In contrast, North China shows a marked increase in TC rainfall, accompanied by increased intra‐regional but decreased inter‐regional inhomogeneity, largely offsetting each other. Other regions exhibit minor or insignificant contributions. These spatial reorganizations of TC rainfall in East and North China are closely linked to the northward migration of TC activity in recent decades, driven by reduced landfalling TCs over Taiwan and Fujian and increased inland penetration of TCs into East and North China. The findings reveal a restructuring of TC rainfall patterns and emphasize the growing regional contrasts in TC‐related hydroclimatic impacts, providing new insights for disaster risk assessments and regional climate adaptation strategies in China."

In the present climate, positive SAM phases enhance Ekman-driven northward nutrient transport, leading to delayed increases in chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations in the mid-latitude South Pacific. However, the extent to which this relationship will persist under future climate change remains uncertain. Here, we investigate future changes in the SAM–Chl-a relationship using Community Earth System Model version 2 Large Ensemble simulations under the shared socioeconomic pathway3−7.0 scenario. A subset of ensemble members that successfully reproduce observed present-day SAM–Chl-a lag correlations was selected for analysis. In the historical period (1970–2014), Chl-a anomalies in the mid-latitude eastern South Pacific show a distinct peak approximately three months after positive SAM events, associated with enhanced northward nutrient transport. In contrast, future projections (2070–2100) reveal a weakened or absent lagged response, coinciding with reduced westerly wind anomalies and diminished Ekman transport. These results suggest that the SAM’s influence to regulate marine productivity in the mid-latitude South Pacific may decline under continued climate change. This has important implications for future biogeochemical dynamics and highlights the need for high-resolution modeling to better represent fine-scale ocean–atmosphere interactions."

While past research has focused on tide-surge or tide-river interactions, the relationships among tidal constituents themselves remain unexplored. Here we present the first global analysis of tidal constituent co-variability using tide gauge records available since mid–20th century. For each gauge, we identify the dominant constituent and evaluate its rank correlation with other major constituents (M2, N2, S2, O1, K1, MK3, MS4) using a moving window approach that ensures representing nonlinear interactions in high temporal resolution. Correlations were first quantified over the full observational record to characterize the multi-decadal co-variability across the observation network. Subsequently, comparisons between an earlier period (1950–1980) and a more recent period (1981–2019) were conducted to evaluate the presence of nonstationarity in these relationships. Finally, correlation structures were examined under distinct El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases to assess the extent to which large-scale climate variability modulates these dependencies. Results show that tidal constituents exhibit significant co-variability at roughly one-fifth of stations analyzed, with significant changes over time. Significantly larger number of locations (almost twice) exhibit co-variability in the recent era when compared to the earlier period (especially in the North Pacific). ENSO further modulates these relationships, with distinct patterns found during El Niño and La Niña years. These findings reveal that tidal constituents do not vary independently, but co-evolve under both interannual climate variability and long-term change. Recognizing this overlooked dimension of tides provides new insight into tidal dynamics and has important implications for assessing future compound coastal flooding in a warming climate."

Using kernel principal component analysis and Gaussian mixture modeling, we identify five distinct transit system types: Metro Bus–Rail, Mid-Sized Urban, Hybrid Multimodal, Urban Specialized, and Diverse Operations. We also discover a gap in diesel consumption reporting (76% of systems), which are predominantly of the Mid-Sized Urban type. To bridge this critical data gap, we apply extreme gradient boosting to predict the diesel consumption for 1674 underreported systems. We then estimate lifecycle emissions, accounting for regional grid carbon intensity. The result highlights significant variability in diesel consumption and emissions across transit types, with Metro Bus–Rail systems contributing the highest emissions. To evaluate decarbonization potential, we simulate fleet electrification and grid decarbonization. Our scenario analyses indicate that up to 82% of 10.27 MMTCO2e diesel-based transit emissions can be eliminated through fleet electrification, with further grid decarbonization eliminating the remainder. These findings provide actionable insights for policymakers to prioritize electrification, optimize resource allocation, and support sustainable transit strategies in the U.S."

Changes to shallow subsurface hydrological processes can drive extensive ecological and biogeochemical changes in addition to potential surface hydrologic regime shifts. This study uses a pan-Arctic geospatial approach to classify shallow, unconfined Arctic aquifers (supra-permafrost aquifers) as topography-limited (TL) (characterized by low permeability, wet climate, and/or low slopes) or recharge-limited (high permeability, dry climate and/or steep slopes) based on the water table ratio framework. Under current conditions, the continuous and discontinuous permafrost zones were determined to be predominantly (65%) TL, with an average net decrease of 5.6% by the year 2100 under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 conditions. This apparent stability masks local-scale heterogeneity, with change in aquifer function projected at dispersed locations throughout the Arctic, and in clustered hot spots in Siberia and the central Canadian Arctic. Coastal zones around the Arctic are more TL (94%) compared to the overall average, leaving them especially vulnerable to ocean-driven impacts on groundwater such as subsurface seawater intrusion or groundwater flooding. Arctic coasts in Siberia and eastern Canada are also particularly susceptible to water table rise due to high relative sea-level rise which may exceed the active layer thickness and result in substantive changes to saturation. Classification results are sensitive to input values, particularly hydraulic conductivity, which remains a source of uncertainty in the analysis. Despite the sparsity of Arctic data, the available open-source datasets provide valuable insight into broad spatiotemporal trends in aquifer function and highlight particularly vulnerable regions and geographic areas where uncertainty should drive additional data collection and study. These results provide new context for conceptualizing changes to shallow Arctic aquifers as the climate evolves in the 21st century."

Predictive models have been developed to support contamination risk assessment and management strategies, typically relying on meteorological data from local weather stations. While these inputs offer high accuracy, their limited spatial coverage and lack of forecasting capability reduce their application as early warning systems and in-season decision support. This study evaluates the integration of ERA5-Land reanalysis and seasonal climate forecasts into AFLA-maize, a mechanistic model for predicting aflatoxin B1 contamination, to extend its spatial and temporal applicability. Using historical data from the Emilia-Romagna, Italy (2008–2025), we tested bias-adjusted ERA5-Land inputs and developed a hybrid forecasting approach combining reanalysis data for the early-season with adjusted forecasts for the later crop stages. Results show that simulations driven by ERA5-Land reproduced contamination probability in 91% of years compared to station-based results, supporting its use in regions with low quality observations or missing station networks. Hybrid integrations of bias-adjusted forecasts provided contamination risk assessments 3–8 weeks ahead of harvest, showing the trade-off between lead time and accuracy. Forecast initialized later in the season (August) achieved much higher accuracy (up to 91%) but offer less time for action, whereas earlier initializations (June, July) bear larger uncertainty (accuracy of 88%–93%) but extended the decision windows. Furthermore, the availability of ensemble forecasts allows to quantify the uncertainty, providing probability ranges across members that support risk communication and early warning outputs. In summary, the presented approach extends AFLA-maize into a scalable and transferable tool for anticipatory risk management, supporting climate-resilient agriculture and food safety through publicly available meteorological data."

Here, using 2686 largely regulation-free catchments across the world, we find that in some regions ARs are linked to over 70% of the largest precipitation and streamflow events. AR related precipitation significantly shortens the recurrence intervals of large flood events, making them 2–8 times more likely. In parts of Northern America, Europe and Australia, rare flood events are up to 12 times more likely when an AR is present.

These tyhoons also push ozone-rich air from high altitudes down to ground level. When multiple north-moving typhoons occur back-to-back, they cause widespread and long-lasting ozone pollution. Vertical air currents during these events can contribute up to 16 % of boundary layer ozone. 
 Ozone (O3) pollution has emerged as one of the core challenges in atmospheric environmental governance in China, particularly in Guangdong Province. As a crucial weather system during East Asian summers, typhoons exert profound influences on O3 formation, accumulation, and transboundary transport through variations in their tracks and intensities. This study examined 237 historical typhoons approaching or making landfall in China between 2013–2023 classifying them into three distinct trajectory types using k-means clustering: westward-moving typhoons (Type 1), Distant northward-recurving typhoons (Type 2) and Proximal northward-recurving typhoons (Type 3). By integrating ground-based observations, reanalysis data, and WRF-CMAQ model simulations, the mechanisms through which typhoon tracks affect ozone pollution in Guangdong Province were investigated. The results demonstrate that for Guangdong Province, proximal northward-recurving typhoons induce more extreme meteorological conditions compared to westward-moving and distant northward-moving typhoons. The analysis of consecutive northward-moving typhoons' impact on ozone pollution in Guangdong Province reveals that surface photochemical reactions served as the dominant factor, while vertical downward transport of upper-level ozone acted as a secondary contributor. Nevertheless, the long-range vertical transport induced by typhoons cannot be neglected. During this event, vertical transport contributed up to 39.9 ppbv to near-surface (100 m) ozone concentrations, with cross-boundary-layer transport accounting for up to 16 % of boundary layer ozone concentrations, demonstrating that typhoon-induced vertical transport significantly enhances boundary layer ozone levels and consequently worsens surface pollution. Additionally, analysis of the backward trajectories and 3-dimensional ozone concentration fields of 237 typhoons indicates that northward-moving typhoons significantly enhance the downward transport of ozone, consequently increasing the ozone concentration at the central point of Guangdong Province by 2.5–14.0 ppbv (Type 2) and 0.3–14.5 ppbv (Type 3) within the 250–900 hPa layer."

 Since 1994, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene isomers (BTEX) are monitored in the ambient air at Dübendorf (DUE) in the suburban area of Zurich city in Switzerland. Overall, BTEX concentrations decreased up to 89 % in ambient air in DUE notably due to the introduction of regulations concerning the air quality such as limiting benzene concentrations in car fuel or the introduction of the incentive tax on volatile organic compounds (VOC) in 2000 in Switzerland. While BTEX was one of the major VOCs compound classes in 1994 (33 % of the total non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC)), BTEX contribution to total NMHC significantly decreased to 6.3 % in 2024. Before 2000, traffic exhaust emissions were the dominant source of BTEX to the ambient air with a toluene-to-benzene (T : B) ratio of 2.4 ± 0.1.

As BTEX are important ozone and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) precursors, the long-term measurements in Dübendorf was complemented with VOC data from the urban background station at Kaserne Zurich to assess the contribution of BTEX to ambient VOC composition. While the BTEX contribution to ozone formation potential (OFP) has decreased from 25 % in 2005 to 8 % in 2024, their relative contribution to SOA formation potential remains high, contributing to 80 % of the SOA formation potential of the total VOCs measured in Zurich in 2024."

Stillwell;Adam Karboski;Scott M. Spuler,Signal processing to denoise and retrieve water vapor from multi-pulse-length lidar data,"A new processing method for lidar data obtained from rapidly changing laser pulse lengths enables measurement of atmospheric water vapor from the ground up to 6 km. The technique blends all captured data to reveal hidden water vapor structures, especially near the surface. This solution offers continuous, high-resolution insights, key for improving weather forecasts. It showcases how flexible laser technology can enhance atmospheric observation. 
 Recent hardware developments for the MicroPulse DIAL enable the transmitter to switch between output pulses that are “longer” (higher pulse energy) and “shorter” (low pulse energy) in duration on a shot-to-shot basis. While the longer laser pulses broadly result in higher signal-to-noise ratio, they have the shortcoming of blanking the detector in the lowest ranges and smearing out the scene in range. Conversely, shorter pulses enable observations closer to the instrument, smear the scene relatively little, but have low signal-to-noise ratio. In this work, we show that leveraging Poisson Total Variation with forward modeling enables merged estimates of backscatter and water vapor. This signal processing technique leverages the advantages of each pulse length configuration, providing better data availability and higher resolution over a broader altitude range than data processed using only one of the pulse lengths. An intercomparison with radiosondes demonstrates that this new hardware configuration and processing approach enable retrievals of absolute humidity starting at 100 m extending up to 6 km, capturing complex water vapor structure throughout this range. The retrievals are also contrasted with ERA5 reanalysis which suggests that there are instances where the model and reanalysis products are unlikely to produce accurate representation of water vapor fields in the atmosphere, thus emphasizing the value of continuous, high-vertical-resolution active thermodynamic profiling observations."

We built the first detailed atlas for China's key Yangtze River Delta using radar and optical satellites, then manually verified every installation over ten years. Our map reveals explosive growth to 145.4 km² and provides a vital tool for sustainable energy planning and environmental monitoring. 
 China hosts approximately 97 % of the world's water-surface photovoltaics (WPV), with nearly two-thirds of its national capacity concentrated in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), a densely populated economic powerhouse facing intense land-energy trade-offs. Despite this dominance, no high-resolution, decade-long inventory has existed to track this rapid expansion. WPV detection using optical RS imagery is severely limited by persistent cloud cover, water surface reflections, and spectral confusion, compromising long-term consistency over aquatic environments. Here, we developed a multi-sensor fusion framework integrating all-weather Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and annual composite Sentinel-2 optical imagery. Key features include six Sentinel-2 bands, spectral indices (NDVI, MNDWI, NDBI, NDPI, and SAVI), texture metrics, and dual-polarization SAR backscatter. We trained a Random Forest classifier on 55,849 verified samples to generate annual WPV maps for 2015–2024. Afterwards, we applied post-processing procedures, including noise removal, patch merging, and area thresholding, and further validated installation years and eliminated errors through manual inspection of Google Earth time-series imagery. The well-constructed dataset of the first 10 m-resolution WPV atlas for the YRD maps 401 validated projects with a cumulative area of 145.4 km2 by 2024. It outperforms existing global PV inventories with an overall accuracy of 97.3 % and a Kappa coefficient of 0.94. The results reveal rapid expansion from 17.4 km2 in 2015 to 145.4 km2 in 2024, with 87 % deployed on natural lakes, with a marked shift in leadership from Jiangsu to Anhui, and clear spatial clustering near grid infrastructure and stable water bodies. This high-fidelity inventory provides a robust foundation for monitoring WPV evolution, assessing environmental impacts, and informing sustainable energy planning in the world's leading floating solar region."

However, its transport in large lakes remains poorly understood due to its instability, scarcity, and heterogeneity, as well as the complex hydrodynamics of lakes. We developed biodegradable synthetic DNA particles (sDNAp) that encapsulate DNA fragments with unique sequences to serve as quantitative tracers for investigating eDNA transport. This sDNAp tracer was deployed in Cayuga Lake (NY, USA; 172 km2 surface area) and its dispersion was monitored for 33 h over ∼11 km2 through depth-integrated water sampling followed by quantitative PCR analysis. Despite gram-scale release quantities, sDNAp were detected over 7 km from the source after more than a day, at concentrations as low as ∼3–5 particles mL–1, demonstrating high sensitivity and durability. A 3D hydrodynamic model incorporating wind-driven circulation and stratification reproduced key dispersion patterns observed in the field. Forward particle-tracking simulations captured both horizontal advection and vertical displacement, while backward simulations revealed that vertical position sensitivity limited the accuracy of source attribution. This approach provides one of the first lake-scale demonstrations that time-resolved, probabilistic attribution of natural eDNA sources is feasible under favorable conditions. Using sDNAp tracers, it also establishes a robust benchmark for future studies on eDNA transport in large waterbodies."

Accurate monitoring of its emissions is thus essential for understanding biosphere–atmosphere feedbacks, particularly under climate extremes. We develop a regression-based inversion framework to estimate global monthly biogenic isoprene emissions (2019–2024), integrating TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) HCHO columns and LMDZ-INCA atmospheric transport model. Our inversion yields a global annual mean emission of 456 ± 249 TgC yr–1, with a minimum in 2022 (437 TgC, 1.4σ below multiyear mean) and a peak in 2024 (477 TgC, 1.5σ above), closely tracking global annual land surface temperature variations (R = 0.95). Emission anomalies are most pronounced in tropical regions contributing over 80% of global total anomalies during the 2020–2023 La Niña (−30 TgC), 2023–2024 El Niño (+11 TgC), and 2024 Northern Hemisphere extreme warming events (+15 TgC). Attribution analysis confirms surface temperature as the dominant driver of biogenic isoprene anomalies, with increasing sensitivity in Northern high-latitude zones under warming conditions. The updated emissions improve spatial agreement and reduce bias in LMDZ-INCA simulations against independent satellite-based isoprene and ground-based HCHO observations. This work delivers the first HCHO-constrained global isoprene emission data set through 2024, supporting air quality, oxidant budget, and climate feedback studies."

These dual capabilities are vital to manage emissions and supply metals (e.g., nickel) necessary for rapidly upscaling energy and data technologies. To understand subsurface carbonation reaction pathways and assess mineralization potential in the Tamarack Intrusive Complex (TIC), we reacted a suite of Tamarack Bowl intrusion olivine (BIO) samples with aqueous-dissolved and liquid or supercritical CO2 (scCO2) at 90 bar and 21–90 °C. Samples were characterized pre- and postreaction with multiple geochemical and mineralogical techniques, and results indicate mineral dissolution followed by magnesite precipitation. Pseudo in situ Identical Location Transmission Electron Microscopy (IL-TEM) experiments revealed that a carbonation reaction of TIC BIO peridotite with water-saturated scCO2 formed aragonite nanocrystals on an altered plagioclase surface and induced dissolution of nickel-bearing forsteritic olivine. The presence of nanoscale-resolved carbonation products identified by IL-TEM, coupled with carbonate transformation rates quantified in batch reactions, suggests that the TIC BIO resource can conservatively store 320–1,070 million metric tonnes (MMT) of CO2 via mineralization while mobilizing 0.9–3.1 MMT of nickel if only 5% of the TIC rock volume is accessed."

Janiga,Subseasonal Forecasts of TC Activity in the Western North Pacific in Navy's Earth System Prediction Capability,We evaluate the ability of Navy's Earth System Prediction Capability (Navy ESPC) to forecast tropical cyclone (TC) activity in the Western North Pacific basin in the subseasonal timeframe. Navy ESPC forecasts of TCs were added to a logistic regression model that also incorporated the Madden‐Julian Oscillation (MJO) and El Niño Southern Oscillation to forecast basin‐wide TC activity. The skill of the statistical‐dynamical model at 14‐day lead times doubled when forecasted accumulated cyclone energy from Navy ESPC was incorporated into the model. This suggests that Navy ESPC TC tracks contain information that is independent from the MJO. An analysis of forecasted TC positions also suggests that the model has skill in forecasting TC track out to 21 days. These results suggest that combining TC tracks and large‐scale environmental information in a statistical‐dynamical model offers a promising path forward for predictions of basin‐scale or even sub‐basin‐scale subseasonal TC activity.

The observed STEVE‐Picket Fence transition indicates that these phenomena may share the same subauroral ion drift channel, yet are modulated by local Ne structure.

This study investigates the performance and challenges of using TEMPO versus TROPOMI measurements to constrain anthropogenic nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. The accuracy of TEMPO and TROPOMI NO2 tropospheric columns are assessed using Pandora observations, finding a low bias of 9%–12.3% in TEMPO, and TROPOMI data during August 2023, while TEMPO midday and late afternoon observations are less of low bias. Top‐down NOx emissions derived by midday TEMPO and TROPOMI data are generally consistent over urban areas, being 5%–20% lower than bottom‐up emissions provided by the 2021 GReenhouse gas And Air Pollutants Emissions System (GRA2PES), and align with 2023 GRA2PES emissions, demonstrating the reliability of using satellite data for timely updates of bottom‐up inventories. However, assimilating additional morning/late afternoon TEMPO data leads to the poorest top‐down NOx emissions, likely resulting from larger negative measurement biases. NOx emission inversions effectively mitigate NOx overprediction, though the top‐down NOx emissions might be over‐corrected in urban cores. NOx emissions optimization also improves ozone forecasts by reducing the model's positive biases, especially when assimilating midday TEMPO data. Our study suggests that TEMPO midday observations provide better constraints on the magnitude and spatiotemporal variation of anthropogenic NOx emissions than TROPOMI, while morning TEMPO v3 data should be used cautiously due to potential negative impact on NOx emissions inversion."

The analysis identifies 439 SBJ events, with a mean maximum wind speed of 25.6 ms−1 ${\text{ms}}^{-1}$ parallel to the Sierra, an average duration of 14.2 hr, and a typical altitude of maximum wind near 1.05 km. Previous studies show that many extreme cool‐season precipitation events occur when landfalling atmospheric rivers (ARs) and SBJs coincide. During the study period, 220 ARs made landfall at San Francisco with 65% of them containing an SBJ. Alternatively, only 43% of SBJs occurred during a landfalling AR at San Francisco. Stronger SBJs also tended to coincide with higher IVT and stronger ARs, while weaker SBJs aligned with weaker ARs. ARs with higher IVT values also more frequently contained an SBJ. A precipitation analysis revealed that SBJ events accounted for up to 40% of the cool‐season precipitation, with maxima from the coast north of San Francisco through the Central Valley and into the Mt. Shasta–Trinity Alps region. AR events similarly contributed up to 50%, with a similar spatial pattern. When SBJs and ARs occurred together, they produced more than 30% of the seasonal precipitation, with maxima across the coastal ranges and into the northern Central Valley. Zonal and meridional precipitation transects across Oroville (39.5°N, 121.6°W) further illustrates how SBJs and ARs enhanced precipitation over the northern Central Valley, the Sierra, and the Mt.

These contrail‐cirrus contribute significantly to the aviation‐induced radiative forcing. While past modeling studies have examined contrail‐cirrus across various atmospheric and aircraft‐type dependent parameters, they have focused on conventional kerosene combustion. In this study, we investigate how the switch to an alternative propulsion system, such as hydrogen combustion, may alter contrail‐cirrus properties using the large‐eddy simulation (LES) model EULAG coupled with the Lagrangian Cloud Module (LCM), a particle‐based microphysics module. Building on prior work that modeled hydrogen contrails during the vortex phase, we use those results to initialize the subsequent contrail‐cirrus evolution. We explore a wide range of background meteorological conditions, including variations of ambient temperature, relative humidity with respect to ice, vertical wind shear, and updraft velocity, and assess two aircraft types. Key contrail properties, such as total ice crystal number and mass, are found to be most sensitive to the initial number of ice crystals and ambient temperature. We show that reducing the number of initially formed ice crystals substantially decreases contrail radiative impact. This is primarily due to a shorter contrail‐cirrus lifetime, driven by the earlier onset and more efficient sedimentation of the fewer but larger ice crystals. Moreover, the relationship between radiative impact and initial ice crystal number is nonlinear, consistent with previous studies."

We examine how cloud‐surface coupling (or the strength of the marine boundary layer (MBL) stratification that limits vertical turbulent mixing and convection) impacts the vertical transport of aerosols, and how injected aerosols influence cloud properties and associated cloud radiative effects during the SCT. By injecting aerosols at different stages of the SCT, noting that cloud is more decoupled from the surface over time due to entrainment warming, we find that cloud‐surface coupling significantly affects aerosol vertical transport. However, injection timing (before drizzle if any) does not notably affect the SCT and the efficiency of marine cloud brightening, because aerosol number concentrations due to injections at different times rapidly converge before the transition onset. By varying the background aerosol concentration, we find that injected aerosols can significantly extend the persistence of stratocumulus decks by suppressing precipitation in clean environments but have little impact on stratocumulus breakup with higher background aerosol concentrations due to saturated aerosol effects. In clean MBLs, the SCT‐delay‐induced increase in cloud fraction dominates the overall cooling effects in response to aerosols, followed by Twomey effects. These cooling effects are slightly offset by decreased liquid water path (LWP) due to entrainment drying. In polluted MBLs, the Twomey effect is more dominant, followed by cloud fraction adjustments, and these coolings are also partly offset by LWP adjustments. All the simulations are made in relatively small domains in which injected aerosols are homogenized over a short time scale."

Using the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System FluxByCldTyp data set, this study investigates how temporal variations in total top‐of‐the‐atmosphere CREs are influenced by changes in the physical properties and fractional coverages of 42 individual cloud types and their broader categories over a 19‐year period. The analysis spans the tropical belt (25°S–25°N) and several convectively active regions, including the Tropical Western Pacific (TWP) and Africa. Our results show that variability in total CREs is primarily driven by changes in cloud fraction rather than microphysical properties. High clouds—particularly cirrostratus and deep convective clouds—exert strong negative correlations with shortwave CREs and strong positive correlations with longwave CREs, with correlation magnitudes reaching ±0.90 in the TWP. Low clouds, especially shallow cumulus, exhibit opposite correlations, partly due to obscuration by upper‐level clouds. While properties like total cloud water path, optical depth, and particle size influence cloud type‐mean CREs, their correlations with total CRE are relatively weak and largely due to co‐variability with total cloud amount. These correlations are generally more distinct and stronger within regional domains than across the tropical mean. Additionally, strong interrelationships are found among cloud categories, with high and low clouds often varying inversely. These results underscore the importance of cloud type‐specific contributions to radiative budget variability, providing observational benchmarks for climate model evaluation and cloud feedback studies."

 Changes in tropical cyclone (TC) frequency in a warming climate remain highly uncertain, with model simulations often yielding conflicting results. Here, through an analysis of 26 CMIP6 models under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, we project a decline in global TC frequency of 2–10% by the late 21st century. This decline is driven by an El Niño-like warming pattern, marked by amplified warming in the equatorial central-eastern Pacific, equatorial Atlantic, and North Indian Ocean. These non-uniform sea surface temperature (SST) trends weaken zonal SST gradients, suppressing the Walker circulation, and inducing Gill-type atmospheric responses to localized heating, in addition to an equatorward shift in the Intertropical Convergence Zone. These changes reduce upward motion across most basins, suppressing TC genesis. Additionally, radiative forcing reduces interhemispheric temperature contrasts, dampening the cross-equatorial Hadley circulation and further decreasing TC frequency, most notably in the South Indian Ocean. Our findings highlight the critical role of spatially heterogeneous SST warming in modulating TC activity and stress the need to reduce uncertainties in future SST projections. These insights advance the physical understanding of climate-driven TC projections and provide essential guidance for adaptation planning in vulnerable regions."

 Regional climate variability manifests through distinct atmospheric regimes influencing weather, climate, and predictability. Yet, their response to global warming remains unresolved. Using a hundred realisations from the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble, we examine shifts in wintertime North Atlantic atmospheric regimes and the North Atlantic Oscillation before and after 1995, highlighting the detectable influence of anthropogenic warming on atmospheric circulation. The large-ensemble framework isolates internal variability by removing the ensemble mean. Under anthropogenic warming, the number of regime states associated with the forced response remains constant, although their spatial circulation patterns undergo substantial reorganisation. In contrast, internal variability alone exhibits a reduction in the number of regime states. Future projections indicate a shift toward more frequent positive phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation, accompanied by low-amplitude negative phases late in the century, alongside a marked decline in its variability and altered mid-tropospheric westerlies.

 Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing provides an effective means of mapping near-surface air temperature (Ta) at large scales. However, cloud coverage introduces substantial data gaps, posing a considerable challenge for producing all-weather Ta datasets. This study proposed a two-step framework, termed Kernel-based Temporal Filling and Bias Correction (KTF-BC), to reconstruct all-weather remotely sensed Ta. In the first stage, a kernel-based temporal filling method was developed to estimate the theoretical clear-sky Ta for cloud-covered pixels. In the second stage, a bias correction model was constructed to adjust these theoretical estimates toward the actual Ta under cloudy conditions. The proposed framework was applied across China from 2019 to 2023 to generate spatially complete daily mean Ta at 1-km resolution. Validation against meteorological stations under cloudy conditions demonstrated consistently high accuracy, with R2 values up to 0.99, mean absolute errors (MAEs) ranging from 0.91 to 0.95 °C, root mean square errors (RMSEs) ranging from 1.21 to 1.26 °C, and biases close to 0 °C. The method effectively captured fine-scale thermal heterogeneity and demonstrated robust performance across varying cloud conditions and surface environments. This study provides a practical and reliable solution for reconstructing all-weather Ta from satellite observations."

 Detailed information on urban development types, e.g. residential, industrial, or transportation infrastructure, is essential for assessing urban growth rates, population dynamics, and environmental impacts. Earth observation imagery from Landsat and Sentinel-2 provides valuable data for characterizing urban areas and their development over large spatial extents and long temporal scales. However, mapping large areas over multiple decades poses several challenges. Specifically, the coarse resolution of historical Landsat data (30-m) limits the capacity to capture the spatial detail of diverse built-up types. Furthermore, existing mapping techniques—such as pixel-based, scene-based, and semantic segmentation - often face limitations in capturing spatial context, compromise mapping resolution, or rely on hand-crafted training data. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel workflow comprising two key components: (1) enhancing historical Landsat spatial resolution to 10-m using a generative super-resolution model, with a focus on synthetic images derived from spectral-temporal metrics, and (2) a “center-patch classification” method, wherein patch images serve as input for the central pixel classification. We applied the proposed methodologies to produce tri-annual maps of urban built-up classes—including Residential buildings, Industrial buildings, Open spaces, and Non built-up—across the Baltic Sea region for two decades (2000−2021). Evaluation of the baseline performance demonstrated that the 10-m maps derived from super-resolution Landsat data achieved higher accuracy than existing Sentinel-2-based products. Furthermore, when applied to earlier years within the study period, the super-resolution Landsat data consistently exhibited improved classification accuracy across all urban classes compared to native-resolution Landsat data."

 Climate change causes widespread increases in the frequency, magnitude, and extent of flood events, which pose increasing threats to societal and natural systems and highlight the urgency for timely and accurate flood mapping. However, previous flood mapping methods often require prior knowledge (such as the timing and location) of flood events that is usually incomplete or even unavailable when studying historical floods. Here we propose a new amplified deviation flood index (ADFI) using the time-series anomaly statistics from the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for mapping fully flooded areas without relying on prior knowledge of flood events. ADFI is constructed by considering two fundamentals of flood events: a decrease in backscatter intensity when ground objects are fully flooded and an increase in the variance of backscatter intensity owing to infrequently sudden occurrence of flood events, thus enabling a fast non-prior detection of flood events and extents. The performance of ADFI is assessed in four study areas across different climate zones of the globe, and the assessment shows that the overall accuracies of ADFI in all study areas exceed 93%, with precision >95% and recall >94%. Further comparison with two existing flood indices suggests that our proposed ADFI-based mapping method can improve the overall accuracy by 12.11%–3.97%, precision by 12.59%–10.17%, and recall by 54.32%–6.37%. A time-series flood mapping based on ADFI demonstrates that our proposed method enables a non-prior, precise, and fast detection of flood events and allows prompt monitoring of flood disasters. Our proposed approach enhances the efficiency and scalability of flood monitoring, providing a valuable tool for rapid disaster response and the reconstruction of long-term flood histories across diverse environments and climates."

 Mangroves are critical coastal ecosystems known for their carbon storage capacity, biodiversity, and role in shoreline stabilization. In Suriname, mangroves develop within a dynamic coastal setting shaped by migrating mudbanks and high sedimentation rates. This study examines how 30 structural metrics derived from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) vary across gradients of mangrove stand age and seaward distance. Forest stand age and yearly coastline positions were derived from Landsat time series data, enabling the integration of temporal and spatial drivers to uncover patterns of mangrove succession and structural development. Nonlinear growth models, more specifically the Chapman–Richards function, captured early growth and stabilization phases, while Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) provided flexibility to represent more complex structural changes observed in mature and decaying stands. Results show that structural metrics related to forest growth, such as canopy height and aboveground biomass density, increase rapidly during early successional stages but plateau beyond approximately 12 years or 2 km from the coastline. Complexity-oriented metrics, such as Foliage Height Diversity (FHD) and the Waveform Structural Complexity Index (WSCI), continue to evolve, reflecting increased vertical stratification in mature stands. By combining GEDI spaceborne LiDAR with Landsat-derived chronosequences, this study demonstrates how remote sensing can be used to monitor mangrove successional trajectories and structural complexity, including in inaccessible coastal regions. Our findings extend traditional mangrove successional models by quantifying how both temporal (age) and spatial (seaward distance) gradients jointly determine mangrove structure across the Surinamese coastline."

 Multi-source remote sensing data can highlight different types of information based on user needs, resulting in large volumes of data and significant challenges. Hardware and environmental constraints create mutual dependencies between information types, particularly between spatial data and other types, limiting the development of high-precision applications. Traditional methods are task-specific, leading to many algorithms without a unified solution, which greatly increases the computational and deployment costs of image fusion. In this paper, we summarize four remote sensing fusion tasks, including pan-sharpening, hyperspectral-multispectral fusion, spatio-temporal fusion, and polarimetric SAR fusion. By defining the spectral, temporal, and polarimetric information, as X, we propose the concept of generalized spatial-channel fusion, referred to as Spatial-X fusion. Then, we design an end-to-end network SpaXFus, a generalized spatial-channel fusion framework through a model-driven unfolding approach that exploits spatial-X intrinsic interactions to capture internal dependencies and self-interactions. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SpaXFus, e.g., SpaXFus can achieve four remote sensing image fusion tasks with superior performance (across all fusion tasks, spectral distortion decreases by 25.48 %, while spatial details improve by 7.5 %) and shows huge improvements across multiple types of downstream applications, including vegetation index generation, fine-grained image classification, change detection, and SAR vegetation extraction."

 Surface albedo plays a key role in forest–climate interactions by controlling the amount of solar radiation reflected back to the atmosphere. However, the effects of forest management practices, including total and partial disturbances, on these processes remain poorly understood, despite their importance for climate change mitigationThis study analyses how forest characteristics and disturbances influence the spatial and temporal dynamics of albedo during the growing season, through their effect on forest structure and cover. It also aims to highlight the importance of accounting for the influence of forest-related variables when predicting surface albedo. To achieve this objective, the apparent surface albedo was estimated over a 400  km2 humid boreal forest in eastern Canada using 22 snow-free Landsat 8 images from 2015 to 2021. Validation against observations from two flux towers yielded satisfactory results, with root mean square errors (RMSE) (0.013 ± 0.003 and 0.017 ± 0.004), and low biases (0.002 ± 0.005 and 0.004 ± 0.005) where the uncertainties correspond to 95% confidence intervals estimated by bootstrap resampling. Albedo estimates were then integrated into a random forest regression model along with predictors derived from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) and ecoforestry maps, including canopy metrics, forest disturbances, vegetation type and topographic derivatives. The model showed strong performance, with Kling-Gupta efficiencies (KGE) ranging from 0.85 (±0.0015) to 0.95 (±0.0006), RMSE from 0.005 to 0.013 (±0.00015) and mean absolute errors (MAE) ranging from 0.003 to 0.008 (±0.0001), demonstrating its robustness throughout the growing season. The average height of forest cover and the number of years since disturbances occurred were identified as key factors influencing albedo, demonstrating the importance of considering canopy structure and forest disturbance history when predicting surface albedo. This study underscores the critical importance of incorporating surface albedo considerations into forest management strategies aimed at optimizing climate regulation."

 Effective management of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in large, dense industrial complexes remains a critical challenge, as conventional monitoring methods are often too slow, limited in spatial coverage, and insufficiently resolved to pinpoint specific emission sources among thousands of facilities. This study introduces and validates a novel, multi-stage methodological framework which synergistically combines mobile Selected Ion Flow Tube Mass Spectrometry (SIFT-MS) with drone-based systems to enable rapid and precise source identification. The methodology begins with a wide-area mobile SIFT-MS survey, utilizing spatial statistics (Getis-Ord Gi∗) to identify hotspots, followed by targeted drone deployment for high-resolution aerial screening. This multi-stage approach successfully resolved distinct chemical signatures from adjacent sources that were not separable by ground-based monitoring alone. For instance, the framework differentiated a xylene- and ethylbenzene-rich profile near chemical manufacturing facilities, a MEK (methyl ethyl ketone)-rich profile near paint production, and a toluene- and acrolein-rich profile originating from a painting facility. The quantitative reliability of the drone-based sampling was validated through concurrent ground-level measurements, which demonstrated a high consistency in capturing the unique chemical signature at each location. This study demonstrates that the integrated mobile-drone framework provides a scientifically robust and efficient approach for characterizing industrial VOC emissions. By progressing from broad spatial screening to precise, evidence-based source identification, the methodology offers a powerful tool for targeted air quality management and has strong potential for application in highly complex industrial environments worldwide."

 Under global warming, extreme precipitation events (EPEs) have become frequent worldwide, with unclear microphysical differences in convective clouds. The weak and intense convection-induced EPEs (WeEPEs and InEPEs, respectively) over South China are identified with 10-year spaceborne dual-frequency precipitation radar observations. Results suggest that most EPEs occur in morning and nighttime. The distribution of WeEPEs (land-prevalent) and InEPEs (ocean-prevalent) is regulated by ocean thermal gradients, moisture transport, and orographic lifting. Weak sea surface temperature (SST) gradients and southerly moisture transport generate offshore moisture centers. The humid environment in the ocean may help the formation of WeEPEs. Conversely, strong SST gradients, coupled with stronger southerly moisture transport form inland moisture centers, with orographic forcing enhancing upward motion for strong convection. Weak convection generates extreme precipitation through synergistic increase in particle size and concentration below the 0 °C level, with high concentration being more critical. For oceanic events, InEPEs show a slightly larger particle diameter increase (0.11 mm) below the 0 °C level. However, WeEPEs have a much greater concentration increase (4.34 dB), resulting in a larger reflectivity factor increase (7.58 dBZ). For the most extreme precipitation, even if one of the warm-rain process and the ice-phase process dominates, the other still plays a significant role. Across eventsof different regions, continental WeEPEs reach peak rates through ice-particle melting (16.1 mm/h) and warm-rain coalescence to enhance particle size (70.6 mm/h); marine InEPEs (102.02 mm/h) rely on high liquid water path and efficient coalescence for maximum rates (warm-rain contribution: 43.3 mm/h)."

 The Taklimakan Desert is characterized by strong thermal forcing and a heterogeneous underlying surface, where sub-mesoscale motions and turbulence intermittency occur frequently and interfere with the accurate evaluation of land-atmosphere exchange fluxes. Based on a summer observation campaign at Tazhong Station, this study develops a spectra-based automatic classification algorithm that classifies the influence of sub-mesoscale motions and turbulence intermittency into four regimes. Regime 1, no intermittency and no influence of sub-mesoscale motions; Regime 2, large-scale intermittency with influence of sub-mesoscale motions; Regime 3, small-scale intermittency without influence of sub-mesoscale motions; and Regime 4, full-scale intermittency with influence of sub-mesoscale motions. The classification results show that Regimes 2 and 4, corresponding to large-scale and full-scale intermittency, occur most frequently. Large-scale intermittency can occur under almost any wind speed and stability conditions, but is stronger under nocturnal weak-wind stable conditions. Full-scale intermittency occurs predominantly under nocturnal weak winds or under near-neutral conditions with relatively strong winds during the day-night transition. For Regimes 2 and 4, empirical relationships are derived that relate large-scale and small-scale intermittency strengths to wind speed and wind shear, enabling automatic identification of turbulent intermittency. By removing sub-mesoscale motions, turbulent statistics are corrected for each regime and empirical correction schemes are proposed, which effectively improve estimates of turbulence intensity and counter-gradient transport in Regimes 2 and 4. These results deepen understanding of turbulent intermittency over the Taklimakan Desert and improve parameterizations of turbulent transport, with important implications for weather and climate predictions."

 Regional PM2.5 pollution frequently affects the Sichuan Basin in wintertime, posing significant risks to air quality and public health. In this study, six PM2.5 pollution events (2016–2019) were analyzed by utilizing hourly PM2.5 observations and reanalysis data to uncover the meteorological and topographic factors governing the accumulation and dissipation of these pollution events. During the accumulation phase, regional pollution developed in three patterns, with average increases in PM2.5 concentrations of 59.88%, 49.23% and 88.87%, respectively. In the dissipation phase, two patterns were identified, occurring in 25% and 75% of the cases, respectively. Based on weather classification, background circulation characteristics were identified, including pollution-prone types (Type1, Type2), types with dual-effect (Type3, Type6), and clean types (Type5). During the accumulation phase, variations in the upper-level northeastern cold vortex and subtropical high affected mid-level troughs and ridges, while deep basin topography and mountain ranges hindered vertical and horizontal pollutant dispersion, resulting in three distinct accumulation patterns. In the dissipation phase, plateau subsidence and northern cold fronts acted as primary clearing mechanisms, with cold air intrusion most effective for pollutant removal.

 Atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) structure over the Southern Ocean not only determines air-sea interactions but also influences local synoptic processes. However, due to the scarcity of observations, it has been rarely investigated. Here, based on the radiosonde observations conducted during the 37th Chinese Antarctic Scientific Expedition, the characteristics of the ABL structure over the Cosmonaut Sea and Bellinsgauzen Sea in the 2021 summer are revealed. The main findings are as follows: (1) The mean ABL height (ABLH) is lower in the ice-covered region than in the open water region, as enhanced radiative cooling and weakened sea-air heat exchange suppress the development of ABL. (2) The Thorpe method can well describe the vertical distribution of turbulent dissipation rate (ε) in ABL, and suggests that there is a noticeable difference in the vertical profile of ε between convective boundary layer and near-neutral boundary layer. (3) A case study of the most intense cyclone in January shows that the mean ABLH is higher during the cyclone period than during non-cyclone periods. Cold advection brought by the cyclone destabilizes stable stratification aloft, promoting the coupling of cloud and ABL. Concurrently, the cyclone-driven strong winds enhance low-level jets, intensify vertical shear, and thereby foster turbulent mixing. Together, these mechanisms strengthen turbulent activity and deepen the ABLH during the cyclone period."

 Supercells are among the most hazardous convective systems, frequently producing large hail, destructive winds, and severe socio-economic impacts. The enhancement of weather simulations is identified as a primary strategy to optimise short-term forecasting. The present study investigates the performance of two high-resolution configurations of the HARMONIE-AROME model during a severe supercell outbreak over eastern Iberia on 31st July 2015, when six confirmed supercells caused significant damage. The setups tested include a two-step one-way nested approach (2.5 km outer domain and 500 m inner domain), and a single-domain configuration at 500 m resolution. The model outputs, which include reflectivity, precipitation and temperature, are validated against OPERA radar composites and surface observations. At the same time, key convective parameters, derived from the Murcia sounding, are analyzed to assess the pre-convective environment. Although the simulations demonstrate a similar structure to the observed event, the two-domain nested simulation offers a slightly superior depiction of reflectivity and thermodynamic profiles. Nevertheless, precipitation analysis reveals that while nesting improves moderate rainfall representation, it introduces larger errors for the most extreme amounts, limiting its overall benefit. The obtained gain is not sufficient to offset the 30% higher computational cost when the two-domain nested approach is used. The single-domain non-nested configuration demonstrates a superior level of efficiency, exhibiting equivalent accuracy while exhibiting a diminished resource requirement."

Suresh Babu,Synergy between land-sea breeze dynamics and photochemistry governs the diurnal variability of primary and secondary organic aerosols in a tropical coastal atmosphere,"•Organic molecular markers at a coastal site in tropical India were characterized by GC/MS. •Phthalates and aromatics were predominant classes of OA among the quantified organics. •Land-sea breeze circulations and photochemistry impact the diurnal variability of OA. •Monoterpene-derived SOA is higher compared to isoprene-oxidation. •Plastic emissions through evaporation and/or combustion are major sources of OA. 
 Coastal tropical regions are ideal for studying sources and processes of organic aerosols (OA) due to their high humidity and solar radiation, with land- and sea-breeze circulations influencing OA transport. However, their molecular characteristics in these areas are not well understood. This study analysed PM10 samples from Thumba (8.5°N, 76.9°E, approximately 3 m above sea level, a coastal location in tropical India), collected on day and night basis during the pre-monsoon period, detecting various classes of organic molecular markers including biomass-burning, biological, aromatic compounds, phthalates, and biogenic secondary organic compounds using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Results showed that total quantified organic compounds were twice as abundant during the daytime, indicating that photochemical processes are the primary sources. Phthalates and aromatics were the dominant compounds throughout the sampling period. This suggests that OA production primarily results from plastic evaporation during the day, while municipal solid waste burning occurs mostly at night, as confirmed by higher daytime phthalate emissions and nighttime terephthalic acid emissions (a tracer of plastic combustion). The presence of primary sugars and sugar alcohols during the day implies that plant emissions (pollen, spores) are significant sources of primary OA. In contrast, nighttime hydroxy and polyacids indicate secondary OA formation associated with anthropogenic emissions. Furthermore, monoterpene-derived secondary organic products were more prevalent than those from isoprene, especially during daylight hours. OA particles from biomass burning were minimal, as evidenced by lower levels of anhydrosugars and lignin/resin products. Overall, the present study highlights that the photochemical degradation of phthalates and the burning of municipal solid waste containing plastics are significant sources of OA at Thumba during the pre-monsoon, with land-sea breeze transport and photodegradation/evaporation influencing their diurnal variation. The prominence of phthalates and aromatics highlight the importance of understanding airborne nanoplastics and their climate effects in tropical coastal atmospheres."

 Vertical profiles of pollen and biomass burning particles were obtained at the MeteoSwiss station of Payerne (Switzerland) using a novel multi-channel elastic-fluorescence lidar combined with in situ measurements during the spring 2023 wildfires and pollination season during the PERICLES (PayernE lidaR and Insitu detection of fluorescent bioaerosol and dust partiCLES and their cloud impacts) campaign. This original approach provided, for the first time in this region, reliable information on pollen speciation aloft, bridging the gap between ground-based sampling and remote sensing observations. Pollen particles were detected near ground (up to 2 km height), showing strong fluorescence backscatter coefficients (bF) (up to 8×10-4 Mm−1 sr−1). Smoke plumes from Canada and Germany were detected at higher altitudes (3–5 km) with lower bF values compared to those from pollen particles near ground. In situ measurements and in vivo fluorescence spectra were used to classify pollen particles near ground. Ice nucleating particle (INP) concentrations relevant for mixed-phase clouds were enhanced at warm temperatures, characteristic of the contribution of biological particles to the INP population. This was further supported by the correlation between INPs at −14 °C and fluorescent bioaerosol particles detected by the Wideband Integrated Bioaerosol Sensor, while INPs at −20 °C were more strongly linked to coarse-mode dust. Comparison of bF values from two European Laser Induced Fluorescence lidar stations revealed that aged air masses containing smoke particles exhibited ∼ 50 % lower fluorescence during long-range transport in the free troposphere, possibly due to photochemical aging, mixing with non-fluorescent particles and dispersion."

These models show large discrepancies in simulating the interannual variability of historical dust emissions, as well as the relative importance of wind speed versus hydroclimate drivers. This study underscores the need to improve near-surface wind simulations in hyperarid areas and land surface process representations in arid and semiarid areas to reduce dust emission uncertainties. 
 Windblown dust emissions are controlled by near-surface wind speed and sediment erodibility, the latter modulated by hydroclimate and land-use conditions. Accurate representations of these drivers are critical for reproducing historical dust variability and projecting future dust changes in Earth system models (ESMs). This study examines the discrepancies among 21 ESMs in the relative importance of wind speed versus five hydroclimate drivers in explaining the historical (1980–2014) variability of dust emissions from global drylands. In hyperarid areas, models show poor agreement in the simulated dust variability, with only 9 % out of 210 inter-model comparisons exhibiting significant positive correlations. In contrast, arid and semiarid areas exhibit a dual pattern driven by a “double-edged sword” effect of land surface memory: models with coherent hydroclimate variability show better agreement, whereas those with divergent hydroclimate representations show larger disagreement. While the ESMs capture the dominant role of wind speed in hyperarid areas, they diverge markedly in the relative contributions of wind and hydroclimate drivers in arid and semiarid areas. Replacing the Zender et al. (2003) dust scheme with the Kok et al. (2014) scheme in CESM and E3SM generally strengthens hydroclimate influences while reducing wind speed contributions to simulated dust variability. MERRA-2 reanalysis produces stronger wind influences than most ESMs across all dryland regions. These results underscore the need for improved near-surface wind simulations in hyperarid areas and more realistic land surface and hydroclimate representations in arid and semiarid areas to reduce uncertainties in global dust emission simulations."

Pye;Jingyi Li;Linghan Zeng;Song Guo;Min Hu;Jianlin Hu,Evaluating simulations of organic aerosol volatility and degree of oxygenation in eastern China,"We evaluated how well a widely used air quality model simulates key properties of organic particles in the atmosphere, such as volatility and oxygen content, which influence how particles age, spread, and affect both air quality and climate. Using observations in eastern China, we found the model underestimated particle mass and misrepresented their properties. Our results highlight the need for improved emissions and chemical treatments to better predict air quality and climate impacts. 
 Volatility and oxygen-to-carbon (O/C) molar ratios are critical properties of organic aerosols (OA), influencing their viscosity, hygroscopicity, and light absorption thereby resulting in impacts on air quality and climate. While atmospheric models often track these properties to simulate OA evolution, their performance remains insufficiently evaluated. This study assessed OA volatility and O/C simulations by comparing CMAQ model outputs using official AERO7i and community-contributed two-dimensional volatility basis set (2D-VBS) schemes, against two field measurements in eastern China. Apart from baseline modelling, two additional simulations using AERO7i incrementally incorporated low-volatility/semi-volatile/intermediate-volatility organic compound (L/S/IVOC) emissions and enhanced anthropogenic secondary organic aerosol (SOA) yields. An optimized 2D-VBS simulation further constrained O/C ratios of primary organic aerosol (POA) emissions using observations. The results showed that OA mass concentrations were underestimated by 24 % in 2D-VBS and 27 %–34 % with updated AERO7i, likely due to underrepresented vehicular POA emissions and nighttime SOA formation. All simulations captured the substantial contribution of low-volatility products (C*<0.1 µg m−3) but failed to reproduce the detailed volatility distributions within this range. Simulated O/C ratios were biased low in aged air masses (notably with 2D-VBS) and slightly overestimated in areas with more local emissions using updated AERO7i. Misrepresentations of OA volatility significantly led to biases in viscosity predictions, while the hygroscopicity parameter played a more important role. These findings highlight the need to better constrain OA volatility and O/C in models to improve projections of OA air quality and climate impacts."

We demonstrate that a graph-based approach – leveraging spatial information from sensor networks – can significantly enhance Ta forecasting at individual locations. Furthermore, we introduce an automated framework to streamline graph construction and model implementation. This study also demonstrates the distinct spatiotemporal dynamics of intra-city Ta patterns. 
 Air temperature (Ta) has critical implications for various socioeconomic sectors, yet its dynamics are particularly complex in urban areas due to heterogeneous built environments, landscapes, and diverse anthropogenic activities. Physics-based models struggle with intra-city Ta forecasts due to inadequate urban representation and limited spatial resolution. While weather observation networks offer promising alternatives for direct modeling with local Ta time-series, an effective framework to leverage these intra-city discrete sensor data remains lacking. Here, we demonstrate that graph neural networks (GNNs) can harness observation network information to refine Ta prediction at individual locations and elucidate underlying mechanisms. Our novel Mix-n-Scale framework with GNNs achieves over 12 % improvement in short-term Ta forecasts compared to conventional local time-series approaches. Further model evaluation disentangles performance variations with local Ta variability in diverse spatiotemporal contexts, indicating distinct patterns of intra-city heterogeneity across seasonal and diurnal scales. Our findings establish graph-based approaches for leveraging proliferating urban sensor data and advancing understanding of Ta spatiotemporal dynamics in complex urban environments."

We found that unusual sea surface warming patterns in the midlatitude Indian Ocean can disrupt winds and temperatures in the middle atmosphere, including the stratosphere and mesosphere, of the Southern Hemisphere. These disturbances alter ozone and air movement and may affect polar climate. Our results highlight the need to include Indian Ocean variability in climate models for better predictions. 
 An index representing the midlatitude Indian Ocean Dipole (MIOD) is  derived from the second empirical orthogonal function (EOF) mode of  austral winter (JJA) sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies to examine its impact on the Southern Hemisphere middle and upper atmosphere. ERA5 reanalysis datasets, together with satellite observations and WACCM6 simulations, are used to analyze the associated atmospheric responses to MIOD. The results show pronounced but asymmetric impacts between positive and negative events, primarily driven by differences in wavenumber-1 planetary wave activity. Positive MIOD events enhance planetary-wave  propagation from the Indian Ocean sector, leading to momentum deposition, variations in temperature, zonal winds, as well as a strengthening of the residual meridional circulation. These dynamical anomalies warm the midlatitudes and modify the vortex's vertical–meridional structure. Changes in stratospheric winds further regulate gravity-wave filtering, providing a pathway for SST signals to extend upward into the mesosphere. In contrast, negative events generally produce weaker and less statistically robust signals. These results identify Indian Ocean SST variability as an additional driver of large-scale atmospheric variability and reveal a previously underappreciated pathway through which the Indian Ocean can influence the middle and upper atmosphere at interannual timescales."

Gaston,Transported African Dust in the Lower Marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer is Internally Mixed with Sea Salt Contributing to Increased Hygroscopicity and a Lower Lidar Depolarization Ratio,"Coordinated observations from MAGPIE 2023 show that Saharan dust in the marine atmospheric boundary layer becomes internally mixed with sea spray. This mixing increases particle sphericity and hygroscopicity, likely leading to suppressed lidar linear depolarization ratios despite high dust concentrations. The findings have key implications for interpreting lidar-derived dust retrievals, estimating surface dust from satellite products, and improving dust representation in models. 
 Saharan dust is frequently transported across the Atlantic, yet the chemical, physical, and morphological transformations dust undergoes within the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) remain poorly understood. These transformations are critical for understanding dust's radiative and geochemical impacts, it's representation in atmospheric models, and detection via remote sensing. Here, we present coordinated observations from the Office of Naval Research's Moisture and Aerosol Gradients/Physics of Inversion Evolution (MAGPIE) August 2023 campaign at Ragged Point, Barbados. These include vertically resolved single-particle analyses, mass concentrations of dust and sea spray, and High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) retrievals. Single-particle data show that dust within the Saharan Air Layer (SAL) remains externally mixed, with a corresponding high HSRL-derived linear depolarization ratio (LDR) at 532 nm of ∼ 0.3. However, at lower altitudes, dust becomes internally mixed with sea spray, and under the high humidity (>80 %) of the MABL undergoes hygroscopic growth, yielding more spherical particles, suppressing the LDR to <0.1; even in the presence of high dust loadings (e.g., ∼ 120 µg m−3). This low depolarization in the MABL is likely due to a combination of the differences between the single scattering properties of dust and spherical particles, and the potential modification of the dust optical properties from an increased hygroscopicity of dust caused by the mixing with sea salt in the humid MABL. These results highlight the importance of the aerosol particle mixing state when interpreting LDR-derived dust retrievals and estimating surface dust concentrations in satellite products and atmospheric models."

The model matched many observed patterns but showed nighttime and background errors. We identified the main human and natural sources and sinks, offering insights to improve future greenhouse gas monitoring and climate modelling. 
 Understanding the variability and sources of atmospheric CO2 is essential for improving greenhouse gas monitoring and model performance. This study investigates temporal CO2 variability at the Xianghe site in China, which hosts both remote sensed (TCCON-affiliated) and in situ (PICARRO) observations. Using the Weather Research and Forecast model coupled with Chemistry, in its greenhouse gas option (WRF-GHG), we performed a one-year simulation of surface and column-averaged CO2 mole fractions, evaluated model performance and conducted sensitivity experiments to assess the influence of key model configuration choices. The model captured the temporal variability of column-averaged mole fraction of CO2 (XCO2) reasonably well (r=0.7), although a persistent bias in background values was found. A July 2019 heatwave case study further demonstrated the model’s ability to reproduce a synoptically driven anomaly. Near the surface, performance was good during afternoon hours (r=0.75, MBE =2.44 ppm), nighttime mole fractions were overestimated (MBE = 7.86 ppm), resulting in an exaggerated diurnal amplitude. Sensitivity tests revealed that land cover data, vertical emission profiles, and adjusted VPRM-parameters (Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model) can significantly influence modeled mole fractions, particularly at night. Tracer analysis identified industry and energy as dominant sources, while biospheric fluxes introduced seasonal variability – acting as a moderate sink in summer for XCO2 and a net source in most months near the surface. These findings demonstrate the utility of WRF-GHG for interpreting temporal patterns and sectoral contributions to CO2 variability at Xianghe, while emphasizing the importance of careful model configuration to ensure reliable simulations."

Focusing on six days with potential contrails over Europe, we show that these clouds cause daytime cooling and nighttime warming. Validation through various comparisons shows that our approach provides accurate estimates of contrail radiative forcing. 
 Contrails, anthropogenic ice clouds formed by aircraft at cruise altitudes, strongly influence the Earth’s radiation budget but the measurement of their radiative forcing (RF) remains poorly quantified at high temporal resolution. In this study, we present the Rapid Contrail-RF Estimation Approach, which uses geostationary satellite observations to estimate the radiative forcing of high-altitude ice clouds, including potential contrail cirrus clouds. Starting from a cloud retrieval product, we apply pre-computed Look-Up Tables (LUTs) to generate radiative forcing maps for high-altitude ice clouds. Specifically, observations from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) onboard Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) were used to visually identify days with potential contrails. For 6 selected days, ice clouds were characterized using the Optimal Cloud Analysis (OCA) product from MSG/SEVIRI data provided by the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT). The LUTs were constructed using the libRadtran radiative transfer model to quantify the radiative effect of ice clouds in the short-wave (SW) and long-wave (LW) spectral regions. A cloud top pressure filter was applied to isolate high-altitude ice clouds, including potential contrails. The resulting data set provides a quantification of SW, LW, and net radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere due to potential contrails. We show that these clouds contribute to daytime cooling and nighttime warming, with a net effect that varies between diurnal cycles. We assess the validity of the Rapid Contrail-RF Estimation Approach through correlation exercises focusing on uncertainties in the use of LUTs, a single ice cloud parameterization, and a calculated cloud top height, supplemented by comparisons with polar orbiting satellite observations from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments. In general, these correlative comparisons indicate that the proposed approach provides accurate data on the estimation of the radiative forcing of high-altitude ice clouds, including potential contrails, with an accuracy of approximately 15 %."

Observing a record convective  rainfall with national and local monitoring  networks and opportunistic sensors,"Extreme rainfall can cause severe damage, especially in cities. However, national meteorological institutes have difficulties to observe such events. In this study we show that rainfall observations collected by local actors, such as municipalities and even citizens, can contribute to better rainfall observations. Sweden’s official monitoring network could not capture the event under study, whereas the complementary sensors contributed to a better understanding of the magnitude of the event. 
 Short-duration extreme rainfall can cause severe impacts in built environments and flood mitigation measures require high-resolution rainfall data to be effective. It is a particular challenge to observe convective storms, which are expected to intensify with climate change. However, rainfall monitoring networks operated by national meteorological and hydrological services generally have limited ability to observe rainfall at sub-hourly and sub-kilometer scales. This paper investigates the capability of second- and third-party rainfall sensors to observe a highly localized convective storm that hit southwestern Sweden in August 2022. Specifically, we compared the observations from professional weather stations, C-band radar, X-band radar, Commercial Microwave Links and Personal Weather Stations to get a full impression of the sensors' strengths and weaknesses in the context of convective storms. The results suggest that second- and third-party networks can contribute important information on short-duration extreme rainfall to national weather services. The second-party network assisted in quantifying the magnitude and spatial variability of the event with high accuracy. The third-party network could contribute to the understanding of the duration and spatial distribution of the storm, but it underestimated the magnitude compared with the reference sensors."

 The TRANSAMA campaign (Transit to AMARYLLIS-AMAGAS oceanographic cruise), conducted aboard the research vessel Marion Dufresne II assessed instrument performance and investigated aerosol properties during its transit from La Reunion Island to Barbados (April–May 2023). A set of remote sensing instruments, including two CE318-T Sun-sky-lunar photometers and a CE370 single-wavelength elastic lidar, was deployed under the MAP-IO (Marion Dufresne Atmospheric Program–Indian Ocean) framework. Performance assessments of the deployed instrumentation support the development of coupled lidar–photometer systems for shipborne atmospheric observations, while acknowledging current detection limits. Synergistic observations provided vertically resolved aerosol properties, such as extinction coefficients, alongside atmospheric structure, highlighting the marine boundary layer (MBL) top at 800 ± 300 m. While the photometer observations revealed clean atmospheric conditions over the South Atlantic (AOD440=0.08±0.04), thin aerosol layers above the MBL were identified as long-range transported residual biomass-burning-urban aerosols from Southern Africa with effective LR of 33±12 sr. Cloud layers covering a large range of altitudes (up to 16 km) were observed in 53 % of the lidar profiles, with a higher frequency at lower altitudes, where aerosol layers were more frequently detected. These findings emphasize the impact of continental aerosols on remote oceanic regions and demonstrate the capabilities of synergistic lidar–photometer measurements for advancing our understanding of aerosol variability, cloud formation, and climate processes over the oceans."

To detect such changes, and to monitor the health of the ozone layer, long term global observations are needed. The OMPS Limb Profiler (LP) series of satellite sensors are designed to meet this need. We validate the latest version OMPS LP ozone profiles against other satellite and ground based measurements. We find that OMPS LP ozone is consistent with other data sources and is suitable for use in ozone trend studies. 
 The Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite Limb Profiler (OMPS LP) was launched onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite in 2011 and began routine science operations in April 2012. The OMPS LP uses measurements of scattered solar radiation in the ultraviolet, visible and near infrared wavelengths to retrieve high vertical resolution profiles of ozone from 12 km (or cloud tops) up to 57 km. In mid-2023, version 2.6 of the OMPS LP ozone profile retrievals was released, featuring improvements in calibration, retrieval algorithm, and data quality. We evaluate OMPS LP version 2.6 ozone retrievals using correlative data from other satellite instruments and ground based data for the period April 2012 to April 2024. Our results show agreement between OMPS LP and all correlative data sources between 20 and 50 km at all latitudes with differences of less than 10 %, with OMPS generally exhibiting a negative bias, except between 32 and 38 km in the tropics and southern mid-latitudes, where the bias is positive. In the tropics and southern mid-latitudes the differences between OMPS LP and MLS, and OMPS LP and SAGE III/ISS are less than ±5 % between 20 and 45 km. Above 50 km, the agreement with MLS is still on the order of −5 % or better. Larger positive biases, up to ∼ 35 %, are seen in the upper troposphere lower stratosphere layer (∼ 15 to 20 km) between approximately 40° S and 40° N. We find that OMPS version 2.6 ozone exhibits the same seasonal cycle as compared to all correlative measurement sources and our analysis shows that there is no significant seasonal bias in OMPS LP. We find drifts relative to correlative observations at all latitude bands of less than ±2 % per decade (±1 % per decade) between 25 and 50 km for the 2012–2024 period, with larger drifts above 50 km and below 20 km. These drifts vary between correlative measurements and straddle the zero line, we therefore conclude that there is no significant systematic drift in OMPS LP version 2.6 ozone for the period 2012 to 2024. The drift results represent an improvement in the long term stability of version 2.6 ozone over that of version 2.5."

We demonstrate PrecipBE's utilization with a brief 30-year trend analysis of ARM Southern Great Plains (SGP) site data, suggesting shorter, less intense events, but rising annual rainfall, driven by rare extremes. 
 Surface precipitation measurements are essential for Earth system model (ESM) evaluation and understanding cloud processes. An ever-growing need for robust, temporally evolving, and easy-to-use statistical datasets provides motivation for a baseline ground-based precipitation properties data product. The U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) user facility operates an extensive suite of precipitation instruments with various sensitivities and operating mechanisms, which render the decision of which instrument to use based on one or more fixed thresholds challenging and prone to errors and bias. Using a long-term instrument inter-comparison from a unique per-precipitation event perspective, rather than instantaneous sample comparison, we demonstrate that ARM rainfall-measuring instruments are generally consistent with each other at the statistical level. Inter-instrument deviations at the single event level can be large, especially for specific rainfall event properties such as maximum precipitation rates. A machine-learning (ML) analysis using a random forest regressor indicates that in some cases, depending on instrument, local site climatology, and/or specific deployment configuration, certain atmospheric state variables influence the measured quantities in an unpredictable manner. Thus, a-priori weighting of different instruments does not necessarily lead to more accurate and less biased synthesis of instrument data. These results motivate the design of the ARM precipitation best-estimate (PrecipBE) value-added product, which incorporates all valid precipitation data while considering data quality and other instrument limitations.PrecipBE consists of time series and tabular statistics datasets in an easy-to-use and insightful per-precipitation event format. It provides a large set of precipitation event properties supplemented with ancillary data from ARM datasets that correspond to the detected precipitation events. We describe the PrecipBE algorithm and demonstrate its use via the examination of a single-day output as well as a long-term trend analysis of precipitation events at the ARM Southern Great Plains (SGP) site, covering more than 30 years of data. The trend analysis tentatively suggests a long-term temporal tendency for mainly shorter and less intense precipitation events at the SGP site, but a long-term increase in annual rainfall by more than 36 mm (5 %) per decade. This rainfall trend is catalyzed primarily by more extreme event properties of relatively rare, intense precipitation events, with event total and 1 min maximum precipitation rate at a 1 year timeframe increasing up to 5 mm and 9 mm h−1 (several percent) per decade, respectively. While the currently available PrecipBE datasets (at https://adc.arm.gov/discovery/, last access:  8 December 2025) cover rainfall from multiple ARM deployments up to March 2025, PrecipBE is planned to be expanded to include solid-phase precipitation and will soon become an operational product with a several-day lag from real-time. We invite the ARM user community to leverage this new product and welcome user feedback to further enhance the dataset."

This method can identify the composition of these aerosols faster and more accurately. We tested it using ground-based data. Our results show that this method can help monitor air quality and better understand the impact of aerosols on the climate. 
 Accurate aerosol composition retrievals support radiative forcing assessment, source attribution, air quality analysis, and improved modeling of aerosol–cloud–radiation interactions. Aerosol retrievals based solely on visible-wavelength aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations provide limited spectral sensitivity, which may be insufficient to reliably distinguish among aerosol types with similar optical properties. In this study, we present a new retrieval framework that combines multi-wavelength AOD observations from both the visible and shortwave infrared spectrum, enhancing aerosol type discrimination. A neural network forward model trained on simulations from the Model for Optical Properties of Aerosols and Clouds (MOPSMAP), which relates aerosol optical properties to spectral AOD, is embedded in an optimal estimation method (OEM) to retrieve aerosol composition. This machine learning-based forward model achieves computational efficiency without making compromises in accuracy. The neural network forward model achieves a mean R2 of 0.99 with root-mean-square error below 0.01. The retrieval resolves up to four independent aerosol components, with degrees of freedom for signal about 3.75. We apply this hybrid method to ground-based observations, including data from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and Fourier Transform Infrared spectrometer (FTIR) measurements. The retrieved aerosol compositions are consistent with physical expectations and validated through backward trajectory analysis."

We used the MultiVI algorithm, which employs satellite images from various angles to enhance accuracy. Our method outperformed traditional statistical methods compared to field measurements, enabling precise large-scale mapping of vegetation cover for improved environmental monitoring and planning. 
 Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) is an important vegetation structure factor for applications in agriculture, forestry, ecology, etc. Due to its simplicity, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based mixture model is widely used to estimate FVC from remotely sensed data. However, the accuracy and efficiency of FVC estimation require the precise calculation of two key parameters: the NDVI of fully covered vegetation and bare soil. Despite their importance, these two endmember NDVI values have not yet been produced as large-scale maps. Traditional statistical methods for obtaining endmember NDVI from satellite datasets highly rely on the assumption that a certain amount of pure pixels of vegetation and soil must be present, which is often invalid for many areas. This study generated 30 m resolution maps of endmember NDVI across China using the MultiVI algorithm, incorporating multi-angle remote sensing data. The quality and accuracy of the endmember NDVI maps were evaluated using various validation data, including statistically obtained pure NDVI, soil spectra from a soil library, and field-measured FVC. The NDVI values for bare soil derived from the MultiVI algorithm were consistent with those obtained from the soil spectral library. Additionally, the FVC estimated using the MultiVI-derived endmember NDVI and the VI-based mixture model exhibited reasonable accuracy compared to the field measurements. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) values for MultiVI FVC were below 0.13 in the Heihe, Hebei, and Three Gorges Reservoir regions of China. These regions include typical arid and humid zones, facilitating the evaluation of the algorithm's performance under diverse climatic conditions. Furthermore, the MultiVI FVC outperformed those calculated using the traditional statistical methods. The endmember NDVI maps provide a convenient and reliable source of key parameters for the accurate and rapid estimation of FVC at large scales.

Shutler,Decadal and spatially complete global surface chlorophyll-a data record from satellite and BGC-Argo observations,"Chlorophyll a is routinely monitored using ocean colour satellites, however, these data records have gaps. Here we present a methodology to provide a spatially and temporally complete chlorophyll-a record, using Biogeochemical Argo floats as a constraint on wintertime chlorophyll-a, and a statistical kriging approach to fill cloud gaps. Thereby, providing a complete record at monthly 0.25° resolution between 1997 and 2024, consistent to the underlying climate data record. 
 Decadal-scale satellite-based climate data records of chlorophyll-a (chl-a), an essential climate variable, are now readily available at high accuracy and precision. These data are being extensively used for research and, increasingly, for operational services. However, these observations rely on availability of sunlight and the satellite sensor being able to view the ocean, so there are gaps in data due to the presence of clouds and more widely during the polar winter. This is an issue when spatially complete data are needed for global climate studies, or as inputs to machine learning methods and for data assimilation. Whilst addressing cloud cover is well studied, methodologies to overcome missing data due to the polar winter has received little attention and simple approaches to overcome these gaps can lead to unrealistic values. Biogeochemical Argo (BGC-Argo) floats have widely been deployed, and they represent an opportunity to address these gaps. We present an approach that combines BGC-Argo data and a satellite chl-a climate data record to produce a spatially and temporally complete, global monthly chl-a record between 1997–2024 at 0.25° spatial resolution. Clouds gaps were filled using an established spatial kriging approach. Polar wintertime chl-a were reconstructed using relative changes between the wintertime BGC-Argo chl-a, and the previous autumntime or next springtime satellite observations, for individual hemispheres. Uncertainties were calculated on a per-pixel basis to retain the underlying uncertainty fields in the climate data record and were modified to account for the uncertainties related to the gap filling. The seasonal cycles in the resulting polar data are consistent with light availability. Clear interannual and inter-hemisphere variability in the wintertime chl-a were observed. Independent assessment of solely the gap filled wintertime chl-a estimates against in situ data (N=201 total) indicates that the accuracy and precision of the underlying satellite data, a key component of a climate data record, are maintained. The 26 year global and spatially complete chl-a data, that are consistent with the underlying climate data record can be downloaded from Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15689006, Ford et al., 2025b)."

Due to complex physical and optical properties, BC remains poorly constrained. We combined satellite observations with physical models to build a daily, high-resolution, decadal global dataset of BC mass, number, size, and mixing details. The data contains both known sources and new hotspots. These results can support climate models, satellite products, and pollution mitigation. 
 Black carbon, a major absorbing component of atmospheric aerosols, plays an important role in climate regulation, air quality, and human health, yet its column concentration and microphysical properties at regional and global scales remains highly uncertain. In this study, we implement an integrated approach that combines multi-angle, multi-band observations from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) with a Mie scattering framework to estimate black carbon column properties including size and mixing state globally on a daily basis. By constraining particle size distributions with absorption aerosol optical depth and single scattering albedo across all four bands, the method simultaneously retrieves number and mass concentrations. Long-term simulations from 2005 to 2020 reveal distinct spatial and temporal patterns, with particularly high levels over biomass burning regions in Africa and South America as well as industrial and urban centers in Asia. Comparisons with ground-based sun photometer measurements and reanalysis data confirm the robustness and accuracy of the estimates. The resulting dataset provides a consistent global record of black carbon column concentrations, offering valuable support for constraining climate models, improving assessments of aerosol radiative forcing, and informing targeted mitigation strategies.

They impact the amount of solar energy entering the sea ice-ocean system. We describe the retrieval method of a new data set of the daily melt-pond coverage on Arctic sea ice north of 60 degrees latitude North for June to August of years 2000 to 2024 based on satellite remote sensing. The results of the quality assessment against independent observations demonstrate the data set’s credibility and usefulness for Arctic climate system studies. 
 We report on a novel data set of the melt-pond fraction on Arctic sea ice. Melt ponds on Arctic sea ice are an important phenomenon of the summer-melt process. They reduce the surface albedo of sea ice substantially, by that influence the net shortwave radiation balance, and with that the amount of solar radiation energy that is received by the sea ice-ocean system in the Arctic during summer. This has also implications for under-ice biogeochemical processes and ice mechanics. Melt ponds have been observed by a number of satellite sensors, mostly in the optical and near-infrared wavelength range. Here we present an updated version of a spectral un-mixing approach published earlier that led to a data set of melt-pond fraction on Arctic sea ice with 8-daily sampling for months May through August from 2000 through 2011. The approach is based on reflectance measurements of channels 1, 3 and 4 of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS on board the Earth Observation Satellite (EOS) Terra satellite. We modified the approach and derived the daily melt-pond fraction on Arctic sea ice at 500 m and at 12.5 km grid resolution for months June through August from 2000 through 2024 from MODIS v6.1 observations. In addition, we provide the net ice surface fraction – aka the fraction of sea ice without melt ponds – and the fraction of open water between the ice floes. Our MODIS melt-pond fraction agrees within -3 % to +4 % with independent estimates of the melt-pond fraction from very-high resolution optical satellite imagery and from Operation Ice Bridge Digital Camera System imagery. The MODIS open-water fraction we find to be too small by 2 % to 6 %; the net ice-surface fraction tends to be too large by 2 % to 9 %. The 12.5 km gridded product shows a slightly worse (by 1 %) agreement. While our 12.5 km gridded MODIS product under-estimates the melt-pond fraction from very-high resolution optical satellite imagery by about 2 % in the mean (median: 3 %), the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) product over-estimates these independent estimates by about 8 % (median: 9 %). Our MODIS melt-pond fraction data set is available from Sadikni and Kern (2025): https://doi.org/10.25592/uhhfdm.18069."

Using satellite images, we tracked when and how often rice was grown and confirmed the results with thousands of field samples. The maps closely match national statistics and offer a valuable resource for understanding food production, water use, and climate impacts in this vital region. 
 South and Southeast Asia, a major global hub for paddy rice cultivation, exhibits the highest rice cropping intensity worldwide due to its favourable hydrothermal conditions, and also has experienced considerable spatiotemporal changes due to climate change and anthropogenic activities. However, the absence of long-term spatial distribution and cropping intensity of paddy rice hinders effective agricultural and environmental management. This gap is particularly critical especially in the 21st century, with enhanced impacts from changing climate, water resources, and food trade pattern. Using all the available Landsat and Sentinel-2 archives, we refined a phenology-based algorithm to generate 30-m rice maps and cropping intensity across South and Southeast Asia for the years 1995, 2005, 2015, and 2024. The algorithm overcomes the challenge of detecting rice cropping intensity in long time-series and comprises three core steps: (1) identifying pixel-level rice phenological peaks using an enhanced peak detection method, thereby defining potential transplanting windows and minimizing monsoon-induced cloud and precipitation interference; (2) detecting paddy flooding signals and delineating rice cultivation areas based on phenological rules derived from the relationship between the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI); (3) determining rice cropping intensity according to the number of valid crop peaks and associated flooding signals within a single year. The resulting maps were validated using 23,396 samples collectively derived from a field photo library, visual interpretation of Sentinel-1/2 satellite imagery, and a sample migration algorithm. Across the four periods, the maps achieved overall accuracies ranging from 83 % to 87 %. In addition, the resultant products were compared with existing regional and period-specific rice datasets (e.g., NESEA-RICE10 and Open-SEA-Rice-10) for further evaluation. The comparisons demonstrated that the refined approach achieved higher accuracy and robustness in mapping both rice distribution and cropping intensity, whereas the existing products performed well only in partial environments. When compared with the FAO official statistics for South and mainland Southeast Asian countries, the derived maps yielded R² values exceeding 0.9. This dataset holds great potential for applications such as methane emission estimation, water resource management, and crop yield monitoring, thereby supporting sustainable agricultural practices and policy development in the region."

To better project their future evolution, we measured the ice thickness of the four glaciers using radio-echo sounding and mapped the bed topography beneath the ice. These maps provide essential insights into future landscapes, ecosystems, and policymaking. 
 Sweden currently hosts 270 glaciers, four of which belong to the 61 reference glaciers monitored worldwide. Eight Swedish glaciers disappeared during the warm summer of 2024, and under the global warming scenario associated with current climate policies, all four Swedish reference glaciers (Mårmaglaciären, Storglaciären, Rabots glaciär, and Riukojietna) are projected to vanish within this century. Such change will have implications for people, ecosystems, infrastructure, and local meteorological processes, highlighting the need to better constrain the resultant emerging post-glacial landscapes. During 2024–2025, we conducted radio-echo sounding (RES) surveys on the four Swedish reference glaciers and obtained a total of 40470 ice thickness point measurements. The mean and maximum measured ice thicknesses are 97 and 242 m for Mårmaglaciären, 88 and 225 m for Storglaciären, 85 and 158 m for Rabots glaciär, and 32 and 87 m for Riukojietna. The corresponding mean ice-thickness uncertainties are 12.0, 12.4, 11.4, and 7.5 m, respectively.

Analysis was restricted to days over specific PM2.5 concentration thresholds (3 and 5 μg/m3). Nonmovers during pregnancy (75% of cohort) were assessed in sensitivity analyses. There were 3356 autism diagnoses by age 5. Autism risk was associated with increased number of wildfire-exposed days during the third trimester and was strongest for nonmovers.

While seasonal variation in metal concentrations has been observed in this species, little is known about how other contaminant groups, such as per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), vary with season. In the present study, we report concentrations of total mercury (THg), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and 13 PFAS in the liver and muscle of Svalbard reindeer culled in August 2022 and October 2023. Seasonal differences were observed, with higher concentrations of THg, Cd, and several PFAS in October, likely reflecting an extended foraging time following the winter fasting. The PFAS profiles, dominated by PFOS and long-chain PFCAs, primarily suggest exposure to long-range transported contaminants rather than local sources, highlighting that even remote terrestrial wildlife is affected by emissions from industrialized regions. While Cd and Pb concentrations have decreased compared to levels reported in the 1980s, PFAS concentrations have increased over the past decade. These findings underscore the need for continued monitoring of Arctic terrestrial wildlife, particularly in the context of environmental change and remobilisation of legacy contaminants."

This study presents the first comprehensive assessment of traditional and emerging PFAS in the Amundsen Sea Polynya (ASP) during the austral summer (December 2023 to January 2024), integrating their occurrence in seawater and biological samples with key hydrographic and biogeochemical parameters. Short-chain compounds, such as perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), exhibited nearshore enrichment driven by atmospheric deposition followed by summertime meltwater release. Continuous sea-ice formation and brine rejection within the ASP further promoted the expulsion of PFBA with brine and its accumulation in the underlying Winter Water layer. In contrast, long-chain compounds, particularly 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid (6:2 FTSA), were preferentially incorporated into sea ice and advected toward the ASP margin─typically the marginal ice zone (MIZ)─by strong offshore winds. Their subsequent release during late-summer melting, coincident with elevated colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), resulted in enhanced 6:2 FTSA concentrations throughout the MIZ water column, possibly modulated by both microbial transformation and particle adsorption–settling processes. High bioaccumulation and biomagnification of 6:2 FTSA in Antarctic krill and Adélie penguins highlight its ecological risk to the Antarctic marine ecosystem. Furthermore, PFBA detection in Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) suggests potential interbasin transport via the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC), implying that global mid- and deep-ocean waters may serve as a long-term reservoir for PFAS."

We investigated the potential of hydrogenotrophic denitrification within the anodic compartment to mitigate N2O emissions during NH4+ removal. In situ hydrogen (H2) addition effectively reduced N2O concentrations to below 0.01 mg of N/L, without nitrate or nitrite accumulation. Batch experiments demonstrated that the suspended biomass exhibited a high capacity for N2O reduction, which was strongly dependent on H2 availability and linked to denitrification activities.

Satellite-based instruments provide a way to independently monitor methane emissions from various sources at different scales, helping to assess the progress toward emission reduction targets. In this paper, we apply several data-driven methods to estimate methane emissions from the Secunda CTL (coal-to-liquids) synthetic fuel plant in South Africa, utilizing satellite observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) aboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) satellite and the GHGSat fleet of high-resolution commercial satellites. We find annual mean emissions of about 13–22 t/h based on S5P/TROPOMI observations. These results are consistent with estimates from an automated TROPOMI methane plume detection and quantification method. Estimates based on GHGSat observations from individual sources within the plant sum to about 6 t/h, on average. For comparison, Sasol, the operator of the Secunda CTL facility, reported methane emissions of 11.5 t/h for the period July 2023–June 2024, a value that falls between the TROPOMI- and GHGSat-based estimates. Our results highlight the value of satellite observations as a useful audit complementing reported emissions and demonstrate the importance of combining coarse- and fine-resolution data to monitor methane emissions at the plant and intrafacility level in complex sources."

Here, we use random forest machine learning to estimate the impact of freight activity on hourly NOx concentrations and determine summertime ozone production regimes across the LA basin. We find that freight activity contributes over half of weekday NOx impacts relative to non-truck traffic. During peak ozone hours, coastal areas, south LA, areas downwind (east) of downtown LA, and downtown San Bernardino are VOC-limited. Our results suggest that as of 2021, the Los Angeles urban core and nearby downwind areas have not transitioned to a NOx-limited regime on most days during the May to September ozone season.

Despite a strong increase in regional VPD due to climate change, we find no significant trend in VPD on fire ignition days (VPDF). This discrepancy is due to a decreasing climatological mean (VPDF‐m), driven by the expansion of fires into higher‐latitude and higher‐altitude regions with climatologically lower VPD, and a relatively stable anomaly (VPDF‐a). The weak trend in this VPDF‐a is, in turn, a result of two opposing trends: a significant increase in the thermodynamic contribution from background warming, offset by a weakening of the dynamic contribution from circulation patterns. This lowering of the circulation “bar” for ignition, where less extreme weather is now sufficient to start large fires, explains the observed spatial expansion of fire risk, meaning regions historically less prone to fires now face heightened risk."

These biases manifest as a meridional dipole with warm SSTs in northern tropics and cool SSTs in south. Surface wind induced by interhemispheric SST gradient could intensify southward Ekman transport and reshape the shallow meridional overturning circulation (SMOC). Over the10°S–20°S region, the downward motion of SMOC leads to anomalous subsurface warming, while enhanced evaporation drives surface cooling—weakening vertical thermal structure. Over the equator–10°S, despite favorable upwelling conditions, subsurface remains warm. We attribute this to an overly strong simulation of Indonesian Throughflow, which suppresses the cooling effect of SMOC upwelling. Our results highlight the crucial role of SMOC in connecting the SST bias and subsurface thermal state in climate models and emphasize the need to constrain tropical IO air‐sea interactions for improving SST simulations."

Among these, the quasi‐two‐day wave (QTDW) plays a prominent role in modulating MLT dynamics. In this study, we utilize more than 11 years (November 2013–March 2025) of Sri Venkateswara University (SVU) meteor radar observations made at a low‐latitude site (13.63°N, 79.4°E), SVU, Tirupati, India, to investigate the characteristics and impacts of the QTDW, as well as its contribution to momentum and heat transport in the MLT region, which remains poorly understood. The horizontal momentum flux (u′v′‾) $\overline{{u}^{\mathit{\prime }}{v}^{\mathit{\prime }}})$ zonal heat flux (u′T′‾ $\overline{{u}^{\mathit{\prime }}{T}^{\mathit{\prime }}}$), and meridional heat flux (v′T′)‾ $(\overline{{v}^{\mathit{\prime }}{T}^{\mathit{\prime }})}$ were analyzed using horizontal winds and the ambipolar diffusion coefficient (derived from meteor decay time). The ambipolar diffusion coefficient, which is directly related to the background temperature, was used for the heat flux estimation. The results reveal distinct seasonal and height‐dependent variations. In general, the horizontal momentum flux and zonal heat flux exhibited opposite trends relative to the background zonal mean wind during the solstices above 90 km ‐positive flux during the winter solstice and negative flux during the summer solstice. The meridional heat flux remained positive throughout, with enhanced values during the solstices and in October.

Here, an automated dynamic chamber system equipped with dual measurement chambers (MC1, MC2) was employed to measure HONO fluxes from wheat fields in the Huaihe River Basin, with alternating measurements of gas concentrations inside the chambers achieved via solenoid valve switching. Laboratory and field evaluations confirmed the feasibility of this flux measurement system. Two MCs were separated by 7 m, covering a wheat field at the seedling stage with low seedling coverage. The field results revealed similar diurnal variation patterns of HONO fluxes in MC1 and MC2, with higher fluxes observed at noon, and their mean values were 1.06 and 1.41 ng N m−2 s−1, respectively. Correlation analysis indicated that photosensitized conversion of NO2 on soil surfaces and microbial processes contribute comparably to HONO flux in the MC1, whereas microbial processes play a relatively more important role in the MC2. The higher inorganic nitrogen levels in the MC2 further suggest that enhanced nitrification may have increased HONO emissions. Further analysis showed that when the HONO flux difference between MC1 and MC2 is most significant, it may be caused by temperature‐induced variations in soil microbial processes, while the flux difference on some dates is likely associated with changes in NO2 × J(NO2). Our study provides the field evidence for understanding the spatial heterogeneity of HONO emissions from agricultural soils."

To clarify this critical issue, we approached the problem from two perspectives. First, it is found that the rupture of a sub‐100 μm bubble (diameter < 100 μm) generates only 3–4 jet drops. Second, as sub‐100 μm bubbles ascend, their size distributions would remain relatively unchanged.

Moreover, the production rate of jet drops from sub‐100 μm bubbles decreases with increasing temperature, with no significant change in drop size.

The health impact sensitivities show large spatial variability over the northern hemisphere and exhibit a great deal of seasonal variability, especially for inorganic precursor emissions. The largest marginal impacts are seen for NH3 and primary PM2.5. The estimated health impacts for a 10% reduction in emissions reveal a hemispheric burden of 513,700 avoided mortality and monetized health benefits at above 1.2 trillion USD2016. The largest regional contribution to hemispheric mortality is found to be in East and South Asia, particularly China and India (183,760 and 123,440 for a 10% reduction in emissions, respectively). Monetized health burdens are estimated to be highest in China and Europe (∼365 and ∼252 million USD for a 10% reduction in emissions) while it is relatively similar in India (∼175 million USD) as in Canada and the United States (∼177 million USD). Sectoral source contribution analysis demonstrates that the agriculture (19%) and residential (15%) sectors are the largest contributors to the northern hemispheric scale health burden, however, regional differences exist in the results.

 Crystalline silicates form at high temperatures (>900 K) (refs. 1,2). Their presence in comets3–6 suggests that high-temperature dust processing occurred in the early Solar System and was subsequently transported outwards to comet-forming regions. However, direct evidence for this crystallization and redistribution in Sun-like protostars has remained unknown. By comparing James Webb Space Telescope mid-infrared spectra of the periodically bursting protostar EC 53 (ref. 7), we detect crystalline silicate (forsterite and enstatite) emission features that appear only during the burst. The emergence of these features indicates active crystal formation by thermal annealing in the hot inner disk during the accretion burst. We also detect a nested outflow—a collimated atomic jet enclosed by slower molecular outflows, consistent with magnetohydrodynamic wind models8. This configuration provides a mechanism for the outward transport of freshly crystallized silicates9. To our knowledge, our results provide the first direct observational evidence of in situ silicate crystallization during episodic accretion bursts in a very young star still embedded in its dense envelope. Although we do not directly detect grains transported to the outer disk, the observed trends are consistent with outward redistribution, indicating that both dust processing and transport occur during the earliest and most dynamic stages of star formation.

Here we compile a global atmospheric MPs dataset and compare it with size-aligned MP model simulations. Our model simulations show two to four orders of magnitude overestimation of the measured global median atmospheric MP concentrations. Measured median concentrations over the ocean are 27 times lower than over the land (0.003 and 0.08 particles m−3, respectively).

 How Stonehenge’s building blocks arrived on Salisbury Plain remains debated, with glacial and human transport mechanisms proposed. Here we test the possibility of Pleistocene glacial sediment input using grain-scale U–Pb fingerprinting of detrital zircon and apatite from modern stream sediments surrounding Stonehenge. Zircon ages span 3396–285 Ma, with age peaks at ~1090, 1690, and 1740 Ma, matching the Laurentian basement of northern Britain. Salisbury Plain detrital zircon ages match those of southern British rocks sourced from the London Basin, implying local sediment recycling rather than glaciogenic transport. Apatite ages of ~60 Ma reflect post-depositional U–Pb resetting, consistent with the distal effects of the Alpine orogeny. Collectively, our data show Salisbury Plain remained unglaciated during the Pleistocene, making direct glacial transport of Stonehenge’s megaliths unlikely.

 Seagrasses play a vital role in coastal ecosystems, providing habitat, stabilising sediments, and contributing to carbon sequestration. However, global warming has increased the frequency and intensity of heatwaves, posing a significant threat to seagrass health. This study investigates the effects of marine and atmospheric heatwaves on the spectral reflectance of the intertidal seagrass Zostera noltii. Laboratory experiments were conducted under controlled heatwave conditions, where hyperspectral reflectance measurements were taken to assess the impacts over time. Simulated heatwave conditions caused a substantial decline in seagrass reflectance, particularly in the green and near-infrared regions, corresponding to the darkening of green leaves. Key vegetation indices, including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Green Leaf Index (GLI), showed pronounced reductions under heatwave stress, with NDVI values decreasing by up to 34% and GLI by 57%. A novel metric, the Seagrass Heat Shock Index (SHSI), was developed to quantify the transition of seagrass leaves from green to brown, demonstrating a stronger ability to capture the effects of heatwave exposure on seagrass colouration. Multispectral satellite observations corroborated the laboratory results, revealing widespread darkening of seagrass leaves during marine and atmospheric heatwave events in South Brittany, France. Notably, darkened seagrass patches were observed in intertidal areas exposed to air temperatures exceeding 32 °C for over 13.5 h per day. These findings highlight the potential of spectral reflectance as a tool for detecting early signs of heatwave-induced stress in seagrasses, offering a valuable method for remote sensing-based habitat assessment.

 Accurate pan-sharpening of multispectral images is essential for high-resolution remote sensing, yet supervised methods are limited by the need for paired training data and poor generalization. Existing unsupervised approaches often neglect the physical consistency between degradation and fusion and lack sufficient constraints, resulting in suboptimal performance in complex scenarios. We propose RevFus, a novel two-stage pan-sharpening framework. In the first stage, an invertible neural network models the degradation process and reverses it for fusion with cycle-consistency self-learning, ensuring a physically grounded mapping. In the second stage, structural detail compensation and spatial–spectral contrastive learning alleviate detail loss and enhance spectral–spatial fidelity. To further understand the network’s decision-making, we design a quantitative and systematic measure of model interpretability, the Interpretability Efficacy Coefficient (IEC). IEC integrates multiple statistics derived from SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values into a single unified score and try to evaluate how effectively a model balances spatial detail enhancement with spectral preservation. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that RevFus outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and traditional methods, delivering superior spectral fidelity, enhanced spatial detail, and high model interpretability, thereby validating the effectiveness of the interpretable deep learning framework for robust, high-quality pan-sharpening."

 Obtaining accurate geometric positioning information for images is crucial for the application of remote sensing images in stereo mapping, map production, and target positioning. However, for optical remote sensing satellite images and archived historical images, the geometric positioning methods vary, and different control data formats are needed. This limits the timeliness of applying optical remote sensing images and has become a bottleneck for the unified and standardized processing of such images. In response, this paper presents a framework for optimizing the geometric positioning accuracy of optical remote sensing images. A lightweight vector control library (LVCL) is constructed to serve as the control data for the geometric positions of the optical images, and a rough positioning method based on a mutual feedback constraint-matching strategy and multiple associated images is proposed to obtain approximate positions of the target images quickly. Moreover, optimal iteration and segmented connection based vector matching methods are proposed to accurately match the target image to images in the LVCL, thereby providing the target image’s geographical information based on the control data. Experiments conducted across multiple regions show that this framework can effectively match remote sensing images with the geographic coordinates in the LVCL: the data storage volume is only 1/10 to 1/3893 of that of traditional and existing lightweight methods, demonstrating prominent lightweight advantages; among the images from 13 cities, the correct rough positioning matching results for 12 cities rank among the top 10, with 7 achieving the first place; the number of vector construction nodes in 62 regions is better than that of the comparison strategy; the vector matching results are correct and the number of matching points is the largest; for the 13 regions, the average positioning deviation decreases from 156.590 m to 4.098 m, and the maximum deviation decreases from 582.142 m to 10.588 m, with systematic errors significantly corrected. Thus, the proposed framework is expected to become a new paradigm for obtaining the geometric positions of optical remote sensing images."

 Mitigating pollutants and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is a core strategic imperative for China, necessitating integrated technological solutions. Satellite remote sensing (SRS) has emerged as a pivotal tool for environmental monitoring, enhancing our understanding of pollutants and GHG emissions from space and supports policy-making. Here we summarize the recent research advances regarding the role of SRS in monitoring pollutants and GHG emissions in China, focusing on three key applications: 1) pollutant emission tracking, 2) carbon emission quantification, and 3) synergistic monitoring of pollution-carbon interactions. Current analysis identifies substantial progress achieved over the past decades, but critical limitations remain. From a scientific perspective, both ground observation networks and professional sensors are lacking for improving retrieval accuracy. Moreover, artificial intelligence (AI)-based data-mining theory is inadequate. From a practical perspective, high-resolution satellite provides insufficient coverage for nationwide carbon monitoring and data deficiencies hinders intelligent monitoring systems. To address these challenges, we provide the following strategic priorities: 1) establishing integrated Space-Air-Ground observation systems, 2) accelerating the deployment of next-generation monitoring satellites and developing related retrieval algorithms, and 3) developing AI-based monitoring systems through multisource data integration. This review enhances the understanding of SRS applications and provides directions for future research aimed at mitigating pollutant and GHG emissions, thereby supporting China’s dual carbon goals and sustainable development worldwide."

 Rapid decline in lung function is a key phenotype of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is associated with disease progression and a poor prognosis. However, time-specific dynamics of pollutant exposure and their impacts on this phenotype remain unclear. In this retrospective cohort study, we investigated how period-specific particulate matter (PM) exposure relates to lung function rapid decline in individuals with COPD. Clinical and individual factors and ambient PM exposures were collected, and participants were categorized into rapid-decline and non-rapid-decline groups based on forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) trajectories. A modified exponentially weighted moving average approach was used for estimating PM2.5 and PM10 exposure levels across the baseline, early follow-up, and late follow-up periods. Regression and machine learning models assessed period-specific effects, with variable importance evaluated via Shapley additive explanation. The rapid-decline group had significantly higher baseline lung function but greater annual FEV1 reductions than the non-rapid-decline group (both p < 0.01). After adjusting for confounding factors, PM exposures were associated with FEV1 declines (PM2.5: −280.62 to −267.38 mL/year; PM10: −305.15 to −246.89 mL/year, all p < 0.01) and increased odds ratio of rapid FEV1 decline (PM2.5: 1.76–1.95; PM10: 1.62–1.96, all p < 0.05), particularly evident in models emphasizing the baseline and late follow-up periods. Baseline PM2.5 and PM10 exposures, and age were identified as the most influential predictors. These findings suggest that period-specific PM exposure may critically contribute to the development of lung function rapid decline in COPD. Considering environmental, temporal, and individual-level factors may help improve disease management."

 To examine decadal changes in aerosol pollution, trends, hotspots, and aerosol types across the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), north-east India (NEI), and the Himalayas, a 25-year (2000–2024) analysis was conducted using MODIS and MERRA-2 datasets. The highest aerosol loading and trend (MODIS AOD) occurred over the lower IGP (0.71 ± 0.09; 0.016 yr−1), followed by the middle IGP (0.65 ± 0.10; 0.009 yr−1), upper IGP (0.51 ± 0.10; 0.003 yr−1), and NEI (0.40 ± 0.10; 0.008 yr−1). Within the Himalayas, the central region showed the highest AOD (0.24 ± 0.09) with low trends (0.001–0.003 yr−1). Significant rising trends were observed in SO42−AOD over the lower IGP (0.006 yr−1) and OCAOD over NEI (0.004 yr−1). AOD across the entire IGP and NEI increased by more than 20 % in the 2010s relative to the 2000s. Notably, SO42−AOD increased by ∼30–40 % over the lower IGP, while OCAOD rose by over 50 % in NEI and the eastern Himalayas, with an additional 30–40 % rise during 2020–2024. Bangladesh, the lower IGP, and NEI consistently emerged as hotspots of carbonaceous and sulphate aerosols, shifting into highly polluted zones after 2020. The upper and middle IGP for the western and central Himalayas and NEI and the lower IGP acted as major source regions. Clean-continental and biomass/urban aerosols dominated the Himalayas, whereas anthropogenic aerosols prevailed over the IGP and NEI, with notable increases across the Himalayas after 2020. These insights can guide targeted mitigation strategies for the IGP and vulnerable Himalayan regions."

 Indoor dust (ID) is a key indicator of indoor air quality, reflecting both human activity and the infiltration of outdoor pollutants. This study integrates magnetic, geochemical, and microscopic methods to identify pollution sources by characterizing magnetic particles (MPs) in ID collected from residential locations in the Warsaw metropolitan area. Fine (<0.071 mm) and coarse (0.071–1.0 mm) dust fractions were analyzed alongside road dust (RD) and wood ash to differentiate between indoor and outdoor contributions. Magnetite was identified as the primary magnetic mineral, accompanied by metallic Fe and/or iron-based alloys. Decomposition of isothermal remanent magnetization acquisition curves revealed two main coercivity components in ID, while RD and ash exhibited distinct magnetic signatures. Scanning electron microscopy identified technogenic MPs, such as ferrospheres and abrasion-derived flakes, while geochemical analyses highlighted associations between Fe and heavy metals (e.g., Zn, Pb). Cluster analysis indicated both anthropogenic (traffic, biomass combustion, industry) and natural (soil, crustal) origins. Based on these findings, potentially toxic metals were correlated with their likely sources: sulfur from coal burning; zinc, copper, and lead from vehicle emissions; calcium from construction activities; and chromium from indoor sources such as chrome-plated surfaces. Variations in dust composition among apartments—especially in the fine fraction mass and magnetic properties—underscore the influence of ventilation, proximity to traffic, and resident behavior. This study confirms that magnetic methods provide a nondestructive, cost-effective approach for tracking external pollutants in ID and underscores their potential as a screening tool for assessing urban environmental health risks."

 Reliable near–surface air temperature (Ta) over the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is critical for energy balance closure, cryosphere assessment, and land–atmosphere modeling, yet complex relief and sparse gauges challenge gridded fields. We build a daily, lineage-spanning benchmark across 20 research-grade stations to evaluate five representative datasets—global land reanalysis, observation-conditioned regional fusions, and recent kilometer-scale, observation-based interpolations—under a unified collocation. Performance is stratified by eco-climatic zone (HI/HII), ground-thermal state (permafrost/seasonally frozen), and 500-m elevation bands. Observation-conditioned fields outperform the purely model-driven ERA5-Land reanalysis at the daily scale; the reanalysis shows a pervasive cold bias, strongest in HII winter. Elevation composites indicate rising R2 and shrinking MAE from 3.0 to 4.5 km, with winter weakest seasonally. A lightweight two-stage correction—regime-aware height normalization (γ) followed by quantile mapping—cuts MAE by 0.5–2.0 °C and removes height-dependent cold bias. A unitless usability matrix translates multi-metric skill into scene-specific guidance by season–zone–elevation, offering an operational pathway to select and minimally correct TP Ta forcings transferable to other high-relief regions."

 This article provides a comprehensive overview of the spatiotemporal variation, chemical characteristics, and source identification of PM2.5 in the coastal and island regions of East Asia. We aimed to comprehensively ascertain the mass concentration and chemical signature of PM2.5 in these distinctive maritime environments. To begin with, the inter-comparison of PM2.5's sampling and analytical methods applied by previous researches were extensively employed. The spatial distribution of PM2.5's mass concentrations and chemical composition were explored throughout the coasts and islands in East Asia. Coastal regions commonly exhibited considerably higher PM2.5 concentrations (152.40 ± 51.20 μg/m3 in North China to 8.34 ± 4.60 μg/m3 in South Taiwan) than those at the island sites (63.08 ± 39.04 μg/m3 in Bohai Sea to 8.82 ± 4.09 μg/m3 in Western Pacific Ocean) with the distinct chemical fingerprints of PM2.5 originated from continental and maritime sources, respectively. The source identification of PM2.5 in the coastal and island regions clarify their distinct chemical characteristics and dominant sources. Coastal regions were predominantly influenced by industrial emissions, vehicular exhausts, and shipping activities, whereas island regions showed greater contributions from long-range transport, oceanic spray, and ship emissions. This article further investigated three major influential factors specifically affecting PM2.5 levels in coastal regions and at islands of East Asia, including pollution sources, weather patterns, and transporting pathways. The study identified three distinct transport channels, namely the West, East, and South Channels which exhibited markedly different PM2.5 levels: the West Channel (38.65 ± 17.07 μg/m3), East Channel (11.28 ± 5.11 μg/m3), and South Channel (9.16 ± 2.71 μg/m3). Anthropogenic sources were the major contributors to PM2.5, while weather patterns and meteorological phenomena also played essential roles in shaping its spatiotemporal variation in East Asia. Moreover, this article further addressed the cluster of transport pathways in assessing three transport channels of PM2.5. By synthesizing the findings from previous investigations, it provided a comprehensive understanding of PM2.5 pollution dynamics in the coastal regions and at the islands of East Asia. It underscored the needs for targeting the interventions and pollution control measures to address the diverse sources and the complex atmospheric conditions."

We developed a new computer model showing how plane structures create air swirls that make contrails wider and denser than thought. These thicker contrails likely trap more heat. Our findings help improve climate predictions and guide aircraft designs to reduce aviation's warming effects. 
 Contrails – ice clouds forming in aircraft wakes – may have a radiative impact up to twice that of CO2 emissions from aviation, though significant uncertainties remain. Understanding the entire contrail life cycle, from initial ice crystal formation to potential evolution into persistent cirrus clouds, requires addressing the wide range of spatial and temporal scales involved.This work presents a novel numerical methodology for simulating contrails from ice crystal formation onset to wingtip vortex dissipation. Unlike conventional methods relying on analytical initialization using Lamb-Oseen vortex pairs, our approach couples Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) with Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and synthetic turbulence techniques. This enables more accurate capture of near-field effects and detailed consideration of how aircraft geometry influences aerodynamic wake and contrail evolution.Applied to realistic aircraft geometry under standard atmospheric conditions, our methodology revealed that horizontal tailplane vortices trigger short-wavelength instabilities in the main wingtip vortices, significantly modifying secondary wake structure. Compared to conventional methods, contrails generated through our methodology are wider with larger cross-sectional areas in the first few minutes following ice crystals formation. Previous studies showed contrail spatial dimensions significantly affect contrail-cirrus properties; for instance, under identical initial ice crystal number and mass, an A380 contrail-cirrus exhibits 20 % greater total extinction than a CRJ200 due to different contrail sizes.We propose a modified conventional method incorporating a quadripolar wake – two main wingtip vortices plus two secondary horizontal tailplane vortices – that more closely matches our methodology's simulations, which more precisely account for near-field aerodynamic effects."

 The global reduction in shipping fuel sulphur that culminated in 2020 with an ∼ 80 % reduction has created a large-scale natural experiment on the role of aerosol-cloud interaction (ACI) in the climate system. We compare observations from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program's Eastern North Atlantic site (ARM-ENA; 39.1° N, 28.0° W) during two June to September periods: 2016–2018 (pre-2020) and 2021–2023 (post-2020). We find a significant (∼ 15 %) decrease in cloud condensation nuclei concentrations post-2020, which resulted in a decrease in cloud droplet number (Nd) and an increase in effective radius (re) of marine boundary layer clouds. However, cloud liquid water path (LWP) increased post-2020. The increase in LWP offset the increase in re, resulting in insignificant changes to optical depth. MODIS and CERES data in the vicinity of ENA during these periods produce similar results also with negligible change in albedo and optical depth. Regional cloud occurrence declined in line with changes in the large-scale meteorology. Our results highlight the complex interplay of factors that modulate cloud feedbacks in the Eastern North Atlantic."

Absorption signatures differ between Icelandic and low/mid-latitude dust due to differences in mineralogical composition. Spectral differences could be used to characterise the mineralogy and trace the origin of airborne dust based on infrared remote sensing observations. 
 Mineral dust absorbs and scatters solar and infrared radiation, thereby affecting the radiance spectrum at the surface and top-of-atmosphere and the atmospheric heating rate. While half of the outgoing thermal radiation is emitted in the far infrared (FIR, 15–100 µm), knowledge of the optical properties and thermal radiative effects of dust is currently limited to the mid-infrared region (MIR, 3–15 µm). In this study we performed pellet spectroscopy measurements to evaluate the MIR and FIR contribution to dust absorbance and explore the variability and spectral diversity of the dust signature within the 2.5–25 µm range. Thirteen dust samples re-suspended from parent soils with contrasting mineralogy were investigated, including low and mid latitude dust (LMLD) sources in Africa, America, Asia, and Middle East, and high latitude dust (HLD) from Iceland. Results show that the absorbance of dust in the FIR up to 25 µm is comparable in intensity to that in the MIR. Also, spectrally different absorption (position and shape of the peaks) is observed for Icelandic dust compared to LMLD, due to differences in mineralogical composition. Corroborated with the few available literature data on absorption properties of natural dust and single minerals up to 100 µm wavelength, these data suggest the relevance of MIR and FIR interactions to the dust radiative effect for low to high latitude sources. Furthermore, the dust spectral signatures in the MIR and FIR could potentially be used to characterise the mineralogy and differentiate the origin of airborne particles based on infrared remote sensing observations."

We found that the reductions in anthropogenic precursors had limited impacts on SOA formation. The results highlight the increasing role of gas-phase oxidation under low-pollution conditions, emphasizing the need for effective ozone control strategies to mitigate SOA formation. 
 Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is a dominant constituent of fine particulate matter, exerting significant impacts on both climate and human health. Oxalic acid (C2), a key end-product formed from the oxidation of volatile organic compounds, can provide insights into the formation mechanism of SOA. Thus, long-term measurements of C2 and related compounds help understand the changes in SOA formation with decreasing pollutant levels. In this study, C2 and its homologs, along with five primary anthropogenic source markers and three SOA markers, were measured in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) during 2007–2018. The concentrations of C2 did not exhibit significant downward trends, despite substantial reductions in anthropogenic emissions, such as biomass burning (−11 % yr−1), vehicle emissions (−17 % yr−1), and cooking emissions (−7 % yr−1). Correlation analysis revealed that aerosol liquid water content (ALWC) and Ox (O3 + NO2) were the main drivers of C2 variations. Moreover, the relative contribution of biogenic SOA increased under cleaner conditions. A machine learning model was applied to quantify the impacts of changes in anthropogenic precursor emissions, biogenic precursor emissions, aqueous-phase oxidation processes, and gas-phase oxidation processes on C2 variability. As pollution levels declined, the impacts of gas-phase oxidation increased from 37 % to 55 %, whereas that of aqueous-phase oxidation declined from 42 % to 30 %. This shift indicated a transition from aqueous-phase to gas-phase pathways in C2 and SOA formation. Our findings highlight the increasing importance of gas-phase oxidation under low-pollution conditions and underscore the need for effective ozone control strategies to further reduce SOA in the future."

This new dataset enhances global climate monitoring efforts, supports the validation of satellites, will help assess regional emission trends, filling a critical observational gap in this climate-sensitive region. 
 Long-term greenhouse gas (GHG) measurements are essential for understanding the carbon cycle, detecting trends in atmospheric composition, and assessing the efficiency of climate change mitigation strategies. However, observational gaps over large geographic areas such as the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East (EMME), a well-known regional GHG hotspot, are likely to increase uncertainties in estimations of their sources and sinks. Here, we describe a new Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) observatory for solar absorption spectroscopy measurements that has been operating in Nicosia, Cyprus, since September 2019. The site helps bridge a regional observational gap in the EMME, a strategic location at the crossroads of air masses from Europe, Asia, and Africa. Using near-infrared (NIR, InGaAs detector) solar absorption spectra, TCCON-Nicosia measures total column average dry-air mole fractions (Xgas) of key trace gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen fluoride (HF), water vapor (H2O), and semi-heavy water (HDO). These continuous observations, spanning more than 4 years, are presented along with a description of the quality control procedures, compliant with the TCCON standards, to ensure total column atmospheric data with minimal errors.In 2023, observations were extended into the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral region with the addition of a liquid-nitrogen-cooled InSb (LN2-InSb) detector enabling the retrieval of additional trace gases such as formaldehyde (HCHO), carbonyl sulfide (OCS), nitrogen monoxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ethane (C2H6), herewith further contributing to the global Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC).To tie the TCCON Nicosia with the WMO reference scale, an AirCore (AC) campaign conducted in June 2020 over Cyprus provided vertical in situ profiles, which were converted into total column quantities (AC.Xgas) and compared to TCCON observations (Xgas). The TCCON/in situ comparison showed agreement well within their respective uncertainty budget."

Simulated reflectivities show strong sensitivity to particle size distributions and frozen hydrometeor habits. Results highlight the role of microphysical assumptions in radar forward modeling and their importance for assimilating spaceborne radar data in weather prediction models. 
 Accurate forward models, particularly radiative transfer models, are essential for the assimilation of both passive and active satellite  observations in modern data assimilation frameworks. The Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM), widely used in the assimilation of satellite observations within numerical weather prediction systems, especially in the United States, has recently been expanded to include a radar module. This study assesses the new module across multiple radar frequencies using observations from the Earth Clouds, Aerosols and Radiation Explorer Cloud Profiling Radar (EarthCARE CPR), the CloudSat CPR, and the Global Precipitation Measurement Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar (GPM DPR). Simulated radar reflectivities were compared with the spaceborne measurements to evaluate the impacts of hydrometeor profiles, particle size  distributions (PSDs), and frozen hydrometeor habits. The results indicate that both PSD selection and particle shape largely influence the simulated  reflectivities, with snow particle habits introducing differences of up to 4 dBZ in W-band comparisons. For the GPM DPR, reflectivities simulated using the Thompson PSD showed closer agreement with the observations than those using the Abel PSD; this agreement should be interpreted in the context of the limited independence between the observations and the retrievals used as input to the CRTM, which themselves rely on PSD-related assumptions. The sensitivity of forward radar simulations to microphysical assumptions, underscores their importance in the assimilation of radar observations in numerical weather forecast models."

Watts;Annett Bartsch,A satellite-based ice fraction record for small water bodies of the Arctic Coastal Plain (2017 to 2023),"Ice cover on small water bodies is highly sensitive to climate change and influences ecosystems, water, and the carbon cycle. We produced a satellite-based ice fraction dataset for small water bodies on the Arctic Coastal Plain from 2017 to 2023. The dataset captures freeze-up and break-up timing and reveals spatial variability. It will support studies of climate–ice interactions and improve models of water and carbon processes. 
 Ice cover of water bodies in the northern high latitudes (NHL) is highly sensitive to the changing climate, and its dynamics exert substantial impacts on the NHL ecosystems, hydrological processes, and the carbon cycle. Yet, operational quantification of ice cover dynamics for smaller water bodies (e.g., ≤25 km2) over vast, remote NHL regions remains limited. Here, we developed an ice fraction dataset for small water bodies (ponds, lakes, and rivers; 900 m2 to 25 km2) across the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska (ACP) from 2017 through 2023, using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, texture features, and Daymet air temperature data. The dataset has a spatial resolution of 1 km and a temporal resolution of approximately 6 d. Compared with the Google Dynamic World (DW) product derived from Sentinel-2 optical remote sensing, our dataset shows high consistency with DW (R=0.91, RMSE=0.19) while having enhanced temporal coverage due to less SAR constraints from solar illumination, cloud cover, and atmospheric conditions. Validation against in-situ observations suggests that our dataset is more capable of capturing small water body ice phenology (e.g., freeze-up and break-up dates) relative to DW, with an 11 d reduction in mean absolute error. Our ice fraction dataset reveals high spatial heterogeneity in ice conditions mainly occurring in June for small water bodies across the ACP. The ice phenology analysis over three selected subregions further shows that a warmer transition period generally leads to earlier ice break-up and later freeze-up, while the responses of ice fraction to warming climate vary among and within individual water bodies. The resulting dataset is anticipated to fill a gap in ice phenology studies for small water bodies, improve our understanding on the interactions between ice dynamics and climate change, and enhance the coupled modelling of ice and carbon processes. The S1 ice fraction dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17033546 (Lin et al., 2025)."

 A major shift in Arctic sea ice occurred in 2007, transitioning from thicker, deformed ice to thinner, more uniform ice with reduced surface roughness. This abrupt change likely altered the dynamic and thermodynamic interactions between sea ice and ocean, with potential implications for nutrient and biogeochemical cycles in both sea ice and the upper ocean. In this study, we present a suite of regional coupled ocean-sea ice simulations designed to assess the potential impact of the regime shift on sea ice–ocean interactions, with a regional focus on the Atlantic sector of the Arctic Ocean. The different sea ice regimes are represented by changes in ice thickness distribution described by ice thickness classes in the sea ice model, and the effects of the different regimes are simulated through variations in the drag coefficient diagnosed from the ice thickness distribution. We emulate the two sea ice regimes by prescribing sea ice properties at the model's lateral boundaries. The results suggest a weaker dynamical coupling between sea ice and ocean in the new sea-ice regimes, leading to enhanced surface stratification, suppression of vertical mixing and momentum transfer to deeper layers. The simulation framework and the physical analyses presented here serve as a basis for ocean biogeochemical modelling studies that aim at understanding ocean ecosystem responses to changing Arctic sea ice."

Using data from the UK Biobank cohort study, we assessed associations between three individual markers of socioeconomic position: educational attainment, household income, and employment status, and three environmental exposure domains: residential airborne pollutants, residential road traffic noise, and residential green and blue space. In urban areas, participants with lower educational attainment, lower household income, or those who were unemployed exhibit a higher exposure to airborne pollutants. Household income also influences the vicinity to green spaces and natural environments, with lower incomes experiencing less green and natural environments in both the rural and urban contexts. Retired individuals experienced lower exposure to airborne pollutants and lived in areas with more green spaces or natural environments compared with employed individuals. These patterns were consistent across England, Scotland, and Wales, although some geographical and national differences were observed. The study highlights the complex interplay among socioeconomic factors, geographical location, and environmental exposures. Our findings suggest that socioeconomic position is a key determinant of specific external exposomes, with socioeconomically disadvantaged groups experiencing more adverse environmental conditions."

Corals are known to incorporate microplastics, which could potentially provide an archive of information to trace present and past microplastic pollution. In this study, a label-free chemical analytical method for rapid visualization of microplastics incorporated in coral tissue and skeletons is proposed by using a coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscope combined with two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) detection. Acropora polystoma was maintained in an environment with a high concentration of polyethylene (PE) beads ranging from 0.7 to 5 μm in size. PE beads were successfully visualized, and the number of incorporated beads per skeleton area was quantitatively analyzed using the proposed technique. Notably, plastic beads were only found in the skeleton of coral colonies showing signs of localized tissue loss. Further CARS analysis of tissue found that a number of microplastics were trapped in the areas where tissue loss was observed due to bleaching or physical tissue removal, whereas minimal amounts were observed within healthy tissue. These results suggest that unhealthy conditions which lead to tissue loss and bleaching may accelerate microplastic incorporation into coral tissue and further into skeletons. Our study shows the ability of our CARS-based method to help understand how microplastics are incorporated into corals and will lead to improved tracking of their accumulation in coral reefs."

Early generation gas-phase products of isoprene oxidation remain to be fully characterized. •OH addition at terminal C1/C4 followed by the addition of O2, yields β- and δ-peroxy (ISOPO2•) isomers. Under low-nitric oxide conditions, δ-ISOPO2• isomers branch between bimolecular reaction with HO2• and intramolecular H-shifts. Initial C5H8O3 products of H-shifts reported in chamber experiments were assigned δ-hydroperoxyalkenal (HPALD) structures and predicted to photolyze rapidly. We observe by ion mobility spectrometry that a putative δ-HPALD isomer from •OH addition at C4 is the cyclic peroxyhemiacetal, 5-methyl dioxinol, and may be the relevant product in atmospheric chemistry. 5-Methyl dioxinol is robust to photolysis at tropospheric UV–vis wavelengths and is thus potentially a significant previously unrecognized source of SOA. In chamber experiments, we found that 5-methyl dioxinol forms SOA and determined that the steady-state ratio of the proximal major unimolecular/bimolecular products downstream of ISOPO2• is ∼0.26. Using the total steady-state dioxinol level formed in the isoprene oxidation experiment, dioxinols may contribute ∼3.2 × 109 g yr–1, or 4% to isoprene-derived atmospheric carbon."

However, its accuracy has hardly been studied. To assess effectiveness of PUF–PAS for measuring CUPs, 18 PUF–PAS devices were deployed for 1–6 weeks at a school near banana plantations in Costa Rica. Simultaneously, every week air was sampled with high and low volume active air samplers (AAS) for 24 h and 7 days, respectively. Extracts were analyzed using microwave-assisted extraction and LC-MS/MS. Nine CUPs (ethoprophos, difenoconazole, cadusafos, chlorpyrifos, fenpropidin, fenpropimorph, pyrimethanil, spiroxamine, and terbufos) were detected by both PAS and AAS. Concentrations were highest for pyrimethanil (34.3 ng/m3) followed by fenpropidin (9.0 ng/m3) and terbufos (8.4 ng/m3). An average sampling rate of 3.4 m3/day was estimated for PUF–PAS using Lo-AAS data, like previously reported in literature. After 3 weeks of deployment, PUF–PAS detected eight out of nine pesticides, similar to the AAS methods. However, after 4 weeks of deployment, substantial losses (≥50%) were observed for all CUPs except pyrimethanil, likely due to oxidative degradation. We therefore recommend a maximum deployment time of 3 weeks under tropical conditions. These findings support PUF–PAS as a cost-effective alternative for AAS in tropical regions."

In this study, we evaluated the influence of inactive chemicals on mixture modeling outcomes and explored strategies for predicting the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-mediated toxicity of PAC mixtures. Using an in vitro AhR reporter gene assay, we tested seven defined mixtures composed of six active and seven inactive PACs. Observed concentration–response curves were compared to predictions from three established mixture models, concentration addition (CA), independent action (IA), and generalized concentration addition (GCA), using both effective concentration eliciting 10% response (EC10) and benchmark concentration (BMC10) approaches. Including inactive chemicals without scaling led to consistent overestimation of potency, especially in models assuming equal efficacy. Predictive accuracy improved across all models when mixtures were limited to active chemicals and contributions were scaled to 100%, excluding inactives. Among approaches, GCA consistently produced the best agreement with measured responses, particularly when paired with BMC modeling. BMC10 values better accommodate partial agonists. Our findings support a pragmatic, mechanism-based framework for modeling environmental mixtures, one that prioritizes active components, scales their contributions, and adopts BMC-based methods to estimate potency."

Wilson,Dramatic Slowdown of Bimolecular Reactions of Criegee Intermediates in Organic Aerosols,"Although Criegee intermediates (CIs) play a central role in driving the transformation of organic molecules, their condensed-phase reaction kinetics remains poorly understood. While CIs undergo unimolecular decomposition to produce OH radicals, stabilized CIs participate in a host of other bimolecular reactions forming larger molecular weight products, including secondary ozonides (kSOZ), alkoxyalkyl hydroperoxides (kAlAHP), and acyloxyalkyl hydroperoxides (kAcAHP). Here, we demonstrate, using prior literature and new measurements of heterogeneous organic aerosol reactions using O3 or OH radicals, that these condensed-phase bimolecular reaction rate coefficients kSOZ (10–20 cm3·molecule–1·s–1), kAlAHP, and kAcAHP (10–19 cm3·molecule–1·s–1) are 7–10 orders of magnitude slower than analogous gas-phase reactions (∼ 10–10–10–13 cm3·molecule–1·s–1). This contrasts with current evidence that the rate coefficients for unimolecular steps in the condensed phase are similar in magnitude to those in the gas phase. Kinetic models using gas-phase-like bimolecular coefficients consistently overestimate the importance of bimolecular relative to unimolecular pathways while underpredicting the aerosol reactivity by up to 30-fold. The slowing of bimolecular reactivity in aerosols is likely due to solvation effects and the increased steric hindrance of larger molecular weight CIs and their scavengers in the condensed phase. These results challenge the conventional view that the high reactant density of an organic aerosol should favor bimolecular over unimolecular reactions, underscoring the need for more accurate CI condensed-phase rate constants for reliable modeling of oxidative processes across a diverse set of atmospheric and environmental systems."

Mezyk,Going out with a Bang: Absolute Kinetics of Removing Organic Energetic Compounds from Waters Using Hydroxyl Radicals,"Organic energetic compounds (OECs) such as nitroaromatics, nitrate esters, and nitramines are widely used explosives that persist as toxic contaminants in water systems. Among them, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) is of particular concern due to its carcinogenicity and genotoxicity as well as its resistance to current remediation methods. Conventional treatment approaches, such as microbial degradation, phytoremediation, and phase-transfer methods are either inefficient or fail entirely to eliminate this contaminant. Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs), which generate highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (•OH), represent a promising large-scale alternative for degrading persistent organic contaminants like OECs. However, the practical implementation of AOPs depends on the measurement of accurate kinetic data for •OH-OEC reactions. This study quantifies the absolute second-order rate constants for •OH radical reactions with six common OECs (TNT, picric acid (PA), tetryl, nitroglycerin (NG), ethylene glycol dinitrate (EGDN), and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN)) in aqueous solution using pulse radiolysis and competition kinetics. Reaction kinetics were evaluated at environmentally relevant concentrations (3–6 μM), and TNT and PETN were further studied over 10–40 °C to determine Arrhenius activation parameters. Measured •OH reaction rate constants ranged from 0.73 × 109 M–1 s–1 (EGDN) to 8.41 × 109 M–1 s–1 (PETN), with TNT having a value of (1.14 ± 0.05) × 109 M–1 s–1 at room temperature, in excellent agreement with corrected literature values. Activation energies were determined as 42.4 ± 4.3 kJ mol–1 for TNT and 21.6 ± 1.5 kJ mol–1 for PETN. Mechanistic kinetic comparison to model compounds suggests the hydroxyl radical reaction proceeds via hydrogen abstraction for both aliphatic and nitroaromatic species. These findings support the feasibility of hydroxyl radical-driven AOPs as an effective, scalable strategy for treating explosive-contaminated waters."

This framework integrates target analysis, database matching, homologue screening, molecular networking, and reaction library-based annotation of potential transformation products. Applied to the Liuyang River, a representative urban watershed in China, we identified 106 fluorinated compounds.

Among SAF production pathways, alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) stands out for its scalability, supported by abundant feedstock availability and a well-established bioethanol industry. However, significant reductions in SAF carbon intensity (CI) require the use of future feedstocks (e.g., cellulosic) whose adoption is hindered by high capital costs for feedstock processing and ethanol upgrading. Here, we evaluate the financial viability and environmental implications of integrating an ATJ SAF biorefinery within a petroleum refinery, utilizing miscanthus and switchgrass as example feedstocks. Three scenarios are evaluated: standalone (benchmark), colocated, and repurposing (coprocessing SAF within the petroleum refinery). Results show repurposing reduces baseline capital costs by 36% and SAF minimum selling price (MSP) by 12% to 8.14 USD·gal–1; the superior performance of repurposing is consistent across both feedstocks. Integration has a limited effect on SAF CI, which remains stable across scenarios, whereas using cellulosic feedstocks reduces CI by over 70% relative to corn, with baseline values of 17.01 g CO2e·MJ–1 for miscanthus and 12.23 g CO2e·MJ–1 for switchgrass.

Here, a modified passive air sampler was developed and used to characterize vertical profiles of typical hazardous polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) in near-ground microenvironments. Field measurements demonstrated significant vertical  changes for most target air pollutants within the 2–150 cm height range, with the relative difference  ranging from 1.1 to 40.0. The concentration of total PACs generally showed an increasing trend with height; however, the intensity of this vertical variation was closely linked to season, pollution levels, and photochemical activity, and it also varies among individual compounds. Children’s exposure to total BaPeq would be significantly overestimated, particularly during summer, with the overestimation ranging from 13% to 79%. This vertical heterogeneity implies that exposure assessment should not overlook the height-dependent variability of near-ground air pollution levels, and the sampling strategy employed in this study can be used to evaluate the vertical  variation of air pollutants across different microenvironments."

In particular, there exist limited to no direct measurements of the distances traveled by MP particles during atmospheric transport. This study builds on a previous study that measured the settling velocity of various shapes and sizes of MPs. The settling velocity was found to have a distinct linear relationship for each type and shape of MP rather than one predictable relationship based on MP size and shape. In the current study, MP particles were released into the airflow from a common point within a boundary layer wind tunnel at three different wind speeds to measure the distance to which the particles were dispersed downwind. Similar to the previous study, a common relationship was not found between distance traveled and MP size and shape. However, a strong power relationship was determined between distance traveled and settling velocity when normalized by the friction velocity, which reflects the shear within the turbulent flow. This outcome stresses the importance of developing a database of MP settling velocity values that is accurate and comprehensive. The relation is suitable for use for all shapes and sizes of MP and windspeeds, providing a convenient simplification for MP dispersion modeling."

However, their combined effect on the metabolome has not been evaluated. We investigated the effect of short-term coexposure to temperature and PM2.5 on metabolomic signatures and the potential roles of serum lipids and biomarkers using a repeated-measures study among Chinese women of childbearing age. We performed untargeted metabolomic profiling to quantify plasma metabolites. Data on temperature and PM2.5 exposures were estimated using a fused estimator. Serum lipids and biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation were detected. The independent and combined effects of temperature and PM2.5 were estimated using a linear mixed-effect model and quantile-based g-computation, respectively. Pathway analysis was conducted to identify perturbed metabolic pathways. Ten women provided 46 blood samples, from which 139 metabolites were quantified. Temperature and PM2.5 had independent effects on several metabolites and pathways. The largest positive and negative combined effects were observed for benzyl sulfate [β = 1.460, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.438, 2.481] and chenodeoxycholic acid glycine conjugate (β = −1.933, 95% CI: −3.473, −0.392), respectively. Co-exposure to temperature and PM2.5 perturbed four pathways, including biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids; phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis; linoleic acid metabolism; and phenylalanine metabolism. The metabolomic perturbations were mainly related to oxidative stress and the inflammatory response. We observed a positive combined effect of temperature and PM2.5 on interleukin-8. Our findings demonstrate that the metabolic mechanisms induced by temperature and PM2.5 involve oxidative stress and the inflammatory response and suggest that these metabolomic perturbations might promote an inflammatory response via release of interleukin-8."

Accurate submesoscale representation in ocean models is a current challenge due to rapidly evolving flow and lack of observations at suitable scales.

We use advanced data‐assimilation to demonstrate the impact of SWOT observations on circulation estimates in a high‐resolution hydrodynamic model of the East Australian Current. We show that assimilating SWOT data improves representation and prediction of the mesoscale motions, and improves representation (but not prediction) of the fine‐scale dynamics. Increased relative vorticity variance with SWOT assimilation is widespread in space and time (away from SWOT observations) and projected to depth. Using data observed by SWOT in a realistic ocean model, we show enhanced representation of ocean processes across scales, essential for improved ocean forecasts and projections."

However, the details of BrC photochemical aging are not fully understood. When exposed to UV radiation, the chemical composition and optical properties of BrC can change, influencing atmospheric radiative forcing. Previous studies suggested that water‐soluble BrC in clouds and fog initially experiences enhanced light absorption due to phenolic monomers forming dimers. However, the identities of dimers responsible for the enhancement have neither been identified nor quantified. This study investigates the direct photolysis of a few key phenolic compounds present in BrC under UVA and UVB radiation. In particular, vanillin was used as a model compound with an aim to identify and quantify divanillin, the dimer of vanillin, and evaluate its role in photo‐enhancement. Using liquid chromatography‐mass spectrometry and UV‐visible spectroscopy, we confirmed the formation of phenolic dimers during photolysis. Quantitative analysis of vanillin revealed that while phenolic homodimers formed under both UVA and UVB conditions, with yields peaking at approximately 10% after 5 min, their contribution to enhanced visible‐range absorption was minor (about 10%). Our observations indicate that not all dimers contribute equally to photo‐enhancement. While divanillin showed negligible absorbance, the demethylated dimer (dimer‐CH2 ${\text{CH}}_{2}$) correlated better with the observed optical changes. This suggests that differences in molecular structure and conjugation, rather than the dimer backbone alone, are critical for absorbance, highlighting the need to distinguish between different dimers and oligomers in atmospheric models."

The simulation of wet deposition of solutes, alongside precipitation rates, in the Community Atmosphere Model version 6 with Chemistry (CAM‐chem) has had limited previous evaluation leaving an opportunity to determine its accuracy in simulating precipitation chemistry. Here, we assessed the accuracy of 1° resolution CAM‐chem outputs of wet deposition over the contiguous U.S. (CONUS) from 2002 to 2022, comparing model outputs for observed equivalents of sulfate (SO42−), ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3−), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) wet deposition with long‐term records collected at hundreds of stations across CONUS. After evaluating the temporal, spatial, and quantile differences between modeled and observed wet deposition fluxes, we find the model captures long‐term and seasonal patterns but consistently overestimates NO3−, while underestimating SO42−, NH4+, and DOC wet deposition fluxes. Model‐measurement agreement improved at higher deposition flux quantiles and site‐specific alignment was strongest for NO3−, and moderate for SO42− and NH4+. Low model‐measurement agreement for DOC comparisons is likely due to focusing on aerosol contributions. Higher resolution model simulations (∼14 km) resulted in equivalent comparisons as the 1° model, suggesting that wet deposition processes are represented consistently across different model simulations and spatial resolution is not the main driver of inaccuracies of model deposition. Benchmarking modeled deposition outputs is crucial for evaluating CAM‐chem's performance and its utility in understanding landscape drivers of deposition chemistry within Earth system models."

Using all TC events from the North Atlantic and Western Pacific basins between 2020 and 2025, we assess the ability of two AI models (Pangu‐Weather and Aurora) to reproduce observed TC track density, climatology of storm characteristics, and physical consistency with TC theory. By comparing AI‐simulated TCs with ERA5 reanalysis, we benchmark the distributions of intensity, size, forward speed, and evaluate the model's ability to credibly simulate extratropical transition. Results show that both Pangu and Aurora perform well in reproducing storm track density, forward speed distribution, and outer size distribution. Aurora shows an improved performance in simulating storm intensity compared to Pangu, with less bias in the distribution of minimum central pressure and maximum wind speed. However, both models overestimate the distribution of storm inner size (radius of maximum winds), especially for extreme events. AI models capture the relative frequency and temporal evolution of extratropical transition patterns with reasonable accuracy. The AI‐simulated TCs are also less likely to conform to gradient wind balance compared to ERA5, indicating that the AI TCs may not be physically realistic in many cases. This benchmarking identifies systematic biases that can guide future corrections and support extended applications of AI models for TC hazard and risk assessment.

To better understand cold‐season variability, this study investigates the correlations between GL ETC thermodynamic characteristics and different global teleconnection patterns. Using a database of 886 cyclones identified in ERA5 data, we find that while there is no correlation between teleconnection indices and the number of GL ETCs each year, the Pacific North American and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) indices are significantly correlated with the moisture content in GL ETCs, and the North American Oscillation is correlated with ETC temperature. The Arctic Oscillation is correlated with all thermodynamic characteristics in GL ETCs. Additionally, the relationships between GL ETCs and teleconnection indices are shifting with time, and some teleconnections, like the NPGO, may become more influential to Great Lakes weather in the future."

Here, we show that the interannual variability of the summer sea fog over the mid‐latitude North Pacific region is correlated with the Asian‐Pacific Oscillation (APO) driven by the seasonal heating of the Tibetan Plateau. During the positive phase of APO, the sea fog frequency is observed to be higher along with a stronger North Pacific Subtropical High, North Pacific Trough and South Asian High, while the Bering Sea Low and Okhotsk High are weaker. The stronger northward heat and water vapor fluxes in the positive phase of APO associated with the North Pacific Subtropical High lead to a higher air temperature and relative humidity over the mid‐latitude North Pacific region. Additionally, this northward warm advection is stronger in the upper boundary layer than the cooling by the sea surface temperature in the lower layer, creating a temperature inversion within the marine boundary layer and hence a higher sea fog frequency over the mid‐latitude North Pacific region. Our study shows that the teleconnection of the Tibetan Plateau can be extended to the mid‐latitude northern Pacific through the North Pacific Subtropical High."

Here, we constructed a high‐resolution model for the Pacific Arctic Region (PAR) using the polar‐optimized Weather Research and Forecasting model (PWRF), applied it to simulate the low‐level atmosphere during the 2018 Chinese National Arctic Research Expedition (CHINARE‐2018), and were able to accurately reproduce the observed conditions. Simulations, combined with observational data, were used to evaluate and investigate extreme variations in inversions over the MIZ. Analysis of 84 observed inversions revealed that inversion variability increased significantly during cyclone passing, with a specific inversion of extreme variations occurring in the MIZ. Simulation results showed that abrupt sea ice transitions in the MIZ triggered boundary‐layer destabilization, setting it apart from other ice zones and leading to these extreme inversion variations. Before the abrupt sea ice transitions occurred, inversions were mainly controlled by warm advection induced by the cyclone, which facilitated the formation of low‐level clouds. Following the transitions, increased surface turbulent fluxes destabilized the boundary‐layer, triggering strong upward motion. Meanwhile, accumulated moisture and energy promoted convection, lifting the clouds and inversions. Adiabatic cooling and radiative cooling at the cloud‐top over the MIZ led to the formation of inversions reaching the highest altitudes and lowest temperatures during CHINARE‐2018, fully capping the cloud‐top."

This assimilative causal inference enables online detection of instantaneous causal relationships and reveals how causal influence propagates temporally. 
 Causal inference is fundamental across scientific disciplines, yet existing methods struggle to capture instantaneous, time-evolving causal relationships in complex, high-dimensional systems. In this paper, assimilative causal inference (ACI) is developed, which is a methodological framework that leverages Bayesian data assimilation to trace causes backward from observed effects. ACI solves the inverse problem rather than quantifying forward influence. It uniquely identifies dynamic causal interactions without requiring observations of candidate causes, accommodates short datasets, and, in principle, can be implemented in high-dimensional settings by employing efficient data assimilation algorithms. Crucially, it provides online tracking of causal roles that may reverse intermittently and facilitates a mathematically rigorous criterion for the causal influence range, revealing how far effects propagate. The effectiveness of ACI is demonstrated by complex dynamical systems showcasing intermittency and extreme events. ACI opens valuable pathways for studying complex systems, where transient causal structures are critical. The authors develop a framework that uses data assimilation to trace causes backwards from observed effects, even with partial observations. This assimilative causal inference enables online detection of instantaneous causal relationships and reveals how causal influence propagates temporally."

 Ocean fronts are critical features that influence marine ecosystems and can affect climate at both regional and global scales. In many regions, fronts enhance vertical mixing and advection, increasing nutrient supply, which can stimulate primary production and modulate air–sea CO2 fluxes. However, a global perspective on the impacts of changing ocean fronts on primary production and air–sea CO2 exchange is still lacking. Here using satellite observations (2003–2024) and supplementary reanalysis data at higher latitudes (2003–2024), we identify areas with the richest frontal activity and the fastest-changing frontal properties. We find that 72% of global ocean CO2 uptake occurs in key frontal areas. Trends in sea surface chlorophyll concentration and ocean CO2 uptake closely track changes in local frontal activity. Our results indicate that ocean fronts play a central role in regulating the global carbon cycle by influencing the biological component of air–sea CO2 fluxes.

 Anomalously unradiogenic neodymium in authigenic phases of the North Atlantic during glacial terminations has been attributed to weathering of glacial sediments derived from shield rocks. However, mechanisms producing unradiogenic neodymium and their link to terrestrial processes remain poorly constrained. Here we analyze neodymium isotopes from co-located stream water and sediment across a deglaciating landscape in southwest Greenland. Dissolved neodymium is ~8 ɛNd units less radiogenic than bedload in recently exposed watersheds. In watersheds with longer exposure time, dissolved neodymium is ~10 ɛNd units and particulate neodymium ~3 ɛNd units higher, decreasing the offset to ~1 unit. This shift results from preferential weathering of minerals with low samarium/neodymium ratios and winnowing of the fine fraction of recently exposed sediments. Variations in the influx and weathering extent of shield-derived sediment alter neodymium isotopic compositions of North Atlantic seafloor sediment and seawater, constraining interpretations of past ice sheet loss and deep ocean circulation.

 The Cd concentrations and isotope compositions of open ocean surface waters are generally thought to be governed by internal cycling, and particularly by the balance between upwelling of more Cd-rich deeper water masses and Cd uptake by phytoplankton. Here we present a new dataset of coupled Cd isotope compositions and concentrations for seawater depth profiles sampled in the western tropical Atlantic Ocean during Leg 2 of the GEOTRACES GA02 section. A box model for the Cd source and sink fluxes of the oligotrophic surface waters of the study area shows that the observed light Cd isotope compositions and low Cd concentrations are a consequence of biological Cd uptake and atmospheric deposition of isotopically light anthropogenic Cd. Aerosols enriched in anthropogenic Cd thereby contributed at least 19%, and possibly more than 45%, to the dissolved surface water Cd inventory during the sampling period. This reveals that anthropogenic emissions of volatile Cd can have a key impact on the distribution of Cd in open ocean surface waters.

 Countries worldwide are pursuing efficient and clean energy extraction. In China, coal bases have implemented green mining policies for over a decade, but their environmental impact remains poorly understood. Here we compile raw coal production data and green mining policy records from 14 coal bases between 2004 and 2021 to estimate carbon emissions and quantify policy intensity. We assess the effect of these policies on emissions and find that, following national green mining initiatives, policy intensity increased more than tenfold, coinciding with a substantial reduction or slowdown in carbon emissions from raw coal production. Implementation of these policies is estimated to have reduced total emissions by 43.59 million tons annually. Differences in policy design, enforcement capacity, and technological foundations contribute to variability in emission reductions. These results demonstrate the critical role of policy interventions in guiding coal-dependent regions toward effective climate governance and provide insights for designing more scientifically grounded strategies to achieve cleaner and more efficient energy production.

 The formation of cloud condensation nuclei is a critical but uncertain factor in Arctic climate dynamics. A major nuclei contributor is new particle formation, yet the geographical variations in activity and the factors driving it remain poorly understood. Here, we present a nine-year (2010–2018) analysis of atmospheric particle number size distributions from Tiksi, Russia, integrated with air mass trajectory modelling and ocean remote sensing. We show that aerosol formation rates are significantly enhanced—particle formation rates increase by 300% and growth rates by 60%—when air masses travel over regions of the Arctic Ocean with high concentrations of terrigenous dissolved organic matter from river runoff. Using multiple analytical approaches, we identify terrigenous dissolved organic matter rich waters as key source regions for aerosol formation, likely driven by the oxidation of biotic and abiotic volatile organic compounds emitted from the air–ocean interface. We note that most atmospheric measurements are conducted far from Arctic River deltas, despite 11% of the ice-free Arctic Ocean being influenced by high terrigenous dissolved organic matter concentrations.

The enhancement is dominated by clear-sky-only forcing changes and less severe in cloudier and windier periods. Persistent incoming shortwave radiation enhancements on the order of 5-11 Wm−2 likely lead to sea-surface temperature increases of 0.05-0.15 °C, implying that during bleaching-conducive conditions, 5-10% additional thermal stress is felt by GBR corals now than before the regulation of ship sulfate emissions. Reduced sulfate aerosols due to ship fuel regulation may increase shortwave radiation on the Great Barrier Reef, exacerbating the impact of marine heatwaves on coral bleaching, according to model analysis of ship emission impacts on aerosols, clouds and solar radiation."

 This study harnesses quality-assured global Pandora observations (2019–2023) from the Pandonia Global Network (PGN) to investigate diurnal and seasonal variations of NO2 and HCHO—key proxies for tropospheric O3—and to evaluate TROPOMI satellite observations. NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) at Polluted Urban stations peak in winter and gradually increase throughout the day, but show a decrease in afternoons in summer due to photochemical loss. Conversely, Rural/Background stations exhibit summer maxima with monotonic daytime increases across seasons, driven by stratospheric NO2 variability. HCHO VCDs are higher in summer at most sites, with a morning increase followed by elevated concentrations throughout the afternoon. The spatial representativeness mismatch between satellite and Pandora observations results in negative biases in TROPOMI NO2 VCDs at Polluted Urban stations and a valley station, while overestimations are found at high-altitude stations. Considerable random uncertainties in TROPOMI HCHO VCDs lead to low correlations (r2 = 0.08–0.11) and high random errors (0.27–0.33 DU) across environments. Averaging collocated data points prior to intercomparison effectively reduces random biases, whereas increasing the spatial collocation range introduces biases due to spatial averaging effects. Tropospheric HCHO-to-NO2 ratios (FNRtrop) retrieved from Pandora observations indicate that Polluted Urban (0.82 ± 0.08) and Rural/Background (1.64 ± 0.07) stations are generally under VOC-limited and NOx-limited O3 production regimes, respectively, while summertime increases in FNRtrop put Polluted Urban stations in a transitional range, yielding higher O3 production efficiencies. TROPOMI-derived FNRtrop shows good agreement with Pandora in Polluted Urban stations (ΔFNRmedian = 0.18), whereas random error increases in rural areas with lower tropospheric NO2."

 Accurate and timely information on rice cultivation areas and cropping intensity is essential for precision crop management, food security and environmental sustainability. However, the generation of high-quality rice products is often hindered by the lack of ground truth samples, particularly in the regions with complex cropping patterns. While most rice mapping methods rely on the use of remotely sensed flooding signal from the transplanting period to distinguish rice from other crops, they face significant challenges from the increasingly prevalent direct-seeded rice for which the flooding signal at the beginning of season is weak due to the unique management measures. To address these issues and achieve the comprehensive extraction of rice under diverse cropping patterns and establishment methods, this study proposed the phenological knowledge-guided automatic rice mapping approach using optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data (PHAROS). This method first determined the cropping intensity of rice and its concurrent crops using harmonized multi-resource Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series and phenological knowledge. Subsequently, the Double Phase SAR Index (DPSI) was constructed to extract candidate rice samples by synthesizing the early and peak growth phases retrieved from NDVI time series and the corresponding SAR polarization features. Consequently, training data were generated automatically and fed into a machine learning classifier for rice mapping. The effectiveness of the PHAROS was evaluated over the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River (MLRYR) of China and four other major rice production regions in Asia. Furthermore, the earliest timing of early, middle and late rice in the MLRYR was also quantified via the PHAROS and cross-year model transfer.The results demonstrated that the PHAROS could identify rice of diverse cropping pattern with an overall accuracy (OA) from 0.965 to 0.976 in the MLRYR from 2019 to 2023. The classification maps exhibited well-delineated rice parcels and clear separation between single- and double-cropping rice. The PHAROS also yielded OA values of 0.902–0.979 and similar distribution pattern with the reference rice products in Suihua of China, Sataka of Japan, An Giang of Vietnam and Punjab of Pakistan, which represent diverse climatic conditions and cropping patterns across Asia. Compared to its counterpart methods, PHAROS demonstrated significant improvements by 0.022–0.235 in OA in rice planting area extraction and cropping intensity detection. The early, middle and late rice could be identified as early as at tillering, tillering-jointing and sowing/transplanting stages, respectively. This study reveals the necessity of handling the overlooked weak flooding signal from direct-seeded rice and offers a viable solution for large-scale rice cropping intensity detection and mapping under diverse establishment methods."

 Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images are widely used in land cover mapping, environmental monitoring, and disaster management. While optical sensors are often hindered by adverse weather conditions such as clouds and rain, SAR provides all-weather capability but suffers from lower interpretability. To overcome this limitation, historical optical data can be leveraged to improve SAR interpretation and enhance mapping accuracy. This study proposed a degradable multimodal fusion (DEMFuse) framework that leverages historical optical data to enhance the interpretation of single SAR imagery and implemented it via semantic segmentation. The DEMFuse is composed of a SAR-to-optical image generator and a degradable fusion model. The former was built upon an ImageNet-pretrained transformer that employed a non-local generative modeling for translating SAR images into optical images to recover optical visual structural information. The latter was proposed to achieve progressively enhanced fusion performance by continuously assimilating useful information from synthesized optical data based on SAR data, thus reducing the impact of artifacts in the synthesized data, and ensuring the effective fusion of the optical and SAR data. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DEMFuse framework, a globally distributed SAR-to-optical image translation dataset and a land-cover semantic segmentation dataset were constructed by using 18,071 Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical images, together referred to as “IT-SS-18 K” (image translation-segmentation-18 K). Additionally, a SAR-based flood rapid mapping dataset was employed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in disaster scenarios. Experiments on IT-SS-18 K demonstrated that the proposed DEMFuse framework significantly reduced the relative accuracy gap by over 30 % between SAR and optical data for the segmentation of water, built areas, and trees. In the flood disaster scenario, the proposed framework yielded a 1.76 % improvement compared to the single SAR segmentation. This finding suggests that DEMFuse can be employed to enhance SAR interpretation in scenarios where optical data is missing, and improve the efficiency and accuracy of disaster management and environmental monitoring.

 Landslides are among the most frequent natural hazards worldwide, posing severe risks to human lives and assets. Sentinel-2 imagery, a widely available remote sensing resource, has become an essential tool for detecting landslide changes. Nevertheless, its moderate spatial resolution often causes the loss of subtle surface information, which limits the precision of landslide recognition. To overcome this limitation, this study develops a Dynamic Multi-branch Landslide Change Detection Network (DMLCDNet) that integrates three types of multimodal data: multispectral, deformation, and topographic information. The proposed model achieves efficient landslide extraction through four key stages: preliminary change detection, dynamic feature extraction, feature fusion optimization, and spatial-semantic restoration. Experiments were conducted on three representative landslide events—Jiuzhaigou, Luding, and Longyan. The experimental findings indicate that DMLCDNet achieves improvements of 3.61% in F1-score and 6.91% in IoU over all baseline models, while sustaining efficient inference performance. In addition, evaluations on two other landslide cases confirm the model’s robust generalization ability. The study further emphasizes that the optimal selection of input data should follow three guiding principles: rich information, high discriminability, and strong relevance. Overall, the proposed method provides an effective paradigm for multisource feature fusion in Sentinel-2–based landslide change detection, offering substantial theoretical significance and practical value.

 Coastal regions worldwide are increasingly threatened by Relative Sea Level Rise (RSLR), which results from the combined effects of Sea Level Rise (SLR) and Vertical Land Motion (VLM). Satellite Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) can measure millimeter-scale VLM. However, the spatiotemporal variability of VLM remains poorly quantified in RSLR estimation and projection and flood inundation assessment. This study constructed an RSLR dataset for the Bohai Rim by integrating high-resolution InSAR-derived VLM with SLR. We develop a dynamic flood inundation model by incorporating hydrological connectivity and flow path attenuation factors to improve flood risk assessment. The results show significant spatial variability of VLM and concentration on muddy and sandy coastlines. VLM dominates the spatial patterns and magnitude of RSLR. The maximum inundation extent and depth reach 17,756 km2 and 5.4 m, respectively, under the RSLR-SSP5-8.5 scenario by 2100, which threatens 10.4 million residents. The uncertainties in inundation projection can be reduced by considering the drivers and nonlinear evolution of VLM. The flood protection infrastructures can reduce inundation largely. Our findings highlight the crucial importance of incorporating VLM into coastal risk assessments and provide insights for RSLR adaptation strategies."

 BackgroundGlobally, the increasing frequency of extreme heat events and ozone pollution incidents has significantly intensified public health risks. However, empirical evidence regarding their synergistic impacts remains limited in central China.MethodsA two-stage analysis was conducted using data from 121 counties in Henan (2013–2019). Quasi-Poisson generalized additive models were used to assess county-specific associations, adjusting for PM2.5, RH, and temporal trends. The combined effect of air temperature (non-linear) and ozone (linear) was captured through multiplicative interaction terms. Random-effects meta-analyses were applied to pool the results. Subgroup analyses examined differences by age, sex, marital status, and cause of death.ResultsDuring the study period, 1,280,429 deaths were recorded. Both high temperatures and elevated ozone levels were associated with increased mortality. Their joint effects were stronger than individual exposures. At high ozone levels, mortality risk increased by 2 percentage points (from 9.3 % to 11.3 %) between temperature distribution percentiles 75th and 99th. Under high-temperature conditions (31.4 °C, 90th percentile), a 10 μg/m3 elevation in ozone was associated with a 0.94 % (95 % CI: 0.49 %–1.38 %) increase in mortality. Older adults, females, other marital statuses (including unmarried, divorced, or widowed), and those with cardiovascular or respiratory diseases were more susceptible to its effects.ConclusionHigh temperature and ozone synergistically increase mortality risk.

 Coupling effects among different components of atmospheric particulate matter (PM) may influence the oxidative potential (OP) of PM, whereas the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we investigate the OP of binary organics/inorganics mixtures, typically present in PM, using a dithiothreitol assay under dark conditions. The binary mixture of 2-methoxyphenol (2-MET, a typical biomass burning marker) and FeCl3 shows a 23 times increase in OP (380 pmol min−1·μg−1) compared to the individual species. A synergistic mechanism has been revealed through comprehensive characterization of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and relevant intermediates, by ROS probe technology, spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry indicates that diphenyl-p-benzoquinones, like 5,5′-dihydroxy-3,3′-dimethoxy-[1,1′-bi(cyclohexane)]-2,2′,5,5′-tetraene-4,4′-dione‌, can be produced in the presence of Fe3+, subsequently promoting ROS formation (·OH and ·O2−) through free radical chain reaction induced by semiquinone. The OP achieves a maximum when the mass ratio of 2-MET to FeCl3 is 1.0 at 37°C. It persists around 60% of the initial OP over 31 h, which indicates the possible contribution of the mixture of methoxyphenol and Fe(III) to environmental persistent free radicals in the atmosphere. Our findings provide a new insight into the non-linear dependence of PM oxidative toxicity on composition and meaningful guidance for future PM health risk reduction."

 Two flash heavy rainfalls (FHRs) with short and extremely persistent durations during July 4–6, 2017 consecutively attacked the Sichuan Basin in China with breaking historical precipitation records. Based on multi-source precipitation datasets including rain gauge stations, satellite-based products, and reanalysis datasets, the two FHRs are thoroughly investigated in this study. High resolution numerical simulations are performed to analyze and compare the key mechanisms and diurnal characteristics between the two FHRs, together with other analytical techniques such as Barnes filtering and ageostrophic wind diagnostic equation. It is found that the precipitating event was dominated by combined effects of a low-level jet (LLJ) and the southwest vortex. Similarities and differences between the two FHRs are analyzed and concluded from the perspective of their key driving mechanisms. During the first FHR with short durations, geostrophic winds progressively intensified, while low-level southeasterlies underwent topographic convergence and uplifted over the northwestern basin. Under the background of weak geostrophic wind variations, the ageostrophic wind vector in the second FHR with extremely persistent durations exhibited pronounced clockwise diurnal rotation. Enhanced nocturnal southerlies poured moisture convergence into the basin, driving nighttime precipitation intensification. Steep basin-edge topography strengthened boundary layer friction (BLF) and intensified easterly ageostrophic winds. This deflection steered the LLJ southeastward, effectively channeling moisture into the storm area. Post-dawn enhancement of boundary layer friction increased ageostrophic moisture flux, slowing the precipitation decay rate. The inertial oscillation of ageostrophic winds critically governed the nocturnal enhancement and daytime suppression of rainfall by modulating moisture transport phases. Additionally, the post-dawn increase in boundary layer friction altered spatiotemporal configurations between ageostrophic winds and the LLJ, forming a key factor in precipitation process asymmetry."

 MEDIterranean hurriCANES (Medicanes) represent a subcategory of Mediterranean cyclones that typically originate as extratropical systems then acquiring characteristics similar to tropical cyclones (TCs). These include the warm core, a nearly symmetric near-surface wind circulation, and eye-like features with spiraling rainbands. This study employs satellite scatterometer data to analyse ocean near-surface wind field in order to detect the rotational center by means the newly developed Medicane Rotational Center Automated Detection (MeRCAD) algorithm. As for TCs, the radius of maximum wind (RMW) is defined as the distance between the rotational center and the area of maximum wind. Results show a significant decrease in RMW, often down to a few tens of kilometres, when the wind field is featured by a nearly symmetric circulation. This allows wind features to be used as an indicator of the possible transition to the mature stage. We also found that the maximum sustained wind associated with the medicanes' mature phase is mostly beyond 95th percentile of values observed for all Mediterranean cyclones, although they appear substantially weaker than TCs. In addition, if the tropical transition occurs, the warm core is fueled by an area of deep convection that may be located near the rotational center at distances shorter than the RMW. However, the presence of an almost symmetrical wind circulation alone is insufficient to indicate the occurrence of the mature phase, due to the possible lack of a warm core. Vice versa, the warm core may occur without the characteristic nearly-symmetric wind circulation."

 Organic aerosols (OA) are key components of wintertime urban haze, but the relationship between their oxidation state and volatility – critical for understanding aerosol evolution and improving model predictions – remains poorly constrained. While oxidation–volatility decoupling has been observed in laboratory studies, field-based evidence under real-world conditions is scarce, particularly during severe haze episodes. This study presents a field-based investigation of OA sources and their volatility characteristics in Seoul during a winter haze period, using a thermodenuder coupled with a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS).Positive matrix factorization resolved six OA factors: hydrocarbon-like OA, cooking, biomass burning, nitrogen-containing OA (NOA), less-oxidized oxygenated OA (LO-OOA), and more-oxidized OOA (MO-OOA). Despite having the highest oxygen-to-carbon ratio (∼1.15), MO-OOA exhibited unexpectedly high volatility, indicating a decoupling between oxidation state and volatility. We attribute this to fragmentation-driven aging and autoxidation under stagnant conditions with limited OH exposure. In contrast, LO-OOA showed lower volatility and more typical oxidative behavior.Additionally, NOA – a rarely resolved factor in wintertime field studies – was prominent during cold, humid, and stagnant conditions and exhibited chemical and volatility features similar to biomass burning OA, suggesting a shared combustion origin and meteorological sensitivity.These findings provide one of the few field-based demonstrations of oxidation–volatility decoupling in ambient OA and highlight how source-specific properties and meteorology influence OA evolution.

Organic aerosols (OA) showed a dominant contribution (46.2 %) to PM1 followed by sulfate (20.8 %), black carbon (19.4 %), ammonium (8.5 %), nitrate (4.8 %) and chloride (0.4 %). Evolution of bulk OA in the f44 vs. f60 space showed clear aging process from less aged BB plumes to highly oxidized state in polluted period. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) on the high-resolution organic mass spectra resolved two oxygenated OA (OOA) factors, i.e., a less-oxidized OOA influenced by biomass burning (OOA-BB) and a more-oxidized OOA (MO-OOA). We performed a case study to explore the OOA formation mechanism during long-range transport. The results indicated aqueous-phase process and photochemical reaction together elevated OOA concentrations and aging processing, consistent with secondary inorganic aerosol production. This study underscores the significant occurrence of BB aerosols in Himalayas and provides insights into the oxidative processing in this remote region."

Pope;Yuqing Dai;Zongbo Shi,Enhancing Accuracy of Indoor Air Quality Sensors via Automated Machine Learning Calibration,"We developed a multi-stage AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) calibration framework to improve low-cost indoor PM2.5 sensor accuracy. Using chamber tests with varied emission sources, the method corrected drift, humidity effects, and non-linear responses, raising R2 above 0.9 and halving RMSE (Root Mean Square Error). The approach enables reliable, scalable indoor air quality monitoring for research and public health applications. 
 Indoor fine particles (PM2.5) exposure poses significant public health risks, prompting growing use of low-cost sensors for indoor air quality monitoring. However, maintaining data accuracy from these sensors is challenging, due to interference of environmental conditions, such as humidity, and instrument drift. Calibration is essential to ensure the accuracy of these sensors. This study introduces a novel automated machine learning (AutoML)-based calibration framework to enhance the reliability of low-cost indoor PM2.5 measurements. The multi-stage calibration framework connects low-cost field sensors to be deployed with intermediate drift-correction reference sensors and a reference-grade instrument, applying separate calibration models for low (clean air environment) and high (pollution events) concentration ranges. We evaluated the framework in a controlled indoor chamber using two different sensor models exposed to diverse indoor pollution sources under uncontrolled natural ambient conditions. The AutoML-driven calibration significantly improved sensor performance, achieving a strong correlation with reference measurements (R2 > 0.90) and substantially reducing error metrics (with normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) and symmetric mean absolute percentage error (sMAPE) roughly halved relative to uncalibrated data). Bias was effectively minimised, yielding calibrated readings closely aligned with the reference instrument. These findings demonstrate that our calibration strategy can convert low-cost sensors into a more reliable tool for indoor air pollution monitoring. The improved data quality supports atmospheric science research by enabling more accurate indoor PM2.5 monitoring, and informs public health interventions and evaluation by facilitating better indoor exposure assessment."

This study adapted the flux plane mass balance method to a rapidly deployable, operationally flexible, and user-friendly, human-portable telescoping pole-based system. Controlled release test results suggest that the pole method can be applied to moderate height sources at closer downwind distances with performance similar to other widely used mobile quantification methods. 
 Quantifying methane (CH4) emissions from anthropogenic sources is essential for compliance, inventory, and verification efforts. One established mass balance approach is the mobile flux plane method, in which emissions can be estimated from measurements of CH4 at various heights. Most traditional applications require either a drone or aircraft, both of which can be expensive, or limiting to deploy in all situations. To broaden applicability and improve practicality, we adapted the flux plane method using a long telescoping pole and backpack-mounted CH4 sensor. We explored accuracy through 44 controlled release experiments (0.2–5.6 kg CH4 h−1) from a 2.4 m stack. Measurements were taken at 6 heights (0.8–5.6 m) by walking transects 10–30 m downwind. The data yielded a mean relative error of −10.1 %, with 68 % of estimates within ±38.3 % of true values. Results are comparable to drone-based methods. We also tested an optimized Gaussian plume model using partial vertical profiles to address issues where the pole could not measure the top of the plume. This approach was slightly less precise than the flux plane method and had less bias. Overall, results show that multi-level, telescoping pole-based CH4 measurements combined with flux plane or Gaussian models can (i) quantify emissions from elevated sources in a logistically practical manner with results comparable to other widely used mobile quantification methods, and (ii) quantify sources emitting CH4 at low rates owing to the close-range capability of the method, complementing other mobile methods such as vehicle-based systems, aircraft, and satellites that generally measure higher-emitting sources."

Using approximately 2000 aerial photographs from the year 1989 over the western Antarctic Peninsula and nearby islands, we created detailed elevation models and orthoimages that have high accuracy compared to recent satellite data. This open dataset aids tracking historical ice loss and its role in sea level rise. 
 We present a unique, timestamped, high-resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and orthomosaic dataset, derived from aerial imagery that covers about 12 000 km2 area on the western Antarctic Peninsula and surrounding islands between 66–68° S. We used a film-based aerial image archive from 1989 acquired by the Institut für Angewandte Geodäsie (IfAG), which is kept in the Archive for German Polar Research at the Alfred Wegener Institute, Germany, to generate the historical DEMs and orthoimages. The reference elevation model of Antarctica (REMA) mosaic is used as a reference DEM to co-register our historical product on stable ground. We evaluated the vertical accuracy of the derived IfAG DEM with independent surface elevation data from ICESat-2 from the summer months of 2020 and 2021. Our historical DEMs have vertical accuracies better than 6 and 8 m with respect to modern elevation data, REMA, and ICESat-2, respectively. The late 20th century DEM and orthomosaic are very valuable observations in a data sparse region, and this dataset will help to quantify historical ice volume changes and inform geodetic mass balance estimates.

Many compounds were both emitted and deposited depending on the season and time of day. Emissions peaked in summer, while uptake was stronger in autumn. This unique long-term dataset improves our understanding of forest–atmosphere interactions and supports better air quality and climate models. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and ozone (O3) are key constituents of tropospheric chemistry, affecting both air quality and climate. Forests are major emitters of biogenic VOCs (BVOCs), yet large uncertainties remain regarding the diversity of exchanged compounds, the drivers of their bidirectional fluxes, and their in-canopy chemistry. Long-term and comprehensive in situ datasets remain scarce, limiting our understanding of these complex processes. We conducted a 3-year field campaign (2022–2024) at the Integrated Carbon Observation System mixed temperate forest station of Vielsalm (BE-Vie), combining vertical concentration profile and eddy covariance flux measurements above and below the canopy (concentration dataset: https://doi.org/10.18758/NVFBA74V, Verreyken et al., 2025c; flux dataset: https://doi.org/10.18758/KHV8ZXU2, Dumont et al., 2025a; concentration-turbulence profile dataset: https://doi.org/10.18758/BED4Q2VY, Dumont et al., 2025b). Using a PTR-ToF-MS and an open-source data-processing workflow, we identified 48 significantly exchanged VOCs. The vertical and diurnal gradients of the mixing ratios reflected the interplay between emission, deposition, chemistry, and transport. Combined with a profile of turbulence statistics, these observations offer an opportunity to investigate their behaviour within the canopy. The forest acted as a net VOC source in summer (∼ 1.25 µg m−2 s−1), while deposition dominated in autumn. Many oxygenated VOCs displayed bidirectional exchange. Monoterpenes, isoprene, and methanol were the most abundant flux contributors, but 15–30 (30–43) compounds were needed to account for 90 % of total emissions (depositions), depending on the season. Below-canopy BVOC and O3 fluxes reached ∼ 10 % of above-canopy ones, with proportionally enhanced below-canopy ozone uptake at night. This study provides one of the most detailed long-term datasets of VOC and O3 exchange in a temperate forest and serves as a key reference for improving process-based models of biogenic, physical, and chemical exchange in forest ecosystems."

It merges satellite and reanalysis products using a statistical uncertainty-based framework that minimizes reliance on gauge observations, making it particularly suitable for data-sparse regions. Evaluation using over 5,000 independent gauges shows that SUPER v2 achieves higher accuracy than existing products, supporting global drought monitoring and hydrological modeling. 
 The Statistical Uncertainty analysis-based Precipitation mERging (SUPER) methodology can optimally merge different precipitation datasets with minimal use of ground-based information and is therefore better suited for data-sparse regions. Although a proof-of-concept SUPER framework has already been introduced previously, it contains substantial uncertainties and is only available at a daily timescale, which is inadequate for land surface modeling. In response, we present here a new 3-hourly, 0.1-degree, global SUPER version 2 (v2) dataset, spanning 2000–2023. SUPER v2 is unique in three key aspects: i) it optimizes the number of input precipitation datasets, which reduces data redundancy and mitigates negative biases in extreme precipitation events; ii) it optimally evaluates its internal merging weights and filters out false-alarmed events without reliance on extensive gauge networks; and iii) it employs a multi-scale (i.e., monthly–daily–3-hourly) temporal correction/merging procedure that enhances the robustness of precipitation estimates. The SUPER v2 product is comprehensively evaluated using 5,972 independent gauges. Results show that it has a root-mean-squared-error of 3.64 mm d−1 and correlation coefficient of 0.68 [-] for daily precipitation estimates. These error metrics outperform traditional approaches over 81 % to 86 % of the validation gauges. The superiority of SUPER v2 with regards to rain/no-rain classification skill is even more evident, with Heidke’s Skill Score 22 % higher than commonly used datasets. Similar findings are also demonstrated in the 3-hourly SUPER v2 precipitation dataset. As such, SUPER v2 provides a unique opportunity for enhancing global-scale hydrology and land surface modeling — particularly for data sparse regions."

However, their assimilation has traditionally focused on retrieved profiles. This study implemented the direct assimilation of brightness temperatures from GMWRs with a machine learning-based bias correction scheme. The results show improvements in the low-level atmospheric structure and precipitation predictions. 
 The application of ground-based microwave radiometers (GMWRs), which provide high-quality and continuous vertical atmospheric observations, has traditionally focused on the indirect assimilation of retrieved profiles. This study advanced this application by developing a direct assimilation capability for GMWR radiance observations within the Weather Research and Forecasting Data Assimilation (WRFDA) system, along with a bias correction scheme based on the random forest technique. The proposed bias correction scheme effectively reduced the observation-minus-background (O−B) biases and standard deviations by 0.83 K (97.1 %) and 1.63 K (64.6 %), respectively. A series of 10 d experiments demonstrated that assimilating GMWR radiances improves both the initial conditions and the forecasts, with additional benefits from higher assimilation frequencies. In the initial conditions, hourly assimilation significantly enhanced low-level temperature and humidity fields, reducing the root-mean-square error (RMSE) for temperature by 6.32 % below 1 km and for water vapor mixing ratio by 1.98 % below 5 km. These improvements extended to forecasts, where 2 m temperature and humidity showed sustained benefits for over 12 h, and precipitation forecasts exhibited improvements to a certain extent. The time-averaged Fractions Skill Score (FSS) for 3 h accumulated precipitation within the 24 h forecasts increased by 0.02–0.04 (3.9 %–10.2 %) for thresholds of 3–6 mm."

However, models do a poor job of simulating the QBO in the lower stratosphere, for reasons that remain unclear. One possibility is that models do not completely represent how ozone influences the QBO-associated wind variations. Here we propose a multi-model framework for assessing how ozone influences the QBO in recent past and future climates. 
 The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) is the main mode of variability in the tropical stratosphere, influencing the predictability of other regions in the atmosphere through its teleconnections to the stratospheric polar vortices and coupling to surface tropical and extratropical variability.  However, climate and forecasting models consistently underestimate QBO amplitudes in the lower stratosphere, likely contributing to their failure to simulate these teleconnections. One underexplored contributor to model biases is missing representation of ozone-radiative feedbacks, which enhance temperature variability in the lower stratosphere, particularly at periods at and greater than the QBO (>28 months). While previous studies suggest that ozone-radiative feedbacks can impact QBO periods, amplitudes and the associated secondary circulation in the lower stratosphere, the reported impacts differ widely among models and are hard to interpret due to differences in methodology. To this end, here we propose a coordinated experimental protocol – held joint between the Atmospheric Processes and their Role in Climate (APARC) Quasi-Biennial Oscillation Initiative (QBOi) and Chemistry Climate Modeling Initiative (CCMI) activities – which is aimed at assessing the coupling between stratospheric ozone, temperature and the circulation. We use the proposed experiments to define the ozone feedback on the QBO in both present-day and idealized (abrupt quadrupling of carbon dioxide) climates. While primary focus is on the QBO, the proposed protocol also enables analysis of other aspects of ozone-radiative-dynamical coupling in the atmosphere, including impacts on the Brewer-Dobson Circulation and tropospheric eddy-driven jet responses to future climate change. Here we document the scientific rationale and design of the QUOCA Phase 1 experiments, summarize the data request, and give a brief overview of participating models. Preliminary results using the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies E2-2 climate model are used to illustrate sensitivities to certain methodological choices."

Here, we measured the N2 fixation rates of isolated Microcystis colonies, free-living plankton, and the whole plankton community during dense Microcystis blooms over a three year period in six diverse lakes across eastern North America including Lake Erie. For five of six lakes, rates within the colony fraction were greater than the rates measured for free-living plankton (p < 0.05). N2 fixation rates were inversely correlated with the rates of ammonium uptake by the colony fraction (p < 0.05), and in experiments, ammonium significantly reduced N2 fixation rates within the colony fraction by 50–85% (p < 0.001). In several lakes, the δ15N of isolated colonies was lower (p < 0.05) than that of free-living plankton presumably due to the preferential use of 14N2 by diazotrophic, colony-associated plankton. Cyanobacterial and noncyanobacterial nifH sequences were associated with the Microcystis colonies with the nifH-based diversity of both groups being lower in colonies compared to free-living plankton. Compared to nitrate, ammonium, and urea uptake, N2 fixation rates accounted for 1–76% of total N assimilation by the Microcystis colony fraction and averaged 18% across systems, suggesting this process could support the proliferation of Microcystis blooms."

Herein, NCPs from different lake waters were extracted, with source- and concentration-dependent heterogeneities in formation potential, microheterogeneous distribution, and mechanism for •OH being explored. NCPs were composed of inorganic colloidal particles (ICPs) and organic colloidal particles (OCPs), and NCPs-mediated •OH was divided into free •OH and bound •OH. Results showed that, regardless of NCP sources and concentrations, apparent quantum yields of free •OH were 1.22–5.24 times lower than those of bound •OH, indicating high production potential and microheterogeneous distribution. It was indicated that ICPs primarily contributed to the production of bound •OH, while OCPs were the main components responsible for free •OH generation. Furthermore, water oxidation by valence band holes in ICPs acted as the primary pathway for bound •OH formation, while oxygen-mediated chain reactions driven by excited triplet states and superoxide anions contributed to free •OH formation. The microheterogeneous distribution of •OH exhibited distinct attenuation rates toward aquatic contaminants. This study highlights NCPs as important photochemical •OH sources that significantly influence the behaviors and fate of nutrients and contaminants in aquatic ecosystems."

However, it is not well characterized how the mixture of dissolved organic contaminants in rivers evolves longitudinally from source to mouth or how it is related to river catchment characteristics. We collected dry-weather water samples along two large, anthropogenically impacted German rivers, the Neckar and Spree, and used target and nontarget analyses to assess the concentration patterns of individual organic contaminants as well as the peak area patterns of nontarget anthropogenic features and the remaining nontarget “other” features. 81% of the target contaminants, 66% of the anthropogenic features, and 56% of the “other” features were detected in at least 50% of sites in both river catchments, indicating a high degree of chemical similarity despite catchment spatial separation. Contaminant concentrations and feature peak areas increased within and downstream of urbanized regions. Pharmaceuticals correlated most strongly with the annual volume of treated wastewater effluent in a catchment, whereas polymer-related chemicals correlated most strongly with urban land covers linked to industry and transportation. Feature-based molecular networks of sartans, hexa(methoxymethyl)melamine derivatives, and polyethylene glycols revealed a multitude of contaminants in the rivers that would be overlooked if relying on target or nontarget annotation methods alone.

Using diagnostic fragment ions at m/z 98.9837, 78.9587, and 98.9648, etc., we identified 41 O(F)PEs (tri/di/mono-OPEs, cyclic OPEs, OFPEs), including 14 first-reported compounds (confidence level ≥ 3). These compounds were ubiquitously detected across 16 spent ternary LIPB packs, indicating their pervasive occurrence. The predominant compounds–trimethyl phosphate, dimethyl hydrogen phosphate, and fluoro(methoxy)phosphinic acid–were found at concentrations up to 105 ng/g. Aging experiments demonstrated that unused LIPB cells already contained O(F)PEs, with their formation accelerated by electrochemical cycling and thermal aging, indicating the continuous accumulation of O(F)PEs during battery operation. Further environmental risk assessment reveals that O(F)PEs exhibit high mobility, indicating their potential for environmental diffusion. Health risk ranking based on absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity parameters prioritized 1-[fluoro(propoxy)phosphoryl]oxypropane and 1-[ethoxy(fluoro)phosphoryl]oxypropane for occupational health monitoring.

Ozone production analysis revealed nearly equal contributions from formaldehyde and NO2, with spatial variability reflecting changing chemical sensitivity regimes. The sensitivity of O3 to precursor reduction test suggested that VOC‐focused controls are more effective than NOx under current conditions.

Here we show that the fractional contribution from passive volcanic degassing (fvolc) explains observed δ34S(SO42−), and that a global chemical transport model underestimates fvolc across Antarctica. Underestimated fvolc implies that the model mischaracterizes sulfate sources in this important region. The discrepancy between observed and modeled sulfate sources can be reconciled by increasing passive volcanic sulfur degassing emissions and decreasing DMS emissions. Our results imply that current biases in emissions inventories could bias assessments of aerosol‐cloud interactions in the Southern Ocean region and globally."

The pressure‐strain correlation plays an important role in the Reynolds stress budget. However, the behavior of the pressure‐strain correlation under rotation remains insufficiently explored. This study develops a closure model for the rotation‐induced pressure‐strain correlation. In rotating boundary layers, quasi two‐dimensional turbulent eddies are identified as key contributors to modulating the magnitude of the pressure‐strain correlation. By involving the anisotropic characteristics of these eddies, the proposed model represents the rotation‐induced pressure‐strain correlation as a function of the turbulence Rossby number and the Reynolds stresses. Direct numerical simulations are performed to evaluate the performance of the closure model. The results show that our closure model is in good agreement with direct numerical simulations. These findings provide valuable insights for improving the representation of rotating boundary layers in weather and climate models."

Using the high‐resolution WRF‐PALM nested model, we quantitatively evaluated the ABL disturbances caused by small‐scale islands. Sensitivity experiments with and without islands, conducted during both daytime and nighttime, were used to investigate the wake structures, their effects on near‐surface meteorology, and the underlying physical mechanisms. The results reveal notable diurnal variations in the wake structure. At night, orographic dynamics dominate, creating a wind sheltering effect in the leeward area, reducing wind speed, and forming a weak wind wake with downward motion near the surface. This reduces the upward kinematic turbulent sensible heat flux, inhibiting latent heat flux from the sea. During the day, thermal and dynamic forces contribute to a more complex wake structure, with accelerated airflows flanking the low‐speed wake on both sides. The convergence of wind streams induces upward motion and enhances wind‐driven mixing, thereby increasing turbulent sensible heat exchange within the wake zone. Even small islands induce substantial horizontal disturbances in the ABL, with the temperature wake at night extending 5.3 times the island's area and 5.9 times its length, reaching more than 15 km downstream. Thermal effects dominate over dynamic effects in influencing vertical ABL disturbances, increasing the disturbance heights of wind speed, potential temperature, and water vapor to 445 m, 665 m, and 675 m, respectively. These findings reveal the meteorological significance of small‐island wakes and their essential role in shaping local boundary‐layer processes."

However, due to the scarcity of in situ observations and the complex spatiotemporal variability of these sources, significant uncertainties remain in regional CH4 emission estimates. To address this, we conducted continuous atmospheric CH4 concentration measurements from 1 June 2023, to 31 May 2024, at a central YRD site. Using an atmospheric transport model and a Bayesian inversion framework, we quantified monthly and sub‐monthly CH4 emissions from different source categories, with a focus on waste treatment (including both landfill and wastewater). The results reveal the following key findings: (a) Substantial discrepancies were found between prior and posterior emissions across all categories. At the city scale, posterior annual CH4 emissions were estimated to be 87.4%, 64.6%, 109.5%, and 91.9% of prior emissions for all categories, waste treatment, rice paddy + wetland, and other sources, respectively, with waste treatment contributing the largest uncertainty. (b) Strong seasonal biases were observed, with waste treatment emissions peaking in August and reaching a minimum in March (a 2.6‐fold variation), while rice paddy emissions were overestimated in May and underestimated in August by a factor of two. (c) CH4 emissions from waste treatment exhibited high temperature sensitivity, increasing by 29%–31% per 10°C rise. Under future warming scenarios, waste treatment CH4 emission factors (EFs) will increase by up to 121.3% under SSP5‐8.5 by the end of the century (2091–2100), relative to 2023–2024 levels. In contrast, atmospheric pressure showed negligible influence (3.2% per 1 hPa) on waste treatment CH4 emissions. (d) More additional observations (i.e., satellite or multiple sites) are strongly suggested to resolve the prior spatial pattern of emissions, especially for fossil fuel‐related sources."

Chillrud,Surface Variable‐Based Machine Learning for Scalable Arsenic Prediction in Undersampled Areas,"In the United States, private wells are not federally regulated, and many households do not test for Arsenic (As). Chronic exposure is linked with multiple health outcomes, and risk can change sharply over short distances and with well depth. Coarse maps or sparse sampling often miss exceedances. Most existing models operate at ∼1 km resolution and use groundwater chemistry or detailed geologic logs, which limits their use in undersampled areas where improved guidance is most needed. We overcome these limitations by developing a machine learning model for Minnesota, USA, that predicts As exposure risk using only surficial variables from remote sensing and global data sets. Variables related to surface water hydrology and geomorphology are selected based on mechanistic links that control redox conditions and As mobilization. Local training was essential, and surficial geology variables that are more sensitive to local conditions were needed to maximize model accuracy. The resulting complete model was sufficiently sensitive to generate accurate and detailed risk maps and depth profiles of As concentrations above the 10 μg/L maximum contaminant level. Accuracy depended on local training data density. We identified a training data density of 0.07 wells/km2 as a practical target for stable county‐level performance. Maps of exceedance probabilities highlight priority areas for testing that are particularly important in rural communities that have received less sampling. These results support public health action by guiding where to install wells and where to test them, how much new sampling is needed, and where treatment outreach is most urgent."

We assessed census‐level sociodemographic variables among four counties adjacent to the Everglades Agricultural Area (n = 409 census tracts, 2016–2020). Smoke day counts from local agricultural fires were based on satellite plumes identified from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Hazard Mapping System. Primary analysis fit a negative binomial model with bidirectional stepwise regression, followed by an adjusted geospatial model with a Queen‐continuity adjacency matrix. Sensitivity analysis focused on rural‐only census tracts. Rural areas had higher concentrations of people of color and poverty compared to coastal urban areas. Median (Q1, Q3) smoke days by census tract was 36 (31, 45), with the highest concentrations in rural central and western regions. Primary model results skewed toward mostly urban tracts, where an interquartile ranges (IQR) increase in median household income was associated with a 12% decrease (95% confidence interval (CI) −14.5%, −5.2%) in smoke days. Among rural‐only census tracts, an IQR increase in percentage of residents living 200% below the poverty line and non‐English speaking residents were associated with 23% (95% CI: 1.2%, 37.7%) and 120% (95% CI: 20.5%, 176.5%) increases in smoke days, respectively.

 Label-free optical detection of nanometer-scale bioparticles is highly desirable for noninvasive biological studies but challenging due to the weak scattering signals that are difficult to distinguish from the illumination background. Interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT) has enabled high-sensitivity imaging by detecting the interference between the particle’s scattered light and a reference beam. However, enhancing the detection sensitivity and the image contrast for small particles continues to be a challenge in iSCAT. Here, we introduce meta-amplified dark-field interferometric scattering microscopy (MAD-iSCAT), which leverages a plasmonic metasurface to drastically enhance nanoparticle detection sensitivity in iSCAT. By employing a metasurface comprising sub-diffraction plasmonic meta-atom arrays, MAD-iSCAT generates bright radiation modes that intensely scatter light toward the far field in the presence of a detection nanoparticle, substantially amplifying the sensitivity. In the absence of a nanoparticle, the metasurface produces minimal background due to the dark collective mode, resulting in improved image contrast. We present a theoretical analysis of amplified interferometric imaging using designed metasurfaces and experimentally demonstrate enhancements in contrast and signal-to-noise ratio for detecting dielectric nanoparticles, exosomes, and proteins. Our approach offers broad applications in label-free biosensing and optical mass spectrometry, enabling significantly improved throughput and sensitivity.

 Vehicle emission is a major source of urban ultrafine particles (UFPs), yet measurement and emission control for UFP lags significantly behind that of other pollutants. The China VI emission standard, one of the strictest globally, introduced the nation’s first particle number (PN) limits. This study focused on real-world PN emissions in the capital city Beijing, which adopted China VI ahead of the national schedule in 2019. Based on long-term particle number size distribution measurements and online UFP composition analysis, a pronounced decline in emission rates of vehicle-attributed PN from 2019 to 2023 was found, resulting in decreases of ~70% for atmospheric PN3–30 nm, ~48% for PN30–100 nm, and ~42% for PN>100 nm. These reductions substantially outpace those observed for PM2.5 and NO2. Early implementation of China VI, coupled with rapid electric vehicle adoption, are the primary drivers behind Beijing’s more pronounced PN mitigation (−44%) compared with nationwide (−33%). These findings highlight the effectiveness of more stringent vehicle emission standards and electric vehicle strategies in reducing atmospheric UFPs, shedding light on future vehicle emission regulations.

 Glacier response to climate change results in rapid glacier water resource loss. Positive glacial regulatory processes (GRPs) are processes that buffer glacier water resource losses. Nevertheless, these processes are not systematically quantified, which may lead to uncertainty in glacier water resource sustainability assessments. Here, we employ a glacier water balance model to track glacier water resource transport trajectories and quantify contributions of positive GRPs across High Mountain Asia (HMA). The combined impacts of positive GRPs could mitigate ~236-255 Gt of HMA glacier water resource loss (~9%-13% of total mass loss) in the 21st century (2015-2100), suggesting underestimated glacier water resource sustainability. These contributions result from precipitation pattern transition (~0.9%-1.9%), nonlinear fluctuations in glacier dynamics (~4.7%-7.1%), rapid expansion of dead ice (~2.0%-2.4%), and retention of glacial meltwater by exposed depressions (~1.0%-1.3%). We highlight the importance of accurately assessing glacier water resource loss for water sustainability and sea level rise projections.

 Quantifying how rainwater infiltration modifies the stable isotope composition of soil pore water is essential for tracing water movement through the critical zone. We monitored intact soil columns under natural rainfall at high temporal resolution, jointly measuring seepage flux and the hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition of drainage water. The data reveal a robust, threshold-like pattern: faster seepage is consistently associated with more isotopically depleted drainage, behavior that is not readily explained by evaporation or simple mixing alone. We interpret this pattern as evidence for an interfacial hydrodynamic isotope fractionation process, in which transport dynamics and soil–water interfacial interactions partition water isotopologues without phase change. This framework refines how isotopes are used to infer soil water mixing and has implications for predicting recharge and ecosystem water use under a changing climate. In porous soil, physical transport processes and soil–water interactions can preferentially partition water isotopes during rainfall infiltration, resulting in interfacial hydrodynamic fractionation."

 Ship detection in remote sensing imagery is essential for diverse maritime-related tasks, including ocean surveillance, fisheries management, and environmental assessment. In operational scenarios, optical imagery provides rich texture cues under clear conditions, whereas synthetic aperture radar (SAR) enables reliable observation in nighttime and cloudy weather. However, cross-domain ship detection across optical and SAR modalities is still challenging due to discrepancies in imaging mechanisms, speckle noise, and background clutter, particularly in near-shore scenarios with similar reflection characteristics, together with the arbitrariness of ship orientation. To address these issues, we propose RotCD-Ship, a rotated cross-domain ship detection framework that bridges the domain gap between optical and SAR images while enabling accurate detection of arbitrarily oriented ships. Specifically, a domain knowledge-guided semantic prompt (DKSP) strategy based on SAR physical priors is introduced to suppress background clutter such as ship wakes and coastal interference. To handle modal divergence, we design a progressive feature alignment scheme that combines multi-scale local feature alignment (MSL-align) and global feature alignment (GF-align), enabling transfer of both fine-grained textures and high-level semantics across domains. Furthermore, a coarse-to-fine rotated region of interest (CF-RRoI) generator is developed to enhance localization precision of strip-like ships in SAR images by progressively refining orientation-aware proposals. Extensive evaluations on five public ship detection datasets show that RotCD-Ship significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving an average mAP improvement of 7.5% in the horizontal ship detection task and 5.5% in the oriented ship detection task compared to the best existing methods. In addition, large-scale tests on Gaofen-3 SAR images further verify the strong generalization in dense-ship and complex coastal environments, highlighting the practical applicability of our framework for all-weather maritime monitoring."

 Salt-marsh Fairy circles (FC) are enigmatic, quasi-circular structures linked to interacting biogeophysical processes, yet they remain difficult to detect and quantify at scale from conventional RGB imagery. Limited labeled data, transient and variable FC appearance, and severe class-imbalance make single-model machine learning (ML) unreliable for quantitative monitoring. We propose a framework for automatic FC recognition and enumeration on 3-band imagery. A zero-shot foundation model (SAM) segments images into instance-level blocks. Novel distribution-pattern and geometric features, class-equalized losses, weighted resampling, and augmentation are applied within deep-learning (U-Net, Attention-U-Net, Swin-Unet) and ensemble-learning (Random Forest, XGBoost) models. The key innovation is an imbalance-aware Bayesian method that fuses pixel-wise probabilities across models; a counting algorithm then tallies FC instances. We evaluate eight pan-sharpened scenes covering four sites along China’s coast. No individual ML model or standard Bayesian fusion is fully satisfactory. The imbalance-aware Bayesian method improves over the best single model: tight scheme: κ rises from 0.69 to 0.76, F1-score from 70.9% to 75.8% (Class 1) and from 63.5% to 68.2% (Class 2), and AUC from 84.8% to 93.1% and from 78.5% to 84.8%; loose scheme: κ increases from 0.74 to 0.79, AUC from 85.1% to 90.3%, F1-score from 74.3% to 78.6%. The counting algorithm achieves RMSE 1.62 and MAPE 0.33% over 1,135 instances, outperforming DBSCAN. A 22-month case study on Chongming Island captures marsh expansion and dieback dynamics through shifts between FC classes. Our framework delivers reliable FC recognition and enumeration on a small dataset with severe class-imbalance, generalizing across salt-marsh types."

 Plastic greenhouses (PGs), as a typical form of facility agriculture, play a crucial role in stabilizing agricultural production and increasing crop yields, but their rapid expansion has raised environmental concerns. Accurate long-term PGs monitoring is therefore essential for scientific agricultural regulation and environmental sustainability. However, most existing studies have focused on local regions or single-year mapping, and long-term PGs mapping remains limited. Moreover, acquiring multi-year high-quality training samples and developing effective classification algorithms remain major challenges for reliable PGs extraction. To address these issues, we propose a novel PGs mapping framework that integrates automatic sample generation with multi-temporal noise correction (MTNC), and utilizes Landsat time-series images to efficiently and accurately map multi-year PGs distribution in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain. Specifically, high-quality training samples were automatically generated from multi-source land use/land cover and PGs products through spatial rules and sample migration, followed by preliminary classification with Random Forest. The initial predictions were then refined through the MTNC strategy, and the optimized labels were subsequently employed to train a segmentation network for robust PGs extraction. Accuracy assessments on two independent validation datasets demonstrate that the final PGs maps achieve overall accuracies above 90% and Kappa coefficients greater than 0.8 across all years. And cross-comparisons with existing PGs products at multiple spatial resolutions show a high level of spatial consistency (R2 = 0.91 with PGs-10 and 0.74 with PGs-3), further confirming the reliability of the proposed framework and the high quality of the final products."

 Air pollution is linked to neuropsychiatric disorders, but causal evidence and underlying mechanisms remain insufficiently established. To investigate the causal association between air pollutant (PM2.5, PM10, coarse PM, and NO2) exposure and neuropsychiatric outcomes, this study employed Mendelian randomization (MR) and identified biomarkers and biological pathways implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. We found causal associations between air pollutants and 7 disorders. Furthermore, two-step MR integrating inflammatory factor, immune cell phenotypes, and CSF metabolomics identified 25 potential mediators linking air pollution to neuropsychiatric diseases. MR analysis integrated with pathway enrichment revealed that pollutant exposure may induce neurotoxicity by 3 core mechanisms, including the activation of inflammatory pathways (e.g., Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt (PI3K-Akt)) and dysregulation of lipid metabolism (e.g., arachidonic acid and α-linolenic acid metabolism). Notably, transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), SSC-A on HLA-DR + CD8+ T cells, and arachidonate (20:4n6) showed substantial mediation effects, accounting for 14.8 %, 17.5 %, and 21.6 % of the associations between PM2.5 and Alzheimer's disease (AD), PM2.5 and schizophrenia, and NO2 and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), respectively. These biomarkers represent potential targets for early detection and intervention, highlighting increased risk associated with long-term exposure to air pollution. Collectively, our findings provide novel causal and mechanistic evidence that may inform both air quality regulation and the allocation of neuropsychiatric healthcare resources in high-risk populations."

 Aerosols play key role in cloud nucleation and atmospheric radiation processes, thus an accurate aerosol modeling is critical for numerical weather predictions. This study establishes an aerosol optical depth (AOD) 3D-Var data assimilation (DA) scheme for the CMA-MESO/CUACE weather prediction model, assimilates AOD retrievals derived from the Fengyun-4B (FY-4B) satellite, and evaluates the impacts of AOD DA on weather predictions through a month-long hindcast experiment. The AOD observation operator is built based on a look-up table, of which the aerosol optical properties (AOP) are computed for non-spherical dust with the invariant imbedding T-matrix method and for spherical anthropogenic aerosols with the Lorenz–Mie method, respectively. The month-long model results are evaluated using the AERONET measurements and ground-based weather observations across China. Results show a significant reduction of the bias of the AOD prediction by up to 0.2 by assimilating AOD retrievals. The improved AOD predictions further positively influence the modeling of the atmospheric thermal-dynamic structures.

 A profiled hydrometeor classification algorithm (HCA) for the dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR) onboard the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission (GPM DPR-HCA) was developed using retrievals from a ground-based radar. A four-dimensional feature vector consisting of Ku- and Ka-band reflectivity, the dual-frequency ratio, and air temperature from the GPM DPR was selected as input features and collocated with hydrometeor classifications from the ground-based dual-polarization radar in Guangzhou (GZ) to generate a labeled dataset. The average feature vector of each class was taken as its centroid. Euclidean distances between a sample and the centroid vectors of hydrometeor classes were computed, and the class with the minimum distance was assigned to the sample. Applying the GPM DPR-HCA to a precipitation case demonstrated that the retrieved hydrometeor profiles agreed well with those from GZ radar. The algorithm was evaluated against the hydrometeor classification results of GZ radar and the GPM DPR-Official phase product. Assessment results showed that PODs exceeded 0.75 for liquid- and mixed-phase hydrometeors, whereas PODs were 0.66 for hail and 0.43 for low-density graupel among solid-phase classes due to substantial feature overlaps. Regional application over the Yangtze-Huai River Valley Region and South China revealed that wet snow, graupel, and ice crystals dominated the mid- and upper levels during stratiform events, while graupel and hail were more frequent in convective events. The accuracy and reliability of the GPM DPR-HCA make it a candidate for the development of hydrometeor classification products of spaceborne precipitation radars."

 Tropical cyclones (TCs) are typically associated with intense convection and heavy rainfall; however, their broader influence on concurrent heatwave (HW) and air-quality extremes remains poorly understood. This study examines the complex interactions between cyclone dynamics, HWs, and aerosols during the prolonged TC Biparjoy in June 2023. While the cyclone produced widespread rainfall over western and northwestern India, persistent HWs prevailed across the central-east and peninsular regions. The cyclone's slow movement over northwestern India reinforced subsidence and high-pressure anomalies, leading to a 2–4 °C rise in surface temperatures and an expansion of the extent and intensity of HWs. Satellite observations revealed elevated aerosol loading up to 5 km over the HW-affected regions, dominated by absorbing dust and polluted dust aerosols. Analysis of dust transport and circulation patterns showed that strong westerly winds trailing the cyclone entrained coarse dust aerosols (>1.0 μm) from the Middle East and Central Asia, contributing to the widespread vertical enhancement of aerosols across central and peninsular India. Aerosol Direct Radiative Forcing (ADRF) analysis showed positive atmospheric forcing and negative surface forcing, implying a radiative imbalance that may have intensified near-surface heating through feedback mechanisms. The results highlight a compound TC-HW-Aerosol event, wherein cyclone-induced subsidence and dust transport jointly amplified regional heat extremes and atmospheric warming despite concurrent rainfall elsewhere."

 The implementation of air pollution mitigation strategies requires not only high-quality continuous measurements of pollutants but also proper definitions of ways to differentiate between transported and locally produced contributions, as only the latter can be effectively reduced by authorities. To address this issue, we propose a new approach for partitioning monitored black carbon (BC) concentrations into city-produced (urban) and transported fractions using a combination of measured and modeled data. Two simultaneous measurement campaigns (warm season 2022 and cold season 2022/23) were conducted in two urban environments: Vilnius (Lithuania) and Warsaw (Poland). In the cold season in Warsaw, BC mass concentration was 90% higher than in the warm season, while in Vilnius, an increase of 44% was observed, as compared to the warm season. Aerosol optical properties showed more complex aerosol mixtures of dust, BC and brown carbon (BrC) during the cold season, forming larger particles. Single scattering albedo (SSA) anti-correlated with BCFF, proving that fossil fuel (FF) combustion contributes to the warming effect in both cities. A positive correlation between the population density of the emission areas of transported BC and the BC mass concentrations in Vilnius and Warsaw was found. The impact of transported BC on the local BC levels in the cities was of 53±8% and 36±28% in the cold season and of 23±7% and 13±21% in the warm season for Warsaw and Vilnius, respectively. Thus, the approach of BC partitioning showed that in the cold season, the two cities suffered from worse air quality, in part due to more transported BC."

However, the 2023 release of the US Environmental Protection Agency’s National Emissions Inventory (NEI) found that RWC contributes ~28% of total wintertime fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions, suggesting that ambient PM2.5concentrations could be substantially reduced if RWC were curtailed. Despite its contribution to PM2.5emissions, an assessment of the air quality, health, and distributional impacts of RWC using the updated NEI has not been performed. Here, we use a high-resolution (4 kilometers) air quality model and the updated NEI to evaluate wintertime RWC impacts over the contiguous United States. We find that RWC contributes 2.43 micrograms per cubic meter (21.9%) of winter population-weighted mean PM2.5concentrations, leading to ~8600 (confidence interval: 6500 to 9600) premature deaths annually. Moreover, nonwhite communities are disproportionately affected by RWC-related PM2.5and associated mortality, especially in urban areas. We suggest that policies targeting RWC could substantially reduce air pollution, improve health, and address distributional disparities."

A composite air pollution score was derived through principal component analysis. Short-term exposure to particulate matter and NO2 was positively associated with hospital admissions for AECOPD, with the largest temperature- and humidity-adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 1.101 (1.073, 1.129) at a lag of 1 day for per 1 standard deviation increase in air pollution score. The effect of O3 appeared to be conflicting. The associations were further corroborated by the self-controlled case-series design. Unfavorable body shapes, cold season, and low humidity could exacerbate the influence of air pollution.

However, partitioning ERA5 and model precipitation into resolved and parameterized convective components reveals that even in high‐resolution models, the simulated mesoscale SST‐precipitation relationship is shaped by the characteristics of convective parameterization. Further, the precipitation response to SST is strongly dependent on the background SST and SST variability in coupled models. Further analysis of ERA5 and high‐resolution simulations shows a vertical velocity response extending to 500 hPa. However, the reliance on convective parameterizations introduces uncertainties about whether high‐resolution models accurately capture these effects."

 Entanglement, a key feature of quantum mechanics, is recognized for its non-classical correlations which have been shown to provide significant noise resistance in single-photon rangefinding and communications. Drawing inspiration from the advantage given by energy-time entanglement, we developed an energy-time correlated source based on a classical laser that preserves the substantial noise reduction typical of quantum illumination while surpassing the quantum brightness limitation by over six orders of magnitude, making it highly suitable for practical remote sensing applications. A frequency-agile pseudo-random source is realized through fiber chromatic dispersion and pulse carving using an electro-optic intensity modulator. Operating at a faint transmission power of 48 μW, the distance between two buildings 154.8182 m apart can be measured with a precision better than 0.1 mm, under varying solar background levels and weather conditions with an integration time of only 100 ms. These trials verified the predicted noise reduction of this system, demonstrating advantages over quantum illumination-based rangefinding and highlighting its potential for practical remote sensing applications.

 The January 2022 eruption of the Hunga volcano (20∘S) injected 150 Tg of water vapour into the middle atmosphere, leading to an increase in the stratospheric water burden of 10%, unprecedented in the observational record. In the first two years post eruption the stratospheric burden hardly changed, leaving the residence time of volcanically injected water vapour, a key control on its climate impact, uncertain. Here, using satellite observations, we show a substantial decline from 2024 to early 2025, the largest drop since the eruption. Comparison with 3-D numerical model simulations shows that the long-term removal of the Hunga water has now entered a new phase, with stratosphere-troposphere exchange playing an increasingly important role, exceeding Antarctic dehydration in 2024. We estimate that the additional stratospheric water vapour is now decaying steadily with an e-folding time of 3 years and will reach the observed pre-Hunga range of variability around 2030.

 The escalating frequency of extreme heatwaves coupled with the deep decarbonization of the power system pose growing challenges to the reliable operation of metropolitan power systems. In megacity clusters, heatwave-induced blackouts leave densely populated and vulnerable communities exposed to prolonged thermal stress, significantly elevating urban health risks. In response, we proposes a health-aware decarbonization framework that integrates meteorology, power systems, and urban health—offering a comprehensive, systems-level solution to support the development of resilient, and sustainable cities under intensifying climate stress. Our results indicate that while decarbonizing the power system is crucial for meeting climate goals, it may unintentionally increase heat-related deaths in large urban areas.

 Rapid Arctic warming is thawing carbon-rich permafrost, releasing greenhouse gases that accelerate climate change. Despite the importance of this feedback, permafrost-enabled global-scale models simulate only gradual, top-down thickening of the seasonally-thawed soil. This ignores abrupt permafrost thaw and intensifying fire regimes that combust soil carbon and further accelerate thaw. Here, we expand a compact Earth system model (OSCAR v3.0) enabling initial estimates of the impacts of abrupt thaw and wildfire, together with gradual thaw, on remaining carbon budgets consistent with the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. Our model suggests that including permafrost thaw and fire-related carbon emissions reduces the remaining allowable carbon budgets from 2025 onward by 25 % ± 12 % for avoiding 1.5 °C and 17 % ± 7 % for avoiding 2.0 °C, relative to simulations without these processes.

 Climate change is shifting the timing of autumnal phenology, with potentially different impacts on leaf coloration and photosynthetic cessation. Here we derive the end of the growing season across northern ecosystems from 2001 to 2021 using satellite-based measures of vegetation greenness, indicating leaf coloration, and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence, indicating photosynthetic activity. We examine temporal changes in the difference between these two metrics and the factors driving these trends. Leaf coloration generally occurred later than photosynthetic cessation, and the difference increased significantly over time. This growing discrepancy was primarily driven by earlier starts of the growing season and rising autumn temperatures. Earlier spring onset influenced autumn timing through its effects on peak growth timing and seasonal carbon uptake, with a stronger impact on photosynthetic cessation than on leaf coloration. Warmer autumn further increased the discrepancy by delaying both processes, slightly more for leaf coloration. This mismatch can intensify respiratory carbon loss, with implications for climate-adaptive forest management.

 Belowground properties, including belowground microbial communities and physicochemical characteristics, play a crucial role in ecosystem functioning. Developing scalable approaches to map these properties across large spatial domains is essential for advancing our understanding of ecosystem functioning. However, large-scale approaches for mapping belowground properties, particularly in vegetated ecosystems, have yet to be developed. In this study, we aimed to develop approaches to map belowground microbial communities (bacterial and fungal) and physicochemical characteristics in an extensive grassland ecosystem affected by invasive plants using airborne and spaceborne imaging spectroscopy (hyperspectral remote sensing). We focused on Lespedeza cuneata (L. cuneata), an invasive plant threatening grasslands of the U.S. Southern Great Plains. We developed structural equation models to determine aboveground-belowground linkages. We used airborne hyperspectral data to estimate aboveground characteristics from partial least squares regression and then mapped belowground properties using aboveground characteristics through generalized joint attribute models. We also assessed the capability of spaceborne data in mapping the spatial distribution of belowground properties through fusing coarse spatial resolution DLR's DESIS hyperspectral data with fine spatial resolution PlanetScope multispectral data. Our findings showed that there are linkages between percent cover of L. cuneata, aboveground characteristics, and belowground properties. Large-scale analysis using airborne hyperspectral data showed that belowground properties varied across increasing percent cover of L. cuneata. Similar results were observed when using fused spaceborne data. Our findings indicated that (1) spectral information can reveal belowground properties and (2) fusing spaceborne data can be an effective approach to mapping belowground properties in grassland ecosystems."

 The emergence of vision language models (VLMs) bridges the gap between vision and language, enabling multimodal understanding beyond traditional visual-only deep learning models. However, transferring VLMs from the natural image domain to remote sensing (RS) segmentation remains challenging due to the large domain gap and the diversity of RS inputs across tasks, particularly in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) and referring expression segmentation (RES). Here, we propose a training-free unified framework, termed DGL-RSIS, which decouples visual and textual representations and performs visual-language alignment at both local semantic and global contextual levels. Specifically, a Global–Local Decoupling (GLD) module decomposes textual inputs into local semantic tokens and global contextual tokens, while image inputs are partitioned into class-agnostic mask proposals. Then, a Local Visual–Textual Alignment (LVTA) module adaptively extracts context-aware visual features from the mask proposals and enriches textual features through knowledge-guided prompt engineering, achieving OVSS from a local perspective. Furthermore, a Global Visual–Textual Alignment (GVTA) module employs a global-enhanced Grad-CAM mechanism to capture contextual cues for referring expressions, followed by a mask selection module that integrates pixel-level activations into mask-level segmentation outputs, thereby achieving RES from a global perspective. Experiments on the iSAID (OVSS) and RRSIS-D (RES) benchmarks demonstrate that DGL-RSIS outperforms existing training-free approaches. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each module. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first unified training-free framework for RS image segmentation, which effectively transfers the semantic capability of VLMs trained on natural images to the RS domain without additional training."

 Leaf Water Content (LWC) is vital for assessing winter wheat growth. Due to spectral band sensitivity variations, improving spectral feature fitting through preprocessing and optimization is a challenging issue. This study systematically investigates wavelength-dependent LWC sensitivity under multiple preprocessing operators to identify spectral bands highly correlated with winter wheat LWC under different preprocessing methods and evaluate band replacement (representation selection at fixed wavelength) and fusion strategies (constrained union within the same feature-selection method with wavelength de-duplication) for optimizing feature combinations and enhancing model accuracy and robustness. Various feature extraction techniques were applied to identify LWC-correlated spectral bands. Bands replacement (producing “Replacement Features”) and constrained feature fusion (producing “Fusion Features”) were introduced for feature optimization. Multiple modeling methods were employed to assess LWC monitoring performance using initial, replaced, and fused feature sets under a consistent train–test split with training-set cross-validation. The combination of first derivative (FD) preprocessing, Iterative Variable Subset Optimization (IVSO) feature selection, and Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) modeling yielded the best monitoring results. Fusion Features selected by IVSO achieved the highest accuracy, evaluated by R2, RMSE, and Akaike information criterion (AIC) (R2Train = 0.960, RMSETrain = 0.016, AICTrain = -1010.061; R2Test = 0.956, RMSETest = 0.015, AICTest = -98.362). Both band replacement and fusion enhanced model robustness and addressed spectral sensitivity issues.

 High-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) are critical for applications such as environmental monitoring and urban planning, motivating the development of advanced DEM super-resolution (SR) techniques. While recent methods have shown promising results, effectively exploiting high-resolution remote sensing images (HRSIs) to guide DEM SR remains challenging, and progress has been hindered by the lack of large-scale, open-source benchmark datasets. We propose GSRMTL, a novel and parameter-efficient multi-task learning framework for HRSI-guided DEM SR. Given a low-resolution DEM and a paired HRSI, GSRMTL jointly performs DEM SR and semantic segmentation of the optical imagery, where segmentation acts as an auxiliary task to provide semantic priors for elevation reconstruction. To address the dataset bottleneck, we introduce GDEMSR, the first large-scale benchmark dataset specifically designed for HRSI-guided DEM SR. Extensive experiments on GDEMSR and the RGB-guided depth SR benchmark NYU-v2 demonstrate that GSRMTL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods while using significantly fewer parameters, highlighting its effectiveness and practical deployment potential."

Recent trends in PM<sub>2.5</sub> in rural environments in metropolitan France,"•Decreasing trends in daily PM2.5at French rural sites at −5.6 % year−1in 2014–2021. •Decrease in PM2.5emissions in the footprint aligned with that in PM2.5observations. •Trends in de-weathered, de-weathered & deoxidises PM2.5closer to that in emissions. •Lack of linearity between NOXemissions and nitrate at the north sites of France. 
 Trends in daily PM2.5 concentrations were assessed at 5 rural background sites in France in 2014–2021, together with major particulate components which concentrations were attributed to (i) anthropogenic emissions including fossil fuels (FF) and biomass burning (BB) from primary emissions; and (ii) secondary particulate constituents including non-sea-salt sulphate, nitrate and ammonium. Annual PM2.5 concentrations correlated to annual emissions in both SO2 and NOX in France at all sites; correlations to primary PM2.5 emissions varied depending on the site. To disentangle the influence of weather, long-range transport, and the conditions controlling for PM secondary formation on the PM2.5 time series, boosted regression tree (BRT) models were built at each site for PM2.5; and normalised time series calculated by randomising the value of the explanatory variables at a given time. Two BRT models with their respective normalised PM2.5 time series were calculated: de-weathered time series (without the influence of the meteorological and long-range transport) and de-weathered & de-oxidised time series (randomisation of meteorology, transport and OX (NO2 + O3) concentrations). In 2014–2021, PM2.5 decreased at −5.6 % year−1, almost twice as fast as changes in primary emissions in France and neighbouring countries (about −3 % year−1). Overall trends in de-weathered, and de-weathered and de-oxidised PM2.5 were lower than that in PM2.5 observations, at −3.9 % year−1 and -3.2 % year−1, respectively. Trends in de-weathered & de-oxidised PM2.5 were close to those in emissions, demonstrating the role of including variables capturing the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere in the normalising techniques to compare trends in PM2.5 with primary emissions. Faster downward rates in PM2.5 aerosols in rural background in mainland France were mostly associated with the decrease in gas emissions responsible for secondary particles and less sensitive to changes in primary emissions. Control of NH3 emissions is suggested to be crucial to ensure downward trends in PM2.5 at the regional background environments to reduce concentrations closer to WHO limits."

 Aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI) for marine-continental mixed aerosols (MCMA) in coastal zones remain poorly constrained in climate models. Combining aircraft observations and WRF simulations during a spring 2023 North China precipitation event, we demonstrate distinct vertical stratification: MCMA dominates below 3000 m with variable activation (4.2 %) due to compositional complexity, while continental aerosols (CA) prevail above 3000 m with lower activation (2.1 %) from homogeneous properties. MCMA's broader size distribution (enhanced giant aerosols >0.5 μm), yielding higher cloud droplet concentrations (Nc) but lower spectral dispersion (ε) than CA (Nc = 96.6 cm−3, ε = 0.263 vs. Nc = 57.5 cm−3, ε = 0.375). Integrating observed aerosol data into WRF revealed that parameterizing ε-Nc relationships under MCMA improves cloud microphysics representation, capturing cloud-water mixing ratios (up to 0.44 g kg−1) and precipitation patterns. Results highlight the critical role of aerosol mixing states in modulating cloud processes and necessitate refined parameterizations for coastal aerosols in climate models."

 The LMA network SAETTA has observed thunderstorms from 2014 to 2023. During this period, 54 thunderstorm days with negative dipole charge structures were observed during African dust flow events over the Corsica island, mainly during the warm season. The spatial and temporal distribution of thunderstorm days provided by SAETTA data shows nocturnal events with negative dipole charge structure, without preferential regions (even on land and on sea), while classic thunderstorms over Corsica with normal tripole charge structure occur mainly over mountains in the daytime. In the case of negative dipole events, METEORAGE data show more intense and frequent +CG lightning flashes than classical thunderstorms, and 89.4% of -IC lightning flashes. Furthermore, ERA-5,reanalysis data and radiosonde data exhibit dry and warm low layers, with a temperature inversion near the surface, forcing the triggering of elevated convection. This observation could be a consequence of the radiative impact of Saharan dust. This study shows no evidence for the microphysical impact of aerosols, i.e. the multiplication of ice crystals despite supercooled water droplets.

 Although Yunnan, located in southwestern China, is recognized as a transitional zone between the Indian Summer Monsoon and the East Asian Monsoon, the extent to which distinct moisture sources and associated transport pathways influence precipitation isotopic variability in this region remains poorly quantified. Here, we analyzed a four-and-a-half-year precipitation isotope dataset from Kunming and differentiated between precipitation sourced from the Bay of Bengal (BoB) and the South China Sea (SCS). We observe a strong seasonal δ18O contrast of 7.4‰ in BoB-sourced precipitation, which accounts for ∼61% of the moisture supply for Kunming precipitation. In contrast, SCS-sourced precipitation exhibits a weak seasonality of only 1.8‰ in δ18O. Our analysis indicates that seasonal changes of evaporative conditions in BoB source and upstream meteorology along its transport path produce this pattern, while relatively stable SCS source and transport conditions result in minimal seasonal variability. Simulation results demonstrate that SCS-sourced δ18O largely follows Rayleigh distillation, whereas BoB-sourced δ18O deviates from this simple model, indicating the influence of additional processes. We further find that the tropospheric temperature gradient is a key thermodynamic driver of precipitation δ18O, showing a persistent negative correlation across seasons and moisture sources. In addition, precipitation d-excess responds differently to the two moisture sources. D-excess in BoB-sourced precipitation partially reflects source-region and transport-path conditions, while SCS-sourced precipitation shows no such consistent relationships. Overall, this work quantifies the distinct isotopic fingerprints of these two major moisture sources to southwestern China, providing an advance for modeling regional water cycles and interpreting isotopic paleoclimate archives."

Specifically, our results revealed significant growth in total nonpolymeric PFAS flows in 2023, with the average estimate of total nonpolymeric PFAS emissions reaching 1.06 × 105 kg, 95.5% of which originated from PTFE production. Under a high estimate, in-use perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) stocks surged from 21.0 kg in 2000 to 1.22 × 103 kg in 2019, and then reduced by 76.5% by 2050. These results align with China’s PFAS phase-out measures under the Stockholm Convention. Importantly, our results showed a regulatory-induced PFAS compositional transformation. By 2050, emerging PFAS will dominate relative to legacy perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) (3.64 × 104 kg): emerging PFAAs (2.30 × 104 kg), perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids (8.24 × 103 kg), fluorotelomer sulfonic acids (1.11 × 104 kg), and other PFAS.

Traditional culture-based detection methods require long incubation times (typically 24–48 h) and often underestimate the microbial concentrations. In this study, we present a femtomolar-level sensitivity biosensor leveraging fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) for detecting adenosine triphosphate (ATP) derived from airborne bacteria. This biosensor utilizes a fluorophore-labeled cDNA (DNA) strand, an unlabeled ATP-specific aptamer, and graphene oxide (GO) that preferentially adsorbs single-stranded DNA over double-stranded DNA. An indirect hybridization approach was employed to avoid the structural interference often observed with directly labeled aptamers, thus improving hybridization efficiency and fluorescence contrast. Under optimized conditions, the biosensor achieved a regression-based analytical limit of detection (LOD) of 0.52 fM ATP while experimentally enabling the detection of airborne bacteria down to 2.4 colony-forming units (CFU) per 1 mL. Importantly, the analytical assay time per measurement was approximately 15 min, which is markedly shorter than that of conventional culture-based methods. The effectiveness and sensitivity of the biosensor were validated through indoor field tests, demonstrating the ability to detect airborne bacteria at concentrations below 102 CFU per 1 m3 of air. This culture-independent method provides a rapid and practical approach for airborne bacterial monitoring and is directly applicable to indoor air quality evaluation and infectious disease management."

Here, we investigate the influence of the overlooked Zonal Wave‐3 (ZW3) mode, characterized by three alternating cyclone–anticyclone pairs in the Southern Hemisphere mid‐latitudes. Simulations with ZW3 perturbations of different phases show multi‐year impacts on dense water formation and export. The PC1 phase exerts the strongest influence in the Ross Sea, while the PC2 phase can nearly shut down or double dense water formation in the Weddell Sea. A simulation with interannually varying atmospheric forcing confirms ZW3 correlates with dense water formation in both regions.

In details, daytime hot triggers high daytime O3 concentration by enhancing O3‐forming photochemistry, thereby providing a nocturnal residual layer (RL) with O3‐rich air and substantial heat storage. Nighttime, the persistent day‐night hot combined with easterly flow jointly drive a plateau‐basin secondary circulation across RL and stable boundary layer over the SCB, facilitating RL's O3‐rich air mixing to the surface and increasing nighttime O3 concentration.

We find the highest annual mean values of the Lagrangian continentality over arid regions, with an absolute maximum of about 50 days over the Taklamakan desert. We also find strong seasonal variations, with summer values often being higher by about a factor 2 than winter values. Exceptions are summer minima over areas affected by monsoon systems.

Under the incidence of long‐period Alfvén waves carrying downward field‐aligned currents, a parallel potential drop forms in the transition region between magnetospheric hot electrons and ionospheric cold electrons, accelerating cold electrons upward. These accelerated electrons progressively replace hot electrons as the main current carrier. Parametric investigations show that the ratio of potential drop to downward field‐aligned current increases with hot‐electron temperature and decreases with hot electron density, and is several (7–8) times smaller than that for upward currents because less potential drop is required for more abundant cold electrons to reach the same current magnitude.

Here we present molybdenum (Mo) isotopic records from International Ocean Discovery Program Site U1509. Raman spectroscopy shows that Mn and Fe occur mainly as MnO2 and Fe–Mn oxides. The δ98/95Mo values show a sustained negative shift from ∼1‰ to −2‰ between ∼59.5 and 50.5 Ma, and this trend is best explained by strengthened Mo adsorption onto Mn and Fe bearing oxides at the sediment–water interface. This mechanism provides a direct basis for interpreting the Mo isotope depletion, indicating prolonged bottom‐water oxygenation within early Cenozoic greenhouse conditions. At ∼50.5 Ma, a sharp decline in silicate εNd values and coeval rises in Ti, Zr, and Sc enrichment factors indicate intensified continental weathering that supplied isotopically light Mo. These results provide new constraints on early Cenozoic redox evolution."

However, reliable uncertainty estimation with generative capabilities remains crucial for actionable forecasting and simulation, yet robust quantification methods remain challenging. Recently, engression, a generative approach for model‐agnostic uncertainty quantification, has been proposed. We evaluate its feasibility for environmental time‐series modeling, specifically applying it to rainfall‐runoff prediction using long short‐term memory (LSTM) networks. As a benchmark, we use quantile regression, a generalization of the mean absolute error. In our analysis, we focus on the quality of the uncertainty estimates and realism of generated sequences, while including a comparison to point‐prediction performance as a sanity check. Our results show that LSTM‐engression is an effective and easy‐to‐use method for generative modeling, outperforming quantile regression in uncertainty quantification. Qualitative analysis of the generated time series indicates high dynamic fidelity. These findings highlight LSTM‐engression as a promising approach for incorporating uncertainty into environmental modeling."

In the present study, we describe algebraic formulas adapted from the standard SABER Version 2 method for estimating daytime and nighttime O based on the assumption that ozone in the upper mesosphere is in equilibrium. We highlight uncertainties in the calculations that lead to global mean differences ranging up to a factor of two or more in the nighttime O concentration. Important considerations are the choice of which reactions are included in the ozone budget and the values of uncertain parameters used in the model of emissions from vibrationally excited hydroxyl. SABER observations cover almost all local times. Since O is long‐lived in the upper mesosphere, the dominant source of diurnal variation is transport by tidal winds. Even when accounting for this transport, there are appreciable differences between daytime and nighttime O. Daytime O is higher than is consistent with the nighttime O that is estimated from several methods. The estimated daytime O has a strong and nearly linear dependence on ozone while the nighttime O is sensitive to multiple parameters in the model of OH airglow emissions. The day/night discrepancy supports other evidence that the SABER daytime mesospheric ozone has large uncertainties and needs to be updated."

Multiple PRSs, including the 30‐dBZ and 40‐dBZ echo‐tops, the integrated intensities of ZDR ${Z}_{\text{DR}}$ and KDP ${K}_{\text{DP}}$ columns, the maximum graupel and hail height, as well as the changes in ZH ${Z}_{H}$ and ZDR ${Z}_{\text{DR}}$ within the warm‐cloud layer, can to some extent indicate the mean raindrop size, number concentration, and rain rate at the low level (1‐km level). A Multi‐Layer Perceptron model is designed and trained to preliminarily predict these RSD parameters using the PRSs as inputs. These RSD parameters are generally reproduced and the correlations between predicted and observed values are above 0.8. The study clearly demonstrates the quantitative constraints of PRSs on low‐level RSDs in heavy‐rainfall‐producing convection. Such microphysical constraints have potential applications for polarimetric radar in the prediction of RSDs and rainfall intensity."

While several studies have quantified the changing patterns of exposure, the extent of inequality in exposure among population subgroups at the sub‐national scale remains unknown. In this study, we examined the disparity in ambient PM2.5 exposure across various population subgroups in urban and rural India and analyzed its changes in recent years by integrating satellite‐derived PM2.5 concentrations (1‐km × 1‐km) with sociodemographic information from the 4th (2015–2016) and 5th (2019–2021) rounds of the National Family Health Survey. We found a larger absolute disparity (60–90 µgm−3) in high socio‐demographic index (SDI) states compared to middle and lower SDI states. Moreover, we discovered that ambient PM2.5 exposure was higher (indicated by relative disparities in terms of Zscore) among the top and bottom quantiles of wealth index and the other backward caste subgroup (Zscore > ±0.02, p < 0.1) than among their demographic counterparts in middle and high SDI states. From 2015–2016 to 2019–2021, the disparity in ambient PM2.5 exposure across subgroups increased in urban areas, while it either remained static or decreased in rural areas. India's urban‐centric approach to addressing air pollution may further exacerbate disparities among diverse demographics. Therefore, we recommend the formulation of targeted policies aimed at reducing ambient PM2.5 exposure and alleviating disparities by prioritizing actions for the vulnerable subgroups."

 Continuous monitoring of deep-seated slow-moving landslides is a critical measure to mitigate risks posed by catastrophic events, especially under increasing extreme weather conditions. As a non-contact, high-resolution measurement technique, space-borne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has been widely applied in landslide monitoring. However, when used for continuous monitoring, challenges remain, including incomplete monitoring dimensions, slow update efficiency, and insufficient temporal resolution. To address these, this paper proposes a fusion framework of physics-based and data-driven models, built on a Kalman Filter, to rapidly obtain daily 4D (spatial 3D with time) landslide movements based on movement characteristics and dependence on hydrometeorological factors. The method's performance was evaluated using both synthetic and real datasets. On synthetic data, RMSEs in the east, north, and vertical directions were 9.6 mm, 3.8 mm, and 1.4 mm, respectively. For real data, the daily 4D movements were projected onto the Line-of-Sight (LOS) directions of Sentinel-1 Track 11 and ALOS2 PALSAR2 for comparison, achieving sub-centimeter Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs). These results confirm the accuracy of the estimated movements and demonstrate enhanced update efficiency enabled by the Kalman Filter, which allows rapid assimilation of new data without reprocessing the full historical archive. Additionally, by incorporating geophysical and geodynamic methods, we leveraged daily 4D movements to derive various landslide parameters to analyze the kinematics of the Chuwangjing landslide during 2016–2024. The findings indicate that daily 4D movements not only enhance InSAR's performance in continuous landslide monitoring but also provide additional derivative products, deepening the understanding of deep-seated landslide kinematics."

 The ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2) carries a revolutionary photon-counting lidar and diverse studies have demonstrated its great observational capabilities on Earth observations. However, it is still difficult to obtain high quality land surface reflectance in that a single measurement (e.g., the laser signal derived apparent surface reflectance) is characterized by two main unknowns, i.e., the SR (surface reflectance) and atmospheric transmission. As the radiative properties of ICESat-2 laser signal and solar noise are simultaneously obtained, we combine signal and noise information to achieve the co-observations, which show how two measurements help to decouple the reflectivity of atmosphere from surfaces and thus resolve this inherent ill-posed problem. Specifically, we propose the theoretical laser signal and solar noise models for spaceborne lidars that link the two measurements (the signal count and background rate) to the two unknowns. Then, a method and workflow applied for ICESat-2 is designed to retrieve the AOTs (aerosol optical thickness) and SRs. The performance is validated against the MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and AERONET (Aerosol Robotic NETwork) product with the average MAPE (mean absolute percentage errors) of less than 30% for AOTs and the average MAPE of less than 15% for SRs in different land cover types. In addition, the ability of this method to identify snow-covered or cloud-covered areas is explored and validated. This study provides a reference for the active and passive co-observations. In the future, satellites carrying both lidar and multispectral cameras could enable higher quality Earth observations, with the lidar enabling more accurate isolation of atmospheric and surface contributions."

 Mangroves in the Beibu Gulf of the northern south China sea are vital for coastal protection and carbon storage but have undergone pronounced spatial changes over recent decades due to rapid urbanization and climate variability. Existing monitoring efforts, largely constrained to annual temporal resolution, fail to capture seasonal dynamics and fine-scale transformations induced by human activities. In addition, existing change detection methods are either based on statistical machine learning or fully convolutional deep learning, which have limited ability to detect long-term dynamic changes in mangrove forests. To address these challenges, a temporal semantic segmentation change detection with multi-scale dilated convolutions (TSSCD-D) framework was proposed, and the Landsat time series (1987–2022) was used for high-resolution mangrove dynamics monitoring. The proposed approach expands the temporal receptive field, enabling improved representation of long-term changes. Model evaluation demonstrates an overall accuracy of 87.3%, with producer’s and user’s accuracies for mangroves of 97.1% and 96.8%, outperforming other methods (see Table 2). Analysis reveals a sharp decline in mangrove area from 856.1 km2 in 1987 to 532.8 km2 in 1998, primarily driven by reclamation and infrastructure development, followed by gradual recovery to 824.3 km2 by 2022 under conservation policies. Transition mapping shows that conversions with water bodies, marshes, and irrigated croplands account for 80% of total changes, indicating strong hydrological and anthropogenic influences. These findings provide critical insights and fine-scale datasets to support long-term mangrove conservation and management in tropical coastal systems.More details on TSSCD-D can be found at https://github.com/CUG-BEODL/TSSCD-D."

 Forests exhibit complex vertical structures, and understanding the vertical distribution of gross primary production (GPP) is critical for improving carbon cycle assessments. While previous studies have emphasized the contribution of understory, approaches such as eddy-covariance provide only site-level observations and are constrained by sparse spatial coverage and footprint limitations, leaving large-scale assessment and mapping unresolved. This study identified key parameters of GPP vertical heterogeneity and developed a remote sensing framework to quantify and map its distribution in forests. We integrated hyperspectral imagery and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds to retrieve physiological and biochemical parameters as well as the vertical distribution of canopy structure, which were used to drive GPP modeling. Based on the outputs of the SCOPE (Soil Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy Fluxes) model, we visualized the vertical profile of GPP and quantified the overstory and understory. Sensitivity and mechanistic analyses were performed using simulated data to investigate the effects of vegetation biophysical and biochemical parameters on vertical GPP. We further estimated and validated the vertical distribution of GPP across seven National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) forests. The results showed that LAI (leaf area index) was the dominant driver of GPP in canopy layers (correlation coefficients = 0.74), with a stronger influence in the overstory than in the understory, and a trade-off relationship observed between layers. Vertical GPP heterogeneity was well captured, with understory contributions ranging from 5.9% to 35.8%, except in sparse-canopy subarctic forests. Model estimates agreed well with flux tower data (understory contribution: correlation coefficient = 0.941, R2 = 0.885; total GPP: R2 = 0.785). This study offers new insights into the role of understory vegetation in carbon cycling and informs vertical-dimension strategies for forest carbon management."

 The remote detection of shallow, subsurface features can assist archaeological prospecting, environmental risk mitigation and national security. However, few subsurface detection studies have used geophysical methods to statistically validate the detection efficiency of broadband vegetation indices (VIs) in high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery. In this study, we use 37 broadband VIs on eight Maxar (now rebranded to Vantor) multispectral satellite images to remotely detect stressed meadow grass and anomalous soil characteristics over an Iron Age fogou (stone-walled underground passage) in Carn Euny, Cornwall, UK. Using Maxar’s high spatial resolution, the highest performing VIs are identified using a two-tier geophysical approach. First, we correlate the VIs with gravity and then, for a best performing image subset, we perform structural similarity index measurements (SSIMs) and 2D cross-correlations with ground penetrating radar (GPR) data. In doing so, we reprioritise the most suitable VIs for shallow, subsurface detection in temperate, grass covered environments. In summer months, the Iron Oxide index, Soil Salinity Index 7 (SI7) and the Structure Insensitive Pigment Index (SIPI) are most responsive across the fogou; all of which are algebraic manifestations of the Red/Blue reflectance ratio. By analysing their spectral profiles, gradient magnitudes, false colour composites (FCCs) and edge effects, we review the fogou’s effect on soil salinity, iron oxide concentration and chlorophyll production. Demonstrating the broader utility of Red/Blue reflectance ratios, we then present a multispectral image processing workflow which is calibrated to detect, at scale, shallow subsurface features in temperate, vegetated terrain."

 To investigate the concentration, sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and their impact on the formation of secondary particulate matter under different PM2.5 concentration levels in ambient air, a one-month online observation of ambient VOCs and PM2.5 concentrations was conducted in Chengdu, China during winter. The results showed that the concentrations of most VOC species increased significantly with the rising PM2.5 concentration. The Concentration and proportions of alkenes/alkynes, halocarbons, aromatics, and oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) all increased as PM2.5 concentrations rose, with alkenes and alkynes showing a more prominent increase. However, the proportion of alkanes decreased with increasing PM2.5 concentration, yet they still accounted for over 40 % of total VOCs concentrations. During moderately polluted period (PM2.5>115 μg/m3), the concentrations of isopentane, ethyl acetate, trans-2-butene, o-xylene, and 3-ethyltoluene were 9.5,7.4, 6.4, 6.2 and 6 times those in the excellent air quality period (PM2.5≤35 μg/m3), respectively, much higher than the 1.8-fold increase of CO. In contrast, the concentrations of 1-pentene and cis-2-pentene decreased instead of increasing, dropping by 75 % and 60 %, respectively. The concentrations of typical long-lived species remained essentially stable. Source apportionment results indicated that among the 8 sources of VOCs in ambient air, the concentration contributions and proportions of 4 sources, namely vehicle emissions, gas evaporation, solvent use, and domestic sources, all increased with the elevation of PM2.5 concentrations. During moderate pollution, their concentration contributions were 22.1 ppbv (34.3 %), 13.61 ppbv (21.7 %), 8.1 ppbv (11.5 %), and 7.8 ppbv (10.1 %), respectively. Among these, the concentration contribution of solvent use source during moderate pollution was 12.6 times that in the excellent air quality period, making it the source with the largest relative concentration contribution. The concentration contributions of the other 4 sources hardly changed with PM2.5 concentration. This indicated that industrial emissions, as well as biomass/waste combustion sources were effectively controlled throughout the pollution process, and no secondary formation sources of VOCs were detected during the winter pollution episodes. A comparison of changes in VOC species concentrations and their sources revealed that the increase in concentrations of reactive species with PM2.5 concentration was much lower than the increase in their source contributions, indicating significant chemical depletion. These findings suggested that the main sources driving the synchronous increase of PM2.5 and VOC concentration in ambient air are vehicle emissions, gas evaporation, solvent use, and domestic sources. These sources not only directly emit PM2.5 but also release chemically reactive substances such as alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons, which promote the conversion of PM2.5 into secondary PM2.5, leading to a sharp rise in ambient PM2.5 concentrations."

 Rapid intensification (RI) of tropical cyclones (TCs) near the China coast poses heightened risk because short lead times limit preparedness. Using ERA-Interim reanalysis, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission precipitation, and TC best-track data, we apply an obliquely rotated T-mode principal component analysis to classify synoptic environments for RI events and diagnose controlling factors with composites and a Box Difference Index. Four synoptic flow patterns emerge: (1) MSS: combined monsoon trough, subtropical high, and South Asian high; (2) MS: monsoon trough interacting with the subtropical high; (3) SH: subtropical-high-dominated; and (4) MW: monsoon trough with a southward-penetrating midlatitude westerly trough. Across regimes, RI is preceded by radius-of-maximum-wind contraction, increased TC fullness, and more axisymmetric inner-core precipitation. Further analyses show that MSS/MS feature reduced vertical wind shear and stronger low-level vorticity with enhanced precipitation; SH shows the weakest shear and strongest upper-level divergence as the ridge extends westward; MW favors already compact, intense storms that can withstand shear asymmetry tied to the midlatitude westerly trough. These results clarify how large-scale flow modulates RI onset near the China coast and suggest that combining synoptic-pattern recognition with environmental predictors can improve RI guidance for coastal warnings."

It is applied here to HCFC-141b. Calculated global emission trends are qualitatively consistent with atmospheric observations from 1990–2017. However, they diverge after 2017, suggesting either a growing additional source or a model deficiency. The easily recoverable portion of the bank is projected to be smaller than previously estimated, impacting future recovery feasibility. 
 The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer requires that the production of long-lived ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) that are intended for use in emissive applications be phased out. The Protocol does not, however, limit the release to the atmosphere of ODSs already existing in such applications and equipment. Accounting for emissions from these “banked” ODSs (e.g., in insulating foams) is important for monitoring the success of and compliance with the Protocol, for understanding where further mitigation of ODS emissions might be effective, and for estimating future ozone depletion. Here, we present a new bottom-up model that incorporates existing use and life-cycle information to calculate emissions and banks as well as uncertainties in the quantities. To demonstrate the model, we apply it to 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane (HCFC-141b), a chemical used primarily in foam insulation and whose production is currently being phased out. We calculate global emission trends that are qualitatively similar to those derived from atmospheric measurements from 1990 to 2017. After 2017, our calculated emissions no longer track the observationally based trends through the end of the comparison in 2021. This discrepancy suggests either a growing additional source of emissions that is inconsistent with reported production or a model deficiency that was not apparent before 2017. Our calculations also show that the easily recoverable portion of the bank will be smaller in the future than the total bank estimated in other recent work, with implications for the feasibility of recovering banks before the release of HCFC-141b to the atmosphere."

Despite these improvements, methane flux estimates from process-based models are still likely too high compared to atmospheric observations. We also find that models with simpler parameterizations often result in better agreement with atmospheric observations in high-latitude North America. 
 Methane (CH4) flux estimates from high-latitude North American wetlands remain highly uncertain in magnitude, seasonality, and spatial distribution. In this study, we evaluate a decade (2007–2017) of CH4 flux estimates by comparing 16 process-based models with atmospheric CH4 observations collected from in situ towers. We compare the Global Carbon Project (GCP) process-based models with a model inter-comparison from a decade earlier called The Wetland and Wetland CH4 Intercomparison of Models Project (WETCHIMP). Our analysis reveals that the GCP models have a much smaller inter-model uncertainty and have an average magnitude that is a factor of 1.5 smaller across Canada and Alaska. However, current GCP models likely overestimate wetland fluxes by a factor of two or more across Canada and Alaska based on tower-based atmospheric CH4 observations. The differences in flux magnitudes among GCP models are more likely driven by uncertainties in the amount of soil carbon or spatial extent of inundation than in temperature relationships, such as Q10 factors. The GCP models do not agree on the timing and amplitude of the seasonal cycle, and we find that models with a seasonal peak in July and August show the best agreement with atmospheric observations. Models that exhibit the best fit to atmospheric observation also have a similar spatial distribution; these models concentrate fluxes near Canada's Hudson Bay Lowlands. Current, state-of-the-art process-based models are much more consistent with atmospheric observations than models from a decade ago, but our analysis shows that there are still numerous opportunities for improvement."

We analyze data collected using MethaneAIR to assess methane emissions in regions accounting for 70 % of United States onshore oil/gas production in 2023. We estimate total oil/gas methane emissions across all measured regions to be ~8 Tg/yr, equivalent to 1.6 % of produced gas, which is five times higher than reported by the US Environmental Protection Agency. 
 Mitigation of methane emissions from the oil and gas sector is an effective way to reduce the near-term climate warming and losses of a valuable energy resource. The oil and gas value chain contributes at least 25 % of anthropogenic methane emissions globally and is the second largest methane-emitting sector in the United States. Here, we assess methane emissions in regions accounting for 70 % of US onshore oil and gas production in 2023 using data collected by the MethaneAIR airborne imaging spectrometer. We quantify total methane emissions across all observed regions to be ∼ 9 (7.8–10) Tg yr−1, with ∼ 90 % of emissions estimated from the oil and gas sector (∼ 8 Tg yr−1, equivalent to a methane loss rate of 1.6 % of gross gas production), which is about five times higher than reported by the US EPA. Both oil and gas emissions and gas production-normalized methane loss rates varied considerably by basin. Highly productive basins such as the Permian, Appalachian, and Haynesville-Bossier had the highest methane emissions (95–314 t h−1), whereas lower producing basins possibly associated with older infrastructure such as the Uinta and Piceance had higher loss rates (> 7 %). We found good agreement across total emissions quantified by MethaneAIR and other empirical and remote sensing estimates at national/basin/target-level scales. This work underscores the increasing value of remote sensing data for quantifying methane emissions, characterizing intensity of methane losses across the oil and gas sector, and mapping inter-basin emissions variability, which are all critical for tracking methane mitigation targets set by industry and governments."

We observed that particles originating near the surface are smaller than those falling from higher altitudes. Inland Antarctic particles of frozen fog occur at lower concentrations and are less complex than those observed in an urban, polluted environment. These findings can help to improve Antarctic climate models and to accurately interpret satellite observations of the polar atmosphere. 
 The Antarctic plateau, one of the coldest and cleanest regions of our planet, experiences almost exclusively frozen precipitation. Understanding the microphysical properties of inland Antarctic boundary layer ice particles with sizes below a few hundred micrometers is essential to improve atmospheric models and accurately validate remote sensing data for this region. Currently, only a small number of in situ atmospheric measurements exist for particle sizes smaller than 100 µm on the Antarctic plateau, performed over short measurement times. We present the first multi-week study of optical in situ measurements of boundary layer ice particle size, shape and morphological complexity for sizes down to 11 µm with a temporal resolution in the order of minutes, including a multi-day ice fog event. Classifying ice fog events with a lidar system, we found mean particle sizes smaller than 11 µm for ice fog events and of about 70 µm for cirrus precipitation and diamond dust events. The mean particle concentration of the ice fog at Dome C (3.9 L−1) is found to be lower than in parametrisations of Arctic ice fog and lower than the concentration of anthropogenically influenced urban ice fog measured at Fairbanks, Alaska during a three-year study with the same instrument (90 L−1). Moreover, ice fog particles at Dome C are found to be more pristine than at Fairbanks.  Our findings show that Antarctic boundary layer ice particles may need to be parametrised differently than their Arctic counterparts due to distinct conditions on the Antarctic plateau."

In our cloud chamber experiments, we found that for small ice crystals, the depolarisation ratio is more strongly influenced by particle size than by nano-scale structure. The measured trends could be reproduced with numerical simulations. This result helps improve the interpretation of remote sensing data and the accuracy of light scattering models. 
 Space-borne lidar, in combination with other remote sensing instrumentation, has been used to infer vertical profiles of ice cloud properties from A-train satellites, and more recently, also from the newly launched EarthCARE mission. However, accurately retrieving ice crystal microphysical properties from lidar signals requires a thorough understanding of their relationship to backscattering characteristics. Cloud chambers can be used to study the link under a controlled environment. This study investigates the link between the linear depolarisation ratio in the near-backscattering direction (178°) and the ice microphysical properties for 47 cloud experiments at cirrus temperatures between −75 and −39 °C. Predominantly small (diameter<70 µm) columnar and irregularly shaped ice crystals were grown under distinct conditions of supersaturation with respect to ice. A statistical and visual analysis of size, shape and morphological complexity reveals that more than 40 % of the columnar particles exhibit hollowness on the basal facets. Ice crystals larger than 10 µm show depolarisation ratios below 0.3, which is lower than typical values observed in mid-latitude cirrus but in agreement with polar cirrus observations. Two temperature-dependent depolarisation ratio–size modes were found and successfully reproduced with ray tracing simulations of hollow columns incorporating surface roughness, hollowness and internal scattering. These results are important for the interpretation of the linear depolarisation ratio of small ice crystals in active remote sensing or can be used for evaluating the performance of state-of-the-art optical particle models, especially for small size parameters below 100."

Using an improved atmospheric model, we show that changes in tiny airborne particles influence ozone differently in winter and summer: reduced particles boost winter ozone through sunlight-driven reactions, while summer ozone responds to chemical reactions on particle surfaces. These findings highlight the need to consider particle-ozone interactions in air quality and climate policies to avoid unintended effects. 
 Despite substantial reductions in PM2.5 and other pollutants, ozone (O3) in eastern China has increased over the past decade, yet the influence of aerosol processes – including aerosol–radiation interactions (ARI) and heterogeneous chemistry (HET) – on these trends remains insufficiently explored, particularly during Clean Air Action Plan (CAAP, Phase I: 2013–2017; Phase II: 2018–2020) and under carbon neutrality pathways. We applied a phase- and season-resolved WRF-Chem framework with explicit ARI and HET to quantify historical and projected O3 changes in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), linking aerosol effects with CAAP and carbon-neutrality pathways. We separate O3 changes into those driven directly by anthropogenic emissions and meteorological variability, and those mediated by aerosol processes through ARI and HET. The results revealed that anthropogenic emissions and meteorological variability respectively dominated winter and summer O3 increases. Winter O3 increases were dominated by ARI: large aerosol reductions enhanced solar radiation, temperature, and photolysis, resulting in a photochemical O3 rise (+1.14 (+0.74) ppb in Phase I (II)). Summer O3 was more sensitive to HET. In Phase I, aerosol decreases weakened heterogeneous radical uptake, enhancing O3 formation (+1.62 ppb). In Phase II, however, the net HET effect reversed sign (−2.86 ppb), driven by shifts in multiple heterogeneous pathways – including changes in radical uptake, HONO and N2O5 chemistry, and aerosol liquid water – rather than radical scavenging alone. Accounting for aerosol effects (AEs = ARI + HET), reductions in PM2.5 and NOx increased O3, while VOCs reductions consistently lowered O3 in both seasons. Under carbon peaking and neutrality scenarios with AEs, winter O3 increased by 6.7 % and 10.7 %, whereas summer O3 decreased by 2.9 % and 6.7 %, highlighting seasonally contrasting responses. These results underscore the necessity of explicitly accounting for multi-path aerosol–O3 interactions in both near-term air quality management and long-term climate mitigation to prevent unintended trade-offs and maximize co-benefits."

This study using unprecedented triple-frequency radar observations for the first time unravels the key snow growth processes over diverse geographies. The unique cross-continental datasets from triple-frequency campaigns shed new insights for model evaluation and future satellite missions. 
 Snow formation is a complex interplay of multiple microphysical growth processes, and the prevailing snow characteristics are inherently linked to local climate. However, the persistent shortage of observations for characterizing snow microphysics at a global scale continues to constrain our understanding of snow growth processes. Here, we investigate snow riming and aggregation signatures in stratiform precipitation through triple-frequency radar observations collected during coordinated field campaigns across Southern China, the Eastern United States, Western Europe, Northern Europe and Antarctica. The results suggest that the velocity-based riming estimates are generally consistent with triple-frequency observations, and the riming frequency increases with temperature. Our analysis of dual-frequency observations in these field campaigns qualitatively indicate the dendritic growth zone around −15 °C playing a key role in initiating enhanced snow size growth, and reveals a generally temperature-dependent snowflake growth characteristics. The snow over Eastern US is characterized by the most prominent riming growth, corresponding to moderate to heavy riming. Triple-frequency signatures of snowflakes over west Europe are consistent with Southern China, while the latter shows a higher degree of riming. The weakest snow growth signatures were found over west Antarctica, potentially owing to the scarcity of ice nucleating particles and available water vapor for deposition. In addition, our statistics reveal a latitudinal dependence for snowfall detection limitations with current spaceborne Ku- and Ka-band radars, and shed novel insights into future triple-frequency satellite missions as well as joint application of weather and spaceborne radars."

 Bioaerosol is a significant element of Particulate Matter (PM) and comprises various components, with bacterial species ranking as some of the most important. Reliable and consistent bioaerosol generators are essential for the investigation of bioaerosol in laboratory environments. Aerosol generators are utilized to evaluate the performance of bioaerosol collectors, explore the transport and deposition of biological particles, and study the health impacts and exposure to airborne microorganisms. The main goal of the bacteria experiments is to have an aerosol generator able to aerosolize the maximum number of viable and culturable cells at elevated particle concentrations. This study performs a comparative investigation of two bioaerosol generators: the Sparging Liquid Aerosol Generator (SLAG) by CH Technologies and the 1520 Flow Focusing Monodisperse Aerosol Generator (FMAG) by TSI. The analysis concentrated on the vitality, culturability, fragmentation, and nebulization efficiency of E. coli cells. The results indicated increased fragmentation using the SLAG nebulizer, and the size distribution varied according to the concentration of the injection fluid for FMAG. Both nebulizers imposed significant stress on bacteria during nebulization, halving their viability. Ultimately, the nebulization efficiency of FMAG is twenty times higher than that of SLAG."

By comparing stroke strength and timing, our new Current Ratio approach reveals flash initiation patterns in different storm types. The method is straightforward and data-driven, enabling physical insight without model-based analysis or prior assumptions, and supports regional lightning analysis and forecasting. 
 Lightning flashes play a key role in the global electrical circuit, serving as markers of deep convection and indicators of climate variability. However, this field of research remains challenging due to the wide range of physical processes and spatiotemporal scales involved.To address this challenge, this study utilizes the Lightning Differential Space (LDS), which maps lightning stroke intervals onto a parameter space defined by their temporal and spatial derivatives.Using data from the Earth Networks Total Lightning Network (ENTLN), we analyze the Number Distribution LDS clustering patterns across specific seasons in three climatically distinct regions: a tropical rainforest region (Amazon), a subtropical marine environment (Eastern Mediterranean Sea), and a mid-latitude continental region (Great Plains in the U.S.). The LDS reveals a robust clustering topography composed of “allowed” and “forbidden” interval ranges, which are consistent across regions, while shifts in cluster position and properties reflect the underlying regional meteorological conditions.As an extension of the LDS framework, we introduce the Current Ratio LDS, a new diagnostic for identifying flash initiation by mapping the ratio of peak currents between successive strokes into the LDS coordinate space. This space reveals a spatiotemporal structure that enables a clearer distinction between local and regional scales. It also reveals a distinct cluster, suggesting a possible teleconnection between remote strokes, spanning tens to hundreds of kilometers.Together, the Number Distribution LDS and the novel Current Ratio LDS provide a scalable, data-driven framework for analyzing and interpreting large datasets of CG lightning activity. This approach strengthens the ability to characterize multiscale lightning behavior, offers a framework for evaluating model representations of stroke and flash processes, and provides a basis for developing diagnostics relevant to operational monitoring and forecasting of lightning activity."

Our study reveals that the plant blooms widely during wet years and is often found near roads and moist areas.

 Yellow sweetclover (Melilotus officinalis (L.) Lam.; MEOF) is an invasive forb pervasive across the Northern Great Plains in the United States, often linked to traits such as wide adaptability, strong stress tolerance, and high productivity. Despite MEOF's prevalent ecological-economic impacts and importance, knowledge of its spatial distribution and temporal evolution is extremely limited. Here, we aim to develop a spatial database of annual MEOF abundance (2016–2023) across western South Dakota (SD) at 10 m spatial resolution by applying a generalized prediction model on Sentinel-2 imagery. We collected in situ quadrat-based total vegetation cover with MEOF percent cover estimates across western SD from 2021 through 2023 and synthesized with other available percent cover estimates (2016–2022) of several federal, state, and non-governmental sources. We conducted drone overflights at 14 sites across Butte County, SD in 2023 to develop very high spatial resolution (4–6 cm) and accurate MEOF cover maps by applying a random forest (RF) classification model. The field-measured and uncrewed aerial system (UAS) derived MEOF percent cover estimates were used to train, test, and validate a RF regression model. The predicted MEOF percent cover dataset was validated with UAS-derived percent cover in 2023 across four sites (out of 14 sites). We found that the variation in the Normalized Difference Moisture Index and Distance to roads were among the top predicting variables in predicting MEOF abundance. Our predictive model yielded greater accuracies with an R2 of 0.76, RMSE of 15.11 %, MAE of 10.95 %, and MAPE of 1.06 %. We further validated our 2023 predicted maps using the 3 m resolution PlanetScope imagery for regions where field samples could not be collected in 2023. The database of MEOF abundance showed consecutive years of average or above-average precipitation yielded a higher MEOF abundance across the study region. The database could assist local land managers and government officials pinpoint locations requiring timely land management to control the rapid spread of MEOF in the Northern Great Plains.

The maps show forest expansion, cropland expansion, and bare land reduction, together with a 30 % decline in mean soil erosion. 
 Unsustainable human activities have driven global ecological degradation. In China, decades of restoration policies have been implemented to reverse this trend in severely degraded regions with catastrophic soil erosion, transforming them into landscapes of ecological recovery. However, the evolution of soil erosion in these regions remains poorly quantified due to the absence of high-resolution, long-term, and high-frequency monitoring data. Here, to address this gap and provide a reliable spatiotemporal benchmark dataset, we conducted the first 10-m quarterly wall-to-wall land change mapping for China's flagship ecological restoration site: the Loess Plateau, based on the developed cross-temporal consistency-constraint deep learning framework. The dataset was generated using over 10 terabytes of Sentinel and Landsat imagery and documents land-cover dynamics across 100 quarterly time steps from 2000 to 2024, showing an overall accuracy of 81.44 % based on 40,000 annotated samples and 79.8 % for third-party validation sources. The resulting maps record pronounced land-cover dynamics, including forest expansion (+13,131 km2), cropland expansion (+28,095 km2), and bare land reduction (-65,029 km2) over the past decades. Furthermore, the produced dataset was combined with environmental factors to measure the 25-year quarter-level soil erosion, where comparison with government survey data shows strong consistency, with a mean absolute error of 4.50 %. The dataset further illustrates that long-term ecological interventions have substantially reduced erosion intensity in the region by 30 % over the past 25 years, from 13.34 to 9.35 t/(hm2·a). Based on this benchmark, the long-term, fine-grained soil erosion becomes possible to estimate. The data-driven analysis indicates that current erosion is most severe in the central and southwestern Loess Plateau, and scenario modeling based on multiple factors suggests that optimized vegetation distribution – including grassland expansion and cropland-to-forest conversion – could potentially reduce future erosion intensity to 6.42 t/(hm2·a). This dataset provides a comprehensive benchmark for erosion mitigation in the Loess Plateau and its underlying drivers, providing critical insights for sustainable land management, ecological restoration, and policy development both in China and across fragile ecosystems worldwide.

We use data from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite to build a new product that cleans the raw microwave signal and yields more reliable estimates of soil moisture and vegetation water content. Tests against ground stations and other satellites show that the new record exceeds existing products and can support applications such as drought, freeze–thaw, and carbon monitoring. 
 The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission delivers the first multi-angular L-band observations for retrieving global soil moisture (SM) and vegetation optical depth (VOD), two critical variables for understanding terrestrial water and carbon cycles. However, the combined effects of non-identical fields of view and aliasing in multi-angular SMOS brightness temperature (TB) observations can introduce noise and biases when the TBs are averaged to a nominal incidence angle, as done in the SMOS L3 dataset, thereby degrading land parameter retrievals. To address this issue, an optimized SMOS TB dataset was initially produced at a fixed 40° incidence angle, consistent with the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. We then developed the first SMOS mono-angular SM and VOD products designed to achieve performance comparable to SMAP and improved relative to conventional multi-angle SMOS retrievals. The 40° TB optimization was performed using the L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere (L-MEB) model, and the inversion relied on the SMAP-INRAE-BORDEAUX (SMAP-IB) algorithm, yielding a global 40° SMOS TB record and associated SM and VOD products for 2010–2024 at 25 km spatial resolution, collectively referred to as SMOS-IB. Results showed that the optimized 40° TB reached a performance level comparable to SMAP and improved relative to SMOS-L3, both in its sensitivity to in-situ SM from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) and in the reduction of global pixel-scale noise. When multiple evaluation metrics are considered, the SMOS-IB SM and VOD data, benefiting from the use of the optimized TB as input and a newly optimized soil roughness (Hr) parameterization, showed improved performance compared with those derived from SMOS L3 40° TB or from the multi-angular SMOS products. The SMOS-IB TB, SM and VOD products can be used for L-band algorithm development and SMAP harmonization, global drought monitoring, and studies of vegetation water and biomass dynamics.

Covering a larger footprint (~30 ha) than the existing long-term 3 m measurements, it enables landscape-scale flux estimation, improved alignment with satellite observations, and supports studies of ecosystem modelling and satellite product validation. 
 The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is warming rapidly, with future projections suggesting continued warming that may amplify climate–carbon feedbacks. However, sparse in-situ observations and pronounced spatial heterogeneity in vegetation, soil moisture, and climate have limited our understanding of these ecosystem responses. Here, we present a continuous record of carbon and energy fluxes measured at a landscape scale (~30 ha / 0.3 km2) in an alpine steppe ecosystem on the TP from July 2018 to June 2019. Flux measurements were quality-filtered and gap-filled to produce a complete seasonal record using two complementary approaches, marginal distribution sampling (MDS) and random forest (RF). Eddy covariance measurements represent integrated fluxes over their footprint area, which are often much smaller than most model grids or remote sensing pixels, particularly in grassland ecosystems. Owing to the higher measurement height (19 m) at this site, the measurement footprint closely aligns with the spatial resolution of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products, facilitating more consistent landscape-scale comparisons. The data include quality flags indicating observed or gap-filled values, uncertainty estimates, footprint diagnostics, and auxiliary meteorological variables. The data described in this manuscript provides a robust foundation for examining carbon–climate interactions in alpine environments, supporting ecosystem modeling and satellite product validation."

These data were harmonized with a crop taxonomy and then linked to other classification systems including agricultural statistics and remotely sensed products. This dataset can support researchers and policy makers in tracking changes over time, calculating crop rotations, for national comparisons, for evaluating official statistics and for remote sensing. 
 As part of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Union (EU), farmers make annual declarations of the agricultural activities for which they receive subsidies. The declarations include the crops they grow at parcel level, referred to as Geo-Spatial Application (GSA) data. Paying Agencies (PA) of every EU Member State (MS) use specific crop classifications in their native language, and not all provide access to the GSA data. In the past, the EuroCrops initiative harmonized openly available GSA data for a single year (2021) using the Hierarchical Crop and Agriculture Taxonomy (HCAT), but multiple years are available depending on the country. Harmonizing a time series of farmers' crop declarations at parcel level would allow for comparative spatiotemporal analysis across the EU, the development of indicators that can be used for CAP and other policy monitoring purposes, and would provide data for training and validation of remotely sensed products. Here we have collected the GSA crop type declarations and parcel geometries that are publicly available from 18 PAs, the administrative bodies managing GSA data, for a minimum of three years. We have then harmonized the GSA data using HCAT v.4, a new version developed as part of this work. The data set includes nearly 47 million parcels covering 21 Mha. To facilitate integration and interoperability of the GSA data with other EU data sets containing spatial information on crops, we harmonized the crop classes used in the following data sets with HCAT v.4: 1) LUCAS, 2) the Integrated Farm Statistics/Farm Structure Survey, 3) the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN), and 4) the classification systems of the Copernicus High Resolution Layer on Crop Types. To demonstrate the potential of the multiannual, harmonised dataset presented in this paper, the GSA data were aggregated to NUTS 2 regions and compared with statistics on crop areas from Eurostat, showing good correspondence for many crops but also highlighting those crops and countries where the agreement is less good, providing possible reasons why. The data can also be used for mapping crop rotations, and a map showing maize monoculture illustrates this application.

Performance tests demonstrated that graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration make such high-resolution simulations feasible within practical timeframes. 
 Pushing global climate models to large-eddy simulation (LES) scales over complex terrain has remained a major challenge. This study presents the first known implementation of a global model – SCREAM (Simple Cloud-Resolving E3SM Atmosphere Model) – at 100 m horizontal resolution using a regionally refined mesh (RRM) over the San Francisco Bay Area. Two hindcast simulations were conducted to test performance under both strong synoptic forcing and weak, boundary-layer-driven conditions. We demonstrate that SCREAM can stably run at LES scales while realistically capturing topography, surface heterogeneity, and coastal processes. The 100 m SCREAM-RRM substantially improves near-surface wind speed, temperature, humidity, and pressure biases compared to the baseline 3.25 km simulation, and better reproduces fine-scale wind oscillations and boundary-layer structures. These advances leverage SCREAM's scale-aware SHOC turbulence parameterization, which transitions smoothly across scales without tuning. Performance tests show that while CPU-only simulations remain costly, GPU acceleration with SCREAMv1 on NERSC's Perlmutter system enables two-day hindcasts to complete in under two wall-clock days. Our results open the door to LES-scale studies of orographic flows, boundary-layer turbulence, and coastal clouds within a fully comprehensive global modeling framework."

This study systematically analyzed the spatiotemporal evolution of ozone pollution during heatwaves and its compound impacts on health and crops using national ozone monitoring data from 2015 to 2024 and the ERA5 reanalysis dataset. Results demonstrate substantial ozone concentration increases in the Fenwei Plain (FP), Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) region, Sichuan Basin (SB), Yangtze River Middle Reaches Urban Agglomerations (YRMRU), and Yangtze River Delta (YRD) (with a slight decrease in the Pearl River Delta (PRD)). In the SB, YRD, YRMRU, BTH, and PRD, the average annual growth rate of nighttime average ozone concentration (NTAvg) exceeds that of daytime average ozone concentration (DTAvg), while the opposite pattern is observed in the FP. Nationwide ozone exposure caused total yield losses of 5.84 million tons for wheat, rice, and maize, with associated economic losses approximating USD 2.98 billion. During concurrent heatwave and ozone exceedance events, the highest population-attributable fractions (PAFs) for three major disease categories were observed in BTH, Shanxi, and Shandong (PAF > 2%). Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop coordinated air quality improvement strategies that address both heatwaves and ozone pollution."

This study presents a detailed assessment of their representation across three generations of global reanalysis products (ERA5, ERA‐Interim, and ERA40) from the European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts, paired with a hierarchy of simulations at different grid resolutions with the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2). Using the high‐resolution (2.5‐km resolution) Copernicus Arctic Regional Reanalysis (CARRA) as a benchmark, we find that the global reanalysis data sets systematically underestimate wind speeds (around 30% in ERA5 and 50% in ERA‐Interim and ERA40) and fail to capture key structural features of these regional storms. Similar deficiencies are observed in CESM2 simulations when using standard latitude‐longitude grids at 1–2° ${}^{\circ}$ horizontal resolutions, which is a common model configuration used in recent iterations of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects. Variable‐resolution configurations in CESM2 with enhanced representation of the Greenland topography demonstrate a marked improvement in capturing the strength and structure of these regional storms. Sensitivity simulations further confirm that steeper ice‐sheet margins (better resolved at higher spatial resolution) are crucial for accurately representing katabatic acceleration. These findings underscore the importance of spatial resolution and realistic topographic representation in simulating local climate extremes. Accurately capturing such events is vital not only for understanding modern climate dynamics on and around the polar ice sheets, but likely also for simulating realistic ice sheet/Earth system interactions in glacial climates of the past."

Logan, the second highest peak in North America located in the St. Elias mountains in southwest Yukon, Canada, have provided conflicting accumulation records, thus the hydroclimate response to changing atmospheric conditions in the highest elevation regions is not well constrained. Here, we present the accumulation record from the new 325 m Mt. Logan ice core drilled at 5,334 m asl on the summit plateau in May 2022. Multi‐parameter annual layer counting, confirmed with radionuclide and volcanic tephra measurements, extends to 1911 CE, associated with a depth of 257 m. The thinning‐corrected annual accumulation record reveals an average rate of 3.0 m water equivalent per year (m weq a−1) from 1912 to 2020 CE, greater than six times higher than the previous estimate of ∼0.41 m weq a−1 from the 2002 Mt. Logan Prospector Russell Col core. Correlation analysis between the annual accumulation record and regional climate data sets (e.g., Japanese 55‐year Reanalysis, weather stations) reveal a strong positive relationship with warm‐season total precipitable water and temperature. Thus, we suggest interdecadal precipitation variability on Mt. Logan is at least partially driven by warm‐season atmospheric water vapor loading, potentially related to atmospheric temperature responses associated with the warm‐season Alaska Blocking Index. Further, the record reveals a statistically significant increase in accumulation of 0.13 m weq per decade since 1970. These results reveal a drastically different Mt.

It manifests pronounced spatial heterogeneity when these jet centers experience asynchronous variations. However, previous researches about this heterogeneity are still limited. This study examines the long‐term variability of the spatial heterogeneity of SWJ during boreal summer (July–August) over recent 40 years, particular for the decadal changes. Three centers with high wind speed along SWJ, respectively located over Atlantic, West Asia and East Asia (short for ATJ, WAJ and EAJ) exhibit marked spatial heterogeneity in their temporal evolution. Both of ATJ and WAJ demonstrate the equatorward shifts, while EAJ shows poleward shift. This zonal heterogeneity is particularly pronounced on the decadal time scale, with all three centers have phase transitions in their meridional displacements around 1998. The decadal changes in the atmospheric circulation before and after 1998 encompass the circulation anomalies caused by the individual meridional displacements of the three jet centers. Meanwhile, the combined circulation anomalies caused by these jet centers closely match the decadal change of the atmospheric circulation. This provides compelling evidence for a strong dynamical connection between the atmospheric circulation and the heterogeneous variation of SWJ. The phase transitions of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, combined with the rapid retreat of Arctic sea ice, influence the decadal changes in the spatial heterogeneity of SWJ by modulating the meridional temperature gradient."

Chemical transport models and emission inventories are widely used to study the emission, transport, and chemical transformation of NH3. However, traditional static inventories consider emissions as unidirectional, overlooking interactions between NH3 emissions and other ecosystems, especially land surface processes linked to emissions. In this study, we achieved bidirectional NH3 exchange between land surface and atmospheric chemistry models by developing WRF‐CN‐Chem, a model integrating the Noah‐MP land surface model with carbon‐nitrogen dynamics (Noah‐MP‐CN) and the Weather Research and Forecasting model with atmospheric chemistry (WRF‐Chem). Compared with the static Multi‐resolution Emission Inventory for China, the dynamic bidirectional model exhibits higher spatiotemporal resolution and demonstrated a stronger temporal correlation with satellite observations. WRF‐CN‐Chem model estimated 7.88 TgN NH3 emission in year 2020 in eastern China. Additionally, we incorporated the atmospheric nitrogen deposition, simulated by the “Online” experiment, into the soil ammonium pool. Our findings revealed an increase of 2.25 TgC yr−1 in land net primary productivity (NPP) in eastern China attributable to the increased nitrogen deposition. By incorporating bidirectional NH3 exchange between land surface and atmosphere chemistry models, this study enhances the simulation of dynamic ammonia emissions and improves understanding of atmospheric nitrogen deposition processes. Furthermore, linking these processes to land NPP provides valuable insights for sustainable land management and pollution mitigation strategies, helping address the environmental impacts of excessive fertilization."

Response of O3 to CHWD is complicated by the vegetation‐atmosphere feedbacks through influencing biogenic emissions and stomatal deposition. Here, we employed a regional meteorology‐chemistry‐vegetation coupled model, integrated with optimized drought emission algorithm and interactive dry deposition scheme, to investigate the vegetation‐atmosphere feedbacks and their effects on O3 pollution during CHWD. Analysis shows that CHWD have intensified in the northern hemisphere, with more frequent occurrence, stronger intensity and longer duration compared to the average climatology. Unusually elevated O3 levels and exceedance frequency by more than 20% compared to normal conditions were observed during CHWD in the United States, western Europe and China. Model results indicate that heatwaves and droughts jointly lead to 10%–24% increase of summertime biogenic volatile organic compound emissions in vegetated regions, except in the severely drought‐affected areas. Furthermore, extremely hot and dry conditions induce stomatal closure and suppress plant growth, inhibiting O3 stomatal removal by water‐stressed vegetation. It is estimated that such intricate vegetation‐atmosphere feedbacks substantially exacerbate O3 pollution during CHWD, with equal importance to that of increased photochemical rates. Our findings offer a novel perspective on the interactions between climate, vegetation, and chemistry regarding compound extreme weather events."

This evaluation of TEMPO's first year demonstrates the capability of total formaldehyde column retrievals (ΩHCHO, version 3) at different locations, seasons, and meteorological conditions. The ΩHCHO product is assessed using 36 ground‐based Pandora direct‐sun measurements from Pandonia Global Network (PGN) as a reference data set. The 36 PGN sites were chosen for consistency in direct‐sun and sky‐scan measurement modes. In the first year of operation (Aug 2023–Sep 2024), TEMPO ΩHCHO exhibits moderate to strong agreement at PGN sites in both measurement modes (R2 = 0.63 to 0.85). TEMPO shows a negligible bias of −2 ± 20% at lower ΩHCHO (<1.0 × 1016 molecule cm−2) and a larger underestimation of −22 ± 5% at higher ΩHCHO (>1.5 × 1016 molecule cm−2). TEMPO clearly captures the seasonal variability of ΩHCHO, with summer values being greatest and winter, spring, and fall values being lower by − 62%, − 45%, and − 29%, respectively. TEMPO shows no consistent bias at any time of day with excellent agreement with Pandora for different meteorological conditions. For all hourly differences between TEMPO and Pandora, 96% fall within 1 × 1016 molecules cm−2.

To address this challenge, this work presents an integrated methodology for PM2.5 source apportionment in Bhopal, central India, combining dispersion‐normalized positive matrix factorization (DN‐PMF) with a machine‐learning interpretability approach using Random Forest and SHAP (RF‐SHAP). DN‐PMF improves conventional source identification by incorporating air dilution effects, yielding refined source contributions for nine factors in Bhopal. Seasonal factor contributions peaked during periods with a lower boundary layer height, such as secondary sulfate during the winter season (21.3 μg m−3, 31.7%). The COVID‐19 lockdowns, a quasi‐natural emissions reduction experiment, led to a decrease in aerosol contributions from industrial, residential and traffic‐related sources. However, during this period, crop residue burning was exposed as a major anthropogenic contributor, which together with unfavorable meteorology resulted in increased mean PM2.5 (50.6 ± 24.3 μg m−3) during the lockdowns compared to the reference period (36.7 ± 9.7 μg m−3).

Secondary nitrate and residential fuel were identified as key contributors to exceedances of the Indian National Ambient Air Quality Standards (60 μg m−3, 24‐hr average) at the study site. Integrating DN‐PMF with RF‐SHAP (driver analysis) enhanced source attribution by linking source contributions with their driving factors, establishing a framework for assessing pollution dynamics.

 Climate action ameliorates public health by reducing hazardous air pollutants alongside greenhouse gases, yet misguided mitigation efforts could induce imbalances in air pollution exchange across international borders. Despite its potential to endanger equality, the effects from climate action on transboundary air pollution are relatively unstudied. Here we show that stricter mitigation increases the fraction of co-benefits that originate externally in Africa by +8% in shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP) towards sustainability (SSP1) and by +53% for fragmentation (SSP3). The fraction of externally originating co-benefits is greater in developing countries (0.76 in SSP1-26) than developed (0.65), indicating that developing countries are more dependent on external action. Although co-benefits are maximized in the most ambitious scenario, SSP1-19 (1.32 million deaths avoided), their transboundary exchange between countries varies. These results suggest a need for climate policies that consider how inequalities in transboundary air pollution evolve across distinct socioeconomic trends and mitigation strategies in addition to total co-benefit estimates.

 Renewable energy is critical for addressing global climate change, and accurate assessments of its potential are key for decision making and planning. This study provides a detailed, farm-level evaluation of offshore wind power potential in China, incorporating realistic turbine layouts derived from remote sensing data, wake loss modeling, and future climate scenarios.

 Accurate projections of heating and cooling demands are crucial for advancing towards the sustainable development goals. Here we present a global dataset of heating degree days (HDDs) and cooling degree days (CDDs) for 3 levels of global mean temperature rise above pre-industrial conditions—1.0 °C (2006–2016), 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C—regardless of the pathways leading to these warming scenarios. The dataset comprises 30 gridded maps (0.883° × 0.556° resolution) characterizing climate variability through 5 statistical metrics per variable and scenario over a representative 10-year period. The dataset reveals a widespread decline in HDDs and a pronounced, nonlinear increase in CDDs, with the most significant shifts in climate intensity and adaptation needs emerging early in the warming trajectory. Furthermore, using the ‘middle-of-the-road’ Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5 as a reference, the dataset indicates that the population experiencing extreme heat conditions (exceeding 3,000 CDDs) is projected to nearly double if the 2.0 °C threshold is reached, increasing from 23% (1.54 billion people) in 2010 to 41% (3.79 billion) by 2050, with the largest projected populations affected in India, Nigeria, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and the Philippines.

 Artificial intelligence has improved the accuracy and efficiency of weather forecasting, surpassing traditional numerical weather prediction models. However, the coarse spatial resolution of global weather forecasting systems limits their ability to capture fine-scale surface heterogeneity and localized extremes, particularly in regions with complex terrain or urban heat island effects. Here, we introduce SR-Weather, a deep learning-based super-resolution framework that converts coarse 0.25° forecasts into 1-km surface air temperature fields using MODIS-derived temperature targets and high-resolution auxiliary inputs. SR-Weather outperforms existing super-resolution methods by explicitly incorporating spatial context, such as topography, impervious surface fraction, and seasonal climatology maps of air temperature. When SR-Weather was applied to the FuXi global weather forecast, the 7-day forecast error in South Korea decreased by more than 20%, which was comparable to the 1-day forecast error from low-resolution prediction using simple spatial interpolation. In addition, SR-Weather effectively reconstructs missing pixels in MODIS-derived air temperature maps under heavy cloud contamination by leveraging auxiliary variables and climatologically smoothed fields. Although validated over South Korea, the framework relies on globally available MODIS products and minimal auxiliary inputs, making it feasible to retrain for other regions.

 Forest fire smoke significantly disrupts regional carbon cycles and degrades air quality, highlighting an urgent need for highly sensitive detection and inversion models to improve early warning systems. This study proposes a physics-based remote sensing framework for smoke detection and concentration inversion, founded on scattering–absorption theory. By employing multi-dimensional spectral point cluster analysis based on a smoke scattering–absorption model, we introduce the Mahalanobis Distance (MD) as a physically interpretable measure of spectral deviation. A physical relationship between MD and smoke concentration is derived, which serves as the foundation for a dual-threshold detection algorithm and an inversion model. The proposed approach is validated through laboratory experiments, UAV-based simulations, and satellite observations. Key findings include: (1) Smoke clusters migrate quasi-linearly from background to the ideal smoke point with increasing concentration, while their spatial extent contracts exponentially; (2) MD exhibits a double-exponential correlation with smoke concentration (RMSE = 0.18 g/m2, R2 = 0.80); (3) Detection accuracy reaches 0.89–0.97 (UAV) and 0.93 (satellite), with fire localization errors of 0.52 ± 0.35 m and 45.47 ± 42.22 m, respectively. These results confirm that spectral variation is a core parameter for smoke retrieval, and MD provides a robust, physically grounded measure for detection and inversion. The proposed model overcomes key limitations of empirical threshold methods and offers a scalable solution for early forest fire monitoring across platforms."

However, an evaluation of nine CMIP6 models reveals substantial inconsistencies: in some models, mrsos and integrated mrsol agree globally; in others, they align only in specific regions; and in a few, they diverge across all grid cells. These discrepancies arise from a combination of factors, including metadata errors, inconsistent variable definitions, or diagnostic sequencing within the model. We demonstrate how such issues can lead to significant biases, even when both variables are present and seemingly well-defined. As model complexity increases and multi-model comparisons become more common, assumptions about variable equivalence may lead to flawed conclusions. This study highlights the need for routine consistency checks, improved metadata standards, and community-wide practices that ensure reliability of derived variables across ESM outputs, particularly in preparation for CMIP7."

However, deforestation and increasingly frequent droughts, heatwaves and wildfires threaten these rainforests. Amazonian fires are generally assumed to be entirely anthropogenic, which has led to lightning-ignited fires being underexplored. Here, we present the first detailed assessment of the spatiotemporal patterns of lightning-ignited fires in the Amazon rainforest to elucidate the role of lightning and human ignitions in shaping Amazon fire dynamics. To do this, we matched cloud-to-ground lightning strokes from the Global Lightning Dataset (GLD360) with individual fire events between 2019 and 2024 to obtain a probability of lightning ignition for each fire. We also calculated a human-ignition probability index using proximity to roads, waterways, and human land cover as proxies for human activity. By combining both probabilistic indices with ground-observed lightning ignitions from eight protected areas, we could optimize the threshold that determines if an ignition is more likely to be caused by lightning or human activities. We estimate that in the Brazilian Amazon, lightning caused on average 0.2%–0.4% of all fires each year (234–407 ignitions per year) and 1.1%–1.2% of the annually burned area (1226–1358 km2 per year) between 2019 and 2024. More than 89% of these fires occurred in the late dry season between August and November, peaking in September and October. Despite lightning-ignited fires contributing a small proportion of all Amazonian fires, they constitute over 25% of the fires in identified grid clusters in parts of the states of Pará (particularly in the Breves region), Amazonas, and Rondônia. This study provides the first estimation of the role of natural ignitions in Amazon fire dynamics and a scientific basis for understanding their contribution within the region."

Under similar radiative forcing, particularly during daytime and clear-sky conditions, its temporal variability is expected to be coupled to surface conditions such as availability of soil moisture and plant functional conditions. In this study, we use Earth observations to identify regions with a strong interannual co-variability between the diurnal amplitude of land surface temperature and surface soil moisture. Land surface temperature is taken from the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites Applications Facility on Land Surface Analysis and soil moisture from the Copernicus Climate Change Service for the period 2004–2023 over the 0° Meteosat Second Generation region, encompassing Africa and Europe. We introduce a new metric to quantify the soil moisture-temperature interannual co-variability in the satellite data, which is then applied to evaluate the fifth reanalysis from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ERA5). Earth observations and ERA5 show similar spatial co-variability patterns across much of the domain, highlighting regions of transition between climate zones. However, ERA5 shows weaker co-variability in regions with large interannual vegetation variability. These findings suggest that accurately capturing the interannual variability of land surface temperature and its co-variability with soil moisture, in regions with large vegetation variability, may require a dynamic representation of vegetation status, beyond the mean annual cycles currently implemented in ERA5."

However, the sensitivity of scientific outcomes to dataset choice remains poorly understood, and evaluation using station-based records can favor datasets built heavily on weather stations. Here, we evaluate seven high-resolution daily gridded datasets covering the contiguous United States using independent meteorology from the FLUXNET2015 dataset, with a focus on the implications of dataset choice for process-based tree growth modeling. We find that gridded products tend to capture temperature accurately while consistently overestimating the magnitude and frequency of precipitation and its extremes. Moreover, datasets vary in how they define a ‘day,’ which significantly affects temporal alignment with FLUXNET2015 observations. Despite differences among the datasets, the interannual variability in tree ring simulations is insensitive to dataset choice, likely because daily-scale biases are averaged out through accumulated growth across several months. However, inaccuracies in temperature and precipitation can significantly bias modeled xylem cell production, with systematically higher annual precipitation in the gridded datasets leading to greater xylem production compared to simulations using in situ data. Our results suggest that model applications, especially those that integrate to time scales longer than one day, are likely insensitive to climate dataset choice, but applications that are sensitive to daily climate variations or to absolute climate values need to carefully consider biases in gridded climate products."

In the Dutch Southwest Delta, coastal management has turned tidal waters into marine lakes. The ensuing stagnation and stratification in combination with eutrophication has caused a decline in water quality, including decreased oxygen (O2) saturation. Restoring such systems is challenging as exemplified by Lake Veere, which was reconnected to the tidal marine Eastern Scheldt, via a culvert, two decades ago. After an initial improvement, water quality strongly declined again in recent years. Here, we investigate the consequences of the restoration effort on coastal deoxygenation by leveraging existing monitoring data of oxygen, temperature, salinity, and benthic macroinvertebrates. In addition, we quantified the O2 demand of the sediment at selected sites via field measurements. Water quality monitoring data indicate that the restored tidal influence resulted in strong improvements in O2 saturation of bottom waters. However, improvements were confined to the eastern part nearby the inflow of marine water. Modelled bottom water O2 concentrations and observed benthic macroinvertebrate densities are related, and show reduced densities under low-O2, especially for less mobile infauna. This highlights the detrimental effect of deoxygenation on benthic faunal communities. Geochemical analyses reveal a very high sedimentary O2 demand, mainly caused by high concentrations of the reduced solutes ammonium and hydrogen sulphide (H2S). These solutes are toxic and are formed by anaerobic (re)mineralization of organic matter. Furthermore, low availability of easily reducible iron-oxides in the lake sediments mutes the formation of iron-sulphides, explaining high porewater H2S concentrations, and release of H2S into bottom waters. Combined, our results illustrate the challenge of restoring a coastal ecosystem by increasing lateral oxygen supply without addressing the legacy effects of eutrophication in the sediments, reemphasizing the importance of nutrient reductions in restoration strategies."

Although the natural gas leakage rate is not high (1.12 %), the greenhouse effect caused by natural gas leakage can not be ignored. 
 Natural gas will continue to replace coal in the process of global energy structure reform, but its leakage potential can delay the realization of global carbon neutrality. To quantify its impact, we established a carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) flux detection platform on the 220 m platform of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, located in northwestern Beijing. The observation results indicated that the daily mean CO2 and CH4 fluxes were 12.21 ± 1.75 µmol m−2 s−1  and 95.54 ± 18.92 nmol m−2 s−1, respectively. The fluxes were significantly correlated with natural gas consumption, indicating that natural gas has become a common source of CH4 and CO2, the combustion of which releases CO2, while its leakage processes emit CH4. Vehicle-based identification demonstrated that CH4 can escape at the production, storage and use stages of natural gas. Based on natural gas consumption data, the upper limit of the calculated natural gas leakage rate in Beijing reached 1.12 % ± 0.22 %, indicating that the contribution of CH4 to climate change could reach 23 % of that of CO2 on a 20-year scale. Natural gas leakage was estimated to delay the time for China to achieve carbon neutrality by at least almost four years."

Bednarz,"Air quality impacts of stratospheric aerosol injections are likely small and mainly driven by changes in climate, not aerosol settling","Stratospheric aerosol injection is a proposed method to slow global warming by adding tiny reflective particles high up in the atmosphere to cool the planet. We study how this proposed method might affect air quality and human health using climate models. We find that the health impacts would likely be small and are mainly driven by changes in climate, not by the particles themselves. 
 Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) is a proposed climate intervention method to offset future global warming through increased solar reflection in the stratosphere, but its broader environmental and public health implications are yet to be thoroughly explored. We use three large ensembles of fully coupled CESM2-WACCM6 simulations to assess changes in mortality attributable to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and surface ozone exposure (O3). Maintaining temperatures at 1.5 °C above preindustrial levels through SAI is projected to yield a modest 0.4 % (ensemble range: −1.9 % to +1.5 %) reduction in pollution-related mortality relative to middle-of-the-road climate change scenario, reflecting a 1.3 % (−2.3 % to −0.6 %) reduction in ozone-related deaths and a 0.9 % (−0.4 % to +2.1 %) increase in PM2.5-related deaths. The spread among ensemble members underscores the influence of internal variability and highlights the importance of ensemble-based analyses when assessing the potential health impacts of climate intervention strategies. We find that global PM2.5 mortality changes exhibit little sensitivity to injected sulfate amounts, with the most variability driven by precipitation-mediated changes in non-sulfate PM2.5 species (e.g., dust and secondary organic aerosols), whereas ozone-related mortality is primarily driven by surface cooling and hemispheric asymmetries in stratospheric-tropospheric exchange and ozone transport. However, our results heavily reflect the specific forcing patterns of the SAI scenarios used; our estimates are also limited by model shortcomings, including omitting the effects of aerosols in the photolysis scheme – which might limit UV-driven changes and impact surface ozone rates – or not including nitrate aerosols. Within our framework, we find that SAI impacts on pollution-related mortality are modest but regionally heterogeneous, and that the magnitude of the SAI-driven changes is smaller than the improvements expected from near-term air quality policies planned or implemented within the same time frame."

However, they remain incompletely understood, representing a major source of uncertainty in the predictive performance of climate models. We show that  consistency between in situ measurements of cirrus cloud microphysics and ground-based remote sensing observations is achievable by simulating the emitted spectrum using current parameterizations of cirrus optical properties. 
 This paper explores whether it is possible to achieve consistency between ground-based infrared radiance measurements made in the presence of cirrus, co-located in-situ aircraft measurements of the cirrus microphysics, and ancillary ground-based remote sensing. Specifically we use spectrally resolved radiances covering the range 400–1500 cm−1, in-situ measurements of cirrus particle sizes and habits, backscatter ceilometer observations of cloud vertical structure and microwave inferred temperature and humidity profiles to investigate whether we can obtain consistency between the derived cloud properties and atmospheric state from these independent sources of data. The primary focus of this study is on the sensitivity of the retrieved cloud particle size to the assumed crystal habit. Excellent consistency between the retrieved cloud parameters is achieved both with the ceilometer derived optical depth and the size distribution measured by the aircraft by assuming the crystal habit to be comprised of bullet rosettes. The averaged values of the effective diameter and optical depth obtained from radiometric  measurements are (26.5 ± 1.8) µm and (0.12 ± 0.01) in comparison with the values derived from in-situ and ceilometer measurements equal to (31.5 ± 5.0) µm and (0.13 ± 0.01), respectively.   Furthermore, we show that the radiance information contained within the far-infrared (wavenumbers < 650 cm−1) spectrum is critical to achieving this level of agreement with the in-situ aircraft observations. The results emphasize why it is vital to expand the current limited database of measurements encompassing the far-infrared spectrum, particularly in the presence of cirrus, to explore whether this finding holds over a wider range of conditions."

Mineral dust is known to have an impact on human health, partly due to various metals it contains, with the size of the particles also being an important factor. The goal of this study was to determine the concentration of various metals in the dust, how this relates to dust size, and whether air quality standards were surpassed. 
 The ’A’ą̈y Chù’ Valley in Kluane National Park and Reserve, Yukon, Canada has undergone significant hydrological change in the past decade due to climate-driven glacial recession. This has reverted the ’A’ą̈y Chù’ to a major source of sediment-derived mineral dust, representing an environmental change for the region. Mineral dust influences climatic radiative forcing and impacts human health, both of which depend on its concentration, size distribution, and composition. This work discusses results from a field campaign conducted in the ’A’ą̈y Chù’ Valley in 2021 aimed at understanding and quantifying these parameters, with comparison to a previous campaign in the same location to evaluate the evolution of the dust emissions between 2018 and 2021. An optical particle counter (OPC) instrument measured a mean volume diameter of airborne dust of 4.43 µm at 3.3 m above ground, with Coulter Counter measurements being used for comparison and validation. The concentration of many metal(loid)s in the dust were also studied: Al, Ag, As, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Rb, Tl, U, and V. It was found that 24 h ambient air quality criteria for exposure to several metal(loid)s were surpassed. Significant enrichment of several metal(loid)s was observed for both the PM10 and PM2.5 size fractions relative to the Total Suspended Material (TSP) fraction of the mineral dust and the parent soil. This suggests that the mineral dust in the ’A’ą̈y Chù’ Valley possesses compounding characteristics that are detrimental to human health due to exposure to potentially toxic metal(loid) concentrations."

Due to an improved retrieval setup, the high bias and poor vertical resolution of upper stratospheric ClO, which had affected the previous V5 data set, has been removed. Comparisons with ClO observations of the Microwave Limb Sounder generally show good agreement. Differences can be explained by simulations with an atmospheric chemistry model. 
 Global distributions of chlorine monoxide (ClO) were retrieved from infrared limb emission spectra recorded with the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS), covering the time period from July 2002 to April 2012. The retrieval was performed by constrained non-linear least squares fitting using spectral lines in the fundamental band of ClO around 844 cm−1. The vertical resolution of V8 ClO is 4 km at 18–20 km and 7.5–9.5 km at 40 km altitude. The considerable improvement at 40 km with respect to the previous V5 data version is achieved by extension of the spectral range for retrieval of upper stratospheric ClO. Errors are by far dominated by measurement noise and increase from 0.4–0.5 ppbv at 20 km to 0.8 ppbv at 50 km altitude. Thus, in general, individual ClO profiles are noisy, and profile averaging has to be performed for, e.g., analysis of the upper stratospheric maximum. However, strongly enhanced lower stratospheric ClO amounts of more than 1.5 ppbv during polar winter are well detected in single measurements. Along with the standard representation of the data, an alternative coarse grid representation that obviates the need to apply averaging kernels in certain situations is also provided. Due to improved modeling of the atmospheric continuum and the instrumental offset, the high bias in upper stratospheric ClO that had particularly affected the previous V5 data over the period 2005–2012 has been removed. A comparison with ClO measurements of the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on the Aura satellite shows good agreement between the lower stratospheric enhancements observed by the two instruments in polar winter. There is also good agreement between the upper stratospheric ClO amounts observed in the northern hemisphere and at southern hemispheric low latitudes. With the support of simulations from the Earth system model ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC), deviations between the ClO amounts of MIPAS and MLS in the Antarctic lower stratosphere during July and in the upper stratosphere, especially at southern mid- and high latitudes during winter, are attributed to the different local solar times of the measurements."

By blending satellite images with computer models using artificial intelligence, researchers created continuous, high-resolution daily maps of these gases globally and for China from 2019 to 2023. This data accurately tracks pollution from wildfires and farming, offering a key tool for leaders to monitor air quality and check the impact of environmental policies. 
 Long-term, high-resolution monitoring of carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH4) is essential for understanding their spatiotemporal variability and guiding climate mitigation strategies. However, satellite observations like TROPOMI are often incomplete, and existing fusion methods have limitations in accuracy and continuity. This study proposes a signal-domain fusion approach combining 3D discrete cosine transform (DCT) and singular value decomposition (SVD) to integrate TROPOMI data with GEOS-Chem simulations. A lightweight residual U-Net is employed to refine the initial reconstruction by learning the residual field using meteorological drivers and model outputs, guided by a masked loss. The method produces global 0.25° and China-specific 0.05° daily gap-free XCO and XCH4 datasets from 2019 to 2023. The fused results outperform GEOS-Chem and are comparable or superior to TROPOMI, with R² values of 0.92 for XCO and 0.85 for XCH4. Trend analysis reveals regional patterns such as XCO increases in North America and declines in Eastern China, and widespread CH4 growth. High-resolution data captures enhancements during the 2022 Chongqing wildfires, with average increases of 17.1 ppb in XCO and 24.5 ppb in XCH4, and reveals lower XCH4 increases over rice-growing areas compared to TROPOMI, with overestimation reduced by 17–26 %, and stronger XCO reductions, with satellite underestimations up to 38 %. These results highlight agricultural contributions and policy impacts. This approach effectively reconstructs missing observations and enhances the utility of satellite–model data for atmospheric research and emission assessments.

 Accurate urban flash flood forecasting relies on well-spatialized rainfall data distribution. This study introduces and utilizes the TTI-HydroMet dataset, a publicly available and unique collection for the Tamanduateí River Watershed, in Sao Paulo (Brazil). The dataset includes rainfall measurements from 23 rain gauge stations, stage observations from a hydrological gauge near the outlet, and quantitative precipitation estimates at 1-km radar resolution, accumulated in 10-minute precipitation fields over 10 years. The weather radar data presents missing values for only 0.3 % of timestamps during rainfall events observed by rain gauges. The Spearman correlation coefficient between weather radar and rain gauges varies from 0.675 (full period) to 0.949 (a specific event). It was used to assess the predictive capacity of Machine Learning (ML) hydrological models trained on accumulated rainfall data from rain gauges and estimated by a weather radar. Using an advanced cross-validation framework, two representative algorithms (LinearSVR and XGBRegressor) were tested across different rainfall source configurations and showed strong performance at lead times up to 120 minutes. The Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency index ranges from 0.781 to 0.996. The statistically comparable performance of ML models driven by radar and rain gauge rainfall indicates that radar-based ML approaches can represent a viable alternative for short-term stage forecasting in regions lacking rain gauge networks."

We undertook calculations with an Earth system model using a high-performance computer to explore hydrogen atmospheric dynamics. Simulations with our model yielded highly accurate results at global scale. Correctly representing hydroxyl radicals in the model is a critical requirement for predicting hydrogen concentrations well. Our hydrogen budget is also in very good agreement with bottom-up literature estimates. 
 In this study, we use an earth system model with detailed atmospheric chemistry (EMAC v2.55.2) to undertake simulations of hydrogen (H2) atmospheric dynamics. Extensive global equilibrium simulations were performed with a horizontal resolution of 1.9°. The results of this simulation are compared with observational data from 56 stations in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Global Monitoring Laboratory (GML) Carbon Cycle Cooperative Global Air Sampling Network. We introduced H2 sources and sinks, the latter inclusive of a soil uptake scheme, that accounts for bacterial consumption. The model thus accounts for detailed H2 and methane (CH4) flux boundary conditions. Results from the EMAC model are accurate and predict the magnitude, amplitude and interhemispheric seasonality of the annual H2 cycle at most observational stations. Time series comparison of EMAC and observational data produces Pearson correlation coefficients (r) in excess of 0.9 at eight remote stations located in polar regions and on high mid-latitude islands. A further 23 stations yielded correlation coefficients between 0.7–0.9, predominantly located in remote marine stations across all latitudes and also in polar regions. The quality of model predictions (r<0.5, 9 stations) is reduced in anthropogenically highly polluted stations in east Asia and the Mediterranean region and stations impacted by peat fire emissions in Indonesia, as local and incidental emissions are difficult to capture. Our H2 budget corroborates bottom-up estimates in the literature in terms of source and sink strengths and overall atmospheric burden. By simulating hydroxyl radicals (OH) in the atmosphere leading to a CH4 lifetime in agreement with observationally constrained estimates, we show that the EMAC model is a capable tool for undertaking high accuracy simulation of H2 at global scale. Future research applications could target the impact of potentially significant natural and anthropogenic H2 sources on air quality and climate, reducing uncertainties in the H2 soil sink and impacts of H2 release on the future oxidising capacity of the atmosphere."

The database is designed to support habit-evolving microphysical schemes, which predict continuous changes in ice particle properties rather than the traditionally assumed fixed categories. It includes over 2600 individual crystals and 450 aggregates with varying riming degrees and morphology. 
 The optical properties of atmospheric hydrometeors are a crucial component of any forward operator. These forward operators are essential data assimilation, and atmospheric model evaluations. Recent advances in microphysical modelling, such as Lagrangian super-particle models with habit prediction for ice particles, allow for the continuous evolution of particle properties in contrast to fixed hydrometer classes with fixed properties. This increasing complexity demands scattering databases capable of handling a wide range of particle properties.The discrete dipole approximation (DDA) is one of the most accurate and widely used methods for computing the scattering properties of irregular ice particles. However, its high computational cost typically limits either the diversity of particle shapes or the range of environmental parameters (e.g., frequency, temperature) represented in existing databases, constraining their applicability to models with highly variable microphysics.In this study, we present a new DDA-based database of optical properties at 5.6, 9.6, 35.6, and 94 GHz, specifically designed to accommodate the broad range of ice crystal morphologies predicted by habit-evolving schemes. The database contains 2627 individual ice crystals, including dendrites, plates, and columns, as well as 450 aggregates with varying degrees of riming and crystal types. The data are organized in three levels: Level 0 provides raw scattering matrices at individual orientations for a full range of scattering angles; level 1a summarizes Mueller and Amplitude matrix elements relevant for radar applications (at forward and backward scattering angles); and level 1b offers lookup tables of scattering properties that are relevant for polarimetric radars assuming azimuthally random orientations of the particles. These data allow for flexible treatment of the canting angle of the particles. The lookup tables are directly accessible via the McRadar simulator and can also be interfaced with other forward operators.The new database allows for a more consistent and realistic treatment of evolving ice particle properties in atmospheric models, improving the interpretation of radar observations and model-observation integration."

The solid–liquid distribution coefficient (logKd) is a key parameter for PFAS mobility, but current machine learning (ML) models often overlook its susceptibility to real-world water chemistry. To address this, we introduce the Phys-ML Sorp Framework, a novel multiscale approach integrating molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with ML to enhance logKd prediction. We quantified physically informed microscopic features from MD simulations, including radius of gyration (Rg), solvent accessible surface area (SASA), and a novel effective activity coefficient (logγ) that uniquely captures solute conformational responses by incorporating MD-derived Rg into an extended Debye–Hückel equation, offering a physically meaningful measure of nonideal solution effects. Leveraging 499 PFAS partitioning observations in pure water and calcium chloride (CaCl2) systems, our model achieved superior predictive performance (RPD = 2.90, RMSE = 0.32). The incorporation of MD-derived microscopic features resulted in a 14.62% improvement in RPD and a 13.52% reduction in RMSE over models relying solely on macroscopic parameters. SHAP analysis revealed molecular weight (MW, 0.32), SASA (0.28), logKow (0.23), Rg (0.08), and logγ (0.07) as dominant factors. This framework not only advances environmental pollutant modeling but also establishes a robust, mechanistically informed approach for enhanced environmental risk assessment."

Large-scale models typically simplify BC mixing state representation due to computational constraints, often resulting in substantial overestimations of light absorption. Under the steady-state assumption, we present a physically grounded inversion approach to infer the mixing state of coated BC (CBC) particles by mapping bulk volume and volume fraction of BC cores to the total number concentration and coating thickness distribution parameter (k), based on preset number-size distributions of BC core diameter. By introducing the k-value, we reconstruct the two-dimensional distribution of CBC particles for calculating key optical properties through efficient lookup tables. The inversion approach is validated against both particle-resolved model simulations and field observations, yielding mean relative errors of below 5% for optical properties. Compared to traditional assumptions of uniform composition, our approach accounts for coating thickness heterogeneity among CBC particles, improving optical evaluation in models with a negligible additional computational cost. This work provides a practical and scalable solution to represent the BC mixing state in atmospheric models, facilitating more reliable assessments of BC radiative effects in air quality and climate studies."

While ozone exposure has been linked to anxiety and depression, reliance on ambient measurements may misrepresent personal exposure. This study examined associations between ozone exposure at ambient, indoor, and personal levels and anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and sleep disturbance among young adults, and assessed sleep quality as a potential mediator. A nationwide cross-sectional survey (2023–2024) was conducted across 261 Chinese municipalities. Annual maximum 8-h ozone concentrations over the preceding year were estimated at outdoor, indoor, and personal exposure levels. Validated scales were used to assess anxiety symptoms (GAD-7), depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), and sleep quality (PSQI). Multivariable logistic regression and mediation analysis within a logistic framework were applied, adjusting for sociodemographic, behavioral, and health condition covariates. Among 13,028 participants, the prevalence of anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and sleep disturbance was 14%, 19%, and 39%, respectively. Associations with anxiety and depressive symptoms varied modestly across outdoor, indoor, and personal ozone exposure. Per interquartile range increase in outdoor, indoor, and personal ozone concentrations, odds ratios for anxiety were 1.17, 1.19, and 1.14; corresponding estimates for depression were 1.14, 1.13, and 1.10. Sleep quality mediated 10–30% and 16–49% of the ozone-anxiety and ozone-depression associations, respectively. These findings suggest that incorporating indoor and personal exposure metrics may provide additional insight into ozone-related mental health risks, with sleep quality serving as a mediator."

This study aimed to quantify errors in ambient data proxies and develop a scalable modeling framework for personal exposure prediction using readily available data. We conducted a panel study with 12 adults from three diverse Chinese cities, collecting 4571 person-hours of personal PM2.5 measurements. These were compared against three ambient data sources to quantify relative errors. We developed a modeling framework integrating ambient concentrations, meteorological variables, and basic personal characteristics, incorporating systematic preprocessing, feature engineering, variable selection, and multialgorithm comparison optimized through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation. Results showed substantial personal-ambient exposure discrepancies, with relative errors of 39–48% for the daily average level. The framework successfully predicted personal exposure, with a Random Forest model using daily monitoring-station data achieving the highest performance (R2 = 0.87). SHAP analysis identified ambient PM2.5 as the dominant predictor, with personal traits and meteorology also contributing significantly. This work provides a validated, end-to-end modeling framework that moves beyond ambient proxies, offering a standardized workflow to refine personal exposure estimates in large cohorts and enhance the validity of air pollution health studies."

 Changes in the translation speed of landfalling tropical cyclones (TCs) pose great challenges in disaster preparedness. While some recent studies have discussed the increased chance of a reduction in the annual-mean translation speed of TCs after landfall, such changes before landfall have not been systematically investigated, especially for short-term variations (that is, hour-to-day timescales). Here we show, first based on observations, that globally, a TC about to make landfall tends to accelerate towards the coast, with an average acceleration of about 0.83 m s−1 per day, which means that the mean translation speed of a landfalling TC increases by ~48% during the 60-h period before landfall. Such an acceleration exists irrespective of TC intensity, seasonality and ocean basin, although its magnitude varies. Numerical simulations demonstrate that land–sea differences in surface roughness and thermal effect result in asymmetric circulation and convection in TCs, both of which are enhanced as the TC moves closer to the coast, leading to local changes in potential vorticity and thereby accelerating the storm. As this phenomenon is due to the land–sea contrast, a TC approaching the coast will probably have such an acceleration and hence it is inherent. Landfalling tropical cyclones generally accelerate as they approach coastlines due to changes in surface roughness and thermal properties, according to numerical modelling simulations and global observations."

 The uneven detection of prebiotic organic compounds in meteorites—where amino acids and nucleobases are commonly identified but sugars remain rare and poorly characterized—limits our understanding of extraterrestrial organic chemistry. This discrepancy is striking given that laboratory simulations of interstellar ice chemistry readily produce complex sugars. Here we report the simultaneous analysis of sugar and amino acid enantiomers in a meteorite sample. Multiple aldoses were detected in the Orgueil meteorite, including ribose, arabinose, xylose, lyxose, and the ketopentose ribulose, several of which display near-racemic distributions consistent with an extraterrestrial origin. Recovery experiments demonstrate that sugar abundances are severely underestimated. Despite this limitation, pentose abundances are comparable to those of some C4–C5 amino acid enantiomers, implying higher true concentrations. These results indicate efficient abiotic sugar formation in space and suggest that meteorites may have delivered a broader range of prebiotically relevant sugars to early Earth than previously recognized.

 Due to its potentially life—threatening and devastating economic impacts, variability in the East Asian Summer Monsoon needs better understanding, more accurate simulation and improved prediction. Much of the current ability of long-range summer monsoon forecasts stems from the link to the preceding winter El Niño Southern Oscillation, but the mechanisms behind this lagged impact are not fully understood. In this study, a simple new mechanism is proposed, based on migrating Atmospheric Angular Momentum anomalies. The polewards migration of atmospheric angular momentum associated with winter El Niño is shown to impact the northwest Pacific anticyclone responsible for much of the year-to-year variability in the monsoon. Model forecasts of the summer monsoon are shown to have increased accuracy when this new mechanism is active, with the increase in the success rate of forecasts due to migrating angular momentum anomalies shown to be as large as the effect of El Niño itself."

 Marginal seas with pronounced stratification are susceptible to low dissolved oxygen concentrations, which can lead to hypoxia or anoxia below the pycnocline. In the Baltic Sea, the Major Baltic Inflows ventilate the deep basins while further strengthening stratification. It was suggested that the largest-ever measured Major Baltic Inflow, which occurred in 1951, triggered the deoxygenation of the central Baltic Sea because it significantly strengthened stratification. With the help of a coupled hydrodynamical-ecosystem numerical model, we conducted a couple of numerical experiments and statistically analyzed the hypoxic volume and stratification strength variability on multidecadal timescales. We demonstrate that, although it had some short-term influence, the Major Baltic Inflow in 1951 did not significantly impact the stratification or hypoxia in the Baltic Sea on longer timescales. We provide quantitative estimates of the Major Baltic Inflows’ influence on multidecadal variability of stratification and hypoxia in the central Baltic Sea basins.

 Slope lineae are enigmatic, bright, and seemingly young features on Mercury. Past investigations hypothesized that lineae occurrence might be tied to volatile loss, analogous to hollows, but no systematic analysis has been conducted. Here, we use a deep learning-driven approach to map 402 slope lineae across the planet. Lineae seem to feature blue spectral slopes and tend to originate from hollows or bright, ‘hollow-like’ features located on the equator-facing walls of young impact craters that penetrated volcanic smooth plains, implying that lineae activity could be driven by heat loss, insolation, and the devolatilization of subsurface phases like sulfur. We do not observe any geomorphic lineae activity between 2011 and 2015, suggesting that activity occurs on timescales longer than ~4 years or below MESSENGER’s spatial resolution. Lineae activity as a geomorphic indicator of recent or ongoing volatile loss on Mercury represents a specific hypothesis that can be scrutinized by ESA/JAXA BepiColombo.

 Sudden detachments of entire glacier tongues are rare but potentially devastating events that remain poorly understood. Here, we report on an event that occurred in Tibet on November 1, 2022, with an ice volume of ~40 million cubic meters, ranking it among the largest recorded ice avalanches. Utilizing a broad array of satellite data and seismic signals, we reconstruct the motion of the source glacier leading to its failure and the large landscape changes caused by the avalanche. The lack of glacier advance during its acceleration phase suggests that a frozen terminus has played a key role in the evolution of the glacier failure by acting as a dam to the ice mass pushing from above and its potential water content. The dense coverage by satellite data reveals details of an exponential increase in glacier speeds, up to 46 m per day in the weeks and days prior to failure.
