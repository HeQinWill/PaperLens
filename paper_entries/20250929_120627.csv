 The intensification of extreme rainfall has exacerbated widespread landslide hazards, particularly in tropic and subtropic regions. Hong Kong—the world's most densely populated city situated on steep, forested terrain—faces chronic landslide risks that are challenging to monitor with conventional Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR), as hillslope failures are typically small and hidden beneath dense canopy. This study develops a novel detection framework integrating: 1) HARMIE (Homogeneous Amplitude-phase RefineMent for local Inconsistent phase Estimation), which enhances localized phase variability for subtle displacement retention; and 2) a phase gradient-based detection approach, linking slope responses with extreme rainfall. Simulated and real-data experiments demonstrate that HARMIE outperforms conventional methods by better preserving localized phase detail and magnitude. Using high-resolution ascending and descending Lutan-1 (LT-1) SAR datasets (July 2023–October 2024) over Lantau Island, Hong Kong, the framework mapped widespread hillslope failures triggered by the October 2023 extreme rainfalls, achieving a 27 % higher recognition rate than amplitude-homogeneity-based detection, with notable improvements in capturing subtle failures as narrow as ∼10 m. Ten active landslides concealed beneath forests were also pinpointed. Beyond detection, our analysis reveals that prolonged antecedent rainfall drives seasonal progressive creep on minor slopes and, for certain slopes, may interact with extreme rainfall to accelerate destabilization. This study represents the first InSAR-based mapping of small, forest-covered landslides in Hong Kong using L-band SAR, offering new insights into hillslope destabilization in forested mountainous terrain and advancing the development of landslide early-warning systems in such regions."

 Satellite-derived soil moisture (SM) products frequently encounter extensive data gaps that significantly limit their practical utility, necessitating the development of robust gap-filling techniques to generate SM datasets with enhanced accuracy and continuous spatiotemporal coverage. Existing studies have typically relied on single machine learning or interpolation methods to fill SM gaps at regional scales. Machine learning approaches excel at filling missing values in large regions but tend to smooth out important local SM features, while the interpolation methods perform well in areas with low levels of missing data, but exhibit significant uncertainty in regions with large amounts of continuously missing data. These two kinds of approaches show potential complementarity and could together contribute to a more robust gap-filling method, which however have rarely been investigated. To fill this research gap, we established a novel SM gap-filling method by synergizing the advantages of machine learning for large-scale gap filling and the excellent gap-filling performance of interpolation in localized areas using the Stacking method at a global scale. The proposed approach integrates four base models including three machine learning techniques namely Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), and Feed-forward Neural Network (FNN), and one interpolation method known as Natural Neighbor Interpolation (NNI), and employs the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) as the meta model. We compared the Stacking method and individual approaches in filling ESA CCI missing SM data, and validated the gap-filled SM using extensive ground SM from 1086 sites worldwide. The results indicate: (1) RF performs the best among the six selected machine learning methods, and its overall accuracy at a global scale is higher than that of interpolation methods. The feature importance analysis by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) indicates ERA5 SM, NDVI, and Global Aridity Index have high importance in the RF gap-filling model; (2) NNI is the best performing approach among the four selected interpolation methods, and it demonstrates better performance than machine learning methods in localized areas where the original SM data is relatively abundant; (3) Stacking is an effective method for SM gap filling on a global scale, with an averaged ubRMSE of 0.017 m3/m3, RMSE of 0.022 m3/m3, Bias of 0.006 m3/m3, and R of 0.87 against the original ESA CCI SM, and it reduces the RMSE by 0.009 m3/m3, ubRMSE by 0.006 m3/m3, and improves R by 0.15 relative to the individual best-performing RF method; (4) The gap-filled SM shows an improved skill than the original ESA CCI SM against global distributed ground SM, with Stacking displaying the lowest ubRMSE of 0.057 m3/m3 and the highest R of 0.63. The proposed Stacking method opens new avenues to fill the gaps in various satellite SM datasets."

 High spatial-resolution Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) images often show image features due to surface waves, swells, fronts, internal waves, eddies, and currents under different sunglint and skyglint reflections. Here, MSI images are used to estimate wave direction and wavelength through a simple but practical method using Angular spectrum analysis (ASA). The method does not require the complex transfer function between the image domain and the physical domain, but is based on the MSI-derived Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) spectrum that reveals the wave direction, whose 180o ambiguity is then removed by the inter-band time lag between the B04 and B08 bands (0.74 s). The wavelength of different sea waves (wind wave and swell) can also be estimated by quantifying the MSI FFT images. There is a statistically significant linear relationship between MSI-derived and buoy-measured wave direction and wavelength (N = 144) with low bias. Further analyses according to wave age criterion show a better statistical relationship for wind waves (N = 62) than swells (N = 82). Comparison with the hourly wind products of the fifth generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5) shows RMS differences of <1.4 m/s and 14.4o for wind speed and direction, respectively. These results demonstrate that, under certain observing conditions, high spatial-resolution optical remote sensing images can provide relatively accurate estimates of surface wave directions and wavelengths as well as wind speeds, while operational applications still require further work."

Beier,"From pixels to parcels: Flexible, practical small-area uncertainty estimation for spatial averages obtained from aboveground biomass maps","•Uncertainty estimated for aboveground biomass estimates in small-area parcels. •Estimates use variability from samples, residuals, and auxiliary and reference data. •Residual variance is largest contributor to total uncertainty in small-area parcels. •Spatial autocorrelation of model residuals drives residual variance in small areas. •Regression model accurately estimates standard error from parcel characteristics. 
 Fine-resolution maps of forest carbon and aboveground biomass (AGB) effectively represent spatial patterns and can be flexibly aggregated to map subregions by computing spatial averages or totals of pixel-level predictions. However, generalized model-based uncertainty estimation for spatial aggregates requires computationally expensive processes like iterative bootstrapping and computing pixel covariances. Uncertainty estimation for map subregions is critical for enhancing practicality and eventual adoption of model-based data products, as this capability would empower users to produce estimates at scales most germane to management of the landscape: individual forest stands and ownership parcels. In this study we produced estimates of standard error (SE) associated with spatial averages of fine-resolution AGB map predictions for a stratified random sample of ownership parcels (0–2023 hectares) in New York State (NYS). This represents the first model-based uncertainty estimation study to include all four types of uncertainty (reference data, sample variability, residual variability, and auxiliary data), incorporate spatial autocorrelation of model residuals, and use methods compatible with algorithmic modeling (machine learning or nonparametric). We found that uncertainty attributed to residual variance, largely resulting from spatial correlation of residuals, dominated all other sources for all of the parcels in the study. These results suggest that improvements to model accuracy will yield the greatest reductions to total uncertainty in regions like the northeastern and midwestern United States where forests are divided into smaller spatial units. Further, we demonstrated that log–log regression relating parcel characteristics (area, perimeter, AGB density, forest cover) to parcel-level SE can accurately estimate uncertainty for map subregions, thus providing a convenient means to empower map users. These findings support transparency in future model-based forest carbon accounting and monitoring efforts."

 As global urbanization accelerates and ecological challenges intensify, effective monitoring and assessing ecological conditions have become critical for sustainable development. Remote sensing technologies play an increasingly crucial role in this context. The Sustainable Development Goals Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1), a next-generation remote sensing satellite, provides 10-m spatial resolution and multispectral imaging capabilities, offering new opportunities for ecological monitoring. This study explores the ecological potential of SDGSAT-1 data, focusing on the comprehensive assessment of urban heat islands (UHI), urban vegetation coverage, and regional ecological conditions. This is achieved through a detailed comparison with the widely-used Landsat-8/9 data. The study develops several methodologies for cloud detection, atmospheric correction, and land dryness retrieval. Validation shows that the cloud removal effect achieved by the proposed SDGSAT Cloud Mask (SCM) algorithm is comparable to, or slightly better than, those of the CFMask algorithm for Landsat-9 and the machine learning-based S2cloudless algorithm for Sentinel-2A, with F1 scores greater than 0.92. The results show that the monitoring of regional ecological conditions by SDGSAT-1 is very similar to that of Landsat-8/9, with differences generally under 5 %. Because SDGSAT-1's multispectral and thermal infrared imagery has higher spatial resolution than Landsat-8/9, it can detect 5.6 % more vegetation area and 2.6 times larger high-temperature areas within urban environments than Landsat data. SDGSAT-1's finer resolution enables more detailed ecological assessments, supporting urban sustainability applications. However, due to the lack of shortwave infrared bands in the SDGSAT-1 imagery, it is less effective than Landsat-8/9 in interpreting land surface dryness and moisture content."

 Emperor penguins serve as early-warning sentinels for the Antarctic ecosystem and climate change. Understanding how climate change influences their habitat use offers insights into the fragile polar ecosystem for supporting the climate actions under the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, it remains unclear how the gradual climate change and extreme climatic events affect the dispersal of emperor penguin breeding habitats due to the lack of a systematic and long-term dataset documenting their habitat use. Here, we first develop guano indices and present an automated approach to map emperor penguin breeding habitats at 30-m spatial resolution using Earth observation satellite imagery, achieving a user accuracy of 94.8 %. We further reveal that habitat dispersal is sensitive to four extreme events—heat, blizzard, storm, and low sea ice. Specifically, colonies exposed to intense climate extremes generally exhibit more fragmented distributions, with habitat reuse periods mostly under 3 years and interannual habitat dispersal exceeding 4 km. These four extreme events together explained 21 %–72 % of the variability in annual habitat dispersal. Under a high-emission scenario driven by fossil fuels, the warming-induced annual fragmentation of habitats is projected to be 255 m greater than that under a low-emission scenario using clean energy, leading to higher vulnerability in emperor penguins by disrupting their ability to survive and reproduce. The proposed method enables routine mapping and updating of emperor penguin breeding habitats, and the associated findings demonstrate that extreme climatic events significantly impact habitat use and dispersal patterns, highlighting the urgent need for global climate policies aligned with sustainable development to protect the Antarctic ecosystem."

 This study presents a new satellite ocean color data record of Secchi depth (ZSD) observations from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). As part of the NOAA enterprise satellite data processing, the decade-long ZSD data are derived from the visible and near-infrared reflectance measurements over oceanic, coastal, and inland waters. Based on in situ data, the model is excellent in generating low-uncertainty ZSD data with an absolute percentage difference (APD) of 15%–29%. The satellite and in situ matchups confirm reliable satellite retrievals with APD = 19%–26% over the ZSD range of 0.1–60 m. Although the product uncertainties are dependent on optical water types, assessments show that the satellite ZSD estimations are very reliable, especially where ZSD ≥ 1 m. This new satellite product has enabled the ability to access Level-2 daily ZSD imagery and information as well as Level-3 data aggregated on daily to monthly scales. Our examination indicates that the ocean transparent windows are situated at 443 and 486 nm in the vast open oceans and 551 nm for most coastal waters. They shift to the red band at 671 nm for extremely turbid environments, such as large river estuaries. From a global perspective, the ZSD data extend from less than half a meter in nearshore environments to >70 m in the South Pacific Gyre, while demonstrating a strong dependency on the optical water types. Short-term fluctuations over time are registered in the satellite ZSD daily and monthly data from almost every aquatic environment. Trend analyses reveal significant increases in water transparency over many regions, especially the open ocean. We stress the necessity of normalizing satellite ZSD estimations to eliminate the uncertainties induced by different solar-zenith angles. The present satellite products can be further improved by accounting for the limitations imposed by the multispectral reflectance data with hyperspectral ocean color spectra."

Here we propose a novel framework combining the Box-Cox transformation that addresses the skewed distribution of samples and more critical predictors as well as remote sensing indices, to predict global soil salinity (electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract, ECe) and sodicity (exchangeable sodium percentage, ESP) from 1980 to 2024 with a 1 km × 1 km resolution using random forest. Model accuracy is higher than previous studies, with root mean square error (RMSE) of ECe and ESP as 2.24 and 6.04 respectively, and an R2 of 0.65, and 0.60 respectively. The implementation of the Box-Cox transformation significantly improved the model performance (R2) by approximately 100 % (from 0.35 to 0.79 for ECe and 0.59 to 0.85 for ESP), while the additional predictors further enhanced the performance (R2 increased by 15 %), ranking in the top 30 % of the feature importance list. Results revealed that global multiple-year average salinization and sodification are primarily concentrated in arid regions characterized by low precipitation and high temperatures. We also found a significant increasing trend of soil salinization in 20 % of global land and of sodification in 48 % of global land from 1980 to 2024, both most pronounced near the equator, as well as in central and eastern North America, Europe, southeastern China, and Mongolia. This study provides updated long-term soil salinity and sodicity maps with improved accuracies, offering critical insights for sustainable land management under climate change, serving as an essential resource for addressing food security and land degradation challenges worldwide."

 Radiative transfer models (RTMs) describe how light is absorbed, scattered, and transmitted within leaves by simulating mechanistic light propagation processes. The PROSPECT model is based on measurable parameters (the leaf biochemical content) and a non-measurable parameter (the leaf anatomical structure represented by the leaf structure parameter (N)). The effect of N on the optical properties of leaves has been investigated through a number of local and global sensitivity analyses. Other studies have directly evaluated the effect of the leaf anatomical structure on spectral reflectance, particularly in the near infrared region. However, the relationship between N and the anatomical structure is unclear. In this study, we leveraged eLeaf, a ray tracing-based 3D rice leaf simulator, to establish relationships between leaf anatomical features and spectral properties, enabling us to replace N in the PROSPECT-4 model with measurable leaf anatomical parameters and develop the RSPECT model. The leaf thickness at minor vein, leaf thickness at bulliform cells, mesophyll thickness at minor vein, and distance between two minor veins could be used to predict N effectively. The RSPECT model achieved spectral simulation accuracy comparable to PROSPECT-4 and was more suitable for parameter inversion of the physical and chemical properties of rice leaves, with relative root mean square errors of 7.4 % for chlorophyll content, 5.6 % for equivalent water thickness, and 7.5 % for dry matter content. In conclusion, RSPECT improves radiative transfer modeling by integrating measurable anatomical features and provides a framework for extending this approach to other vegetation types."

 High-resolution mapping of forest attributes is crucial for ecosystem monitoring and carbon budget assessments. Recent advancements have leveraged satellite imagery and deep learning algorithms to generate high-resolution forest height maps. While these maps provide valuable snapshots of forest conditions, they lack the temporal resolution to estimate forest-related carbon fluxes or track annual changes. Few studies have produced annual forest height, volume, or biomass change maps validated at the forest stand level. To address this limitation, we developed a deep learning framework, coupling data from Sentinel-1 (S1), Sentinel-2 (S2) and from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission, to generate a time series of forest height, growing stock volume, and aboveground biomass at 10 to 30-m spatial resolution that we refer to as FORMS-T (FORest Multiple Satellite Time series). Unlike previous studies, we train our model on individual S2 scenes, rather than on growing season composites, to account for acquisition variability and improve generalization across years. We produced these maps for France over seven years (2018–2024) for height at 10 m resolution and further converted them to 30 m maps of growing stock volume and aboveground biomass using leaf type-specific allometric equations. Evaluation against the French National Forest Inventory (NFI) showed an average mean absolute error of 3.07 m for height (r2 = 0.68) across all years, 86 m3 ha-1 for volume and 65.1 Mg ha-1 for biomass. We further evaluated FORMS-T capacity to capture growth on a site where two successive airborne laser scanning (ALS) campaigns were available, showing a good agreement with ALS data when aggregating at coarser spatial resolution (r2 = 0.60, MAE = 0.27 m for the 2020–2022 growth of trees between 10 and 15 m in 5 km pixels). Additionally, we compared our results to the NFI-based wood volume production at regional level and obtained a good agreement with a MAE of 1.45 m3 ha-1 yr-1 and r2 of 0.59. We then leveraged our height change maps to derive species-specific growth curves and compared them to ground-based measurements, highlighting distinct growth dynamics and regional variations in forest management practices. Further development of such maps could contribute to the assessment of forest-related carbon stocks and fluxes, contributing to the formulation of a comprehensive carbon budget at the country scale, and supporting global efforts to mitigate climate change."

 The PlanetScope CubeSat constellation provides unprecedentedly high spatiotemporal resolution for Earth observations but is limited by radiometric inconsistencies resulting from sensor degradation and spectral configuration differences. Existing harmonization methods often rely on internal or external references, limiting harmonization to only a subset of spectral bands or restricting applicability to localized spatiotemporal scales. To address these limitations, we propose Harmoni-Planet, a novel harmonization method that leverages graph-based greedy optimization to achieve holistic radiometric consistency across all PlanetScope bands without requiring reference data. The method consists of two components: (1) graph construction, which integrates unharmonized images into a graph with nodes representing images and edges connecting intersecting images, and (2) graph optimization, which iteratively minimizes radiometric inconsistencies between each image and its intersecting images to optimize consistency. Harmoni-Planet was validated across four geographically diverse regions (the Nile, Beijing, Indonesia, and Greenland), achieving substantial mean absolute error (MAE) reductions of 53 %, 53 %, 57 %, and 25 %, respectively, and outperforming the CubeSat-enabled spatiotemporal enhancement method (CESTEM; 40 %, 41 %, 47 %, and − 69 %, respectively) and the official harmonization algorithm (25 %, 33 %, −9 %, and 9 %, respectively). Harmoni-Planet significantly improves the spatial and temporal comparability of imagery across all PlanetScope bands, regardless of whether images are acquired by the same or different generations of satellites. In addition, it supports flexible scene-based and strip-based implementations, effectively resolving both intra-strip and cross-strip inconsistencies. It also demonstrates robust potential for near-real-time harmonization of newly acquired imagery to accommodate the rapidly expanding data volume of the PlanetScope constellation. Furthermore, Harmoni-Planet supports seamless integration with standard third-party reflectance products such as Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2. Harmoni-Planet provides a practical solution to address cross-sensor radiometric inconsistencies, substantially improving the quality and reliability of PlanetScope data for diverse Earth observation applications."

 The urban land-use map reflects the distribution of the different functional lands in the city, serving as a valuable reference for urban planning and management. High-resolution remote sensing (HRS) images provide detailed spatial information about parcels but lack socio-economic information, which is crucial for identifying land-use types. To enhance the mapping performance and obtain more comprehensive land-use information, the integration of HRS images and points of interest (POIs) with socio-economic information is crucial. Nonetheless, the existing land-use mapping methods based on HRS images and POIs are generally confronted with the following challenges: 1) due to the reliance on prior knowledge, the existing methods cannot automatically capture the complex relationships between multi-source data and land-use categories; 2) there are substantial semantic disparities between HRS images and POIs, so that the simple fusion approaches cannot fully utilize the complementary information; and 3) the existing methods are generally based on the assumption of complete modalities, resulting in them failing to work on POI-deficient parcels. In this paper, to address these issues, an end-to-end urban land-use mapping framework integrating HRS images and multi-source geographic data (Multi-E2E) is proposed. The Multi-E2E framework automatically establishes the mapping from multi-source data to land-use categories through a data-driven approach, and generates informative fused representations with an adaptive fusion module (AFM). In Multi-E2E, the labeled HRS image-POI pairs are constructed using the areas of interest (AOIs), and the interactions between modalities are facilitated by the end-to-end architecture. To identify POI-deficient parcels and ensure that the modality-specific encoders are adequately supervised, a unimodal supervision module (USM) is introduced in the Multi-E2E framework. Experiments conducted with multi-source samples from 34 Chinese cities and the urban regions of Beijing, Wuhan, Hong Kong, Macao, and Helsinki validate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed framework for urban land-use mapping applications.

 Local climate zone (LCZ) provides a detailed classification system for building types in urban areas and offers a unified standard for block-scale surface urban heat island (SUHI) studies. However, LCZ mapping methods with high classification accuracy for global applicability, and multi-city comparison of SUHI based on LCZ are still needed. In this study, we developed a transferable LCZ mapping framework for 30 China cities at 120 m by using multi-source remote sensing and GIS data, and random forest model. The gap-filled LST for 21 cities among 30 cities with diverse urbanized levels and climate conditions were generated, utilizing Landsat 8 data, LST retrieval algorithm and gap-filling method. Spatial patterns of SUHI intensity across climate zones and cities of different sizes were explored, and the impacts of urban morphology on SUHI in built-up LCZs were analyzed using the boosted regression trees model. Results showed that the proposed LCZ mapping framework achieved high accuracy in China cities, with overall accuracy from 0.86 to 0.93. Its robustness and transferability were further demonstrated in three cities in the United States with overall accuracy of 0.91 to 0.93. LST gap-filling method also performed well, with R from 0.71 to 0.91 and RMSE from 1.86 °C to 3.59 °C, respectively. Our multi-city assessment revealed consistent patterns of SUHI in LCZs across climate zones: compact mid-rise (LCZ 2) and large low-rise (LCZ 8) had the highest SUHI intensity, while sparsely built (LCZ 9) and open low-rise (LCZ 6) had the lowest values. Moreover, LCZ 2 tended to have higher SUHI intensity in colder climate regions, while LCZ 8 exhibited higher values in warmer climate regions. City size also influenced SUHI effect in built-up LCZs, with large cities exhibiting SUHI intensity up to 1 °C higher than small cities. Additionally, vegetation exhibited the largest of relative importance (20 % to 68 %) which impacted SUHI intensity in built-up LCZs, with a higher value in cold cities compared to warm cities. Impervious or building surface fraction also accounted for 13 % to 45 % of the SUHI contribution across LCZs, with relative importance about 3 % to 10 % greater in warmer and larger cities. The findings of this study can be useful in developing urban planning policies for intra-city SUHI mitigation, and our transferable LCZ mapping framework can be applied to other global cities for SUHI studies."

 Changes in forest structure (FS) significantly influence forest conditions and dynamics, ecosystem services, including biomass accumulation and biodiversity. Several LiDAR metrics have been described to analyse FS at a high spatial resolution, including vertical and horizontal attributes. This study aimed to investigate FS development in spruce (Picea abies), oak (Quercus robur) and beech (Fagus sylvatica) through the first 50 years after planting and their relationship to biomass stocks and richness of arrival tree species. LiDAR and ground truth data were extracted from 60 plots. To characterize the FS, LiDAR metrics were calculated using a point cloud of 5.4 pulses/m2 under leaf-off conditions from 2019. Moreover, trees were measured in 2022 following the Danish National Forest Inventory protocols to calculate biomass and estimate tree species richness. FS changes and their relationship were analyzed by employing linear mixed models and principal component analysis (PCA). Results show that spruce stands exhibited rapid growth in height and the highest canopy cover values over time. Contrarily, oak stands developed a multi-layer canopy, increasing light availability and tree size variability with age. At later stages, beech stands reached similar height as spruce and showed the highest standard deviation of height (StDH) with age. The PCA revealed that tree maximum height and StDH were primarily age-dependent, while the internal vertical and horizontal variability tree species dependent. Spruce showed a constant homogeneous FS, oak was characterized by a high internal and external FS heterogeneity, while beech gradually decreased the FS variability over time. Old, tall and structurally homogeneous beech and spruce stands supported the highest biomass accumulation. Conversely, more structurally heterogeneous oak stands tended to harbor greater tree species richness. The study underscores the importance of incorporating both vertical and horizontal dimensions to understand FS changes and the trade-offs between biomass production and biodiversity in monoculture afforestation."

 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data acquisition is increasingly challenged by the overcrowded radio frequency bands, leading to the problem of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI), particularly at L-band. Knowledges about global RFI are important for the protection of the microwave bands allocated for active remote sensing, SAR system design and operation, as well as the systematic mitigation of RFI for SAR data end users. It is becoming more important as we are entering the unprecedented golden age of L-band SAR satellites. In this work, we develop algorithms, workflow and system for operationally measuring global RFI experienced by L-band SAR data. We define a data format for recording the RFI measurements, which facilitates the computation of a number of RFI metrics. We process all available L-band SAR data acquired by the JAXA ALOS-1 (2006–2011) and JERS-1 (1992–1998) satellites. For comparison with RFI in C-band data, we also process part of the ESA Envisat (2002−2012) data archive acquired in the same time frame (2005–2007). The final results provide a global view of RFI at L-band, showing its spatial and temporal variations. We find heavy RFI pollutions in East Asia, North America, and the region consisting of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. Comparison of results from ALOS-1 and JERS-1 indicates the increasing trend of RFI pollution. Comparison with C-band Envisat result shows that RFI at L-band is significantly more severe than at C-band. Comparison of results from different polarizations shows that cross polarization data are more susceptible to RFI due to their lower radar backscatter. The global RFI distribution from L-band SAR data is found similar to that from L-band passive radiometers including SMOS and SMAP."

 The accurate retrieval of land surface phenology (LSP) for drylands is extremely challenging. Drylands exhibit vegetation characteristics such as sparse and patchy vegetation cover, low seasonal greenness variability, and high spatial heterogeneity. The irregular rainy and dry episodes often complicate vegetation growth, leading to an irregular temporal trajectory with multiple growth stages during the greenup and senescence phases. Moreover, the heterogeneous phenological cycles among the vegetation species in a satellite pixel and other factors may lead to a long period with only a very slight increase or decrease in greenness before or after a vegetation growing cycle. Current phenological retrieval methods, however, commonly assume that vegetation greenness gradually increases in a greenup phase and decreases in a senescence phase, following a single sigmoidal growth trajectory, which is inadequate to describe the irregular growth in drylands. In this study, we developed a novel algorithm to improve on the hybrid piecewise logistic model (HPLM) for improving LSP retrievals, especially in drylands. Our enhanced HPLM (E-HPLM) algorithm addresses two characteristics of irregular growth trajectories: (1) the multiple plateau stages within a greenup or senescence phase, and (2) the long linear tail before the start or after the end of a growing season. Specifically, we identified multiple growth stages within a greenup or senescence phase in order to fit each stage separately with a logistic model, and added a linear parameter to the logistic model to eliminate long linear tails by adjusting the background values. We implemented this new algorithm to retrieve LSPs in global drylands using the 500 m Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) dataset from 2013 to 2022. The results were then compared with those of HPLM-retrieved LSPs. We also evaluated the E-HPLM results using phenometrics derived from the PhenoCam observations at site levels and the fused Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS)-PhenoCam dataset at regional levels. The E-HPLM was able to reduce the uncertainty by ∼10 days in the pixels with plateau stages from 2013 to 2022 in global drylands in comparison with the HPLM algorithm, where the plateau stage appeared in over 74 % of drylands. Compared with the HPLM, the E-HPLM improved overall phenology accuracy by two days for the PhenoCam sites and one to four days in HLS-PhenoCam areas, although the improvements varied with land cover types and aridity levels. The E-HPLM algorithm has the potential to replace the current HPLM algorithm, with improved ability to retrieve LSP in drylands and to generate global LSP products."

 Regressions are commonly used in environmental science and economics to identify causal or associative relationships between variables. In these settings, remote sensing-derived map products increasingly serve as sources of variables, enabling estimation of effects such as the impact of conservation zones on deforestation. However, the quality of map products varies, and — because maps are outputs of complex machine learning algorithms that take in a variety of remotely sensed variables as inputs — errors are difficult to characterize. Thus, population-level estimators from such maps may be biased. In this paper, we apply prediction-powered inference (PPI) to estimate regression coefficients relating a response variable and covariates to each other. PPI is a method that estimates parameters of interest by using a small amount of randomly sampled ground truth data to correct for bias in large-scale remote sensing map products. Applying PPI across multiple remote sensing use cases in regression coefficient estimation, we find that it results in estimates that are (1) more reliable than using the map product as if it were 100% accurate and (2) have lower uncertainty than using only the ground truth sample data and ignoring the map product. Empirically, we observe effective sample size increases of up to 17-fold using PPI compared to only using ground truth data. This is the first work to estimate remote sensing regression coefficients without assumptions on the structure of map product errors.

 Accurate urban land-use mapping is an essential undertaking for various urban issues, such as urban planning, disease transmission, and climate change. Recently, learning-based method has emerged as a prevalent approach for urban land-use mapping, although it relies heavily on abundant labeled data. However, since land-use categories are jointly determined by physical and social attributes, obtaining such labels is challenging. This scarcity of labeled data often leads existing learning-based methods to overfit, resulting in models that struggle to recognize diverse land-use categories. To bypass these limitations, this paper for the first time advocates knowledge graph to leverage indirect supervision from related tasks for zero-shot land-use mapping. Toward this goal, this paper introduces a multi-granularity knowledge graph reasoning (mKGR) framework.R Only with indirect supervision from other tasks, mKGR can automatically integrate multimodal geospatial data as varying granularity entities and rich spatial–semantic interaction relationships. Subsequently, mKGR incorporates a fault-tolerant knowledge graph embedding method to establish relationships between geographic units and land-use categories, thereby reasoning land-use mapping outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that mKGR not only outperforms existing zero-shot approaches, but also exceeds those with direct supervision, achieving improvements of 0.16, 0.08, and 0.20 on PA, UA, and OA. Furthermore, this paper reveals the superiority of mKGR in large-scale holistic reasoning, an essential aspect of land-use mapping. Benefiting from mKGR’s zero-shot classification and large-scale holistic reasoning capabilities, a comprehensive urban land-use map of China is generated with low-cost. In addition, a nationwide assessment of 15-minute city walkability over the land-use map provides insights for urban planning and sustainable development.

 Quantitative information on fracture distributions across Antarctic ice shelves is crucial for improving the predictability of ice shelf calving and retreat. Satellite imagery acquired by various optical and radar sensors provides a valuable resource for studying fracture processes at different spatial and temporal scales. Retrieving high-resolution fracture information at extended spatial and frequent temporal scales is particularly important for understanding the complex dynamics of ice shelves and improving the predictive modeling of their evolution. To efficiently retrieve spatiotemporal fracture information, we developed a novel multitask learning U-shaped network architecture (MLU-Net) for automatic and accurate fracture detection (including fracture areas and lines) from optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. We evaluated the performance and generalizability of MLU-Net through comprehensive experiments on the Amery, Thwaites Eastern, and Brunt ice shelves. Our results show that MLU-Net successfully maps the multitemporal fracture distributions over the three ice shelves in Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-1 SAR images, and that fusing the optical- and SAR-derived results enhances fracture detection. Quantitatively, MLU-Net achieves the highest F1 scores of 0.955 and 0.928 on the optical and SAR images, respectively, with a mean overall accuracy of 0.905 and a mean intersection over union of 0.792 across both image types. Beyond extracting fracture areas and lines, we formulated two fracture indices (fracture area-to-area and length-to-area ratios) that account for fracture distributions to characterize structural damage. Our findings indicate that the fracture area-to-area ratio is more sensitive to rift widening, while the fracture length-to-area ratio more effectively captures newly formed fractures with minimal sensitivity to image types and imaging conditions. Therefore, the proposed algorithm and fracture indices provide a promising framework for measuring ice shelf fractures at a continental scale, advancing the monitoring and modeling of ice shelf dynamics."

 Accurate classification of methane source infrastructure across sectors is critical for building comprehensive emission inventories and tracing emission sources. Existing approaches predominantly rely on high-resolution remote sensing imagery to capture discriminative features, but their scalability is limited by high costs and restricted availability. In contrast, medium-resolution imagery offers scalable alternatives with enhanced spectral signatures, while its lower spatial resolution challenges precise characterization and facility differentiation. To address this issue, we propose a multimodal fusion method on Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 data, with the aim of exploiting the complementary characteristics of optical, infrared, and SAR imagery to improve classification accuracy. We present a multimodal dynamic fusion network (DMFNet), which incorporates a gating module and multimodal attention fusion modules (MAFM) to adaptively address sample variability and multimodal heterogeneity. Additionally, DMFNet enables tracking and interpreting the fusion process by analyzing data-driven weights, providing deep insights into modality combinations and fusion strategies for specific facility. Experiments on the METER-ML dataset demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a precision of 0.740 and a recall of 0.757, outperforming existing single-modal and static fusion methods. Transferability experiments further confirm the practical applicability of the proposed method and its complementarity with existing open-source data in improving methane emission inventories."

 Monitoring water quality and understanding how estuarine ecosystems respond to environmental changes is essential to sustain their ecological integrity and associated ecosystem services. In this study, we demonstrate that Optical Water Type (OWT) classification from Sentinel-2 MSI can be used as a stand-alone product rather than an intermediate tool for algorithm refinement, providing valuable insights for environmental monitoring, using the Tagus Estuary as an example. In-situ measurements (Chl-a, temperature, salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen) were employed to characterize environmental conditions associated with OWT classes and to analyse the spatio-temporal and tidal variability during 2017–2024. We identified distinct water quality profiles among groups of OWTs, which were associated with marine, transitional and riverine waters with different physico-chemical characteristics that were related to different environmental drivers. Tides significantly influenced the distribution of OWTs, with high and neap tides favouring the occurrence of clearer marine waters. Specific OWT classes emerged as indicators for key environmental processes, including marine water intrusion, freshwater inputs and phytoplankton-rich waters. Time-series analysis revealed a trend of increasing marine waters inside the estuary alongside interannual variability driven by hydro-climatic forcings.

 Implementing high spectral resolution imaging from the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) paved the way for detailed retrieval of agricultural traits for accurate crop monitoring and management. The proposed methodology involves the integration and detailed analysis of Radiative Transfer Modelling (RTM) with an integrated approach of machine learning (ML) and Active Learning (AL) algorithms for the retrieval of the Leaf Chlorophyll Content (LCC), Carotenoids (Car) and Leaf Area index (LAI) of wheat cropland from the continuous three years of the dataset. Reflectance values of leaf were collected using Analytical Spectral Device (ASD) − Spectroradiometer data ranging from 350-2500 nm and EnMAP satellite hyperspectral data extends spectral data range varies between 420 nm to 1000 nm in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) of EMR region, and from 900 nm to 2450 nm in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) region for crop parameters mapping for a larger spatial area of Varanasi district, Uttar Pradesh, India. The PROSPECT + SAIL (PROSAIL) RTM was employed to simulate spectral (reflectance) data, and fourteen ML algorithms were assessed for implementation into a hybrid model. Kernel Ridge regression (KRR) was combined with Euclidean-based Diversity (EBD) algorithms to retrieve crop characteristics due to their exceptional accuracy and reduced uncertainty. Spectral profiles were further used to train hybrid models using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) feature selection, and combined techniques (ML + AL) were applied to retrieve LCC, Car, and LAI. Afterwards, biophysical and biochemical spatial large-scale estimation were provided through atmospherically corrected, and noise-removed EnMAP hyperspectral data with the help of a trained and tested hybrid (ML + AL) model and validated with the ground-measured datasets. The performance indicators showed significantly very high values of correlation during calibration (LCC = 0.99, Car = 0.74, and LAI = 0.99) and validation (LCC = 0.66, Car = 0.57, and LAI= 0.88).

 Full-waveform airborne LiDAR bathymetry (ALB) technology, in which the analyzed waveforms reflect the temporal positions and attribute information of targets, is effective in shallow water. However, weak seafloor echoes in full-waveform data induced by environmental and device characteristics are confused with noise signals, leading to difficulties in seafloor detection. This paper proposes a pregeneration–recognition method of detecting weak seafloor echoes for ALB. First, a two-stage local maximum algorithm is developed to identify potential seafloor echoes in waveforms and to pregenerate points. Then, an adaptive ellipsoidal neighborhood related to the point density is used to select neighborhood points, and eigenvalue-based spatial features are calculated. Finally, a back propagation neural network (BPNN) model is constructed using the points generated from surface–seafloor shots, and the seafloor points in seafloor-undefined shots are obtained by optimizing the BPNN results. The proposed method is verified on four swaths collected via the Optech Aquarius ALB system near Wuzhizhou Island and Ganquan Island in the South China Sea. The numbers of additional points detected with the proposed method near these two islands increase by 195.9 % and 40.1 % compared with the Aquarius system, which is better than the Richardson–Lucy deconvolution method. The coverages and maximum depth of seafloor points are improved and the accuracy evaluations demonstrate the credibility of the results. Therefore, the proposed pregeneration–recognition method can effectively improve the detection rate for weak seafloor echoes and the depth performance of ALB systems. Future research will focus on mitigating the impact of seafloor topography on the proposed method to expand its application scenarios."

 Savanna fires are a dominant ecological force in West Africa, shaping land systems, carbon dynamics, and biodiversity. Yet, their impacts on ecosystem productivity and recovery remain poorly quantified at meaningful spatial and temporal scales. This study presents a decadal assessment (2014–2023) of fire activity and post-fire vegetation response across a ∼ 229,000  km2 transboundary region of Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Côte d'Ivoire. Using Harmonized Landsat–Sentinel (HLS) imagery and VIIRS active fire detections, we mapped burned areas (BA) at 30  m resolution—capturing extensive small fires often missed by global datasets. Fire-induced Net Primary Productivity (NPP) losses were estimated using downscaled MODIS productivity data, and post-fire recovery times were tracked at monthly and annual scales. Fires were highly seasonal, with > 80 % of BA occurring between November and January, peaking in December. Despite a dip around 2017, interannual BA remained relatively stable (0.29 % yr−1 increase, p > 0.05). Immediate NPP losses averaged ∼ 11 × 10–2 Mg C ha−1 per year, with higher per-hectare losses in forested and high-biomass zones. Roughly 65 % of BA recovered to pre-fire NPP levels within a year, primarily in grasslands and croplands. However, recovery in woody and mesic areas was slower and more variable. We emphasize that recovery was assessed in terms of NPP (carbon uptake), not structural biomass or species composition—functional recovery does not necessarily imply full ecological recovery. Using machine learning, we identified soil moisture (dry-season NDMI) and temperature as dominant predictors of recovery time, with soil fertility (nitrogen content) and water retention capacity emerging as key drivers. Interestingly, fire frequency and land cover type had limited predictive power once climate and soil factors were accounted for, suggesting that environmental factors, more than fire regime characteristics, shape recovery. These findings support the idea that well-timed, low-intensity fires—particularly early-season burns—can promote carbon resilience in fire-adapted landscapes. This underscores the value of high-resolution remote sensing and soil data in guiding fire-smart management and balancing ecological and livelihood goals under climate change."

 Estimating room layout from panoramas is a new trend in the holistic reconstruction of the 3D environment. However, a single panorama is easily occluded by walls and furniture, making it hard to reconstruct the whole indoor room accurately and completely. Besides, deep learning room layout estimating methods often perform poorly in unseen scenes. To address this need, this paper proposes an accurate room layout estimation method from multi-view panoramas with multi-label graph cut. The proposed method takes full advantage of each panorama by utilizing multi-label graph cut. First, room layouts of each panorama are estimated with pre-trained deep-learning models and projected to the ground as the labels; then, a geometry-aware ray-casting method is utilized to obtain the initial floorplan; next, the initial floorplan is regularized by multi-label graph cut with the estimated labels from each panorama; in the end, the final layouts of each panorama is obtained by transforming the regularized floorplans and estimated ceiling heights into layouts with panorama geometry. Experiments in the recently released multi-view panoramas dataset show that the proposed method can regularize the initial floorplan to a floorplan with accurate geometry. Furthermore, the accuracy of the layouts surpassed the layout estimation accuracy of the single panorama deep learning models (HorizonNet and LGTNet) and the state-of-the-art self-training layout estimation models with multi-view panoramas by a large margin."

Through weighted majority voting, the ensemble model achieved superior accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score compared to individual models, enhancing the reliability of geospatial mapping under variable urban and weather conditions.

 Generating composite images from satellite data is crucial for crop mapping over defined periods. However, producing reliable composites for cropland segmentation presents challenges, particularly in maintaining temporal coherence and preserving key phenological stages in time series data. This study proposes a compositing method that improves temporal coherence for tracking phenological stages in deep learning–based cropland segmentation. The compositing method integrates the near–infrared to blue band reflectance ratio with a Gaussian weighting function to prioritize pixel selection based on temporal proximity to the center of the target month. Sentinel–2 monthly time series composites were generated using Google Earth Engine and evaluated through proximity analysis to assess pixel distribution within the target month and correlations with consecutive months. The performance of deep learning models trained on these composites was further assessed by comparing their segmentation results. To evaluate generalizability, the method was applied across various study areas and across different crop types and environmental conditions. The results consistently show that proposed method outperforms other techniques in preserving temporal continuity, reducing cloud–related noise, and maintaining the coherence necessary for deep learning models to effectively track crop growth patterns."

 To better monitor global water resources, and understand how they will vary in the future, it is critical to track the extent and intensity of irrigated agriculture. Within the past decade, there has been increased interest in the satellite-based detection of anomalous soil moisture (SM) and/or evapotranspiration (ET) signals associated with irrigation. However, little comparative information is available concerning the relative merits of available ET versus SM satellite products for this purpose. Such uncertainty has hampered the development of optimal monitoring strategies that appropriately integrate information acquired across a range of remote sensing resources. Here, using relatively more mature irrigation products derived from a combination of ground data and visible/near-infrared remote sensing as a reference, we compare the skill of microwave (MW) SM and thermal-infrared (TIR) ET satellite products for mapping coarse-scale (36-km) spatial variations in the proportion of land irrigated across the conterminous United States. Results suggest that, while spatial mapping skill exists in both products, the irrigation signal in satellite-based ET products is stronger, and easier to interpret, than the analogous signal in SM products. Since MW-based SM and TIR-based ET products appear to possess approximately equal spatial precision (i.e., spatial correlations with respect to true SM and ET, respectively), this difference is attributed to the stronger impact of irrigation on spatial ET patterns versus surface SM.Plain Language Summary: To better monitor global water resources, and understand how they will vary in the future, it is important to track the extent and intensity of irrigated agriculture. To do this, different satellite-based methods have been proposed to track irrigation from space. Unfortunately, there has been little comparison of these methods, and it is unclear which ones work best. Here, we compare methods for monitoring irrigation based on two different remote sensing techniques: thermal infrared and passive microwave.

 Accurate mapping of rice cultivation regions is essential for addressing global food challenges and developing climate adaptation strategies. In large-scale paddy rice mapping, obtaining sufficient training samples that capture the range of phenological variations is difficult. Cloud contamination and missing data complicate the collection of spatially and temporally complete observations for reliable rice mapping missions. This study introduces the Sentinel-1/-2 phenology-enhanced paddy rice (SPRC) mapping framework. Automated rice mapping is achieved by integrating Sentinel-2 phenology, Sentinel-1 V-shape features, Jeffries–Matusita distance, SPRC-based feature selection, and multi-layer probabilistic random forest classification with voting. The method demonstrated robust performance across varying weather conditions, achieving overall accuracy and F1 scores of 96.21 % and 96.66 in Heilongjiang Province (HLJ), China, and 95.76 % and 95.62 in Sakata (Sak), Yamagata, Japan, respectively, outperforming previous approaches. When compared with statistical data in HLJ, the maps exhibit a highly linear correlation and achieve an R2 value of 0.996, corresponding to a paddy rice area of just 1.1 % less than the reported average. The results reveal that the optimal time-series feature combinations for paddy rice mapping are strongly affected by spatial, temporal, and weather-related variations. The SPRC framework successfully produced rice maps for HLJ from 2019 to 2021 and for Sak in 2020. These findings illustrate the SPRC framework’s efficacy and precision in mapping paddy rice. The 3-year rice data are invaluable for food surveillance, regional agricultural monitoring, and policy-making."

 Soil moisture (SM) is a critical driver of crop growth and a key indicator of agriculture monitoring. Efficient and accurate SM monitoring is essential for advancing sustainable agricultural practices. The zero-order radiative transfer model (τ-ω), widely used for SM estimation from passive microwave satellites, simplifies the characterization of vegetation-covered surfaces by neglecting multiple scattering effects. However, its canopy transmissivity calculations within this framework remain limiting. To address this gap, this study proposes a ratio-based approach to quantify vegetation transmissivity, capitalizing on unique features of passive microwave radiative transfer over vegetated surfaces. The method is then integrated into the Single Channel Algorithm (SCA) and the L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere (L-MEB) model, respectively, to improve the accuracy of SM retrieval. To mitigate the weather-related constraints of optical data, the study is further to investigate the integration of the Radar Vegetation Index (RVI) into the enhanced models. Experimental results demonstrate that the ratio-based method effectively refines vegetation transmissivity estimations, thereby enhancing SM retrieval accuracy: For L-MEB model, R increased from 0.63 to 0.72 and RMSE decreased from 0.119 m3/m3 to 0.061 m3/m3; for SCA-H and SCA-V, R increased from 0.48 and 0.54 to 0.71 and 0.63, and RMSE decreased from 0.150 m3/m3 and 0.102 m3/m3 to 0.053 m3/m3 and 0.067 m3/m3, respectively. This study presents a novel approach for SM retrieval. This work underscores the potential of the ratio-based method to improve SM assessments across diverse environmental and climatic conditions."

 Accurate identification of winter wheat from remote sensing imagery is crucial for large-scale agricultural monitoring. Despite the success of Transformer-based deep learning models in various fields, their application in crop identification has been limited by the scarcity of extensive labeled training data. This study proposes a dual-branch spatio-temporal Transformer (DST-Transformer) for winter wheat extraction from Sentinel-2 imagery using a small training dataset. By independently extracting temporal and spatial features, the DST-Transformer effectively delineates crop boundaries and reduces misclassification. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness with small training datasets, achieving over 90% overall accuracy (OA) and 88.25% mean intersection over union (MIoU) when evaluating on test datasets. The DST-Transformer was further applied to large-scale winter wheat extraction across Shandong Province, China (an area 66 times larger than the training region) to evaluate its cross-regional transferability. Evaluation results showed OA over 92% and MIoU exceeding 85% at all validation sites, highlighting the DST-Transformer’s robustness and strong generalization capability. This study underscores the DST-Transformer’s potential for large-scale crop identification and illustrates the promise of Transformer-based architectures for efficient, high-precision crop mapping with small training datasets, advancing the application of deep learning in agricultural remote sensing."

 Over the past 40 years, plastic-mulched farmland (PMF) has become a widely distributed and seasonally dynamic land use/land management type, driven by its significant contributions to improving crop yield and quality. However, expansion of PMF has far-reaching impacts on the climate, the environment, and rural livelihoods. In particular, the exposure duration of plastic mulching (EDPM) over the course of a year is a critical factor influencing climate change and the energy balance, underscoring the need for a novel approach to accurately characterize EDPM. However, accurately characterizing EDPM remains challenging and has yet to be implemented in practice. Therefore, this study proposes a spectral index-based approach to characterize EDPM at the object scale using Sentinel-2 imagery in the Hetao Irrigation District, China. First, an object-oriented machine learning approach was implemented to map the spatial distribution of PMF. This was achieved by optimizing both the scale parameter of image segmentation and input feature sets (including spectral, textural, geometric, and index features) extracted from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery, through iterative masking and stepwise optimization. Then, the time series of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), PMLI (Plastic-Mulched Landcover Index), and BSI (Bare Soil Index), along with their first and second derivatives, were analyzed to determine key timings, including the start day of plastic mulching, crop growing, and crop canopy closure. Finally, the EDPM, including Full exposure duration of plastic-mulching (FEDPM) and half exposure duration of plastic-mulching (HEDPM), was characterized based on these key timings. The result indicated that the object-oriented machine learning approach is highly effective in enhancing PMF detection and suppressing background information. The overall accuracy and the Kappa coefficient were 91.5 % and 0.90. In addition, plastic-mulching primarily occurs in late April in the eastern part of the Hetao Irrigation District, and in late May in the western region. The crop growing takes place in early to late June, while the crop canopy closure mainly occurs in early August. Consequently, the EDPM lasts approximately 3 to 4 months, while the FEDPM and HEDPM last about 1 to 2 months. This research provides a valuable reference for characterizing EDPM at regional or global scales and can be used to assess the regional climate effects of PMF."

 Forest canopy height is a key indicator for estimating forest carbon sinks and managing vegetation growth. Existing methods for fusing optical and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data still have limitations in canopy height estimation for boreal forests. In this study, we develop a forest canopy height estimation model (VGG-AdaBins) that leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract deep features from multi-source remote sensing data. By introducing an adaptive tree height distribution estimation module, the model enables the coupling of multi-source remote sensing data for forest canopy height estimation. A joint validation dataset is constructed, including Sentinel-1/2, PALSAR images, airborne LVIS LiDAR, and spaceborne ICESat-2 photon-counting LiDAR data. This dataset is used to train the canopy height model. Finally, the performance of the canopy height prediction model is evaluated using 100 independent airborne datasets. The model’s prediction of tree height shows an MAE of 1.42 m and a RMSE of 2.25 m. The predicted 30 m canopy height map exhibits good consistency with the existing airborne data and demonstrated higher accuracy compared with current forest canopy height maps, with an accuracy improvement of at least 20%. The high prediction accuracy demonstrates that VGG-AdaBins, by integrating multi-source remote sensing data, can map continuous canopy height at the regional scale.

 Mapping surface water at high spatiotemporal resolution is critical for managing water resources and mitigating disasters. Current global surface water datasets are typically generated at a relatively coarse monthly temporal resolution and 30-meter spatial resolution. Moreover, the mixed pixel problem further limits their ability to precisely map small water bodies.

Different from the analysis-ready wall-to-wall global datasets, DSWF is generated on-demand online in response to user-defined areas of interest and time. DSWF explored sub-pixel surface water fraction information at 10-meter spatial resolution, enabling the precise representation of fine-scale spatial features of surface water and minimizing the blurring artifacts commonly associated with conventional hard classification. The accuracy of DSWF was evaluated across 113 validation tiles, demonstrating an overall root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.090 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.021 when validated against both pure and mixed pixels.

 Leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) is a crucial parameter reflecting vegetation’s photosynthetic activity. Many LCC inversion algorithms based on satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data have been developed in recent decades. The one-dimensional radiative transfer model, like PROSAIL (1D model), has been a classic tool for LCC inversion. In recent years, three-dimensional radiative transfer models (3D model) have been developed rapidly. However, studies on 3D models for LCC inversion are limited, and their impact on inversion accuracy across different sensor resolutions remains unclear. This study focuses on winter wheat and integrates the DART, Adel-Wheat, and PROSPECT models to construct the 3D-model-derived look-up table (LUT). The 3D-model-based LUT and 1D-model-based LUT were applied to Sentinel-2 (S2) and UAV data to retrieve LCC. Validation results demonstrate that the 3D-model-based algorithm significantly improves LCC inversion accuracy for both S2 and UAV images. For UAV data, the root mean square error (RMSE) decreases from 9.90 μg/cm2 to 7.97 μg/cm2, and the coefficient of determination (R2) improves from 0.70 to 0.79. For S2 data, the RMSE decreases from 12.40 μg/cm2 to 8.68 μg/cm2, while R2 increases from 0.66 to 0.85. Additionally, overestimation at low LAI levels and underestimation at high LCC levels are effectively reduced. The high accuracy achieved under varying LAI and LCC conditions allows the 3D model to capture temporal trends throughout the growing season better. The 3D-model-based LCC inversion algorithm can better utilize the high spatial resolution advantages, thereby playing a significant role in vegetation physiological monitoring and crop phenotyping."

 Geohazards are sudden and catastrophic. Due to the complicated topography, geology and climate conditions along the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Transportation Corridor (QTPTC), many geohazards pose unprecedented challenges for engineering construction. Comprehensive and scientific geohazard detection has been infrequently performed in the QTPTC, so the study area still lacks a comprehensive geological hazard inventory. With the development of earth observation techniques, detecting geohazards in wide areas is possible. However, comprehensive geohazard detection over such a large spatial extent is considered impossible by individual remote sensing techniques and images. In this study, we used a combination of GACOS-assisted Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) phases, SAR amplitudes, and optical images to acquire deformational and geomorphological information of geohazards along the QTPTC. Based on deformational and geomorphological information, we establish a catalogue containing 2109 geohazards which were classified into five categories, i) actively deforming slopes (994); ii) reactivated historically deformed slopes (84); iii) stabilized historically deformed slopes (732); iv) glacier (283) and v) glacial lakes (16). A large percentage of geohazards are distributed at an elevation of 2500–5000 m with slope angles of 30-40°, five geohazards concentration regions are distributed on main active fault zones, and the types of geohazards in the five regions are influenced by precipitation and surface temperature.

 Grasslands play a crucial role in carbon cycling, biodiversity conservation, and human welfare. Identifying the drivers of grassland greening is essential for forecasting ecosystem responses to future climate change and developing effective adaptation strategies. Grasslands worldwide have experienced pronounced greening trends over recent decades. Despite this widespread phenomenon, the underlying biophysical mechanisms and dominant drivers remain insufficiently understood. By integrating satellite observations with model simulations, we show consistent increases in global grassland leaf area index (LAI) across both historical periods and future scenarios. A sustained increase in summer LAI is identified as the primary driver of grassland greening, contributing approximately 43.28% to the overall trend. Grassland greening exhibits strong spatial heterogeneity, with humid regions accounting for the largest contribution (i.e., 67.27%). Correlation analysis, structural equation modeling, and ridge regression reveal distinct regional differences in the dominant drivers across aridity gradients. Soil moisture (SM) emerges as the primary driver in arid regions, while temperature plays a more prominent role in semi-arid areas. In sub-humid and humid regions, vapor pressure deficit (VPD) exerts a stronger influence on grassland LAI dynamics. Moreover, the synergistic effect of temperature and VPD enhances summer greening, particularly in humid regions and high-latitude areas of the Northern Hemisphere. Notably, the influence of VPD transitions from inhibitory in arid regions to facilitative in humid environments. In contrast, the role of SM in shaping vegetation dynamics weakens progressively along the aridity gradient. These findings advance our understanding of how grassland ecosystems respond to varying hydroclimatic conditions and offer key insights for forecasting vegetation dynamics under future climate change."

Although Multi-Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) provides detailed displacement measurements, its application in continuous monitoring remains constrained by high computational demands and complex data processing, often interrupting observation continuity. To address these challenges, this study proposes a deep learning-based method that processes wrapped Differential InSAR (D-InSAR) interferograms to directly detect surface deformation patterns. A Fringe-Labeling Model (FLM) was developed to identify deformation regions, followed by a Fringe-Detection Model (FDM) using Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (Faster R-CNN) to classify deformation magnitudes. The method achieved an average mean Average Precision (mAP) of 83.9% in Central Taiwan. Temporal transferability was validated by detecting deformation one year beyond the original MT-InSAR observation period. Spatial transferability was confirmed by applying the model to Northern Taiwan, where an F1 score of 78.74% was achieved while effectively identifying both uplift and subsidence. By enabling deformation detection across different magnitudes, time periods, and regions, the proposed framework offers a scalable and transferable solution for extending MT-InSAR-based surface hazard tracking."

 Earth observation satellites play a crucial role in disaster response and management, offering timely and large-scale data for damage assessment. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of deep learning techniques for automated building damage detection from satellite imagery, often based on the xBD dataset. This high-quality dataset features bi-temporal very-high-resolution image pairs of several disaster events. Notably, several studies have proposed new network architectures and demonstrated their improved performance on xBD. Although such highly engineered model-centric approaches achieve promising results on the original dataset split of xBD, we show that they underperform on a new event-based split, which evaluates them on unseen events. To reduce this generalization gap, we propose to follow a data-centric approach. For this, we first derive a simplified baseline method from the winning solution of the xView2 competition, with greatly reduced complexity. With a simple adjustment to this baseline method, we incorporate readily available disaster-type information, allowing it to account for disaster-specific damage characteristics. We evaluate the resulting disaster-adaptive model on the event-based split of xBD and demonstrate its improved ability to generalize to unseen events compared to several competing methods. These results highlight the potential of our data-centric approach for practical and robust building damage assessment in real-world disaster scenarios.

 Biodiversity decline due to global change poses a pressing challenge for conservation efforts worldwide. To improve the efficiency of conservation projects, spatially explicit information on species richness is needed, yet this information is challenging to generate from traditional biodiversity assessments. To fill this gap, we here explored the potential of spaceborne remote sensing techniques, including Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and EnMAP, for mapping species richness across four distinct taxonomic groups (fungi, plants, insects and birds) in a complex mountain landscape in the German Alps. We used all sensors individually, as well as different combinations of data (Sentinel-1/2, EnMAP/Sentinel-1/2), and compared predictions to predictions based on LiDAR data – a well-proven standard in mapping species richness. Our results showed that a combination of EnMAP/Sentinel-1/2 performed as well or even better than airborne LiDAR data for predicting species richness, but predictive accuracies of individual spaceborne models were substantially lower. This suggests that optical, radar and hyperspectral data carry complementary information and combining this information unleashes the full potential of spaceborne data for species richness mapping. However, validating models by habitat type revealed higher errors within habitat types (i.e., forest or open habitat), especially for immobile species (fungi and plants) that likely vary at smaller spatial scales than the resolution of the spaceborne systems used in this study. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of spaceborne remote sensing for large-scale biodiversity assessments, offering valuable insights into spatial biodiversity patterns and their changes over time."

 Change detection in very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery has consistently been a focus and challenge within the remote sensing community. We present a novel unsupervised method named Progressive Self-Optimization Network. In this method, a new sample strategy is developed based on the initial change detection across three feature domains: spectral, deep, and class signal, to capture the “weak-to-strong” change signals and collect training samples with high accuracy. A new lightweight convolutional neural network is designed by partially replacing traditional convolutional layers with weight-shared partial convolution. To detect changes, a progressive self-optimization pattern is proposed based on the “weak-to-strong” change signals. This pattern detects changes gradually from regions with weak and strong change signals to regions with moderate change signals in a progressive manner. During this progressive process, detection results from each progression are integrated with “weak-to-strong” change signals to reselect training samples for the transfer training in the following progression, thus attempting to optimize the lightweight network. The final change map is generated by fusing all progression results. Five open VHR datasets and fourteen state-of-the-art unsupervised methods validate the proposed method."

 Assessing sea surface nitrate (SSN) concentrations and dynamics is crucial for understanding marine ecosystem health, yet optical remote sensing of SSN remains challenging because of the lack of distinct spectral features. While various global-scale SSN regression and machine learning algorithms based on SSN-environment variable relationships have been developed, the prediction accuracy and spatiotemporal resolution of their applications continue to face limitations. Additionally, there has been relatively little reporting on the interannual variability of global SSN in previous studies. Here we aim to enhance the accuracy and spatial resolution of SSN retrievals by developing improved regression and machine learning models, enabling the generation of global daily ∼ 8 km SSN products from satellite and model data. To construct the empirical regression models, the global ocean was divided into five regions on the basis of the relationship between sea surface temperature (SST) and SSN: 80° S to 40° N, the North Pacific, the North Atlantic, the Arabian Sea, and the eastern equatorial Pacific. After adding SSN-related physical variables, high-accuracy regional empirical models are developed, with root mean square deviations (RMSDs) of 1.641, 2.701, 1.221, 1.298, and 2.379 μmol/kg for the studied regions. For the machine learning models, seven algorithms, namely, extremely randomized trees (ET), multilayer perceptron (MLP), stacking random forest (SRF), Gaussian process regression (GPR), support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithms, were tested. After modeling, validation, and extensive tests using independent cruise dataset, the XGBoost model outperformed others (RMSD = 1.189 μmol/kg) and bypassed the need for regional segmentation. Mechanistic analysis revealed the driving variables influencing SSN in both regional empirical and XGBoost models, improving interpretability. Comparative validation confirmed that our models surpass traditional approaches in accuracy and applicability, demonstrating their potential to advance global SSN monitoring. Using XGBoost-derived products, we find a slight weak decreasing trend in SSN over 23 years.

 Secondary mangrove forests are ecosystems that regenerate in areas where original mangrove stands have been degraded or removed as a result of natural disturbances or anthropogenic activities. Compared to mature mangrove forests, secondary stands exhibit enhanced carbon accumulation, increased sediment trapping efficiency, and intensified nitrogen fixation, contributing significantly to coastal eutrophication mitigation. Accurately mapping secondary mangroves and determining their age is essential for sustainable ecosystem management and assessing their services. However, reliably determining mangrove forest age using remote sensing has been hindered by the complex dynamics of intertidal environments. To overcome these challenges, we developed a robust and efficient approach for estimating the age of secondary mangrove forests (ASMF) by integrating Landsat time-series data and the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm. We implemented this method in the Dongzhaigang National Nature Reserve (DNNR), which is the first mangrove nature reserve established in China, achieving a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.723. Key findings include: (1) the ASMF estimates exhibited high accuracy (R2 = 0.723), with optimal performance for forests aged 9–10 years; (2) secondary mangrove forests comprised 47 % (823.87 ha) of the total mangrove area within the DNNR; and (3) younger stands (1–9 years) represented 32 % of all secondary mangrove forests. This approach offers an effective solution for regional-scale mangrove age estimation and provides a critical basis for evaluating the carbon sequestration potential of secondary mangroves in the DNNR."

 Cropland non-agriculturalization (CNA) monitoring is a typical change detection (CD) problem based on remote sensing imagery, aimed at tracking cropland outflow changes, which holds significant importance for cropland protection and food security. Recently, numerous advanced CD methods have been proposed to address the CNA problem. However, applying these methods to cross-regional or large-scale CNA detection presents several challenges: (1) Radiance-feature differences of croplands across regions i.e., crop type and phenology differences arising from variations in planting structures and seasonality; (2) Change-pattern differences of croplands across regions, i.e., differences in predominant change types resulting from distinct regional economic development characteristics. These cross-regional differences, when coupled together, result in insufficient adaptability of CD methods across regions. To address these issues, a Cross-Region Cropland Change Detection (CR-CLCD) framework with Multi-View Domain Adaptation (MVDA) is proposed. Specifically, Pattern Distribution Contrastive (PDC) sub-module achieves feature alignment from the semantic view by imposing contrastive constraints across inter-domain categories. Radiative Discrepancy Adversarial (RDA) sub-module, performs inter-domain global and local feature confusion by identifying regions of local uncertainty and applying enhanced adversarial training. MVDA is a flexible, plug-and-play domain adaptation module that can be seamlessly integrated with any existing change detection backbone network (e.g., CNN, Transformer), enabling rapid generalization to new data under unsupervised conditions. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CR-CLCD method achieves the best or second-best accuracy compared to other domain adaptation methods across different baselines."

 Ground-measured fractional vegetation cover (FVC) data are critical for validating satellite-derived FVC products. However, spatial scale mismatches between ground plots and satellite pixels, compounded by the scarcity of field data in remote regions, introduce significant uncertainties in product validation. This study proposes a novel multi-tiered representativeness framework integrating three key indices: the absolute difference of spatial upscaling transformations, the heterogeneity of the surrounding environment, and FVC temporal stability. The framework’s implementation leveraged an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) observation network (870 monitoring plots, 2015–2024) within the alpine grassland ecosystem of the Three-River Source Region on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, classified into four levels, with levels 1–2 indicating high level and 3–4 lower. Our results reveal that both the environmental heterogeneity of monitoring plots and scale mismatches substantially impact the validation accuracy of FVC products. By applying the proposed framework, validation using high-level monitoring plots reduced uncertainty by approximately 40 % compared to using all monitoring plots (GEOV3: R2 = 0.964, RMSE = 0.075 vs. R2 = 0.830, RMSE = 0.138; GLASS: R2 = 0.957, RMSE = 0.068 vs. R2 = 0.812, RMSE = 0.121), highlighting its effectiveness in mitigating spatial representativeness errors. Furthermore, the validation results for two global FVC products (GEOV3 and GLASS) highlight systematic biases in their performance within alpine ecosystems. These findings advance validation methodologies for remote sensing products in heterogeneous landscapes and provide actionable insights for improving algorithm parameterization.

 Urban trees play a crucial role in delivering ecosystem services, yet their structural complexity poses significant challenges for remote sensing. Although recent large-scale, open-access canopy height models (CHMs) offer potential alternatives to airborne LiDAR, their suitability for urban environments remains uncertain. This study systematically evaluated four prominent CHMs (Potapov, Lang, Tolan, and Malambo) using high-resolution airborne LiDAR data from Washington, D.C., with complementary analyses from four additional cities. We assessed their performance in both canopy classification and height prediction using classification and regression metrics, spatial autocorrelation, consistency tests, and explainable machine learning. Results revealed consistent limitations across products, including widespread misclassification of canopy, systematic tree height prediction biases — characterized by overestimation of low and underestimation of high canopies (the OLUH effect) — and pronounced spatial clustering of errors along urban–forest edges. Among the models, only the Lang CHM passed the Bland–Altman consistency test, showing marginal statistical agreement with reference data. Tree characteristic variables, especially canopy height itself, emerged as dominant drivers of height errors, while topography and built-up context also contributed. Consistent patterns observed across four additional cities indicated that these limitations are systemic rather than location-specific. We conclude that high-precision airborne LiDAR remains essential for urban forestry and recommend enhancing canopy height mapping techniques to better capture the structure of urban trees. A promising direction is the development of urban-specific CHMs with finer spatial and temporal resolution, improved temporal consistency, and integration with high-resolution imagery, contextual deep learning models, and local calibration strategies."

 Accurate and timely building damage assessment (BDA) is critical for effective disaster response and recovery. However, existing machine learning approaches in this context do mostly not account for uncertainties, which are essential for ensuring trustworthy and transparent results. This study introduces a hybrid Bayesian deep learning framework with integrated uncertainty quantification to enhance BDA, thereby making model predictions more reliable and interpretable. We propose BayeSiamMTL, a novel Bayesian Siamese multitask learning architecture that combines deterministic segmentation of building footprints with probabilistic change detection for damage level classification. By encoding model parameters as probability distributions and utilizing variational inference with Monte Carlo approximation, BayeSiamMTL produces pixelwise posterior predictive distributions, providing detailed insights into both damage predictions and their associated uncertainties. Our analysis explores key aspects of Bayesian modeling and, to our knowledge, is the first to provide quantified insights into the model’s classification dynamics, revealing internal decision-making tendencies and sources of uncertainty. Additionally, we introduce confidence-informed damage maps in the form of stratified probabilities of damage clusters and minimum/maximum damage extents delineated from confidence intervals. Model performance is evaluated across multiple datasets to assess the impact of domain shifts and out-of-distribution samples. Experimental results show that BayeSiamMTL not only achieves a performance advantage over its deterministic counterpart but also exhibits significantly better generalization capabilities under domain shifts with a relative performance improvement of 42 %. While background pixels represent the primary source of confusion across all damage levels, our findings indicate that building destructions are more frequently confused with intact buildings rather than among varying degrees of damage."

 The phase coherence of radar signals makes synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image analysis prone to significant challenges. Echo signal interference introduces speckle noise during imaging; noise appears as random fluctuations in pixel intensities. Besides, coherence exacerbates geometric distortions, complicating the accurate interpretation of spatial distributions within intricate geographic entities, thereby making it difficult to extract meaningful target information from SAR images. Addressing these challenges, this study introduces the DEcomposed-frequency PrOjection Network (Depo-Net), a segmentation-oriented model that mitigates SAR-specific interference through frequency-domain self-attention. It employs a dual-encoder structure for efficient semantic extraction and integrates Spatio-Frequency Synergistic Modulation (SFSM) to minimize speckle noise while maintaining structural integrity in the frequency domain. Additionally, the Harmonized Subspace Spectro-Temporal Attention (HSSTA) synthesizes Discrete Fourier and Wavelet Transform analyses to capture complex spatial correlations among geographic features. To mitigate noise amplification during decoding, the Pluri-frequency Mamba (purfMamba) module synergizes multi-dimensional spectral-spatial features, facilitating noise suppression during high-resolution restoration and maintaining a balance between global structure and local details.

 Variations in Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) significantly influence flooding patterns, particularly through alterations in forest and cropland. However, existing flood prediction studies rarely utilize LULC maps as direct training inputs, typically generating probabilistic rather than spatially explicit flood distribution maps. This study addresses this gap by integrating Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with multi-source remote sensing data to predict flood distribution from LULC maps. We focus specifically on “Returning Cropland to Forest” initiative of China using 2020 remote sensing data from the Poyang Lake region. Flood impact ranges were extracted through Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical data fusion, producing 3,972 LULC-flood map pairs for model training and validation. The multi-source fusion approach achieved substantial improvements in flood extraction accuracy. User accuracy increased from 60% (SAR-only) to 90% (SAR-optical fusion), while overall classification accuracy reached 89.76% with an F1 score of 94.58%. Model performance validation through Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) scores demonstrated high-quality flood map generation, with FID decreasing from 81.5 to 53 at epoch 45. Analysis revealed that reforestation ratios exceeding 50% significantly reduce flood occurrence. Optimal effectiveness was observed when forests are strategically positioned along rivers and lake edges rather than randomly distributed. These findings provide actionable guidance for planners to prioritize riparian zones for initial reforestation, then systematically achieve 50% reforestation ratios in flood-prone watersheds, integrating these targets within existing regulatory frameworks.

 Under cloudy and rainy conditions, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can provide essential data support for large-scale and high-timeliness flood monitoring. Although an optimal combination for Sentinel-1 VV-VH polarization data has been selected for flood mapping, its performance on complex terrains is not satisfactory, and it is unknown whether it can be further extended to generalize co- and cross-polarization data (not only VV-VH but also HH-HV). Therefore, we propose a shadow-robust unsupervised flood mapping method, called Topography and Dual-polarization Flood Mapping (TODFLOM). This method initially utilizes topography features to identify safe areas where floods are unlikely to occur in complex scenarios. Then, a Generalized Dual-Polarization Flood Index (GDPFI), based on the microwave scattering characteristics of complex inundation scenarios, is constructed to highlight flood features. Finally, GDPFI coupled with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is used for generating the flood map, enabling the method to effectively suppress mountain shadows in areas with slopes below 30°. The integration of topography features and GDPFI-GMM empowers TODFLOM to remove shadows impact with a 5° safety threshold. Experiments reveal that TODFLOM achieves an F1 score greater than 0.88 across all four flood datasets, outperforming other advanced methods in large-scale complex inundation scenarios."

 Frequent abnormal bareness events on Earth’s surfaces (ABEES) seriously threaten ecosystem stability and the safety of people’s lives and property, and it is urgent to carry out fine detection and timely warning. However, existing remote sensing indices for ABEES detection are only applicable to one or two types of ABEES and easily confuse different background information with ABEES, which makes it difficult to achieve fine detection of multiple types of ABEES in complex and unknown scenes. Therefore, this study proposed an index for the fine detection of multitype ABEES (ABEESI). Specifically, this study first conducted a comparative analysis of the shape and position differences in spectral curves between various ABEES and different ground objects. Then, representative bands that effectively capture these differences were selected to construct ABEESI. To evaluate the performance of the proposed index, six common types of ABEES and a large unknown scenario (Mongolia) were selected for testing. The validation results indicated that ABEESI achieves an F1-score exceeding 0.84 for detecting multiple types of ABEES, which is significantly better than traditional remote sensing indices, especially in cases of landslides, debris flows, and sand boils. Meanwhile, ABEESI still maintains good performance in a large unknown scenario, with a detection accuracy F1-score still exceeding 0.81. Overall, ABEESI is less affected by different background environments, effectively overcoming the limitations of traditional remote sensing indices that easily confuse ABEES with bright barren lands, artificial surfaces and other background environments. Moreover, ABEESI can effectively reflect different ABEES states, which makes it possible to provide an early warning in the early stages of ABEES and terminate warnings when the anomaly areas begin to recover."

 Movement uncertainty modeling is essential for reliable human mobility analytics, especially in indoor spaces with denied Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals and complex human motion modes. However, the performance of current uncertainty modelling approaches is hindered by the dynamic spatial–temporal correlations within the indoor human movement trajectory. To tackle these problems, this paper proposes a novel uncertainty modelling framework UMTrajNet to address indoor human movement reconstruction, movement uncertainty error prediction, and uncertainty region modelling. A spatiotemporal structure is designed by combining the Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) network and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, enabling adaptive learning the spatial and temporal features of human movement. An adaptive Euclidean distance method is employed to generate continuous uncertainty regions for the selected indoor trajectory based on extracted spatiotemporal features. By integrating GCN with LSTM, UMTrajNet effectively captures the complex spatial–temporal dependencies within the trajectory data thereby overcoming the limitations of traditional solely LSTM-based models in spatial context correlation modeling. Real-world experimental results indicate that the presented UMTrajNet significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline models in uncertainty modelling across different datasets."

 Based on the two Sheveluch eruption events on April 10, 2023 and August 17, 2024, the comprehensive phenomenon of the two volcanic eruption events is described from the analysis of the seismic activity sequence of the lithosphere to the distribution of atmospheric materials and heat. The seismic distribution in Sheveluch volcanic area is mainly shallow-source (0–70 km) and small-earthquake (ML 3.5–4.0). The April 2023 volcanic eruption released 3692.8 kt SO2 (vs. 26.21 kt in August 2024), with broader dispersion (100°W) and extended atmospheric retention, reflecting fundamental differences in eruption dynamics and atmospheric transport patterns. Based on the time series analysis, SO2 and UV aerosol index exhibit significant responses to the volcano eruption events. Vertical trajectory modeling and aerosol layer height (ALH) results indicate eruption column heights of 10 km and 8–9 km for the April 10, 2023 and August 17, 2024 volcanic events, respectively. Notably, positive temperature anomalies observed in the lower stratosphere show potential correlations with volcanic eruption. Comparing the ozone profile with the temperature profile, the ozone depletion may result in a decrease in stratospheric temperature. Volcanic eruption heights at the tropopause level may have an amplifying impact effect on the lower stratosphere. The description of the horizontal and vertical migration processes of atmospheric materials during volcanic eruption is of great significance for the study of multi-layer coupling mechanism."

 Background and aimAdverse birth outcomes, like term low birth weight (TLBW) and preterm birth (PTB), can be indicators for poor health outcomes, including neonatal mortality, and may be caused by environmental exposures. Previously, exposure to high ambient temperatures was linked with increased odds of TLBW, while results looking at fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure have been mixed. A growing body of studies report associations between PTB and air pollution. We evaluated the relationship between PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy and TLBW and PTB, and potential modification by concurrent exposure to extreme heat events (EHEs).MethodsWe used North Carolina birth registry data linked to exposure data using geocoded addresses obtained from the birth records (2006–2015) for live, singleton births (n = 1,280,064). TLBW was defined as births delivered at ≥37 weeks gestation and weighing <2,500g. PTB was defined as births delivered at <37 weeks gestation. PM2.5 concentrations were obtained using EPA's fused CMAQ model and were averaged over trimester and entire pregnancy. EHEs were defined as a census-tract specific daily maximum heat index >95th percentile for at least two consecutive days. The 95th percentile threshold for the EHE indicator variable were based on a 40-yr (1981–2020) historical distribution and specific to each census tract. For inclusion in a trimester analysis for summer months, portions of that trimester had to occur between May–September. We estimated risk differences with interaction terms for total number of EHEs during the corresponding exposure period.ResultsWe observed generally null relationships between PM2.5 and TLBW and PTB for all trimesters. Results remained null when extreme heat events were included as an interaction term and no interaction on the multiplicative scale was observed.ConclusionsAnalyses did not indicate substantial relationships between PM2.5 and TLBW or PTB, or effect measure modification by EHEs in this study."

 Roadside environments are critical interfaces where transportation systems intersect with urban ecosystems, often acting as hotspots for the accumulation of potentially toxic elements (PTEs). In arid and semi-arid regions with aged vehicle fleets and fuel quality concerns, the persistence and dispersion of PTEs pose heightened environmental and public health risks. This study aimed to investigate the spatial patterns, potential sources, and environmental drivers of PTE concentrations (Pb, Cd, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cr) in roadside soils west of Isfahan City, Iran. Surface (0–2 cm) and background (30 cm) soils were collected from 209 stations, and analyzed using standard protocols with detection limits ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 ppm. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) identified two dominant components: PC1 (Zn, Cu, Cr) related to mechanical abrasion, and PC2 (Pb, Cd, Ni) linked to combustion sources. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression and sensitivity analysis revealed that PC1 was primarily predicted by road slope and curvature, while PC2 was best explained by traffic volume and diesel vehicle proportion (R2 = 0.561 and 0.686, respectively). The results highlight the dual role of structural and operational road factors in shaping PTE distribution in dryland cities, with implications for land-use planning and pollution mitigation in rapidly urbanizing regions."

 This study investigates the inter-annual variability of carbonaceous aerosols (CA) over Kolkata, a megacity in eastern India, using dual carbon isotopes (14C and 13C) alongside measurements of the optical properties of brown carbon (BrC). Sampling was conducted during the post-monsoon, winter, and spring seasons over two consecutive years (2020–21 and 2021–22). The analysis reveals that PM2.5 and CA concentrations were higher in 2020–21 (194 ± 40 and 54 ± 15 μg m−3, respectively) compared to 2021–22 (141 ± 31 and 44 ± 21 μg m−3), likely due to higher precipitation in 2021–22. The contribution of biomass burning and biogenic sources to CA (fbio_TC) was slightly higher in 2020–21 (70 ± 3 %) than in 2021–22 (68 ± 3 %), with both years exhibiting a consistent decreasing trend from post-monsoon to spring. Observed lower values for oxidised CA proxies, such as the WSOC/OC ratio (0.41 ± 0.08) and AMS-derived f44 (0.13 ± 0.02), throughout the study period suggest that surface CA over Kolkata primarily originates from local sources rather than long-range transport. The relative radiative forcing (RRF) also showed a clear reduction in the subsequent year; however, on average, the RRF of methanol-soluble BrC (16 ± 6 %) was approximately three times higher than that of the water-soluble fraction (5.5 ± 2.2 %), highlighting the substantial role of BrC in influencing regional radiative forcing. These findings underscore the substantial impact of local emissions over transported pollutants on Kolkata's ground-level air quality."

 Despite considerable progress in air quality improvement, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution remains prevalent during the autumn and winter seasons in eastern Asian megacities: Beijing and Seoul. Here, we conducted synchronous field observations of PM2.5 chemical composition in Beijing and Seoul as part of the FRIEND Project, spanning the period from November 10th to December 10th, 2022 and we aimed to understand sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium (SNA) formation mechanism. The observations revealed that SNA, especially nitrate, were the primary contributor to particle matter pollution, accounting for 66 % and 76 % of PM2.5 in Beijing and Seoul, respectively, during pollution period (PM2.5>60 μg/m3). This indicated secondary inorganic aerosol formation was a key driver to force the urban fine particulate matter pollution in eastern Asian megacities. We found that the enhanced aerosol liquid water content (ALWC) during pollution episode facilitated SNA formation, then, contributing to the PM2.5 pollution. Such phenomenon was found in both cities. Aerosol acidity in Seoul was higher than that of in Beijing, leading to the different sulfate formation pathways. During observed pollution episode, liquid-phase sulfate was primarily formed through oxidation by transition metal ions (TMI) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in Beijing, while in Seoul, sulfate was mainly formed through TMI-catalyzed oxidation. Nitrate primarily existed in the particulate phase during pollution period with ambient relative humidity larger than 60 % in Beijing. In contrast, around 20 % of nitrate was still in the gas phase in Seoul due to low aerosol pH. The sensitivity analysis of particulate matter to precursors in both cities highlighted the needs for differentiated management strategies to reduce NOx and NH3 emissions under varying ALWC and pH conditions."

 Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) exists across a broad particle size range plays a crucial role in regional air pollution and climate, yet its formation mechanisms under varying meteorological conditions remain poorly understood. In this study, size-segregated aerosol samples (0.056–18 μm) were collected in Jiaxing, a coastal city in eastern China. Samples were categorized into land breeze (LP), sea breeze (SP), and dust event periods (DP). Oxygenated organic aerosols (OOAs) were identified as the dominant component of organic matters across all periods (65.9–81.6 %). Radiocarbon (14C) analysis revealed that fossil-derived OOA exhibited a dominant contribution to total OOC (78.1 %). High correlations of OOA and O3 in both fine and coarse modes indicated the important role of gas-phase oxidation across all particle sizes, while a specific association between fine-mode SOA and Fe ions suggested an additional aqueous-phase contribution in the fine mode. During the LP, the relative short transport distance of land air masses resulted in lower oxidation states for both fine and coarse particles, leading to the lowest O/C values. In contrast, during the SP, increased aerosol liquid water enhanced SOA formation, elevating O/C in coarse particles. During the DP, extensive multi-generational oxidation occurred during long-range transport, yielding higher fine-mode O/C. The coarse-mode OOA was positively correlated with Cl− and Ca2+, implying heterogeneous formation related to soil dusts. This study highlights the complexity of SOA formation pathways through multiple air mass types and different particle sizes, underscoring the necessity to incorporate various formation pathways into atmospheric models for accurate simulations and policy guidance."

Designed to account for geographical variability, this network enabled the first coordinated sampling campaigns for atmospheric mercury (Hg) data in ambient air and deposition. The resulting representative nationwide data, collected from 2020 to 2023, enabled the detection of seasonal, temporal, and spatial variations, which are analyzed in this study. Throughout the observational period, atmospheric Hg levels varied among the stations, exhibiting annual mean values between 1.22 ± 0.25 and 2.01 ±0.42ng/m3. A notable decrease in concentrations was evident in the northern and central regions. Conversely, the southern station maintained relatively stable levels, likely attributable to the predominant influence of natural sources. Ambient air Hg concentrations were examined for the impact of potential sources, with analysis conducted at both synoptic and local scales. Long-range transport pathways were identified using Potential Source Contributing Function (PSCF) analysis, while local investigations incorporated meteorological parameters, ozone measurements, and nearby fire hot-spot data.

 BackgroundParticulate matter (PM10/2.5) is a ubiquitous air pollutant with detrimental health impacts where fine particles (PM2.5) are posing serious threats to respiratory health. With potentially worse outcomes, it is silently damaging the lungs of people already suffering from respiratory diseases like asthma. The continuous exposures to poor air quality in recent years raises urgent questions for both, immediate and long-term health impacts. Both PM10/2.5 levels have surpassed the Indian National safety standards raising serious concerns about the environmental and health consequences.MethodologyThis study aimed to investigate impact of PM10/2.5 exposures on mice lungs where pathological changes in OVA-induced asthmatic mice lungs were compared with normal mice lungs. BALB/c mice were sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA, i.p), followed by OVA aerosol (1 %OVA) challenge, and later subjected to PM10/2.5 exposures (0.5 mg/kg, i.n) continuously for five consecutive days. Lung samples were assessed for oxidative stress markers (ROS and lipid peroxidation), inflammatory mediators (nitric oxide, histamine, myeloperoxidase, eosinophil peroxidase, IL-6), fibrotic markers (collagen deposition, MMP-9 activity, α-SMA expression), and histopathological changes. Dose-dependent cytotoxicity, oxidative stress induced DNA damage in human alveolar epithelial cells (A549) after PM10/2.5 exposures were thoroughly investigated. Curcumin derived from turmeric (Curcuma longa) is known anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory molecule, was studied for its therapeutic efficacy on PM-induced asthma aggravations and fibrotic changes.Key findingsSignificant lung damage was noted after short-term PM10/2.5 exposures (5 days) with aggravated inflammatory and fibrotic changes in both, normal and asthmatic mice lungs, where PM2.5 exposure was severe. Significant morphological and histopathological changes like lung tissue remodeling, epithelial thickening, and collagen deposition was observed. Enhanced immune cell recruitment, ROS and MDA levels along with significantly decreased key antioxidant enzymes, Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Catalase, compared to the control group were noted with reduced GSH level. Upregulated expression of NF-kB, a transcription factor after PM10/2.5 exposure was found in normal mice which was heightened in asthmatic mice. Enhanced MMP-9 activity was also confirmed by immunofluorescent detection of Alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Curcumin, a plant-derived molecule, significantly mitigated PM2.5 exposed airway inflammation and fibrotic changes in lungs by suppressing NF-κB expression and enhancing Nrf2 level. In vitro studies validated these findings, where dose-dependent decrease in cell viability and increased in ROS level along with apoptotic changes A549 cells were observed after PM exposure. Enhanced IL-6 and PARP-1 expression confirmed progressive PM2.5 exposure induced cytotoxicity in A549 cells which was reduced after curcumin treatment.SignificanceThese findings draw the attention towards detrimental impacts of poor air quality of Varanasi city with genotoxic effects which have not been reported before. Therapeutic potential of Curcumin as a natural protective agent against PM-induced respiratory damage revealed antioxidant-based interventions. It may be alarming for residents living in such polluted environments, particularly susceptible asthmatic population where silent pathological changes are in progress, thus, more detailed investigations are required along with improved air quality management policies in polluted urban areas in near future."

Elemental carbon (EC) levels were 10.61 (±2.24) μg/m3, 9.88 (±1.30) μg/m3, and 8. 58(±0.77) μg/m3 in C1, C2, and C3 respectively. Secondary organic carbon (SOC) was found to be less prevalent than primary organic carbon (POC) in all the canteens. Overall, PM2.5 compositions were dominated by organics (>40 %) followed by elements and ions, though relative proportions varied significantly. Water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) constituted over 60 % of OC in the canteens and 50 % in the outdoor location. Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) analysis showed 8–9 times higher N/C ratios in the canteens compared to outdoor environments. Organic aerosol evolution also showed stark differences between canteens and outdoor environments. Elemental analysis revealed significant concentrations of toxic and carcinogenic elements in canteens. The total respiratory deposited dose (TRDD) was found to be approximately 3 times higher in C1, 2 times higher in C2, and 1.5 times higher in C3 compared to the outdoor location. This comprehensive study of indoor particulate matter in canteens provides novel and crucial insights into air quality and potential health implications in these unique microenvironments."

 While several studies have compared the performance of statistical and dispersion modelling methods for air pollution, none have done so for pollen.We developed a statistical machine learning model for daily pollen concentrations of five highly allergenic pollen types (hazel, alder, birch, ash, and grasses) across Switzerland (2000–2023). Daily average predictions for grass, alder and birch pollen were available for 2017–2023 from the COSMO-ART dispersion model, the operational forecast model at the Swiss Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology. In this study, we have compared estimated concentrations for overlapping pollen types and years at three levels: (1) pollen measurement stations, (2) a 1 × 1 km national grid, and (3) residential addresses of the Swiss National Cohort.At the grid and cohort address levels, statistical and dispersion models showed a strong correlation for grass (0.75) and birch (0.70) pollen and a moderate correlation for alder pollen (0.41). Cross-validated Pearson's correlations between statistically modelled and measured pollen concentrations ranged from 0.80 (alder), 0.85 (birch) to 0.86 (grass), with root-mean-squared logarithmic error (RMSLE) values of 0.33, 0.31 and 0.35, respectively. Pearson correlations between COSMO-ART predictions and measured concentrations were 0.41 (alder), 0.75 (birch) and 0.63 (grass), with the highest RMSLE of 0.88 for alder pollen, while RMSLEs of grass and birch models were 0.63 and 0.67, respectively.Statistical models showed higher agreement with measured pollen concentrations at stations than COSMO-ART for all pollen types.

 Dusty weather (including dust storms, blowing dust and floating dust) represents a catastrophic weather phenomenon with extensive adverse environmental impacts. However, its natural variability and underlying mechanisms at the global scale remain insufficiently explored in prior research. This study investigates the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics and driving mechanism of global dusty weather using long-term station observations and reanalysis data. Our findings reveal a significant declining trend in dusty weather over the Taklimakan Desert and southwestern Sahara Desert from 1979 to 2023, whereas an increasing trend is observed over the northern Sahara Desert, Arabian Desert and Gobi Desert during the same period. Temporally, global dusty weather activity exhibits a decline from 1979 to 1999, followed by an interdecadal-scale oscillation with cycles of 10–14 years after 1999. The mechanistic analysis demonstrates that Atlantic climate modes—particularly the South Atlantic Subtropical Dipole (SASD) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)—play a dominant role in modulating the interdecadal variability of dust storms, with correlation coefficients of −0.44 (SASD) and 0.37 (NAO), respectively. Consequently, energy convergence over dust source regions, modulated by the SASD and NAO, stimulates low-pressure troughs and intensified westerlies in the Northern Hemisphere, alongside warm high-pressure systems in the Southern Hemisphere, both of which enhance dust storms. Our results advance the understanding of global dusty weather dynamics and offer valuable insights for future dust storms prediction."

 Carbonyl compounds play a significant role in atmospheric chemistry, leading to the formation of ozone and secondary organic aerosols. Emissions of carbonyl compounds from construction machinery cannot be ignored. In this study, a total of 37 units of in-use construction machinery were tested using portable emission measurement system under real-world operating conditions. Carbonyl compounds were collected using the O-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl) hydroxylamine derivatization method and analyzed via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The composite carbonyl compound emission factors of excavators, forklifts, loaders, road rollers, pile engines and graders were 3.30 ± 1.45 g/kg-fuel, 2.05 ± 0.97 g/kg-fuel, 3.20 ± 1.18 g/kg-fuel, 2.69 ± 1.02 g/kg-fuel, 5.55 ± 2.26 g/kg-fuel and 2.94 ± 1.31 g/kg-fuel, respectively. Pile engines exhibited the highest emission factors during working, whereas the others had the highest emission factors while idling. In addition, the continuous tightening of emission standards has effectively reduced the emissions of carbonyl compounds from construction machinery. The total emissions of carbonyl compounds from five typical construction machinery in China in 2019 were estimated to be 12.1 kt, with corresponding ozone formation potential (OFP) and secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOAFP) of 82.5 kt and 360.1 t, respectively. Acetaldehyde and formaldehyde were the primary contributors to the total emissions and OFP, while benzaldehyde was the largest contributor to the SOAFP. The contributions of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to total emissions of carbonyl compounds and their corresponding OFP and SOA were much higher than those of other provinces. Our results supplement the limited emission factor data for carbonyl compounds from construction machinery and can aid in improving emission inventories and developing targeted control strategies to enhance air quality."

 The oxidation potential (OP) of PM2.5 increased the prevalence of respiratory and pulmonary diseases of human health. In this study, high-time-resolution sampling was conducted in summer and winter in Xi'an, and the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay was employed to quantify PM2.5 OP. The results showed that winter PM2.5 OP was more twice than summer, and nighttime OP was higher than daytime both in summer and winter. In summer, the mass-normalized DTT consumption rate (DTTm) exhibited two peaks at 4:00–8:00 and 12:00–16:00. In winter, high DTTm appeared during the nighttime periods (20:00–4:00). Functional group revealed that peak areas of R-ONO2, aromatic C=C, and C=O from ketones, quinones and amides had consistent trends with DTT values in summer, confirmed that nitrogenous organic aerosols enhanced the oxidative activity. While on winter night, the high peak areas of O-H, aliphatic C-H, polysaccharide C-O, and deformation of aromatic C-H coincided with DTTm variation, inferred these function groups had an important effect on OP.

 Understanding the impact of air pollution on aortic diseases such as aortic dissection (AD) and aortic aneurysm (AA) is crucial given their high morbidity and mortality rates. This study leverages Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore the causal relationships between various air pollutants and the risk of developing AD and AA. Utilizing genetic variants as instrumental variables from comprehensive genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we conducted both univariate and multivariable MR analyses. Our findings indicate a significant positive association between increased exposure to PM2.5 and an elevated risk of AD. Conversely, other investigated relationships did not show significant causal effects. These results underscore the critical need for public health interventions and policies aimed at reducing exposure to air pollutants to prevent serious aortic conditions.

 Concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), such as poultry farms, contribute significantly to air pollution, particularly ammonia (NH3) and particulate matter (PM) emissions. Vegetative environmental buffers (VEBs) offer a sustainable, cost-effective, and low-maintenance solution for mitigating NH3 and PM emissions from CAFOs, and some previous studies showed that pollutant concentrations behind the VEBs were substantially reduced compared with concentration directly from the source. However, due to the lack of a controlled dataset for non-VEB situations, the net effect of VEBs could hardly be assessed. Thus, the dataset from the previous study was used to develop a methodology for quantitatively evaluating the efficacy of VEBs in reducing NH3 and PM emissions from a poultry house, and to distinguish the net pollutant reduction achieved by VEBs from those resulting merely from atmospheric dilution and dispersion. The results showed that VEB can effectively mitigate air pollutants emissions and attributes enhanced ground-level reductions of NH3 (72.7 % ± 9.1 %), total suspended particle (TSP) (61.9 % ± 10.0 %), PM10 (62.5 % ± 9.9 %) and PM2.5 (94.6 % ± 6.5 %). In addition, VEB demonstrated better mitigation performance during daytime. Meteorological conditions showed no correlation with pollutant concentrations or enhanced reduction ratios while significant positive correlations between reductions of NH3 and PM were also observed. These results demonstrated that VEBs are effective in reducing NH3 and PM emissions from poultry houses. The results from this study will inform conservation practice guidelines and assist land managers in employing VEBs for poultry house emitted air pollution reductions."

 The Alsace region in northeastern France frequently experiences autumnal and winter radiation fog, which significantly affects air quality through the accumulation and transformation of atmospheric pollutants. Despite numerous studies on either fog chemistry or particulate matter (PM) in Strasbourg, no prior research has simultaneously examined the interactions between fog and PM in this region. This study presents a comprehensive investigation of fog and PM samples collected in Strasbourg and the nearby suburb of Geispolsheim in fall 2016, focusing on carbonaceous components (organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC)) and their stable carbon isotopic composition (δ13CTC). Fog water was analyzed for pH, conductivity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), δ13CTC, and major ions, while PM2.5 and PM10 samples were analyzed for OC, EC, total carbon (TC), and δ13CTC. Results reveal significant changes in fog chemistry since the 1990s, including elevated pH and reduced sulfate and nitrate concentrations. Moderate scavenging of OC and negligible EC scavenging occurred in Strasbourg, while Geispolsheim exhibited higher EC scavenging, potentially due to aerosol aging during regional transport. Fog and rain events were found to selectively remove isotopically enriched carbon, resulting in δ13CTC depletion of interstitial PM. This depletion may reflect size-dependent scavenging or removal of carbonate-enriched coarse particles. Comparisons with datasets from California and the Po Valley suggest that differences in fuel usage—particularly diesel prevalence in France—affect δ13CTC signatures. This study offers new insights into fog–aerosol interactions in urban environments and represents the first isotopic characterization of PM and fog in Strasbourg. Future work should focus on particle size distribution, carbonate content, and source apportionment to refine understanding of scavenging processes and carbon isotope fractionation in fog-influenced air masses."

 Ketones, which are generated during the oxidation of hydrocarbon fuels and oxygenated derivatives, are promising candidates as biofuel materials and reactive intermediates. In this study, the temperature-dependent rate coefficients for the reactions of the simplest Criegee intermediate (CH2OO) with acetone (CH3COCH3, Ac) and methyl ethyl ketone (CH3COC2H5, MEK) were quantified through flash photolysis coupled with OH laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection. Experimental measurements were conducted over a temperature range of 283–318 K and a pressure range of 5–200 Torr revealed distinct kinetic behaviors.

The kinetics of this reaction were temperature-dependent, with Arrhenius analysis, revealing an activation energy of (4.59 ± 0.36) kcal mol−1.

 Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) is known for its substantial isoprene emissions, which can contribute to air pollution and climate change. As oil palm plantations expand across Southeast Asia, developing effective mitigation strategies such as propagating low-isoprene-emitting variants of this species is essential. To this end, we measured the isoprene emissions from oil palm saplings grown from seeds and clonally propagated under controlled environmental conditions in an E. guineensis nursery in Sessang, Malaysia. The effects of the leaf position, time of day, root conditions, and growth stage were examined for further data quality control. The first set of results showed that isoprene emissions varied more widely in seed-derived saplings (mean: 13.6 ± 5.2 nmol m−2 s−1) than in clonal saplings (mean: 18.6 ± 2.9 nmol m−2 s−1), with the latter exhibiting consistently higher emissions. Further investigation of the potential influencing factors revealed that isoprene emission rates varied with leaf position, with the upper and middle fronds producing more isoprene than lower fronds. Additionally, the emissions exhibited clear peaks in the morning or midday. Older trees exhibited significantly higher isoprene emission rates (26.32 ± 6.49 nmol m−2 s−1) than saplings, suggesting that the emissions change with growth stage. Based on these findings, we recommended that isoprene emission measurements be taken from the middle or upper leaves in the morning or at midday to ensure a reliable comparison. The substantial intraspecific variability in isoprene emission among E. guineensis saplings from crossbreeding highlights the potential for identifying and selecting low-emission variants."

 The higher particulate matter (PM) level in Delhi presents a significant health hazard, emphasizing the need for innovative metrics that precisely capture its potential health impacts. This study investigates oxidative potential (OP) as a health-relevant metric. OP showed a significant variability across particle sizes (PM1, PM2.5 and PM10) and their sources. Notably, OPv (volume normalized) surpassed OPm (mass normalized), suggesting a strong correlation of OP with aerosol composition and their sources (R2 > 0.6–0.76). The hazard index (HI) was notably higher for fine particles (PM1, PM2.5: 3.48 ± 2.09–9.28 ± 5.58) compared to PM10 (2.27 ± 1.01–5.05 ± 2.24). Chemical analysis of non-refractory PM1 revealed organic aerosols as the predominant constituents, followed by nitrate (NO3−) and sulfate (SO42−), while chloride (Cl−) being the least abundant. The elevated NO3− levels were attributed to the oxidation of SO42− in ammonium-rich environments, supported by sulfur oxidation ratio (SOR) and nitrogen oxidation ratio (NOR). Primary organic carbon (POC) significantly exceeded (2–4 times) secondary organic carbon (SOC) and charred elemental carbon (Char-EC) being more abundant in PM2.5 than soot-derived elemental carbon (Soot-EC), insightful for combustion processes. A comparison of OP with the Air Quality Index (AQI) and HI revealed that days categorized as having satisfactory air quality exhibited unexpectedly high both OP, comparable to days classified as very poor/severe AQI. This suggests that OP is an independent parameter influenced by various factors, including exposure level, chemical composition, inhalation rates, and aerosol characteristics. The OPv demonstrated significant correlations with measured parameters (R2: 0.54–0.86), particularly with primary aerosols (R2: 0.68–0.76), while showing weaker correlations with secondary aerosols (R2: 0.32–0.52). In contrast, OPm exhibited negative correlations (R2: −0.11 to −0.50), likely due to chemical species which generates reactive oxygen species (ROS).

 Identifying the roles of specific atmospheric volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is crucial for effective ozone (O3) control. The maximum reactivity incremental (MIR) value is a widely used reactivity scale for calculating ozone formation potential (OFP) of VOCs. In this study, we determined localized MIR values for 44 non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) using a box model based on seven observation datasets from five cities in three regions of China. We then examined the variability of these MIR values, identified potential influencing factors, and discussed their implications for O3 control strategies. The MIR values exhibited strong correlations across all seven observations (r = 0.98–0.99), with C4–C5 internal alkenes showing the highest MIR values (22.5–87.1 μg O3 μg−1). Nonetheless, substantial variability of MIR values existed across different observations, as ratios relative to the Beijing 2016 observation of 0.6–1.45. Potential causes for the observed MIR variability included variations in photolysis rate and the fraction of reactive NMHCs across different observations, as well as the treatment of carbonyls in MIR calculations. Compared to values derived under U.S. atmospheric conditions, our calculated MIR values for internal alkenes were higher, while those for low-reactivity species were lower, suggesting a broader range of MIR values for various NMHCs in this study. While OFP values calculated with our localized MIR values generally correlated well with those using U.S. MIR values in six observations, applying U.S. MIR values to assess OFP in China might overestimate alkane contributions and underestimate those of alkenes (especially isoprene and C4–C5 anthropogenic alkenes) to O3 formation. These findings underscore the importance of utilizing region-specific MIR values for the accurate identification of key O3 precursors and the implementation of effective regulatory measures."

 Toluene and α-pinene are typical anthropogenic and biogenic volatile organic compounds, respectively, which can contribute to urban fine particles through photochemical processes. However, there is still a lack of understanding of the formation and composition of SOA and possible interactions in mixed toluene-α-pinene systems. A high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometer was used to determine the composition of SOA in the toluene-α-pinene mixed system. The results showed that the α-pinene-O3 channel was dominant in forming SOA from mixed system. Since α-pinene has a higher rate constant with OH radical than toluene, the consumption of toluene was reduced by 35 % due to competition from α-pinene. New products were found in mixed system based on SOA mass spectra, and the signal fraction of C15 ∼ 20 oligomers (3.7 ± 0.6 %) was higher than that of individual toluene system (0.7 ± 0.1 %) and individual α-pinene system (1.6 ± 0.2 %); The range of H/C and O/C ratios of SOA molecules from mixed system was similar to the individual α-pinene system, further show that the mixed SOA mainly from O3 channel oxidation of α-pinene. The average Carbon Oxidation State (OSC) of the mixed system is −0.2, lying between the individual toluene system (0.2) and individual α-pinene system (−0.3), which approaches the α-pinene system.

 Ice core records from the Tibetan Plateau (TP) provide regional indicators of climatic and environmental changes and permit reconstruction of variations in human-made atmospheric pollutants during past hundreds of years. To comprehensively understand the TP's climate and environment history, we addressed the past climate and environmental changes reconstructed by ice core evidences, focusing on the variations of anthropogenic pollutants (e.g., mercury, black carbon). Since the 1980s, more than 40 ice cores across the TP have been drilled and some of them are investigated. Key benchmarker layers within the TP ice cores, such as peak values of ß-activity and tritium in 1963 AD, provide effective means for precise dating. The TP ice core reconstructions revealed the recent warming from the 1900s with different warming rate on the southern or northern TP, which were also affected by the large-scale atmospheric circulations. Emissions of human-related pollutants have seriously affected and altered Earth's environment and shown an increasing trend in the TP ice cores, especially since the 1950s. These existed variability of the reconstructions among ice cores in different TP regions was mainly controlled by interactions between the South Asian monsoon and westerly intensity. We also discussed the uncertainties of TP ice core dating currently, highlighting the recent rapid climate warming is threatening ice core archives. In the future, new techniques for dating and chemical analysis should be explored and more ice core archives should be obtained for the next generation."

 The Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) plays crucial role in regulating the land-atmosphere interactions and the accurate estimation of its height (BLH) plays vital role in different meteorological applications. This study evaluates the performance and reliability of ERA-5 reanalysis dataset in estimating the BLH against the radiosonde derived BLH across 24 different stations in India during the period 2006 to 2020. The BLH from radiosondes was derived using multiple methods, with the Potential Temperature Gradient method (PT) showing the best agreement with ERA-5 estimates. Results indicate that ERA-5 generally underestimates the BLH, with a bias ranging between ∼0.2 to 0.5 km and regional correlation values from ∼0.32 to 0.81. Our analysis also revealed pronounced seasonal biases across different regions with largest discrepancies occurring during the Northeast Monsoon (NEM), followed by the Southwest Monsoon (SWM), summer (SUM), and winter. The influence and the relative contribution of the surface drivers on the BLH across different regions are investigated. Our analysis revealed that the thermal and moisture related factors have greater influence on the BLH over dry arid regions like NW and wet regions (NE) respectively. Seasonal and regional analysis reveals deeper ABL's during the pre-monsoon season with values ranging from ∼1.2 to ∼3.2 km and shallower ABL's registered during the winter season with values ranges from ∼0.5 to ∼1.4 km. Additionally, Central India (CI) and Northwest India (South India (SI) and Northeast India (NEI)) recorded deeper (shallower) ABL's during the study period. Trend results suggest that, the SI and NWI show positive increasing trend with values ranging between 0.12 and 3 m/year during the study period, whilst the CI and NI show negative decreasing trend of approximately −0.13-1.2 m/year. These findings affirm the utility of ERA-5 for ABL studies over India, while emphasizing the need for regional bias corrections and further exploration of land–atmosphere feedbacks."

 Using observational and reanalysis data, this study investigates the severe winter drought event in Eastern China during 2024/25, which is the most extreme in at least four decades. The event featured a record-low Eastern China winter precipitation (ECWP) of 36.24 mm, with over 80 % precipitation deficits in multiple Eastern China regions and numerous stations recording their lowest/second/third-lowest winter precipitation, 39 consecutive days of nearly no measurable precipitation. Statistical analysis and dynamic diagnostics reveal that the ECWP is synergistically influenced by the Indo-Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) and Tibetan Plateau (TP) thermal conditions. The Equatorial-North Pacific (ENP) and Indian Ocean SSTs modulate the ECWP by affecting circulation to regulate moisture transport from the South China Sea and the Bay of Bengal to Eastern China, respectively. The TP thermal effect exerts its effects through cold (warm) temperatures inducing an anomalous cyclone (anticyclone) near the TP, which enhance (suppress) moisture transport to Eastern China and thereby increase (reduce) the ECWP. During the winter of 2024/25, both the Indo-Pacific SST and TP thermal conditions were unfavorable for the ECWP.

 Understanding the evolution of temperature extremes under global warming is crucial for effective regional climate adaptation. In South Korea—a region undergoing rapid urbanization and facing rising heat-related risks—there is a growing need to better understand these changes, particularly in relation to global climate drivers. To meet this need, this study employs a non-stationary Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) model that incorporates global mean surface temperature (GMST) as a covariate. Daily maximum and minimum temperatures from 60 nationwide weather stations were analyzed, focusing on summer and winter extremes over durations ranging from 1 to 15 days during the period 1974–2023.The results reveal distinct regional and seasonal patterns of non-stationarity. Winter extremes have become milder, with broader temperature distributions and fewer cold events, indicating a weakening of cold spells. However, in terms of adverse societal and environmental impacts, summer extremes are more vulnerable. Tropical night events exhibit the greatest sensitivity to global warming, particularly along the west and south coasts, where their frequency and persistence have increased sharply. Heatwaves have also intensified, though less dramatically. These changes appear linked to large-scale climate dynamics, including intensification of the North Pacific Subtropical High and warming of surrounding seas, which enhance atmospheric moisture transport toward the Korean Peninsula. By integrating observational data with a dynamic statistical framework, this study provides new insights into the changing nature of temperature extremes and their drivers—offering a valuable basis for targeted adaptation strategies in South Korea."

 A robust and trustworthy rainfall projection over the Indian landmass is vital for devising climate adaptation strategies. However, past studies show large inter-model spread in Indian Summer monsoon (ISM) rainfall projections thus calling for more detailed investigations on the underlying process. In the present study, we investigate this aspect using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) model projections (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, SSP5–8.5) and historical simulations. The Multi-Model Ensemble mean (MME) results show intensification of ISM rainfall at the end of the 21st century with ISM rainfall increasing by 1.6 ± 0.8 mm/day under SSP5–8.5 scenario. A moisture budget analysis for the MME further infers that the thermodynamic effect (TH) due to global warming plays a dominant role in enhancing ISM rainfall in the projections, with its dynamic counterpart (DY) assuming an additional contribution. It is also revealed that both DY and TH terms contribute to the inter-model uncertainty in ISM rainfall, but with DY dominating over the other this time. The inter-model uncertainty in DY and ISM rainfall changes is linked to inter-model spread in interhemispheric thermal contrast which in-turn depends on the diversity in Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) and Global Mean Temperature (GMT) among the models. Intriguingly, when we remove the inter-model diversity in ECS through a GMT scaling, an Atlantic meridional surface temperature gradient, involving both land and ocean, emerges as a crucial driver in controlling the uncertainty in both DY and ISM rainfall changes, and drives large-scale monsoon circulation changes over African and the Indian subcontinents."

 This study evaluates the simulation capabilities of 11 CMIP6 global climate models for hydrological cycle components in Northwest China (NWC) during 1995–2014, utilizing ERA5 reanalysis data for validation. Results demonstrate that the CMIP6 ensemble effectively captures spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation, precipitation recycling ratio (ρ), and internal/external cycling precipitation. Subsequent analysis compares projected hydrological changes under SSP1–2.6 (low-emission) and SSP5–8.5 (high-emission) scenarios (2021−2100) against the historical baseline. The findings suggest that NWC is projected to experience a wetter climate in the future, with precipitation increase rates of 0.52 % per decade under the SSP1–2.6 and 3.12 % per decade under the SSP5–8.5. The most rapid intensification occurs in the early 21st century (2021–2040), followed by mid-21st century (2041–2060) deceleration in the growth rate. By the end of the century (2081–2100), precipitation declines under SSP1–2.6 but resurges under SSPP5–8.5, with maximum moistening concentrated in central NWC. Regarding the precipitation recycling rate (ρ), the overall rate in NWC is projected to fluctuate within ±5 % under the SSP1–2.6. In contrast, it is expected to exhibit a fluctuating downward trend under the SSP5–8.5, decreasing by 1.04 % per decade and reaching nearly 5.1 % lower than the baseline period by the end of the 21st century. This indicates progressive weakening of internal cycling under high emissions. Spatially, the distribution of ρ is highly uneven. The internal cycle is expected to increase significantly in the central region of NWC due to the abnormal enhancement of evaporation, while it will gradually weaken over time in other regions. Future precipitation increases primarily derive from the combined effects of internal and external cycling, but is primarily driven by changes in external cycling precipitation (Po) through enhanced moisture transport. Moreover, under the high emission scenario, the contribution from external cycling demonstrates progressive increase, while internal cycling exhibits gradually weaken. This suggests that as climate warming accelerates in NWC, the rapid ablation of glaciers and snowmelt may lead to a transition from strengthening to weakening of the internal cycle because of the increasing ineffective evaporation. Even if the absolute precipitation increases in the future, the additional moisture may be offset by ineffective evaporation, making it difficult to convert into usable water resources. This poses a severe challenge for future water resource management in NWC."

 Based on the Climate Research Unit (CRU) monthly rainfall data and the NationalCenters for Environment Prediction (NCEP)/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) reanalysis atmospheric circulation data during 1961–2020, we examine the interdecadal change in the relationship between the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and summer rainfall in northern Central Asia (CA). Results show that the NAO negatively (positively) correlates with summer rainfall in northern CA during 1969–1989 (1990–2010), but it becomes obviously closer in the second period, indicating their relationship has experienced a significant interdecadal change over the past 60 years. The varying relationship between the NAO and summer rainfall in northern CA is caused by the interdecadal change in the NAO-related large-scale circulation anomalies. The positive NAOI is well related to the strengthening subtropical westerly jet over CA, an anomalous cyclone over west of CA and southerly wind prevailing over northern CA and convergences of water vapor occupying the whole northern CA, so the relationship between the NAO and summer rainfall in northern CA has become stronger during 1990–2010. Furthermore analysis suggests that the intensity of subtropical westerly jet over CA plays an important role in linking the NAO and summer rainfall in northern CA. In the first period, the atmospheric teleconnection pattern triggered by the NAO only has weak effects on the subtropical westerly jet over CA, but in the second period it can strongly modulate the change in the intensity of subtropical westerly jet over CA."

 Heat waves (HWs) are complex, multivariate, extreme weather events that cause significant harm to human health, ecosystems, and economies. Correct detection and attribution of HWs to anthropogenic climate change is important to better understand the underlying mechanisms and to improve predictions. In this work, we address this issue and propose a multivariate version of a hybrid approach to reconstruct heat waves, consisting of the AM and deep Autoencoders (MvEA-AM algorithm), improving existing less effective methods used until now, such as the multivariate Analogue Method (MvAM). The proposed hybrid approach produces a more reliable representation of the event than the classical MvAM for reconstructing and attributing HWs in Europe. The explainable and interpretable analysis of the obtained results is based on leveraging the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to explain deep learning algorithms, a capability that is not achievable with the MvAM.

 This study employs the WRF-based RMAPS-ST numerical weather prediction model to conduct 1-km resolution simulations of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games on February 2022. An inter-comparison of the SH, the SMS and the IUM scale-aware PBL schemes is conducted. The performance of YSU as a traditional PBL scheme is also evaluated as a baseline. The investigation focuses on their ability to forecast over three distinct competition areas, Beijing (BJ), Yanqing (YQ), and Zhangjiakou (ZJK), each characterized by different terrain. The results reveal that the IUM and SMS schemes generally outperform the YSU and the SH schemes, particularly in the BJ area, where IUM exhibits the lowest root-mean-square error (RMSE) for 2-m temperature and 10-m wind speed. In YQ, with its complex topography, there are no significant discrepancies among the schemes, while SMS improves wind speed forecasts in ZJK. An abrupt nocturnal warming and a gusty wind case are chosen to further demonstrate the performance in all schemes. Results show that IUM scheme can reproduce these two cases, attributed to its stronger turbulence mixing length. These findings underscore the importance of scale-aware PBL schemes in improving high-resolution weather forecasts and diverse meteorological conditions. The IUM scheme, in particular, emerges as a promising tool for future numerical weather prediction applications."

 As a strong upper-tropospheric easterly jet stream over the Afro-Australian monsoon region, the tropical easterly jet (TEJ) originates from the meridional thermal contrast between the Asian landmass, the Tibetan Plateau (TP) in particular, and the tropical Indian Ocean in boreal summer. Here, we find that the atmospheric heat source anomaly over the southeastern TP can induce an opposite response of the upper-tropospheric zonal wind over the western Pacific, where the TEJ usually inflows and manifests as the double easterly jets. Positive TP heating anomaly could accelerate the northern branch of double easterly jets and decelerate the southern one, and vice versa. Two pathways linking the TP heating and the TEJ are proposed. First, positive heat forcing over the southeastern TP can directly induce the easterly responses over the South Asia by the thermal wind which is mainly determined by the changed meridional temperature gradient. The associated easterly response significantly accelerates the northern part of the TEJ. The other pathway suggests that the TP heating will indirectly modulate the southern branch of double easterly jets by changing the thermal condition over the western North Pacific (WNP). The negative WNP heat anomaly exerts a pair of upper-level cyclones straddling the equator with anomalous westerly in between, primarily decelerating the south branch of the double easterly jets over the Maritime Continent. Our findings suggest the TP heating anomaly significantly influences the upper-tropospheric TEJ, especially the double jets in its inflow region, advancing understanding of the TEJ variability and the Asian summer monsoon dynamics."

 Data merging is widely applied to improve large-scale precipitation estimates. However, traditional merging algorithms rely heavily on gauge observations and suffer from increased uncertainties in data-sparse regions. Statistical uncertainty analysis (SUA) offers a potential solution by estimating merging weights analytically and thereby reducing dependence on gauge data. However, the comparative effectiveness of SUA-merged and traditional gauge-merged precipitation datasets remains unclear, largely due to the scarcity of truly independent validation data. Here, using 268 wholly independent rain gauges, we show that SUA-based merging can effectively suppress random errors and outperform remote sensing and reanalysis products. Notably, compared to traditional gauge-merged datasets, SUA-merged precipitation demonstrates averagely stronger correlation with independent observations and lower root-mean-square errors. These results provide direct evidence for the ability of SUA to mitigate reliance on gauge data, especially in observation-scarce regions. However, SUA-merged products still show limitations with regards to accurately classifying rain/no-rain events, highlighting the need for future enhancements targeting false precipitation detection."

 Pre-existing tropical disturbances often serve as a precursor to tropical cyclone (TC) formation. However, a very small percentage of these disturbances turn up as TCs, depending on the environmental conditions. Disturbances that remain non-developed throughout their lifespan have very similar characteristics to the disturbances that develop as a TC. Therefore, it is important to comprehend the environmental factors responsible for transforming tropical disturbances into tropical cyclones. In this study, we analyzed the environmental conditions surrounding the disturbance vortex, as well as the structural evolution of the vortices during the pre-genesis stage, for two non-developing and two developing disturbances (which later evolved into different categories) over the Bay of Bengal. The analysis was conducted using output data from the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting model, blackbody temperature observations from INSAT-3D, and daily Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature analysis data. All the disturbances processed over the Indian Ocean warm pool region where the sea surface temperature (SST) was above the threshold of TC genesis. However, the SST anomaly was negative ahead of the non-developing disturbance and positive for the developing disturbances. The main characteristics of the developing disturbances that differed from the non-developing disturbance are the upright structure of the vortex with undistorted vortex core from the dry air intrusion, larger area coverage of cold cloud top with persistent cyclonically spiral cloud bands centred at the vortex core, and the extension of the strong ascending region over time. The intensity of low-level vorticity was unable to identify the developing potential of the disturbances. The synchronous incremental variation of the kinetic energy density of primary and secondary circulations and the vertical helicity in the developing disturbances was helpful for their sustainability."

 Regional convection-permitting meteorological reanalyses substantially improve the atmospheric representation compared to convection-parameterized counterparts. This holds particularly for multi-scale driven variables such as precipitation in terms of spatial structures, intensity and frequency rates, or the timing and peak of its summer diurnal cycle. However, the simulation of convective-related phenomena is highly model-dependent, implying the inability to sample the full range of natural variability with single-model experiments. This challenge is exacerbated for km-scale simulations owing to the intrinsic chaotic nature underlying convection. Multi-model ensembles of high-resolution climate models demonstrate to reduce the simulation errors associated with individual model outputs over Europe. When applied to retrospective estimates, such ensemble approach could then offer a comprehensive, homogeneous, and optimized assessment of past atmospheric states.This study presents the first multi-model ensemble of regional reanalyses over Italy considering four recently produced datasets to assess the added value of their joint use. These products are derived by dynamically downscaling the global reanalysis ERA5 with different numerical models: MERIDA_HRES, MOLOCH, SPHERA and VHR-REA_IT. The reference dataset for comparison is the pluviometer-based hourly analysis GRIPHO. The investigation over 2007–2016 includes the annual and seasonal variations in daily and hourly mean rainfall intensity and frequency, heavy precipitation occurrences, and their summer diurnal cycles. No single dataset systematically outperforms the others, and substantial inter-model variability is detected for summer precipitation. The ensemble improves rainfall statistical estimates compared to individual reanalyses by providing more realistic spatial patterns, enhanced skill, and reduced biases relative to observations. These findings have potential implications for downstream reanalysis applications."

 By pinpointing the temporal and spatial key zone where hail precipitation instantaneously responds to cloud condensation nuclei concentration (CCNC) explosions, this study offers significant advancements in understanding CCNC-cloud-hail interactions and the potential for artificial hail suppression. An idealized hailstorm was simulated using high-resolving (500 m) across a comprehensive ensemble comprising 151 runs. This simulation incorporated five distinct time points from convective initiation to hail formation. It encompassed six vertical zones of initial CCNC. Five categories of CCNC explosions between 700 cm−3 and 70,000 cm−3 were considered. The results indicate that the value of the minimum hail precipitation rate is from below 10 % to 45 % of control member with convection development. At the initial time point, hail precipitation rate exhibits a non-monotonic response to CCN concentration, first decreases and then increases. Raindrops' formation (10 and 15 min) shifts the inflexion point. Hail formation (20 min) causes the response to first increase and then decrease. The small cloud droplets from CCNC explosions impede raindrop formation (suppressing hail precipitation, dominant at low CCNC) and promote raindrop growth (enhancing hail precipitation, dominant at high CCNC). As convection develops, the key zone for the response of hail precipitation to CCNC explosions rises from the atmospheric boundary layer region to the 0 °C layer. This increase is due to changes in the critical region of microphysical processes at different time points. The CCNC explosion in the key zone causes smaller cloud droplets, rise rapidly to exceed the critical region, and inhibit its collection by hail particles."

 Reanalysis datasets are essential substitutes for direct observations and play a critical role in weather and climate research. However, the resolution of existing reanalysis over China is too coarse to capture mesoscale atmospheric phenomena and climatic extreme events. To address this limitation, a convection-permitting (CP; resolution ≤4 km) regional reanalysis product over China is necessary. To verify the feasibility of constructing a CP regional reanalysis, this study conducts a CP regional reanalysis experiment over China with the spectral nudging technique (SN). The results reveal that the application of SN can enhance the capability in the reproduction of spatiotemporal precipitation characteristics, regional precipitation features, and Meiyu period precipitation dynamics compared to classical dynamical downscaling. Diagnostic analysis reveals that SN aligns geopotential height at 500 hPa with ERA5 (daily spatial correlations >0.96) and weakens excessive vertically integrated moisture flux convergence in classical dynamical downscaling by >0.2 g/(m2 s), explaining the statistical gains. Furthermore, the CP regional reanalysis outperforms the global reanalysis ERA5 in reproducing regional precipitation and extreme precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau. It also excels in representing the characteristics of mesoscale convective system and their associated diurnal cycles during the Meiyu period. These findings highlight the potential of SN in constructing high-resolution reanalysis datasets and underscore its value for developing a long-term CP regional reanalysis product over China."
