10.1088/1748-9326/ad6e08,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究主要关注长江三角洲地区的碳汇变化，利用植被模型和土地覆盖变化数据模拟了该地区1990-2019年的碳动态。研究发现，森林扩张对碳汇的增强有显著贡献，但其他植被类型的损失也会释放碳，因此需要采取措施防止新造林区域成为碳源。该研究没有涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析。,"['carbon sink', 'afforestation', 'vegetation model', 'land cover change']",Yuan Zhao;Xu Yue;Hao Zhou;Zhen Yu;Wenping Yuan,"The effect of afforestation on a regional carbon sink: a case study in the Yangtze River Delta, China","As one of the most densely populated and economically developed regions in China, Yangtze River Delta (YRD) has confronted with substantial land cover change (LCC) over the past several decades. This study investigates the impact of climate change and LCC on carbon dynamics in the YRD region for 1990–2019, taking advantage of a high-resolution vegetation model and two well-established LCC data in China. Simulated gross primary productivity increases from 0.52 ± 0.02 Pg[C] yr−1 in the 1990s to 0.57 ± 0.01 Pg[C] yr−1 in the 2010s with the major contribution by CO2 fertilization effect. The regional carbon sink, measured as net biospheric productivity (NBP), peaks at 0.03 Pg[C] yr−1 in the 2000s but remains stable or slightly decreases in the 2010s depending on the LCC datasets. Forests act as the main contributors to the enhancement of the regional carbon sink, with negative contributions from the loss of shrubland and grassland. The stable NBP during 2000–2019 suggests a potential slowdown in the efficacy of carbon sink as forests mature. While forest expansion significantly promotes NBP, the carbon released during the replacement of other vegetation types suggests that afforestation efforts need to be complemented with associated supportive measures to prevent newly forested areas from becoming net carbon sources."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad7309,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要研究了貉（Nyctereutes procyonoides）在上海市城市和郊区栖息地之间的行为差异，包括其活动范围、昼夜活动、运动和饮食。研究发现，城市地区的貉活动范围明显小于森林公园地区的貉，并且城市地区的貉夜间运动速度也明显降低。此外，城市地区的貉粪便样本中发现更多的人类食物成分，表明城市地区的貉觅食策略与森林公园地区的貉不同。该研究强调了哺乳动物行为研究在城市生物多样性管理中的重要性，并为缓解城市环境中人与动物冲突提供了科学依据。,[],Yihan Wang;Qianqian Zhao;Lishan Tang;Weiming Lin;Zhuojin Zhang;Yixin Diao;Yue Weng;Bojian Gu;Yidi Feng;Qing Zhao;Fang Wang,"Behavioral plasticity of raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) provides new insights for urban wildlife management in metropolis Shanghai, China","As urbanization exposes wildlife to new challenging conditions and environmental pressures, species that exhibit a high degree of behavioral plasticity are considered potentially capable of colonizing and adapting to urban environments. However, differences in the behavior of populations that inhabit urban and suburban landscapes pose unprecedented challenges to traditional methods in wildlife management which often fail to consider a species’ needs or mitigate human–wildlife conflict due to changes in species behavior in response to intensive human interference. Here, we investigate differences in the home range, diel activity, movement, and diet of raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) between residential districts and forest park habitats in Shanghai, China. Using GPS tracking data from 22 individuals, we find that the home ranges of raccoon dogs in residential districts (10.4 ± 8.8 ha) was 91.26% smaller than those in forest parks (119.6 ± 135.4 ha). We also find that raccoon dogs in residential districts exhibited significantly lower nocturnal movement speeds (134.55 ± 50.68 m h−1) compared to their forest park counterparts (263.22 ± 84.972 m h−1). An analysis of 528 fecal samples showed a significantly higher intake of ingredients from human food in residential districts (χ2 = 4.691, P = 0.026), which indicates that urban raccoon dog foraging strategies differ from the forest park population due to the presence of discarded human food, cat food, and wet garbage in residential districts. Based on our findings, we propose a community-based wildlife management strategy and suggest modifying the current design of residential districts. Our results underscore the importance of mammal behavior studies in urban biodiversity management and provide a scientific basis for mitigating human–wildlife conflicts in urban environments in and beyond our study area."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad7745,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要研究了近惯性振荡（NIOs）对海洋表面漂流物的轨迹的影响。研究人员利用粒子轨迹模型发现，中尺度涡旋和NIOs的共同作用会导致漂流物形成独特的“花状”轨迹。论文还分析了不同纬度下近惯性轨迹的周期和宽度变化，以及近惯性速度与背景速度的比例关系。研究结果表明，NIOs对海洋表面物质的分布、轨迹预测和海上救援行动具有重要影响。,"['ocean surface drifters', 'near-inertial oscillations', 'mesoscale eddies', 'particle trajectory model', 'South China Sea']",Yuhang Zheng;Wei Wu;Minyang Wang;Yuhong Zhang;Yan Du,Different trajectory patterns of ocean surface drifters modulated by near-inertial oscillations,"Near-inertial oscillations (NIOs) are widely observed dynamic motions in the global ocean, with a frequency related to earth’s rotation. Using a particle trajectory model, we found the combined influence of mesoscale eddies and NIOs could produce distinctive flower-like trajectories, which are a special case of near-inertial trajectories and were observed by surface drifters released within an anticyclone eddy in the South China Sea in 2021. The energy budget indicates that wind and geostrophic eddy currents are crucial in generating near-inertial energy during the flower-like trajectories. Furthermore, the particle trajectory model revealed variations in periods and widths of the near-inertial trajectory with latitudes. The width of near-inertial trajectories can exceed 8 km in the near-equatorial region and reach 3–6 km in the mid-latitude region (20°–50°). The ratios of near-inertial velocity to background velocity, defined as near-inertial trajectory shape index (NITSIs), lead to arc-shaped (0.5 < NITSI < 1.0), overlapping semi-circular (NITSI > 1.0), and near-circular trajectories (NITSI ≫ 1.0). Globally, approximately 1/3 of the drifters’ lifespan featured clear near-inertial trajectories, with a significant presence in most middle latitudes and the largest NITSI in the north Pacific westerly. These findings highlight the importance of NIOs and suggest their substantial impact on local surface matter distribution, trajectory prediction, and marine rescue operations."
10.5194/acp-24-10055-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究主要关注对流层顶逆温层（TIL）的特性，特别是湿度对其影响。TIL是位于对流层顶附近的一个重要特征，它对大气物质的垂直输送起着阻碍作用。研究利用高分辨率探空仪和ERA5再分析数据，分析了TIL的厚度、布鲁nt-Väisälä频率等特征与相对湿度之间的关系。研究发现，湿度较高的对流层顶附近，TIL更稳定，厚度更薄。研究还利用ERA5数据对北半球中纬度不同区域的TIL特性进行了季节性和区域性分析，发现TIL特性与相对湿度之间的关系在不同区域存在差异。,"['relative humidity', 'tropopause', 'tropopause inversion layer', 'radiosonde', 'ERA5 reanalysis data', 'atmospheric stability', 'transport barrier']",Daniel Köhler;Philipp Reutter;Peter Spichtinger,Relative humidity over ice as a key variable for Northern Hemisphere midlatitude tropopause inversion layers,"In this work, the influence of humidity on the properties of the tropopause is studied. The tropopause is the interface between the troposphere and the stratosphere and represents a barrier for the transport of air masses between the troposphere and the stratosphere. We consider not only the tropopause itself, but also a layer around it called the tropopause inversion layer (TIL). It is shown that the moister the underlying atmosphere is, the more this layer acts as a barrier. 
 The tropopause inversion layer (TIL) is a prominent feature of the midlatitude tropopause region, constituting a transport barrier.  Adiabatic and diabatic processes might contribute to the formation and sharpening of the inversion.  For both types of processes, relative humidity over ice is ideal for attribution; from theory and former model case studies, we expect enhanced relative humidity values with a sharp TIL.We use high-resolution radiosonde and ERA5 reanalysis data to show very good qualitative and quantitative agreement in terms of TIL features; thus, coarser ERA5 data can be used for further investigations. Next, we investigate the connection between TIL features and relative humidity measures in both radiosonde and ERA5 data, revealing a clear relationship. Moister profiles, on average, exhibit significantly higher maximum values of the Brunt–Väisälä frequency (N2), indicating a more stable stratification of the tropopause in these cases. This result holds true in both radiosonde measurements and ERA5 data. For TIL thickness, an inverse pattern emerges: moister, more stable TILs exhibit lower thickness.Because of the good agreement between radiosonde and ERA5 data, we use ERA5 data for seasonal and regional investigations. These analyses reveal consistent TIL properties in various midlatitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere under different meteorological conditions. However, differences in the strength of the dependence of TIL properties on relative humidity over ice are evident between the different regions."
10.5194/acp-24-10039-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文主要研究了北极低空云中微物理过程对云相态的影响。研究发现，蒸汽相变化过程在混合相云中起主导作用，而液态水和冰之间的过程则相对较弱。研究还发现，这些微物理过程对云的辐射特性有重要影响，这对于理解北极气候变化至关重要。论文使用了 ICON 模型和一个新的诊断工具来分析云相态变化过程，并评估了不同热力学条件下这些过程的行为。研究结果表明，北极低空混合相云的相态变化过程需要进一步研究，以提高气候模型的准确性。,"['cloud microphysics', 'cloud phase partitioning', 'satellite observations', 'cloud radiative properties', 'Arctic', 'low-level clouds']",Theresa Kiszler;Davide Ori;Vera Schemann,Microphysical processes involving the vapour phase dominate in simulated low-level Arctic clouds,"Microphysical processes impact the phase-partitioning of clouds. In this study we evaluate these processes while focusing on low-level Arctic clouds. To achieve this we used an extensive simulation set in combination with a new diagnostic tool. This study presents our findings on the relevance of these processes and their behaviour under different thermodynamic regimes. 
 Current general circulation models struggle to capture the phase-partitioning of clouds accurately, both overestimating and underestimating the supercooled liquid substantially. This impacts the radiative properties of clouds. Therefore, it is of interest to understand which processes determine the phase-partitioning. In this study, microphysical-process rates are analysed to study what role each phase-changing process plays in low-level Arctic clouds. Several months of cloud-resolving ICON simulations using a two-moment cloud microphysics scheme are evaluated. The microphysical-process rates are extracted using a diagnostic tool introduced here, which runs only the microphysical parameterization using previously simulated days. It was found that the processes impacting ice are more efficient during polar night than polar day. For the mixed-phase clouds (MPCs), it became clear that phase changes involving the vapour phase dominated in contrast to processes between liquid and ice. Computing the rate of the Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen process further indicated that the MPCs frequently (42 % of the time) seemed to be glaciating. Additionally, the dependence of each process on the temperature, vertical wind, and saturation was evaluated. This showed that, in particular, the temperature influences the occurrence and interactions of different processes. This study helps to better understand how microphysical processes act in different regimes. It additionally shows which processes play an important role in contributing to the phase-partitioning in Arctic low-level mixed-phase clouds. Therefore, these processes could potentially be better targeted for improvements in the ICON model that aim to more accurately represent the phase-partitioning of Arctic low-level mixed-phase clouds."

Thornhill;Luke D. Ziemba;Christiane Voigt,Understanding aerosol–cloud interactions using a single-column model for a cold-air outbreak case during the ACTIVATE campaign,"We examined marine boundary layer clouds and their interactions with aerosols in the E3SM single-column model (SCM) for a case study. The SCM shows good agreement when simulating the clouds with high-resolution models. It reproduces the relationship between cloud droplet and aerosol particle number concentrations as produced in global models. However, the relationship between cloud liquid water and droplet number concentration is different, warranting further investigation. 
 Marine boundary layer clouds play a critical role in Earth's energy balance. Their microphysical and radiative properties are highly impacted by ambient aerosols and dynamic forcings. In this study, we evaluate the representation of these clouds and related aerosol–cloud interaction processes in the single-column version of the E3SM climate model (SCM) against field measurements collected during the NASA ACTIVATE campaign over the western North Atlantic, as well as intercompare results with high-resolution process level models. We show that E3SM SCM reproduces the macrophysical properties of post-frontal boundary layer clouds in a cold-air outbreak (CAO) case well. However, it generates fewer but larger cloud droplets compared to aircraft measurements. Further sensitivity tests show that the underestimation of both aerosol number concentration and vertical velocity variance contributes to this bias. Aerosol–cloud interactions are examined by perturbing prescribed aerosol properties in E3SM SCM with fixed dynamics. Higher aerosol number concentration or hygroscopicity leads to more numerous but smaller cloud droplets, resulting in a stronger cooling via shortwave cloud forcing. This apparent Twomey effect is consistent with prior climate model studies. The cloud liquid water path shows a weakly positive relation with cloud droplet number concentration due to precipitation suppression. This weak aerosol effect on cloud macrophysics may be attributed to the dominant impact of strong dynamical forcing associated with the CAO. Our findings indicate that the SCM framework is a key tool to bridge the gap between climate models, process level models, and field observations to facilitate process level understanding."

This indicates that the natural density evolution needs to be analyzed. However, the middle-atmospheric density response to sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events has rarely been reported. In this study, the density distribution and mass transport process are illustrated based on observation data and global numerical model simulations during the 2021 major SSW event. 
 Sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs) are dramatic events in the polar winter stratosphere that are accompanied by atmospheric parameter anomalies in the stratosphere and mesosphere. Microwave Limb Sounder and Global Navigation Satellite System Occultation Sounder observations on board the Chinese FengYun 3 satellites indicate a rapid increase of over 50 % in the mesospheric density at high latitudes around the onset date during the 2021 major SSW event. The amplification of the zonal mean density around the onset is proportional to the latitude increase with a maximum increment of 83.3 % at 59 km above 80° N, which is more than 3 times larger than the climatological standard deviation (23.1 %). The horizontal density distributions are influenced by the changing polar vortex fields. A simulation using a specified dynamics version of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model reproduces the global circulation and presents a severe change in the planetary wave forcing and residual meridional circulation mass flux followed by a change in the density tendency. These results demonstrate that the observed enhanced density is primarily attributed to the altered planetary waves and residual circulation during the SSW event. The observations and simulations also indicate that the density anomalies could extend to middle latitudes. Obvious density disturbances in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere were observed by the lidar deployed in Beijing (40.3° N, 116.2° E)."

A new insight was offered: the contributions of HONO and O3 to the production rates of OH on the TP are even greater than in lower-altitudes areas. This study enriches the understanding of vertical distribution of atmospheric components and explains the strong atmospheric oxidation capacity (AOC) on the TP. 
 The Tibetan Plateau (TP) plays a key role in the regional environment and global climate change; however, the lack of vertical observations of atmospheric species, such as HONO and O3, hinders a deeper understanding of the atmospheric chemistry and atmospheric oxidation capacity (AOC) on the TP. In this study, we conducted multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements at Nam Co, the central TP, to observe the vertical profiles of aerosol, water vapor (H2O), NO2, HONO and O3 from May to July 2019. In addition to NO2 mainly exhibiting a Gaussian shape with the maximum value appearing at 300=-400 m, the other four species all showed an exponential shape and decreased with the increase in height. The maximum values of monthly averaged aerosol (0.17 km−1) and O3 (66.71 ppb) occurred in May, H2O (3.68 × 1017 molec. cm−3) and HONO (0.13 ppb) appeared in July, and NO2 (0.39 ppb) occurred in June at the 200–400 m layer. H2O, HONO and O3 all exhibited a multi-peak pattern, and aerosol appeared to have a bi-peak pattern for its averaged diurnal variations. The averaged vertical profiles of OH production rates from O3 and HONO all exhibited an exponential shape decreasing with the increase in height, with maximum values of 2.61 and 0.49 ppb h−1 at the bottom layer, respectively. The total OH production rate contributed by HONO and O3 on the TP was obviously larger than that in low-altitude areas. In addition, source analysis was conducted for HONO and O3 at different height layers. The heterogeneous reaction of NO2 on wet surfaces was a significant source of HONO. The maximum values of HONO/NO2 appeared when H2O concentrations were approximately 1.0 × 1017 molec. cm−3 and aerosol concentrations were larger than 0.15 km−1 below 1.0 km. The maximum values were usually accompanied by H2O concentrations of 1.0–2.0 × 1017 molec. cm−3 and aerosol concentrations greater than 0.02 km−1 at 1.0–2.0 km. O3 was potentially sourced from the South Asian subcontinent and Himalayas through long-range transport. Our results contribute to the new understanding of vertical distribution of atmospheric components and explain the strong AOC on the TP."

Thill,Joint spectral retrievals of ozone with Suomi NPP CrIS augmented by S5P/TROPOMI,"Characterizing the distribution of ozone in the atmosphere is a challenging problem, with current Earth observation satellites using either thermal infrared (TIR) or ultraviolet (UV) instruments, sensitive to different portions of the atmosphere, making it difficult to gain a full picture. In this work, we combine measurements from the TIR and UV instruments Suomi NPP CrIS and Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI to improve sensitivity through the whole atmosphere and improve knowledge of ozone distribution. 
 The vertical distribution of ozone plays an important role in atmospheric chemistry, climate change, air pollution, and human health. Over the 21st century, spaceborne remote-sensing methods and instrumentation have evolved to better determine this distribution. We quantify the ability of ozone retrievals to characterize this distribution through a sequential combination of thermal infrared (TIR) and ultraviolet (UV) spectral radiances, harnessing co-located TIR measurements from the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) and UV measurements from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), which is on the Sentinel 5-Precursor (S5P) satellite. Using the MUlti-SpEctra, MUlti-SpEcies, MUlti-SEnsors (MUSES) algorithm, the sequential combination of TIR and UV measurements, which follows retrievals from each instrument separately, moderately improves the ability of satellites to characterize global ozone profiles over the use of each instrument/band individually. The CrIS retrievals enhanced by TROPOMI radiances in the Huggins band (325–335 nm) show good agreement with independent datasets both in the troposphere and in the stratosphere in spite of calibration issues in the TROPOMI UV. Improved performance is characterized in the stratosphere from CrIS-TROPOMI, firstly through a modest increase in the degrees of freedom for signal (DFS; often between 0.1–0.2) and secondly through comparisons with the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), where a global multi-month-long comparison shows a mean difference ∼×10 lower than either CrIS or TROPOMI individually and R2 values 3 % higher. In the troposphere, CrIS-TROPOMI and CrIS show similar degrees of freedom for signal, with about 2 globally, but these are higher in the tropics partitioned equally between the lower and upper troposphere. CrIS-TROPOMI validation with ozonesondes shows improved performance over CrIS-only validation, with a difference in the tropospheric-column bias of between 30 % and 200 % depending on the season. Cross-comparisons with satellite instruments and reanalysis datasets show similar performances in terms of correlations and biases. These results demonstrate that CrIS and CrIS-TROPOMI retrievals have the potential to improve global satellite ozone retrievals, especially with future developments. If spectral accuracy is improved in future TROPOMI calibration, the degrees of freedom for signal in the stratosphere could double when using bands 1 and 2 of TROPOMI (270–330 nm), while tropospheric degrees of freedom for signal could increase by 25 %."

Following some preprocessing and quality control, radar measurements are incorporated into a model that uses swarm intelligence to seek the most suitable DSD to produce the input measurements. 
 Having knowledge of the drop size distribution (DSD) is of particular interest to researchers as it is widely applied to quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) methods. Polarimetric radar measurements have previously been utilized to derive DSD curve characteristics frequently modeled as a gamma distribution. Likewise, approaches using dual-frequency measurements have shown positive results. Both cases have relied on the need to constrain the relationship between the DSD parameters based on location or assumed weather conditions. This paper presents a methodology for retrieving the DSD parameters using the dual-frequency and polarimetric nature of measurements from a unique data set taken at co-located S-band and C-band dual-polarization radars. Using the reflectivity and differential-phase measurements from each radar, an optimization routine employing particle swarm optimization (PSO) and T-matrix computation of radar parameters is able to accurately retrieve the gamma distribution parameters without the constraints required in previous methods. Retrieved results are compared to known truth data collected using a network of OTT Parsivel disdrometers in Taiwan in order to assess the success of this procedure."

MTG-IRS will present a great deal of potential in the area of detecting different atmospheric species and will have the advantage of being based on a geostationary platform and acquiring data with a high temporal frequency (every 30 min over Europe), which makes it easier to track the transport of the species of interest.The present work aims to evaluate the potential impact, over a regional domain over Europe, of the assimilation of MTG-IRS radiances within a chemical transport model (CTM), Modèle de Chimie Atmosphérique de Grande Echelle (MOCAGE), operated by Météo-France.Since MTG-IRS is not yet in orbit, observations have been simulated using the observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) approach. Of the species to which MTG-IRS will be sensitive, the one treated in this study was ozone.The results obtained indicate that the assimilation of synthetic radiances of MTG-IRS always has a positive impact on the ozone analysis from MOCAGE. The relative average difference compared to the nature run (NR) in the ozone total columns improves from −30 % (no assimilation) to almost zero when MTG-IRS observations are available over the domain. Also remarkable is the reduction in the standard deviation of the difference with respect to the NR, which, in the area where MTG-IRS radiances are assimilated, reaches its lowest values (∼ 1.8 DU). When considering tropospheric columns, the improvement is also significant, from 15 %–20 % (no assimilation) down to 3 %. The error in the differences compared to the NR is lower than for total columns (minima ∼ 0.3 DU), due also to the  lower concentrations of the tropospheric ozone field. Overall, the impact of assimilation is considerable over the whole vertical column: vertical variations are noticeably improved compared to what is obtained when no assimilation is performed (up to 25 % better)."

Chen;Qiuhong Tang;Tammo Steenhuis;Wei Cheng;Wen Shi,Satellite-based near-real-time global daily terrestrial evapotranspiration estimates,"Timely global terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) data are crucial for water resource management and drought forecasting. This study introduces the VISEA algorithm, which integrates satellite data and shortwave radiation to provide daily 0.05° gridded near-real-time ET estimates. By employing a vegetation index–temperature method, this algorithm can estimate ET without requiring additional data. Evaluation results demonstrate VISEA's comparable accuracy with accelerated data availability. 
 Accurate and timely global evapotranspiration (ET) data are crucial for agriculture, water resource management, and drought forecasting. Although numerous satellite-based ET products are available, few offer near-real-time data. For instance, products like NASA's ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment mounted on the International Space Station (ECOSTRESS) and MOD16 face challenges such as uneven coverage and delays exceeding 1 week in data availability. In this study, we refined the Variation of the Standard Evapotranspiration Algorithm (VISEA) by fully integrating satellite-based data, e.g., European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA5-Land shortwave radiation (which includes satellite remote sensing data within its assimilation system) and MODIS land surface data (which include surface reflectance, temperature and/or emissivity, land cover, vegetation indices, and albedo as inputs). This enables VISEA to provide near-real-time global daily ET estimates with a maximum delay of 1 week at a resolution of 0.05°. Its accuracy was assessed globally using observation data from 149 flux towers across 12 land cover types and comparing them with five other satellite-based ET products and Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) data. The results indicate that VISEA provides accurate ET estimates that are comparable to existing products, achieving a mean correlation coefficient (R) of about 0.6 and an RMSE of 1.4 mm d−1. Furthermore, we demonstrated VISEA's utility in drought monitoring during a drought event in the Yangtze River basin in 2022 in which ET changes correlated with precipitation. The near-real-time capability of VISEA is, thus, especially valuable in meteorological and hydrological applications for coordinating drought relief efforts.

To understand how this affects the hydrology and ecosystems of the affected regions, it is important to measure glacier mass balance and ensure that records of field surveys are kept in standardized formats and well-documented. We describe glaciological measurements of ice ablation and snow accumulation gathered at Mullwitzkees and Venedigerkees, two glaciers in the Austrian Alps, since 2007 and 2012, respectively. 
 Glaciers in the Alps are losing mass at unprecedented and accelerating rates. Monitoring of glacier mass change as well as relevant atmospheric parameters plays an important role in improving understanding of local and downstream impacts. We present sub-seasonal, seasonal, and annual glaciological mass balance data and meteorological observations from Mullwitzkees and Venedigerkees, two glacier monitoring sites in the Hohe Tauern range of the Austrian Alps. Ablation stake networks were established on Mullwitzkees in 2006/07 and on Venedigerkees in 2011/12. Monitoring is ongoing. In addition to stake readings at sub-seasonal intervals, accumulation measurements (snow pits and probing) are carried out seasonally. The glaciological dataset consists of sub-seasonal floating-date measurements as well as fixed-date seasonal and annual values. The fixed-date glacier-wide mass balance was derived from annual point mass balance values. Automatic weather stations measuring standard meteorological parameters were installed near Mullwitzkees and Venedigerkees in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Meteorological data are provided in 10 min intervals. Uncertainties in individual point mass balance measurements were computed following the approach of the Swiss Glacier Monitoring (GLAMOS) programme, taking into account estimated density and reading errors. The sub-seasonal mass balance records highlight shorter-term variability in mass loss and the linkage with meteorological conditions. The most negative annual point mass balance recorded in the period of record was −5.8 ± 0.66 m w.e. at an elevation of 2536 m on Venedigerkees, and 2022 stands out as the most negative mass balance year to date in both time series, particularly at higher elevations. The cumulative specific mass balances (glacier-wide) over the period of record were −14.68 m w.e. at Mullwitzkees and −8.79 m w.e. at Venedigerkees. Data are available in the PANGAEA publication series and the associated datasets. The main publication series are updated annually. The Mullwitzkees mass balance datasets can be found in Stocker-Waldhuber et al. (2016) (https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.965660) and Stocker-Waldhuber et al.

 Long-term PM2.5 data are essential for the atmospheric environment, human health, and climate change. PM2.5 measurements are sparsely distributed and of short duration. In this study, daily PM2.5 concentrations are estimated using a machine learning method for the period from 1959 to 2022 in the Northern Hemisphere based on near-surface atmospheric visibility. They are extracted from the Integrated Surface Database (ISD). Daily continuous monitored PM2.5 concentration is set as the target, and near-surface atmospheric visibility and other related variables are used as the inputs. A total of 80 % of the samples of each site are the training set, and 20 % are the testing set. The training result shows that the slope of linear regression with a 95 % confidence interval (CI) between the estimated PM2.5 concentration and the monitored PM2.5 concentration is 0.955 [0.955, 0.955], the coefficient of determination (R2) is 0.95, the root mean square error (RMSE) is 7.2 µg m−3, and the mean absolute error (MAE) is 3.2 µg m−3. The test result shows that the slope within a 95 % CI between the predicted PM2.5 concentration and the monitored PM2.5 concentration is 0.864 [0.863, 0.865], the R2 is 0.79, the RMSE is 14.8 µg m−3, and the MAE is 7.6 µg m−3. Compared with a global PM2.5 concentration dataset derived from a satellite aerosol optical depth product with 1 km resolution, the slopes of linear regression on the daily (monthly) scale are 0.817 (0.854) from 2000 to 2021, 0.758 (0.821) from 2000 to 2010, and 0.867 (0.879) from 2011 to 2022, indicating the accuracy of the model and the consistency of the estimated PM2.5 concentration on the temporal scale. The interannual trends and spatial patterns of PM2.5 concentration on the regional scale from 1959 to 2022 are analyzed using a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM), suitable for situations with an uneven spatial distribution of monitoring sites. The trend is the slope of the Theil–Sen estimator. In Canada, the trend is −0.10 µg m−3 per decade, and the PM2.5 concentration exhibits an east–high to west–low pattern. In the United States, the trend is −0.40 µg m−3 per decade, and PM2.5 concentration decreases significantly after 1992, with a trend of −1.39 µg m−3 per decade. The areas of high PM2.5 concentration are in the east and west, and the areas of low PM2.5 concentration are in the central and northern regions. In Europe, the trend is −1.55 µg m−3 per decade. High-concentration areas are distributed in eastern Europe, and the low-concentration areas are in northern and western Europe. In China, the trend is 2.09 µg m−3 per decade. High- concentration areas are distributed in northern China, and the low-concentration areas are distributed in southern China. The trend is 2.65 µg m−3 per decade up to 2011 and −22.23 µg m−3 per decade since 2012. In India, the trend is 0.92 µg m−3 per decade. The concentration exhibits a north–high to south–low pattern, with high-concentration areas distributed in northern India, such as the Ganges Plain and Thar Desert, and the low-concentration area in the Deccan Plateau. The trend is 1.41 µg m−3 per decade up to 2013 and −23.36 µg m−3 per decade from 2014. The variation in regional PM2.5 concentrations is closely related to the implementation of air quality laws and regulations. The daily site-scale PM2.5 concentration dataset from 1959 to 2022 in the Northern Hemisphere is available at the National Tibetan Plateau/Third Pole Environment Data Center (https://doi.org/10.11888/Atmos.tpdc.301127) (Hao et al., 2024)."

Our experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in developing environmental models and maps. Tailored feature selection is crucial for its effective use in environmental modeling. It aims to support comprehensive environmental monitoring and analysis, helping researchers and policymakers in managing environmental resources. 
 The production and evaluation of the Analysis Ready and Cloud Optimized (ARCO) data cube for continental Europe (including Ukraine, the UK, and Turkey), derived from the Landsat Analysis Ready Data version 2 (ARD V2) produced by Global Land Analysis and Discovery team (GLAD) and covering the period from 2000 to 2022 is described. The data cube consists of 17TB of data at a 30–meter resolution and includes bimonthly, annual, and long-term spectral indices on various thematic topics, including: surface reflectance bands, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR), Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Difference Tillage Index (NDTI), minimum Normalized Difference Tillage Index (minNDTI), Bare Soil Fraction (BSF), Number of Seasons (NOS), and Crop Duration Ratio (CDR). The data cube was developed with the intention of providing a comprehensive feature space for environmental modeling and soil, vegetation, and land cover mapping. To evaluate its effectiveness for this purpose, the quality of the produced time series was assessed by: (1) visual examination for artifacts and inconsistencies, (2) plausibility checks with ground survey data, and (3) predictive modeling tests, examples with soil organic carbon (SOC) and land cover (LC) classification. The results of visual examination indicate that the gap-filled product is complete and consistent, except for winter periods in northern latitudes and high-altitude areas where high cloud and snow density make gap-filling complex, and hence many artifacts remain. The plausibility results further show that the indices effectively help differentiate landscapes and crop types: the BSF index showed a strong negative correlation (-0.73) with crop coverage data, effectively detecting soil exposure. The minNDTI index had a moderate positive correlation (0.57) with the Eurostat tillage practices survey data, indicating valuable information on the intensity of the tillage. The detailed temporal resolution and long-term characteristics provided by different tiers of predictors in this data cube proved to be important for both soil organic carbon regression and LC classification experiments based on the 60,723 LUCAS observations: long-term characteristics (tier 4) were particularly valuable for predictive mapping of SOC and LC coming on the top of variable importance assessment. Crop-specific indices (NOS and CDR) provided limited value for the tested applications, possibly due to noise or insufficient quantification methods.

A quasi-Bayesian method enhances the stability of the solution of the Measurement Error Proxy System Model. 
 Proxy system models (PSMs) are an essential component of paleoclimate data assimilation and for testing climate field reconstruction methods. Generally, current statistical PSMs consider the noise in the output (proxy) variable only and ignore the noise in the input (environmental) variables. This problem is exacerbated when there are several input variables.  Here we develop a new PSM, the Measurement Error Proxy System Model (MEPSM), which includes noise in all variables, including noise auto- and cross-correlation. The MEPSM is calibrated using a quasi-Bayesian solution, which leverages Gaussian conjugacy to produce a fast solution.  Another advantage of MEPSM is that the prior can be used to stabilize the solution between an informative prior (e.g., with a non-zero mean) and the maximum likelihood solution. MEPSM is illustrated by calibrating a proxy model for δ18Ocoral with multiple inputs (marine temperature and salinity), including noise in all variables. MEPSM is applicable to many different climate proxies and will improve our understanding of the effects of predictor noise on PSMs, data assimilation, and climate reconstruction."

Electro-coalescence is when oppositely charged droplets stick together. We introduce an analytical expression of electro-coalescence probability and use it in a warm-cumulus-cloud simulation. Results show that charge cases increase rain and droplet size, with the new method outperforming older ones. The new method requires longer computation time, but its impact on rain justifies inclusion in meteorology models. 
 The phenomenon of electric fields applied to droplets, inducing droplet coalescence, is called the electro-coalescence effect. An analytic expression for electro-coalescence with the accurate electrostatic force for a pair of droplets with opposite-sign charges is established by treating the droplets as conducting spheres (CSs). To investigate this effect, we applied a weak electric field to a cumulus cloud using a cloud model that employs the super-droplet method, a probabilistic particle-based microphysics method. This study employs a two-dimensional (2D) large-eddy simulation (LES) in a flow-coupled model to examine aerosol microphysics (such as collision–coalescence enhancement, velocity fluctuations, and supersaturation fluctuations) in warm cumulus clouds without relying on subgrid dynamics. In the simulation, we assume that droplets carry opposite-sign charges and are well mixed within the cloud. The charge is not treated as an individual particle attribute. To assess fluctuation effects, we conducted 50 simulations with varying pseudo-random number sequences for each electro-coalescence treatment. The results show that, with CS treatment, the electrostatic force contributes a larger effect on cloud evolution than in previous research. With a lower charge limit of the maximum charge amount on the droplet, the domain total precipitation with CS treatment for droplets with opposite signs is higher than that with the no-charge (NC) setting. Compared to previous work, the multi-image dipole treatment of CS results in higher precipitation. It is found that the electro-coalescence effect could affect rain formation even when the droplet charge is at the lower charge limit. High pollution levels result in greater sensitivity to electro-coalescence. The results show that, when the charge ratio between two droplets is over 100, the short-range attractive electric force due to the multi-image dipole would also significantly enhance precipitation for the cumulus. It is indicated that, although the accurate treatment of the electrostatic force with the CS method would require 30 % longer computation time than before, it is worthwhile to include it in cloud, weather, and climate models."

It solves equations that describe the dynamics and the growth and melt of sea ice. To do so, the domain is divided into grid cells and variables are positioned at specific locations in the cells. A new implementation (C-grid) is presented, with the velocity located on cell edges. Compared to the previous B-grid, the C-grid allows for a natural coupling with some oceanic and atmospheric models. It also allows for ice transport in narrow channels. 
 This article presents the C-grid implementation of the CICE sea ice model, including the C-grid discretization of the momentum equation, the boundary conditions (BCs), and the modifications to the code required to use the incremental remapping transport scheme. To validate the new C-grid implementation, many numerical experiments were conducted and compared to the B-grid solutions. In idealized experiments, the standard advection method (incremental remapping with C-grid velocities interpolated to the cell corners) leads to a checkerboard pattern. A modal analysis demonstrates that this computational noise originates from the spatial averaging of C-grid velocities at corners. The checkerboard pattern can be eliminated by adjusting the departure regions to match the divergence obtained from the solution of the momentum equation. We refer to this novel approach as the edge flux adjustment (EFA) method. The C-grid discretization with edge flux adjustment allows for transport in channels that are one grid cell wide – a capability that is not possible with the B-grid discretization nor with the C-grid and standard remapping advection. Simulation results match the predicted values of a novel analytical solution for one-grid-cell-wide channels."

Winkler,DeepPhenoMem V1.0: deep learning modelling of canopy greenness dynamics accounting for multi-variate meteorological memory effects on vegetation phenology,"Our study employs long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to model canopy greenness and phenology, integrating meteorological memory effects. The LSTM model outperforms traditional methods, enhancing accuracy in predicting greenness dynamics and phenological transitions across plant functional types. Highlighting the importance of multi-variate meteorological memory effects, our research pioneers unlock the secrets of vegetation phenology responses to climate change with deep learning techniques. 
 Vegetation phenology plays a key role in controlling the seasonality of ecosystem processes that modulate carbon, water and energy fluxes between the biosphere and atmosphere. Accurate modelling of vegetation phenology in the interplay of Earth's surface and the atmosphere is thus crucial to understand how the coupled system will respond to and shape climatic changes. Phenology is controlled by meteorological conditions at different timescales: on the one hand, changes in key meteorological variables (temperature, water, radiation) can have immediate effects on the vegetation development; on the other hand, phenological changes can be driven by past environmental conditions, known as memory effects. However, the processes governing meteorological memory effects on phenology are not completely understood, resulting in their limited performance of vegetation phenology represented in land surface models. A deep learning model, specifically a long short-term memory network (LSTM), has the potential to capture and model the meteorological memory effects on vegetation phenology. Here, we apply the LSTM to model the vegetation phenology using meteorological drivers and high-temporal-resolution canopy greenness observations through digital repeat photography by the PhenoCam network. We compare a multiple linear regression model, a no-memory-effect LSTM model and a full-memory-effect LSTM model to predict the whole seasonal greenness trajectory and the corresponding phenological transition dates across 50 sites and 317 site years during 2009–2018, covering deciduous broadleaf forests, evergreen needleleaf forests and grasslands. Results show that the deep learning model outperforms the multiple linear regression model, and the full-memory-effect LSTM model performs better than the no-memory-effect model for all three plant function types (median R2 of 0.878, 0.957 and 0.955 for broadleaf forests, evergreen needleleaf forests and grasslands). We also find that the full-memory-effect LSTM model is capable of predicting the seasonal dynamic variations of canopy greenness and reproducing trends in shifting phenological transition dates.

It includes process representations of an empirical, semi-empirical, and physical nature. It uses temperature, precipitation, humidity, radiation, and wind speed as forcing data and is computationally efficient, of a modular nature, and easily extendible. The Python code is available on GitHub (https://github.com/openamundsen/openamundsen), including documentation (https://doc.openamundsen.org). 
 openAMUNDSEN (the open source version of the Alpine MUltiscale Numerical Distributed Simulation ENgine) is a fully distributed snow-hydrological model, designed primarily for calculating the seasonal evolution of snow cover and melt rates in mountain regions. It resolves the mass and energy balance of snow-covered surfaces and layers of the snowpack, thereby including the most important processes that are relevant in complex mountain topography. The potential model applications are very versatile; typically, it is applied in areas ranging from the point scale to the regional scale (i.e., up to some thousands of square kilometers) using a spatial resolution of 10–1000 m and a temporal resolution of 1–3 h or daily. Temporal horizons may vary between single events and climate change scenarios. The openAMUNDSEN model has already been used for many applications, which are referenced herein. It features a spatial interpolation of meteorological observations, several layers of snow with different density and liquid-water contents, wind-induced lateral redistributions, snow–canopy interactions, glacier ice responses to climate, and more. The model can be configured according to each specific application case. A basic consideration for its development was to include a variety of process descriptions of different complexity to set up individual model runs which best match a compromise between physical detail, transferability, simplicity, and computational performance for a certain region in the European Alps, typically a (preferably gauged) hydrological catchment. The Python model code and example data are available as an open-source project on GitHub (https://github.com/openamundsen/openamundsen, last access: 1 June 2024)."

Comparisons with observations reveal that the model accurately represents carbon fluxes and stocks. Despite the underestimations in certain land-use conversions, the model describes general trends in soil carbon response to land-use change, aligning with the site observations. 
 Land-use change (LUC) impacts biospheric carbon, encompassing biomass carbon and soil organic carbon (SOC). Despite the use of dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) in estimating the anthropogenic perturbation of biospheric carbon stocks, critical evaluations of model performance concerning LUC impacts are scarce. Here, we present a systematic evaluation of the performance of the DGVM Organising Carbon and Hydrology in Dynamic Ecosystems (ORCHIDEE) in reproducing observed LUC impacts on biospheric carbon stocks over Europe. First, we compare model predictions with observation-based gridded estimates of net and gross primary productivity (NPP and GPP), biomass growth patterns, and SOC stocks. Second, we evaluate the predicted response of soil carbon stocks to LUC based on data from forest inventories, paired plots, chronosequences, and repeated sampling designs. Third, we use interpretable machine learning to identify factors contributing to discrepancies between simulations and observations, including drivers and processes not resolved in ORCHIDEE (e.g. erosion, soil fertility). Results indicate agreement between the model and observed spatial patterns and temporal trends, such as the increase in biomass with age, when simulating biosphere carbon stocks. The direction of the SOC responses to LUC generally aligns between simulated and observed data. However, the model underestimates carbon gains for cropland-to-grassland conversions and carbon losses for grassland-to-cropland and forest-to-cropland conversions. These discrepancies are attributed to bias arising from soil erosion rate, which is not fully captured in ORCHIDEE. Our study provides an oriented benchmark for assessing the DGVMs against observations and explores their potential in studying the impact of LUCs on SOC stocks."

Adapting GHMs to ungauged basins requires regionalization, enabling valid simulations. In this study, we highlight the impact of regionalization of GHMs on runoff simulations using an ensemble of regionalization methods for WaterGAP3. We have found that regionalization leads to temporally and spatially varying uncertainty, potentially reaching up to inter-model differences. 
 Valid simulation results from global hydrological models (GHMs), such as WaterGAP3, are essential for detecting hotspots or studying patterns in climate change impacts. However, the lack of worldwide monitoring data makes it challenging to adapt GHM parameters to enable such valid simulations globally. Therefore, regionalization is necessary to estimate parameters in ungauged basins. This study presents the results of regionalization methods for the first time applied to the GHM WaterGAP3. It aims to provide insights into (1) selecting a suitable regionalization method for a GHM and (2) evaluating its impact on runoff simulation. In this study, four new regionalization methods have been identified as appropriate for WaterGAP3. These methods span the full spectrum of methodologies, i.e., regression-based methods, physical similarity, and spatial proximity, using traditional and machine-learning-based approaches. Moreover, the methods differ in the descriptors used to achieve optimal results, although all utilize climatic and physiographic descriptors. This demonstrates (1) that different methods use descriptor sets with varying efficiency and (2) that combining climatic and physiographic descriptors is optimal for regionalizing worldwide basins. Additionally, our research indicates that regionalization leads to spatially and temporally varying uncertainty in ungauged regions. For example, regionalization highly affects southern South America, leading to high uncertainties in the flood simulation of the Río Deseado. The local impact of regionalization propagates through the water system, also affecting global estimates, as evidenced by a spread of 1500 km3 yr−1 across an ensemble of five regionalization methods in simulated global runoff to the ocean. This discrepancy is even more pronounced when using a regionalization method deemed unsuitable for WaterGAP3, resulting in a spread of 4208 km3 yr−1. This significant increase highlights the importance of carefully choosing regionalization methods. Further research is needed to enhance the predictor selection and the understanding of the robustness of the methods on a global scale."

However, the underlying mechanisms of nZVI sulfidation are poorly known. We studied the effects of Fe2+ on 24-h dynamics of nZVI sulfidation by HS– using a dosed S to Fe molar ratio of 0.2. This shows that in the absence of Fe2+, HS– rapidly adsorbed onto nZVI particles and reacted with surface iron oxide to form mackinawite and greigite (<0.5 h). As nZVI corrosion progressed, amorphous FeSx in solution deposited on nZVI, forming S-nZVI (0.5–24 h). However, in the initial presence of Fe2+, the rapid reaction between HS– and Fe2+ produced amorphous FeSx, which deposited on the nZVI and corroded the surface iron oxide layer (<0.25 h). This was followed by redeposition of colloidal iron (hydr)oxide on the particle surface (0.25–8 h) and deposition of residual FeSx (8–24 h) on S-nZVI. S loading on S-nZVI was 1 order of magnitude higher when Fe2+ was present. Surface characterization of the sulfidated particles by TEM-SAED, XPS, and XAFS verified the solution dynamics and demonstrated that S2– and S22–/Sn2– were the principal reduced S species on S-nZVI. This study provides a methodology to tune sulfur loading and S speciation on S-nZVI to suit remediation needs."

As TCS is ubiquitous in the aquatic environment, many previous studies have documented the effects of exposure to TCS on aquatic organisms. Nevertheless, most of the research has concentrated on the molecular and physiological responses of TCS, but there are still limited studies on the function of specific genes and the consequences of their absence. In this study, we focused on p53, a gene that is crucial for molecular responses such as autophagy and apoptosis as a result of TCS exposure. In order to ascertain the role and impact of the p53 gene in TCS-induced molecular responses, we examined the molecular responses to TCS-induced oxidative stress in wild-type (WT) and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated p53 mutant (MT) water fleas. The result has been accomplished by examining changes in molecular mechanisms, including in vivo end points, enzyme activities, adenosine triphosphate release rate, and apoptosis, to determine the role and impact of the p53 gene on TCS-induced molecular responses. The results indicated that the sensitivity of MT water fleas to TCS was greater than that of WT water fleas; however, the difference in sensitivity was significant at short exposures within 48 h and decreased toward 48 h. Accordingly, when we confirmed the oxidative stress after 24 h of exposure, the oxidative stress to TCS exposure was stronger in the MT group, with an imbalance of redox. To identify the mechanisms of tolerance to TCS in WT and MT Daphnia magna, we checked mitochondrial and ER-stress-related biomarkers and found an increase in apoptosis and greater sensitivity to TCS exposure in the MT group than in the WT. Our results suggest that the absence of p53 caused alterations in molecular processes in response to TCS exposure, resulting in increased sensitivity to TCS, and that p53 plays a critical role in response to TCS exposure."

However, their combined toxicity with arsenic remains poorly understood. Herein, we investigated the combined mitochondrial genotoxicity of CDs and arsenate at environmentally relevant concentrations across successive earthworm generations. Iron-doped CDs (CDs–Fe) strongly bound to arsenate and arsenite, while nitrogen-doped CDs (CDs–N) exhibited weaker binding. Both CDs enhanced arsenate bioaccumulation without affecting its biotransformation, with most arsenate being reduced to arsenite. CDs–Fe generated significantly more reactive oxygen species than did CDs–N, causing stronger mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage. Arsenate further exacerbated the oxidative mtDNA damage induced by CDs–N, as evidenced by increased reactive oxygen species, elevated 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels, and a higher correlation between 8-OHdG and mtDNA damage. This was due to arsenic inhibiting the antioxidant enzyme catalase. This exacerbation was negligible with CDs–Fe because their strong binding with arsenic prevented catalase inhibition. Maternal mitochondrial DNA damage was inherited by filial earthworms, which experienced significant weight loss in coexposure groups coupled with mtDNA toxicity. This study reveals the synergistic genotoxicity of CDs and arsenate, suggesting that CDs could disrupt the arsenic biogeochemical cycle, increase arsenate risk to terrestrial animals, and influence ecosystem stability and health through multigenerational impacts."

Meanwhile, as an essential element, Cu has been implicated in key processes associated with aging, raising questions about its role in age-related health issues. This study delves into the mechanisms behind the copper imbalance during aging. By analyzing blood copper concentrations of healthy individuals (including data from healthy subjects (26 ≤ age ≤ 90, n = 62) and publicly available data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (18 ≤ age < 80, n = 1624)) and employing C57BL/6N male mice models (n = 22), we reveal a consistent age-related increase in copper levels, particularly in plasma. Utilizing stable copper isotopic analysis, copper-associated protein analysis, and metabolomic analysis, we trace the sources of Cu imbalance associated with aging. Our findings reveal that aged mice had a higher copper concentrations and an enrichment of light copper isotope (63Cu) in plasma compared to controls. Additionally, copper reductases and copper transporters are upregulated in the intestine tract, associated with the AMPK and mTOR signaling pathways. We suggest that aged mice have an abnormally high copper intake requirement, probably due to deregulated nutrient sensing, leading to increased expression levels of copper reductases and copper transporters for extra copper absorption in the intestines. This research provides a copper-centric perspective on the connection between deregulated nutrient sensing and aging, thus shedding light on the aspect of aging and copper overexposure."

Complex relations between topographic and environmental attributes characterizing landslide susceptibility at local scales are not transferrable across areas without landslide data. Existing maps with multiple susceptibility classifications under‐represent landslide potential in moderate and gently sloping terrain. We leverage an extensive landslide database (N = 613,724), a high‐resolution digital elevation model (10‐m), and high‐performance computing resources, to develop a new nationwide susceptibility map for the contiguous United States, Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico. We calculate four alternative linear and nonlinear thresholds of topographic slope and relief using an objective split‐sample calibration. We down‐sample our results to a 90‐m grid to account for uncertainty in the digital elevation model and landslide position, and evaluate these thresholds' ability to differentiate areas of greater susceptibility. The less conservative nonlinear model optimally balances our priorities of capturing observed landslides (99%) while minimizing area covered by susceptible terrain (43%). Independent evaluation with four statewide landslide inventories (N = 172,367) reinforces our model selection but highlights spatially variable performance. Therefore, we propose a novel approach to susceptibility classification using the concentration of landslide‐prone terrain within each down‐sampled grid. While landslides are possible within any cells containing susceptible terrain, those with the highest concentration capture the majority of observed landslides. Our new map characterizes landside susceptibility more consistently than prior models; our transparent classification approach also provides flexibility for accommodating different tolerances in risk reduction measures."

In the first stage, the current remains limited at a relatively small value, while the electric field exhibited a slow rising behavior with positive polarity. In the second stage, the current starts to increase, and the electric field rapidly intensifies due to the accumulating charge, and the wire is assumed to experience an explosion. In the third stage, the reconnection process occurs. The current is characterized by a peak value of 1.45 kA with 10%–90% risetime of 10.4 μs. The electric fields suffer from notable decrease and are characterized by a microsecond‐scale V‐shape pulse. The current cutoff is quite short that almost not found. In the fourth step, the current is characterized by superimposed pulses. The final stage is the channel darkening."

Okubo‐Weiss parameter analysis reveals a distinctive meridional pattern of cyclonic and anticyclonic SE distribution in the interior western Pacific basin that aligns with zonally elongated mean flows. These westward‐propagating SEs play a pivotal role in regulating the formation of zonal undercurrents, particularly off‐equatorial regions, through the convergence of eddy potential vorticity flux. Along the Pacific western boundary region, anticyclonic SEs typically enhance (reverse) the velocity of boundary currents flowing northward (southward), primarily through barotropic energy conversion, while cyclonic SEs do the opposite. To summarize, we provide a schematic map of the circulation system in the western Pacific and emphasize the interconnected framework of undercurrents, particularly in relation to SEs."

However, mid‐latitude auroras were observed by naked eyes at Beijing China (39°N, 116°E) unusually during a moderate storm event on 1 December 2023 with the minimum Sym‐H index only ∼ ${\sim} $ −120 nT. This study combines conjugative in‐site and ground‐based observations to analyze the auroras and underlying physical processes. Results indicate that both electron and proton auroras appeared at low latitudes. Electron auroras predominantly arise from low‐energy electron precipitation, but proton auroras may be explained by energetic tens of keV proton precipitation. Pc1/EMIC waves are observed at low latitudes in the ionosphere, potentially accounting for mid‐latitude proton auroras. Downward field‐aligned currents (FACs) are also detected at low latitudes, producing significant magnetic perturbations.

However, the effect of seamounts on the air‐sea CO2 flux has not yet been well studied. In September 2021, the air‐sea CO2 flux was measured directly using eddy covariance (EC), and discrete waterside sampling was conducted. The results indicate that the northern South China Sea is a source of atmospheric CO2. Furthermore, EC measurements show that the seamount emits CO2 at an average rate of 0.34 mmol m−2 hr−1, nearly double that of non‐seamount areas. We suggest that the upwelling around the seamount transports deep water rich in dissolved inorganic carbon to the upper ocean, increasing the partial pressure of CO2 there. In addition, the increase in nutrients caused by the upwelling would increase the concentration of chlorophyll‐a, resulting in a productive area that emits CO2."

Here we present a method to distinguish between injection‐driven and earthquake‐driven triggering of induced seismicity by combining a calibrated, fully coupled, poroelastic stress model of wastewater injection with interpretation of a machine learning algorithm trained on both earthquake catalog and modeled stress features. We investigate seismicity from Paradox Valley, Colorado as an ideal test case: a single, high‐pressure injector that has induced thousands of earthquakes since 1991. Using feature importance analysis, we find that injection‐driven earthquakes are approximately 22± $\pm $5% of the total catalog but act as background events that can trigger subsequent aftershocks. Injection‐driven events also have distinct spatiotemporal clustering properties with a larger b‐value, closer proximity to the well, and earlier occurrence in the injection history. Generalization of our technique can help characterize triggering processes in other regions where induced seismicity occurs."

The results indicate that the average concentrations of SOA tracers were 16.1 ± 9.8 ng m−3 in winter and 99.4 ± 57.2 ng m−3 in summer. During winter, anthropogenic SOA (ASOA, the sum of SOA derived from naphthalene and mono‐aromatic volatile organic compounds) dominated, whereas isoprene SOA (SOAI) prevailed in summer. Correlation analysis between SO42− and both SOAI and high‐order monoterpene SOA tracers (SOAM‐H) (R = 0.46–0.72, p < 0.001) revealed that higher aerosol acidity facilitated the formation of SOAI and SOAM‐H, with SO2 emissions playing a significant role in leading to higher acidity. Most biogenic SOA (BSOA) tracers exhibited a significant positive correlation with NO3−, particularly in winter, implying the remarkable influence of NOx emissions on BSOA formation. The levels of BSOA tracers increased with NH3, indicating that NH3 can enhance the formation of BSOA. In summer, SOA formation correlated with Ox (Ox = O3 + NO2), indicating the substantial impact of atmospheric oxidizing capacity on SOA formation. During winter, aerosol liquid water content (ALWC) correlated well with SOAI tracers (i.e., 3‐hydroxyglutaric acid (3‐HGA) and 3‐hydroxy‐4,4‐dimethylglutaric acid (3‐HDMGA)), and 2,3‐dihydroxy‐4‐oxopentanoic acid (DHOPA) (R > 0.5, p < 0.001), indicating the important contribution of aqueous‐phase formation of SOA.

The study spans the 2018–2021 Atlantic Basin hurricane seasons and is unique as it provides the first known analysis of total lightning (intra‐cloud and cloud‐to‐ground) observed in TCs through their extratropical transition and post‐tropical cyclone (PTC) phases. We consider the TC lifecycle stage, geographic location (e.g., land, coast, and ocean), shear strength, and quadrant relative to the storm motion and environmental shear vectors. Total lightning maxima are found in the forward right quadrant relative to storm motion and downshear of the TC center, consistent with previous studies using mainly cloud‐to‐ground lightning. Increasing environmental shear focuses the lightning maxima to the downshear right quadrant with respect to the shear vector in tropical storm phases. Vertical profiles of radar reflectivity from the Global Precipitation Measurement mission show that super‐electrically active convective precipitation features (>75 flashes) within the PTC phase of TCs have deeper mixed phase depths and higher reflectivity at −10°C than other phases, indicating the presence of more intense convection. Differences in the net convective behavior observed throughout TC evolution manifest in both the TC‐scale frequency of lightning‐producing cells and the intensity variations amongst individual convective cells. The combination of continuous lightning observations and precipitation snapshots improves our understanding of convective‐scale processes in TCs, especially in PTC phases, as they traverse the tropics and mid‐latitudes."

 Modern sequencing technology enables the systematic detection of complex structural variation (SV) across genomes.

These sSVs explain otherwise cryptic variation in medically relevant regions such as the TPSAB1 gene, 8p23.1, 22q11 and Sotos syndrome regions. Comparisons with great ape assemblies indicate that most human sSVs formed recently, after the human-ape split, and involved non-repeat-mediated processes in addition to non-allelic homologous recombination. NAHRwhals reliably discovers and characterizes sSVs at scale and independent of species, uncovering their genomic abundance and suggesting broader implications for disease.

 Understanding the causes of the  ~90 ppmv atmospheric CO2 swings between glacial and interglacial climates is an important open challenge in paleoclimate research. Although the regularity of the glacial-interglacial cycles hints at a single driving mechanism, Earth System models require many independent physical and biological processes to explain the full observed CO2 signal. Here we show that biologically sequestered carbon in the ocean can explain an atmospheric CO2 change of 75 ± 40 ppmv, based on a mass balance calculation using published carbon isotopic measurements. An analysis of the carbon isotopic signatures of different water masses indicates similar regenerated carbon inventories at the Last Glacial Maximum and during the Holocene, requiring that the change in carbon storage was dominated by disequilibrium. We attribute the inferred change in carbon disequilibrium to expansion of sea-ice or change in the overturning circulation.

 Maintaining normal thyroid function is crucial in pregnancy, yet thyroid dysfunction and the presence of thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) affect 0.5% to 18% of pregnant women. Here, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of eight thyroid traits, including two thyroid-related hormones, four thyroid dysfunctions, and two thyroid autoimmunity measurements among 85,421 Chinese pregnant women to investigate the genetic basis of thyroid function during pregnancy. Our study identified 176 genetic loci, including 125 previously unknown genome-wide associations. Joint epidemiological and Mendelian randomization analyses revealed significant associations between the gestational thyroid phenotypes and gestational complications, birth outcomes, and later-age health outcomes. Specifically, genetically elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels during pregnancy correlated with lower glycemic levels, reduced blood pressure, and longer gestational duration. Additionally, TPOAb and thyroid functions during pregnancy share genetic correlations with later-age thyroid and cardiac disorders.

Here, the authors discover an intrinsic dipole Hall effect in various magnetic insulating states of twisted MoTe2—enabling contact-free detection of topological phase transitions. 
 We discover an intrinsic dipole Hall effect in a variety of magnetic insulating states at integer fillings of twisted MoTe2 moiré superlattice, including topologically trivial and nontrivial ferro-, antiferro-, and ferri-magnetic configurations. The dipole Hall current, in linear response to in-plane electric field, generates an in-plane orbital magnetization M∥ along the field, through which an AC field can drive magnetization oscillation up to THz range. Upon the continuous topological phase transitions from trivial to quantum anomalous Hall states in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic configurations, the dipole Hall current and M∥ have an abrupt sign change, enabling contact-free detection of the transitions through the magnetic stray field. In configurations where the linear response is forbidden by symmetry, the dipole Hall current and M∥ appear as a crossed nonlinear response to both in-plane and out-of-plane electric fields. These magnetoelectric phenomena showcase fascinating functionalities of insulators from the interplay between magnetism, topology, and electrical polarization.

Here, authors apply semiconductor fluid molecular plasticizers to improve stretchable deformability, achieving high performance flexible polymer light-emitting diodes. 
 Fully π-conjugated polymers with rigid aromatic units are promising for flexible optoelectronic devices, but their inherent brittleness poses a challenge for achieving high-performance, intrinsically stretchable fully π-conjugated polymer. Here, we are establishing an external-plasticizing strategy using semiconductor fluid plasticizers (Z1 and Z2) to enhance the optoelectronic, morphological, and stretchable properties of fully π-conjugated polymer films for flexible light-emitting diodes. The synergistic effect of hierarchical structure and optoelectronic properties of Z1 in poly(9,9-di-n-octylfluorene-alt-benzothiadiazole) (F8BT) films enable excellent stretchable deformability (~25%) and good conductivity. PLEDs based on F8BT/Z1 films show stable electroluminescence and efficiency under 15% stretch and 100 cycles at 10% strain, revealing outstanding stress tolerance. This strategy is also improving the stretchable properties of polymers like poly(9,9-di-n-octylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl) (PFO) and poly(2-methoxy-5(2′-ethyl)hexoxy-phenylenevinylene) (Super Yellow), demonstrating its general applicability. Therefore, this strategy can provide effective guidance for designing high-performance stretchable fully π-conjugated polymers films for flexible electronic devices.

 The use of monoclonal antibodies for the control of drug resistant nosocomial bacteria may alleviate a reliance on broad spectrum antimicrobials for treatment of infection. We identify monoclonal antibodies that may prevent infection caused by carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. We use human immune repertoire mice (Kymouse platform mice) as a surrogate for human B cell interrogation to establish an unbiased strategy to probe the antibody-accessible target landscape of clinically relevant A. baumannii. After immunisation of the Kymouse platform mice with A. baumannii derived outer membrane vesicles (OMV) we identify 297 antibodies and analyse 26 of these for functional potential. These antibodies target lipooligosaccharide (OCL1), the Oxa-23 protein, and the KL49 capsular polysaccharide. We identify a single monoclonal antibody (mAb1416) recognising KL49 capsular polysaccharide to demonstrate prophylactic in vivo protection against a carbapenem resistant A. baumannii lineage associated with neonatal sepsis mortality in Asia. Our end-to-end approach identifies functional monoclonal antibodies with prophylactic potential against major lineages of drug resistant bacteria accounting for phylogenetic diversity and clinical relevance without existing knowledge of a specific target antigen. Such an approach might be scaled for a additional clinically important bacterial pathogens in the post-antimicrobial era.

 During summer, ammonia emissions in Southeast Asia influence air pollution and cloud formation. Convective transport by the South Asian monsoon carries these pollutant air masses into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS), where they accumulate under anticyclonic flow conditions. This air mass accumulation is thought to contribute to particle formation and the development of the Asian Tropopause Aerosol Layer (ATAL). Despite the known influence of ammonia and particulate ammonium on air pollution, a comprehensive understanding of the ATAL is lacking. In this modelling study, the influence of ammonia on particle formation is assessed with emphasis on the ATAL. We use the EMAC chemistry-climate model, incorporating new particle formation parameterisations derived from experiments at the CERN CLOUD chamber. Our diurnal cycle analysis confirms that new particle formation mainly occurs during daylight, with a 10-fold enhancement in rate. This increase is prominent in the South Asian monsoon UTLS, where deep convection introduces high ammonia levels from the boundary layer, compared to a baseline scenario without ammonia. Our model simulations reveal that this ammonia-driven particle formation and growth contributes to an increase of up to 80% in cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations at cloud-forming heights in the South Asian monsoon region. We find that ammonia profoundly influences the aerosol mass and composition in the ATAL through particle growth, as indicated by an order of magnitude increase in nitrate levels linked to ammonia emissions. However, the effect of ammonia-driven new particle formation on aerosol mass in the ATAL is relatively small. Ammonia emissions enhance the regional aerosol optical depth (AOD) for shortwave solar radiation by up to 70%. We conclude that ammonia has a pronounced effect on the ATAL development, composition, the regional AOD, and CCN concentrations."

 Natural climate solutions are critical actions of ecosystem stewardship to mitigate climate change. However, prioritizing locations and possible actions is challenging. We demonstrate a generalizable approach for identifying potential opportunities for natural climate solutions by creating a spatial hierarchy of land management restrictions. Global forest carbon stocks and flux models were then used to explore forest-based natural climate solutions in the high-carbon density coastal temperate rainforests of western North America. Our results show 13 million hectares are available for action, an area that holds 4,900 ± 640 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent and represents 45% of regional and 0.5% of global aboveground forest carbon stocks. Based on historical trends, a 10% reduction in average annual forest carbon loss through improved forest management and conservation could reduce forest carbon emissions by 9.1 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year, corresponding to 5.2% of the 2030 land-based climate commitments made by the United States and Canada.

 Precipitation variability is forecast to increase under climate change but its impacts on vegetation productivity are complex. Here, we use generalised additive models and remote sensing-derived datasets to quantify the effect of precipitation amount, distribution, and intensity on the gross primary productivity of dry rangelands across sub-Saharan Africa from 2000 to 2019 and differentiate these effects from other variables. We find that total precipitation is the primary driver of productivity, but that more variable rainfall has a small negative effect across vegetation types and rainfall regimes. Temperature and soil nitrogen also have strong effects, especially in drier rangelands. Shrublands and grasslands are more sensitive to environmental variability than savannas. Our findings support a model in which the main constraints on productivity are maintenance of soil moisture and minimisation of plant water stress. This highlights the risks of climate warming and increasing variability for productivity in water-limited grass and shrublands but suggests savannas may have greater resilience in Africa.

 Lithium is key for a clean energy transition but faces sustainability challenges in the global supply.

In the process of global lithium resources shifting from underground reserves to in-use stocks, population and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) influence regions’ lithium endowment and per capita primary consumption, respectively.

 The Tibetan Plateau and surroundings, commonly referred to as the Third Pole region, has the largest ice store outside the Arctic and Antarctic regions. Glacial lakes in the Third Pole region are expanding rapidly as glaciers thin and retreat. The Landsat satellite series is the most popular for mapping glacial lakes, benefiting from long-term archived data and suitable spatial resolution (30 m since ∼1990). However, the homogeneous mapping of high-quality, large-scale, and multi-temporal glacial lake inventories using Landsat imagery relies heavily on visual inspection and manual editing due to mountain shadows, wet ice, frozen lakes, and snow cover on lake boundaries, which is time consuming and labour-intensive. Deep learning methods have been applied to glacial lake extraction in the Third Pole and other regions, yet these methods are either concentrated on small test sites without large-scale applications or in polar regions. In this study, several classical deep convolutional neural networks were evaluated, and the DeepLabv3+ with Mobilenetv3 backbone performed best, with a high accuracy of mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 94.8 % and a low loss error of 0.4 %. The proposed method demonstrated robustness in challenging conditions such as mountain shadows, frozen or partially frozen lakes, wet ice and river contact, all without requiring extensive manual correction. Compared with manual delineation, the model's prediction has a precision rate of 86 %, recall rate of 85 %, and F1-score of 85 %. The area extracted by the model shows a strong correlation with the manual delineation (r2 = 0.97, slope = 0.94) and a high intersection over union (IoU > 0.8) of the predicted areas. A test of large-scale glacial lake mapping based on the developed automated model in 2020 across the Third Pole region shows the robust performance with 29,429 glacial lakes larger than 0.0054 km2 with a total area of ∼1779.9 km2 (including non-glacier-fed lakes). The model trained in this study can be fine-tuned for large-scale mapping of glacial lakes in other mountain regions worldwide."

 Peatlands store enormous amounts of carbon in a peat layer, the formation and preservation of which can only occur under waterlogged conditions. Monitoring peatland moisture conditions is critically important because a decrease in moisture leads to peat oxidation and the release of accumulated carbon back into the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas. Optical remote sensing enables the indirect monitoring of peatland moisture conditions by identifying moisture-driven changes in vegetation spectral signatures. The vegetation of northern peatlands is dominated by Sphagnum mosses, whose spectral signatures are known to be highly sensitive to changes in moisture content. In this study, we tested methods to estimate Sphagnum moisture content from spectral data using seven spectral moisture indices, the OPtical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM) and the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). This study was based on data representing nine Sphagnum species sampled from two habitats in southern boreal peatlands in Finland. Our results showed that both multi- and hyperspectral data can be used to estimate the moisture content of Sphagnum mosses. Nevertheless, the optimal retrieval method depended on habitat characteristics. Using hyperspectral data, we found that: (i) the CWT exhibited superior performance for all studied moss species (RMarg2= 0.72, ICC = 0.40), (ii) the exponential OPTRAM performed best for the mesotrophic species (RMarg2= 0.70, ICC = 0.08), and (iii) the Modified Moisture Stress Index (MMSI) yielded the best results (RMarg2= 0.68, ICC = 0.55) for the ombrotrophic species. Furthermore, we demonstrated that using multispectral data instead of hyperspectral data provides comparable results in moisture estimation when used as input with OPTRAM or Moisture Stress Index (MSI). This approach could lead to new insights into the moisture dynamics in Sphagnum-dominated peatlands over the span of the multispectral satellite era."

 This paper presents a novel approach to tracking ships in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images based on an improved lightweight YOLOv8 Nano (YOLOv8n), specially devised to improve efficiency without compromising accuracy. In our method, we replaced the heavy backbone and neck of YOLOv8 with HGNetv2 and slim-neck, respectively. We also implemented a lightweight decoupling head using EMSConvP. Additionally, we integrated a knowledge distillation module to further enhance detection capabilities. Furthermore, we conducted extensive experiments on the short-time sequence SAR dataset to demonstrate superior accuracy metrics compared to the original YOLOv8n model. Regarding tracking ships in SAR images, we developed a multi-object tracking (MOT) technique called Cascaded-Buffered IoU (C-BIoU). This method enlarges the detection and trajectory matching space by increasing the buffer zone, effectively combining detection and trajectory information from short-time sequence SAR images. The findings reveal that our method significantly reduces the computational complexity, parameters, and model size by up to 54.7 %, 68.4 %, and 68.3 %, respectively, with respect to the original model metrics. As a direct consequence of these reductions, our proposed model demonstrates a remarkable 133.1 % improvement in image processing speed expressed as frames per second (FPS). Moreover, Our C-BIoU method shows outstanding performance in tracking accuracy and efficiency, with superior Higher Order Tracking Accuracy (HOTA), Multiple Object Tracking Precision (MOTP), and Identification F1 score (IDF1) scores of 72.8 %, 87.9 %, and 80.7 %, respectively, compared to existing tracking algorithms. The results from testing on multiple datasets highlight our method’s excellent performance in ship detection and tracking, offering high-speed processing capabilities with an average image processing speed of 81 FPS. In this sense, this method provides reliable real-time monitoring and management of maritime traffic, enhancing situational awareness for maritime operations."

 Penguins play an essential biochemical role in the Antarctic ecosystem, being the study of their dynamics of utmost importance to understand their environment, behaviour and populational trends in the current climate change scenario. In this study, we used multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) along the coast of the chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarcticus) colony of Vapour Col (Deception Island, Antarctica) to map potential sites of biochemical interactions with the surrounding sea water. Several runoff discharge points were identified, where a precise placing of environmental sampling station is suggested. Additionally, UAVs were used in combination with Object Detection Architectures to obtain the chinstrap colony population size. Applying a simulation for clutch initiation dates due to our off-laying peak count, we obtained an estimated range of 13,250 to 22,000 breeding pairs in the 2021/2022 breeding season, also suggesting an alternative approach using chinstrap chicks as proxy to estimate adult numbers. This research shows the utility of UAV-deep learning for environment characterization and wildlife monitoring, providing a solid framework for upcoming studies in the area."

 The Jamuna is a major braided river of Bangladesh and poses enormous challenges related to flooding, erosion, and sedimentation. Effective river management requires an understanding of the Jamuna’s sediment transport dynamics and channel morphology. Yet, developing that understanding is hindered by a lack of topographic data for the river corridor. In this study, the waterline method was applied to a 65 km reach of the Jamuna to derive river channel and floodplain topography above the low water level. The analysis relies on surface water detection from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data, along with in-situ water level observations, to generate river-floodplain DEMs for the years 2016–2019. Morphologic change was assessed through DEMs of difference for sequential years and for the overall study period. A quantitative uncertainty analysis was conducted to characterize errors in the waterline DEMs, vertical change detection, and gross and net volumetric changes. The results indicate that gross annual erosion and accretion volumes have a similar order of magnitude to contemporary estimates of the river’s sediment influx. The study highlights that localized and reach-scale lateral exchange is a key component of the overall sediment budget. Finally, the uncertainty analysis framework provides insight and recommendations for how errors can be assessed and reduced in future waterline applications."

As atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide doubled from about 410 to about 860 ppm (parts per million) in the latest Permian, the meridional overturning circulation collapsed, the Hadley cell contracted, and El Niños intensified.

The biological activity persisted after HIPVs had been oxidized to form SOAs, which was indicated by receivers displaying enhanced photosynthesis, primed volatile defenses, and reduced weevil damage.
