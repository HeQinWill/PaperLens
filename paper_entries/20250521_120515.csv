10.1088/1748-9326/add174,True,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文探讨了热带地区水汽对地表辐射冷却的间接影响，以及这种影响对季风前热应力的意义。研究发现，在高湿度时期，水汽实际上会通过增加低层云量，产生地表冷却效应，这与水汽通常被认为是温室气体的观点相反。研究使用了再分析数据和卫星数据来分析水汽、云量和地表温度之间的关系。研究结果表明，这种水汽的间接辐射效应对热带地区的热应力具有重要影响，尤其是在季风前。未来的气候变暖背景下，这种效应的演变值得进一步研究。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它利用卫星观测数据分析大气成分（水汽和云）及其辐射效应，并应用于理解和预测地表环境变化（热应力）。,"['water vapor', 'cloud cover', 'radiative forcing', 'satellite data', 'ITCZ', 'Hadley cell', 'heat stress', 'pre-monsoon', 'atmospheric composition']",Jaya Khanna;Karan,An indirect radiative surface-cooling due to water vapor in the tropics and its implications for pre-monsoonal heat stress,"Severe pre-monsoonal heat stress has become a routine occurrence in several tropical regions. Motivated by the surmounting evidence that high ambient humidity worsens the perception of heat during these events, we analyse the general, net radiative impacts of humidity on pre-monsoonal surface temperatures using reanalysis and satellite data. Surprisingly, we find that there exists an indirect, radiative surface-cooling effect of water vapor within extended regions in the tropics during periods of high ambient humidity relative to drier periods in the pre-monsoonal season. This observation is contrary to the strong greenhouse effect generally associated with water vapor. We show that this radiative surface-cooling is associated with a previously unreported large positive correlation between lower tropospheric humidity and cloud cover in these regions bordering the ITCZ. These clouds are predominantly low-level and altocumuli, known to have a negative surface-radiative forcing, possibly causing the surface-cooling observed during periods of high ambient humidity. Therefore, periods of lower ambient humidity—or equivalently lesser low-to-mid-level cloud cover—lead to strong surface warming. We find that these pan-tropical regions, where heat stress is negatively correlated with ambient humidity, border the ITCZ and are co-located with the horizontal branch of the Hadley cell, moving north-to-south with the seasonal cycle. Hence, this indirect negative radiative effect of water vapor is particularly relevant for heat stress during the pre-monsoons. We demonstrate this with case studies of some recent major heat waves over the Indian sub-continent when this indirect water vapor effect is found dominantly active throughout the season and in its warming phase during the period of the heat wave. The evolution of this indirect, radiative effect of water vapor, under future climate warming, needs further investigation, considering its crucial importance for heat stress in the tropics."

However, the extent of the European ones is relatively unknown, despite studies and evidence of their long existence. This is the first comparative study on the CLOIs at a European regional scale. This study focuses on the Alps as defined by the Alpine Convention, and presents the first comprehensive review of data, and status of CLOIs across and within 6 alpine countries: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The aim is to assess (i) their historical evolution, (ii) their institutional arrangements and governance characteristics, and (iii) their numbers, surface, and land uses. To carry out this analysis, we used secondary data from official statistics, surveys, scientific and grey literature, legislation, and bylaws for each country and each region. The results show that CLOIs emerged in the Middle Ages and went through key changes in the 19th century, primarily due to Napoleon’s influence in reorganising public administration structures, and post-World War II centralization processes, especially in eastern European countries. In total, we accounted for between 5785 and 11 063 CLOIs, distributed across 32 types in the 6 countries; among which, CLOIs with full property rights and membership based on farmstead ownership are the most frequent. The main land use for Alpine CLOIs is forest followed by pasturelands. CLOIs holding agricultural land, such as cropland, was instead reported for only one country and was negligible. In this review we have identified and highlighted several scientific gaps for future but urgent research on Alpine commons. This review depicts the need for more systematic and cross-country data collection, which could encourage networking and innovation, stakeholder engagement, and CLOIs’ recognition in contributing to the sustainable development goals."

GWPs are widely used to compare emissions of different greenhouse gases and to compute CO2 equivalent emissions as reported by governments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The GWP of any gas x is the absolute GWP of gas x Absolute and relative Global Warming Potential (AGWPx) divided by AGWP of CO2. Ideally, AGWP and GWPx would be independent of atmospheric CO2 and climate. However, AGWP , and, in turn, GWPx change under rising atmospheric CO2 and global warming, affecting the emission reporting under the UNFCCC. Here, we apply perturbed parameter ensemble simulations, constrained in a Bayesian approach by observational data, to investigate how AGWP and IRF vary under different atmospheric background CO2 levels (CO ). We provide analytical formulations to compute AGWP and IRF for CO2, ocean and land carbon uptake, global mean surface air temperature, steric sea level, and ocean heat content, and to adjust these metrics to different CO . AGWP , given by the time-integrated response in CO2 at year 100 multiplied by its radiative efficiency, is 101.8(±13.5) 10−15 yr W m−2 kg-CO for CO = 425 ppm and decreases by 7% for CO = 500 ppm. The decrease is driven by a decrease in the radiative efficiency of CO2, partly canceled by a concomitant increase of IRF due to muted ocean and land carbon uptake under higher CO2 levels. We recommend regularly adjusting AGWP and, in turn, GWPs of long-lived gases to contemporary atmospheric CO2 and climate."

We aimed to investigate the association between greenness and PD prevalence in China. This cross-sectional study utilized data from the 2020 wave of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), involving a sample of 17 029 individuals. PD diagnoses were ascertained through medical professionals and records in questionnaires. To assess greenness exposure, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was calculated as annual population-weighted for 2020 (NDVI2020) and a two-year average population-weighted for the period of 2019 and 2020 (NDVI2019−2020), respectively. Logistic regression models were employed to analyze the association between greenness and PD prevalence at city scale, and stratified analyses were further performed to identify potential modifiers of the association between greenness and PD prevalence. In the fully-adjusted models, a 0.1 increase in NDVI2020 was associated with 14.0% [odds ratio (OR) 0.860, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.750, 0.987] lower odds of prevalent PD. Similarly, a 0.1 increase in NDVI2019−2020 was associated with 13.9% (OR 0.861, 95% CI: 0.744, 0.997) reduction in the odds of prevalent PD. This conclusion remained robust in the sensitivity analyses. Moreover, significant protective effects of greenness on PD prevalence were identified among females, the elderly, those living alone, and those with healthier habits. This national cross-sectional study found that exposure to higher greenness was associated with reduced odds of prevalent PD. Greenness may serve as a readily accessible environmental intervention for lowering prevalent PD in the future."

In contrast, this study seeks to provide a statistical analysis of the resilience mechanisms that human societies have historically employed to adapt to and mitigate adverse environmental conditions. Agricultural development, as a crucial component of social resilience, has played a pivotal role in enabling societies to absorb climate-induced subsistence pressures. We systematically examine how introducing American crops mitigated the relationship between climatic extremes—specifically floods and droughts—and Malthusian catastrophes such as famines and wars during the Ming and Qing Dynasties in China. By collecting and analyzing records of four high-yield American crops—maize, peanuts, sweet potatoes, and potatoes—from 3071 local chronicles across 236 prefectures, we employ the spatial Durbin model to evaluate both the direct and spillover effects of these crops during hydroclimatic extremes quantitatively to see how they contributed to social resilience. Our statistical results indicate that introducing these American crops had significant mitigating effects on Malthusian catastrophes during climate extremes, with varying impacts among the different crops. Maize and peanuts were particularly effective in reducing wars during floods, while peanuts, sweet potatoes, and potatoes tended to alleviate famines during droughts. Regional comparison reveals that these catastrophe-mitigating effects were more pronounced in the south-western mountainous zone and that spatial spillover effects were more significant in the central-eastern rice cultivation zone. These findings underscore the importance of agricultural development in enhancing social resilience to climatic extremes. By highlighting the regionally varying catastrophe-mitigating effects of specific crops, our study provides valuable insights into the adaptive capacities of human societies to climate variability. This contributes to a more nuanced and context-sensitive understanding of the human-environment nexus."

This study found that the interannual variations of the warm extremes over the Indochina Peninsula during boreal summer can be affected by the IOT. When the positive IOT events occur, two cross-equatorial airflows are induced over the eastern and western tropical Indian Ocean, reinforcing the anomalous warm-humid westerly wind over the northern Indian Ocean. The water vapor convergence is strengthened and the anomalous middle-lower level negative geopotential height is formed over the Indochina Peninsula, leading to the local enhanced ascending motion and surplus precipitation, strongly supported by both observations and numerical simulation. These circulation anomalies favor the reduction of the local surface temperatures through increasing the cloud cover and hindering the downward solar radiation, further declining the warm extremes days. Improving to understand the warm extreme variations over the Indochina Peninsula and its impact factors is of great significance for local industrial development, agricultural production and human health."

Leveraging machine learning tools to forecast algal blooms is crucial and promising for bloom management in various water systems. Notably, previous findings are site-specific, especially regarding the impacts of forecasting periods and important input features. However, there is a significant research gap in the application of machine learning for predicting algal blooms in the Great Lakes, the world’s largest freshwater system. Thus, based on the measurements of 16 water quality parameters from 2012 to 2022, the author established the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model to forecast chlorophyll a (Chl a, a proxy for algal biomass) concentration for 1–7 d in Lake Erie. The XGBoost model performance is quite satisfactory, with the lowest MSE of 10.94 and the highest R2 of 0.99 for the 1 d forecast and an MSE of 83.90 and an R2 of 0.90 for the 7 d forecast. Once trained, the model takes only a few seconds to run on an Intel Core i7 personal laptop. Based on Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) feature importance, water depth (Depth) and water temperature (Temp), are more important input features for the 7 d forecasting model than the well-recognized phosphorus and nitrogen nutrients, including particulate organic nitrogen (PON), soluble reactive phosphorous (SRP), nitrate + nitrite (NN), and total phosphorous (TP). Achieving relatively high accuracy for the 7 d forecast, with an R2 of 0.83 and an MSE of 144.40, is possible by using only the top six most important input features: initial Chl a, Depth, Temp, PON, SRP, and NN, based on SHAP feature importance results. These findings highlight the accuracy and efficiency of the developed XGBoost model to predict Chl a in the world’s largest freshwater system. The model can enhance algal bloom monitoring efficiency through early detection and key predictive features, supporting an early warning system for timely interventions, while also informing policy decisions and optimizing resource allocation."

Here we aimed to identify key drivers of mosquito abundance in different urban informal settlements to inform upgrading programs. We developed a causal framework of mosquito risk and tested it in two distinct geographic settings: Makassar, Indonesia and Suva, Fiji. Using longitudinal mosquito trapping surveys in 24 informal settlements between 2018 and 2024 (totalling 1534 successful trap sets in Makassar and 1216 in Suva), we fitted causal models to infer the relationships between climatic, environmental and socioeconomic drivers and the abundance of two dominant mosquito species: Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus. Water supply and access, and variation in temperature and precipitation were key drivers of mosquito abundance in both informal settlement locations, but the direction of effects differed between vector species. Piped water supply in a settlement reduced the abundance of the dengue vector, Ae. aegypti but increased the abundance of Cx. quinquefasciatus. Higher temperature and precipitation were associated with more Ae. aegypti in both geographic locations. By identifying the pathways through which changes in informal settlement environments are likely to alter mosquito risk we provide essential information to guide upgrading and resilience programs."

Persistent knowledge gaps regarding key ignition drivers and their nonlinear interdependencies hinder the development of targeted prevention strategies and robust early warning systems. To address these limitations, we compiled a statewide dataset spanning 2010–2020 comprising 4775 LIWs and employed an optimized repeated-random undersampling strategy to mitigate class imbalance. Using this dataset, we developed an eXtreme gradient boosting-based machine learning model that integrates meteorological, soil, vegetative, lightning, topographic, and human activity variables to predict LIW probability. The most accurate classifier achieved an out-of-sample prediction accuracy of 85.81%, outperforming the fire weather index and methodologies of random forests and logistic regression. Key drivers of ignition were identified as higher lightning frequency, elevated temperatures, and lower fuel moisture content. Spatial analysis revealed LIW clustering in needleleaf forests of eastern Texas, where maximum fuel loading (indicated by normalized difference vegetation index) and lightning density interacted to create ignition-prone conditions."

The chemical sink of atmospheric methane is not constant but depends on the temperature and on the abundance of its reaction partners. In this study, we use a global chemistry–climate model to assess the feedback of atmospheric methane induced by changes in the chemical sink in a warming climate and its implications for the chemical composition and the surface air temperature change. 
 The chemical sink of atmospheric methane (CH4) depends on the temperature and on the chemical composition. Here, we assess the feedback on atmospheric CH4 induced by changes in the chemical sink in a warming climate using a CH4-emission-flux-driven set-up of the chemistry–climate model EMAC (ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry), in which the chemical feedback of CH4 mixing ratios can evolve explicitly. We perform idealized perturbation simulations driven either by increased carbon dioxide (CO2) mixing ratios or by increased CH4 emission fluxes. The CH4 emission flux perturbation leads to a large increase of CH4 mixing ratios. Remarkably, the factor by which the CH4 mixing ratio increases is larger than the increase factor of the emission flux, because the atmospheric lifetime of CH4 is extended.In contrast, the individual effect of the global surface air temperature (GSAT) increase is to shorten the CH4 lifetime, which results in a significant reduction of CH4 mixing ratios in our set-up. The corresponding radiative feedback is estimated at −0.041 and −0.089 W m−2 K−1 for the CO2 and CH4 perturbation, respectively. The explicit response of CH4 mixing ratios leads to secondary feedbacks on the hydroxyl radical (OH) and ozone (O3). Firstly, the OH response includes the CH4–OH feedback, which enhances the CH4 lifetime change, and, secondly, the formation of tropospheric O3 is reduced. Our CH4 perturbation induces the same response of GSAT per effective radiative forcing (ERF) as the CO2 perturbation, which supports the applicability of the ERF framework for CH4."

All 12 members of the 12 km ensemble were corrected using quantile mapping and a change-preserving variant. Both methods effectively reduce biases in multiple statistics while maintaining projected climatic changes. We provide guidance on using the bias-corrected datasets for climate change impact assessment. 
 The United Kingdom Climate Projections 2018 (UKCP18) regional climate model (RCM) 12 km regional perturbed physics ensemble (UKCP18-RCM-PPE) is one of the three strands of the latest set of UK national climate projections produced by the UK Met Office. It has been widely adopted in climate impact assessment. In this study, we report biases in the raw UKCP18-RCM simulations that are significant and are likely to deteriorate impact assessments if they are not adjusted. Two methods were used to bias-correct UKCP18-RCM: non-parametric quantile mapping using empirical quantiles and a variant developed for the third phase of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) designed to preserve the climate change signal. Specifically, daily temperature and precipitation simulations for 1981 to 2080 were adjusted for the 12 ensemble members. Potential evapotranspiration was also estimated over the same period using the Penman–Monteith formulation and then bias-corrected using the latter method. Both methods successfully corrected biases in a range of daily temperature, precipitation, and potential evapotranspiration metrics and reduced biases in multi-day precipitation metrics to a lesser degree. An exploratory analysis of the projected future changes confirms the expectation of wetter, warmer winters and hotter, drier summers and shows uneven changes in different parts of the distributions of both temperature and precipitation. Both bias-correction methods preserved the climate change signal almost equally well, as well as the spread among the projected changes. The change factor method was used as a benchmark for precipitation, and we show that it fails to capture changes in a range of variables, making it inadequate for most impact assessments. By comparing the differences between the two bias-correction methods and within the 12 ensemble members, we show that the uncertainty in future precipitation and temperature changes stemming from the climate model parameterization far outweighs the uncertainty introduced by selecting one of these two bias-correction methods. We conclude by providing guidance on the use of the bias-corrected datasets.

Outperforming the Gridded Livestock of the World (GLW), it achieves higher spatial accuracy (R²>0.85) and makes up for the lack of spatial information of large livestock such as camels in GLW. The results enabled precise spatial characterization of pastoral patterns. 
 Accurate quantification of the geospatial distribution of livestock in pastoral regions is important for assessing and maintaining grassland ecological security and sustainable development. Statistical livestock data based on static and macro-level administrative units cannot characterize the fine-scale distribution of livestock across mobile geographic spaces. This study proposed a livestock spatial mapping framework that combined livestock inventory statistics of soum/banner counties with multi-source data (e.g., land cover, population, topography, and climate, etc.) using the Random Forest model (RF). A series of high-resolution gridded spatial distribution datasets of total livestock, sheep & goats, and large livestock (cattle, horses, and camels) densities at five-year intervals were obtained for the Mongolian Plateau from 2000 to 2020. The fitting accuracy of this dataset with statistical data (R²>0.85) is significantly better than that of the existing Gridded Livestock of the World (GLW) series dataset, and the spatial distribution is more accurate and detailed. At the same time, it also compensates for the lack of spatial information of large livestock such as camels in the GLW. This approach enables coarse-grained administrative division data transforming into high-resolution spatial gridded data, by solving the key problems of low spatial resolution, missing local details, and the spatial fusion of different data sources. Based on the acquired high-precision spatial distribution data of livestock density, it can be fused and analyzed with other geographic environment data, which is of great value for the ecological environment protection of grassland in nomadic grassland areas.

This study presents a particle-swarm-optimizer-based toolbox for marine ecosystem models, compatible with the Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models, thus enhancing its reusability. Applied to the Sylt ecosystem, the toolbox effectively (1) identified multiple parameter sets that matched observations well, providing different insights into ecosystem dynamics, and (2) optimized model complexity. 
 Mathematical models are an invaluable tool for understanding marine ecosystems. The performance of these models is often highly dependent on their parameters. Traditionally, refining these models has involved a time-consuming trial-and-error approach to identify model parameter values that are able to reproduce observations well. However, as ecosystem models become more complex, this approach becomes impractical. With advances in computing power, optimization techniques have emerged as a viable alternative. Nevertheless, these techniques often exhibit model-specific customization, which limits their broader application. In this study, we present a parameterization toolbox based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, implemented within the Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models (FABM). This implementation encapsulates the optimizer – that is, the toolbox itself – as a reusable component, enabling its integration across multiple models within the framework and thus making it more accessible to the community. The effectiveness of the PSO toolbox is showcased through its application in a 1D physical–biogeochemical model (GOTM–ECOSMO E2E), which successfully parameterized the Sylt–Rømø Bight ecosystem. The toolbox was able to define optimal values for most of the tuned parameters and to suggest potential ranges for poorly constrained parameters. In addition, the toolbox uncovers a number of parameter sets with notable differences in some parameter values but leading to only minor variations in biomass and fluxes. Furthermore, by experimenting with optimization models of varying complexity, the toolbox was able to define an optimal model for the Sylt–Rømø Bight."

This study investigated the bioconcentration factors (BCFs) of 18 emerging and legacy PFASs using zebrafish in a flow-through exposure system and constructed a robust BCF prediction model to address the data gaps associated with numerous novel PFASs. Experimental results indicated that perfluoro(3,5,7,9,11-pentaoxadodecanoic) acid (PFO5DoDA) and perfluoro-2,5-dimethyl-3,6-dioxanonanoic acid (C9 HFPO-TA) exhibited higher bioaccumulation potential than perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). A multimodal feature-fused directed message passing neural network (FF-DMPNN) model was constructed, integrating molecular graph representations, physicochemical descriptors, and bioassay data reflecting absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion characteristics. The FF-DMPNN model demonstrated superior predictive performance compared to conventional machine learning approaches by providing a more complete representation of molecular structures and physicochemical properties, achieving higher accuracy (R2 = 0.742) and robustness in predicting BCF values for PFASs. Application of the model to a comprehensive PFAS database identified 2.45% of chemicals as bioaccumulative, highlighting the need for regulatory attention. Overall, this study provides critical insights into the bioconcentration risks associated with PFASs and offers a reliable framework for prioritizing regulatory actions for these emerging contaminants, addressing a pressing need for their effective environmental management."

The presence of OPEs in human blood suggests direct interactions with hematological components, which may compromise hemostatic balance and lead to adverse health outcomes. Despite the critical role of hemostatic balance in maintaining blood stability, the effects of OPEs on this system remain poorly understood. This investigation was undertaken to delineate the effects and potential mechanisms of OPEs that modulate hemostasis, utilizing in silico approach and high-throughput in vitro investigation. We analyzed 85 environmentally prevalent OPEs for their structural descriptors and affinity for proteins essential to hemostatic function. The multiple linear regression implicated aryl-OPEs, distinguished by their benzene ring scaffold, as potent disruptors of hemostatic balance. This analysis result was rigorously validated through the in vitro hemostatic balance assays. Further investigation through network toxicology, artificial intelligence (α-Fold) algorithms, and an agonist cotreatment assay revealed proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) as a key mediator of aryl-OPEs induced hemostatic disruption. By integrating in vitro experimental insights with in vivo exposure data, we concluded that specific aryl-OPEs, such as bisphenol a bis (diphenyl phosphate) (BDP) and cresyl diphenyl phosphate (CDP), pose a moderate risk to the hemostatic balance of the general population. Our findings not only contribute to the prioritization of OPEs risk management but also establish a methodology for assessing the hematological toxicity of emerging pollutants."

However, estimating infant-specific dust ingestion rates remains challenging. One proposed approach to improve estimates is the identification of novel organic tracers. To help address this challenge, we conducted a nontargeted analysis on dust samples collected from waking and sleeping rooms in infants’ homes (n = 30) in the greater Baltimore, MD region, as part of the INnovations to Generate Estimates of children’s Soil/dust inTake (INGEST) Study. By leveraging publicly available data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), including commercial product compositions and chemical functional uses, we showed that many compounds in dust were associated with personal care, cleaning, and consumer products. Most features were detected in both collection rooms in at least one home, but only 16.3% of features were detected in both rooms in all of the homes. Additionally, the relative abundance of features across rooms (i.e., room ratios) within and between homes varied substantially. The high intra- and interhome variability, possibly due to differences in consumer practices among inhabitants, may pose challenges with identifying and implementing an organic tracer for estimating children’s dust ingestion rates and need to be rigorously characterized for any candidate."

Exposure to NO2 contributes to asthma development, but quantitative analysis of pediatric asthma burden attributable to NOx emissions is rarely performed due to a lack of suitable models. This paper describes a new model, Marginal Asthma prevalence from NOx Emissions (MANE), which assesses the pediatric asthma burden from NOx emissions and its distribution across race/ethnicities. We find that emissions in more densely populated areas cause a larger number of pediatric asthma cases and tend to disproportionately impact minority communities. We applied our model to assess the pediatric asthma burden from sources of NOx, finding that diesel heavy-duty vehicles are responsible for approximately 4% of all pediatric asthma cases in the U.S. Additionally, we find that all source sectors considered disproportionately impact children of color, with 65–100% higher per-capita asthma rates in Black children compared to white non-Hispanic children. Finally, we find that emissions in a limited number of urban areas are responsible for a large share of asthma cases, suggesting that local, targeted restrictions on NOx emissions may provide great public health benefit nationally."

This study examines water, soil, sediment, and ash samples from the North and Middle Fork regions of the upper Chena River watershed, which faces recurring annual wildfires. Polyaromatic hydrocarbon (∑PAH) concentrations range from 41.1 to 1455.3 ng/L in water and 14.5 to 63.2 μg/kg in sediments, topsoil, and ash. Water primarily contains phenanthrene and trace levels of pyrene and fluorene, while solid samples exhibit elevated levels of naphthalene and phenanthrene, along with trace amounts of acenaphthene, anthracene, and fluorene. Runoff and terrain slope patterns derived from topographical analyses of the Chena River watershed might explain some of these elevated PAH levels, which surpass those found in other wildfire-affected watersheds worldwide. These findings underscore the risks to aquatic ecosystems, as PAHs are toxic, bioaccumulative, and can lead to the formation of harmful disinfection byproducts.

Eutrophication-induced deposition of organic matter leads to elevated methanogenesis and sulfate reduction, thereby increasing the concentrations of methane and toxic sulfide, respectively. However, the effects of sulfide stress on the anaerobic methanotrophic biofilter have not been well explored. Here, we show how an enrichment culture dominated by the freshwater anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaeon “Candidatus (Ca.) Methanoperedens” responds to short-term and long-term exposure to sulfide in a bioreactor. The methane-oxidizing activity decreased to 45% and 20% but partially recovered to 70% and 30% within 5 days after short- and long-term sulfide exposure, respectively. Metagenomics indicated that “Ca. Methanoperedens” remained dominant in the enrichment throughout the entire experiment. The first short-term sulfide pulse led to increased expression of genes encoding for sulfide detoxification by low abundant community members, whereas long-term exposure resulted in upregulation of “Ca. Methanoperedens” genes encoding sulfite reductases of group III (Dsr-LP). “Ca. Methanoperedens” consumed polyhydroxyalkanoates during long-term sulfide exposure, possibly to aid in stress adaptation.

The targets related to 6PPDQ and liver injury were obtained from public databases, and a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to identify key targets. Meanwhile, molecular docking was performed to assess 6PPDQ’s binding affinity to core proteins. Transcriptomics and differential gene expression analysis were performed on the livers of Kunming mice exposed to 4 mg/kg 6PPDQ to explore transcriptomic alterations, while metabolomic profiling identified disrupted metabolic pathways.

However, quantifying the seasonal iron cycle is challenging, as observations of bioavailable, dissolved iron (DFe) from individual campaigns rarely span a full seasonal cycle. Here, we present a composite seasonal cycle constructed from 27 years of DFe observations at the subantarctic Southern Ocean Time Series (SOTS) south of Australia. Iron measurements are paired with time series data to explain the iron cycle contextualized to broader Southern Ocean biogeochemistry. Three distinct phases were revealed with clear coupling between iron and productivity in the first two phases. In the first phase, light limitation initially controls spring to summer primary production with shoaling of the mixed layer, accounting for around half of annual net community production (ANCP). In the second phase and remaining half of ANCP, rapid biomass increases and near‐complete drawdown of DFe drive iron limitation, evidenced by maximum fluorescence‐to‐chlorophyll ratios. A subset of this period covering a third of ANCP exhibits a mean Fe:C uptake ratio of 31.08 ± 8.88 μmol:mol. During the third phase, iron is weakly coupled to productivity as the system transitions to net heterotrophy and biomass declines despite increased Fe supply associated with the east Australian current system. Together, 27 years of continuous monitoring draws a comprehensive picture of how and when iron fuels subantarctic productivity, providing a critical baseline for model validation and continued monitoring in a rapidly changing climate."

Their ruptures were consistently initiated in the same patch, and most events exhibited double ruptures after the Tohoku earthquake, transitioning to single ruptures over time, in a surprisingly systematic manner.

However, the physical process of dehydration embrittlement remains unclear due to the complex and poorly constrained interactions between reaction progress, fluid pressure evolution, and deformation. Here we aim to quantify these interactions during antigorite dehydration with 2D hydro‐mechanical‐chemical numerical modeling and explore whether the reaction causes stress perturbations potentially leading to earthquakes. Negative total volume change during the reaction acts toward the relaxation of fluid overpressures, decreasing the chance of embrittlement. The reaction zone is the least likely to fracture due to reaction‐induced weakening and the locally larger increase of total pressure compared to fluid pressure. However, weakening also generates fluid overpressure zones and may induce strain localization/runaway processes potentially leading to brittle failure. Our results also imply that antigorite dehydration could be both the cause and effect of fast deformation in subducted slabs."

Taking a wintertime O3 surge episode over the Sichuan Basin (SCB) as an example, we find SI contribute 47.8% to near‐surface O3 levels and reveal the underlying mechanisms. Tropopause folding nearly extends to the deep atmospheric boundary layer over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) due to topographic forcing, driving stratospheric O3 penetration into the TP's near‐surface. The intruded O3 is subsequently transported into the downstream SCB by strong downdrafts along the TP's leeward slope. Interestingly, the mountain‐plains solenoid between the TP and the SCB strengthens the downward intrusions of O3 during both daytime and nighttime, further amplifying the contribution of SI to the SCB's near‐surface O3 levels. This unique mechanism of O3 surges could provide new insights for the forecast of unexpected nocturnal high‐O3 episodes."

Here, the authors use the natural reactive oxygen species gradient in the tumour microenvironment to target delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing plasmids using reactive oxygen species responsive nanomotors for metabolic disruption and immunotherapy. 
 While gene-editing-based tumor therapy holds promise, conventional passive-diffusion vectors face limited penetration in dense solid tumors. Here, we developed a ROS-driven gene editing nanomotor (RDN@PL), which takes hemin as the core and encapsulates CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids targeting LDHA (A glycolysis key enzyme). In tumor microenvironments, RDN@PL consumes extracellular ROS to fuel self-diffusiophoresis, achieving higher intratumoral accumulation than passive particles. Upon internalization, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) degrades RDN@PL, releasing CO and plasmids. LDHA knockout suppresses glycolysis while CO elevates mitochondrial ROS, which triggers apoptosis by disrupting metabolism and enhancing immunity. Simultaneously, extracellular ROS depletion by non-internalized nanomotors reverses immunogenic cell death (ICD) inhibition, enhancing CD8+ T cell infiltration in tumor. The Janus nanomotor enables extracellular ROS scavenging and intracellular ROS increment via HO-1-responsive cargo release and gene editing. This multi-level intervention strategy demonstrates 93.9 % tumor growth suppression in solid tumor models, providing a blueprint for engineering intelligent nanovesicles in precision oncology.

 Fluorine-containing compounds hold pivotal importance in life sciences. Recent decades have witnessed significant research efforts toward developing practical fluorination methods. Radical-mediated decarboxylative fluorination has proven to be a robust approach for incorporating diverse monofluoroalkyl groups. Here we show a radical-mediated modular synthesis of alkyl fluorides through a decarboxylative-desulfonylative gem-difunctionalization under mild photochemical conditions. The multi-component reaction proceeds in a controlled sequence of radical decarboxylation and heteroaryl migration, governed by radical polarity and kinetic effects, resulting in a wide range of valuable alkyl fluorides. Two C-C bonds and one C-F bond are concurrently formed throughout the process. Both styrenes and aliphatic alkenes serve as suitable substrates for this transformation. Furthermore, this method can be applied to the incorporation of a monofluoroalkyl moiety into complex alkene molecules at a late stage.

 The unprecedented water vapor amount (WV, 150–160 Tg) injected by the 2022 eruption of Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai not only directly cooled the stratosphere, but also facilitated the formation and growth of sulfate particles, indirectly heating it. Here, we developed analytical models constrained by satellite observations to quantify these contrasting roles of WV in stratospheric temperature perturbations. Our analysis revealed that condensation and nucleation processes facilitated by abundant WV accounted for ~90% of the observed particle radius growth, from 0.1–0.2 µm to 0.35–0.45 µm. Despite increased aerosol extinction due to particle growth, a cooling of up to −4 K was observed in the mid-stratosphere, persisting for over a year since February, with over 60% attributed to WV radiative cooling. Conversely, in the lower stratosphere, ~50% of the observed 1–2 K warming was attributed to the radiative heating of large particles that formed in upper layers and settled down gravitationally."

 Forecasting catastrophic failures that threaten life and property remains a formidable challenge. A major hurdle lies in the intermittent rupture dynamics of heterogeneous materials. This erratic pattern challenges conventional time-to-failure predictive models, which typically assume a smooth, monotonic power law acceleration. Here, we propose a unified failure model based on a log-periodic power law that encapsulates the intermittent acceleration-deceleration sequences within a single framework. We validate this unified model using a global dataset of 109 historical geohazard events including landslides, rockbursts, glacier breakoffs, and volcanic eruptions, spanning a century and across seven continents. We show that our model significantly outperforms the conventional approach, offering a robust and versatile framework for describing the complex rupture behavior of diverse geomaterials such as rock, soil, and ice at the site scale. This unified perspective not only broadens the model’s applicability across diverse geohazards but also highlights its potential to enhance early warning systems.

 The response of the hyperarid Pacific coast of South America to greenhouse warming remains highly uncertain but has profound implications for the future habitability of the region. Here, we present the first paleobotanical study documenting the Peruvian Desert’s response to the Late Miocene greenhouse climate, when radiative forcing was comparable to 21st century projections. Fossil leaves, wood, and pollen from the Pisco Formation lagerstätte indicate a diverse dry forest biome where an absolute desert is observed today. Rainfall at 8–6 Ma is estimated to have been three times higher than today, possibly due to a warmer Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean or to more frequent El Niño events. Our results suggest that the impacts of tropical climate dynamical changes on ecosystems of the Pacific South American coast under greenhouse warming conditions may outweigh those of heat and evaporation, potentially enabling vegetation expansion, biome transformations, and enhanced habitability in this region.

 Mass loss from ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica has quadrupled since the 1990s and now represents the dominant source of global mean sea-level rise from the cryosphere. This has raised concerns about their future stability and focussed attention on the global mean temperature thresholds that might trigger more rapid retreat or even collapse, with renewed calls to meet the more ambitious target of the Paris Climate Agreement and limit warming to +1.5 °C above pre-industrial. Here we synthesise multiple lines of evidence to show that +1.5 °C is too high and that even current climate forcing (+1.2 °C), if sustained, is likely to generate several metres of sea-level rise over the coming centuries, causing extensive loss and damage to coastal populations and challenging the implementation of adaptation measures. To avoid this requires a global mean temperature that is cooler than present and which we hypothesise to be closer to +1 °C above pre-industrial, possibly even lower, but further work is urgently required to more precisely determine a ‘safe limit’ for ice sheets. Warming of +1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels is too high for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, and even the current climate forcing of +1.2 °C is likely to lead to several meters of sea-level rise, meaning that only a return to +1 °C or lower will avoid extensive loss and damage to coastal populations, according to a synthesis of recent evidence."

 In this study, 8 nitro-PAHs (nPAHs) and 10 oxy-PAHs (oPAHs) were analyzed in the PM 2.5 samples collected from four sites of Northeast Asia during the winter season to evaluate their spatial distribution. The total mean concentrations of nPAHs and oPAHs were extremely high in Ulaanbaatar (UB) as 318.80 ± 176.35 ng/m3. In Beijing (BJ), Seoul (SE), and Seosan (SS), the concentrations were similar at 25.59 ± 13.25 ng/m3, 15.51 ± 3.12 ng/m3, and 25.14 ± 21.98 ng/m3, respectively. oPAHs concentrations were higher than nPAHs at all sampling sites, being 107 times higher in UB and approximately 22 times higher at the other three sites. The distribution of individual compounds were similar in BJ, SE, and SS, while, UB showed distinct characteristics. To assess which factor is more significant between the primary emission and secondary formation of nPAHs and oPAHs, correlation and PMF analyses with the other air pollutants were conducted. Although the main factor for determining of nPAHs and oPAHs was different by location, secondary formation (54.5 %) and vehicle exhaust (34.3 %) were the main factors to occur nPAHs in the atmosphere, while oPAHs were mainly determined by solid coal combustion (44.2 %) and vehicle exhaust (39.1 %). In particular, secondary formation by heterogeneous reaction appeared to be a significant factor for nPAHs in SE. In the Monte Carlo simulations for Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk (ILCR) assessment, males had higher average ILCR values than females, especially in the 0–1 age group. Excluding the male 0–1 age group in UB, all other groups were found to be within acceptable levels (ILCR <1.0 E−6) of carcinogenic risk. The cancer risk in UB was significantly driven by the high concentrations of parent PAHs, rather than oPAHs and nPAHs."

 Assessing particle exposure in the human respiratory tract (HRT) is critical for understanding its health risks. Hygroscopicity is a key characteristic that influences particle deposition by changing particle size in the human respiratory tract. In this study, the daily deposited particle doses and rates of submicron particles in different regions of the HRT, as well as the total HRT considering hygroscopic growth, were comprehensively evaluated using the Multiple-Path Particle Dosimetry model (MPPD) and size-resolved particle hygroscopicity measurements obtained with the Volatility Hygroscopicity Tandem Differential Mobility Analyzer (VH–TDMA) in urban Beijing. Taking particle hygroscopicity into account, the deposition fractions (DFs) of particles smaller than 300 nm were 25.4 % lower than those of dry particles, while the DFs of particles larger than 300 nm increased by 23.0 %. The results indicated that the daily deposited particle number dose (DPNd), mass dose (DPMd) and surface area dose (DPSd) were predominantly deposited in the pulmonary (P) region, accounting for 53 %, 47 %, and 54 % of total respiratory tract deposition, respectively. Ultrafine particles (UFPs; <100 nm) dominated the daily DPNd, accounting for 86.4 %, 94.4 %, and 76.8 % of the total DPNd during the whole sampling period, new particle formation (NPF) days, and pollution period, respectively. In contrast, accumulation mode particles were the primary contributors to both DPMd and DPSd. From the perspective of diurnal variation, the highest deposited particle number rate (DPNr) in the HRT occurred during the daytime and evening rush hours, with peak values observed at 10:00 and 18:00, reaching 3.5 × 109 and 4.5 × 109 particles h−1, respectively. The peak times for the deposited particle mass rate (DPMr) and surface area rate (DPSr) varied across different periods."

 With rapid urbanization, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region has experienced intensifying greenhouse effects due to increases in global carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. Therefore, studying the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of CO2 concentrations and understanding the causes of regional climate change have become crucial. Although previous studies have focused on calculating regional carbon sources and sinks, explicit and directly interpretable analyses targeting CO₂ concentrations per se remain limited. Based on multi-source satellite data, this study systematically analyzed changes in the spatiotemporal distribution of CO2 concentrations in the BTH region and its dynamic relationship with environmental factors from 2003 to 2021 using long short-term memory network and interpretability theory models. The results showed that CO2 exhibits a high value area with spatiotemporal flux that shifts from northwest to southeast and has a seasonally fluctuating growth rate of 2.29 ppm/year. Nightlight (NTL) data were highly correlated with the CO2 concentration (0.98), whereas the correlation coefficient between the two centers of gravity was 0.57, indicating a moderate effect on CO2 concentration increases and spatial changes. Moreover, the normalized vegetation index (NDVI) (0.92) was most strongly correlated with interannual changes in CO2, followed by precipitation (0.51), temperature (0.44), and solar radiation (0.14), and the contributions of diurnal variations in these parameters to the spatiotemporal characteristics of CO2 are ordered temperature (6.79) > NDVI (6.36) > solar radiation (2.20) > precipitation (1.66). Overall, this study enhances our understanding of the spatiotemporal characteristics of CO2 concentrations in the BTH region and reveals the driving effects of different factors, especially with regard to natural factors that present nonlinear change characteristics. Moreover, our findings have theoretical and practical significance for reducing CO2 concentrations and mitigating greenhouse effects in the BTH region and other industrial city clusters."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108216,False,Atmospheric Research,该论文主要关注于利用机器学习和贝叶斯模型平均方法，对台风引起的降雨进行预测。研究重点在于提高降雨预测的准确性和鲁棒性，通过整合多种机器学习模型，并动态加权台风特征来实现。虽然该研究与大气现象相关，但它更侧重于气象预测和灾害预警，而不是大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['Typhoon rainfall forecasting', 'Machine learning', 'Bayesian model averaging', 'Weather prediction']",Yifan Chen;Jingwen Zhang;Zejun Li;Pan Liu;Lei Guo;Kairong Lin;Mingzhong Xiao;Xiaohong Chen,Robust Typhoon Rainfall forecasting based on machine learning and Bayesian model averaging,"•BMA integrates four ML models, providing more robust and accurate rainfall predictions. •Dynamically weighted typhoon characteristics are critical for typhoon rainfall forecasting. •IU settings are superior to RO settings as lead time increased from 0 to 6 h. 
 Typhoon-induced heavy rainfall can lead to severe flooding, causing significant damage to social systems. Although machine learning (ML) offers an efficient approach for typhoon rainfall forecasting, individual models often exhibit considerable uncertainty. To address this, this study proposes a robust typhoon rainfall forecasting model based on Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) with four ML models including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), K-Nearest Neighbors Regression (KNN), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) across 0–6 h lead time. The model incorporates three types of features within the typhoon impact area (radius of 400 km): typhoon characteristics, grid spatial attributes and meteorological characteristics. Typhoon characteristics of each grid are dynamically weighted to reflect the weakening typhoon impacts with increasing distance from the typhoon center. Based on these features, multiple scenarios consisting of two experiments (Input Unchanged (IU) and Rolling Forecast (RO)) paired with various input designs (ALL: all features, SHAP3: 3 most critical variables, and LAG4: 4 lagged rainfall) are designed to explore the performance of all models. Case study of 28 typhoons affecting Guangdong Province from 2020 to 2023 clearly demonstrated that the weighted typhoon wind speed contributed the most in typhoon rainfall forecasting, and the BMA approach significantly enhanced the forecast accuracy. Leveraging sufficient effective information as model inputs could significantly improve the predictive performance of individual models in long-term forecasting. This method could provide flexible and suitable scenario options for data-rich and data-scarce regions, supporting early disaster warning during typhoon-prone seasons."

 This study presents a stacking machine learning (SML) model for vertical adjustment of precipitable water vapor (PWV), addressing missing water vapor information near the surface in radio occultation (RO) profiles and enhancing the accuracy of PWV estimation from RO data. The model is trained and validated using more than 1500 ground-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations and more than 320,000 RO profiles of the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate-2 (COSMIC-2) for two regions of the Northern hemisphere from January 2020 to December 2023. Results show that in the North American region, the SML model reduces the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of PWV estimates by 58.05 %, 36.99 %, and 33.05 % compared to conventional linear, exponential, and global PWV vertical adjustment (GPWV-H) models, respectively. In the region of China and Southeast Asia, the RMSE of PWV estimates is reduced by more than 42.9 %. External validation reveals that the SML-adjusted RO-PWV is in close agreement with PWV estimated from radiosondes and other RO products. Notably, the SML model outperforms conventional models across various latitudes and longitudes, making it well-suited for complex terrain and different climatic conditions. This study also examines the SML model performance for different climate types and extreme weather and proposes incorporating these factors in future work to improve model adaptability. Overall, the SML model excels in PWV vertical adjustment, providing a high-accuracy, fast solution for global PWV estimation, water vapor monitoring and weather forecasting."
