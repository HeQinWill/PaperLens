We developed a pollen emissions model using phenology and random forests. Key factors affecting annual pollen emissions include temperature, relative humidity and sunshine hours. Pollen dispersal starts around 10 August, peaks around 30 August and ends by 25 September, lasting about 45 d. Over time, annual pollen emissions exhibit significant fluctuations and a downward trend. 
 In recent years, the intensification of global climate change and environmental pollution has led to a marked increase in pollen-induced allergic diseases. This study leverages 16 years of continuous pollen monitoring data, alongside meteorological factors and plant functional type data, to construct a pollen emissions model using phenology and random forests (RFs). This model is then employed to simulate the emission characteristics of three primary types of autumn pollen (Artemisia, chenopods and total pollen concentration), elucidating the emission patterns throughout the seasonal cycle in Beijing. Phenology and RFs precisely simulate the start and end day of year of pollen, as well as the annual pollen production. There are significant spatiotemporal differences among the three types of pollen. On average, pollen dispersal begins around 10 August, peaks around 30 August and concludes by 25 September, with a dispersal period lasting approximately 45 d. Furthermore, the relationship between pollen emissions and meteorological factors is investigated, revealing that temperature, relative humidity (RH) and sunshine hours (SSHs) significantly influence annual pollen emissions. Specifically, temperature and RH exhibit a strong positive correlation with annual pollen emissions, while SSHs show a negative correlation. Different pollen types display varied responses to meteorological factors. Finally, the constructed pollen emissions model is integrated into the ICTP Regional Climate Model (RegCM) and validated using pollen observation data, confirming its reliability in predicting pollen concentrations. This study not only enhances the understanding of pollen release mechanisms but also provides scientific evidence for the selection and planting of urban greening plants."
10.5194/acp-25-3567-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要探讨了利用全球导航卫星系统（GNSS）信号中的湿延迟来分析大气湍流的方法。论文提出了一种新的滤波方法来研究小尺度的湿延迟变化，并通过对五个全球站点的案例研究，揭示了不同气候带的湍流日变化和季节性模式。这项研究旨在改进水汽和云模型，增强临近预报能力，并优化GNSS和甚长基线干涉测量的随机建模。 虽然论文没有直接提及空气质量监测或大气成分分析，但它关注大气中的水汽含量及其变化，这与大气环境遥感技术中的大气成分研究密切相关。此外，利用GNSS信号进行大气探测也属于遥感技术的范畴，因此可以认为该论文与大气环境遥感技术有较强的相关性。,"['atmospheric water vapor', 'tropospheric delay', 'zenith wet delay (ZWD)', 'GNSS', 'atmospheric boundary layer (ABL)', 'turbulence', 'integrated water vapor (WV)', 'nowcasting', 'climate zones']",Gaël Kermarrec;Xavier Calbet;Zhiguo Deng;Cintia Carbajal Henken,Measurement report: Can zenith wet delay from GNSS “see” atmospheric turbulence? Insights from case studies across diverse climate zones,"Atmospheric delays affect global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals. This study analyses the wet delay, a variable component caused by atmospheric water vapor, using a novel filtering method to examine small-scale turbulent variations. Case studies at five global stations revealed daily and seasonal turbulence patterns. This research will improve water vapour and cloud models, enhance nowcasting, and refine stochastic modelling for GNSS and very long baseline interferometry. 
 Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) microwave signals are nearly unaffected by clouds but are delayed as they travel the troposphere. The hydrostatic delay accounts for approximately 90 % of the total delay and can be modelled well as a function of temperature, pressure, and humidity. On the other hand, the wet delay is highly variable in space and time, making it difficult to model accurately. A zenith wet delay (ZWD) can be estimated as part of the GNSS positioning adjustment and is proportional to the specific humidity in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). While its average term can describe mesoscale events, its small-scale component is associated with turbulent processes in the ABL and is the focus of the present contribution. We introduce a new filtering and estimation strategy to analyse small-scale ZWD variations, addressing questions related to daily or periodic variations in some turbulent parameters and to the dependence of these parameters on climate zones. Five GNSS stations were selected for case studies, revealing promising specific daily and seasonal patterns depending on the estimated turbulence at the GNSS station (buoyancy or shear). This research lays the groundwork for more accurate models and prediction strategies for integrated water vapour, WV (and potentially liquid water clouds), turbulence. It has far-reaching applications, from nowcasting uncertainty assessments to the stochastic modelling for very large baseline interferometry or GNSS."
10.5194/acp-25-3603-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了在碳中和情景下，2010年至2045年气候变化对中国臭氧水平的影响。研究使用Global Change and Air Pollution version 2.0 (GCAP 2.0)模型模拟了未来气候变化对臭氧浓度的影响，并分析了关键气象参数（如温度、辐射和相对湿度）以及化学过程在臭氧变化中的作用。研究结果表明，即使在碳中和的背景下，气候变化仍可能导致中国东部地区的臭氧浓度升高。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术或卫星观测，但其对大气成分（特别是臭氧）的分析，以及对气象参数的关注，都与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为遥感技术可以用于监测臭氧浓度、气象参数以及其他大气成分。,"['ozone levels', 'climate change', 'air quality', 'meteorological parameters', 'chemical production', 'carbon neutrality', 'atmospheric composition']",Ling Kang;Hong Liao;Ke Li;Xu Yue;Yang Yang;Ye Wang,Effects of 2010–2045 climate change on ozone levels in China under a carbon neutrality scenario: key meteorological parameters and processes,"Using the model of Global Change and Air Pollution version 2.0, climate change over 2010–2045 under a carbon neutrality scenario is simulated to increase summertime maximum daily 8 h average ozone (O3) levels in eastern China, the North China Plain, and the Yangtze River Delta by 2.3, 4.7, and 3.0 ppbv, respectively. Temperature, radiation, and relative humidity are the key meteorological parameters and net chemical production is the key process in climate-driven O3 increases in eastern China. 
 We examined the effects of 2010–2045 climate change on ozone (O3) levels in China under a carbon neutrality scenario using the Global Change and Air Pollution version 2.0 (GCAP 2.0) model. In eastern China (EC), GCAP 2.0 and six other models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) all projected increases in daily maximum 2 m temperature (T2max), surface incoming shortwave radiation (SW), and planet boundary layer height and decreases in relative humidity (RH) and sea level pressure. Future climate change is simulated by GCAP 2.0 to have large effects on O3 even under a carbon neutrality pathway, with summertime regional and seasonal mean maximum daily 8 h average (MDA8) O3 concentrations increasing by 2.3 ppbv (3.9 %) over EC, 4.7 ppbv (7.3 %) over the North China Plain, and 3.0 ppbv (5.1 %) over the Yangtze River Delta. Changes in key meteorological parameters were found to explain 58 %–76 % of the climate-driven MDA8 O3 changes over EC. The most important meteorological parameters in summer are T2max and SW in northern and central EC and RH in southern EC. Analysis showed net chemical production was the most important process that increases O3, accounting for 34.0 %–62.5 % of the sum of all processes within the boundary layer. We also quantified the uncertainties in climate-induced MDA8 O3 changes using CMIP6 multi-model projections of climate and a stepwise multiple linear regression model. GCAP 2.0 results are at the lower end of the climate-induced increases in MDA8 O3 from the multi-models. These results have important implications for policy-making regarding emission controls against the background of climate warming."

Gibbs;Melissa Rose;Giacomo Grassi;Joana Melo;Simone Rossi;Viola Heinrich;Nancy L. Harris,Revised and updated geospatial monitoring of  21st century forest carbon fluxes,"Updated global maps of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and sequestration by forests from 2001 onwards using satellite-derived data show that forests are strong net carbon sinks, capturing about as much CO2 each year on average as the USA emitted from fossil fuels in 2019. After reclassifying fluxes to countries’ reporting categories for national GHG inventories, we found that roughly two-thirds of the net CO2 flux from forests is anthropogenic and one-third is non-anthropogenic. 
 Earth observation data are increasingly used to estimate the magnitude and geographic distribution of greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes and reduce overall uncertainty in the global carbon budget, including for forests. Here, we report on a revised and updated geospatial, Earth-observation-based modeling framework that maps GHG emissions, carbon removals, and the net balance between them globally for forests from 2001 to 2023 at roughly 30 m resolution, hereafter referred to as the Global Forest Watch (GFW) model (see the “Code and data availability” section). Revisions address some of the original model's limitations, improve model inputs, and refine the uncertainty analysis. We found that, between 2001 and 2023, global forest ecosystems were, on average, a net sink of −5.5 ± 8.1 Gt CO2e yr−1 (gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent per year ± 1 standard deviation), which reflects the balance of 9.0 ± 2.7 Gt CO2e yr−1 of GHG emissions and −14.5 ± 7.7 Gt CO2 yr−1 of removals, with an additional −0.20 Gt CO2 yr−1 transferred into harvested wood products. Uncertainty in gross removals was greatly reduced compared with the original model due to the refinement of uncertainty for carbon removal factors in temperate secondary forests. After reallocating GFW's gross CO2 fluxes into anthropogenic fluxes from forest land and deforestation categories to increase the conceptual similarity with national greenhouse gas inventories (NGHGIs), we estimated a global net anthropogenic forest sink of −3.6 Gt CO2 yr−1, excluding harvested wood products, with the remaining net CO2 flux of −2.2 Gt CO2 yr−1 reported by the GFW model as non-anthropogenic. Although the magnitude of GFW's translated estimates aligns relatively well with aggregated NGHGIs, the temporal trends differ. Translating Earth-observation-based flux estimates into the same reporting framework that countries use for NGHGIs helps build confidence around land use carbon fluxes and supports independent evaluation of progress towards Paris Agreement goals. The data availability is as follows: carbon removals (Gibbs et al., 2024a,  https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/V2ISRH), GHG emissions (Gibbs et al., 2024b,  https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/LNPSGP), and net flux (Gibbs et al., 2024c, https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/TVZVBI)."

We developed a 30-m annual forest aboveground biomass dataset from 1985 to 2023 using satellite data and deep learning. Our results reveal significant biomass gains, regional variations, and the impact of forest policies. This dataset provides valuable insights for climate research, conservation planning, and sustainable forest management. 
 Accurate estimation and monitoring of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) are essential for understanding carbon dynamics, managing forest resources, and guiding environmental policies. However, the spatial and temporal patterns, dynamics, and driving factors of forest AGB in China over recent decades remain insufficiently understood, hindering ecosystem analysis and forest management strategies. This study combines multi-source remote sensing data with residual neural networks (ResNets) to develop the first 30 m resolution annual China Forest AGB dataset (1985–2023) with uncertainty quantification. Validation results confirm the robustness of the ResNets model, achieving an R2 of 0.92, RMSE of 16.06 Mg/ha, and Bias of 0.06 Mg/ha against GEDI footprint AGBD, and an R2 of 0.63, RMSE of 68.26 Mg/ha, and Bias of -19.87 Mg/ha against independent multi-year ground survey data. The dataset reveals a notable increase in China’s average forest aboveground biomass density (AGBD) from 95.74±11.30 Mg/ha in 1985 to 122.69±13.94 Mg/ha in 2023. During this period, total forest aboveground carbon (AGC) stock rose from 5.50±0.23 PgC to 13.97±0.87 PgC, establishing China’s forests as a significant carbon sink over the past four decades, with a net carbon sink of 0.22±0.01 PgC yr⁻¹, offsetting 11.5 %–14.9 % of China’s fossil fuel and industrial emissions. Forest growth contributed 65.1 % (5.75 PgC) of the total AGC increase, while forest expansion accounted for 34.9 % (3.09 PgC). This dataset provides critical information for forest carbon accounting in China and offers valuable insights for climate change mitigation, ecosystem conservation, and sustainable land management."

Using satellite imagery and field observations, we identify key drivers of bank erosion in large spatial scale and highlight role of river discharge and permafrost. The dataset enhances understanding of river channel dynamics and supports the development of predictive models for river channel evolution and erosion risk assessment. 
 Riverbank erosion monitoring and modeling has a long-standing tradition in Earth system science. The current body of research primarily relies on observations at the basin and reach levels. We endeavored to compile a comprehensive dataset of riverbank migration observations using a variety of measurement techniques, both field-based and remote sensing data. The dataset comprises information from twelve extensive river basins situated in Northern Eurasia, encompassing rivers that drain into the Baltic Sea, the Arctic and Pacific Oceans, and the Caspian Sea, specifically the catchments of the Vistula, Volga, Ural, Ob, Nadym, Yenisey, Lena, Indigirka, Yana, Kolyma, Amur and Kamchatka rivers. The rivers included in the dataset vary in terms of environmental conditions and have average discharges of between 0.3 and 19,700 m3/s. This study examined approximately 140,000 kilometers of rivers in Northern Eurasia, covering small, medium, and large rivers, with data from up to 70 years of water classifications obtained from satellite images, including those from LandSat and Keyhole, across 626,700 river channel segments. The dataset collected average and maximum bank retreat rates (m/year), average areas of bank retreat (m2/year), and volumes of channel erosion (t/year). It also recorded possible causes, encompassing both hydrological and catchment factors like permafrost, natural land zones, and geology. Our study showed that river discharge and permafrost distribution are the primary indicators of riverbank erosion in Northern Eurasia. These data will enhance the comprehension of bank erosion processes and their underlying factors, thereby facilitating the development of more accurate predictive models of river channels. The dataset is available open access via the ZENODO repository (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11072919) (Chalov et al., 2025)."

This is often lacking in current disaster databases. SHEDIS-Temperature fills this gap by integrating impact records with information on disaster locations, high-resolution meteorological data, and population estimates. Covering 382 disasters in 71 countries (1979–2018), this dataset enables deeper analyses of heat-related risk and vulnerabilities. 
 International databases of disaster impacts are crucial for advancing disaster risk research, particularly as climate change intensifies the frequency and intensity of many natural hazards – including temperature extremes. However, many widely-used disaster impact databases lack information on the physical dimension of the hazards associated with an impact, and on the exposure to such hazards. This hinders analysing drivers of severe disaster outcomes. To bridge this knowledge gap, we present SHEDIS-Temperature, a dataset that provides Subnational Hazard and Exposure information for temperature-related DISaster impact records (https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/WNOTTC; Lindersson and Messori, 2025). This open-access dataset links temperature-related impact records from the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) with subnational data on their locations, associated meteorological time series, and population maps. SHEDIS-Temperature provides hazard and exposure data for 2,835 subnational locations associated with 382 disaster records from 1979 to 2018 in 71 countries. Detailed hazard metrics, derived from 0.1° 3-hourly data, encompass absolute indicators, such as the heat stress measure apparent temperature accounting for humidity and wind speed, as well as percentile-based indicators of when and where temperatures exceeded local thresholds. Population exposure data include annual population figures for impacted subnational administrative units and person-days of exposure to threshold-exceeding temperatures. Outputs are available at grid-point level as well as zonally aggregated to administrative subdivision units, and disaster-record levels. By providing comprehensive attributes across the hazard-exposure spectrum, SHEDIS-Temperature supports interdisciplinary research on past temperature-related disasters, offering valuable insights for future risk mitigation and resilience strategies."

These include studying the evolution of wind patterns, understanding weather systems, and measuring air mass travel time over land. 
 Meteorological reanalyses are crucial datasets in atmospheric research, providing the foundation for many scientific applications.

The datasets were developed using a data-driven approach and rigorously validated against in situ observations and existing H and Tsa datasets, demonstrating both high accuracy and exceptional spatial resolution. 
 Accurate estimation of land surface sensible heat flux (H) is crucial for comprehending the dynamics of surface energy transfer and the cycles of water and carbon. Yet, existing H products mainly are meteorological reanalysis datasets with coarse spatial resolutions and high uncertainties. FLUXCOM is the sole remotely sensed product with its 0.0833° spatial and 8-day temporal resolution spanning from 2001 to 2015, so there is still a need for accurate and high spatial resolution global product based on satellite data. To address these issues, we generated the first global high resolution (1 km) daily H product from 2000 to 2020 using long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning models, incorporating data from the Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) product suite. Furthermore, considering that the difference between land surface temperature and air temperature (Tsa) is a key driver of H, we introduce the first global accurate satellite-based Tsa product. This product refines the uncertainty compared with obtaining Tsa directly from existing products by subtracting air temperature from land surface temperature. Our model, distinct from previous models that estimate H per pixel through physically-based models requiring parameters that are not readily accessible, can conveniently derive global values and efficiently capture nonlinear interactions. Additionally, it accounts for the temporal variation of H. Validation against independent in-situ measurements yielded a root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2) of 25.54 Wm⁻2, 18.649 Wm⁻2, and 0.54 for H, and 1.459 K, 1.071 K, and 0.53 for Tsa, respectively. The estimated H and Tsa values are more accurate than current products such as MERRA2, ERA5-Land, ERA5, and FLUXCOM under most conditions. Additionally, the new H product offers more detailed spatial information in diverse landscapes. The estimated global average land surface H from 2000 to 2020 is 35.29±0.71 Wm⁻2. These high-resolution H and Tsa products are invaluable for climatic researches and numerous other applications.

As a first application of this new capability, this paper presents a method for predicting UV indices with MAR. 
 The MAR (Modèle Atmosphérique Régional) is a regional climate model used for weather forecasting and climate studies over several continents, including polar regions. To simulate how solar radiation and Earth's infrared radiation propagate through the atmosphere and drive climate, MAR uses the Morcrette radiation scheme. Last updated in the 2000s, this scheme is no longer maintained and lacks the flexibility to add new capabilities, such as computing high-resolution spectral fluxes.This paper presents version 3.14 of MAR, an update that allows MAR to run with ecRad, the latest radiation scheme provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Operational in the ECMWF's Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) since 2017, ecRad was designed with modularity in mind and is still in active development.We evaluate the updated MAR by comparing its outputs over 2011–2020 for Belgium to gridded data provided by the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium (RMIB) and by the EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility on Land Surface Analysis. Several sensitivity experiments have been carried out to find the configuration achieving the most balanced radiative budget, as well as to demonstrate that the updated MAR is better equipped to achieve such a balance.

The model is validated globally with satellite data and nearshore using in situ data. The model allows for the first time direct comparisons with in situ data collected at 10–30 m water depth, which is very close to shore due to the steep slope usually surrounding volcanic islands. 
 Climate change is driving sea-level rise and potentially intensifying extreme events in the tropical belt, thereby increasing coastal hazards. On tropical islands, extreme sea levels and subsequent marine flooding can be triggered by cyclones but also distant-source swells. Knowledge of sea states in the tropical ocean is thus of key importance, and their study is usually based on spectral wave models. However, existing global wave models typically employ regular grids with a coarse resolution, which fail to accurately represent volcanic archipelagos, a problem usually circumvented by the use of obstruction grids but typically resulting in large negative biases. To overcome this problem, this study presents a new global wave model with a focus on distant-source swells, which have received less attention than waves generated by cyclones. To accurately simulate sea states in tropical areas, we implemented the spectral wave model WAVEWATCH III© (WW3) over a global unstructured grid with a spatial resolution ranging from 50 km to 100 m. The model is forced by ERA5 wind fields, corrected for negative biases through a quantile–quantile approach based on satellite radiometer data. The wind input source terms adjusted accordingly and the explicit representation of tropical islands result in improved predictive skills in the tropical ocean. Moreover, this new simulation allows for the first time direct comparisons with the in situ data collected on volcanic islands at water depths ranging from 10 to 30 m, which corresponds to a few hundred meters from the shore."

Radiative transfer models (RTMs) play a crucial role in direct data assimilation. In this study, we introduce a new RTM, the Advanced Radiative Transfer Modeling System – Ground-Based (ARMS-gb), designed to simulate brightness temperatures observed by GMRs along with their Jacobians. Several enhancements have been incorporated to achieve higher accuracy. 
 This study proposes a fast radiative transfer model, the Advanced Radiative Transfer Modeling System – ground-based (ARMS-gb), designed to simulate brightness temperatures observed by ground-based microwave radiometers. ARMS-gb employs a clear-sky radiative transfer solver to account for atmospheric thermal emissions, while gaseous absorption is estimated using a statistical regression scheme. To enhance simulation accuracy, particularly in moist environments, seven humid profiles from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County 48-profile dataset are added to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts 83-profile dataset to train the gaseous absorption scheme. Additionally, an advanced water vapor vertical interpolation method is incorporated, offering improved accuracy compared to the interpolation method used in Radiative Transfer for TOVS (RTTOV)-gb. The standard deviation is reduced by 0.15 K in channels with strong water vapor absorption. The Jacobians calculated by these two interpolation modes are also different. To further validate ARMS-gb's performance, simulations using both ARMS-gb and RTTOV-gb are compared against real observations from two ground-based microwave radiometers. The observation minus background analyses demonstrates that ARMS-gb aligns well with RTTOV-gb and achieves smaller standard deviations under high-humidity conditions. Furthermore, the capability of ARMS-gb to monitor the observational quality of ground-based microwave radiometers is demonstrated."

An arbitrary choice of the number of larvae released from each source location in forward tracking is found to cause ambiguous self-recruitment. In contrast, we found that an arbitrary choice of the number of larvae released from the settlement location in backtracking leads to unambiguous self-recruitment. 
 Accurately estimating self-recruitment (SR), the fraction of recruits in a location that originated locally, is critical for understanding population connectivity. Biophysical models have been typically applied to compute SR by releasing a certain number of larval particles from each assumed source location and tracking them forward in time. However, various strategies have been employed for releasing these larval particles: including randomly, consistently, or a number proportional to the location’s area or larval production, which causes ambiguous results. We demonstrate, using theoretical arguments and numerical simulations from Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) larvae in Lake Erie, that SR depends on larval production at each source location. This dependency suggests that SR may not be computed unambiguously in these models unless realistic larval production is released from all potential source locations. In contrast, parentage analysis studies typically computed SR by assessing the fraction of sampled juveniles that originate locally at a settlement location, instead of identifying larval production at all sources. Therefore, tracking larval particles backward from the settlement location is proposed as a straightforward approach for computing SR. Our findings demonstrate that SR is independent of the number of larval recruits at the settlement location, supporting the employment of backtracking models with randomly released larval particles. In this way, considerable effort and resources, that would otherwise be spent on identifying all potential sources and their larval output, in forward tracking can be saved. We believe this result will have important implications for studies on larval dispersal and recruitment in aquatic systems."

One barrier to the implementation of water recycling projects is the cost, for both the municipality and the consumers. This research uses a consumer choice survey of 1000 individuals in the United States to evaluate consumer willingness to pay for potable recycled water, considering the impact of terminology (“purified water,” “recycled water,” “reused water,” “reclaimed water,” and “treated wastewater”) and future outdoor watering restrictions. Analysis of survey responses calculated consumer willingness to pay using mixed logit models. Results demonstrate the importance of terminology on consumer willingness to pay and the consistency of preference for the term “purified water” across cities in the United States. Consumers were also willing to pay for potable recycled water to avoid or reduce water restrictions, although the magnitude was small. Shifting from the commonly used “recycled water,” a less preferred term, to “purified water” is expected to increase both consumer acceptance and willingness to pay for the exact same product. Our results demonstrate how important terminology can be in public communication and policy discussions in general and in the successful design and promotion of residential water management projects in particular."

In this study, we developed a nontargeted approach to analyze particulate electrophilic compounds in urban Beijing and identified 147 ones with significant diurnal variation, among which oxygenated aromatic compounds (OACs) are the predominant species. The discrepancy in hierarchical clustering analysis of atmospheric transformation markers, e.g., 9-nitroanthracene (9NANT) and citraconic anhydride (CA), and PAHs, e.g., fluoranthene (FLT), suggested a potential secondary formation pathway in the urban atmosphere. The isomeric ratio of acephenanthrylene (ACP) to FLT, and the product-to-precursor ratio of 11H-benzo[a]fluorene-11-one (BaFO) to FLT, further demonstrated the prevailing existence of atmospheric oxidation. The relationship between night-to-day variation and molecular characteristics, particularly the significant negative correlation with oxygen-related features such as the carbon oxidation state, confirmed that multigenerational oxidation processes during daytime predominantly drive diurnal/nocturnal differences. This study achieved a systematic identification of electrophilic compounds and their transformation in the atmosphere, revealing the pivotal role of oxidation on the fate of organic chemicals that resulted in their diurnal variation."

Bacterial culture, the gold standard for Salmonella detection, is time-consuming and cumbersome. Herein, a novel ratiometric electrochemical biosensing platform was constructed for Salmonella detection based on combining the electrochemical signals of a DNAzyme and metal–organic framework (MOF) and programmed DNA assembly amplification by target-specific cleavage of catalyzed hairpin assembly (CHA). DNAzyme is used to identify and detect S. typhimurium (ST) due to its release of RNase H2 (STH2) which specifically cleaves the rA site in DNAzyme, causing a subsequent reaction. To achieve proportional dual signaling strategy, the electrochemical signaling tag, ferrocene (Fc), was modified onto the DNA sequence H1, and Fe-MOF, an electrochemical indicator with high redox potential separation, was selected as the signaling probe. The prepared ratiometric electrochemical biosensor was analyzed via alternating current voltammetry (ACV). Salmonella detection in urban water source samples using the novel biosensor yielded essentially the same results as commercial Salmonella test strips, with even higher sensitivity, confirming the accuracy and usefulness of this sensing strategy.

Aerosol toxicity strongly depends upon components whose chemical profiles and concentrations can constantly evolve throughout atmospheric transformation, inhalation, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. Despite the abundant studies on aerosol components and their toxic effects, the dynamics in component concentrations and related biological effects from air to the body remain unclear. Here, we propose a conceptual toxicokinetic framework to mathematically deduce the bioavailable concentration from the changing bulk concentration of aerosol constituents in the atmosphere. The biological effects of single or multiple components are further predicted via toxicodynamic modeling according to their bioavailable concentrations. Atmospheric concentrations of toxic composition can in turn be regulated by risk-based guidelines, aiming to alleviate in vivo toxic effects. This perspective demonstrates how serial toxicokinetic–toxicodynamic equations bridge the knowledge gap between ambient aerosols and associated toxic effects in human bodies. The prediction from an inhalation perspective also allows connecting with the exposomes from aggregate exposure pathways. We call for the development of the model validity and integrate quantitative adverse outcome pathways to apply for exposure–disease modeling, providing novel insights into air quality policymaking and public health management."

We use a 1,224 years (800–2023 CE) record of observed and reconstructed soil moisture, in concert with a paleoclimate reanalysis product, to place the 20th‐century pluvials in a longer‐term context and investigate the occurrence and dynamics of similar events in the Common Era. Analyses of the soil moisture reconstruction demonstrate that pluvials and megapluvials are as ubiquitous as droughts and megadroughts over the last millennium. The early (19 years; 1905–1923) and late (22 years; 1978–1999) 20th‐century pluvials rank as the second and first wettest in the record, respectively, positioning these as events on par with the most extreme megadroughts. Pluvials show a strong association with tropical Pacific (warm) sea surface temperatures (SSTs) during the 20th century and over the prior millennium, though the role of the tropical Atlantic is much more uncertain and ambiguous. Using a Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach trained on the pre‐industrial period (800–1849 CE), we find that the record setting late 20th‐century megapluvial likely occurred as a consequence of anomalously strong Pacific sea surface temperature forcing. This work establishes pluvial and megapluvial events as intrinsic components of Common Era hydroclimate variability in SWNA, comparable in importance to droughts and megadroughts."

NASA Cloud Radar System (CRS) reflectivity and Doppler data revealed gravity waves within the nimbostratus below a strong temperature inversion that was caused by warm air advection near an occluded front in an extratropical cyclone.

Longwave warming effects dominate during the winter when snow albedos are high (0.8–0.9) and the background atmospheric precipitable water vapor is low (< ${< } $0.5 cm), yielding a maximum monthly average net CRF of +34.7 W·m−2, meaning that clouds increase the net radiation relative to clear skies during this time period. The sign of net CRF switches in the warm season as snow recedes, sun‐angles increase, and the North American monsoon arrives, yielding a minimum monthly average net CRF of −47.6 W·m−2 with hourly minima of −600 W·m−2. The sign of net CRF is typically positive, even at solar noon, when the surface is snow covered, except for a brief period over melting, low‐albedo snow (0.5–0.6) impacted by dust impurities. Sensitivity tests elucidate the role of the surface albedo on the net CRF. The results suggest that net CRF will increase in magnitude and lead to a more persistent cooling effect on the surface net radiation budget as the snow cover declines."
10.1029/2024JD041804,False,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文主要研究对流产生的重力波及其对准两年振荡（QBO）的影响。研究重点在于通过高空气球观测分析重力波的特性，包括相速度、动量通量和阻力，并识别由“移动山”机制产生的重力波。研究结果表明，重力波对50hPa以下的QBO驱动有显著贡献，而“移动山”机制产生的波也占了其中的一部分。虽然该研究涉及大气现象，但它更侧重于大气动力学和气候模型，而不是直接与大气环境遥感技术相关，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['gravity waves', 'quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO)', 'convection', 'momentum flux', 'drag', 'superpressure balloons']",Milena Corcos;Martina Bramberger;M.

There is a wave component that is stationary with respect to the convective cells that is triggered by convection acting like a barrier to the background flow (moving mountain mechanism). Waves from this mechanism have only been observed in a few case studies and are not parameterized in climate models. However, the representation of the whole spectrum of gravity waves is crucial for the simulation of the QBO, especially in the lowermost stratosphere (below 50 hPa) where the QBO amplitudes are under‐estimated in current global circulation models. In this study, we present analysis of convective gravity wave observations from superpressure balloons in boreal winter 2019 and 2021, retrieving phase speeds, momentum fluxes, and drag. We also identify waves generated by the moving mountain mechanism using the theory of the Beres scheme as a basis. These waves do not have a specific period, but are of smaller horizontal scale, on average around 300 km, which is similar to the scale of convective systems. Our results show that gravity waves contribute up to 2/3 to the QBO forcing below 50 hPa and waves from the moving mountain mechanism are responsible for up to 10% of this forcing."

 The tumour-suppressor protein BRCA2 has a central role in homology-directed DNA repair by enhancing the formation of RAD51 filaments on resected single-stranded DNA generated at double-stranded DNA breaks and stimulating RAD51 activity1,2. Individuals with BRCA2 mutations are predisposed to cancer; however, BRCA2-deficient tumours are often responsive to targeted therapy with PARP inhibitors (PARPi)3–6. The mechanism by which BRCA2 deficiency renders cells sensitive to PARPi but with minimal toxicity in cells heterozygous for BRCA2 mutations remains unclear. Here we identify a previously unknown role of BRCA2 that is directly linked to the effect of PARP1 inhibition. Using biochemical and single-molecule approaches, we demonstrate that PARPi-mediated PARP1 retention on a resected DNA substrate interferes with RAD51 filament stability and impairs RAD51-mediated DNA strand exchange. Full-length BRCA2 protects RAD51 filaments and counteracts the instability conferred by PARPi-mediated retention by preventing the binding of PARP1 to DNA. Extending these findings to a cellular context, we use quantitative single-molecule localization microscopy to show that BRCA2 prevents PARPi-induced PARP1 retention at homologous-recombination repair sites. By contrast, BRCA2-deficient cells exhibit increased PARP1 retention at these lesions in response to PARPi. These results provide mechanistic insights into the role of BRCA2 in maintaining RAD51 stability and protecting homologous-recombination repair sites by mitigating PARPi-mediated PARP1 retention.

 Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) are tetrameric ligand-gated ion channels that mediate most excitatory neurotransmission1. iGluRs are gated by glutamate, where on glutamate binding, they open their ion channels to enable cation influx into postsynaptic neurons, initiating signal transduction1,2. The structural mechanics of how glutamate gating occurs in full-length iGluRs is not well understood. Here, using the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid subtype iGluR (AMPAR), we identify the glutamate-gating mechanism. AMPAR activation by glutamate is augmented at physiological temperatures. By preparing AMPARs for cryogenic-electron microscopy at these temperatures, we captured the glutamate-gating mechanism. Activation by glutamate initiates ion channel opening that involves all ion channel helices hinging away from the pore axis in a motif that is conserved across all iGluRs. Desensitization occurs when the local dimer pairs decouple and enables closure of the ion channel below through restoring the channel hinges and refolding the channel gate. Our findings define how glutamate gates iGluRs, provide foundations for therapeutic design and demonstrate how physiological temperatures can alter iGluR function. Physiological temperatures augment activation of glutamate receptors, which enables the structural basis of neuronal excitation to be elucidated."

 Reactive oxygen species (ROS) underlie human pathologies including cancer and neurodegeneration1,2. However, the proteins that sense ROS levels and regulate their production through their cysteine residues remain ill defined. Here, using systematic base-editing and computational screens, we identify cysteines in VPS35, a member of the retromer trafficking complex3, that phenocopy inhibition of mitochondrial translation when mutated. We find that VPS35 underlies a reactive metabolite-sensing pathway that lowers mitochondrial translation to decrease ROS levels. Intracellular hydrogen peroxide oxidizes cysteine residues in VPS35, resulting in retromer dissociation from endosomal membranes and subsequent plasma membrane remodelling. We demonstrate that plasma membrane localization of the retromer substrate SLC7A1 is required to sustain mitochondrial translation. Furthermore, decreasing VPS35 levels or oxidation of its ROS-sensing cysteines confers resistance to ROS-generating chemotherapies, including cisplatin, in ovarian cancer models. Thus, we identify that intracellular ROS levels are communicated to the plasma membrane through VPS35 to regulate mitochondrial translation, connecting cytosolic ROS sensing to mitochondrial ROS production.

 Meningomyelocele (also known as spina bifida) is considered to be a genetically complex disease resulting from a failure of the neural tube to close. Individuals with meningomyelocele display neuromotor disability and frequent hydrocephalus, requiring ventricular shunting. A few genes have been proposed to contribute to disease susceptibility, but beyond that it remains unexplained1. We postulated that de novo mutations under purifying selection contribute to the risk of developing meningomyelocele2. Here we recruited a cohort of 851 meningomyelocele trios who required shunting at birth and 732 control trios, and found that de novo likely gene disruption or damaging missense mutations occurred in approximately 22.3% of subjects, with 28% of such variants estimated to contribute to disease risk. The 187 genes with damaging de novo mutations collectively define networks including actin cytoskeleton and microtubule-based processes, Netrin-1 signalling and chromatin-modifying enzymes. Gene validation demonstrated partial or complete loss of function, impaired signalling and defective closure of the neural tube in Xenopus embryos. Our results indicate that de novo mutations make key contributions to meningomyelocele risk, and highlight critical pathways required for neural tube closure in human embryogenesis.

Until now, porcine hearts and kidneys have been successively transplanted into humans3–7. In this study, heterotopic auxiliary transplantation was used to donate a six-gene-edited pig liver to a brain-dead recipient. The graft function, haemodynamics, and immune and inflammatory responses of the recipient were monitored over the subsequent 10 days. Two hours after portal vein reperfusion of the xenograft, goldish bile was produced, increasing to 66.5 ml by postoperative day 10. Porcine liver-derived albumin also increased after surgery. Alanine aminotransferase levels remained in the normal range, while aspartate aminotransferase levels increased on postoperative day 1 and then rapidly declined. Blood flow velocity in the porcine hepatic artery and portal and hepatic veins remained at an acceptable level. Although platelet numbers decreased early after surgery, they ultimately returned to normal levels. Histological analyses showed that the porcine liver regenerated capably with no signs of rejection. T cell activity was inhibited by anti-thymocyte globulin administration, and B cell activation increased 3 days after surgery and was then inhibited by rituximab. There were no significant peri-operative changes in immunoglobulin G or immunoglobulin M levels. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels were initially elevated and then quickly declined.

 Limited strategies exist for chemical recycling of commodity diene polymers, like those found in tyres1–3.

Specifically, we develop a sulfur diimide reagent4,5 that enables up to about 35% allylic amination of diene polymers and rubber. Then, we apply the cationic 2-aza-Cope rearrangement to deconstruct aminated diene polymers. In a model system, we see molecular weight reduction from 58,100 to approximately 400 g mol−1, and aminated post-consumer rubber is deconstructed over 6 hours into soluble amine-functionalized polymers, which can be utilized to prepare epoxy thermosets with similar stiffnesses to commercial bisphenol A-derived resins6.

Here, to address this, non-isotopic ligation-based ultraviolet-light-induced cross-linking and immunoprecipitation6 was combined with mass spectrometry (irCLIP-RNP) to identify RNA-dependent associated proteins (RDAPs) co-bound to RNA with any RBP of interest. irCLIP-RNP defined landscapes of multimeric protein assemblies on RNA, revealing patterns of RBP–RNA associations, including cell-type-selective combinatorial relationships between RDAPs and primary RBPs. irCLIP-RNP also defined dynamic RDAP remodelling in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF), revealing that EGF-induced recruitment of UPF1 adjacent to HNRNPC promotes splicing surveillance of cell proliferation mRNAs. To identify the RNAs simultaneously co-bound by multiple studied RBPs, a sequential immunoprecipitation irCLIP (Re-CLIP) method was also developed. Re-CLIP confirmed binding relationships observed in irCLIP-RNP and identified HNRNPC and UPF1 RBP co-binding on RND3 and DDX3X mRNAs. irCLIP-RNP and Re-CLIP provide a framework to identify and characterize dynamic RNA–protein assemblies in living cells.

 Lasso peptides (biologically active molecules with a distinct structurally constrained knotted fold) are natural products that belong to the class of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides1–3. Lasso peptides act on several bacterial targets4,5, but none have been reported to inhibit the ribosome, one of the main targets of antibiotics in the bacterial cell6,7. Here we report the identification and characterization of the lasso peptide antibiotic lariocidin and its internally cyclized derivative lariocidin B, produced by Paenibacillus sp. M2, which has broad-spectrum activity against a range of bacterial pathogens. We show that lariocidins inhibit bacterial growth by binding to the ribosome and interfering with protein synthesis. Structural, genetic and biochemical data show that lariocidins bind at a unique site in the small ribosomal subunit, where they interact with the 16S ribosomal RNA and aminoacyl-tRNA, inhibiting translocation and inducing miscoding. Lariocidin is unaffected by common resistance mechanisms, has a low propensity for generating spontaneous resistance, shows no toxicity to human cells, and has potent in vivo activity in a mouse model of Acinetobacter baumannii infection. Our identification of ribosome-targeting lasso peptides uncovers new routes towards the discovery of alternative protein-synthesis inhibitors and offers a novel chemical scaffold for the development of much-needed antibacterial drugs.

 Hardware implementations of artificial neural networks (ANNs)—the most advanced of which are made of millions of electronic neurons interconnected by hundreds of millions of electronic synapses—have achieved higher energy efficiency than classical computers in some small-scale data-intensive computing tasks1. State-of-the-art neuromorphic computers, such as Intel’s Loihi2 or IBM’s NorthPole3, implement ANNs using bio-inspired neuron- and synapse-mimicking circuits made of complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) transistors, at least 18 per neuron and six per synapse. Simplifying the structure and size of these two building blocks would enable the construction of more sophisticated, larger and more energy-efficient ANNs. Here we show that a single CMOS transistor can exhibit neural and synaptic behaviours if biased in a specific (unconventional) manner. By connecting one additional CMOS transistor in series, we build a versatile 2-transistor-cell that exhibits adjustable neuro-synaptic response (which we named neuro-synaptic random access memory cell, or NS-RAM cell). This electronic performance comes with a yield of 100% and an ultra-low device-to-device variability, owing to the maturity of the silicon CMOS platform used—no materials or devices alien to the CMOS process are required. These results represent a short-term solution for the implementation of efficient ANNs and an opportunity in terms of CMOS circuit design and optimization for artificial intelligence applications.

 Carbohydrates are an abundant, inexpensive and renewable biomass feedstock that could be a cornerstone for sustainable chemical manufacturing, but scalable and environmentally friendly methods that leverage these feedstocks are lacking. For example, 1-allyl sorbitol is the foundational building block for the polypropylene clarifying agent Millad NX 8000, which is produced on the multi-metric ton scale annually, but the manufacturing process at present requires superstoichiometric amounts of tin1,2. The NX 8000 additives dominate about 80% of the global clarified polypropylene market3 and are used in concentrations of 0.01–1% during polypropylene production to improve its transparency and resistance to high temperatures, translating to 300–30,000 metric tons annually. The market volume of polypropylene in 2022 was approximately 79.01 million metric tons (MMT), with demand expected to rise by nearly 33% to 105 MMT by 2030 (ref. 4). The cost and sustainability benefits of clarified polypropylene are driving this demand, necessitating more clarifying agents5.

Aldohexoses, aminohexoses, ketohexoses and aldopentoses are all allylated in high yield under mild conditions and the indium metal is recoverable and reusable with no loss of catalytic activity. Leveraging these features, this process was translated to a scalable continuous synthesis of 1-allyl sorbitol in flow6 with high yield and productivity through Bayesian optimization of reaction parameters.

 An increased level of phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit-α (eIF2α, encoded by EIF2S1; eIF2α-p) coupled with decreased guanine nucleotide exchange activity of eIF2B is a hallmark of the ‘canonical’ integrated stress response (c-ISR)1. It is unclear whether impaired eIF2B activity in human diseases including leukodystrophies2, which occurs in the absence of eIF2α-p induction, is synonymous with the c-ISR. Here we describe a mechanism triggered by decreased eIF2B activity, distinct from the c-ISR, which we term the split ISR (s-ISR). The s-ISR is characterized by translational and transcriptional programs that are different from those observed in the c-ISR. Opposite to the c-ISR, the s-ISR requires eIF4E-dependent translation of the upstream open reading frame 1 and subsequent stabilization of ATF4 mRNA. This is followed by altered expression of a subset of metabolic genes (for example, PCK2), resulting in metabolic rewiring required to maintain cellular bioenergetics when eIF2B activity is attenuated. Overall, these data demonstrate a plasticity of the mammalian ISR, whereby the loss of eIF2B activity in the absence of eIF2α-p induction activates the eIF4E–ATF4–PCK2 axis to maintain energy homeostasis. A study describes the split integrated stress response, a cellular stress response mechanism characterized by reduced eIF2B activity without eIF2α phosphorylation, which activates the eIF4E–ATF4–PCK2 axis, enabling metabolic reprogramming."

 The coronavirus membrane protein (M) is the main organizer of coronavirus assembly1–3. Here, we report on an M-targeting molecule, CIM-834, that blocks the assembly of SARS-CoV-2. CIM-834 was obtained through high-throughput phenotypic antiviral screening followed by medicinal-chemistry efforts and target elucidation. CIM-834 inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 (including a broad panel of variants) and SARS-CoV. In SCID mice and Syrian hamsters intranasally infected with SARS-CoV-2, oral treatment reduced lung viral titres to nearly undetectable levels, even (as shown in mice) when treatment was delayed until 24 h before the end point. Treatment of infected hamsters prevented transmission to untreated sentinels. Transmission electron microscopy studies show that virion assembly is completely absent in cells treated with CIM-834. Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy reveals that CIM-834 binds and stabilizes the M protein in its short form, thereby preventing the conformational switch to the long form, which is required for successful particle assembly. In conclusion, we have discovered a new druggable target in the replication cycle of coronaviruses and a small molecule that potently inhibits it. High-throughput screening and hit optimization have led to the development of a small molecule, CIM-834, that targets the SARS-CoV-2 membrane protein and blocks assembly of the virus."

 Liver regeneration after hepatectomy follows accurate coordination with the body’s specific requirements1–3. However, the molecular mechanisms, factors and particular hepatocyte population influencing its efficiency remain unclear. Here we report on a unique regeneration mechanism involving unconventional RPB5 prefoldin interactor 1 (URI1), which exclusively colocalizes with, binds to and activates glutamine synthase (GS) in pericentral hepatocytes. Genetic GS or URI1 depletion in mouse pericentral hepatocytes increases circulating glutamate levels, accelerating liver regeneration after two-third hepatectomy. Conversely, mouse hepatocytic URI1 overexpression hinders liver restoration, which can be reversed by elevating glutamate through supplementation or genetic GS depletion. Glutamate metabolically reprograms bone-marrow-derived macrophages, stabilizing HIF1α, which transcriptionally activates WNT3 to promote YAP1-dependent hepatocyte proliferation, boosting liver regeneration. GS regulation by URI1 is a mechanism that maintains optimal glutamate levels, probably to spatiotemporally fine-tune liver growth in accordance with the body’s homeostasis and nutrient supply. Accordingly, in acute and chronic injury models, including in cirrhotic mice with low glutamate levels and in early mortality after liver resection, as well as in mice undergoing 90% hepatectomy, glutamate addition enhances hepatocyte proliferation and survival. Furthermore, URI1 and GS expression co-localize in human hepatocytes and correlate with WNT3 in immune cells across liver disease stages. Glutamate supplementation may therefore support liver regeneration, benefiting patients awaiting transplants or recovering from hepatectomy. Glutamate metabolically reprograms bone-marrow-derived macrophages, stabilizing HIF1α, which transcriptionally activates WNT3 to promote YAP1-dependent hepatocyte proliferation, boosting liver regeneration."

 The eukaryotic circadian clock keeps time by using a transcription–translation feedback loop, which exhibits an architecture that is conserved across a diverse range of organisms, including fungi, plants and animals1. Despite their mechanistic similarity, the molecular components of these clocks indicate a lack of common ancestry2. Our study reveals that RUVBL2, which is a P-loop NTPase enzyme previously shown to affect circadian phase and amplitude as part of mammalian clock super-complexes, influences the circadian period through its remarkably slow ATPase activity, resembling the well-characterized KaiC-based clock in cyanobacteria. A screen of RUVBL2 variants identified arrhythmic, short-period and long-period mutants that altered circadian locomotor activity rhythms following delivery by adeno-associated virus to the murine suprachiasmatic nucleus. Enzymatic assays showed that wild-type RUVBL2 hydrolyses only around 13 ATP molecules a day, a vastly reduced turnover compared with typical ATPases. Notably, physical interactions between RUVBL2 orthologues and core clock proteins in humans, Drosophila and the fungus Neurospora, along with consistent circadian phenotypes of RUVBL2-mutant orthologues across species, reinforce their clock-related function in eukaryotes. Thus, as well as establishing RUVBL2 as a common core component in eukaryotic clocks, our study supports the idea that slow ATPase activity, initially discovered in cyanobacteria, is a shared feature of eukaryotic clocks.

 Human activities drive a wide range of environmental pressures, including habitat change, pollution and climate change, resulting in unprecedented effects on biodiversity1,2. However, despite decades of research, generalizations on the dimensions and extent of human impacts on biodiversity remain ambiguous. Mixed views persist on the trajectory of biodiversity at the local scale3 and even more so on the biotic homogenization of biodiversity across space4,5. We compiled 2,133 publications covering 97,783 impacted and reference sites, creating an unparallelled dataset of 3,667 independent comparisons of biodiversity impacts across all main organismal groups, habitats and the five most predominant human pressures1,6. For all comparisons, we quantified three key measures of biodiversity to assess how these human pressures drive homogenization and shifts in composition of biological communities across space and changes in local diversity, respectively. We show that human pressures distinctly shift community composition and decrease local diversity across terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. Yet, contrary to long-standing expectations, there is no clear general homogenization of communities. Critically, the direction and magnitude of biodiversity changes vary across pressures, organisms and scales at which they are studied. Our exhaustive global analysis reveals the general impact and key mediating factors of human pressures on biodiversity and can benchmark conservation strategies.

 Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) powers brain activity1,2, and mitochondrial defects are linked to neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders3,4. To understand the basis of brain activity and behaviour, there is a need to define the molecular energetic landscape of the brain5–10. Here, to bridge the scale gap between cognitive neuroscience and cell biology, we developed a physical voxelization approach to partition a frozen human coronal hemisphere section into 703 voxels comparable to neuroimaging resolution (3 × 3 × 3 mm). In each cortical and subcortical brain voxel, we profiled mitochondrial phenotypes, including OXPHOS enzyme activities, mitochondrial DNA and volume density, and mitochondria-specific respiratory capacity. We show that the human brain contains diverse mitochondrial phenotypes driven by both topology and cell types. Compared with white matter, grey matter contains >50% more mitochondria. Moreover, the mitochondria in grey matter are biochemically optimized for energy transformation, particularly among recently evolved cortical brain regions. Scaling these data to the whole brain, we created a backwards linear regression model that integrates several neuroimaging modalities11 to generate a brain-wide map of mitochondrial distribution and specialization. This model predicted mitochondrial characteristics in an independent brain region of the same donor brain. This approach and the resulting MitoBrainMap of mitochondrial phenotypes provide a foundation for exploring the molecular energetic landscape that enables normal brain function. This resource also relates to neuroimaging data and defines the subcellular basis for regionalized brain processes relevant to neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.

 Regulatory T (Treg) cells, which specifically express the master transcription factor FOXP3, have a pivotal role in maintaining immunological tolerance and homeostasis and have the potential to revolutionize cell therapies for autoimmune diseases1–3. Although stimulation of naive CD4+ T cells in the presence of TGFβ and IL-2 can induce FOXP3+ Treg cells in vitro (iTreg cells), the resulting cells are often unstable and have thus far hampered translational efforts4–6. A systematic approach towards understanding the regulatory networks that dictate Treg differentiation could lead to more effective iTreg cell-based therapies. Here we performed a genome-wide CRISPR loss-of-function screen to catalogue gene regulatory determinants of FOXP3 induction in primary human T cells and characterized their effects at single-cell resolution using Perturb-icCITE-seq. We identify the RBPJ–NCOR repressor complex as a novel, context-specific negative regulator of FOXP3 expression. RBPJ-targeted knockout enhanced iTreg differentiation and function, independent of canonical Notch signalling. Repeated cytokine and T cell receptor signalling stimulation in vitro revealed that RBPJ-deficient iTreg cells exhibit increased phenotypic stability compared with control cells through DNA demethylation of the FOXP3 enhancer CNS2, reinforcing FOXP3 expression. Conversely, overexpression of RBPJ potently suppressed FOXP3 induction through direct modulation of FOXP3 histone acetylation by HDAC3. Finally, RBPJ-ablated human iTreg cells more effectively suppressed xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease than control iTreg cells in a humanized mouse model. Together, our findings reveal novel regulators of FOXP3 and point towards new avenues to improve the efficacy of adoptive cell therapy for autoimmune disease. The RBPJ–NCOR repressor complex is identified as a negative regulator of FOXP3 expression through modulation of histone acetylation in induced regulatory T cells."

 Calorie-rich foods, particularly those that are high in fat and sugar, evoke pleasure in both humans and animals1. However, prolonged consumption of such foods may reduce their hedonic value, potentially contributing to obesity2–4. Here we investigated this phenomenon in mice on a chronic high-fat diet (HFD). Although these mice preferred high-fat food over regular chow in their home cages, they showed reduced interest in calorie-rich foods in a no-effort setting. This paradoxical decrease in hedonic feeding has been reported previously3–7, but its neurobiological basis remains unclear. We found that in mice on regular diet, neurons in the lateral nucleus accumbens (NAcLat) projecting to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) encoded hedonic feeding behaviours. In HFD mice, this behaviour was reduced and uncoupled from neural activity. Optogenetic stimulation of the NAcLat→VTA pathway increased hedonic feeding in mice on regular diet but not in HFD mice, though this behaviour was restored when HFD mice returned to a regular diet. HFD mice exhibited reduced neurotensin expression and release in the NAcLat→VTA pathway. Furthermore, neurotensin knockout in the NAcLat and neurotensin receptor blockade in the VTA each abolished optogenetically induced hedonic feeding behaviour. Enhancing neurotensin signalling via overexpression normalized aspects of diet-induced obesity, including weight gain and hedonic feeding. Together, our findings identify a neural circuit mechanism that links the devaluation of hedonic foods with obesity. In mice, prolonged consumption of a high-fat diet decreases interest in calorie-rich foods as a result of reduced neurotensin expression and signalling, which uncouples hedonic feeding behaviour linked to neurons projecting from lateral nucleus accumbens to ventral tegmental area."

 The membrane (M) protein of betacoronaviruses is well conserved and has a key role in viral assembly1,2. Here we describe the identification of JNJ-9676, a small-molecule inhibitor targeting the coronavirus M protein. JNJ-9676 demonstrates in vitro nanomolar antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and sarbecovirus strains from bat and pangolin zoonotic origin. Using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we determined a binding pocket of JNJ-9676 formed by the transmembrane domains of the M protein dimer. Compound binding stabilized the M protein dimer in an altered conformational state between its long and short forms, preventing the release of infectious virus. In a pre-exposure Syrian golden hamster model, JNJ-9676 (25 mg per kg twice per day) showed excellent efficacy, illustrated by a significant reduction in viral load and infectious virus in the lung by 3.5 and 4 log10-transformed RNA copies and 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) per mg lung, respectively. Histopathology scores at this dose were reduced to the baseline. In a post-exposure hamster model, JNJ-9676 was efficacious at 75 mg per kg twice per day even when added at 48 h after infection, when peak viral loads were observed. The M protein is an attractive antiviral target to block coronavirus replication, and JNJ-9676 represents an interesting chemical series towards identifying clinical candidates addressing the current and future coronavirus pandemics.

 Vision provides animals with detailed information about their surroundings and conveys diverse features such as colour, form and movement across the visual scene. Computing these parallel spatial features requires a large and diverse network of neurons. Consequently, from flies to humans, visual regions in the brain constitute half its volume. These visual regions often have marked structure–function relationships, with neurons organized along spatial maps and with shapes that directly relate to their roles in visual processing. More than a century of anatomical studies have catalogued in detail cell types in fly visual systems1–3, and parallel behavioural and physiological experiments have examined the visual capabilities of flies. To unravel the diversity of a complex visual system, careful mapping of the neural architecture matched to tools for targeted exploration of this circuitry is essential. Here we present a connectome of the right optic lobe from a male Drosophila melanogaster acquired using focused ion beam milling and scanning electron microscopy. We established a comprehensive inventory of the visual neurons and developed a computational framework to quantify their anatomy. Together, these data establish a basis for interpreting how the shapes of visual neurons relate to spatial vision. By integrating this analysis with connectivity information, neurotransmitter identity and expert curation, we classified the approximately 53,000 neurons into 732 types. These types are systematically described and about half are newly named. Finally, we share an extensive collection of split-GAL4 lines matched to our neuron-type catalogue. Overall, this comprehensive set of tools and data unlocks new possibilities for systematic investigations of vision in Drosophila and provides a foundation for a deeper understanding of sensory processing.

 Accurately interpreting medical images and generating insightful narrative reports is indispensable for patient care but places heavy burdens on clinical experts. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI), especially in an area that we refer to as multimodal generative medical image interpretation (GenMI), create opportunities to automate parts of this complex process. In this Perspective, we synthesize progress and challenges in developing AI systems for generation of medical reports from images. We focus extensively on radiology as a domain with enormous reporting needs and research efforts. In addition to analysing the strengths and applications of new models for medical report generation, we advocate for a novel paradigm to deploy GenMI in a manner that empowers clinicians and their patients. Initial research suggests that GenMI could one day match human expert performance in generating reports across disciplines, such as radiology, pathology and dermatology. However, formidable obstacles remain in validating model accuracy, ensuring transparency and eliciting nuanced impressions. If carefully implemented, GenMI could meaningfully assist clinicians in improving quality of care, enhancing medical education, reducing workloads, expanding specialty access and providing real-time expertise.

Smooth turnovers of their UV continua have been interpreted as damping-wing absorption of Lyman-α (Ly-α), the principal hydrogen transition6–9. However, spectral signatures encoding crucial properties of these sources, such as their emergent radiation field, largely remain elusive. Here we report spectroscopy from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES10) of a galaxy at redshift z = 13.0 that reveals a singular, bright emission line unambiguously identified as Ly-α, as well as a smooth turnover. We observe an equivalent width of EWLy-α > 40 Å (rest frame), previously only seen at z < 9 where the intervening intergalactic medium becomes increasingly ionized11. Together with an extremely blue UV continuum, the unexpected Ly-α emission indicates that the galaxy is a prolific producer and leaker of ionizing photons. This suggests that massive, hot stars or an active galactic nucleus have created an early reionized region to prevent complete extinction of Ly-α, thus shedding new light on the nature of the earliest galaxies and the onset of reionization only 330 Myr after the Big Bang. Spectroscopy from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey of a galaxy at redshift 13 shows a singular, bright emission line identified as Lyman-α, suggesting the onset of reionization only 330 Myr after the Big Bang."

 CD8+ T cell immune responses are critical for combating infectious diseases and tumours1–3. Antigen cross-presentation, primarily occurring at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of dendritic cells, is essential for protein-based vaccines to induce CD8+ T cell responses4. Current efforts have focused on antigen delivery at the tissue and cellular levels, whereas subcellular delivery has been limited to facilitating antigen escape from lysosomes into the cytosol. In the absence of a small-sized high-affinity ER-targeting molecule, the importance of the ‘last mile’ from the cytosol to the ER remains elusive. Here we developed stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist-based ER-targeting molecules (SABER), which effectively deliver antigens to the ER and cluster key machinery in cross-presentation to form microreactors by folding the ER membrane. Conjugation of SABER to various antigens substantially enhances the induction of CD8+ T cell immune responses to tumour neoantigens and conserved viral epitopes, far exceeding that achieved by mixtures of antigens with STING agonists or conventional adjuvants. SABER also retains a potent adjuvant effect, effectively enhancing the ability of a SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies. This study provides a high-affinity ER-targeting delivery system and vaccine adjuvant, demonstrating that precise subcellular delivery targeting the last mile of cross-presentation can lead to a qualitative leap. STING agonist-based endoplasmic reticulum-targeting molecules can be conjugated directly onto antigens to deliver them to the cross-presentation pathway, improving CD8+ T cell responses against tumours and viruses."

Shaw;Bjorn Stevens,The other climate crisis,"The standard approach of climate science is showing signs of a crisis owing to the emergence of discrepancies and disruptions in recent years; this Perspective discusses the policy implications and the paths forward. 
 As Earth warms, regional climate signals are accumulating. Some signals, for example, land warming more than the ocean and the Arctic warming the most, were expected and successfully predicted. Underlying this success was the application of physical laws under the assumption that large and small spatial scales are well separated. This established what we call the standard approach, climate science’s dominant paradigm. With additional warming, however, discrepancies between real-world signals and expectations based on this standard approach are piling up, especially at regional scales. At the same time, disruptive computational approaches are advancing new paradigms. Philosophers of science characterize situations where accumulating discrepancies (anomalies) and disruptions lead to a loss of confidence in the dominant paradigm as a ‘crisis’. Here we articulate what we consider to be the dominant paradigm, or standard approach, and the discrepancies and disruptions that have emerged in recent years. The policy implications of a purported crisis are discussed, as well as paths forward, crisis or no crisis. These paths include using signals to test assumptions and processes driving a warming Earth for the first time, developing testable hypotheses, and revitalizing conceptual thinking by filling gaps across climate-system components and spatial scales.

 Although quantum computers can perform a wide range of practically important tasks beyond the abilities of classical computers1,2, realizing this potential remains a challenge. An example is to use an untrusted remote device to generate random bits that can be certified to contain a certain amount of entropy3. Certified randomness has many applications but is impossible to achieve solely by classical computation. Here we demonstrate the generation of certifiably random bits using the 56-qubit Quantinuum H2-1 trapped-ion quantum computer accessed over the Internet. Our protocol leverages the classical hardness of recent random circuit sampling demonstrations4,5: a client generates quantum ‘challenge’ circuits using a small randomness seed, sends them to an untrusted quantum server to execute and verifies the results of the server. We analyse the security of our protocol against a restricted class of realistic near-term adversaries. Using classical verification with measured combined sustained performance of 1.1 × 1018 floating-point operations per second across multiple supercomputers, we certify 71,313 bits of entropy under this restricted adversary and additional assumptions. Our results demonstrate a step towards the practical applicability of present-day quantum computers.

Here, the authors report lanthanide single atom catalysts with the transition ability from bridge to linear adsorption that exhibit efficient CO production. 
 Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have received increasing attention due to their 100% atomic utilization efficiency. The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to CO using SAC offers a promising approach for CO2 utilization, but achieving facile CO2 adsorption and CO desorption remains challenging for traditional SACs. Instead of singling out specific atoms, we propose a strategy utilizing atoms from the entire lanthanide (Ln) group to facilitate the CO2RR. Density functional theory calculations, operando spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy elucidate the bridging adsorption mechanism for a representative erbium (Er) single-atom catalyst. As a result, we realize a series of Ln SACs spanning 14 elements that exhibit CO Faradaic efficiencies exceeding 90%. The Er catalyst achieves a high turnover frequency of ~130,000 h−1 at 500 mA cm−2. Moreover, 34.7% full-cell energy efficiency and 70.4% single-pass CO2 conversion efficiency are obtained at 200 mA cm−2 with acidic electrolyte. This catalytic platform leverages the collective potential of the lanthanide group, introducing new possibilities for efficient CO2-to-CO conversion and beyond through the exploration of unique bonding motifs in single-atom catalysts.

 The coexistence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and depression is a prominent example of multimorbidity. In previous work, we reported the results of a completed cluster-randomized controlled trial that was conducted in eight community health centers in China. We enrolled adults (≥18 years) with type 2 diabetes and depressive symptoms. In the intervention group, a comprehensive care plan was developed based on the Integrated Care Model for Patients with Diabetes and Depression (CIC-PDD). In this study, we explore the cost-effectiveness of the CIC-PDD by conducting a one-year within-trial economic evaluation from the health system, multipayer and societal perspectives. Health outcomes are quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and depression-free days (DFDs), and we calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and cost-effectiveness probability. Among 630 participants (275 intervention, 355 usual care), the cost per QALY gained is $7,922.82, $7,823.85, and $7,409.46, with cost-effectiveness probabilities of 66.41%- 94.45%. The cost per DFD is $2.63–$2.82, requiring a willingness-to-pay of $9.00–$10.50 for >95% probability of cost-effectiveness.

This study shows that northern hemisphere vegetation has been increasingly sensitive to flash droughts with faster declining rates since the early 2000s. 
 Climate change has led to the transition of droughts into rapid and intensified phenomena known as flash droughts, presenting considerable challenges for risk management, particularly concerning their impact on ecosystem productivity. Quantifying the ecosystem’s capacity to maintain productivity during flash droughts, referred to as ecosystem resistance, is crucial to assess drought impacts. However, it remains uncertain how the resistance of ecosystem productivity to flash drought changes over time. Here we show that vegetation resistance to flash droughts declines by up to 27% (±5%) over the Northern Hemisphere hotspots during 2001-2022, including eastern Asia, western North America, and northern Europe. The notable decline in vegetation resistance is mainly attributed to increased vapour pressure deficit and temperature, and enhanced vegetation structural sensitivity to water availability. Flash droughts pose higher ecological risks than slowly-developing droughts during the growing seasons, where ecosystem productivity experiences faster decline rates with a shorter response time. Our results underscore the limited ecosystem capacity to resist flash droughts under climate change. More frequent rapid-onset droughts, “flash droughts”, threaten ecosystem stability in a warming climate.

 The Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT) is a key protein contributing to resistance against the antimalarial chloroquine (CQ). Mutations such as K76T enable PfCRT to transport CQ away from its target in the parasite’s digestive vacuole, but this comes at a cost to its natural peptide transport function. This creates fitness costs which can drive changes to drug susceptibility in parasite populations, but the molecular basis of this is not well understood. To investigate, here we run 130 μs of molecular dynamics simulations of CQ-sensitive and CQ-resistant PfCRT isoforms with CQ and peptide substrates. We identify the CQ binding site and characterized diverse peptide binding modes. The K76T mutation allows CQ to access the binding site but disrupts peptide binding, highlighting the importance of cavity charge in determining substrate specificity. This study provides insight into PfCRT polyspecific peptide transport and will aid in rational, structure-based inhibitor design.

 The structure and function of membrane proteins depend on their interactions with lipids that constitute membranes. Actinoporins are α-pore-forming proteins that bind preferentially to sphingomyelin-containing membranes, where they oligomerize and form transmembrane pores. Through a comprehensive cryo-electron microscopic analysis of a pore formed by an actinoporin Fav from the coral Orbicella faveolata, we show that the octameric pore interacts with 112 lipids in the upper leaflet of the membrane, reveal the roles of lipids, and demonstrate that the actinoporin surface is suited for binding multiple receptor sphingomyelin molecules. When cholesterol is present in the membrane, it forms a cluster of four molecules associated with each protomer. Atomistic simulations support the structural data and reveal additional effects of the pore on the lipid membrane.

Here, the authors propose and demonstrate a way to embed noise characterisation in classical shadow estimation of nonlocal properties, enabling an efficient way to extract information from noisy quantum systems. 
 Extracting information efficiently from quantum systems is crucial for quantum information processing. Classical shadows enable predicting many properties of arbitrary quantum states using few measurements. While random single-qubit measurements are experimentally friendly and suitable for learning low-weight Pauli observables, they perform poorly for nonlocal observables. Introducing a shallow random quantum circuit before measurements improves sample efficiency for high-weight Pauli observables and low-rank properties. However, in practice, these circuits can be noisy and bias the measurement results. Here, we propose the robust shallow shadows, which employs Bayesian inference to learn and mitigate noise in postprocessing. We analyze noise effects on sample complexity and the optimal circuit depth. We provide theoretical guarantees for the success of error mitigation under a wide class of noise processes. Experimental validation on a superconducting quantum processor confirms the advantage of our method, even in the presence of realistic noise, over single-qubit measurements for predicting diverse state properties, such as fidelity and entanglement entropy. Our protocol thus offers a scalable, robust, and sample-efficient method for quantum state characterization on near-term quantum devices.

 Tritiated water emissions from nuclear facilities pose significant environmental risks and threaten the sustainability of nuclear energy. However, deep detritiation remains a major challenge due to the nearly indistinguishable physicochemical properties among water isotopologues. Here we present an efficient hydrogen isotope separation process based on catalytic proton exchange. The unique catalysis-promoted proton-transfer pathway found in a metal–organic framework (MIL-101(Cr)) significantly lowers the isotope exchange energy barrier to a previously unachieved level. Incorporating MIL-101(Cr) into a water distillation (WD) system enables a solid–liquid–gas triphasic mass transfer that overcomes the thermodynamic constraints of traditional WD, which relies on a liquid–gas biphasic isotope exchange. The height equivalent to the theoretical plate of the established WD prototype fell by half compared to the existing WD systems, thus increasing the separation efficiency by over four orders of magnitude in a 10-m distillation tower. This work offers an industrially viable and scalable option for cleaning up tritiated water. It is extremely difficult to separate tritium from radioactively contaminated water.

 The microphysical process of glaciation in clouds plays a crucial role in determining cloud dynamics, precipitation, atmospheric heat budgets, and the water cycle. Utilizing a year of global satellite data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA2) reanalysis, this study investigates the impact of aerosols on glaciation temperature (Tg) in deep convective clouds. Our results highlight the critical role of cloud droplet effective radius (re) at –5 °C in determining the Tg, where a greater re at –5 °C (re-5) corresponds to a warmer Tg, indicating the dominant role of the cloud drop size rather than INP. Specifically, the accelerated glaciation process is primarily due to the presence of larger supercooled droplets that freeze more rapidly. Large supercooled cloud droplets may enhance the secondary Ice Process (SIP), which could mask the influence of ice nucleating particles (INPs) in primary ice nucleation. Notably, at a fixed re-5, increasing the concentration of both fine and coarse aerosols has a minimal impact on Tg, indicating that the influence of INPs is weaker compared to the effect of re-5 in determining cloud glaciation temperature. Consequently, aerosols functioning as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) substantially impact cloud glaciation rather than INP. Additionally, we observe that fine and coarse aerosols acting as CCN have significant yet opposing effects on re-5. Although fine and coarse aerosols impact re-5, the re-5 maintains a fairly consistent relationship with Tg. Based on these insights, a multiple linear regression model predicts Tg with a robust correlation coefficient of 0.87, serving as a reference for establishing a parameter space of Tg by re-5 and aerosols, which can be applied for improving climate and global models."

The detected eddy activity is closely linked to large-scale circulation features like gyres and the Antarctic Slope Current. Eddy activity exhibits a strong seasonal cycle in which the presence of sea ice decreases the eddy population and increases the proportion of anticyclones. Anthropogenic warming is projected to shift eddy activity from the Antarctic Circumpolar Current poleward, intensify eddy activity along the Antarctic Slope Current, and reduce the seasonal cycle affecting eddy population and rotational direction. Eddy activity in the high-latitude Southern Ocean is closely linked to large-scale circulation features, and the presence of sea ice both decreases eddy population and increases anticyclone proportion, according to a high-resolution modelling study."

 The Sustainable Development Goals Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1), equipped with the Glimmer Imager (GLI), provides high-resolution nighttime light (NTL) data across multiple spectral bands. Thus, it can notably monitor human dynamics and light pollution with enhanced spectral and spatial resolution. However, cloud cover and low-quality observations often contaminate the SDGSAT-1 GLI NTL data, limiting its effectiveness. This challenge is addressed by the development of a novel method, namely the SpatioTemporal And spectRal gap-filling method for Sdgsat-1 (STARS) GLI NTL images, which combines spatiotemporal and spectral information to generate cloud-free NTL images with satisfactory pixel brightness and continuity. STARS is the first method to effectively address gap-filling in multiband NTL data using RGB spectral information, even with irregular time intervals and limited image inputs. Compared with traditional methods such as the temporal gap-filling method and the mean-weighted gap-filling method, the Cloud Removing bY Synergizing spatioTemporAL information (CRYSTAL) method, and the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM), which do not specifically account for the differences in light source variations in multi-band NTL data, STARS demonstrates superior performance (higher R-squared (R2) and lower root-mean-square error (RMSE)) in simulations across seven global cities, demonstrating its effectiveness in filling cloud-induced gaps in multi-band NTL data. On average, STARS achieves R2 values for the gap-filling results compared to the actual values of 0.79, 0.78, and 0.70 in the RGB bands, respectively. The cloud-free images produced by STARS extend the time series of the SDGSAT-1 GLI NTL data, supporting multitemporal quantitative analysis. In cloudy regions like Tianjin, China, STARS effectively captures dynamic changes in NTL before and after the Spring Festival, closely matching human activity patterns from Baidu Maps, both spatially and temporally. Overall, STARS offers an innovative and effective approach for gap-filling multiband NTL data, with potential applications in similar datasets."

 Dust is one of the key factors influencing photovoltaic (PV) power generation. The ability to accurately capture PV dust information is essential for PV operation and sustainable utilization. This study employs uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) hyperspectral imaging to monitor PV dust deposition. To address the problems of information redundancy in hyperspectral data and the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) easily falling into local optimum, a high-precision UAV hyperspectral PV dust estimation method is proposed. The fractional order derivative (FOD) is applied to the spectral reflectance of PV dust accumulation, and a PV dust estimation model with sine map tuna swarm optimized backpropagation neural network (STSO-BPNN) is established, which is validated using UAV hyperspectral images and ground measured dust data. The results show that FOD improves the spectral signal-to-noise ratio, and the 0.2 order STSO-BPNN model achieves higher accuracy (R2 = 0.95, RMSE = 0.79 g/m2, RPIQ = 7.98). These findings provide a scientific basis for the rapid and accurate estimation and mapping of PV dust accumulation while proposing a novel strategy for efficient PV implementation and management."

 High-quality, full-coverage topographic bathymetric data is crucial for marine economic development and ecological environment protection. Due to the complex environment of land-sea transition zone, it is challenging to acquire comprehensive bathymetric topography using a single sensor. Multiplatform topographic bathymetric technology, such as airborne LiDAR bathymetry (ALB) and multibeam echo sounding (MBES), whose point clouds can be integrated to construct a complete model of land-sea transition zone. However, point cloud data from different sources may have certain differences in the digital description of the same target. Meanwhile, affected by factors such as registration error and sensor system error, there are data gaps in the registered point cloud, which hinders the subsequent reconstruction. To overcome these problems, a fusion method combining a pseudo-grid model is proposed to construct a high-quality, seamless topographic-bathymetric map. This paper’s contribution identifies non-overlapping ALB regions and generates anti-noise MBES simulated points (SPs) by constructing a pseudo-grid. Moreover, this paper focuses on establishing a point-to-SP model to eliminate the gaps and reduce the impact of registration errors on the fusion accuracy. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, four typical samples along with six reference samples exhibiting diverse features collected from Ganquan Island in the South China Sea are utilized in the experiment. The results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve ideal results in terms of the average root mean square error (RMSE) of the six reference samples, which is reduced from 0.41 m to 0.19 m. It is indicated that the true topography can be restored and the proposed method has advantages in accuracy and robustness."

 Water depth (H), bottom reflectance (Rbλ), chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl) and seawater transparency (SDD) are key parameters in assessing shallow benthic habitats. However, due to limited in-situ data, restricted hyperspectral imagery or dynamic water quality, it is challenging to develop a generalized remote sensing model for decoupling water column and benthic signals across diverse regions and time periods. In this study, a Modified Log rotation Ratio and Semi-analytical (MLR-S) model is proposed for diffuse attenuation coefficient Kdλ retrieval by adjusting inherent optical properties (P, G, X), from widely used four-band multispectral images without relying on truth data. A new Binary Quadratic Polynomial Relationship (BQPR) between P and the logarithmic values of blue-green bands was developed upon a sparse set of self-inferred points (SIPs). Then, large-scale and optimal Kdλ was determined. Finally, using the monthly mean water column reflectance dataset MMCRwλ constructed from 23-year MODIS data, Rbλ, Chl and SDD can be efficiently derived. Synchronous validation at Dazhou Island confirmed the effectiveness of the MLR-S model, with mean relative errors of 23.77%, 15.26% and 9.91% for blue, green and red Rb, respectively, and 36.69% for Chl. Further validation of Rbλ in Heron Reef, Aitutaki Island and Buck Island demonstrated the model’s robustness across diverse habitats. Compared to the ICESat-2 Along Track Benthic Reflectance (ATBR) model, the MLR-S model yielded more reasonable and reliable Rbλ in deeper waters. Additionally, it outperformed the traditional semi-analytical model, achieving greater accuracy while being over 100 times more computationally efficient. This model offers promising potential for large-scale, high-resolution monitoring of benthic habitats using four-band multispectral data, supporting improved understanding of reef health and informed decision-making."

 Mapping environmental variables is crucial for natural resource management. Researchers and scholars have continually advanced this field with modern techniques such as Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA), Deep Learning (DL), and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) models. While effective, these models often present a significant challenge due to their black nature, which obscures the process of generating final maps from raw data. Recent theoretical breakthroughs have shown that white/grey-box models can achieve the same level of accuracy as these advanced techniques, debunking the belief that complex models are necessarily the most accurate. Based on these findings, we have developed a methodology that employs a series of statistical tests and data analytics to identify essential features hidden in spatial data in order to assess the predictive model (of white/grey kind) that best approximates underlying spatial processes. This methodology profiles the model that better adapts to the data, aiding in the selection of the simplest model that achieves the desired accuracy, functioning similarly to a recommender system for model selection. Furthermore, the set of permissible models includes only regressive-like ones to clarify the data’s contribution to map construction and can be applied to a wide range of datasets. By reducing complexity, this approach enhances the transparency of the model’s results. Real-world dataset demonstrates this methodology’s remarkable ability to produce highly accurate results."

 Mapping forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for monitoring forest ecosystems and assessing the success of conservation initiatives such as the REDD + carbon projects. Traditional field-based approaches to measuring AGB, however, face significant challenges, due to high financial costs and logistical constraints. Remote sensing, including both active and passive sensors, presents a promising and cost-effective alternative, yet its practical utility and accuracy for capturing forest AGB in diverse and complex ecosystems remains largely unexplored. This research used an extensive national forest inventory (NFI) dataset to evaluate the ability to map the AGB of the Miombo woodlands in Zambia across four agro-ecological zones using both multi-seasonal SAR (Sentinel-1A) and optical (Landsat-8 OLI) imagery. A multi-level experiment was designed to (i) compare the accuracy of AGB estimation using SAR and optical data when used independently, and in combination, using a Random Forest regression model, (ii) assess the effect of seasonality on the accuracy of AGB estimation when using SAR and optical datasets, and (iii) evaluate the effect of variation in climatic and environmental conditions on AGB estimation. Experimental results show that multi-seasonal images (across the rainy, hot and dry seasons) outperformed single-season and annual images. Combining SAR backscatter in the hot season, optical bands in the dry season, and vegetation indices in the hot season produced the most accurate AGB model (R = 0.69, MAE = 14.01 Mg ha−1 and RMSE = 18.23 Mg ha−1). The models performed distinctly across different agro-ecological zones (R = 0.44 – 0.79), suggesting that fitting local models could be beneficial. These results based on the extensive NFI of Zambia demonstrate that seasonal effects and fitting local models can lead to more accurate AGB estimation within the Miombo woodlands, which is of significance for ongoing REDD + carbon projects in Zambia and other African countries."

 Validating forest cover maps is essential for evidence-based conservation and sustaining ecosystem services. However, complex spatial patterns in fragmented tropical forest landscapes—often comprising non-contiguous forest patches, interspersed with agricultural lands and other land cover types—pose considerable difficulties for accuracy assessment using conventional techniques. To address this, we developed an integrated object-based sampling (IOBS) method that combines stratified random sampling, proportional allocation, and sample distance optimization. The IOBS method was applied to assess the accuracy of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) global 25 m PALSAR-2/PALSAR forest/non-forest (FNF) 2020 map across 14 ecoregions in Nigeria. Its performance was compared to simple random, systematic, and stratified random sampling using the coefficient of variation (CV), heterogeneity index (HI), and true accuracy metrics. IOBS demonstrated substantially higher spatial variability (CV = 109.37) and heterogeneity (HI = 0.21) compared to other methods (CV = 28.84–53.93, HI = 0.05–0.11). The IOBS estimated an accuracy of 81.1 %, closely aligning with the true accuracy of 82.4 % and outperforming other methods (75.3 %–79.7 %). The higher performance of IOBS stems from its ability to capture a broad range of forest conditions—from extensive contiguous cover to small, fragmented patches—while minimizing spatial autocorrelation through distance optimization. By better representing local heterogeneity, IOBS offers a robust and precise framework for validating categorical forest cover maps in complex tropical landscapes, advancing accuracy assessment practices for remote sensing applications."

Our analysis shows that NAT10-dependent ac4C-acetylation is robust in rRNA and specific tRNAs but low/spurious in mRNA. It also revealed an inflammatory signature and mutagenesis at transcriptionally active sites in NAT10-KO cells. This finding led us to explore the role of NAT10 in R-loops, which were recently linked to APOBEC3B-mediated mutagenesis. Our analysis showed that R-loops are ac4C-acetylated in a NAT10-dependent manner. Furthermore, NAT10 restrains the levels of R-loops at a subset of differentially expressed genes in a catalytic activity–dependent manner.

Unexpectedly, ATG8/LC3 lipidation did not target Mtb to lysosomes, excluding the canonical xenophagy.

Additionally, we have developed ratiometric afterglow nanoparticles doped with oxidative stress–responsive molecules, enabling imaging of oxidative stress markers in atherosclerotic plaque. This approach provides a tool for cardiovascular imaging and diagnostics, which is conducive to the auxiliary diagnosis and risk stratification of atherosclerosis."

Despite its importance, the mechanisms regulating this process remain largely elusive. We identify serine-260 (S260) as a critical phosphorylation site in Toc33, a core TOC component. This phosphorylation stabilizes Toc33 by preventing its ubiquitination and degradation. Constitutive triple response 1 (CTR1), a negative regulator of ethylene signaling, and its paralog RAF-like kinase are involved in phosphorylating Toc33. Disruption of Toc33 phosphorylation impairs its stability and photosynthetic protein import, consequently affecting chloroplast structural integrity and biogenesis. Our findings underscore the essential role of TOC phosphorylation in chloroplast biogenesis and reveal an unexpected regulatory network involving RAF-like kinases in organelle development."

Intravenously administered pYSMs home passively to pancreatic tumor xenografts and, upon 10 gray irradiation, cause significant tumor regression (P< 0.01). On combining XPDT with anti-PD1 immunotherapy, a distant nonirradiated tumor also regresses via an increase in intratumoral activated CD8+cytotoxic T cells. Collectively, we advance a systemically delivered XPDT strategy that mediates an antitumor effect in both irradiated and nonirradiated (abscopal) tumors when coupled with immunotherapy, converting an immunologically “cold” tumor to an immunologically “hot” tumor."

Using automated microinjection into apical progenitors (APs) of embryonic mouse neocortex and electroporation of APs in chimpanzee cerebral organoids, we show thatNBPF14promotes the delamination of AP progeny, by promoting oblique cleavage plane orientation during AP division, leading to increased abundance of the key basal progenitor type, basal radial glia. In contrast,NOTCH2NLBpromotes AP proliferation, leading to expansion of the AP pool. When expressed together,NBPF14andNOTCH2NLBexert coordinated effects, resulting in expansion of basal progenitors while maintaining self-renewal of APs. Hence, these two human-specific genes orchestrate the behavior of APs, and the lineages of their progeny, in a manner essential for the evolutionary expansion of the human neocortex."

At templated AP sites, cross-links between the DNA and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine binding, embryonic stem cell–specific (HMCES) regulate replication fork speed, avoiding cytotoxic double-strand breaks. While the role of HMCES at the template DNA strand is well studied, its effects on nascent DNA are not. We provide evidence that HMCES–DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) are detrimental to the BER-mediated removal of 5-hydroxymethyl-2′-deoxycytidine (5hmdC)–derived 5-hydroxymethyl-2′-deoxyuridine from replication forks. HRD cells have heightened HMCES-DPCs, which increase further upon 5hmdC exposure, suggesting that HMCES binds both spontaneous and 5hmdC-induced AP sites. HMCES depletion substantially suppresses 5hmdC-mediated replication fork defects, chromosomal aberrations, and cell death in HRD cells. This reveals that HMCES-DPCs are a source of BER-initiated single-stranded DNA gaps, which indicates that endogenous DPCs contribute to genomic instability in HRD tumors."

Yuan,Histone modification–driven structural remodeling unleashes DNMT3B in DNA methylation,"The DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) plays a vital role in shaping DNA methylation patterns during mammalian development. DNMT3B is intricately regulated by histone H3 modifications, yet the dynamic interplay between DNMT3B and histone modifications remains enigmatic. Here, we demonstrate that the PWWP (proline-tryptophan-tryptophan-proline) domain within DNMT3B exhibits remarkable dynamics that enhances the enzyme’s methyltransferase activity upon interactions with a modified histone H3 peptide (H3K4me0K36me3). In the presence of H3K4me0K36me3, both the PWWP and ADD (ATRX-DNMT3-DNMT3L) domains transition from autoinhibitory to active conformations. In this active state, the PWWP domain most often aligns closely with the catalytic domain, allowing for simultaneous interactions with H3 and DNA to stimulate DNA methylation. The prostate cancer–associated DNMT3B R545C mutant is even more dynamic and susceptible to adopting the active conformation, resulting in aberrant DNA hypermethylation. Our study suggests the mechanism by which conformational rearrangements in DNMT3B are triggered by histone modifications, ultimately unleashing its activity in DNA methylation."

Existing technologies, however, lack comprehensive monitoring of the microvascular network, which is linked to conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and small vessel diseases. This study introduces an ultrasound approach using a capacitive micromachined ultrasound transducer row-column array for continuous, ultrasensitive three-dimensional (3D) Doppler imaging of microvascular changes such as hemodynamic variations or vascular remodeling. In vitro tests and in vivo studies with healthy volunteers demonstrated the sensor’s ability to image the 3D microvascular network at high resolution over different timescales with automatic registration and to detect microvascular changes with high sensitivity. Integrating this technology into wearable devices could, one day, enhance understanding, monitoring, and possibly early detection of microvascular-related health conditions."

Kwan,Frontal noradrenergic and cholinergic transients exhibit distinct spatiotemporal dynamics during competitive decision-making,"Norepinephrine (NE) and acetylcholine (ACh) are crucial for learning and decision-making. In the cortex, NE and ACh are released transiently at specific sites along neuromodulatory axons, but how the spatiotemporal patterns of NE and ACh signaling link to behavioral events is unknown. Here, we use two-photon microscopy to visualize neuromodulatory signals in the premotor cortex (medial M2) as mice engage in a competitive matching pennies game. Spatially, NE signals are more segregated with choice and outcome encoded at distinct locations, whereas ACh signals can multiplex and reflect different behavioral correlates at the same site. Temporally, task-driven NE transients were more synchronized and peaked earlier than ACh transients. To test functional relevance, we stimulated neuromodulatory signals using optogenetics to find that NE, but not ACh, increases the animals’ propensity to explore alternate options. Together, the results reveal distinct subcellular spatiotemporal patterns of ACh and NE transients during decision-making in mice."

Ephexin5, a RhoGEF implicated in the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease and Angelman syndrome, was originally reported in neurons as a RhoA-specific GEF that negatively regulates spine synapse density. Here, we show that Ephexin5 activates both RhoA and Cdc42 in the brain. Furthermore, using live imaging of GTPase biosensors, we demonstrate that Ephexin5 regulates activity-dependent Cdc42, but not RhoA, signaling at single synapses. The selectivity of Ephexin5 for Cdc42 activation is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, which is regulated by neuronal activity. Last, in contrast to Ephexin5’s role in negatively regulating synapse density, we show that, downstream of neuronal activity, Ephexin5 positively regulates synaptic growth and stabilization. Our results support a model in which plasticity-inducing neuronal activity regulates Ephexin5 tyrosine phosphorylation, driving Ephexin5-mediated activation of Cdc42 and the spine structural growth and stabilization vital for learning."

Here, we examine whether biotic homogenization can be explained by tropical survivors tracking an expansion of their preferred habitat, measured in terms of the ratio of environmental oxygen supply to metabolic demand. We compare spatial similarity in community composition among marine invertebrate fossils represented by bivalve and gastropod fossils with predictions from an ecophysiological model of habitat that diagnoses areas in the ocean that can sustain the aerobic requirements of marine invertebrates. Modeled biogeographic responses to climate change yield an increase in global similarity of community composition among surviving ecophysiotypes, consistent with patterns in the fossil record and arguing for a physiological control on earliest Triassic biogeography."

Although extensive research has explored the effects of chemical composition and exterior conditions on self-assembly, a systematic study consolidating these data to uncover global rules is lacking. In this work, we curate a peptide assembly database through a combination of manual processing by human experts and large language model–assisted literature mining. As a result, we collect over 1000 experimental data entries with information about peptide sequence, experimental conditions, and corresponding self-assembly phases. Using the data, machine learning models are developed, demonstrating excellent accuracy (>80%) in assembly phase classification. Moreover, we fine-tune a GPT model for peptide literature mining with the developed dataset, which markedly outperforms the pretrained model in extracting information from academic publications. This workflow can improve efficiency when exploring potential self-assembling peptide candidates, through guiding experimental work, while also deepening our understanding of the governing mechanisms."
