10.1088/1748-9326/ae151e,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要关注干旱的传播动态，利用因果推理方法分析气象干旱、农业干旱和水文干旱之间的关系。研究使用了CLM5模型进行干旱估计，并结合PCMCI-CMIsymb方法检测非线性因果关系，以及因果效应分析量化传播概率。虽然涉及水文气象变量，但核心内容与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关联，因此不属于该领域。,[],Min Pang;Shuai Yang,Unraveling drought propagation dynamics using causal inference from time series,"Drought is a pervasive natural hazard that propagates through the hydrologic cycle, leading to water deficiencies across key hydroclimatic variables such as precipitation, streamflow, and soil moisture. However, understanding the intricate dynamics of drought propagation remains challenging because of spatiotemporal variability and interactions among multiple drought types, including meteorological drought (MD), agricultural drought (AD), and hydrological drought (HD). Traditional analytical methods struggle to capture these complexities, particularly when using high-dimensional time series data characterized by nonlinear causality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cause–effect-based framework that integrates the process-based Community Land Model (CLM5), a causal inference method (Peter–Clark momentary conditional independence (PCMCI)-CMIsymb), and causal effect (CE) analysis to investigate drought propagation across multiple time scales (1, 3, 6, and 12 months) in the Yellow River Basin (YRB), China. CLM5 provides high-resolution spatiotemporal drought estimations, PCMCI-CMIsymb detects nonlinear causal relationships, and CE analysis quantifies propagation probabilities across varying time lags. The results demonstrate that (a) drought propagation patterns vary by time scale, with short-term (1 month) propagation occurring primarily from MD to AD, whereas long-term (12 month) propagation extends from MD to both AD and HD; (b) subregional HDs tend to influence each other across regions, with stronger interconnections observed at long-term time scales; and (c) the likelihood of drought propagation differs spatially, with higher probabilities of MD propagation into AD and HD in the middle and lower YRB at the 6 month time scale, mostly peaking at 40%–60% with a 1 month lag. This study presents an advanced analytical framework for drought assessment, providing insights for improving drought mitigation and water resource management, particularly in regions affected by spatial hydroclimatic variability."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae1754,True,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文探讨了在厄尔尼诺条件下，海洋性大陆（MC）的生物质燃烧气溶胶如何影响MJO（Madden-Julian振荡）的传播。研究发现，厄尔尼诺现象加剧了MC地区的干燥，导致野火增多，气溶胶浓度升高。高浓度的气溶胶通过吸收太阳辐射，改变了边界层温度和大气稳定性，从而抑制了MJO对流的发展和东向传播。这项研究强调了气溶胶在MJO传播障碍效应中的作用，并暗示改进气候模型中气溶胶的模拟可以提高MJO的可预测性。由于该研究涉及气溶胶的观测、对大气成分的影响以及与气候模式的联系，因此与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['aerosols', 'biomass burning', 'air quality', 'atmospheric stability', 'satellite observations (implied)', 'atmospheric composition analysis (aerosol concentration)', 'MJO propagation', 'El Niño effects', 'aerosol-radiation-convection interactions']",Meiqiutong Ma;Tim Li;Pang-chi Hsu;Yan Zhu;Dong Guo,Maritime continent aerosols reinforce the MJO propagation barrier under El Niño conditions,"The Maritime Continent (MC), a critical region for Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) propagation, is also a global hotspot for biomass burning aerosol emissions. While the barrier effect on MJO propagation over the MC is well documented, the role of aerosols in this process and its underlying mechanisms remain unrevealed. Combining observations, reanalysis datasets and moisture budget diagnostics, this study demonstrates that absorbing aerosols from El Niño-enhanced wildfires significantly modulate MJO eastward propagation. During the boreal autumn (August–November), the peak season for aerosol loading, El Niño-induced subsidence over the MC exacerbates regional dryness and promotes widespread wildfires, further elevating aerosol concentrations. To isolate the aerosol impact from El Niño effects, we classified the MJO events under high- and low-aerosol conditions while controlling for similar Niño 3.4 sea surface temperature anomalies. Composite analyses reveal that the high aerosol loads disrupt the propagation of MJO convective envelopes, whereas MJO sustains eastward propagation under low-aerosol conditions. Mechanistically, enhanced shortwave absorption by elevated aerosols induces a boundary layer cold anomaly that suppresses low-level convergence, while simultaneous heating of the lower-to-mid troposphere enhances atmospheric stability. This combined thermal and thermodynamic effect weakens boundary layer moisture anomalies, inhibiting the development of shallow convection east of the MJO deep convection that is essential for sustained propagation. The findings highlight the overlooked role of MC aerosols in the MJO barrier effect via aerosol-radiation-convection interactions, suggesting that improved representation of aerosols in climate models may enhance MJO predictability."

Regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) are tasked with a UN dual-mandate to ensure the (1) long-term conservation of fish stocks and their associated ecosystems while managing the (2) sustainable use of high seas fisheries. Building on a previous analysis, we developed 10 questions each for our 10 categories (e.g. catch targets, transparency, bycatch). These 100 questions were both descriptive (e.g. are there quantitative results of bycatch improvement?) while others indicated intent (e.g. are there plans to rebuild all declining stocks?) and used publicly available information to evaluate 16 RFMOs (with a score of 0, 0.5, or 1). The average score for all RFMOs out of 100 was 46 (max 61.5, min 29.5). There were six questions for which all RFMOs received a 0, 90 questions for which at least one RFMO scored a one, and a ‘best case’ score of 76.5 that aggregated the highest RFMO score across the 10 categories. This indicates a competence gap; no RFMO is achieving what is empirically documented as possible in one RFMO or another. We also analyzed satellite-derived fishing activity and target stock status. Five RFMO convention areas had the highest overall and density of fishing effort. On average, 56% of stocks targeted in RFMO convention areas were considered overexploited or collapsed. We did not find that RFMO scores were correlated with better management outcomes (i.e. target stock status and fishing effort). However, we found correlations between better target stock status and questions assessing protected area adoption, banning transshipment at-sea, and reducing allowable catches in response to overfishing—policies that few RFMOs have fully adopted. These findings indicate ways for RFMOs to improve high seas fisheries management that are immediately available and effective."

Recent analyses of field experiments suggest that increasing crop rotational complexity (RC) builds resilience to climate change, especially when rotations include overwintering cover crops that assimilate and retain nutrients and increase organic matter inputs to soil. However, evidence from working farms is lacking. We used field-scale remote sensing to assess relationships between crop diversification and agroecosystem climate resilience from 2008 to 2019 in Michigan, the most agriculturally diverse state in the US Midwest. Using panel fixed effects models and linear regressions, we assessed how corn and soybean yield and temporal yield stability (measured as the coefficient of variation) respond to: (1) an index of crop RC that encompasses species turnover and functional diversity, and (2) replacing bare fallows with winter cover crops. We also tested how cover crops influence corn and soybean planting dates as an indicator of resilience to heavy spring rainfall. We found that crop diversification was linked to higher corn and soybean yields, but cover crops showed more promise for improving yield stability than overall RC. Cover crops reduced planting delays associated with heavy spring rainfall, and did not interfere with primary crop planting under average weather conditions. However, cover crop benefits for resilience took multiple years to appear on farms, highlighting the importance of technical and financial support during the early phases of transition. Together these findings may promote cover crop adoption by reducing concerns that cover crops interfere with primary crop planting, and instead showing that they are a crucial tool for minimizing risk from increasingly variable and extreme climatic conditions."

This study contributes new evidence to this body of literature by showing that heatwaves significantly reduce human mobility, a high-frequency indicator of economic activity and social interaction, in and between Chinese cities. Using a set of fixed-effects panel-regression models estimated with mobile phone-derived human mobility data, coupled with daily meteorological and air quality data, we find that heatwaves, on average, reduce the intracity trip rate and inbound trips in Chinese cities by 1.5% and 1.6%, respectively. Notably, nearly one-third of the heatwave-induced decline in the intracity trip rate can be attributed to the added effect of sustained periods of extreme heat beyond the temperature–mobility relationship. Back-of-the-envelope calculations based on these estimates suggest that the 2023 Chinese summer heatwave led to nationwide mobility reductions on a scale equivalent to suspending all intracity and inbound trips in Shanghai, one of China’s largest and busiest cities, for an entire week. Moreover, the adverse impacts of heatwaves on human mobility are particularly pronounced in cities of small size and with limited economic resources and green spaces, highlighting the urgent need to enhance the heatwave resilience of these cities."

We address this question using a global dataset covering national-level agri-environmental policies and regime transitions between autocracy and democracy from 1961 to 2021. Our empirical strategy employs a difference-in-differences estimator within an event-study framework to identify the causal impact of democratization on the adoption of agri-environmental policy measures. The results show that democratic transitions lead to a significant increase in the adoption of such policies. In the short to medium run (within six years), democratization causes a +25% increase in the number of agri-environmental policies compared to a counterfactual scenario under autocracy. In the long run, this effect persists and is likely to grow further. These newly implemented policies predominantly address biodiversity protection, fertilizer use, forest conservation, and soil erosion. We find no systematic evidence of heterogeneous effects among democracies based on characteristics such as government type, electoral system, levels of political corruption, or international integration. The relevance of these findings is heightened by current global political developments, as many democracies are experiencing institutional backsliding. Future research should directly examine how such developments influence the adoption of environmental policies."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae1e17,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究了如何利用卫星观测数据（包括TROPOMI和Himawari-8的数据）以及机器学习模型来提高中国山西省PM2.5浓度的估算精度。研究重点在于整合多种卫星数据，例如CO、NO2和紫外气溶胶指数，以改善空气质量监测。通过分析这些数据，研究揭示了PM2.5的时空分布特征，并探讨了工业活动对空气质量的影响，尤其是在中国新年期间。该研究表明，结合多传感器卫星观测和可解释的机器学习方法，可以有效地描述复杂工业区域的污染动态。,"['PM2.5', 'Air Quality Monitoring', 'Satellite Observations', 'Atmospheric Composition (CO, NO2, Aerosols)', 'TROPOMI', 'Himawari-8', 'Machine Learning', 'Spatial-temporal Analysis']",Junting Kang;Shuo Wang;Jason Cohen;Wenwen Wang;Lailiang Shi;Tao Wang;Qibin Sun;Jun Feng;Kai Qin,"Improving estimation of surface PM2.5 by including satellite observations of gases, aerosols, and radiation in tandem","Shanxi Province, a major hub of coal production and industrial activity in China, faces severe PM2.5 pollution and complex co-emission sources that challenge air quality monitoring. This study developed multiple machine learning models to estimate daily PM2.5 concentrations in 2022 by integrating ground-based PM2.5 observations, Himawari-8 measurements, CO, NO2 and ultraviolet aerosol index (UVAI) derived from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), and ERA5. Ten-fold cross-validation showed that incorporating TROPOMI-derived CO, NO2 and UVAI produced the highest predictive performance, reducing root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) by 14% and 16% respectively. Meanwhile, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis and partial dependence analysis identified CO as the most important species driving PM2.5 prediction, with all three variables showing positive contributions to PM2.5 that increased with higher values. This emphasis on the importance of CO and NO2 is physically realistic given that CO is co-emitted with primary aerosols, and NO2 is a secondary aerosol precursor. However, such work has not been previously considered by the community focusing on surface PM2.5 prediction using AI models and satellite observations. The model revealed pronounced spatiotemporal gradients in PM2.5 across Shanxi, peaking in the final 5 weeks before Chinese New Year (62.0 μg m−3), and minimizing in summer (21.0 μg m−3), while remaining persistently high in southern and eastern industrial regions. The steady PM2.5 rise in the final 5 weeks before Chinese New Year, suggesting that pre-holiday production activities may contribute to short-term emission intensification, while demonstrating that traditional season-based analysis approaches may miss these extremes. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating multi-sensor satellite observations with interpretable machine learning for characterizing pollution dynamics in complex industrial regions."

However, photosynthetic duration is often overestimated, particularly in autumn, as greenness and photosynthesis tend to decouple. This highlights the need for a more precise understanding of autumn photosynthetic phenology to refine global carbon assessments. In this study, we estimated the end-of-photosynthesis date (EOP) across the Northern Hemisphere (>30° N) from 2001 to 2021 using satellite-derived solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence and flux tower observations. We then analyzed EOP’s spatiotemporal variations and identified its primary biome-specific drivers. Our results reveal a widespread advancement of EOP, except in water-limited biomes, with the most pronounced shifts in colder regions such as boreal forests and tundra. These shifts are mainly driven by the carryover effects of earlier photosynthetic onset and early-season warming, which are likely influenced by leaf lifespan and sink capacity. Nutrient limitation may further exacerbate sink constraints, particularly in colder biomes. The effects of earlier photosynthetic onset and early-season warming counteract the delaying influence of late-season warming on EOP. The significant advancement of early-stage EOP (EOP75) indicates that early-season drivers have a stronger effect than late-season delays, while late-stage EOP (EOP25) remains nearly unchanged due to a balance of opposing forces. Consequently, the limited photosynthetic gains from an earlier or unchanged EOP may fail to offset respiratory carbon losses, potentially weakening the Northern Hemisphere’s carbon sink capacity and complicating future carbon-climate feedback projections."

Increasing water demands and climate variability, however, are accelerating the exploitation of this resource in many regions, often beyond environmentally sustainable limits. In this study, we present the first global-scale assessment of sustainable groundwater head declines, defined as the maximum permissible drop in groundwater head that avoids environmental harm. With a global-scale hydrological-groundwater model coupling (VIC-WUR-MODFLOW) at 5 arcmin resolution, we simulated groundwater discharge and head under natural conditions. Using these values, we isolated mean groundwater levels during low-flow, intermediate-flow, and high-flow periods to estimate historic sustainable groundwater head declines. We compared our estimates with observations and simulations to assess the historic sustainability of groundwater use practices. Globally, the median sustainable groundwater head decline was 4.5 m between 1984–2018. Tropical regions (e.g. Amazon Basin, southeast Asia) exhibited greater sustainably available groundwater due to high recharge, while arid regions (e.g. western United States, South Africa) exhibited limited capacities. Comparisons with historic groundwater head revealed that several key agricultural regions (e.g. Indo-Gangetic Plain, North China Plain, Central Valley) exceeded sustainable limits by more than 20 m, corresponding to overexploitations of sustainable resources by more than 150%. In contrast, much of Europe and North America remained within sustainable boundaries when assessed at the aquifer-scale, although localized overexploitation was still evident. We also identified emerging hotspots (e.g. Iran, northern Africa) where groundwater head declines approached sustainable thresholds over the study period. As freshwater demands continue to rise, these regions may become future hotspots of unsustainable groundwater use without intervention. This study provides a novel global methodology to quantify environmentally sustainable groundwater resources, offering insight into at-risk regions and supporting informed water resources management under future pressures."

How accounting for technology differences at utility scale solar energy facilities can change data interpretation,"As the fastest growing energy source in the United States, utility scale solar energy (USSE) features prominently in the scientific literature, particularly regarding the ‘lake effect hypothesis’, which posits that water birds perceive USSE as water bodies, are subsequently attracted to them, and experience mortality as a result. Policymakers and environmental regulators rely on research to evaluate and publicly disclose the impacts of emerging technologies on wildlife and to craft appropriate avoidance, minimization, and mitigation measures. We completed a literature review and summarized data from two papers to better understand how technology type influences conclusions regarding bird mortality at USSE facilities. We found 16 papers addressing bird mortality at USSE primarily from the United States where authors pooled data across fixed-tilt and single-axis tracker panel photovoltaic (PV) facilities, despite fixed-tilt facilities trending substantially downward in installed capacity in the U.S. in the last 10 years. Our summary revealed that data to support the lake effect hypothesis is sparse when data from fixed-tilt panel facilities developed prior to the commercial transition to anti-reflective coating (ARC) are separated from tracker panel facilities. A dataset from a single fixed-tilt PV facility built prior to the ARC transition was used in eight papers and cited by 14 of the 16 papers that discussed aquatic bird mortality. This single dataset underpins the entire lake effect hypothesis discussion in the scientific literature. Despite this facility being unrepresentative of current USSE facilities, conclusions drawn from these data have been broadly applied to all PV USSE facilities. Overall, our findings show that it is important for researchers to separate data by technology type, and for regulators to understand that avian mortality trends associated with older solar facilities might not be applicable to modern USSE installations."

Yet, unlike air pollution, which is enjoying relatively more public attention, there is limited measurement data and policy efforts on environmental noise pollution. We followed a recent city-wide measurement approach used in Accra (Ghana) and characterized environmental noise patterns in Kigali, a contrasting city with very different topography and regulatory system than Accra to inform urban policy. We established 10 ‘fixed’ (yearlong) and 120 ‘rotating’ (weeklong) monitoring sites to capture both the temporal and spatial patterns in Kigali’s sound environment. The measurement occurred between November 2022 and December 2023, and samples were collected at 1 min interval, resulting in 5155 014 (3580 site-days) and 1190 620 (827 site-days) site-minutes of valid data from the fixed and rotating sites, respectively. The 130 monitoring sites covered a variety of geographic and land-use factors across diverse neighborhoods and sources. We computed several noise metrics, including 1 h (LAeq1 h), daily (LAeq24 h), day-time (Lday), and night-time (Lnight). Daily noise (LAeq24 h) levels across the city ranged between 38 dBA and 85 dBA. Commercial, business, and industrial (CBI) and high-density residential (HD) communities experienced the highest noise levels, with some sites constantly above 70 dBA at day and 65 dBA at night. About 63% of our observed day-time values (up to ∼72% in some areas) exceeded the Rwandan day-time standard (55 dBA) for residential areas, whereas 69% of the observed night-time values (up to 80% in some areas) exceeded the corresponding night-time standard (45 dBA). In Nyarugenge, the most urbanized district, as much as 75% of our site-days data exceeded day-time standard. However diurnal patterns throughout the city were similar, rising from ∼5 am, peaking at about 8 am and plateauing until 6 pm before falling to their lowest at midnight. Overall, noise levels in the city did not vary much by day of the week, weekdays vs weekend, or dry vs wet seasons. Environmental noise in Kigali often exceeded both Rwandan standards and international guidelines, with residents in the city center district, CBI and HD areas at risk of higher exposure, and hence higher risk of adverse effects. Detailed assessment of the sources, at-risk population, and associated health effects may inform Rwandan’s environmental policy efforts and city initiatives in the face of the ongoing urban growth and densification."

Mayes,Measurement report: Extreme heat and wildfire emissions enhance volatile organic compounds  in a temperate forest,"Critical volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were monitored in a temperate deciduous forest in the Midwestern US using Proton Transfer Reaction Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer. The forests contained diverse biogenic sources and were influenced by short- and long-range transport of anthropogenic emissions. Extreme heat and wildfire events increased VOC concentrations during the study, offering crucial insights into emission dynamics and their potential impacts on future climate scenarios. 
 Climate extremes are projected to cause unprecedented deviations in the emission and transformation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which trigger feedback mechanisms that will impact the atmospheric oxidation and formation of aerosols and clouds. However, the response of VOCs to future conditions such as extreme heat and wildfire events is still uncertain. This study explored the modification of the mixing ratio and distribution of several anthropogenic and biogenic VOCs in a temperate oak–hickory–juniper forest as a response to increased temperature and transported biomass burning plumes. A chemical ionization mass spectrometer was deployed on a tower at a height of 32 m in rural central Missouri, United States, for the continuous and in situ measurement of VOCs from June to August of 2023. The maximum observed temperature in the region was 38 °C, and during multiple episodes the temperature remained above 32 °C for several hours. Biogenic VOCs such as isoprene and monoterpene followed closely the temperature daily profile but at varying rates, whereas anthropogenic VOCs were insensitive to elevated temperature.  During the measurement period, wildfire emissions were transported to the site and substantially increased the mixing ratios of acetonitrile and benzene, which are produced from burning of biomass. An in-depth analysis of the mass spectra revealed more than 250 minor compounds, such as formamide and methylglyoxal. Extreme heat and presence of wildfire plumes modified the overall volatility, reactivity, O : C, and H : C ratios of the extended list of VOCs. The calculated OH reactivities during extreme temperature condition and transport of biomass burning plumes were 106.37±4.27 and 106.22±5.15 s−1, respectively, which are substantially higher than background level of 98.78±1.16 s−1. Multivariate analysis also clustered the compounds into five factors, which highlighted the sources of the unaccounted-for VOCs. Ultimately, results here underscore the effect of extreme heat and wildfire emissions on the overall chemical properties VOC in a temperate forest."

Swiler;Benjamin M. Wagman;Kate Marvel,Mount Pinatubo's effect on the moisture-based drivers of plant productivity,"Analysis of post-eruption climate conditions using the impact metrics is crucial for understanding the hydroclimatic responses. We used NASA’s Earth system model to perform the experiments and utilized the moisture-based impact metrics and hydrological variables to investigate the effect of volcanically induced conditions that govern plant productivity. This study highlights Mt. Pinatubo's impact on the drivers of plant productivity and regional and seasonal dependence of these drivers. 
 Large volcanic eruptions can significantly influence the climate system by altering the stratospheric sulfate concentrations, atmospheric radiative balance, stratospheric and surface temperature, and regional hydroclimate. A comprehensive understanding of the volcanically-driven regional hydroclimate response is essential for assessing the socio-economic implications of such short-term episodic climate perturbations, which can lead to droughts, with potential significant impacts to vulnerable civilizations that depend on flooding as a natural crops irrigation mechanism. However, the regional rainfall response to volcanic forcings is substantially dominated by the natural variability in the rainfall response, and which creates a gap in our understanding of how eruptions affect ecohydrological conditions and plant productivity. Here, we explore the understudied store (soil moisture) and flux (evapotranspiration) of water as the short-term ecohydrological control over plant productivity in response to the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. We used the NASA's Earth system model for modeling of the Mt. Pinatubo eruption and detect the ensuing hydroclimate responses. The model simulates a mean surface cooling of ∼ 0.5 °C following the Mt. Pinatubo eruption. The rainfall response is spatially heterogeneous with large temporal variability, yet still shows suppressed rainfall in the northern hemisphere after the eruption. We find that up to 10 %–15 % of land regions show a statistically significant hydroclimate response (wet and dry) as calculated by the Soil Moisture Deficit Index (SMDI) and Evapotranspiration Deficit Index (ETDI).

We evaluate the Australian climate model using aerosol observations and find it underestimates aerosol number often by over 50%. Model changes were tested to improve aerosol concentrations, but some of our changes had severe negative effects on the larger climate system, highlighting issues in aerosol-cloud interaction modelling. 
 The interaction of natural marine aerosol with clouds and radiation is a significant source of climate model uncertainty. The Southern Ocean represents a key area to understand these interactions, and a region where significant model biases exist. Here we provide an evaluation of the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator atmosphere model which includes a double-moment aerosol scheme. We evaluate against measurements of condensation nuclei (N10) and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) number from seven ship campaigns and three terrestrial locations, spanning the years 2015–2019. We find that N10 is heavily underestimated in the model across all regions and seasons by more than 50 % and in some cases by over 80 % at higher latitudes. CCN is also strongly underestimated over marine and Antarctic regions, often by more than 50 %. We then perform seven sensitivity tests to explore different aerosol configurations. We find that updating the dimethyl sulfide climatology and turning on the primary marine organic aerosol flux marginally improves marine CCN by between 4 %–9 %. N10 was reduced by between 3 %–9 %. The Southern Ocean radiative bias is also reduced by this combination of changes, with limited adverse effects. We also test altering the sea spray flux to use wind gust instead of mean wind speed. This significantly improved CCN in the marine regions, but resulted in detrimental impacts on the region's radiation budget, indicating that drastically improving the Southern Ocean's CCN budget may lead to poorer simulations of the global climate."

Using in situ airborne measurements around Ascension Island, this work provides critical parameterizations of aerosol–cloud interactions to improve the assessment of radiative forcing in the SEA region. It also identifies key entrainment regions for understanding the vertical transport process of African BBAs. 
 African biomass burning (BB) aerosols transported over the southeast Atlantic (SEA) strongly influence cloud properties but remain a major source of uncertainty in regional climate assessment. This study characterizes vertical profiles of thermodynamic conditions, aerosol properties, and cloud microphysics around Ascension Island during an aircraft campaign (August–September 2017). Backward-dispersion simulations evidence that observed pollution originated from long-range transported African BB plumes. In BB-polluted marine boundary layers (MBL), aerosol number concentrations (Na) were substantially elevated relative to the clean MBL, driving increased cloud droplet number concentrations (Nd) and reduced cloud effective radii (Re). Cloud-layer mean Nd correlated strongly with aerosols below the cloud (sub-Na) but weakly with free-tropospheric (FT) aerosols. Enhanced sub-Na was due to BB aerosols entrained from the FT into the MBL along long-range transport and/or locally. Droplet activation fractions were similar in clean and moderately BB-polluted (sub-Na < 700 cm−3) clouds, while a weaker Nd–Na correlation was observed in more polluted clouds. Region-specific Nd–Na parameterizations are necessary for representing BB aerosol-cloud interactions over the remote SEA. A robust inverse Nd–Re relationship was observed, regardless of BB influence. By coupling backward simulations with satellite retrievals, this study indicates that FT-to-MBL entrainment of African BB aerosols over the SEA occurs several days before arrival at Ascension Island, predominantly west of 0° E for examined cases. These findings provide unique observational constraints for representing aerosol-cloud interactions and vertical transport of African BB aerosols in climate models, offering improved assessments of African BB impacts over the SEA."

The findings underline the strengths and limitations of different observational and modeling approaches, and emphasizes on the importance of considering aerosol conditions and local meteorology when interpreting boundary layer dynamics. 
 We investigate the dynamics of the atmospheric Boundary Layer (BL) over the Atlantic Ocean, with a focus on the region surrounding Cabo Verde during the Joint Aeolus Tropical Atlantic Campaign (JATAC) and the ASKOS experiment, using a combination of ground-based PollyXT and Doppler lidars, satellite lidar data from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO), radiosondes, and the model outputs of the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The comparison of CALIPSO lidar results with ECMWF/IFS reanalysis for 2012–2022, revealed good agreement for BL top over open ocean regions but weaker relation over dust-affected areas of the African continent. In these regions, daytime CALIPSO retrievals typically indicate lower BL tops than ECMWF, while at night CALIPSO often detects aerosols within the residual layer, leading to higher estimates than the model. Observations in Cabo Verde highlight distinctive Marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer (MABL) characteristics, such as limited diurnal evolution, but also show the potential for BL heights to reach up to 1 km, driven by factors like strong winds that increase mechanical turbulence. Additionally, the technical and physical challenges in estimating the BL height using different datasets and methods are discussed, examining cases with different thermodynamical conditions and aerosol load that directly affect the dynamics of the BL. The findings underline the strengths and limitations of different observational and modeling approaches, and emphasizes on the importance of considering local meteorology and aerosol conditions when interpreting BL height."

Baek;Wei-Ting Hung;Zachary Moon;Youhua Tang;Barry Baker;Rick Saylor;Jung-Hun Woo;Daniel Tong,Quantifying forest canopy shading and turbulence effects on boundary layer ozone over the United States,"Forests influence air quality by altering ozone levels, but most air pollution models overlook canopy effects. Our study improves ozone predictions by incorporating forest canopy shading and turbulence into a widely used model. We found that tree cover reduces near-surface ozone by decreasing photolysis rates and diffusion inside canopy, resulting in lower ozone concentrations in densely forested areas. These findings enhance ozone surface prediction accuracy and improve air quality modeling. 
 The presence of dense forest canopies significantly alters the near-field dynamical, physical, and chemical environment, with implications for atmospheric composition and air quality variables such as boundary layer ozone (O3). Observations show profound vertical gradients in O3 concentration beneath forest canopies; however, most chemical transport models (CTMs) used in the operational and research community, such as the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, cannot account for such effects due to inadequate canopy representation and lack of sub-canopy processes. To address this knowledge gap, we implemented detailed forest canopy processes – including in-canopy photolysis attenuation and turbulence – into the CMAQv5.3.1 model, driven by the Global Forecast System and enhanced with high-resolution vegetation datasets. Simulations were conducted for August 2019 over the contiguous US. The canopy-aware model shows substantial improvement, with mean O3 bias reduced from +0.70 ppb (Base) to −0.10 ppb (Canopy), and fractional bias from +9.71 % to +6.37 %. Monthly mean O3 in the lowest model layer (∼ 0–40 m) decreased by up to 9 ppb in dense forests, especially in the East. Process analysis reveals a 75.2 % drop in first-layer O3 chemical production, with daily surface production declining from 673 to 167 ppb d−1, driven by suppressed photolysis and vertical mixing. This enhances NOx titration and reduces O3 formation under darker, stable conditions. The results highlight the critical role of canopy processes in atmospheric chemistry and demonstrate the importance of incorporating realistic vegetation-atmosphere interactions in CTMs to improve air quality forecasts and health-relevant exposure assessments."

We found that ice particle changes depend strongly on temperature, humidity conditions, and turbulence. We also found that turbulence and the presence of supercooled liquid water often occur together, and when they do, ice particle growth is especially strong. These findings help scientists to improve weather models. 
 Ice microphysical processes are inherently complex because of their sensitivity to temperature and humidity, the diversity of ice crystal habits, and their interaction with supercooled liquid water (SCL) and turbulence. Long-term surface-based radar observations have been systematically used to unravel the different processes that affect ice particle growth. In this study, we present a statistical analysis of 6.5 years of Ka-band radar observations in Arctic cloud systems, combined with thermodynamic profiles derived from radiosonde measurements. For the first time, ice particle growth and sublimation – diagnosed from vertical gradients of radar reflectivity and mean Doppler velocity – are systematically mapped across a broad range of temperature and moisture conditions. These vertical gradients correspond closely to saturation levels relative to ice and exhibit a strong temperature dependence in supersaturated regions. Notably, distinct signatures near −15 °C are indicative of dendritic growth. Turbulence, quantified via the eddy dissipation rate (EDR), is most frequently observed in regions containing SCL. The co-occurrence of SCL and elevated turbulence results in significantly enhanced ice particle growth compared to conditions in which either is present alone.This work provides new observational constraints that are critical for improving the representation of ice microphysics in atmospheric models."

The results indicate the differences in cirrus occurrence and optical properties across latitudes. Besides seasonality, the cirrus extinction and depolarization show a consistent decrease with increasing latitude. The potential causes are discussed and it turns out that aerosol particles show much larger concentrations at midlatitudes than at high-latitudes. 
 Cirrus clouds play a crucial role in the Earth's radiation budget. However, direct observations and model simulations of cirrus at high-latitudes are still sparse. In this study, we present the occurrence rate (OR) and geometrical thickness as well as extinction and particle linear depolarization ratio (PLDR) of cirrus at midlatitudes (35–60° N; 30° W–30° E) and high-latitudes (60–80° N; 30° W–30° E) at temperatures below −38 °C using lidar measurements of CALIPSO in the years 2014 and 2018–2021. The results indicate a distinct seasonal cycle in the cirrus occurrence and optical properties. The seasonality in ORs and geometrical thicknesses generally becomes more pronounced with increasing latitude, while the altitude ranges of cirrus decrease with increasing latitude. The extinction coefficients decrease with increasing altitude at both high- and midlatitudes and are, in addition, larger at midlatitudes than at high-latitudes in all seasons. The calculated cirrus optical depths also show larger values at midlatitudes than at high-latitudes, while the differences across latitudes in winter are negligible. The distributions of PLDR in each 5° latitude bin show a general decrease with increasing latitude, leading to a remarkable latitudinal difference with larger values at midlatitudes than at high-latitudes. This indicates larger and more irregular ice crystals forming at midlatitudes than at high-latitudes. Finally, we compare the aerosol concentrations at different latitudes acting as ice-nucleating particles (INPs) to trigger heterogeneous freezing, as reported in previous studies. It turns out that aerosols such as mineral dust and soot (including aviation-induced soot) indicate much larger concentrations at midlatitudes than at high-latitudes."

Via ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry of tropospheric and stratospheric filter samples, we identified various organic compounds. Our findings underscore the significant cross-tropopause transport of biogenic secondary organic aerosol and anthropogenic pollutants. 
 Increasing anthropogenic emissions have led to numerous organic compounds in the atmosphere, with uncertain effects on climate, ecosystems, and human health. Particularly, the composition and impact of organic aerosol in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) remain poorly understood, with few studies addressing the general distribution of aerosols in this layer. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of a tropopause fold and convective systems during an airborne campaign over central Europe in summer 2024. We collected filter samples with a multichannel sampler for organic aerosol, effectively separating tropospheric and stratospheric air masses. As a result, we analyzed the chemical composition on a molecular level using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry. A subsequent non-target analysis provides novel insights into compositional differences throughout the UTLS. Our findings reveal numerous anthropogenic organic compounds, including C8H19O5PS2 and C15H15NO3S2, alongside dicarboxylic acids, organosulfates, and oxidation products of volatile organic compounds found in stratospheric samples. Additional target analysis identifies pollutants like perfluorooctanoic acid and tris(2-chloropropyl) phosphate that redistribute from the ground. These findings underscore the importance of transport processes to high altitudes and the growing impact of anthropogenic pollution, contributing to a better understanding of the relationship between emissions, the chemical composition of the UTLS, and climate effects."

These trends correlate with rising soil temperature and moisture during the late summer and snow depth of the preceding spring. Peaks in 2012 and 2019 emission link to wildfires activity. Findings suggest wetlands as key CH4 sources and underscore the need for ongoing high-resolution monitoring in this region. 
 Siberia's vast wetlands, permafrost, and boreal forests are significant, but their sources of methane (CH4) are poorly quantified. Using vertical CH4 profiles and meteorological data from the ZOtino Tall Tower Observatory (ZOTTO; 60°48′ N, 89°21′ E) in Central Siberia, we analyse long-term trends in CH4 growth rates, seasonal patterns, and diurnal cycles from 2010 to 2021. Our results show a persistent long-term trend in CH4 mole fractions and an insignificant increasing seasonal cycle amplitude, (2.12 ppb yr−1, p=0.12) along with a pronounced late-summer CH4 peak. Diurnal analysis reveals a growing late summer (July–October) CH4 amplitude over the analysed decade (5.29 ppb yr−1, p=0.001), driven by rising nighttime fluxes correlated with late summer soil temperature (R2=0.65, p<0.01), soil moisture (R2=0.36, p=0.032) and with preceding spring snow depth (R2=0.54, p=0.03). Notably high nighttime CH4 fluxes occurred in 2012 and 2019 mainly due to wildfires. These findings suggest that increasing late-summer CH4 emissions, primarily from wetlands to the west and southwest of ZOTTO, dominantly contribute to the overall CH4 rise. Our study underscores the importance of continuous, high-frequency greenhouse gas observations for accurately quantifying regional CH4 trends."

 The Radio Occultation Modeling EXperiment (ROMEX) is an international collaboration to test the impact of varying numbers of radio occultation (RO) profiles in operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. An average of 35 000 RO profiles d−1 for September–November 2022 from 13 different missions are being used in experiments at major NWP centers. This paper evaluates properties of ROMEX data, with emphasis on the three largest datasets: COSMIC-2 (Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate-2 or C2), Spire, and Yunyao.The penetration depths (percent of profiles reaching different levels above the surface) of most of the ROMEX datasets are similar, with more than 80 % of all occultations reaching 2 km or lower and more than 50 % reaching 1 km or lower.The relative uncertainties of the C2, Spire, and Yunyao bending angles and refractivities are estimated using the three-cornered hat method. They are similar on the average in the region of overlap (45–45° N). Larger uncertainties occur in the tropics compared to higher latitudes below 20 km. Relatively small variations in longitude exist.We investigate biases in the observations by comparing them to each other and to models. C2 bending angles appear to be biased by about 0.15 % compared to Spire and other ROMEX data between 10 and 30 km altitude. These biases, most of which are representativeness or sampling differences, are caused by the different orbits of C2 and other ROMEX missions around the non-spherical Earth and the associated varying radii of curvature."

We simulated lower atmospheric scattering during two mid-latitude auroral events and confirmed that scattering can lead to line-of-sight speed biases, thereby increasing the horizontal differences between opposite cardinal directions. This scattering impact needs to be carefully considered in thermospheric dynamics analysis. 
 Scattered airglow emissions in the lower atmosphere can bias ground-based interferometer observations of thermospheric winds, particularly when airglow brightness becomes spatially uneven due to auroras. During two geomagnetic storms with visible auroras on 10 May and 10 October 2024, the Doppler Asymmetric Spatial Heterodyne (DASH) and Fabry-Perot (FP) interferometers concurrently detected atypical winds at Siziwang (SIZW, 41.83° N, 111.93° E), suspected to be caused by scattering. These atypical winds, characterized by horizontal differences exceeding 400 m s−1 between opposite cardinal directions (N-S or E-W) and downwelling exceeding 100 m s−1, showed a strong temporal association with airglow brightness. By modelling the transmission of scattered airglow emissions, we calculate post-scattering wind speeds as the initial wind speeds weighted by both scattered and direct intensities. With fixed initial winds (100 m s−1 westward, 400 m s−1 southward, zero vertical wind), the simulation reproduces horizontal differences of approximately 400 m s−1 on 10 May and 100 m s−1 on 10 October, both capturing the temporal characteristics of the atypical winds. The simulation shows that scattering-induced biases on line-of-sight speed take their sign from the brighter region, while their magnitude varies directionally with the angle to that region: at 45° elevation, biases 135–180° azimuth away exceed those in the brighter region by more than 10 times. Limited by uncertainties in airglow images and optical depth of model inputs, the simulation incurs numerical errors of roughly 75 % during some periods. Effective correction of the scattering impact will require improved accuracy of model inputs in the future."

The IMR shows large improvements compared to previous designs in reducing non-real signal in the instrument, reducing uncertainties for trace gas studies in the laboratory and the field. We characterize this new IMR and demonstrate its use in analyzing air masses of unknown composition during a field campaign, reporting concentrations of important gases. 
 We introduce a custom-built, field-deployable, atmospheric pressure Ion-Molecule reaction Region (IMR) for use with Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry (CIMS), the so-called “t-IMR”. The design is described in quantitative detail and shows significant mitigation in potential measurement interference compared to other IMR configurations, particularly those operating at low pressure. The relatively large laminar flow and inner chamber diameter reduce the probability of sampled air and ion clusters interacting with the Teflon surfaces of the IMR before being detected by Time-of-Flight (ToF) mass spectrometry. This also leads to a substantial reduction in wall effects and artificial background signals for even low volatility organic products, as demonstrated in alpha-pinene ozonolysis experiments. An electric field is induced perpendicular to flow in the t-IMR to accelerate ions and consequent charged sample clusters to the MS interface. The strength of this field is modulated and optimized to simultaneously maximize total ion flux and instrument sensitivity. A sheath flow apparatus is introduced to provide small N2 flows counter to ion and sample cluster flow into the MS to reduce the likelihood of particulate buildup and clogs to the pinhole separating the IMR from the MS, ensuring uninterrupted sampling for extended periods of time. Finally, we demonstrate the capability of the t-IMR to be deployed to the field to measure down to sub-ppt level ambient concentrations of important trace gases including reactive bromine at a ground-based site in the marine boundary layer. We find that the t-IMR design considerably reduces artificial signals from surface contact and wall effects, and improves detection of very low concentration species in the ambient atmosphere, with respective limits of detection of 0.06, 0.05, and 2 ppt for Br2, HOBr, and HNO3. The relationship between instrument sensitivity and IMR water vapor concentrations is also explored and applied to in-field measurements."

Here, we combine UAV (Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle) measurements of CO2 gas concentrations with a Large-Eddy simulation model in a sub-mesoscale inversion to separate fluxes by landcover type, demonstrating a promising approach to capture and upscale flux heterogeneity within eddy-covariance footprints. 
 Many natural ecosystems are composed of heterogeneous patches differentiated by wetness levels and vegetation composition, resulting in fine-scale flux patterns across the different landcovers that can be challenging to quantify. Here, we present a case study at Stordalen Mire in subarctic Sweden, where we conducted Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) measurements of CO2 mole fractions and combine them with a large-eddy simulation (LES) model through a site-level inversion method to differentiate the flux rate signatures from different patch types. We use the LES model EULAG (EUlerian LAGrangian) to simulate high-resolution flow patterns and benchmark the spatial variability of modelled concentrations with data from UAV-based grid surveys of CO2 mixing ratio. Coupling the inversion results with eddy-covariance (EC) flux measurements for the time of the UAV flight allows quantifying net CO2 fluxes for the individual landcover types. Model evaluation showed an R2 up to 0.70, with model uncertainties mostly related to the transport model uncertainty and the UAV sampling footprint that does not evenly sample landcover types. The inversion fluxes were subsequently compared to patch-level chamber measurements of carbon dioxide from palsa, bog, and fen, and showed a good agreement in flux patterns across those patch types dominating the UAV-sampled footprint. Different landcover classification schemes were considered, and results showed a consistent improvement in the model performance when further representing the ecological and hydrological heterogeneities. Our novel technique shows promising results in estimating landcover-type flux heterogeneity within eddy-covariance tower footprints, thus providing a basis for upscaling of EC fluxes to a larger domain."

Young;Feng Zhao,"HIStory of LAND transformation by humans in South  America (HISLAND-SA): annual and 1 km gridded  data for soybean, maize, wheat, and rice (1950–2020)","This study reconstructed the spatial and temporal patterns of four major crops (soybean, maize, wheat, and rice) in South America from 1950 to 2020 by integrating multiple data sources. The results reveal a significant expansion in cropland, particularly for soybean, leading to a substantial reduction in natural vegetation such as forests and grasslands. The datasets can be used to assess the impacts of cropland expansion on water, carbon, and nitrogen cycles in South America. 
 South America is a global hotspot for land use and land cover (LULC) change, marked by dramatic agricultural land expansion and deforestation. While previous studies have documented land use and land cover changes in South America over recent decades, there is still a lack of spatially explicit and time-series maps of crop types that capture shifts in crop distribution. Therefore, developing high-resolution, long-term, and crop-specific datasets is crucial for advancing our understanding of human–environment interactions and for assessing the impacts of agricultural activities on carbon and biogeochemical cycles, biodiversity, and climate. In this study, we integrated multi-source data, including high-resolution remote sensing data, model-based data, and historical agricultural census data, to reconstruct the historical dynamics of four major commodity crops (i.e., soybean, maize, wheat, and rice) in South America at an annual timescale and 1 km × 1 km spatial resolution from 1950 to 2020. The results showed that soybean and maize cultivation expanded rapidly in South America by encroaching on other vegetation (i.e., forest, pasture/rangeland, and unmanaged grass/shrubland) over the past 70 years, whereas wheat and rice areas remained relatively stable. Specifically, soybean is one of the most dramatically expanded crops, increasing from essentially zero in 1950 to 48.8 Mha in 2020, resulting in a total loss of 23.92 Mha of other vegetation. In addition, the area of maize increased by a factor of 2.1 from 12.7 Mha in 1950 to 26.9 Mha in 2020. The newly developed crop type dataset provides important insights for assessing the impacts of cropland expansion on crop production, biodiversity, greenhouse gas emissions, and carbon and nitrogen cycles in South America. Moreover, these data are instrumental for developing national policies, sustainable trade, investment, and development strategies aimed at securing food supply and other human and environmental objectives in South America.

This is often lacking in current disaster databases. Our dataset fills this gap by integrating impact records with information on disaster locations, high-resolution meteorological data, and population estimates. Covering 382 disasters in 71 countries (1979–2018), this dataset enables deeper analyses of heat-related risk and vulnerabilities. 
 International databases of disaster impacts are crucial for advancing disaster risk research, particularly as climate change intensifies the frequency and intensity of many natural hazards – including temperature extremes. However, many widely-used disaster impact databases lack information on the physical dimension of the hazards associated with an impact, and on the exposure to such hazards. This hinders analysing drivers of severe disaster outcomes. To bridge this knowledge gap, we present SHEDIS-Temperature, a dataset that provides Subnational Hazard and Exposure information for temperature-related DISaster impact records (https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/WNOTTC; Lindersson and Messori, 2025). This open-access dataset links temperature-related impact records from the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) with subnational data on their locations, associated meteorological time series, and population maps. SHEDIS-Temperature provides hazard and exposure data for 2835 subnational locations associated with 382 disaster records from 1979–2018 in 71 countries. Detailed hazard metrics, derived from 0.1° 3 hourly data, encompass absolute indicators, such as the heat stress measure apparent temperature accounting for humidity and wind speed, as well as percentile-based indicators of when and where temperatures exceeded local thresholds. Population exposure data include annual population figures for impacted subnational administrative units and person-days of exposure to threshold-exceeding temperatures. Outputs are available at grid-point level as well as zonally aggregated to administrative subdivision units, and disaster-record levels. Technical validation against a station-based dataset indicated minor systematic biases – slightly overestimated minimum and underestimated maximum temperatures – but confirmed high consistency between datasets, with correlation coefficients ≥0.9 and mean absolute errors ≤2 °C. By providing comprehensive attributes across the hazard-exposure spectrum, SHEDIS-Temperature supports interdisciplinary research on past temperature-related disasters, offering valuable insights for future risk mitigation and resilience strategies."

The data has a spatial resolution of one kilometer, which means it provides highly localized precipitation information. To estimate precipitation for a specific day in the past, we searched for days in the recent radar data period with similar weather patterns, known as the analog method. The median of the produced dataset is available for public use and can be found on Zenodo. 
 High-resolution gridded precipitation data is scarce, especially at time intervals shorter than daily. However hydrological applications for example benefit from a finer temporal resolution of rainfall information. In this context, we introduce an hourly precipitation dataset for Belgium, featuring a resolution of 1 km. An hourly high-resolution gridded precipitation product over Belgium can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of both short-term and long-term rainfall events, which can be used for wide-ranging applications such as flash flood forecasting and warning systems, studying precipitation extremes and trends, validating weather and climate models or detecting changes in precipitation patterns due to climate change. Similar products such as EURADCLIM (Europe) (Overeem et al., 2023) and RADKLIM (Germany) (Winterrath et al., 2018), both radar-based gauge-adjusted datasets, have already been created and published. Both datasets are high spatial resolution dataset (2 and 1 km, respectively).A high resolution precipitation grid of hourly precipitation data for Belgium covering the period from 1940 to 2016 using the analog technique, is created. The analogs are sampled from the period 2017–2022 for which high resolution radar data precipitation fields are available. The initial step involves identifying the criteria, i.e. atmospheric parameters such as atmospheric pressure, temperature and humidity, that can be used to determine analogous days. These atmospheric parameters are obtained from the ERA5 observational data provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF).  In a second step, hourly precipitation data for suitable analog days are extracted from our radar database, and then used to create the high resolution grid of hourly precipitation for Belgium from 1940 to 2016. Data from rain gauges on the Belgian terrain were used for validation of the candidate precipitation analogs.The dataset for this project lists the top 25 analog days for 1940–2016 based on similarities in weather patterns. The analogs are ranked based on how closely they match to their target day.The database is relying on the Zarr archiving format and is composed of two archives. A first archive contains all target days together with the 25 best analogs. The second one provides a precipitation field for each hour of every day in the past. The Zarr format of the database allows slicing through the database. For example, it allows one to easily delimit a specific area of interest and a specific time frame for which the high resolution gridded median hourly precipitation fields are needed. The median field dataset is available on Zenodo   (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14965710) (Debrie et al., 2025)."

We discovered that the long-term rules of disturbance known as ""regime"" leave a unique footprint in a forest's spatial biomass patterns. We trained a model on millions of computer simulations to learn this link. By applying this model to detailed satellite biomass, we could read these patterns to infer the disturbance regime globally, helping make climate projections more accurate. 
 Forests play a central role in the global carbon cycle by serving as critical carbon sinks for atmospheric CO2. Yet, the stability and continued capacity of these sinks are increasingly threatened by a growing number of disturbances. Accurately representing the stochastic nature of disturbance remains a major challenge and a key source of uncertainty in our understanding of carbon cycle dynamics. This study presents a novel framework for deriving disturbance regimes characterized by extent (μ), frequency (α), intensity (β), as well as background mortality (Kb) directly from landscape features of high-resolution satellite biomass data. These regimes reflect the characteristics of long term disturbances at the landscape scale rather than the properties of any single event. Our analysis inverts the forward model framework developed by Wang et al. (2024), which used a machine learning model trained on a massive synthetic dataset of over 8 million forward model simulations to link known disturbance regimes to spatial biomass patterns. Instead of predicting patterns from regimes, we use observed satellite biomass patterns to infer the underlying disturbance regimes. To ensure robustness, we first identified the optimal spatial resolution for aggregating both simulation and satellite data, minimizing discrepancies in feature value ranges and reducing extrapolation risk. Using this framework, we produced the first globally consistent, observationally constrained dataset of forest disturbance regime parameters and their associated uncertainties, provided at both a 25 × 25 km2 tile level and as a gridded 0.25° global product. Additionally, we used a Dissimilarity Index (DIK) to quantify prediction uncertainty and identify potential extrapolation by measuring observations' divergence from the training set. An empirical evaluation of borderline disturbance regimes supports the assumptions and methodological approach used to build the dataset. Our global maps of disturbance regimes provide a novel, process-based tool for investigating the coupled dynamics of disturbance, vegetation, and the carbon cycle, with potential applications for improving the representation of stochastic disturbances in large-scale ecosystem models."

This comprehensive dataset consists of phosphorus fertilizer/manure application to cropland, manure application/deposition to pasture, manure deposition to rangeland, and atmospheric phosphorus deposition. It supports analyses of nutrient budgets and provides essential forcing data for Earth system models. 
 Nitrogen and Phosphorus (P) are essential nutrients for sustaining life on Earth and have been increasingly applied in global agriculture to meet the growing demand for food production. Quantifying the spatial and temporal dynamics of nutrient inputs to the terrestrial biosphere is crucial for analyzing nutrient flows in crop-livestock systems, managing nutrient resources sustainably, and mitigating nutrient-related environmental impacts. Here, built upon our previous work mapping global nitrogen inputs (History of anthropogenic Nitrogen inputs, HaNi), this study presents the History of anthropogenic P inputs (HaPi) dataset, a comprehensive quantification of human-driven P fluxes to terrestrial ecosystems. HaPi covers the period from 1860 to 2020 and has a spatial resolution of 5 arc-minutes (about 10 km at the equator) with an annual time-step. This harmonized dataset integrates seven components, including P fertilizer application on croplands and pastures, manure P application on croplands and pastures, manure P deposition on pastures and rangelands, and atmospheric P deposition. The results reveal that the global total P input increased from 3.8 Tg yr–1 in the 1860s to 40.9 Tg yr–1 in the 2010s, with mineral fertilizer and livestock manure contributing equally to the increase. Regional patterns have shifted significantly over the study period, with China, South Asia, and Brazil surpassing Europe and the USA as the regions with the highest P inputs in recent decades. Furthermore, mineral fertilizers dominate P inputs in most industrialized countries in the Northern Hemisphere, whereas manure P remains the primary source in many countries of the Southern Hemisphere. The HaPi dataset improves P mass budget calculations and provides essential forcing data for empirical or mechanistic models, supporting critical research in agricultural nutrient management, water quality control, and assessments of the coupled human-Earth system.

 The DANish regional atmospheric ReAnalysis (DANRA) is a novel high-resolution (2.5 km) reanalysis dataset covering Denmark and its surrounding regions over a 34-year period (1990–2023). Denmark’s complex coastline, with over 400 islands and an extensive 7,400 km coastline, means that most municipalities experience mixed land-sea variability. This complexity requires a regional climate reanalysis that can resolve fine-scale coastal and inland features, as well as their impact on climate variability. DANRA is based on the HARMONIE-AROME Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model and assimilates a comprehensive set of observations, with a particular focus on Denmark. Compared to global reanalyses such as the ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5), DANRA demonstrates superior performance in representing essential climate variables, including near-surface weather parameters during both extreme and ordinary conditions. We illustrate these improvements in the representation of several extreme weather cases over Denmark, such as the December 1999 hurricane-force storm, the July 2022 national temperature record, and the August 2007 cloudburst in South Jutland.

This manuscript supports the comparison of different methods to find precipitation sources. 
 WaterSip is a diagnostic software tool that identifies the evaporation sources and transport pathways of precipitation or water vapour over a target area based on Lagrangian model output. In addition to the geographic location, WaterSip identifies select thermodynamic properties of the moisture sources, during atmospheric transport, and arrival over the target area based on Lagrangian particle dispersion or trajectory model output. WaterSip software thereby employs the Lagrangian diagnostic algorithm for quantitative moisture source accounting of Sodemann et al. (2008b). Moisture sources are identified from changes in specific humidity along  trajectories at each output time step. The ratio between changes in specific humidity and the specific humidity of the air parcel allow to estimate the quantitative contribution of a moisture source to an air parcel at a specific time and location. This contribution and its temporal sequence provides the basis for identifying moisture source contributions to the final precipitation. WaterSip is designed to operate on large datasets of trajectories filling regional to global domains. The results are provided as gridded information in a variety of output files in netCDF format. This paper revisits the relevant methodological foundations, describes the configuration and technical set-up, and provides a consistent example case study to illustrate the use and interpretation of the software tool and its results. A short sensitivity study supports the choice of the main parameters of the diagnostic. Key uncertainties and caveats are described and discussed throughout the text.

The model was calibrated with field data and literature, and it was extensively validated with global reference yields. The model effectively captured interannual yield variability in global and county-level yield data, demonstrating its potential for assessing the climate impacts on maize production. 
 Process-based crop models combined with land surface models are useful tools for accurately quantifying the impacts of climate change on crops while considering the interactions between agricultural land and climate. MATCRO model is a process-based crop model initially developed for paddy rice, combined with a land surface model. We developed MATCRO-Maize as a new model for maize by incorporating leaf-level photosynthesis of C4 plants and adjusting crop-specific parameters into the original MATCRO model. MATCRO-Maize was evaluated at both a point scale and a global scale through comparisons with observational values. For global-scale simulations, the simulated yield showed statistically significant differences compared with Food and Agriculture Organization's FAOSTAT data at the country and global levels. Although the absolute value of the simulated yield tended to be overestimated, MATCRO-Maize reproduced spatial patterns with a correlation coefficient (COR) of 0.58 (p value < 0.01) for the 30-year average yield comparison of the top 20 maize-producing countries. In addition, the comparisons of the interannual variability derived from detrended deviation were statistically significant for the total global yield (COR of 0.55 with p value < 0.01) and for half of the top 20 countries (COR of 0.64–0.90 with p value < 0.001 for 6 countries; COR of 0.50–0.51 with p value < 0.01 for 2 countries; COR of 0.48–0.55 with p value < 0.05 for 2 countries), which are comparable with those of other global crop models.

 Electron- or photoionization mass spectrometry coupled with product time-of-flight measurement is a universal detection scheme, which has been playing pivotal role in advancing our fundamental understanding of chemical reactions. This powerful detection scheme, however, usually does not provide the product state-specific information. Here, we propose a variant of universal detection with state-resolving capability by leveraging a three-dimensional velocity-map imaging detector with vacuum-ultraviolet photoionization probe. As demonstrated by a crossed-beam reaction of F + CH4 → CH3(vi) + HF(v), both product vibrational branching and state-resolved angular distributions are simultaneously unveiled in a (vi, v) pair-correlated manner from a single product-image measurement, which enables us to gain previously inaccessible insights. Comparisons with a six-dimensionality quantum dynamics calculation show excellent agreements, validating the approach. The proposed method is general and should open a new opportunity to gain deeper insights into many important complex chemical processes that are otherwise difficult to study.

 Efficient cargo delivery is essential for plant trait engineering, yet existing methods are often species-specific and ineffective across diverse habitats. Here, we develop core-shell microneedles for targeted delivery of biomolecular cargoes and active microorganisms into both terrestrial and aquatic plants. The microneedle architecture is rationally engineered to resist water exposure and release cargo upon contact with plant interstitial fluid, enabling controlled delivery into tissues and cells. We demonstrate that these core-shell microneedles can efficiently transport diverse cargoes, from nanoscale biomolecules such as functional nucleic acids, proteins, and plant hormones to microscale bioactive Agrobacterium, leading to strong protein expression and enhanced plant growth. Underwater delivery of salt-tolerance genes into submerged freshwater plants further demonstrates the platform’s utility for engineering stress resilience in challenging environments. By facilitating the cellular uptake of diverse cargoes into intact plants across different habitats, this amphibious microneedle strategy offers a versatile cargo delivery tool to advance plant biotechnology and environmental applications.

 X-ray imaging requires effective light transmission through scintillation screens. However, solid or solution-based scintillators suffer from photon scattering and attenuation. While prior efforts have focused on improving light extraction in solid-state scintillators through nanostructuring or optical engineering, challenges remain in mitigating internal scattering losses. Here, we report a liquid scintillator-based strategy that eliminates light scattering by exploiting in-situ coordination between lanthanide ions and ionic liquid ligands. This coordination chemistry ensures high structural homogeneity and optical transparency. Combined with self-absorption-free lanthanides, this approach achieves over 93% scintillation light transmittance, boosting X-ray imaging spatial resolution to 26 lp mm-1 within a 1 mm scintillation screen. Our scintillators exhibit long-term stability and environmental compatibility, leveraging the inherent properties of ionic liquids for sustained and biocompatible X-ray imaging. Their fluidic and shape-adaptive nature enables the development of convex and zoom scintillation lenses, facilitating uniform omni-angle X-ray detection and in-situ zoom X-ray imaging.

 The asymmetric hydrocarbonylation of olefins represents a promising and effective strategy for the synthesis of chiral carboxylic acids and their derivatives. However, achieving the synthesis of chiral cyclopropyl primary amides and cyclopropyl carboxylic acids via asymmetric hydroaminocarbonylation and hydrocarboxylation of cyclopropenes remains a significant challenge. Here, we present an efficient catalytic system that enables the utilization of cost-effective NH4OAc as a practical alternative to gaseous ammonia and simple organic amines in nickel-catalyzed asymmetric hydroaminocarbonylation of cyclopropenes under 1 atm of CO, which provides rapid access to structurally diverse primary amides, secondary amides, and tertiary amides. Notably, the Ni-catalyzed asymmetric hydrocarboxylation reaction is also established with H2O as a nucleophile to give the corresponding cyclopropyl carboxylic acids in good yields with excellent stereoselectivities. These reactions feature mild reaction conditions, exceptional levels of enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities while also exhibiting remarkable tolerance towards diverse functional groups. Moreover, our methodology proves to be highly efficient for the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds such as Levomilnacipran and Bicifadine.

Here, the authors measure interaction affinities in living cell membranes and uncover roles of Gγ prenylation and a Gβγ docking site in GIRK1 in efficient channel activation. 
 Gi/o protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) inhibit cardiac and neuronal excitability via G protein-activated K+ channels (GIRK), assembled by combinations of GIRK1 - GIRK4 subunits. GIRKs are activated by direct binding of the Gβγ dimer of inhibitory Gi/o proteins. However, key aspects of this textbook signaling pathway remain debated. Recent studies suggested no Gi/o-GIRK pre-coupling and low (>250 µM) Gβγ-GIRK interaction affinity, contradicting earlier sub-µM estimates and implying low signaling efficiency. We show that Gγ prenylation, which mediates Gβγ membrane attachment required for GIRK activation, also contributes to the Gβγ-GIRK interaction, explaining the poor affinity obtained with non-prenylated Gβγ. Using quantitative protein titration and electrophysiology in live Xenopus oocytes, Gβγ affinity for homotetrameric GIRK2 ranges from 4-30 µM. Heterotetrameric GIRK1/2 shows a higher Gβγ apparent affinity due to the Gβγ-docking site (anchor) in GIRK1, which enriches Gβγ at the channel. Biochemical approaches and molecular dynamic simulations reveal that the Gβγ anchor is formed by interacting N-terminal and distal C-terminal domains of the GIRK1 subunits, distinct from the Gβγ-binding “activation” site(s) underlying channel opening. Thus, the affinity of Gβγ-GIRK interaction is within the expected physiological range, while dynamic pre-coupling of Gβγ to GIRK1-containing channels through high-affinity interactions further enhances the GPCR-Gi/o-GIRK signaling efficiency. GIRK channels are activated by Gβγ; quantitative aspects are debatable. Here, the authors measure interaction affinities in living cell membranes and uncover roles of Gγ prenylation and a Gβγ docking site in GIRK1 in efficient channel activation."

This cognitive strategy facilitates memory-guided navigation, a finding confirmed by a neural network model that accurately reflects behavioral and monkey neural data. 
 The brain evolved to navigate a dynamic and uncertain world, but the mechanisms underlying ethologically-relevant behavioral strategies remain unclear. In the real-world, such strategies are shaped both by task demands and by the cognitive resources available to the animal. We hypothesized that eye movements constitute a vital cognitive resource to support neural computations for memory-guided navigation. We tested this using a naturalistic task in which humans use a joystick to steer and catch flashing targets in a virtual environment lacking explicit position cues. While navigating to the goal, participants physically track the latent target position with their gaze even in the absence of optic flow, demonstrating that these task-relevant eye movements reflect an embodiment of the subjects’ dynamic internal beliefs about the goal location. We developed a neural network model with tuned recurrent connectivity between oculomotor and evidence-integrating frontoparietal circuits to account for this behavioral strategy. We show that this model better explained neural data from male monkeys’ posterior parietal cortex compared to models optimized solely for task performance and unconstrained by such an oculomotor-based strategy. These results highlight the importance of eye movements in working memory computations and establish a functional significance of oculomotor signals for evidence-integration and navigation computations via embodied cognition.

Here, Luthman et al. show that for some broken ends, the two strand breaks are repaired in parallel, while for other ends one strand must be repaired before the other. 
 Nonhomologous end-joining repairs chromosomal double strand breaks, but it is unknown whether both strands are repaired by this pathway, and if one strand break’s repair path impacts the other. Here, we show that nonhomologous end-joining employs both of two a priori possible strategies. Strand breaks that can be directly ligated are joined near-simultaneously, with no effect of one strand break’s repair path on the other. More complex end structures require obligatorily ordered repair. The first strand to be repaired is used as template for repair of the opposite/second strand break, with the latter repair reaction occurring fastest when also coupled to nonhomologous end-joining. Enforced asymmetry in repair of each strand break can extend to the gap-filling polymerase employed, and whether the polymerases incorporate RNA or DNA. Our results resolve questions about pathway mechanism and identify a requirement for flexibility of the nonhomologous end-joining machinery for efficient repair of both strand breaks within diverse cellular double strand breaks. Breakage of both chromosomal DNA strands creates unique problems for DNA repair. Here, Luthman et al. show that for some broken ends, the two strand breaks are repaired in parallel, while for other ends one strand must be repaired before the other."

They highlight environmental and physiological limits on growth in the context of experimental data. 
 Rising concentrations of atmospheric CO2 (ca) increase plant photosynthesis (An) and reduce stomatal conductance (gs). This increases the intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE = An / gs), a major proxy of tree adaptation to climate change. However, whether an increase in iWUE leads to a concomitant increase in tree growth remains in dispute, prompting interest in theoretical links between iWUE and tree productivity. Here using an optimality theory for kinetics of stomatal aperture, we establish an envelope delineating maximal relative increases in tree productivity that can be inferred/expected from relative increases in iWUE. The resulting expressions are used to interpret relations between iWUE (an observable proxy) and tree growth (the target variable), using available experimental data from manipulation experiments and tree-ring isotopes. While rising ca increases iWUE, proportional increases in tree growth are unlikely given ameliorating environmental (for example, rising atmospheric dryness) and anatomical/physiological (for example, tree height) influences. The authors theoretically delineate the maximal increases in tree growth that can be expected from increases in plant intrinsic water-use efficiency, which increases with rising CO2.

Here the authors describe a process involving sustainable solvents that allows the extraction, purification, and reuse of dyes, as well as the recycling of dye-free fabrics. 
 The removal of dyes from coloured textile waste represents a sustainable approach to textile recycling, enabling the recovery of valuable chemical, and material resources that would otherwise be discarded. Up to 40% of the greenhouse gas emissions from textiles originate from dye production, making efficient recycling of dyes a major opportunity for curbing emissions and minimizing waste in both textile manufacturing and recycling. Here we demonstrate a process for the extraction, purification, and reuse of mixed dyes from polyester textiles using bio-based, non-hazardous solvents selected on the basis of computational predictions for polyester and dye solubilities. Extracted dyes are purified to individual compounds using counter-current chromatography and analysed via liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. Post-extraction characterization of the extracted dyes and polymer substrate confirms dye colour retention and polyester fabric property preservation. Dye recycling is demonstrated by redyeing colour-free fabrics with the recovered dyes. We further show a potential process configuration for dye removal using a flow-through reactor packed with a textile substrate. The proposed dye removal process produces reusable, recyclable dyes, and dye-free fabrics, thus facilitating textile recycling. The textile industry’s reliance on synthetic dyes is an important source of greenhouse gas emissions.

 Reaching carbon neutrality requires innovative and scalable carbon sequestration technologies. Here, we present an enhanced ex-situ mineral carbonation method using South China Sea seawater and calcium-rich additives for carbon dioxide storage. We conducted high-pressure (50-500 atm) laboratory experiments using calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide, and wollastonite, and performed numerical geochemical simulations. Our key finding is that calcium oxide in seawater achieves the highest carbonate yield, with geochemical models indicating that the complex ionic composition of seawater significantly enhances precipitation compared to simple brines. Additionally, an analytical Monte Carlo economic analysis projects that such efficiency could reduce sequestration costs by 15%. We conclude that seawater-based carbonation is a viable strategy for permanent carbon dioxide storage, offering a practical path for scaling carbon management in coastal regions.

 Monitoring cryptic urban wildlife is critical for managing challenges to biodiversity, infrastructure, and public health. Here we repurpose an unused dark fiber within an active telecommunication cable, transforming it into a dense network of thousands of vibration sensors to continuously track Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus) activity. Our study focused on a 20-kilometer section of the cable, collecting vibroacoustic data from an 810-meter segment within an inaccessible urban tunnel in China over 39 days in 2021. We show that rat nightlife is shaped by the weather; their bimodal nocturnal activity was suppressed by high wind speeds, cloud cover, and temperatures exceeding their thermoneutral zone.

 The extent of the differences between atmospheric and lake heatwaves remains unclear. Here we analysed daily surface water and air temperature data from 265 lakes worldwide (2000–2022) to compare heatwave trends, spatial distributions, and key differences. We find that lake heatwaves are more severe than atmospheric heatwaves, with longer accumulated heatwave days (29.7 days vs. 18.0 days), a shorter reoccurrence period (86.9 days vs. 121.4 days), and greater accumulated heat. Additionally, the frequency and total heatwave days have increased faster for lake heatwaves than for atmospheric heatwaves. When both types co-occur, heatwave severity intensifies. From a long-term perspective, reduced wind speed is the key driver of the differences between lake heatwaves and atmospheric heatwaves. Spatially, lake location is the primary determinant, followed by lake area and depth. Under a fixed-baseline high-emission scenario, by 2100, the difference is expected to diminish as air temperatures rise faster than water temperatures.

 Tropical North Atlantic sea surface temperatures and low-latitude rainfall covary, but prehistoric subtropical rainfall records are often misaligned. Here, a submarine groundwater discharge record from the northern Bahamas archives regional water balance in the northeastern Atlantic Warm Pool. We compare the reconstruction to the tropical North Atlantic seasonal temperature gradient, which can help inform how northeastern Caribbean rainy seasons are influenced by the Atlantic Warm Pool. A positive water balance in the northern Bahamas aligned with a ~0.9 °C seasonal temperature gradient from 0 to 950 CE, with both covarying on multi-decadal timescales. Aridity began at ~950 CE when a ~2.2 °C seasonal temperature gradient increase likely shortened the wet season. From 1450 to 1850 CE, frequent hurricanes offset aridity in the northeastern Caribbean by elevating rainfall. This record archives time-transgressive changes in hydroclimate forcing, and suggests that projected changes to rainfall seasonality must be considered when assessing tropical water security risk.

 Relying on lithium-ion batteries may impede the faster adoption of alternative energy storage technologies. This study defines foreign direct investment as a foreign investor’s ownership stake in a mining project and examines how it affects diversification and supply risks of critical materials for emerging energy storage. Here we propose the supply risk index and maps global production of natural graphite, manganese, sulfur, molybdenum, and vanadium across 205 regions/territories globally. Results reveal that among material production in 2020, foreign direct investment controlled 31.3% of manganese, 27% of natural graphite, 29% of molybdenum, 27.3% of vanadium, and 14% of sulfur. The proposed index treats foreign direct investment-controlled production as investors’ domestic production and reveals that increasing foreign direct investment reduces supply risks.

 The opening of the Equatorial Atlantic Gateway reshaped Earth’s ocean–atmosphere system. Rifting between South America and Africa drove a shift from continental–lacustrine to evaporitic and eventually marine environments, though the timing and duration of these transitions remain debated. Here we present a high-resolution magneto–cyclostratigraphic age model from the São Luís–Grajaú Basin (Brazilian Equatorial Margin), based on two geomagnetic reversals and Milankovitch-band cycles, yielding a 405-kyr astronomically tuned timescale. This framework enables: (i) correlation of Tethyan events with the first marine incursion in the Brazilian margin at 117.2 Ma; (ii) precise dating of the M-1r subchron at 116.93 ± 0.14 Ma and subchron “2” at 116.28 ± 0.14 Ma; and (iii) constraint of Equatorial Belt humidification onset to ~116.4 Ma, ~800 kyr after the marine incursion.

Aeolus surpasses traditional image compression methods such as Joint Photographic Experts Group 2000 (JPEG2000), which typically achieve much lower compression rates on weather data. It also enables fast data processing speeds of over 1 GigaByte (GB) per second, saving computational resources. Our tests show Aeolus maintains high accuracy, with temperature errors as low as 0.17∘ Kelvin and reliable climate patterns. These advances make it easier for researchers to access and analyze massive weather datasets, supporting better weather forecasting and climate studies.

 Flood victims are often trapped inside buildings or stranded on rooftops, making their detection a critical aspect of effective rescue operations. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as an essential tool for disaster response, particularly in locating stranded individuals during flooding events. However, existing datasets do not specifically cater to this application, limiting the effectiveness of state-of-the-art (SOTA) object detection models in such scenarios. To bridge this gap, a novel public dataset called the NITC person rescue dataset is introduced. It consists of UAV-captured images of individuals stranded within buildings and on rooftops with two types of labels: bounding boxes and image captions. This dataset presents challenging environmental conditions that significantly impact the performance of pre-trained models. In particular, these models struggle with detecting individuals behind windows, highlighting the limitations of applying general-purpose object detection models to domain-specific tasks. This performance deterioration emphasizes the need for fine-tuning to adapt these models to specialized rescue scenarios. This work systematically evaluates various fine-tuning strategies and their effectiveness in improving model performance. The advantages of model-structure-based fine-tuning are illustrated using YOLOv9 and YOLOv11 as case studies.

 This study assesses the chemical composition, oxidative potential (OP), and source contributions of traffic-related particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤10 μm (PM10) collected from two major freeways in Southern California, I-110 and I-710, and from a background site in the University of Southern California (USC) campus. On-road samples were collected in fall 2023 and spring 2024 and analyzed for organic and elemental carbon (OC and EC), trace metals, and inorganic ions. The OP of PM10 was evaluated using the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay. Freeway PM10 concentrations exceeded background levels by factors of 4–6 and were consistently higher on I-710, which has a larger proportion of heavy-duty vehicle traffic, compared to I-110. Carbonaceous components were also enriched 5 to 9 times above background, and brake and tire wear metals (e.g., Fe, Cu, Zn, Ba) exceeded the background level by more than an order of magnitude. Both PM10 concentrations and DTT activity in fall were substantially larger than the spring values, possibly due to dilution and lower carbonaceous loadings in the spring. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to identify the primary sources contributing to PM10 composition, revealing five major factors, namely tailpipe emissions, brake and tire wear, resuspended road dust, secondary inorganic aerosol, and sea salt. Multiple linear regression (MLR) linked these sources to OP, with brake and tire wear explaining 33 % of the observed DTT response while contributing only 20 % to the PM10 mass, resulting in a dimensionless OP-to-mass ratio of 1.66. These findings underscore the growing importance of non-tailpipe sources as potentially toxic yet unregulated contributors to on-road health risks, reinforcing the need for targeted research and future regulatory attention."

 Driven by the plateau-basin thermal contrasts, the Mountain-Plain Solenoid (MPS) frequently occurs over the Sichuan Basin (SCB), a deep basin immediately east of the Tibetan Plateau (TP). However, the mechanical influences of TP topography on the MPS-type circulation with modulation of synoptic circulations remains poorly understood. Here, we identify two types of MPS with distinct synoptic background of westerly and easterly winds between the TP and SCB by using K-means clustering. Specifically, the Westerly-type MPS (W-MPS), is dominated with weak high-pressure systems over the southeastern SCB. Under the lower-tropospheric westerlies away from the TP's eastern slope, lee-side downdrafts suppress the W-MPS circulation by offsetting the plateau-basin thermal forcing. The Easterly-type MPS (E-MPS), linked to weak high-pressure and post-trough systems over the basin, features prevailing easterlies flowing onto the TP's eastern slope in the lower troposphere. By blocking the easterly winds, the TP terrain effects trigger two vertical circulations respectively in the free troposphere and the lower boundary layer, which jointly intensify the MPS circulation over the SCB, building “ultrahigh” MPS with the vertical structure up to the mid-troposphere around 500 hPa. These findings reveal distinct patterns of MPS modified by the TP's topographic forcing on synoptic circulations, deepening the understanding of how the synergistic thermal and dynamic forcing of the TP terrain regulates regional atmospheric circulations."

 Over the past few decades, the Tibetan Plateau (TP) has witnessed changes in summer precipitation that follow a “south drying-north wetting” diploe pattern. Although the role of adjacent oceanic moisture export (OME) in modulating the TP precipitation has been highlighted, there is no consensus on the relationship between OME and summer TP rainfall by far. Here, we quantify the contributions of the OME from three seas, namely, the Arabian Sea (AS), the Bay of Bengal (BOB), and the South China Sea (SCS), to the TP summer precipitation and particularly examine the relationship between them from the standpoint of long-term trend based on the 35-year Lagrangian modeling and OME-based precipitation diagnostic. Climatologically, the observed and the diagnosed OME-based precipitation are compatible, both in terms of spatial pattern and magnitude. However, the preferred regions contributed by the three sea sources vary from one another. The AS with fraction contribution 62.6 % rank first with influenced regions almost covering the whole TP, followed by the BOB (21 %) and the SCS (16.4 %) with impacted regions mainly distributed over the southeastern and eastern TP, respectively. Although this order of contribution to the trends of whole TP precipitation remains unchanged, the AS comparatively acts as a main contributor to the “south drying” over the TP, while the BOB makes more contribution to the “north wetting”, implying the distinct mechanisms on the precipitation changes among the TP subsectors."
