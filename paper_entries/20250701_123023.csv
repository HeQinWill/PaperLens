The analysis of 140 vertical profiles reveals a reverse trend in LWC, maximum values at ground decreasing with height, during stable conditions in optically thin fogs, evolving towards quasi-adiabatic characteristics when fogs become thick. These results offer new perspectives for better constraining fog numerical simulations. 
 A better understanding of the fog life cycle is required to improve forecasts by numerical weather prediction models and to reduce impacts of fog on human activities. However there are still many unknowns about the physical mechanisms driving fog variability. In particular, a main issue is that the transition from optically thin to thick fog is too sudden in numerical simulations. The liquid water content (LWC) profile is a key parameter, but observations in fog are sorely lacking. Here, we investigate observations from the SOuth west FOGs 3D experiment for processes study (SOFOG3D). In situ measurements collected under a tethered balloon provide 140 vertical profiles, which allow an exhaustive analysis of 8 thin fogs (thickness <50 m) and 4 developed layers. We estimate the thin-to-thick transition period using thresholds for longwave radiation flux, turbulent kinetic energy, vertical temperature gradient, fog top height and liquid water path. In situ data are used to compute the equivalent fog adiabaticity from closure, which is compared with the value derived using a one-column conceptual model of adiabatic fog, assuming that LWC linearly increases with height. We found that the reverse trend of the LWC profile (LWC maximal at the ground and decreasing with height) is ubiquitous in optically thin fogs under stable temperature conditions, while quasi-adiabatic features with increasing LWC values with height are mainly observed in well-mixed optically thick fogs under slightly unstable conditions. This study provides new insights into the evolution of LWC profile during the fog life cycle, to constrain numerical simulations."

Two stations in the port measured pollution levels and captured over 350 ship plumes to study their chemical composition. Results showed that pollution levels, such as ultra-fine particles, were higher in the port than in the city and offer strong support to improve emission inventories. These findings may also serve as reference to assess the benefits of a sulfur Emission Control Area in the Mediterranean in 2025. 
 A summertime field campaign was conducted in Marseille, one of the major cruise and ferry ports in the Mediterranean, to provide comprehensive analysis of in-port ship emissions. High-temporal-resolution data were simultaneously collected from two monitoring stations deployed in the port area to examine the composition in both the gas and the particulate phases. More than 350 individual plumes were captured from a variety of ships and operational phases. Gaseous emissions are predominantly composed of NOx (86 %) and CO (12 %), with SO2 and CH4 each accounting for about 1 %. Although non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) make up less than 0.1 % of the gaseous phase, they can be as high as 10 % under specific operational conditions. Submicron particles (PM1) are mainly composed of organics (75 %), black carbon (21 %), and sulfate (4 %) that is not balanced with ammonium. Among the ship-related characteristics investigated, the operational phase is the most influential, with a 3-fold increase in submicron particle (PM1) emissions, along with higher relative contributions of black carbon (BC) and sulfate and the detection of vanadium, nickel, and iron during manoeuvring/navigation compared to at berth. Pollutant levels in the port are higher than those found at the urban background site, with average concentrations of NOx, PM1, and particle numbers up to twice as high in the port. Analysis of the maximum concentrations reveals that pollutants such as SO2 and trace metals, including vanadium and nickel, are 2 to 10 times higher in the port area. This study provides robust support for enhancing source apportionment and emission inventories, both of which are crucial for assessing air, health, and climate impacts of shipping."

The UAS can reach hazardous environments to sample volcanic particles and measure in situ key parameters, such as the atmospheric concentration of volcanic aerosols and gases. Acquired data bridge the gap between the existing approaches of ground sampling and remote sensing, thereby contributing to the understanding of volcanic cloud dispersion and impact. 
 Volcanic degassing and explosive eruptions inject significant amounts of gas and ash into the atmosphere, impacting the local environment and atmospheric dynamics from local to global scales. While ground- and satellite-based remote-sensing systems are key to describing explosive volcanism and assessing associated hazards, direct in situ measurements inside volcanic clouds are not possible with these methods. This study presents an innovative approach using an unoccupied aircraft system (UAS) for (i) airborne ash sampling and (ii) measurements of aerosol and gas concentrations (AeroVolc system). Commercial instruments (DJI™ Matrice 30 UAV, Alphasense™ N3 optical particle counter, and Soarability™ Sniffer4D Mini2 multigas hardware) were combined with custom-built ash collectors and particle counters to enable a more detailed analysis of volcanic clouds. Here, we showcase the deployment of our UAS on Sakurajima (Japan) and Etna (Italy), two volcanoes known for their frequent explosive eruptions and persistent degassing activity, to demonstrate how this approach enables in situ, high-resolution sample and data collection within challenging environments. Results provide grain size distributions (GSDs), information on the occurrence of particle aggregation, and solid aerosol (PM1, PM2.5, and PM10, corresponding to solid aerosol particles with a diameter of less than 1, 2.5, and 10 µm, respectively) and gas (SO2 and CO2) concentrations. Depending on whether the UAS was operated within or below ash- and/or gas-rich clouds, different insights were gained that open up new perspectives for volcanological research. These insights include the composition, concentration, generation, dispersion, and sedimentation patterns of volcanic clouds."

 The surface elevation of the Greenland Ice Sheet is constantly changing due to the interplay between surface mass balance processes and ice dynamics, each exhibiting distinct spatiotemporal patterns. Here, we employ satellite and airborne altimetry data with fine spatial (1 km) and temporal (monthly) resolutions to document this spatiotemporal evolution from January 2003 to August 2023. To estimate elevation changes of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS), we utilize radar altimetry data from CryoSat-2 and EnviSat, laser altimetry data from the ICESat and ICESat-2, and laser altimetry data from NASA's Operation IceBridge Airborne Topographic Mapper. We produce continuous monthly ice surface elevation changes from January 2003 to August 2023 on a 1 km grid covering the entire GIS. We estimate cumulative ice loss of 4352 Gt ± 315 Gt (12.1±0.9 mm sea level equivalent) during this period, excluding peripheral glaciers. Between 2003 and 2023, the ice sheet land-terminating margin underwent a significant cumulative thinning of several meters. Ocean-terminating glaciers exhibited thinning between 20–40 m, with Jakobshavn Isbræ experiencing an exceptional thinning of nearly 70 m. This dataset of fine-resolution altimetry data in both space and time will support studies of ice mass loss and will be useful for GIS modeling. To validate our monthly mass changes of the Greenland ice sheet, we use mass change from satellite gravimetry and mass change from the input–output method. On multiannual timescales, there is a strong correlation between the time series, with R values ranging from 0.88 to 0.92 (https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.s4mw6m9dh, Khan et al., 2025)"

It was produced using a reconstruction framework that combines thousands of ground observations with landform and elevation data. The dataset provides consistent weather information even in mountainous regions and supports studies on land surface and water processes, climate change, and environmental impacts. 
 Fine-resolution and high-accuracy meteorological datasets are essential for understanding climate change processes and their cascading impacts on hydrology, water resources management, and ecological systems. In this study, we present a nationwide, high-resolution dataset of six daily meteorological variables across China from 1961 to 2021, including average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, and sunshine duration. The dataset was generated through a hierarchical reconstruction framework that utilizes daily observations from 2345 meteorological stations across China, combined with station-level topographic attributes (latitude, longitude, and elevation). By decoding the nonlinear relationships among six meteorological variables and their spatial covariates, the framework enables the generation of gridded daily fields at 1 km resolution with spatial continuity and internal consistency. Validation against 118 in-situ stations confirms that the dataset achieves high accuracy across all variables, with average, maximum, and minimum temperatures exhibiting minimal errors (median RMSEs: 1.03 °C, 1.19 °C, 1.34 °C; median MEs: -0.09 °C, -0.10 °C, -0.08 °C) and high consistency with in-situ data (median CCs: 1.00, 0.99, 0.99). Atmospheric pressure shows minimal error (median RMSE: 2.48 hPa; median ME: -0.02 hPa) and high consistency (median CC: 0.98). Although relative humidity has slightly weaker accuracy (median RMSE: 6.02 %; median ME: -0.5 %; median CC: 0.90), it still surpasses standard benchmarks. Sunshine duration maintains high precision (median RMSE: 1.48 h; median ME: 0.05 h; median CC: 0.93), demonstrating overall excellent product quality. Further comparison reveals that in high-altitude and topographically complex regions, the reconstructed product demonstrates higher actual accuracy than suggested by station-to-grid validation, as spatial mismatches between stations and grid cells lead to systematic underestimation.

It was developed using large-scale wheat sample generation combined with region-specific feature selection strategies. The dataset demonstrates high accuracy (overall accuracy > 0.91) and offers detailed spatial information to support agricultural monitoring and food security efforts in China. 
 Wheat, as one of the main food crops in the world, plays a vital role in shaping agricultural trade patterns. China is the largest producer and consumer of wheat globally, characterized by extensive cultivation areas and diverse planting systems. However, current remote sensing-based wheat mapping studies often rely on uniform phenological feature variables, without adequately accounting for the significant differences in wheat growth cycles across China’s diverse agro-ecological zones. In addition, the lack of large-scale training samples severely limits both the accuracy and the spatial-temporal generalization capacity. Furthermore, existing research in China has primarily focused on the monitoring and mapping of winter wheat, while spring wheat remains largely understudied—particularly in major spring wheat-producing regions in northern China—leading to limited availability of targeted remote sensing products. These limitations hinder the development of high-accuracy, spatially comprehensive wheat mapping datasets and reduce the completeness of agricultural monitoring and food security assessments. To address these issues, this study proposes a cross-regional training sample generation method that integrates time-series remote sensing data with crop distribution products. Furthermore, a province-level, differentiated feature selection strategy is introduced to enhance the regional adaptability and classification performance of the model. Based on these methods, we developed 10 m resolution wheat distribution dataset (CN_Wheat10) covering the years 2018–2024. The dataset includes spring and winter wheat harvested area maps for 15 provinces and detailed winter wheat planted area maps for 10 provinces across China. Validation using a large-scale reference dataset built from field surveys and high-resolution imagery visual interpretation indicates that CN_Wheat10 achieves mapping accuracies above 0.93 for winter wheat and above 0.91 for spring wheat. When compared with wheat area statistics from the China Statistical Yearbook, the coefficient of determination (R2) exceeds 0.94 at the provincial level and remains above 0.88 at the municipal level. Spatially, wheat cultivation in China is characterized by a pattern of concentration in the east, dispersion in the west, a dominance of winter wheat, and a supplementary role of spring wheat. CN_Wheat10 provides spatial distribution information on both spring and winter wheat harvested areas and winter wheat planted regions in key production areas. Compared with existing products that mainly focus on winter wheat, this dataset expands both the spatial coverage and the crop types, offering more comprehensive data support for agricultural monitoring and management in China.

Natali,Estimation of above- and below-ground ecosystem parameters  for DVM-DOS-TEM v0.7.0 using MADS v1.7.3,"This study improves how we tune ecosystem models to reflect carbon and nitrogen storage in Arctic soils. By comparing model outputs with data from a black spruce forest in Alaska, we developed a clearer, more efficient method of matching observations. This is a key step towards understanding how Arctic ecosystems may respond to warming and release carbon, helping make future climate predictions more reliable. 
 The permafrost region contains a significant portion of the world's soil organic carbon, and its thawing, driven by accelerated Arctic warming, could lead to substantial release of greenhouse gases, potentially disrupting the global climate system. Accurate predictions of carbon cycling in permafrost ecosystems hinge on the robust calibration of model parameters. However, manually calibrating numerous parameters in complex process-based models is labor-intensive and is complicated further by equifinality – the presence of multiple parameter sets that can equally fit the observed data. Incorrect calibration can lead to unrealistic ecological predictions. In this study, we employed the Model Analysis and Decision Support (MADS) software package to automate and enhance the accuracy of parameter calibration for carbon dynamics within the coupled Dynamic Vegetation Model, Dynamic Organic Soil Model, and Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (DVM-DOS-TEM), a process-based ecosystem model designed for high-latitude regions. The calibration process involved adjusting rate-limiting parameters to accurately replicate observed carbon and nitrogen fluxes and stocks in both soil and vegetation. Gross primary productivity, net primary productivity, vegetation carbon, vegetation nitrogen, and soil carbon and nitrogen pools served as synthetic observations for a black spruce boreal forest ecosystem. To validate the efficiency of this new calibration method, we utilized model-generated synthetic and actual observations. When matching model outputs to observed data, we encountered difficulties in maintaining mineral soil carbon stocks. Additionally, due to strong interdependencies between parameters and target values, the model consistently overestimated carbon and nitrogen allocation to the stems of evergreen trees. This study demonstrates the calibration workflow, offers an in-depth analysis of the relationships between parameters and observations (synthetic and actual), and evaluates the accuracy of the calibrated parameter values."

It captures key processes like the formation of dust storms in the Sahara. 
 Aerosols strongly influence Earth's climate as they scatter and absorb radiation and serve as nuclei for cloud droplets and ice crystals. New Earth system models that run at kilometer resolutions allow us to examine long-standing questions related to these interactions. To perform kilometer-scale simulations with the Earth system model ICON-MPIM, we developed the one-moment aerosol module HAM-lite. HAM-lite was derived from the two-moment module HAM. Like in HAM, aerosols are represented as an ensemble of lognormal modes. Unlike in HAM, aerosol sizes and compositions are prescribed, which reduces the computational costs significantly. Here, we present a first global simulation with four aerosol modes at a resolution of 5 km over a period of 1 year. The simulation captured key aerosol processes including, for example, the emission of dust aerosols by cold pool outflows in the Sahara and the interaction of sea salt aerosols and shallow convective storms around the doldrums."

The third version of the Regional Atmosphere and Land (RAL3) science configuration for kilometre- and sub-kilometre-scale modelling represents a major advance compared to previous versions (RAL2) by delivering a common science definition for applications in tropical and mid-latitude regions. RAL3 has more realistic precipitation distributions and an improved representation of clouds and visibility. 
 The third version of the Regional Atmosphere and Land (RAL3) science configuration is documented. Developed through international partnerships, RAL configurations define settings for the Unified Model atmosphere and Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) when applied across timescales with kilometre and sub-kilometre-scale model grids. The RAL3 configuration represents a major advance compared to previous versions by delivering a common science definition suitable for application to tropical and mid-latitude regions. Developments within RAL3 include the introduction of a double-moment microphysics scheme and a bimodal cloud scheme, replacing use of a single-moment scheme and different cloud schemes for mid-latitudes and tropics in previous versions. Updates have been implemented to the boundary layer scheme and a consolidation of land model settings to be more consistent with global atmosphere and land (GAL) science configurations. Physics developments aimed to address priorities for model performance improvement identified by users. This paper documents the RAL3 science configuration, including a series of iterative revisions delivered since its first release, and their characteristics. Evidence is provided from the variety of assessments of RAL3, relative to the previous version (RAL2). Collaborative development and evaluation across organizations have enabled evaluation across a range of domains, grid spacing and timescales. The analysis indicates more realistic precipitation distributions, improved representation of clouds and of visibility, a continued trend to more realistic representation of convection, and reduced near-surface wind speeds but a persistent cold-temperature bias. Overall the convective-scale verification scores and climatological model distributions relative to observations improve for the majority of variables. Ensemble results show improvements to the spread–error relationship. User feedback from subjective assessment activities has also been positive. Differences between RAL3 revisions and RAL2 are further illustrated through a process-based analysis of a convective system over the UK. The latest RAL3 configuration (RAL3.3) is therefore recommended for research, operational numerical weather prediction, and climate production at kilometre and sub-kilometre scales."

As a representative class of MNP, polystyrene (PS) has been widely detected in the atmosphere. However, study on its toxicity toward the human respiratory system remains incomplete. Previous works have investigated toxicological mechanisms of PS in human normal lung (BEAS-2B) cells based on a single signaling pathway, which is partial and inadequate. In this work, by analyzing key protein level changes, fluorescence colocalization, and pathway inhibition, PS exposure-induced Ca2+ disorder was found to simultaneously activate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (IRE1α-XBP 1s-Chop and caspase 12) and mitochondrial signaling pathways to promote BEAS-2B cell apoptosis. By exposing these cells to different particle sizes (20, 100, and 1000 nm) and concentrations (100, 250, and 500 μg mL–1) of PS, the rule of different signaling pathways that synergistically induce toxicity in BEAS-2B cells was discerned. Conditional appearance of caspase 12 pathway and sustained coactivation of IRE1α-XBP 1s-Chop and mitochondrial pathways were proved to be related to effective PS deposition and mitochondria-associated ER membrane mediation, respectively. The synergistic signaling pathways causing aberrant BEAS-2B cell apoptosis under environmentally relevant dosages highlight the complexity of PS toxicity in the respiratory system.

It was found that the energy needed to break the first Al–O bond is significantly enhanced due to the Y3+ located in the eight-membered rings. Additionally, Cu2+-2Z and Y have a synergistic effect on the stabilization of the framework Al. The introduction of Y into the Cu-SSZ-39 catalyst with hydrothermally stable Cu2+-2Z as the only Cu species remarkably enhanced both the low-temperature activity and the hydrothermal stability. The catalyst maintained excellent deNOx activity even after hydrothermal aging at the extremely high temperature of 940 °C. Both stable Cu species and stable framework Al are essential for the design of hydrothermally stable Cu-exchanged zeolite catalysts."

Over the past decade, CDI has transitioned from a laboratory curiosity to a viable technology for desalination and resource recovery. However, rapid advancements in this field have raised concerns regarding various operational issues, including energy efficiency and fouling tendencies. Electrosorption of metal ions and hydroxides on CDI electrodes and membranes, alongside the hydrophobic interactions with organic compounds, can cause pore clogging and reduce sorption capacities, ultimately compromising cycle longevity. A comprehensive understanding of CDI (and membrane CDI) fouling is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies for full-scale applications. In this review, we summarize the principles of inorganic, organic, and composite fouling in CDI, evaluate the strengths and limitations of current fouling characterization techniques, and assess how feed/electrode properties and operating parameters influence fouling occurrence and development. Additionally, we outline existing CDI cleaning protocols and highlight research needs herein, aiming to identify new insights that will enhance the cost-effective application of this innovative technology."

In this study, we investigated how the cell wall interface of the freshwater microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii modulated Cu biotransformation. Our findings revealed that membrane-localized and intracellular Cu biotransformation might be closely linked to redox differentiation. Specifically, cell wall deficiency might alter the redox conditions in the cell wall–plasma membrane space, resulting in a significant accumulation of intracellularly labile Cu(I). This surge in labile Cu(I) caused oxidative stress by modifying the redox environment in cell-wall-deficient (CW) cells, leading to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Concurrently, these redox changes might regulate the intracellular Cu biotransformation processes, disrupting the dynamics of the intracellular labile Cu(I)/Cu(II) cycle. In response to the oxidative stress induced by abnormal Cu biotransformation, CW cells activated the GSH system to scavenge excess ROS and stabilize internalized labile Cu(I). However, prolonged disruption of Cu biotransformation led to adverse effects, including mitochondrial fragmentation and impaired photosynthetic performance. To mitigate this cytotoxicity, CW cells deployed additional detoxification strategies, such as the assembly of lysosome-related organelles and the synthesis of polyphosphate, which sequestered excess labile Cu(I) and helped to maintain cellular homeostasis."

However, simultaneously achieving the oil resistance and salt tolerance of evaporators remains challenging. In response, we proposed a self-rotating interfacial solar evaporator (SSE) with a superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic polydopamine/polypyrrole-coated nonwoven fabric (PDA/PPy-NF) layer. Such an SSE can isolate the salt and oil discharging areas, thus achieving continuous demulsification and crystallization by designedly guiding self-cleaning. Based on the torque balance theory, we established a self-cleaning cycle prediction model for an SSE. After optimizing the interface wettability, the SSE presented a high long-term evaporation rate of 1.86 kg m–2 h–1 under 1 sun, with a more than 99% oil and salt removal ratio. Taking Tianjin as an example, it is estimated that an SSE can produce freshwater with a high daily average rate of 5.5–6.5 kg m–2, and 1 m2 of an SSE can meet the daily drinking water supply for at least two adults. In conclusion, an SSE can be regarded as an ideal solution for treating saline oily wastewater, and this work is expected not only  to expand the application scope of solar evaporators but also address the current water–energy challenges, thereby accelerating the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals."

We measured nine OPFR metabolite concentrations in urine samples and assessed depressive symptoms using the Beck Depression Inventory questionnaire. In the fully adjusted linear regression models, a 2.7-fold increase in urinary diphenyl phosphate (DPHP) concentrations was associated with a 0.44 unit (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.06, 0.82) higher depressive symptom scores. When men were categorized as having any depressive symptoms (score: > 10 vs ≤ 10), Poisson regression models showed an increased risk of depression across DPHP tertiles (Ptrend = 0.08). Further, we found stronger associations between urinary OPFR metabolite concentrations and depressive symptom scores among men with a higher waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, or waist-height ratio (Pinteraction < 0.15). The machine learning algorithm identified three different patterns of obesity, and the strongest association between urinary DPHP concentrations and depressive symptom scores was observed among men with a waist-hip ratio of ≥ 0.89 and a body mass index of <24 kg/m2. In summary, exposure to OPFRs may be associated with depressive symptoms among young men, especially in those with abdominal obesity."

Here, the authors show that disrupting Golgi-endosome protein AP1M1 enhances ASO activity by prolonging ASO endosomal residence and increasing the likelihood of endosomal escape. 
 Anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are modified synthetic single-stranded molecules with enhanced stability, activity, and bioavailability. They associate with RNA through sequence complementarity and can reduce or alter mRNA expression upon binding of splice site positions. To target RNA in the nucleus or cytoplasm, ASOs must cross membranes, a poorly understood process. We performed an unbiased CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen with a genetic splice reporter to identify genes that can increase or decrease ASO activity, resulting in the most comprehensive catalog of ASO-activity modifier genes. Here we reveal distinct targets, including AP1M1 and TBC1D23, linking ASO activity to transport of cargo between the Golgi and endosomes. AP1M1 absence strongly increases ASO activity by delaying endosome-to-lysosome transport in vitro and in vivo. Prolonged ASO residence time in the endosomal system may increase the likelihood of ASO escape. This insight into AP1M1 role in ASO trafficking suggests a way for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of ASOs by manipulating the endolysosomal pathways.

Here, the authors investigate its neurotropic potential and show that neuritic transport of viral particles drives neuronal degeneration. 
 In 2022-23, the world witnessed the largest recorded outbreak of monkeypox virus (MPXV). Neurological manifestations were reported alongside the detection of MPXV DNA and MPXV-specific antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients. Here, we analyze the susceptibility of neural tissue to MPXV using human neural organoids (hNOs) exposed to a clade IIb isolate. We report susceptibility of several cell types to the virus, including neural progenitor cells and neurons. The virus efficiently replicates in hNOs, as indicated by the exponential increase of infectious viral titers and establishment of viral factories. Our findings reveal focal enrichment of viral antigen alongside accumulation of cell-associated infectious virus, suggesting viral cell-to-cell spread. Using an mNeonGreen-expressing recombinant MPXV, we confirm cell-associated virus transmission. We furthermore show the formation of beads in infected neurites, a phenomenon associated with neurodegenerative disorders. Bead appearance precedes neurite-initiated cell death, as confirmed through live-cell imaging. Accordingly, hNO-transcriptome analysis reveals alterations in cellular homeostasis and upregulation of neurodegeneration-associated transcripts, despite scarcity of inflammatory and antiviral responses. Notably, tecovirimat treatment of MPXV-infected hNOs significantly reduces infectious virus loads. Our findings suggest that viral disruption of neuritic transport drives neuronal degeneration, potentially contributing to MPXV neuropathology and revealing targets for therapeutic intervention. The mechanisms underlying neurological complications of monkeypox virus infection remain unclear.

 Geologic records support a short-lived carbon release, known as the pre-onset excursion (POE), shortly before the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; ~ 56 Ma). However, the source and pace of the POE carbon release and its relationship to the PETM remain unresolved. Here we show a high-temporal-resolution stratigraphic record spanning the POE and PETM from the eastern Tethys Ocean that documents the evolution of surface ocean carbon cycle, redox and eutrophication, confirming the global nature of the POE. Biomarkers extracted from the sedimentary record indicate a smaller environmental perturbation during the POE than that during the PETM in the eastern Tethys Ocean. Earth system modeling constrained by observed δ13C and pH data indicates that the POE was driven by a largely thermogenic CO2 source, likely associated with sill intrusions prior to the main eruption phase of the North Atlantic Igneous Province and possibly biogeochemical feedbacks involving the release of biogenic methane.

Emission inventories of BC are key inputs for atmospheric models that assess the impact of BC emissions on health and the environment. However, estimated BC emission fluxes are highly uncertain. In this study, we evaluated three emission inventories — the Community Emission Data System (CEDS), the Evaluating the Climate and Air Quality Impacts of Short-Lived Pollutants (ECLIPSE) and Global Fire Emission Database (GFED) — using the Lagrangian dispersion model FLEXPART, along with BC observations from two locations in India viz. Ahmedabad (urban) and Gadanki (rural). The modeled BC concentrations using ECLIPSE and CEDS were comparable to each other; however, the modeled BC concentrations were underestimated by a factor of 2 using these emission inventories. The annual mean biases between model and observation (observation-model) are approximately 3 μg/m3 and 1 μg/m3 at Ahmedabad (urban) and Gadanki (rural), respectively. Adding the contribution of biomass-burning sources from the GFED inventory (less than 0.01 μg/m3) did not significantly improve the bias. Open biomass burning (OBB) emissions, resulting from large-scale burning of biomass in agricultural fields, forests, and wastelands, is the largest contributor to BC concentrations globally and are highly uncertain. To investigate the underestimation of BC by the model and the role of OBB emissions in this discrepancy, a novel rank-based statistical framework is developed. This framework integrates satellite-detected fire hotspots, FLEXPART model, and ground-based observations to evaluate relative contribution of OBB emissions to BC concentrations. We find that OBB emissions are not a significant source of BC concentrations over Ahmedabad (23.03°N, 72.55°E). In contrast, BC emissions from OBB are underestimated at Gadanki (13.48°N, 79.18°E). The framework used to evaluate cause-effect relation between OBB and BC can help constrain better the sources of BC. This framework can be readily extended globally to evaluate other sectors where emission activity data can be observed using satellites."
