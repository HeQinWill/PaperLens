10.1029/2024JD041441,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这项研究利用卫星被动微波（PMW）和星载降水雷达（PR）观测数据，调查了经历昼夜脉冲（DP）的热带气旋（TC）的云和降水结构变化。研究人员匹配了来自红外卫星图像客观识别的TC的DP和非DP事件的4677个PMW和3074个PR快照。结果表明，与非DP事件相比，当发生DP时，包含冰和液态粒子的内芯（0-100公里）冷云变得更加频繁和广泛。冷云的DP相关增强最大发生在弱TC（热带风暴）的下切左象限和中强（≥CAT 1）飓风的迎风区。此外，即使在高风切变（>10 ms−1）环境下，DP事件的内芯冷云也保持相对对称的分布。受液态水合物支配的内芯暖云在DP事件期间在风切变右侧区域增加，但在左侧区域减少。类似地，PR回波顶高统计数据显示，尤其对于弱TC，DP事件期间TC内区（0-300公里）的中度到深对流显着增加。特别是，迎风右象限在DP事件期间中度到深对流的增加最大。这些变化导致TC内区具有更深、更对称的对流结构，并伴随DP的发生。总的来说，该研究利用多种卫星遥感技术，分析热带气旋云和降水结构，与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['cloud structure', 'precipitation', 'tropical cyclone', 'passive microwave', 'spaceborne precipitation radar', 'satellite observations', 'infrared satellite images', 'atmospheric composition']",Xinyan Zhang;Weixin Xu,Changes in the Deep Convective Structures of Tropical Cyclones Associated With the Diurnal Pulse,"This study uses satellite passive microwave (PMW) and spaceborne precipitation radar (PR) observations to investigate changes in the cloud and precipitation structures of tropical cyclones (TCs) experiencing diurnal pulses (DPs). A total of 4677 PMW and 3074 PR snapshots are matched with DP and non‐DP events of TCs objectively identified from infrared satellite images. The PMW observations suggest that compared to non‐DP events, the inner‐core (0–100 km) cold clouds containing both ice and liquid particles become more frequent and widespread when DP occurs. The greatest DP‐associated enhancement of cold clouds occurs in the downshear left quadrant of weak TCs (tropical storms) and in the upshear region of moderate‐to‐strong (≥ CAT 1) hurricanes, respectively. Also, the inner‐core cold clouds of DP events still maintain a relatively symmetric distribution under high‐shear (>10 ms−1) environments compared to non‐DP counterparts. The inner‐core warm cloud, dominated by liquid hydrometeors, increases in regions right of the shear but decreases left of the shear during DP events. Similarly, PR echo‐top height statistics show significant increases of moderate‐to‐deep convection in the TC inner region (0–300 km) on DP events especially for weak TCs. Particularly, the upshear‐right quadrant has the greatest increase in moderate‐to‐deep convection during DP events. These changes lead to a deeper and more symmetric convective structure of TCs' inner region with the occurrence of DPs."

This method is similar to the lightning DA (LDA) technique discussed in Fierro et al. (2012), https://doi.org/10.1175/mwr‐d‐11‐00299.1, wherein lightning data is used to nudge a column toward saturation by increasing water vapor mixing ratio. For the present study, vertically integrated ice (VII) is used in lieu of lightning to introduce virtual thermal buoyancy in the updraft column. Since VII is indicative of deep convective updrafts, VII DA should introduce buoyant updrafts before the appearance of lightning while also decreasing errors in timing and location of convection initiation. This study demonstrates the skill of the VII method compared to both a control simulation and a LDA simulation."

Historical climate data from 1985 to 2014, sourced from the Climatic Research Unit Time‐Series, Version 3.22 (CRU TS 3.22), was analyzed to comprehend past climate patterns and establish a baseline for future comparisons. Predictions for future climate conditions (2015–2044) were derived by adjusting the CRU data using temperature projections from the Community Climate System Model 4 under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario. To assess the potential impacts of these climate changes, particularly during the boreal summer season of July‐August‐September (JAS), the study utilized the Hydrology, Entomology, and Malaria Transmission Simulator (HYDREMATS). Findings indicate that surface temperature can intricately influence disease transmission, with varied effects on parameters such as Ro, EIR, prevalence, and immunity index. Observations revealed fluctuations in temperature anomalies over the years, with negative anomalies in 1991–1995 and positive anomalies in subsequent years. Although precise predictions for 2016–2044 are challenging based solely on data trends from 1985 to 2015, continued temperature rises could potentially lead to increased disease prevalence and decreased immunity index. Moreover, the analysis identified a notable temporal increase in mean annual temperature and mean annual maximum temperature from 1999 to 2020, suggesting a faster warming trend in maximum temperatures compared to minimum temperatures. This increase in temperature variability may alter the onset and cessation dates of the rainy season, affecting water availability, accessibility, and consumption, consequently fostering conditions conducive to health‐related diseases. By incorporating predicted long‐term temperature changes due to greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining current inter‐annual climate patterns, this approach allows researchers to anticipate potential future health implications in the studied regions."

 Light photometric and polarimetric characteristics are crucial for describing the optical properties of leaf reflections, which play an essential role in investigating biochemical and surface structural trait inversion and radiative balance between vegetation and atmospheric system. Although several physical models are available, research on a comprehensive model that accounts for both photometric and polarimetric characteristics and incorporates biochemical and surface structural traits is still inadequate. In this study, we introduced PROPOLAR, a leaf model that considered leaf reflection in terms of polarized and unpolarized components and linked leaf reflection to leaf traits. PROPOLAR employed PROSPECT to simulate non-polarized component associated with biochemical traits, while used a three-parameter function (linear coefficient, refractive index factor, and roughness of leaf surface) to simulate the polarized component. The model was validated using a dataset (composed of both photometric and polarimetric measurements) collected from 533 samples of 13 plant species under various illumination-viewing geometries. The results showed that PROPOLAR outperformed PROSPECT and PROSPECULAR (a leaf model charactering BRF) in simulating light intensity (R2 = 0.98), and effectively simulated bidirectional polarization reflectance factor (BPRF) and degree of linear polarization (Dolp) across a wide spectral range (450–2300 nm) and species, with R2 = 0.92, and 0.80, respectively. Furthermore, PROPOLAR enhanced the accuracy of PROSPECT and showed comparable accuracy with PROSPECULAR in the inversion of biochemical traits from the multi-angular polarization measurements, including chlorophyll (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 12.83 μg/cm2), equivalent water thickness (R2 = 0.90, RMSE = 0.0032 g/cm2), and leaf mass per area (R2 = 0.38, RMSE = 0.0031 g/cm2), due to the incorporation of polarization reflection and a linear coefficient during calibration. Notably, PROPOLAR can invert roughness and showed reasonable consistency with measured roughness (R2 = 0.61). These results demonstrated the effectiveness of PROPOLAR in simulating both photometric and polarimetric properties of leaf reflection, as well as its potential for biochemical and surface structural trait inversion. PROPOLAR may advance remote sensing applications in vegetation management by integrating photometric and polarimetric properties."

10.1016/j.jag.2024.104321,False,International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation,这篇论文关注的是利用多源异构遥感影像进行变化检测的方法。它提出了一种新的框架，该框架首先使用知识约束循环一致生成对抗网络 (KCGAN) 生成伪同质图像对，然后使用多模态差值孪生融合网络 (MDSiamF) 从这些图像对中提取变化信息。论文的重点在于改进变化检测的算法和精度，并没有直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等。因此，它与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。,[],Huifu Zhuang;Jianlin Guo;Ming Hao;Sen Du;Kefei Zhang;Xuesong Wang,Change detection in heterogeneous images based on multiple pseudo-homogeneous image pairs,"•The domain knowledge of change detection was incorporated into the design of KCGAN. •The domain knowledge of generating difference image is incorporated into the design of MDSiamF. •A novel framework for extracting change information from multiple pseudo-homogeneous image pairs was designed. •The complementary features of HRSIs were effectively integrated by MDSiamF net. 
 Due to the significant disparities in feature spaces of multi-source images, change detection (CD) of heterogeneous remote sensing images (HRSIs) remains a highly challenging problem. Currently, CD methods based on domain transfer networks (DTNs) have garnered significant attention. However, the computer scientists underutilize knowledge in the field of CD during DTNs design, and the existing CD methods do not fully utilize the heterogeneous complementary features contained in HRSIs. Therefore, this study proposes a novel CD method based on multiple pseudo-homogeneous image pairs. First, a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network with knowledge constraints (named as KCGAN) was designed for obtaining good pseudo-homogeneous images. In detail, both the domain knowledge that there are land cover changes in multi-temporal images and that the objects in an image can be described from different scales were well integrated into the design of KCGAN. Then, a multi-modal difference Siamese fusion network (named as MDSiamF) was proposed to extract change information from the multiple pseudo-homogeneous image pairs generated with KCGAN. Experiments conducted on three datasets showed that: 1) compared to existing domain transfer methods, the unchanged areas in the pseudo-homogeneous images obtained by KCGAN exhibit better feature consistency (with a peak signal-to-noise ratio higher than 20.85 and a PHash value higher than 0.9); 2) compared to state-of-the-art methods for CD of HRSIs, the proposed method shows stable and good CD performance (with an overall accuracy higher than 0.98 and a F1 Score higher than 0.78)."

 The oxidative potential (OP) of airborne particulate matter (PM) is a valuable metric for assessing PM toxicity. Here we present an online system capable of measuring OP using the acellular dithiothreitol (DTT) assay with hourly resolution. The system consists of a particle-into-liquid sampler (PILS) as online sampling component, a solution distribution, mixing and heating module, and a detection module. Compared with existing automated systems described in the literature, our system is distinctly different in the design of the detection module. Our design is simpler, less expensive, and easier to maintain, thus more desirable for long-term field deployment. The improved features are realized through using a more durable visible light source and a simpler flow cell. Our system is tailored to achieve high analytical precision in measuring minute changes in light absorbance. The system provides a limit of detection of 0.027 μM/min or 0.84 nmol/min/m3, based on measurements of ambient blank samples. During a field deployment with hourly PM2.5 in the range of ∼2–31 μg/m3, it enables determination of 99.9% of hourly samples (N = 704) above detection limit. Compared to previous systems, our system provides comparable precision (CV = 2–8%) and better consistency with offline method (slope: 1.06, intercept: 0.02, R2: 0.99). We field-tested the system for one-month at a suburban site in Hong Kong. The average field blank corrected OP was 3.18 ± 2.20 nmol/min/m3, corresponding to ambient PM2.5 concentrations averaged at 10.5 ± 6.1 μg/m3. Over the PM2.5 mass range encountered, the relationship between OP and PM2.5 exhibited an increasing trend of OP with PM2.5 up to ∼13 μg/m3, after which it reached a plateau. Within a narrow PM2.5 mass bin of 5 μg/m3, considerable sample-to-sample variation in OP was observed. The system effectively captured a rapid rise in OP as the dominant wind direction shifted from southerly, bringing in clean marine air, to northerly, transporting polluted air. We have demonstrated the adequate sensitivity of our system for monitoring OP of ambient PM2.5 at an hourly resolution. By offering real-time measurements, this system has the potential to enhance our understanding of the dynamic nature of PM toxicity and its implications for human health."
