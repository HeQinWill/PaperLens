10.1088/1748-9326/ad893e,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究了印度地区季节性陆气相互作用中的滞后现象，重点关注农田和森林两种土地覆盖类型。研究利用卫星遥感数据（例如植被光学厚度和土壤湿度）揭示了土壤-植被系统在印度夏季风期间储水和非季风干旱期支持蒸散发（ET）的关键作用。文章发现，农田和森林的“土壤-植被电容效应”（即非季风期蒸散发量超过降水量）持续时间存在显著差异，并首次报道了印度农田和森林蒸散发分数（EVF）与土壤湿度之间季节性滞后关系的现象。此外，研究还发现农田的这种滞后关系在根区土壤湿度情况下会发生反转，而森林由于根系深且冠层遮荫减少土壤蒸发，则仅在根区土壤湿度上存在滞后现象。该研究强调了在陆面模型参数化中考虑这种滞后现象的必要性，以及改进生态和水文模型的必要性。总而言之，该研究利用卫星遥感技术观测土壤湿度、植被状况等，定量分析了陆地生态系统与大气环境之间的相互作用，并揭示了其中一些关键的非线性动力学过程。,"['Evapotranspiration', 'Soil moisture', 'Vegetation optical depth', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'Land surface modeling', 'Indian Summer Monsoon', 'Hysteresis', 'Gross primary productivity', 'Remote sensing of land surface', 'Seasonal variations']",Ajinkya Khandare;Raghu Murtugudde;L Karthikeyan;Subimal Ghosh,Hysteresis in seasonal land-atmospheric interactions over India and its characteristics across croplands and forests,"Satellite-derived vegetation optical depth and soil moisture (SM) data reveal the critical role of the soil-vegetation continuum in storing rainwater during the Indian Summer Monsoon and supporting evapotranspiration (ET) during the dry non-monsoon season. During the non-monsoon drier period, the climatologically estimated spatial mean of ET exceeds precipitation input, a phenomenon known as the soil–vegetation capacitor effect, which is pivotal in maintaining ecosystem productivity. Notably, our analysis reveals significant variations in the capacitor period between croplands and forests, with croplands exhibiting a ∼77 d longer due to dual crop seasons influenced by regional precipitation. The well-recognized hysteresis curves, observed in magnetization and soil–water characteristic curves, highlight phenomena where a system’s state is influenced by its historical inputs or states and are integral to our findings. We report a previously undocumented seasonal hysteresis in the relationship between the evaporative fraction (EVF) and SM for Indian croplands and forests. We further found that the croplands SM-EVF relation exhibits a reversal in hysteresis in the case of root-zone SM. The surface SM-EVF hysteresis is not present in forests with large root depths and reduced soil evaporation due to high canopy shading, and yet it is present for the root-zone SM. With its reversal for croplands, the newly found hysteresis must be addressed in redefining the critical SM threshold to demarcate the energy and water-limiting regimes. It should be incorporated in the land surface modeling parameterization. Additionally, we observed hysteresis in the SM-gross primary productivity relationship across both land covers and soil profiles (surface and root-zone), underscoring the need to investigate such processes to consider their dynamics in future ecological and hydrological models."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad8a73,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究了中国南方以稻田为主的秦淮河流域城市化和气候变化对水碳平衡的综合影响。研究利用改进的生态系统服务模型，结合涡动通量观测和高分辨率遥感数据，分析了2001-2018年城市化进程中不透水面积增加、稻田减少对蒸散发（ET）、总初级生产力（GPP）和水产量（Q）的影响。结果表明，城市化导致ET和GPP显著下降，水产量显著增加。模型实验表明，稻田减少和不透水面积增加对ET和GPP的负面影响超过了气候变暖的正面影响。研究认为，不透水面积的增加是GPP下降和Q增加的主要原因，这与土地利用类型变化（例如城市面积）的关系并不直接。该研究强调了在气候变化和土地表面特征变化背景下，通过关键的蒸散发过程，碳循环和水循环相互作用的重要性，并为城市自然解决方案的设计提供了信息。虽然研究使用了遥感数据，但这主要用于监测土地利用变化和估算植被覆盖等，并非直接针对大气成分分析或空气质量监测等大气环境遥感技术。,"['evapotranspiration', 'remote sensing', 'carbon cycle', 'water cycle', 'land surface temperature', 'urbanization']",Dongxu Chen;Ning Liu;Guojing Gan;Yuanbo Liu;Mengsheng Qin;Qingzhou Zheng;Ge Sun;Lu Hao,Combined effects of urbanization and climate variability on water and carbon balances in a rice paddy-dominated basin in southern China,"Urbanization is known to elevate storm runoff, but how it influences carbon cycle and ecosystem productivity through altering the evapotranspiration (ET) process is less clear. We examined the combined effects of urbanization including change in impervious surface area (ISA) and climate variability on the water and carbon balances of the Qinhuai River Basin (QRB) over 2001–2018. QRB represents a typical rice paddy-dominated region that experienced rapid urbanization in southern China. We improved a monthly scale water supply stress index ecosystem service model by integrating local eddy flux measurements and high-resolution remote sensing data. We found a significant downward trend in both ET (−4.6 mm yr−1, p < 0.05) and gross primary productivity (GPP) (−10.4 gC m−2 yr−1, p < 0.05) but a significant upward trend in water yield (Q) (+28.6 mm yr−1, p < 0.05). These ecosystem function changes coincided with a 96% increase in urban areas, 1.9-fold increase in ISA, and a 37% reduction in rice paddy fields. The mean annual watershed GPP decreased from 1048 gC m−2 to 998 gC m−2 while the annual Q increased from 284 mm to 669 mm from 2001 to 2018. Scenario modeling experiments suggested that the negative impacts of loss of rice paddy fields and increase in ISA on ET and GPP overwhelmed the positive impacts of climate warming. The reduction in GPP and increase in Q were largely attributed to the increases in ISA, not necessarily due to changes in land use types (e.g. urban area). The expansion of urban area, increase in ISA and reduction in leaf area index, and increase in precipitation explained the increase in Q. Our research offers insight about the interactions of carbon and water cycles through the critical ET processes under a changing climate and land surface characteristics at a watershed level. Our modeling tool and analysis provides land managers and policy makers information for designing effective ‘Urban Nature-based Solutions’ to mitigate the negative environmental effects of urbanization on carbon and water resources."

To better understand future changes under different emission scenarios, we used the Open Global Glacier Model to simulate glacier dynamics and runoff changes from 2015 to 2100. The results show that their area and volume will decrease by 38.88% (SSP1-2.6) to 60.84% (SSP5-8.5) and 47.56% (SSP1-2.6) to 67.10% (SSP5-8.5) by 2100, with regions that have larger glacierized areas and are farther from the ocean experiencing less volume loss. Meanwhile, the predicted surface mass balance of Greenland’s peripheral GICs in 2100 is −0.58 ± 0.92, −1.18 ± 1.13, −2.04 ± 0.79 and −3.16 ± 0.96 m w.e. a−1 under four emission scenarios. The runoff under higher emission scenarios is larger than that under lower emission scenarios, with peak water occurring later in regions that have larger glacierized areas and are farther from the ocean."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad8bdc,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究了利用深度学习方法改进阿拉斯加野火预测和碳通量估算。它开发了一个名为FireDL的两阶段深度学习模型，结合LSTM和ANN算法，利用闪电、植被和气候数据集预测野火发生、持续时间和过火面积。该模型的预测结果被整合到CLM5-BGC陆面模型中，以改进碳排放估算。研究发现，FireDL显著提高了对大型野火的预测精度，并将2019年（当年过火面积最大）的净生态系统交换量（NEE）估算值提高了一倍。这表明改进野火预测对准确估算碳排放和理解其对大气CO2浓度的影响至关重要，对气候变化研究和生态系统管理具有重要意义。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它利用了卫星观测数据（例如植被覆盖、气象数据等）来预测野火，并估算由此产生的碳排放，这直接关系到大气成分分析（特别是CO2浓度）和空气质量监测。,"['carbon dioxide', 'carbon fluxes', 'carbon emissions', 'satellite observations', 'burned area', 'wildfires', 'climate change', 'atmospheric CO2', 'NEE (Net Ecosystem Exchange)', 'fire prediction']",Hocheol Seo;Yeonjoo Kim,Enhancing Alaskan wildfire prediction and carbon flux estimation: a two-stage deep learning approach within a process-based model,"Wildfires in boreal forests release substantial amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. However, current land-surface models are limited in their representation of fire processes, including their ignition and spread. This study thus developed FireDL, a novel data-driven machine-learning model for the prediction of natural wildfires, and combined it with a land-surface model to better understand the impact of fire on carbon fluxes. FireDL has a two-stage deep learning structure that sequentially combines a long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm and an artificial neural network (ANN). Preliminary random forest analysis identified fire duration as an important factor in predicting the burned area. Thus, in FireDL, the LSTM algorithm was employed to predict fire occurrence and duration, utilizing lightning, vegetation, and climate datasets. Subsequently, the ANN predicted the total burned area using the LTSM-derived fire duration predictions and climate datasets as input. FireDL produced a robust performance in predicting large fires (>10 000 ha), achieving a correlation coefficient of 0.72. The daily-scaled burned area predictions derived from FireDL were integrated into the Community Land Model version 5—Biogeochemistry (CLM5-BGC) to produce CLM5-BGC-FireDL. This integration considerably improved carbon emission estimations. Notably, the total net ecosystem exchange (NEE) estimated using CLM5-BGC-FireDL in 2019, the year with the highest recorded burned area during our study, was twice that estimated using the standard CLM5-BGC. Discrepancies in the NEE can significantly influence atmospheric CO2 levels, highlighting the importance of our fire prediction model in forecasting the burned area and carbon emissions. The use of FireDL with future climate scenarios is thus anticipated to yield valuable insights into ecosystem management and climate change mitigation strategies."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad8bdd,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文关注的是中国哈密地区风能资源的高分辨率评估。研究利用高分辨率ERA5再分析数据和先进的风力涡轮机技术，评估了该地区风能的潜力，包括风速模式、涡轮机高度和地理限制等因素。研究发现哈密地区风能潜力巨大，并在东部地区识别出一个新的高潜力区域。该研究与大气环境遥感技术（例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）关系不大，其主要关注的是风能资源的评估和开发，属于可再生能源和能源工程领域。,"['wind speed', 'wind energy', 'ERA5 reanalysis data', 'wind turbine technology', 'wind power generation']",Jiayu Xu;Yiheng Tao;Shuai Yang;Junyu Zou;Weili Duan;Yuntian Chen;Fan Ye;Jiangmin Ning;Zhenzhong Zeng,High-resolution assessment of wind energy potential in the Hami region of Northwestern China,"Wind energy plays a pivotal role in the global effort to mitigate climate change, with China emerging as a leader in renewable energy adoption. The Hami region in northwestern China stands out as a crucial area for wind power development, given its substantial wind resources and strategic importance in China’s energy landscape. However, existing studies on wind energy potential vary widely and involve large uncertainties due to sparse measurements and coarse resolution, highlighting the need for more precise assessments to guide policy decisions and optimize energy utilization. This study leverages high-resolution ERA5 reanalysis data and advanced wind turbine technology to assess wind energy potential in the Hami region, taking into account factors including wind speed patterns, turbine heights, and geographical constraints. The comparison with in-situ data demonstrated that high-resolution ERA5 reanalyzed wind speeds enable to capture multi-year wind speed variations in this region. We find substantial potential for wind energy in Hami, with energy densities exceeding 200 W m−2 in the high-potential wind zones. Importantly, this study identifies a new high-potential area in eastern Hami, termed the East Wind Zone. Our high-resolution assessment of wind energy potential at different heights over the past two decades reveals long-term trends and seasonal variations. Increasing the hub height from 95 m to 140 m raises the average wind power generation potential across Hami by 31.3 GWh yr−1. Our findings highlight the importance of strategic wind farm placement to maximize renewable energy output and provide insights for policy and industry, supporting China’s renewable energy goals."

High sea levels and seawater flooding can drive groundwater table rise via ocean-aquifer connections. These dynamics are often overlooked but can cause groundwater flooding and salinization hazards, increasing freshwater security challenges for coastal communities and driving ecosystem transgressions. Field data and numerical modeling were used to evaluate how heavy rainfall, storm surge, and seawater flooding and infiltration during Hurricane Fiona (September 2022) and projected SLR impact groundwater levels, inland surface waters, and saltwater intrusion on Sable Island National Park Reserve, Canada. During the passage of Hurricane Fiona, precipitation increased groundwater and pond levels before seawater flooded the beach. Seawater flooding and infiltration caused a sharp rise in beach groundwater levels, which in turn caused inland pond levels to rise without coincident direct inputs from precipitation or seawater. Model simulations reveal that seawater infiltration on beaches flooded the subsurface and drove the observed inland groundwater rise and freshwater pond expansion. Simulations of projected SLR show that seawater flooding will only inundate a small area of land along the coast; however, inland groundwater rise and flooding, which is less well-studied, may inundate up to 30 times more land area. Further, groundwater flooding driven by rising sea levels decreases hydraulic gradients and increases saltwater intrusion via freshwater lens (FWL) contraction. Findings demonstrate that seawater flooding from coastal storms and SLR paradoxically cause concurrent fresh surface water expansion but FWL contraction. This study provides new insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of island freshwater resources and highlights that unseen and often overlooked groundwater-surface water exchanges are critical to consider when evaluating coastal flooding and groundwater salinization hazards and management strategies for low-elevation coastlines."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad8c6a,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文关注的是利用区域气候模式CWRF对两种全球气候模式(GCMs)进行降尺度，从而改进对中国东部复合型干旱和高温事件(CDHEs)的模拟。研究发现，CWRF降尺度显著改善了GCMs对CDHEs历史模拟的低估，使其与观测趋势更一致。CWRF在模拟CDHEs方面的改进比对单一事件(极端干旱和极端高温)的改进更为显著，这主要归因于CWRF对地气相互作用过程的更好表达。研究预测，在SSP245和SSP585情景下，CWRF降尺度预测区域平均CDHE频率将比GCMs更快地上升，到21世纪中期可能接近或超过0.4，这预示着对研究区域构成重大未来威胁。总的来说，该研究强调了地气相互作用在塑造CDHEs中的重要作用，以及区域气候模式在降低复合事件模拟不确定性方面的有效性。该研究主要集中在气候模拟和预测领域，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。,"['drought', 'heat extremes', 'land-atmosphere interaction', 'climate modeling', 'downscaling', 'GCMs', 'CWRF', 'SSP245', 'SSP585']",Han Zhang;Shulei Zhang;Haoran Xu;Guwei Zhang;Yongjiu Dai;Xin-Zhong Liang,Improved simulation of compound drought and heat extremes in eastern China through CWRF downscaling,"Given their profound socio-economic impact and increasing occurrence, compound drought and heat extremes (CDHEs) have become a focal point of widespread concern. Studies have attempted to reproduce and predict these extremes using general circulation models (GCMs); however, the performance of these models in capturing compound events remains controversial. This study presents an improved simulation of CDHE trends over eastern China by using the regional Climate-Weather Research and Forecasting model (CWRF) to downscale the projections of two GCMs that participated in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6. The results show that CWRF downscaling significantly improved the underestimation of CDHE trends in GCM historical simulations, aligning better with observed trends. Moreover, the improvements of CWRF downscaling in simulating CDHEs are more pronounced than those for univariate events, i.e. extreme drought and extreme heat events. This enhancement largely results from CWRF’s better representation of land-atmosphere interaction processes, as indicated by the more realistic spatial distributions and intensities of the land-atmosphere coupling strength index. Under the SSP245 and SSP585 scenario, CWRF downscaling again predicts a more rapid increase in regional mean CDHE frequency compared to GCMs, with values nearing or exceeding 0.4 by the mid-21st century, suggesting a significant future threat to the study region. This study highlights the important role of land-atmosphere interactions in shaping CDHEs and the efficacy of regional climate models to reduce uncertainty in compound event simulations."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad8c6c,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要关注的是利用地球系统模型模拟21世纪末大气N2O浓度的变化。研究使用了六种共享社会经济路径（SSPs）情景，并考虑了氮肥施用量等因素。结果表明，尽管不同减排情景下N2O浓度变化范围较小，但与SSPs实验中提供的N2O浓度相比存在较大差异。这可能是因为研究中没有充分考虑强减排假设，需要大幅减少农业N2O排放。研究还指出，改进地球系统模型的关键在于更好地模拟海洋中氧气减少对N2O动力学的影响，以及陆地厌氧土壤和农业动态（包括氮肥减排措施）。总的来说，这是一项关于气候变化和大气成分建模研究，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大，没有涉及到具体的遥感技术、传感器或卫星观测数据。,"['N2O', 'Greenhouse gas', 'Atmospheric composition', 'Earth System Model', 'Climate change']",M De Sisto;C Somes;A Landolfi;A H MacDougall,Projecting atmospheric N2O rise until the end of the 21st century: an Earth System Model study,"Nitrous Oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas with a centennial-scale lifetime that contributes significantly to global warming. It is emitted from natural and anthropogenic sources. In nature, N2O is released mainly from nitrification and denitrification from the ocean and terrestrial systems. The use of agricultural fertilizers has significantly increased the emission of N2O in the past century. Here we present, to our knowledge, the first coupled ocean and terrestrial N2O modules within an Earth System Model. The coupled modules were used to simulate the six Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) scenarios with available nitrogen fertilizer inputs. Our results are compared to projections of atmospheric N2O concentrations used for SSPs scenario experiments. Additionally, an extra set of simulations were prescribed with emulated N2O concentrations available as input in Shared Socioeconomic Pathways scenarios. We report four main drivers for terrestrial N2O uncertainties: atmospheric temperature, agricultural fertilizer input, soil denitrification and agricultural model dynamics. We project an atmospheric N2O concentration range from 401 to 418 ppb in six SSPs simulations with a robust lack of sensitivity to equilibrium climate sensitivity. We found a large difference between our low emission scenarios N2O concentrations by 2100 compared to the concentration provided for SSPs experiments. This divergence is likely explained by strong mitigation assumptions that were not accounted for in this study, which would require a substantial decrease of agricultural N2O emissions. The coupled model and the simulations prescribed with N2O concentrations showed a difference between −0.02 and 0.09 ∘C by 2100. Our model simulation shows a lack of sensitivity to climate mitigation efforts projecting similar N2O concentration in low and high mitigation scenarios, that could indicate the need of further development of agricultural model dynamics. Further improvements in Earth system models should focus on the impact of oxygen decline on N2O dynamics in the ocean and the representation of anaerobic soils and agricultural dynamics on land, including mitigation methods on nitrogen fertilizers."

An implication of this hypothesis is that forest and savanna may be bistable and exhibit tipping behavior in response to changing conditions. However, we pose that the local presence of forest and savanna within coexistence landscapes is not sufficient evidence that these are alternative stable states at larger ecosystem scales. Therefore, we explore forest-savanna coexistence and bistability at landscape scale in Central Africa. Using remote sensing data on tree cover, we classify 0.1° × 0.1° (approx. 10 × 10 km) landscapes as homogeneous forest, homogeneous savanna, or coexistence, and analyze the roles of climate, topography and soil sand content in driving their distributions. We find that local coexistence of forest and savanna within landscapes is common and occurs for the whole range of mean annual precipitation in our study area. At low precipitation, however, coexistence increases with topographic roughness and is therefore likely driven by local redistribution of resources rather than internal feedbacks. Coexistence within intermediate and high precipitation landscapes remains unexplained by the studied variables, and may be caused either by heterogeneity in unmeasured drivers or by feedback-driven bistability. At landscape scale, the precipitation ranges for which homogeneous forest and savanna occur have only limited overlap, and this overlap can be largely explained by other external drivers, such as seasonality, soil sand content, and topography. This lack of evidence that homogeneous forest and savanna in Central Africa are alternative ecosystem states at this landscape scale means that transitions between them may be mostly local, resulting in coexistence states. Therefore, we conclude that the likelihood of large-scale tipping between homogeneous forest and savanna ecosystems may be lower than previously thought."

In this way, climate change creates a syndemic, with undernutrition, immunity, and infectious disease risk adversely interacting. This scoping review aims to map: (1) trends in research about climate change impacts on food security; and (2) the extent to which food security is connected to the immune system and infectious diseases in published climate change research in North America. Using a scoping review process, we identified studies that described food security in the context of climate change in North America. A search string was developed and used to search five electronic databases for articles without language restriction. Data on food security pillars and their relationship with infectious diseases and the immune system were extracted from relevant articles and descriptively synthesized. We identified 204 published articles that met the inclusion criteria. The number of articles linking climate change to food security in North America increased yearly, with regional differences in the number of publications, climate variables analyzed, and study methods used. At least one connection between food security and the immune system or infectious diseases was discussed in 72 articles (35.3%). Of these, eleven articles mentioned both the immune system and infectious diseases and separately described their relationship with food security. However, only eight articles linked or described the relationship between food, immune systems, and infection—for example, by describing extreme weather events that reduced food security, resulting in malnutrition causing immunosuppression, thereby increasing the likelihood of infections. This highlights a gap in research on the adverse interaction between undernutrition, the immune system, and infectious disease risk in the context of climate change. This review underscores the need to study the interconnected and cascading health outcomes of climate change."

This study seeks to understand the factors driving these models by comparing long-term datasets of biogenic compounds to modeled emissions.

 Climate change will bring about changes in meteorological and ecological factors that are currently used in global-scale models to calculate biogenic emissions. By comparing long-term datasets of biogenic compounds to modeled emissions, this work seeks to improve understanding of these models and their driving factors. We compare speciated biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) measurements at the Virginia Forest Research Laboratory located in Fluvanna County, VA, USA, for the year 2020 with emissions estimated by the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature version 3.2 (MEGANv3.2). The emissions were subjected to oxidation in a 0-D box model (F0AM v4.3) to generate time series of modeled concentrations. We find that default light-dependent fractions (LDFs) in the emissions model do not accurately represent observed temporal variability in regional observations. Some monoterpenes with a default light dependence are better represented using light-independent emissions throughout the year (LDFα-pinene=0, as opposed to 0.6), while others are best represented using a seasonally or temporally dependent light dependence. For example, limonene has the highest correlation between modeled and measured concentrations using an LDF =0 for January through April and roughly 0.74–0.97 in the summer months, in contrast to the default value of 0.4. The monoterpenes β-thujene, sabinene, and γ-terpinene similarly have an LDF that varies throughout the year, with light-dependent behavior in summer, while camphene and α-fenchene follow light-independent behavior throughout the year. Simulations of most compounds are consistently underpredicted in the winter months compared to observed concentrations. In contrast, day-to-day variability in the concentrations during summer months are relatively well captured using the coupled emissions–chemistry model constrained by regional concentrations of NOX and O3."

These living datasets are updated every year to provide the highest transparency and traceability in the reporting of CO2, the key driver of climate change. 
 Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere in a changing climate is critical to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe and synthesise datasets and methodologies to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFOS) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC) are based on land-use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly, and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) is estimated with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based fCO2-products. The terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) is estimated with dynamic global vegetation models. Additional lines of evidence on land and ocean sinks are provided by atmospheric inversions, atmospheric oxygen measurements and Earth System Models. The sum of all sources and sinks results in the carbon budget imbalance (BIM), a measure of imperfect data and incomplete understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as ±1σ."

 Climate-related studies need information about the distribution of stratospheric aerosols, which influence the energy balance of the Earth's atmosphere. In this work, we present a merged dataset of vertically resolved stratospheric aerosol extinction coefficients, which is derived using data from six limb and occultation satellite instruments: SAGE (Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment) II on ERBS (Earth Radiation Budget Satellite), GOMOS (Global Ozone Monitoring by Occultation of Stars) and SCIAMACHY (Scanning Imaging Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography) on Envisat, OSIRIS (Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imaging System) on Odin, OMPS (Ozone Monitor Profiling Suite Limb Profiler) on Suomi NPP, and SAGE III on the ISS (International Space Station).The merging of aerosol profiles is performed via the transformation of the aerosol datasets from individual satellite instruments to the same wavelength (750 nm) and their de-biasing and homogenization by adjusting the seasonal cycles. After such homogenization, the data from individual satellite instruments are in good agreement. The merged aerosol extinction coefficient is computed as the median of the adjusted data from the individual instruments.The merged time series of vertically resolved monthly mean aerosol extinction coefficients at 750 nm is provided in 10° latitudinal bins from 90° S to 90° N, in the altitude range from 8.5 to 39.5 km. The time series of the stratospheric aerosol optical depth (SAOD) is created via the integration of aerosol extinction profiles from the tropopause to 39.5 km; it is also provided as monthly mean data in 10° latitudinal bins. The created aerosol climate record covers the period from October 1984 until December 2023, and it is intended to be extended in the future.

These maps were developed by integrating remote sensing data, irrigation statistics and surveys, and an irrigation suitability map. CIrrMap250 achieved high accuracy and outperformed currently available products. The new irrigation maps revealed a clear expansion of China’s irrigation area, with the majority (61%) occurring in the water-unsustainable regions facing severe to extreme water stress. 
 Accurate maps of irrigation extent and dynamics are crucial for studying food security and its far-reaching impacts on Earth systems and the environment. While several efforts have been made to map irrigated area in China, few have provided multiyear maps, incorporated national land surveys, addressed data discrepancies, and considered the fractional coverage of cropland within coarse-resolution pixels. Here, we addressed these important gaps and developed new annual maps of China's irrigated cropland from 2000 to 2020, named CIrrMap250 (China's irrigation map with a 250 m resolution). We harmonized irrigation statistics and surveys and reconciled them with remote sensing data. The refined estimates of irrigated area were then integrated with multiple remote sensing data (i.e. vegetation indices, hybrid cropland products, and paddy field maps) and an irrigation suitability map by means of a semi-automatic training approach. We evaluated our CIrrMap250 maps using ∼ 20 000 reference samples, high-resolution irrigation water withdrawal data, and existing local to nationwide maps. Our CIrrMap250 maps demonstrated an overall accuracy of 0.79–0.88 for the years 2000, 2010, and 2020 and outperformed currently available maps. The CIrrMap250-estimated irrigation area explained 50 %–60 % of the variance in irrigation water withdrawal across China. CIrrMap250 revealed that China's irrigation area increased by about 180 000 km2 (or 25 %) from 2000 to 2020, with the majority (61 %) occurring in the water-unsustainable regions facing severe to extreme water stress. Moreover, our product unveiled a noticeable northward shift of China's irrigation area, attributed to substantial expansions in irrigated cropland across northeastern and northwestern China. The accurate representation of irrigation extent in CIrrMap250 will greatly support hydrologic, agricultural, and climate studies in China, aiding in improved water and land resources management.

Soils are the largest carbon stores on land, making it essential to understand how much carbon they hold to fight climate change. Our study improved estimates of soil carbon in peninsular Spain by integrating historical soil data and using machine-learning methods to create detailed maps of carbon content. These maps will help manage soil carbon better and support efforts to track carbon emissions globally. 
 Human activities have significantly disrupted the global carbon cycle, leading to increased atmospheric CO2 levels and altering ecosystems' carbon absorption capacities, with soils serving as the largest carbon reservoirs in terrestrial ecosystems. The complexity and variability of soil properties, shaped by long-term transformations, make it crucial to study these properties at various spatial and temporal scales to develop effective climate change mitigation strategies. However, integrating disparate soil databases presents challenges due to the lack of standardized protocols, necessitating collaborative efforts to standardize data collection and processing to improve the reliability of Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) estimates. This issue is particularly relevant in peninsular Spain, where variations in sampling protocols and calculation methods have resulted in significant discrepancies in SOC concentration and stock estimates. This study aimed to improve the understanding of SOC storage and distribution in peninsular Spain by focusing on two specific goals: integrating and standardizing existing soil profile databases, and modeling SOC concentrations (SOCc) and stocks (SOCs) at different depths using an ensemble machine-learning approach. The research produced four high-resolution SOC maps for peninsular Spain, detailing SOCc and SOCs at depths of 0–30 cm, 30–100 cm and the effective soil depth, along with associated uncertainties. These maps provide valuable data for national soil carbon management and contribute to compiling Spain's National Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory Report. Additionally, the findings support global initiatives like the Global Soil Organic Carbon Map, aligning with international efforts to improve soil carbon assessments. The soil organic carbon concentration (g/kg) maps for the 0–30 cm and 30–100 cm standard depths, along with the soil organic carbon stock (tC/ha) maps for the 0–30 cm standard depth and the effective soil depth, including their associated uncertainties, —all at a 90-meter pixel resolution— (SOCM90) are freely available at https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/48edac6904eb1aff4c1223d970c050b4 (Durante et al., 2024)."

Zika;Taimoor Sohail,An optimal transformation method for inferring ocean tracer sources and sinks,"We describe a method to relate fluxes of heat and freshwater at the sea surface to the resulting distribution of seawater among categories such as warm and salty or cold and salty. The method exploits the laws that govern how heat and salt change when water mixes. The method will allow the climate community to improve estimates of how much heat the ocean is absorbing and how rainfall and evaporation are changing across the globe. 
 The geography of changes in the fluxes of heat, carbon, freshwater and other tracers at the sea surface is highly uncertain and is critical to our understanding of climate change and its impacts. We present a state estimation framework wherein prior estimates of boundary fluxes can be adjusted to make them consistent with the evolving ocean state. In this framework, we define a discrete set of ocean water masses distinguished by their geographical, thermodynamic and chemical properties for specific time periods. Ocean circulation then moves these water masses in geographic space. In phase space, geographically adjacent water masses are able to mix together, representing a convergence, and air–sea property fluxes move the water masses over time. We define an optimisation problem whose solution is constrained by the physically permissible bounds of changes in ocean circulation, air–sea fluxes and mixing. As a proof-of-concept implementation, we use data from a historical numerical climate model simulation with a closed heat and salinity budget. An inverse model solution is found for the evolution of temperature and salinity that is consistent with “true” air–sea heat and freshwater fluxes which are introduced as model priors. When biases are introduced into the prior fluxes, the inverse model finds a solution closer to the true fluxes. This framework, which we call the optimal transformation method, represents a modular, relatively computationally cost-effective, open-source and transparent state estimation tool that complements existing approaches."

We compare a single-column version of a weather model to observations with two different cloud schemes and find that both the dynamical environment and atmospheric aerosols are important for reproducing observations. 
 Supercooled liquid clouds are common at higher latitudes (especially over the Southern Ocean) and are critical for constraining climate projections. We take advantage of the Macquarie Island Cloud and Radiation Experiment (MICRE) to perform an analysis of observed and simulated cloud processes over the Southern Ocean in a region and season dominated by supercooled liquid clouds. Using a single-column version of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecast System (IFS), we compare two different cloud microphysical schemes to ground-based observations of cloud, precipitation, and radiation over a 2.5-month period (1 January–17 March 2017). Both schemes are able to reproduce aspects of the cloud and radiation observations during MICRE to within the uncertainty of the data when the thermodynamic profile is prescribed with relaxation.  There are differences in water mass and representation of reflectivity between the schemes. A sensitivity study of the cloud microphysics schemes, one a bulk one-moment scheme and the other a two-moment scheme with prediction of mass and number, indicates that several key processes create differences between the schemes. Surface radiative fluxes and total water path are highly sensitive to the formation and fall speed of precipitation. The prediction of hydrometeor number with the two-moment scheme yields a better comparison with observed reflectivity and radiative fluxes, despite predicting higher liquid water contents than observed. With the two-moment scheme, we are also able to test the sensitivity of the results to the input of liquid cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nuclei (IN). The cloud properties and resulting radiative effects are found to be sensitive to the CCN and IN concentrations. More CCN and IN increase liquid and ice water paths, respectively. Thus, both the dynamic environment and aerosols, integrated through the cloud microphysics, are important for properly representing Southern Ocean cloud radiative effects."

Photovoltaic power stations (PVPSs) on coastal tidal flats offer benefits, but the lack of information on the effects of PVPSs on benthic ecosystems and sediment carbon storage can hamper the development of eco-friendly renewable energy. We sampled the macrobenthos and sediment cores at a PVPS on a coastal tidal flat in eastern China. The biodiversity indicators and benthic ecological quality based on macrobenthos were mostly higher under the photovoltaic panels than elsewhere. These variations were primarily driven by pH, sediment grain size, and chlorophyll-a content. However, the PVPS had exerted a considerable influence on the macrobenthic community structure. Furthermore, the carbon stocks in the sediment cores from under the photovoltaic panels were similar to those in the reference sites. These results suggest that this PVPS has not had discernible short-term adverse effects on the benthic ecosystems or sediment carbon storage of the tidal flat. Nevertheless, the potentially long-term and cascading risks throughout the ecosystem warrant caution. Therefore, we recommend that policymakers adopt a cautious development strategy and implement long-term, high-frequency monitoring to ensure the sustainability of renewable energy production on coastal tidal flats."

The prevailing view attributes •OH formation to a nitrosyl intermediate derived from the hydrolysis of dichloramine, but this pathway is unlikely at neutral or acidic pH. This study reveals a novel mechanism where •OH is generated via interactions between trichloramine (NCl3) and dichloramine (NHCl2), which also form nitrosation agents. Our experiments demonstrated that the NCl3–NHCl2 interaction degrades micropollutants with kinetics 2–3 times faster than breakpoint chlorination. Using electron paramagnetic resonance, we detected •OH in the NCl3–NHCl2 reaction. Micropollutant removal was unimpaired under low dissolved oxygen (O2(aq)) conditions, aligning with negligible O2(aq) changes during the NCl3–NHCl2 reaction and suggesting O2(aq) does not participate in •OH formation. Using benzene as a probe in 18O-labeled H2O, we confirmed water contributes to the oxygen source of •OH in NCl3–NHCl2 interactions, through which parallel reactions occur, leading to the formation of one mole of •OH alongside 1.92 mol of N2.

Modeling estimates suggest that wildfire nearly doubled summertime Hg deposition within 10 km, despite advection of more than 75% of total emissions beyond Alaska.

This study reveals a novel reduction pathway in sediments that photosensitive DOM generates photoelectrons to stimulate diverse nonphototrophic microorganisms to reduce As(V). This microbial photoelectrophic As(V) reduction (PEAsR) was investigated using microcosm incubation, which showed the transfer of photoelectrons from DOM to indigenous sediment microorganisms, thereby leading to a 50% higher microbial reduction rate of As(V). The abundance of two marker genes for As(V) reduction, arrA and arsC, increased substantially, confirming the microbial nature of PEAsR rather than a photoelectrochemical process. Photoelectron ion is unlikely to stimulate photolithoautotrophic growth. Instead, diverse nonphototrophic genera, e.g., Cupriavidus, Sphingopyxis, Mycobacterium, and Bradyrhizobium, spanning 13 orders became enriched by 10–50 folds. Metagenomic binning revealed their genetic potential to mediate the photoelectron-assisted reduction of As(V). These microorganisms contain essential genes involved in respiratory As(V) reduction, detoxification As(V) reduction, dimethyl sulfoxide reductase family, c-type cytochromes, and multiple heavy-metal resistance but lack a complete photosynthesis system. The novel microbial PEAsR pathway offers new insights into the interaction between photoelectron utilization and nonphototrophic As(V)-reducing microorganisms, which may have profound implications for arsenic pollution transportation in mine stream sediment."

Yet, its potential risks or cobenefits for marine ecosystems are still mostly unknown, thus hampering its evaluation for large-scale application. Here, we assessed the impacts OAE may have on plankton communities, focusing on phytoplankton and microzooplankton. In a mesocosm study in the oligotrophic subtropical North Atlantic, we investigated the response of a natural plankton community to CO2-equilibrated OAE across a gradient from ambient alkalinity (2400 μmol kg–1) to double (4800 μmol kg–1). Abundance and biomass of phytoplankton and microzooplankton were insensitive to OAE across all size classes (pico, nano and micro), nutritional modes (autotrophic, mixotrophic and heterotrophic) and taxonomic groups (cyanobacteria, diatoms, haptophytes, dinoflagellates, and ciliates). Consequently, plankton communities under OAE maintained their natural chlorophyll a levels, size structure, taxonomic composition and biodiversity. These findings suggest a high tolerance of phytoplankton and microzooplankton to CO2-equilibrated OAE in the oligotrophic ocean. However, alternative application schemes involving more drastic perturbations in water chemistry and nutrient-rich ecosystems require further investigation. Nevertheless, our study on idealized OAE will help develop an environmentally safe operating space for this climate change mitigation solution."

The videos showed that fibrous MPs formed tangles through entanglement, which moved in an axial direction aligned with the flow streamline. Both fibrous and fragmental MPs showed suspended movement as well as surface movement (e.g., sliding, rolling, and saltating) in the porous media. Some deposited fibrous MPs showed flexible deformation due to shear flow. Compared to fragmental MPs, fibrous MPs showed lower mobility due to the tendency to deposit and clog the porous media. The mobility of fragmental MPs was enhanced in the presence of AEO but remained relatively unchanged with AES. In the presence of CTAC, the mobility of fragmental MPs was slightly inhibited under low ionic strength (IS) conditions but remarkably enhanced under high IS conditions. However, the mobility of fibrous MPs was largely unaffected by the surfactants.

The study revealed ubiquitous occurrence of bisperfluoromethane sulfonimide (bis-FMeSI) in dust from e-waste sites, surrounding regions (20–50 km distant from e-waste sites), and urban areas with the levels in a descending order along with the distance from the e-waste sites.

We measured the log reduction in airborne survival of bacteria, lipid peroxidation, and the activities of antioxidant enzymes and total antioxidants. The results show that bacterial inactivation by the simultaneous operation of both technologies was significantly greater than the sum of the inactivation values by individual treatments, demonstrating a synergistic disinfection effect. The Pearson correlation coefficient indicates a strong correlation between airborne bacterial survival and lipid peroxidation (r ≥ 0.83). Furthermore, 222 nm far-UVC was found to be able to inactivate the antioxidant defense in airborne bacteria. Our results together suggest that the simultaneous operation of 222 nm far-UVC and negative air ions induces oxidative stress while deactivating antioxidant defense, contributing to the observed synergistic disinfection effect.

Optimal heating for the first mode, characterized by a lower‐level anomalous anticyclone over northern Bay of Bengal (BOB), is distributed over the Arabian Sea and tropical eastern Indian Ocean (EIO)‐Maritime Continent, with cooling over the BOB‐western North Pacific. In contrast, heating over the tropical southwestern Indian Ocean and equatorial Atlantic, along with cooling over the tropical EIO‐western Pacific, optimally drives the second mode, featuring an anomalous anticyclone over central‐northern India. El Niño/Southern Oscillation indirectly influences SASM by triggering heat sources resembling these optimal patterns. Other sea surface temperatures (SSTs), like those over equatorial Atlantic, can also generate similar heating structures, causing corresponding SASM anomalies.

Reconstructing the provenance of sediment in Himalayan River systems can inform on stages in the tectonic history of the orogen. Here, we analyze the oxygen, carbon and “clumped” isotope compositions of carbonate minerals from Himalayan bedrock, Ganga River sediments and Bengal Fan turbidite deposits. We demonstrate that river sediments consist of a mixture of Himalayan‐derived and authigenic calcite precipitated in the river system. The relative abundance and clumped isotope apparent temperatures of detrital calcite in turbidite deposits decreased between the Late Miocene and Pliocene, while chemical weathering intensity did not increase during this interval. Considered together, these results reflect the establishment of the Lesser Himalaya as an important carbonate sediment source for Himalayan rivers, driven by the uplift and exhumation of this thrust sheet."

 The Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, a climate event 56 million years ago, was characterized by rapid carbon release and extensive ocean acidification. However, our understanding of acidification and the evolution of ocean saturation states continues to be hindered by considerable uncertainties, primarily stemming from the limited availability of proxy data. Under such conditions, data assimilation allows for an internally consistent assessment of atmospheric CO2 changes, ocean acidification and carbonate saturation state during this period. Here, we present a reconstruction of the Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum carbon cycle perturbation by assimilating seafloor sediment CaCO3 and sea surface temperature proxy data with simulations from an Earth system model, which includes a comprehensive carbonate system. Our reconstructions indicate a substantial increase in atmospheric CO2 from 890 ppm (95% credible interval: 680–1,170 ppm) to 1,980 ppm (1,680–2,280 ppm), coupled with a notable decline in pH (0.46 units, ranging from 0.31 to 0.63 units) and surface-water calcite saturation state, decreasing from 10.2 (7.5–12.8) in the pre-event period to 3.8 (2.8–5.1) during the thermal maximum. Carbonate undersaturation intensified substantially in high-latitude surface waters during the Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, paralleling the current decline in Arctic aragonite saturation driven by anthropogenic CO2 emissions.

Machine learning and network model analysis of Hi-C datasets across 62 2n genomes suggest that inter-chromosomal contacts demarcate genome topology along a spatial gradient of genome activity. 
 Non-homologous chromosomal contacts (NHCCs) between different chromosomes participate considerably in gene and genome regulation. Due to analytical challenges, NHCCs are currently considered as singular, stochastic events, and their extent and fundamental principles across cell types remain controversial. We develop a supervised and unsupervised learning algorithm, termed Signature, to call NHCCs in Hi-C datasets to advance our understanding of genome topology. Signature reveals 40,282 NHCCs and their properties across 62 Hi-C datasets of 53 diploid human cell types. Genomic regions of NHCCs are gene-dense, highly expressed, and harbor genes for cell-specific and sex-specific functions. Extensive inter-telomeric and inter-centromeric clustering occurs across cell types [Rabl’s configuration] and 61 NHCCs are consistently found at the nuclear speckles. These constitutive ‘anchor loci’ facilitate an axis of genome activity whilst cell-type-specific NHCCs act in discrete hubs. Our results suggest that non-random chromosome positioning is supported by constitutive NHCCs that shape genome topology along an off-centered spatial gradient of genome activity. The authors develop a supervised and unsupervised learning algorithm Signature.

 Individualized genetic therapies—medicines that precisely target a genetic variant that may only be found in a small number of individuals, as few as only one—offer promise for addressing unmet needs in genetic disease, but present unique challenges for trial design.

These results will facilitate the design of compact topological devices. 
 Topological pumps reveal topological insights of adiabatic mode evolution, in which adiabaticity plays a crucial role. However, the adiabatic infimum, i.e., the possible shortest evolution duration of an adiabatic topological pumping process, has remained elusive. In this study, we report the approach of adiabatic infimum in topological pumps in photonic waveguides based on the lithium niobate-on-insulator (LNOI) platform. Besides the most common way to achieve adiabaticity by slowing down the evolution of the system, the adiabaticity of a topological pump is also contingent on an effective Berry connection between instant eigenstates, which can be controlled by the selection of specific pump loops. Specifically, we develop a strategy to identify a pump loop with a minimized effective Berry connection, corresponding to the adiabatic infimum of a topological pump. As such, it is experimentally demonstrated that topological pumps can happen even with rapid evolution speed, at which the conventional pump would completely fail. The adiabatic infimum accelerates the topological pumps from the constraints of slow evolution and facilitates the design of compact topological devices.

 Data proliferation in the digital age necessitates robust encryption techniques to protect information privacy. Optical encryption leverages the multiple degrees of freedom inherent in light waves to encode information with parallel processing and enhanced security features. However, implementations of large-scale, high-security optical encryption have largely remained theoretical or limited to digital simulations due to hardware constraints, signal-to-noise ratio challenges, and precision fabrication of encoding elements. Here, we present an optical encryption platform utilizing scattering multiplexing ptychography, simultaneously enhancing security and throughput. Unlike optical encoders which rely on computer-generated randomness, our approach leverages the inherent complexity of light scattering as a natural unclonable function. This enables multi-dimensional encoding with superior randomness. Furthermore, the ptychographic configuration expands encryption throughput beyond hardware limitations through spatial multiplexing of different scatterer regions. We propose a hybrid decryption algorithm integrating model- and data-driven strategies, ensuring robust decryption against various sources of measurement noise and communication interference. We achieved optical encryption at a scale of ten-megapixel pixels with 1.23 µm resolution. Communication experiments validate the resilience of our decryption algorithm, yielding high-fidelity results even under extreme transmission conditions characterized by a 20% bit error rate.

 To address the challenge of limited training samples, this study employs the model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithm along with domain-knowledge-based data augmentation to predict winter temperatures on the Korean Peninsula. While data augmentation has been achieved by using global climate model simulations, the proposed augmentation is purely based on the observed data by defining the labels using large-scale climate variabilities associated with the Korean winter temperatures. The MAML-applied convolutional neural network (CNN) (referred to as the MAML model) demonstrates superior correlation skills for Korean temperature anomalies compared to a reference model (i.e., the CNN without MAML) and state-of-the-art dynamical forecast models across all target lead months during the boreal winter seasons.

 The alignment of clay minerals in sediments is of high importance for their mechanical and physical properties. The development of this alignment starts with the deposition of clay, its strength is measured by the crystallographic preferred orientation. So far, the early stages of sedimentation have been restricted to post-mortem observations. Here we present particle settling experiments in four dimensions (time and orientation, as a function of overburden and composition) observed in situ using synchrotron diffraction, in which kaolinite and kaolinite-illite mixtures were sedimented in water columns. The alignment strength in freshly settled sediments increases with overburden, but is higher in deionized water than in seawater. Alignment strength increases within the first few millimetres of overburden and stagnates afterwards. With illite added, the resulting alignment strength is substantially decreased. Our results demonstrate that electrostatic interactions between particles are overcome by gravitational forces already within the upper millimetres of sediment.

 Slow-slip events at global subduction zones relieve tectonic stress over days to years. Through slow-slip cycles, high fluid pressures observed at the top of subducting plates are thought to fluctuate, potentially due to the valving action of an impermeable layer near the plate interface. We model teleseismic scattering data at the Manawatu deep slow-slip patch at the Hikurangi margin in New Zealand and find high seismic P-to-S wave velocity ratios, VP/VS, in the upper ~5 km of the subducting Pacific Plate, reflecting sustained elevated fluid pressures that decrease during slow-slip and increase during inter-slow-slip periods. Within a ~ 3 km thick lower crustal layer of the overriding Australian Plate, decreasing VP/VS during inter-slow-slip periods reflects permeability reduction due to mineral precipitation. Increasing VP/VS during slow-slip reflects increasing permeability and crack density, facilitating upward fluid transfer through this layer. Our results suggest it acts as a valve to relieve high fluid pressures in the subducting slab.

 The response of European precipitation variability to climate change is still poorly understood. Here we present a high-resolution speleothem record of Eastern Central European (ECE) autumn/winter precipitation to study decadal to centennial hydroclimatic variations in the European-Atlantic sector since the Last Glacial Maximum. The Cloşani Cave δ18O record shows that the reorganization of the North Atlantic jet following the demise of the Northern Hemispheric ice sheets lasted until c. 6000 to 5000 years before present. Trace element-derived semi-quantitative autumn/winter precipitation amount reveals that the late Glacial and the early to mid-Holocene experienced about 20–30% higher precipitation than present. During the deglaciation, we detect an increased decadal to centennial precipitation variability decoupled from millennial-scale North Atlantic temperature changes. The findings suggest that dynamic (rather than thermodynamic) processes determine regional precipitation variability and the probability of extreme precipitation events in ECE, highlighting the importance of understanding such dynamics for future predictions.

 Many phytoplankton produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas. However, little is known about the relationship between their methane production and photosynthesis, which drives carbon sequestration in the oceans. Here, by ruling out the possibility of classical methanogenesis, we show that the bloom-forming marine microalga Emiliania huxleyi released methane during photosynthesis (did not generate it in darkness) while grown under different light levels, the amount of methane released correlated positively with photosynthetic electron transfer and carbon fixation. Under growth-saturating light, E. huxleyi produces methane at a maximal rate of about 6.6 ×10−11 μg cell−1 d−1 or 3.9 μg g−1 particulate organic carbon d−1. The microalga released up to 7 moles methane while fixing about 105 moles of carbon dioxide. Considering the higher global warming potential of methane than that of carbon dioxide and complicated processes involved in methane air-sea fluxes, the warming potential of phytoplankton methane production should be broadly evaluated.

Here we developed a composite sustainability index integrating societal benefits and environmental costs of aquaculture. The results show that two-fifths of the 161 countries achieved a high sustainability score (score > 50) in 2018, indicating a considerable need for improvement in the sustainability of aquaculture worldwide.

A. palmata microbiomes were correlated to reef and habitat and minimally to coral genet. Carysfort Reef exhibited the lowest survivorship which correlated to lower current velocity and a higher relative abundance of Rhodobacterales in A. palmata. Higher survivorship was present at Pickles Reef which correlated to the highest current velocity, and at North Dry Rocks with the shallowest outplant depth. Habitat factors driven by time of year such as higher levels of nitrate, nitrite, and temperature also correlated with a relative increase in a putative pathogen, Alteromonadales, and a decrease in an uncharacterized core bacteria.

 Land-surface reflectance (LSR) is a basic physical retrieval in terrestrial monitoring. The potential for high-frequency surface product estimation was evident in third-generation Geostationary Earth Orbit (3rd-GEO) satellites, substantially improving spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions. Intercomparisons with LSR products from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites have been employed as a common way to evaluate the LSRs of GEO satellites. However, in mid-latitude regions, comparing the LSR between two satellites is challenging due to constraints in the sun–target–sensor geometries. In this study, we proposed a method to obtain observations with consistent viewing and illumination conditions aligned with those of the Himawari-8/Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) at mid-latitudes, by utilizing forward and backward viewing cameras from LEO sensors, such as Terra/Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR). The reflectance intercomparison revealed that the estimated AHI LSR closely matched the LSR from MISR in the red and near-infrared (NIR) bands at latitudes higher than 30°N/S during 2018–2019, with correlation coefficient (r) greater than 0.8 and a relative root mean square error (RRMSE) below 25 %. The data accuracy in the NIR bands was higher than in the red band, as indicated by a lower RRMSE. The correlation was also stronger in non-forested regions compared to forested areas, with higher r values. Additionally, screening observation pairs based on the relative azimuth angle (RAA), which assumes rotational symmetry in LSR, was examined and proved effective for GEO–LEO intercomparisons. This RAA-matching criterion enables reflectance intercomparisons across a wide longitude range at mid-latitudes, including areas like mainland China and New Zealand, where ray-matching is not applicable. The reflectance consistency demonstrated by RAA matches was comparable to that of ray matches, although the RAA-matching is constrained by timing due to the solar location. The findings from this study have potential applications for other satellites."

 Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a promising tool to estimate gross primary production (GPP), but the retrieval of SIF is commonly noisy and highly sensitive to various interference factors. Particularly, the retrieval of SIF in the red band (RSIF) is more challenging than in the far-red SIF (FRSIF) due to the weaker fluorescence signal and the weaker absorption depth of oxygen at the red band compared with the far-red band. A comprehensive evaluation of all factors will allow a reproducible interpretation of SIF signals and advance the estimation of GPP from SIF. Recent studies have assessed the sensitivity of SIF retrieval to sensor characteristics, retrieval methods, and hardware specifications. However, none of these studies have systematically investigated the directional retrieval error of SIF resulting from the mismatch between irradiance measured above the canopy and the true irradiance reaching the canopy components viewed by a sensor. This study illustrated the effect of mismatched irradiance on the retrieval of RSIF using the commonly used standard 3FLD method based on SCOPE model simulations. The retrieval accuracy was highest in the hotspot direction, but it decreased as the observation direction was away from the hotspot. The relative root mean square error (RRMSE) was generally higher than 20 % in the forward directions. To reduce the retrieval error due to the mismatch effect, we proposed a modified 3FLD method (MFLD) by calculating the true irradiance reaching the canopy in a given direction based on geometric optical theory. The results showed that MFLD clearly improved the retrieval accuracy for RSIF, especially in the forward directions where RRMSE decreased by 10 % in most cases. For example, the RRMSE was reduced from 19.26 % to 5.50 % after mitigating the mismatch between the measured and actual solar irradiance, when the solar zenith angle was 40° and viewing zenith angle was 30° in the forward solar principal plane. Even at the nadir observation, the RRMSE was also reduced from 12.84 % to 5.64 %. In summary, MFLD can effectively mitigate the irradiance mismatch effect on the retrieval of RSIF. These results will improve our interpretation of the relationship between GPP and RSIF at different observation directions."

 Runoff variability in glacierized transboundary river basins over High Mountain Asia (HMA) directly affects the stability of water supply for more than one billion people in Asia. However, limited by insufficient in-situ gauges and imprecise hydrological model output, it is still a challenge to accurately monitor and comprehensively analyze the HMA runoff change. In this paper, we construct a water budget closure test of water balance equation based on satellite gravimetry constraints to assess the accuracy of hydrological dataset outputs, and propose a multi-dataset merging method to evaluate runoff variability in ten HMA transboundary basins over the past two decades. Results show that the runoff quantified by the hydrological dataset has relatively maximum uncertainty compared to precipitation and evapotranspiration. The performance of the reconstructed terrestrial water storage change (TWSC) from hydrological dataset varies with basins, and the maximum Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) value ranges from 0.31 to 0.94. Nevertheless, the current hydrological dataset struggles to accurately reconstruct the interannual and annual variability of TWSC, with the maximum cyclostationary NSE (NSEc) value ranging from −1.07 to 0.24. Runoff change in HMA exhibits both overall stability and regional climatic condition-related spatial heterogeneity. A significant downstream change-driven increase trend of runoff occurs in Indus Basin (0.2 ± 0.1 mm/mon/yr), while Brahmaputra Basin (−0.5 ± 0.4 mm/mon/yr) and Salween Basin (−0.4 ± 0.2 mm/mon/yr) show significant runoff decrease trends driven by upstream and downstream changes, respectively. Climate change has exacerbated the instability of runoff in the arid basins over northern HMA, leading to evident increase in annual amplitude. Furthermore, negative correlation is found between temperature and runoff at the interannual scale, especially in Ganges Basin (−19.73 ± 12.53 Gt/month per °C) and Mekong Basin (−17.46 ± 9.43 Gt/month per °C). Our multi-dataset merging methodology can improve the reliability of using global hydrological datasets to quantify runoff variability in poorly in-situ gauged regions, and may also be applicable to the evaluation of precipitation and evapotranspiration."

 Economic impact estimates of the initial lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic showed a significant reduction in economic activities globally. However, the succeeding impacts and their spatiotemporal distribution within countries remain unknown. Studies showed that nighttime light data (NTL) has effectively revealed the spatiotemporal dimensions of the economic effects of COVID-19. Thus, this study used NTL data to determine the medium-term regional monthly economic impacts of the pandemic in the Philippines in terms of the Economic Activity Reduction (EAR) index. We generated a spatial error model, regressing pre-pandemic NTL on mean temperature, maximum rainfall, and built-up area. This model explained 81.6% of the pre-pandemic NTL and was used to estimate the counterfactual NTL. We subtracted the actual from the counterfactual to compute the EAR. Then, the EAR was regressed on regional factors to determine which ones influence the impacts. Results showed uneven distribution of EAR across space and time. The EAR was generally higher in urban regions than in rural ones. Overall, more regions in the south had higher EAR. Temporally, the EAR showed a dynamic pattern, increasing in less urban regions and decreasing in highly urbanized regions.

The regression coefficient of NDVI retrieved using the proposed method is 0.95, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.021 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.010. Compared to the previous work on GNSS-R algal bloom detection with overall accuracy of 0.82, this work shows significant improvement in both accuracy and utility. The recovery of lake surface NDVI provides detailed insights into algal blooms, including quantifiable metrics such as the amount and spatial distribution, which are crucial for effective monitoring and management. Additionally, the recovered image textures exhibit high clarity and closely resemble the reference NDVI images. Experimental evaluation using simulated and actual cloud blocks indicates the model’s robustness to recover NDVI under varying cloud cover conditions. In summary, this study demonstrates the capability of GNSS-R aided by supplementary data for recovering missing NDVI values on lake surfaces when optical observations are absent for the first time."

 Quick and high-precision semantic segmentation from Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point clouds faces huge challenges such as large amounts of data, occlusion in complex scenes, and the high annotation cost associated with 3D point clouds. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel efficient and high-precision semantic segmentation method Mapping Considering Semantic Segmentation (MCSS) for MLS point clouds by leveraging the 2D-3D mapping relationship, which is not only without the need for labeling 3D samples but also complements missing information using multimodal data. According to the results of semantic segmentation on panoramic images by a neural network, a multi-frame mapping strategy and a local spatial similarity optimization method are proposed to project the panoramic image semantic predictions onto point clouds, thereby establishing coarse semantic information in the 3D domain. Then, a hierarchical geometric constraint model (HGCM) is designed to refine high-precision point cloud semantic segmentation. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effect and efficiency of our method in segmenting challenging large-scale MLS two datasets, achieving improvement by 16.8 % and 16.3 % compared with SPT. Furthermore, the proposed method takes an average of 8 s to process 1 million points and does not require annotation and training, surpassing previous methods in terms of efficiency."

 Highly destructive flood disasters have occurred frequently recently. Related to this, accurate mapping of flood areas is a necessary undertaking that helps to understand the temporal and spatial evolution patterns of floods. Thus, this paper proposes a novel, unsupervised multi-scale machine learning (ML) approach for urban flood mapping with SAR images from the perspective of information mining and fusion. Considering the complexity of surface objects in urban scenes, the proposed approach first extracts and fuses multiple types of features, such as polarization, pseudo-color, and spatial features, from pre-flood and post-flood SAR images to enhance distinguishability of water bodies. In particular, some new pseudo-color features are constructed here for SAR images through pseudo-color synthesis and color space transformation. On this basis, a flood probability map (FPM) is generated, and multi-scale superpixel segmentation is performed on it. Then, an ML-based unsupervised classification model assisted by uncertainty analysis based on the Gaussian mixture model is designed and implemented for flood mapping at different segmentation scales. Finally, guided by the minimum uncertainty, an adaptive fusion strategy of multi-scale information is proposed to integrate the flood mapping results at different scales for producing the final flood map. The proposed approach is unsupervised, and can minimize the mapping uncertainty to improve mapping accuracy and reliability. These characteristics of the proposed approach make it practical. The results of comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective and has certain advantages over existing methods, especially in reducing false detections and correctly identifying the categories of uncertain pixels in flood mapping. Furthermore, the experimental results also indicate that the pseudo-color features constructed here also help enhance flood mapping accuracy."

 PM2.5 affects air quality, therefore, understanding the mechanism of PM2.5 growth is essential to figure out mitigation measures. Hourly real-time concentrations of water-soluble inorganic ions (WSIIs), including anions and cations, in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) were measured in Baoji, northwest China. During the winter monitoring period, the concentrations of PM2.5 and most WSIIs exhibited similar trends. Mass proportions of SNA [i.e., sulfate (SO42−), nitrate (NO3−), ammonium (NH4+)] in PM2.5 gradually increased with air deterioration, while equivalent ratios of anions to cations also increased. The heterogeneous aqueous reactions and/or gas-phase homogeneous reactions promoted the formation of secondary inorganics, especially during the haze events. Rapid transformations of primary gaseous precursors to secondary pollutants could lead to the substantial formation of SO42− and NO3−. In terms of particle growth rate, the mass proportions of SNA in PM2.5 decreased from General Growth (GG) to Explosive Growth (EG) events. Furthermore, the particle growth rates did not coincide with the pollution levels, while it occurred most frequently during the Transition Period, instead of the Polluted Period. The diurnal variation of SNA at different PM2.5 growth rates has been discussed. The results of the Random Forest (RF) model showed that RH was an important factor for EG of PM2.5, while low RH was a reliable reason for the relatively low mass proportion of SNA. The results of this study could advance our understanding of particle growth and provide scientific evidence to support the establishment of unique air quality control measures under different pollution scenarios in Fenwei Plain, China."

 This study focuses on the validation of high-resolution regional reanalyses to understand their effectiveness in reproducing precipitation patterns over Italy, a climate change hotspot characterized by coastal sea-land interaction and complex orography. Nine reanalysis products were evaluated, with the ECMWF global reanalysis ERA5 serving as a benchmark. These included both European (COSMO-REA6, CERRA) and Italy-specific (BOLAM, MERIDA, MERIDA-HRES, MOLOCH, SPHERA, VHR-REA_IT) datasets, using different models and parametrizations. The inter-comparison involved determining the effective resolution of daily precipitation fields using wavelet techniques and assessing intense precipitation statistics through frequency distributions. In-situ observations and observational gridded datasets were used to independently validate reanalysis precipitation fields. The capability of reanalyses to depict daily precipitation patterns was assessed, highlighting a maximum radius of precipitation misplacement of about 15 km, with notably lower skills during summer. An overall overestimation of precipitation was identified in the reanalysis climatological fields over the Po Valley and the Alps, whereas multiple products showed an underestimation of precipitations across the North-West coast, the Apennines, and Southern Italy. Finally, a comparison with a time-consistent observational dataset (UniMi/ISAC-CNR) revealed a non-stable deviation from observations in the annual precipitation cumulate of the reanalysis products analyzed.
