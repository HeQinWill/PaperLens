To comprehensively assess PFAS contamination and overcome the challenge of unknown PFAS identification, we combined Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) and liquid chromatography─quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF MS) to identify novel and Legacy PFAS in archived bream liver samples collected in Germany between 1996 and 2020. By leveraging the ultrahigh resolution and mass accuracy of FT-ICR MS, we generated a mass list for cross-comparison with common precursor ion features from LC-QTOF MS. We identified 78 PFAS, including 68 classified into 12 homologue groups and 10 that did not fit into any homologue series, encompassing perfluoroalkyl acids, fluorotelomer-based substances, pentafluorosulfide perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids, polyfluoroalkyl sulfinates, polyfluoroalkyl sulfonyl sulfonamides, and other novel compounds including ionic liquids. Spatial and temporal analysis revealed that perfluoroalkyl phosphinic acids (C6/C6, C6/C8) and polyfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (n = 10) have a widespread presence, whereas tris(pentafluoroethyl)trifluorophosphate (FAP) and polyfluoroalkyl sulfonyl sulfonamides (n = 6) are more localized or have only recently emerged in specific regions. These findings underscore the need for continued monitoring to comprehensively understand exposure to PFAS and their long-term environmental impact."

Here, we investigated the CCF process, iron-bound organic carbon (Fe-OC), and chemoautotrophs through FeS-amended and in situ field samples in estuarine and coastal sediments. The CCF rates and Fe-OC concentrations were substantially enhanced by FeS addition and were significantly higher under anaerobic conditions than under aerobic conditions. Sulfide rather than Fe2+ facilitated CCF rates, while more Fe-OC formation was caused by Fe2+. More humic substances, aromatic protein, and high diffraction intensity in the presence of FeS indicated that iron oxides protect organic carbon against microbial degradation. The enhanced abundance of functional genes in relation to nitrification, sulfide, and iron oxidation, as well as cbbL and cbbM genes synchronously, favored the CCF process and Fe-OC formation. The CCF rates and Fe-OC concentrations were also higher in Fe2+─and sulfide-enriched field sediments, and a positive feedback relationship was observed between Fe-OC formation and the CCF process. These results highlighted that the chemoautotrophic process favors Fe-OC formation, in which the enhanced Fe-OC may restrain microbial degradation of organic carbon, thereby facilitating carbon retention and preservation. This preservation mechanism provided a robust pathway for carbon sequestration in estuarine and coastal wetlands, representing a negative climate warming feedback loop."

BMAA has gained much attention for its pathogenic link to Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. However, whether BMAA accumulates in diatoms under fluctuations in estuarine and coastal areas remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated BMAA biosynthesis in the model diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum under simulated conditions of fluctuating nitrogen and salinity in estuarine regions. BMAA was detectable in P. tricornutum under all simulated seawater or hyper-eutrophic conditions, although nitrogen source and salinity interactively impact BMAA accumulation. In addition, high-nitrogen wastewater conditions promoted carbon metabolism, including the Calvin cycle, glycolysis, fatty acid biosynthesis, and decreased nitrogen metabolism and BMAA production. Finally, we proposed and elucidated a complete biosynthetic pathway of BMAA originating from glutamate, incorporating catalysis by S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferases in diatoms, as inferred through artificial intelligence-based pathway analysis. This study marks the first attempt to decipher the BMAA metabolic pathway in diatoms, which provides a paradigm shift to identify conditions that trigger toxin production and also provides valuable metrics to address the complexity and unpredictability of monitoring and forecasting algal blooms."

However, the impact of complex exogenous DOM on soil microbial activity and C–Fe coupling in paddy soils remains underexplored. With a 100-day microcosm experiment, we found that biochar-DOM significantly promoted Fe reduction and accelerated CH4 and CO2 emissions, and manure-DOM increased soil CO2 emissions. These effects may be caused by the following mechanisms: DOM molecules with high aromaticity and high double bond equivalence (DBE), including lignins-polyphenols, lignins-polycyclic aromatics, and condensed aromatics-polycyclic aromatics, promoted soil Fe reduction and CH4 emissions with enrichment of soil Fe-reducing bacteria, r-strategists, and reduction of methanotrophs at the early stage of incubation. Conversely, DOM with low aromaticity, low DBE, and high H/C enhanced CO2 emissions with the enhancement of recalcitrant C degradation and CH4 oxidation at the late stage of incubation. In conclusion, our study highlights the importance of the molecular composition of organic amendment-derived DOM in regulating soil Fe reduction and greenhouse gas emissions. The findings offer novel insights into the effective utilization of agricultural resources and the potential mitigation of greenhouse gas production and emissions."

 Phytochromes are biliprotein photoreceptors widespread amongst microorganisms and ubiquitous in plants where they control developmental processes as diverse as germination, stem elongation and floral induction through the photoconversion of inactive Pr to the Pfr signalling state. Here we report crystal structures of the chromophore-binding module of soybean phytochrome A, including ~2.2 Å XFEL structures of Pr and Pfr at ambient temperature and high resolution cryogenic structures of Pr. In the Pfr structure, the chromophore is exposed to the medium, the D-ring remaining α-facial following the likely clockwise photoflip. The chromophore shifts within its pocket, while its propionate side chains, their partners as well as three neighbouring tyrosines shift radically. Helices near the chromophore show substantial shifts that might represent components of the light signal. These changes reflect those in bacteriophytochromes despite their quite different signalling mechanisms, implying that fundamental aspects of phytochrome photoactivation have been repurposed for photoregulation in the eukaryotic plant.

 Future changes in rainfall over India are critically important, given their impact on millions of people and the country’s agriculture. However, most studies focus only on changes up to the year 2100, leaving long-term projections largely unexplored. In this study, we leverage a 10-member ensemble with an Earth system model under relatively strong emissions to examine rainfall changes over India to 2500. Our results show a pronounced weakening of large-scale monsoon circulation after 2100, mainly due to increased atmospheric stability caused by rapid warming in the upper troposphere over land. At the same time, the Indian monsoon system expands significantly to the north and west. The northward expansion is driven by accelerated warming over the Tibetan Plateau, which pushes the low-level monsoonal winds and pressure systems further north. This, along with the development of a strong anomalous anticyclonic circulation over the Bay of Bengal, leads to more consistent upward motion over northern India and a northward expansion of the monsoon. Meanwhile, the westward expansion is linked to uneven warming in the Indian Ocean as the warm pool shifts westwards. These circulation changes, combined with the asymmetric warming pattern, enhance northward moisture transport and contribute to the intensification of rainfall across northwestern and northern India post-2100. These local expressions of large-scale perturbations provide a mechanistic framework for informing long-term mitigation and adaptation efforts for India."

 The coupling between the lithosphere and mantle dynamics is important for Earth’s tectonic movement and deformation. Plate driving forces changing from subduction to viscous flow drag can potentially explain the continuous plate convergence where subducting slabs are detached. However, tectonic expressions in different slab detachment scenarios are inconsistent and the role of mantle flow in plate convergence remains enigmatic. Through numerical modeling, we demonstrate that plate convergence can be caused by mantle flow induced by slab detachment and regulated by lithospheric mantle-ridge interaction. Spreading ridge-trench collision has minimal effects on the deformation of overriding plates, whereas continent-trench collision can lead to substantial tectonic uplift at suture zones. Mid-ocean ridges bounding incoming plates accelerate plate motion in ridge-trench collision scenarios and induce considerable tectonic uplift in continent-trench collision scenarios, as evidenced by the acceleration of the Farallon-Pacific ridge spreading and the rapid uplift of the Himalayas after slab detachment episodes.

 Earth’s crustal materials are recycled into the mantle through subduction, but the depth and nature of recycled components remain debated. Here we report copper (Cu) isotope evidence for the involvement of recycled crustal materials in a deep-mantle plume source. Permian mantle plume-derived picrites and basalts from the Emeishan large igneous province (Southwest China), excluding three hydrothermally altered outliers, exhibit δ65Cu values up to 0.65‰, obviously higher than typical mantle values (0.07 ± 0.10‰). The δ65Cu values show no correlation with loss-on-ignition (LOI), Mg#, ƐNd(t), Cu/Th, Cu/Pd, or redox state, ruling out magma differentiation or post-magmatic alteration. Instead, the elevated δ65Cu values most plausibly reflect recycled crustal sulfides with elevated δ65Cu value in the mantle source. These findings provide robust evidence for the recycling of Cu-rich sulfides into the deep mantle (potentially the lower mantle), elucidating the ultra-deep geochemical cycling of copper and sulfur within Earth’s interior.

 Oligo-Miocene strata in the northern North Sea comprise hundreds of enigmatic km-scale sand-cored mounds. We investigated these using a basin-scale 3D seismic dataset coupled with petrophysical logs and cuttings mineralogy for hundreds of wells. Here we document the discovery of ‘sinkites’, large-scale sand bodies that have sunk into and underpin low-density bio-silicious ooze rafts, violating the law of superposition. The stratigraphic inversion is attributed to buoyancy instabilities between km-scale rigid low density ooze rafts and liquefied, younger, denser, unconsolidated sand. The sand slurry dislodged the ooze as rafts, delimited by early-stage polygonal faults formed due to volumetric contraction of underlying ooze packages. Akin to load casts, but orders of magnitude bigger, ‘sinkites’ introduce a new large-scale gravitational process into geology. Their discovery and association to fractured low density ooze is important to stratigraphy and assessments of reservoir, seal and fluid flow in petroleum and CO2 storage projects and may have other implications.

 In September 2023, a spatially compounding event affected Europe, with an intense heatwave over northern France and nearly simultaneous extreme floods over the Iberian Peninsula and Greece. These extremes were accompanied by a low-high-low pressure system known as Omega pattern. However, the capability of climate models to reproduce such complex extremes and related atmospheric circulations is still unclear. By introducing a novel index, here we show that the 2023 event was not unique yet most extreme in recent decades. Using ensemble boosting, the fully-coupled Community Earth System Model 2 can reproduce such co-occurring extremes with remarkably similar configurations of the large-scale flow and even higher heatwave/rainfall than observed. This suggests that similar compounding events with even stronger intensity could, in principle, occur. However, such spatially compounding events are too rare in the model relative to reanalysis, suggesting that the model may underestimate their future occurrence in a warming climate.

Using rapid spectroscopic gas analysers, we observed consistent net foliar methane oxidation and nitrous oxide emission across all light conditions, demonstrating saturating light response patterns. Maximum flux rates were significantly more sensitive to soil conditions than carbon dioxide or water vapour exchange. Analysis revealed foliar methane and nitrous oxide fluxes overwhelmingly regulated by internal leaf processes like xylem transport, with modulation by external light intensity.

 Rapid and accurate monitoring of surface water is critical for water resource management, environmental protection, sustainable urban development, among other issues. Landsat and Sentinel data are publicly available optical data with high spatial and temporal resolution, providing the possibility for large-scale surface water mapping. However, traditional threshold-based or supervised classification-based surface water mapping methods often require adjusting thresholds or training samples for different areas or different sensors, which may hinder the generalization performance of the method in large-scale water body mapping. To address these difficulties, we propose an unsupervised cross-sensor deep learning water bodies mapping framework (UUCP) for unlabeled large-scale optical remote sensing images. The UUCP framework adopts an unsupervised multi-segment thresholding strategy to achieve the transition from label-free learning to noisy label learning. It learns robust multi-scale features of water bodies by the developed channel attention multi-scale surface water extraction network and training strategies under noisy labels. The proposed algorithm's effectiveness was evaluated using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images from Guangzhou and Wuhan in China, and nine regions in France. The results show that our proposed method performs well in the overall performance of water extraction and is applicable to different sensors, with Kappa values reaching an average of 0.8859 and 0.8084 on Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8, respectively. More importantly, in cross-sensor experiments (the model trained on Landsat-8 data directly predicts Sentinel-2 dataset), the UUCP algorithm has excellent performance and is superior to other traditional water extraction algorithms. Overall, UUCP has excellent generalization ability and provides a new perspective for large-scale surface water mapping."

 PAZ mission is an X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite launched by Spain in February 2018, capable of routinely acquiring images with high spatio-temporal resolution. In this paper, we explore the potential of spotlight-mode (HS) PAZ images for monitoring small-scale ground deformation with millimeter-level accuracy, utilizing 21 HS PAZ images acquired over the Alcoy basin (SE Spain) between September 2019 and February 2021. Phase unwrapping and long-wavelength atmospheric delays significantly impede high-accuracy estimation of small-scale ground deformation in the study area. To address these issues, we first propose an approach for correcting phase unwrapping errors in interferograms by incorporating constraints from both spatial and temporal domains. Subsequently, we propose a block-based correction algorithm based on principal component analysis (PCA) to mitigate long-wavelength errors in the interferograms. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively eliminate long-wavelength errors in interferograms after both traditional phase-based method and GACOS corrections, reducing the standard deviation of the interferograms by up to a maximum of 68.4 %, and a value of 37.7 % on average. External validations from GPS and topographic measurements confirm that the deformation time series derived from the proposed method show an accuracy higher than 3 mm. This means millimeter-level precision is achieved in small-scale ground deformation measurements using PAZ SAR images. The analysis of the ground deformation derived from PAZ images reveals 41 active deformation areas in the Alcoy basin between September 2019 and February 2021, each that exhibits a deformation rate exceeding 5 mm/year. Through independent component analysis (ICA) and k-means clustering, we identify three distinct temporal evolution patterns corresponding to landslide activities, land subsidence, and land settlements. This study serves as a methodological blueprint for high-accuracy ground deformation estimation using high-resolution PAZ imagery, offering valuable complementary data to conventional medium-resolution SAR systems (e.g., Sentinel-1) in ground deformation monitoring applications."

 Surface water monitoring is fundamental for managing water resources and sustaining life in arid regions worldwide. Egypt is an arid country in Northern Africa, and the surface water is critical for ecosystem health, agricultural production, and human livelihoods. During dry seasons, Egyptian water bodies exhibit unique challenges for remote sensing detection due to their significant spectral differences, complex morphological patterns, and numerous small streams. However, existing water detection methods face challenges in accurately identifying water bodies with high spatial and spectral variability, especially in arid regions during dry seasons. This paper proposes an improved U-Net model with multi-scale information and attention mechanism for precise surface water mapping by multispectral Sentinel-2 satellite images. The extraction accuracy can be improved by combining convolutional layers for local feature extraction with Vision Transformer using Manhattan self-attention for global context information. Our model attains optimal performance with IoU, F1-score, recall, and precision reaching 94.26%, 97.05%, 98.18%, and 95.94%, respectively, compared to traditional machine learning methods, particularly in challenging areas with small water bodies, complex backgrounds, and eutrophic water boundaries.

 The choice of transportation mode by residents significantly affects road traffic carbon emissions. Recent studies have explored the carbon reduction effects of green travel behaviors, such as bicycle-sharing and metro travel. However, there remains a gap in research estimating the carbon reduction potential associated with the transition from motorized transport to low-carbon alternatives. In this study, we propose a carbon emission reduction scenario simulation framework based on vehicle trajectory big data. This framework is designed to evaluate the impact of shifts in residential travel modes on carbon emissions at a fine spatial and temporal scale. Our analyses indicate that only 7.2 % of car trips are suitable for a shift to active transportation options, while over 64 % of trips qualify as multimodal, particularly involving e-bikes in combination with metro, which can result in annual carbon reductions of up to 3,138 tons. This highlights the importance of multimodal transport in reducing transportation-related carbon emissions. Regarding the spatial pattern, peripheral areas present substantial carbon reduction potential, accounting for nearly 50 % of the total. Moreover, significant carbon reduction potential exists in road sections connecting central and peripheral areas. In terms of timing, we observe two peaks in emission reductions on weekdays, occurring between 7–9 AM and 4–6 PM, with an additional peak on weekends around 9 PM. Ultimately, our research highlights that multimodal transportation, especially the combination of walking or conventional cycling with metro, may offer greater carbon reduction efficiency than relying solely on active transportation options. The findings of this study can significantly inform urban transportation policy-making and guide residents toward sustainable travel choices."

 Driven by artificial intelligence technologies, geospatial representation learning has become a new trend to better understand urban systems. Points of Interest (POI), as the current mainstream data in urban studies, plays an important role in these methods to discover urban characteristics. Existing studies on POI representation learning focus on spatial and type information, but overlook heterogeneous semantic interaction between POIs as well as hierarchical associations among types. To tackle these two problems, we propose a novel approach, called POI Dual Context Aware Neural Network (DCA) for learning POI representations by jointly embedding both spatial context and type context. For the spatial context of POIs, we introduce a distance decay effect constrained graph attention network as an encoder of DCA, which takes the heterogeneous semantic interaction and spatial proximity of POIs into account. For the type context of POIs, we propose a type hierarchical aggregation neural network architecture for DCA, and design a type infomax optimization objective following contrastive learning mechanism. The superiority of DCA is demonstrated in three geographic mapping tasks, including urban function mapping, region popularity mapping, and housing price mapping. This study provides a new insight to mine deep information from POIs, contributing to a better understanding of urban systems. The source code is released at http://github.com/quan-qin/DCA."

 Urban functional zones shape both the configuration of the physical environment and the ways individuals perceive and interact with urban spaces. However, the nonlinear associations between zone-specific objective features (e.g., greenery, traffic lights) and subjective perceptions (e.g., beauty and boredom) remain underexplored. This study proposes an analytical framework to investigate such associations in Beijing, China, by integrating street view images (SVIs), panoptic segmentation, and machine learning models. Specifically, we extracted nine objective features and six subjective perceptions from SVIs and modeled their nonlinear associations across different functional zones using 36 XGBoost models combined with SHAP analyses. Model performance was robust, with XGBoost achieving the highest average R2 (0.221) and one of the lowest average RMSE values (0.031) compared to four baseline machine learning models, underscoring its generalizability across perception dimensions and functional zone types. The results reveal three key findings. First, road users and safety barriers consistently ranked among the top contributors to subjective perceptions across all functional zones, while elements like traffic signs exhibited zone-specific effects. Second, the nonlinear associations exhibited varying threshold effects across functional zones, highlighting the context-dependent influence of environmental factors; for example, greenery visibility reduced safety perception in residential zones but enhanced it in commercial zones. Third, typical nonlinear patterns, including V-shaped and threshold effects, were observed, reflecting phenomena such as sensory saturation and diminishing marginal utility. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics between urban form and human perception, offering insights for adaptive, human-centric urban design strategies."

This paper mainly focuses on soil moisture change and surface erosion caused by rainfall in arid areas, and uses remote sensing technologies (such as InSAR and multi-spectral images) for monitoring and assessment. Although satellite observation data is used, its focus is on surface processes rather than the atmospheric environment, so it is not directly related to atmospheric environmental remote sensing technology (such as air quality monitoring, atmospheric composition analysis, etc.).",[],Jonathan C.L.

 Soil moisture change and surface erosion provide unique insight into the evolution of desert ecohydrology and geomorphology in hyper-arid areas under increasing hydroclimatic extremes. However, the spatial and temporal distributions of the transitional changes in soil moisture and surface erosion associated with sparse rainstorm events are not yet well-characterized due to the low spatial resolution (a few kilometers) of the current microwave radiometer and scarce temporal acquisition and SAR orbital observations, respectively. To address this deficiency, we apply three processing techniques to monitor these changes at a spatial resolution of 45–105 m and with a limited dataset covering four precipitation events of different magnitudes over the hyper-arid Qatar peninsula from 2017 to 2019. Two of the techniques are based on radar interferometric coherence using Sentinel-1C-band satellite data, as the investigated rainstorm events generate measurable isolated changes in the time-series coherence associated with variations in transient soil moisture and surface erosion. The third technique employs soil moisture indices derived from Sentinel-2 multi-spectral satellite imagery. Our observations indicate that the timing of satellite acquisitions relative to a rainstorm is the primary factor in selecting the appropriate technique for identifying soil moisture change, surface erosion, or both. As a result, we integrate these three techniques into a decision-tree to guide users in their methodological choices. Moreover, this decision-tree approach can further improve the assessment of erosion hotspots, flood risks and ecohydrological and geomorphological changes of deserts caused by the current fluctuations in rainstorm events over hyper-arid areas due to hydroclimate volatility."

 A systematic, long-term analysis of county-level UVR in Xizang is conducted by integrating satellite data from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 (GOME-2) with ground-based observations spanning 1961–2022. The spatiotemporal characteristics and influencing factors of parameters such as UV index (UVI), UVB, and UVA are analyzed. During 2005–2022, UVA, spectral irradiances (I310:310 nm, I324:324 nm and I380:380 nm) show significant upward trends, with Sen's slope values all exceeding 0.51. The mean values of Erythemal Daily Dose, UVA, and UVB in each county of Xizang are respectively 24.85–37.79, 3.32–5.10, 903–1330 (kJ/m2), with high values distributed in the areas of Shigatse, Lhasa, and southern Shannan. The population-weighted UVI across all counties exceeds 8.65, with 84.27 % of the population classified as experiencing “Extreme” UV exposure according to the WHO's UVI classification. The percentage of UVR in surface solar radiation is higher in the west and lower in the east, peaking in summer and dipping in winter, while the UVA/UVB ratio exhibits the opposite seasonal trend, increasing exponentially from summer to winter. UVR has higher coefficient of variation in the afternoon and more fluctuating peak times in summer with a higher risk of extreme values. Spatial multiple regression analysis (p < 0.001) indicates that UVR is significantly influenced by elevation and SA (positive effects), and by ozone total column (OTC), cloud optical thickness (COT), aerosol index (AI), and latitude (negative effects), with the model performing best in autumn and for the shorter wavelength band (I305). Temporally, COT and OTC show positively synchronous variation with UVR, while SA and AI show negative.

 This study investigated the complex relationships between aerosols, clouds, and solar radiation over the Korean Peninsula using long-term observational data from 1994 to 2023. We identified a negative correlation between PM10 concentration and solar radiation, indicating that aerosol levels significantly affect solar energy availability. Using the WRF-CMAQ coupled model, we quantitatively analyzed the contributions of aerosol direct effect (ADE) and cloud radiative effect (CRE), focusing on the differing impacts of stratus and cumulus clouds. Our findings reveal that stratus clouds, which are prevalent in the early morning, contribute substantially to ADE, while cumulus clouds, which develop in the afternoon owing to increased surface heating, primarily influence CRE. The Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) showed the highest contributions from both ADE and CRE, indicating that areas with a high population density and elevated aerosol concentrations (PM10, PM2.5, and AOD) experienced a pronounced impact of ADE on solar radiation. Conversely, in the Gangwon (GW) region, where mountainous terrain promotes cumulus cloud development, the afternoon contributions of CRE are more pronounced.
