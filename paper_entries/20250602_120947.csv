10.5194/essd-17-2249-2025,False,Earth System Science Data,该论文主要关注的是由闪电引发的北方森林野火的分布和特征，建立了一个名为BoLtFire的数据库。该数据库记录了2012年至2022年整个北方森林中超过200公顷的火灾信息，包括欧亚大陆和北美洲的火灾数据。论文提出了一种新的方法来匹配闪电和野火，旨在为了更好地模拟北方野火的起火和蔓延动态，并深入了解闪电驱动的火灾活动。虽然火灾会影响大气环境，但该研究并没有直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,[],Brittany Engle;Ivan Bratoev;Morgan A. Crowley;Yanan Zhu;Cornelius Senf,Distribution and characteristics of lightning-ignited wildfires in boreal forests – the BoLtFire database,"The pan-boreal lightning-ignited wildfire (BoLtFire) dataset spans the entire boreal forest from 2012 to 2022, focusing on fires of at least 200 ha. Developed using a new methodology to match lightning to wildfires in the boreal region, it includes 6902 fires – 4201 in Eurasia and 2701 in North America. BoLtFire provides new opportunities to model the ignition and spread dynamics of boreal wildfires and offers deeper insights into lightning-driven fire activity globally. 
 The frequency and severity of fire weather have been projected to increase under climate change, particularly in high-latitude boreal forests. Lightning, a key ignition source globally, is also expected to become more frequent with climate change and could significantly increase burn area. Current research on lightning-ignited wildfire (LIWs) has a long history in boreal ecosystems but has typically focused on North America due to better data availability, while the lack of publicly available data for Eurasia has hindered our comprehensive understanding of important characteristics of LIWs, such as holdover time, lightning ignition efficiency, frequency, and spatial distribution in boreal forests. This study introduces the temporal minimum distance (TMin) method, a novel approach to matching lightning strikes with wildfires without requiring ignition location that outperformed current methodologies. As a result, we developed a comprehensive dataset of lightning-ignited wildfires across the entire boreal forest from 2012 to 2022, encompassing 6902 fires, 4201 in Eurasia and 2701 in North America, each over 200 ha in size. This dataset (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14940326, Engle et al., 2024) provides new opportunities to model the ignition and spread dynamics of boreal wildfires and offers deeper insights into lightning-driven fire activity globally."
10.1029/2024GL113393,False,Geophysical Research Letters,这篇论文主要研究了地球系统模型中多年代际的温度变化，重点分析了北大西洋和全球温度的频谱特征，以及火山活动对温度的影响。研究发现，北大西洋和全球温度的高频谱密度与火山活动高峰期同时出现，表明这些变化主要受外部强迫驱动。论文还探讨了大西洋多年代际变率（AMV），但没有发现由内部因素产生且随时间持续的信号。总之，该研究侧重于气候模型和自然气候变率，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关联。,"['climate modeling', 'temperature variability', 'volcanic forcing', 'Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV)', 'North Atlantic', 'North Pacific']",Alejandro Fernandez;Byron A.

We find high spectral density in North Atlantic (NA) and global temperature that is concurrent with periods of high volcanic activity, suggesting a forced origin. There is no evidence in the ensemble of an internally‐generated and time‐persistent signal for Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV), the dominant mode on those timescales. The spatial patterns of low‐frequency variability indicate activity throughout the North Pacific, where signals persist to a greater extent after the forced signal is removed, in contrast with the NA where only the subpolar region associated with deep water formation is active. Subtropical and tropical NA regions are strongly associated with forced responses, suggesting the canonical AMV pattern is comprised of both internal and forced components, with the latter being the main driver."

This assessment, however, aggregates different length scales of the waves, thus not accounting for possible different wave responses over various scales. Here, by separating large and small scales, we find that throughout the mid‐latitudes large‐scale boreal winter transient atmospheric waves are projected to intensify and emerge from the internal variability over the 21st century. In North America, the North Atlantic and the North Pacific, it is the projected weakening of small‐scale waves that obscures the emergence of the waves when pooling together all scales. Our analysis further suggests that the region‐dependent changes in transient atmospheric waves are linked to the regional Arctic warming patterns."

Our findings show that under mean conditions, anthropogenic heat behaves similarly to a passive scalar, making planetary boundary layer height, wind speed, and urban surface area effective proxies for estimating additional warming.

A Gaussian mixing model is employed to simulate this process, considering the correlation between temperature and water vapor. Cloud droplet size distributions from aircraft measurements show a persistent and prominent mode of small droplets at 9 μ ${\upmu }$m, and the size of this mode compares favorably with predictions from the model. The results suggests that isobaric mixing plausibly contributes to the formation of clouds, particularly those observed at multiple altitudes with narrow droplet size distributions.

However, these models exhibit a persistent annual‐mean double‐ITCZ bias in preindustrial and historical simulations, casting doubt on their projections. Indeed, models with the smallest preexisting double‐ITCZ bias—aside from a few outliers—typically show the least enhancement of the double‐ITCZ feature under global warming. To investigate this further, we use CESM2 and conduct flux‐adjusted simulations that nearly eliminate the precipitation bias in preindustrial experiments, followed by CO2‐doubling simulations. Our bias‐reduced simulations show a much smaller reduction in the precipitation asymmetry index and only half the increase in rainfall in the southeastern Pacific compared to the original model. We conclude that climate models likely overestimate the enhanced double‐ITCZ feature under global warming due to the preexisting precipitation bias."

The response of cloud droplet spectral relative dispersion (ε) to aerosol number concentration (Na) as well as the role of turbulence in this response are yet puzzling. This study uses large eddy simulation to examine the ε–Na relationship and derives an expression for ε from a minimal model to elucidate this relationship. Our findings indicate that as Na increases, ε initially decreases because aerosols weaken turbulence‐induced broadening more than condensational narrowing. However, as Na continues to rise, ε increases as aerosols weaken condensational narrowing more significantly than turbulence‐induced broadening. These findings improve the understanding of the aerosol effects on cloud DSD and address the challenge of quantifying aerosol indirect effects considering turbulence, potentially leading to new cloud microphysics parameterizations."

For a steady climate, a constant and uniform rock uplift, a homogeneous bedrock, and a stream‐power erosion rule, the theory reproduces the known logarithmic longitudinal profile of steady‐state bedrock rivers. For steady‐state mountain glaciers, it predicts a Gaussian surface‐elevation distribution, which matches 1‐d simulation results. Our theory implies that changes in relief due to given changes in climate or tectonic forcing are stronger in purely fluvial landscapes, compared to purely glacial ones.

This distribution complicates accurate predictions of CCN activities. The size distribution of BCc particles remains approximately unchanged as they continuously undergo both growth and deposition, forming a steady state. Based on this, we develop a droplet activation parameterization to predict the number distribution of BCc particles with respect to hygroscopicity and dry particle diameter. The predicted results demonstrate good agreement with those directly obtained from observations and simulations. This study evaluates the BC activation behavior accurately by using a few parameters, facilitating improved assessment of BC's indirect radiative effects in large‐scale models."

 Biomass burning (BB) has a major impact on air quality and population health, with the brown carbon (BrC) of special concern as an important source of pollution and absorbing incoming radiation. The impact of BB was quantified in an urban area of Moscow, the northern gas-fuel heated European megacity, during warm and cold seasons. Real-time measurements of aerosol optical properties were performed by an aethalometer. Heating and non-heating periods are marked by Absorption Angstrom exponent (AAE) equal 1.1 and 1.2, spring agricultural and summer wildfires by 1.3 and 1.4, respectively. Light absorption babs of 10 ± 9 Mm−1 at 880 nm and 29 ± 27 Mm−1 at 370 nm was independent on heating activity. No significant seasonal difference was revealed by mass absorption coefficient for black carbon (BC) of 13.5 m2 g−1 and BrC of 0.9 m2 g−1. BC contribution to total absorption dominated in all wavelength ranges and seasons. During heating period, BrC contribution to total absorption at 370 nm (%babsBrC) was 16 ± 21 %, lower than in other European and Asian megacities where populations widely burn biomass and coal. It was 24 ± 31 % in spring due to agricultural fire impact and increased BB activity because of the population migration out of the city during the May holiday. Ryazan wildfire plumes affected Moscow, with babs(880) and babs(370) increase 1.7 and 2.4 times, respectively, with a high %babsBrC of 37 ± 59 %, and strong BrC absorption capacity in both day and nighttime. The relative absorption forcing of BrC compared to BC was estimated to range between 36.2 ± 1.1 % and 29.8 ± 2.7 % in ultraviolet and visible radiation range, respectively. Backward trajectory cluster and concentration weighted trajectory analyses revealed the regional origin of BB sources, coinciding with areas of observed wildfires. Collocated 12 h sampling and chemical composition analyses of BB tracers (levoglucosan and K+) identified the emission sources by significant correlations with BrC absorption. Four factors of BrC apportionment were identified via positive matrix factorization, showing contributions from fossil fuel combustion and secondary organic (82 %), and BB (18 %). As a result, regional population activity and spring and summer wildfires highlighted the uniqueness of Moscow as the northern gas-fuel heated megacity for BB impact studies in Europe and Asia."

 The eruption of the underwater volcano Hunga Tonga – Hunga Ha'apai (20.54° S, 178.3° W) on January 15, 2022, resulted in the first significant increase in the stratospheric water vapor content in the entire satellite observation era. This affects the radiation balance of the atmosphere, as well as its composition, including the ozone layer. In particular, in the winter stratospheric polar vortex, an increase in the water vapor concentration can lead to an increase in the threshold temperatures for the formation and surface area of polar stratospheric clouds (PSC), and, as a result, to stronger ozone destruction. Based on the M2-SCREAM reanalysis data, variations in ozone and ozone-active components were calculated for an ensemble of trajectories inside the polar vortex at altitudes of 17–22 km in the austral winter of 2023 and in the northern winter of 2023–2024 under conditions of increased water vapor content, as well as some previous winter seasons. Our calculations showed that ozone losses in Antarctica in 2023 did not increase compared to the winter of 2020 with the similar strong stratospheric polar vortex. One of the possible reasons could be the removal of excess water vapor due to condensation and subsequent sedimentation of large ice particles formed at the beginning of winter. In addition, in the Antarctic polar vortex for the considered winter seasons, chlorine reservoirs were almost completely transformed into the active form, and the increase in the surface area of the polar stratospheric clouds would not lead to additional release of active halogens and an increase in ozone depletion. In the Arctic increased water vapor in the early winter of 2023–2024 did not lead to significant ozone losses due to temperature increases caused by the minor sudden stratospheric warmings (SSW) in early January and two major SSWs in mid-January and early March 2024, and, as a result, to the continued warm polar stratosphere until the late winter season."

 This study investigates the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) heat budget over the urban and rural areas in Beijing during a heat wave (HW) event in Jun 2020, using potential temperature tendency outputs from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Validations against observational and reanalysis data show that the WRF model effectively captured the HW event and the urban heat island (UHI) effect, and well simulated variations in ABL temperatures and winds. It is found that the turbulent diffusion primarily contributes to the daytime ABL warming, while the larger-scale advection dominates in the nighttime ABL cooling. Both the daytime turbulent diffusion and the nighttime large-scale advection are generally stronger in the urban region than in the rural region. Besides, the radiation effect also plays a significant role in the daytime ABL warming especially in the rural area. Under HW conditions, the daytime warming effect of turbulent diffusion is notably amplified, while at night, the large-scale advection cooling is substantially weakened, and the turbulent diffusion intensifies to become the dominant term, particularly in the rural area. Surface sensible heat flux responds differently to the HW event compared to the turbulent diffusion term, as the latter also includes other turbulent processes like entrainment and latent heat flux. The large-scale advection term closely matches the horizontal temperature advection, indicating that the large-scale subsidence could be negligible in the ABL heat budget compared to horizontal advection over complex urban-rural terrain."

 Satellite Precipitation Products (SPPs) provide near real-time precipitation estimates on a global scale at finer spatial resolutions, facilitating data over remote and inaccessible regions. Despite the efficiency in data acquisition, the potential application of SPPs to weather monitoring, environmental surveillance, and disaster response is still challenging due to systematic and random errors. This paper proposed different bias correction techniques assimilating the inherent attributes of Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) matching, wavelet decomposition, Copula and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) known as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Daily precipitation over 10 temporally coherent clusters in South Peninsular India (SPI), estimated by four multisatellite products such as CMORPH, IMERG-E, IMERG-L and IMERG-F were bias corrected with high-resolution reanalysis dataset known as IMDAA from 2001 to 2020. A statistical analysis of before-corrected SPPs displayed an overestimation of 200 % by IMERG products in most of the clusters and underestimation of around 50 % by CMORPH. Post bias-corrected SPPs portrayed a significant reduction in bias to an average of 5 % and root mean square error of 12 mm/day declined to 1.5 mm/day on average across clusters and methods. Furthermore, most of the methods have closely captured the distribution behaviour including wet and dry periods and extremes of the observations. The results also indicated that the performance of bias correction techniques vary depending on the elevation, terrain features and seasonal patterns within a cluster. This highlights the need to adopt cluster-specific bias correction approaches for local climatological and topographical conditions. Such tailored corrections can enhance the reliability of bias-adjusted data for hydrological applications in these regions."
