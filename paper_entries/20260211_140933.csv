Two of the principal goals of the IRA were to onshore clean energy manufacturing and to make supply chains more resilient to geopolitical shocks. This article presents data for the solar and battery supply chains to assess what progress had been made toward these goals before the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act called many IRA provisions into question. The results reveal significant successes, but also persistent challenges, in building these supply chains. While the U.S. was slated to produce 61% of expected solar module demand in 2025, it would have produced only 37% of the cells and 11% of the ingots and wafers needed for those modules. In batteries, the U.S. could have realistically produced 100% of expected cell demand in 2025, but announced projects accounted for only 47% of the cathode, 23% of the anode, and 24% of the precursors. U.S. supply would have slightly increased as a percent of expected demand in 2030, but the situation would have remained broadly the same. There are four implications of the analysis. First, it demonstrates the difficulties of onshoring, especially in upstream components. Second, it shows that expected U.S. production would have, rather than exclude other countries, created global demand-pull. Third, it reveals that Biden’s tariffs would have likely increased the cost of U.S.-made panels and cells. We propose an alternative policy instrument."

To move towards decarbonization goals while maintaining a just transition in the electricity sector, we assess the regional employment implications in 2035 of two policy ambitions, the ‘Fit for 55’ package of the European Union (EU) and a hypothetical EU-wide coal phaseout. We account for changes in employment and associated skills covering the whole supply chain from resource extraction to decommissioning, including electricity generation, storage, and transmission. Employment transfers are distinguished from employment gains to identify skill needs at a NUTS 2 regional scale. We find that net employment creation is higher and more evenly distributed under the ‘Fit for 55’ policy plan compared to the hypothetical EU coal phaseout. Under both policy scenarios, the skill requirements for the workers in transition (many of whom are transferring from fossil fuel technologies to low-carbon technologies) depend on the specific region, while the skill sets needed for employment gains are similar across all European regions as they are driven by employment growth in technologies that require similar skills (wind and solar power). This information can support the design of re-skilling programs, helping to ensure that regions are not left behind in the energy transition."

Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) directly traces photosynthetic activity and offers a promising alternative, yet its mechanistic integration into yield models is still limited. In this study, given that the two different photosynthesis pathways C3 and C4 differ greatly in their environmental requirements, we apply this framework to estimate crop yield for two crops (C3: winter wheat and C4: summer maize) in the North China Plain. This framework is based on the mechanistic light reactions (MLRs) model utilizing remotely sensed SIF as a major input. The performance of the model was rigorously evaluated against official statistical yield records. Results indicate that from 2019 to 2022, both SIF and gross primary productivity (GPP) exhibited consistent and synchronous seasonal cycles, with clearly distinguishable dual-growing seasons corresponding to winter wheat and summer maize. Significant linear correlations between GPP and SIF were observed for both C3 and C4 crops, with stronger associations evident in C4 species. In addition, the strength of the SIF-yield relationship varied across phenological stages, and the cumulative SIF over the entire growth period (SIFtotal) demonstrated the strongest correlation with yield. The MLR-SIF model achieved robust estimation accuracy for both crops (C3: R2 = 0.6195, MAE = 0.6802 ton ha−1, RMSE = 0.8301 ton ha−1; C4: R2 = 0.6093, MAE = 0.6054 ton ha−1, RMSE = 0.7483 ton ha−1). Our methods and results are suitable for operational applications of crop yield monitoring at regional scales, offering a novel satellite-based approach for agricultural monitoring and providing scientific support for crop management, policy decisions and regional/global food security."

Yet, how national plans align with EU-wide ambition, alongside the implications for investment, infrastructure, and power-system operation, remain insufficiently assessed. We address this gap by linking an EU-specific implementation of a prominent integrated assessment model with Member State-level disaggregation (GCAM-Europe) with a higher-resolution European electricity system model (EXPANSE). This modelling framework captures national heterogeneity, sectoral detail, and spatiotemporal variability in electricity demand, renewable supply, and storage, enabling the assessment of grid investments and infrastructure. We analyse four scenarios representing EU-wide (Fit-for-55) or national (NECP) targets, implemented through explicit policies (POLICY) or cost-optimal carbon caps (COST_OPTIMAL). Results show all scenarios achieve the −55% fossil CO2 reduction by 2030, with the electricity sector driving the largest chunk. Renewable energy nearly doubles, with POLICY scenarios accelerating electrification and heat pump deployment, while COST_OPTIMAL scenarios leaning more on biofuels. Efficiency targets are partially met, with POLICY scenarios distributing savings more evenly across Member States compared to concentrated reductions of COST_OPTIMAL scenarios. By 2035, power system transformation diverges strongly: COST_OPTIMAL scenarios expand ~1250 GW of new capacity, concentrated in few resource-rich regions, while POLICY scenarios reach ~1750 GW with broader spatial distribution, requiring higher investments in renewables and grids. Average wholesale electricity prices are higher and more heterogeneous under POLICY scenarios, reflecting carbon costs, transmission bottlenecks, and reliance on fossil backup. Results highlight trade-offs between economic efficiency and equitable burden-sharing, underscoring the importance of coordinated EU governance, infrastructure planning, and complementary policies to balance cost-effectiveness with political feasibility and social acceptance."

However, uncertainties remain in how ET responds to tree cover (TC) change in Earth system models (ESMs), primarily due to the lack of large-scale observational constraints. Here, we synthesize flux tower measurements and satellite observations to quantify the sensitivity of ET to tropical TC change (∂ET/∂TC) under controlled climate conditions. Using both climate-bin regressions and space-time analogy approaches, we find a robust and significantly positive impact of TC on ET across multiple datasets and approaches, with an average sensitivity of ∼11.06 mm yr−1 per 1% change in TC. This sensitivity exhibits pronounced climate dependence, with ∂ET/∂TC amplified in arid and semi-arid regions, where additional TC enhances transpiration efficiency, but attenuated in humid regions as canopy–atmosphere decoupling limits energy exchange. These findings provide the first large-scale, observation-based quantification of ET sensitivity to TC change and establish an empirical benchmark for improving ESM representations of land–atmosphere feedbacks and predicting tropical forest resilience under the climate change."

A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) is one of the principal policies suggested to minimize these impacts. This study examines the implications of CBAM for the global iron and steel industry using a modified version of the Global change analysis model (GCAM). We introduce an expanded steel sector representation and a differentiated trade market to assess the impacts of CBAM implementation across OECD and non-OECD regions under deep decarbonization scenarios. Additionally, we explore the role of free emissions allowances, export rebates, and green subsidies in modifying CBAM outcomes. Our findings indicate that CBAM can reduce emissions leakage and incentivize the adoption of low-carbon steel technologies but may disadvantage exporters in regions implementing CBAM, leading to a net-loss of production in CBAM regions. This study contributes to the literature by modelling CBAM in an integrated assessment framework and providing insights for policymakers balancing climate action and economic competitiveness."

While anticipating job losses is crucial for designing effective policy responses, we examine the future of coal workers across time and geographies in China and India under mitigation scenarios. We focus on mine workers who have been less studied, outnumber those in coal power plants, and are more geographically concentrated. Our approach enriches the results of an integrated assessment model by incorporating mine-level data and coupling with a novel module for demographic and labour mobility to understand how concentrated vulnerabilities challenge the transition. A decline in coal jobs is inevitable in China due to continued mining productivity increase. The potential employment reduces by 41% in the next decade even under current climate policies. On the other hand, India faces a critical crossroads as projected mining production growth surpasses productivity increases. Beyond national climate ambitions, differences in mining productivity, local economic diversification, labour concentration, and employment patterns drive subnational disparities in vulnerability to accelerated mitigation. Notably, Shanxi and Jharkhand, the main mining regions for each country, account for a third of the 1.2 million workers who may struggle to transition to other sectors in the next decade under ambitious emissions mitigation. Although they are less exposed with a smaller mining workforce, the challenges for unproductive regions such as West Bengal or Shandong are even more urgent. Our findings provide quantitative insights to guide just transition policies, emphasising the need for targeted support, including transitional assistance and economic diversification, in the most affected coal-producing regions."

The impact of this trend on forest vegetation is still poorly understood, especially in areas not commonly subject to recurrent fires, i.e. in areas where tree species may not be adapted to fire and where flammability may increase as warming decreases moisture. Here we use recent advances in remote sensing to simulate burned area development until the end of the century under different climate scenarios. We then combine these projections with an European forest resources model to assess the impact of projected fire regimes on forests in three major biomes in Europe (i.e. Mediterranean, temperate and boreal forests, here represented by three countries: Spain, Germany and Sweden). Burned area was projected to increase in all regions in the 21st century, with the biggest increase and highest absolute damage in the Mediterranean region under the most severe climate scenario. Furthermore, we found that future fire disproportionately affects temperate forests, where a higher level of damage occurs for the same relative increase in burned area, compared to the other biomes. This was mostly due to the combination of increasingly favourable weather conditions for fire and large standing biomass, which drove the increased susceptibility of temperate regions to emerging wildfire regimes. Our findings call for mainstreaming fire and fuel management strategies into forest planning to increase resilience to fires, particularly in temperate regions with limited past fire occurrence and a projected increase in favourable fire weather."
10.5194/acp-26-2141-2026,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该论文研究了北海道札幌大气气溶胶中水溶性火成碳（WSPyC）的浓度及其来源，这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，例如空气质量监测和大气成分分析。,"['WSPyC', 'atmospheric aerosols', 'air quality monitoring']",Riku Miyase;Yuzo Miyazaki;Tomohisa Irino;Youhei Yamashita,"Factors controlling the concentration of water-soluble pyrogenic carbon in aerosols in Hokkaido, Japan","Water-soluble pyrogenic carbon (WSPyC) in the ocean is the ultimate sink for WSPyC, but its budget has not yet been fully quantified. This study observed the variations in the concentration of WSPyC in atmospheric aerosols in Sapporo, Hokkaido, over the course of a year, and examined its sources. The results suggest that WSPyC can be formed through the oxidation of soot during atmospheric transport, highlighting the need to reassess the global deposition flux of WSPyC. 
 Pyrogenic carbon (PyC) is a continuum of compounds generated during the incomplete combustion of biomass or fossil fuels. Water-soluble PyC (WSPyC), a PyC smaller than 0.7 µm, is transported to the ocean via rivers or atmospheric deposition and is considered a key component in the long-term regulation of the global carbon cycle. Compared to the riverine input flux, the atmospheric deposition flux of WSPyC may have large uncertainties due to limited observations. This study examines the factors influencing WSPyC concentration in atmospheric aerosols in Sapporo, Hokkaido, based on a year-round observation. The WSPyC concentration in the aerosols, determined with the benzene polycarboxylic acid method, ranged from 1.41 to 46.5 ng C m−3, with an average value of 13.7±10.6 ng C m−3. The average concentration was lower than previously observed near combustion sources. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analysis revealed that 60 % of the WSPyC concentration was attributed to a K+-dominated combustion, which included the burning of biomass and biofuels. Meanwhile, 40 % of WSPyC was associated with factors related to the atmospheric aging of aerosols derived from fossil fuel combustion. The global WSPyC deposition flux to the ocean has previously been estimated based on the concentration ratio of WSPyC to elemental carbon (EC) or water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC). The results of this study suggested that these ratios vary due to the atmospheric aging processes, including photochemical production of WSPyC from soot, indicating the need for a reassessment of the global WSPyC deposition flux."

We used drones and ground-based instruments to study how dust particles interact with light and relate this to their mass. Current methods often underestimate large dust particles, leading to errors in dust quantity. Our results show that regional differences in dust must be considered to improve climate models and satellite observations. 
 The volume-to-extinction ratio (ζ) is an important aerosol property, allowing to relate gravimetric and optical quantifications, widely used in remote sensing and in climate models. The ζ ratio is affected by the microphysical properties of aerosol particles, including their size, shape and composition. This study presents a synergistic approach combining airborne in-situ observations and ground-based remote sensing to study this ratio during dust events originating in the Middle East and Saharan regions, and to examine its vertical variability and general estimation uncertainty. The data were collected during the 2021 Cyprus Fall Campaign and the 2022 ASKOS campaign in Cabo Verde. The combination of observations offered vertically-resolved information on the particle size-distribution and volume-to-extinction ratio. The findings of this study reveal pronounced differences in the ζ ratio and effective radius across events and regions, reflecting variations in the degree of mixing with fine particles, as well as some variability with altitude due to varying particle size and shape. During Middle East dust events in Cyprus in fall 2021 the observed average ζ was the lowest with ζ=0.53±0.24 µm, whilst for a Saharan dust case in Cabo Verde in summer 2022 observations showed the highest values with ζ=1.14±1.01 µm, both values obtained at the dust layer altitude in some of the reported cases. The analysis highlights large discrepancies compared to AERONET-derived values and previous literature, especially in the presence of super-coarse and giant particles. Scattering computations allowed to evaluate the experimental results and provide insights into the role of particle asphericity. Atmospheric model simulations also showed discrepancies, mainly due to assumptions that neglect larger particles. These findings suggest that improved dust representation in models is essential for accurate climate assessment."

Using 45 years of reanalysis data, we found that warmer sea surface lead to a warmer Antarctic stratosphere during the subsequent austral winter. This link, driven by the planetary waves and reinforced by regional sea-ice loss, provides a new insight to make long-range forecasts for stratospheric warming. 
 In this study we examine the cross–seasonal effects of boreal winter sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the tropical central Pacific (Niño 4 region) on Antarctic stratospheric circulation and ozone transport during the subsequent austral winter using ERA5 reanalysis of 45 years (1980–2024). Our analyses show that warm (cold) SST anomalies in the Niño 4 region during December–February are associated with mid- and high-latitude stratospheric warming (cooling), a contracted (expanded) stratospheric polar vortex (SPV), and enhanced (suppressed) polar ozone concentrations in the subsequent July–September period. This delayed response is mediated by the Pacific–South America (PSA) teleconnection pattern, which excites planetary waves that propagate upward into the stratosphere, thereby modifying the Brewer–Dobson circulation and enhancing ozone poleward transport, ultimately warming polar stratosphere. In addition, as the influence of the Niño 4 SST anomalies on the PSA teleconnection pattern diminishes during July–September, surface heat feedback at mid- and high-latitude becomes critically important for planetary waves. For example, persistent southeastern Pacific SST warming and sea–ice loss over the Amundsen and Ross Seas reinforce planetary waves by releasing heat from ocean into atmosphere. A multivariate regression statistical model using factors of boreal winter Niño 4 SST and June PSA indices explains approximately 32 % of the variance in austral winter stratospheric temperatures. These findings highlight a previously underexplored pathway through which tropical Pacific SST anomalies modulate Antarctic stratospheric dynamics on cross-seasonal timescales."

Our findings provide evidence of the nonlinear responses of cloud systems to absorbing aerosols. When liquid water is relatively abundant compared to aerosol concentration, increased aerosols tend to enhance droplet formation; otherwise, aerosols may suppress cloud development by altering the surrounding environment. 
 Air masses carrying absorbing aerosols play a dual role by altering ambient supersaturation and acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), thus contributing to both the semi-direct and indirect aerosol effects. However, in real cloud development processes, aerosol influences can simultaneously act to suppress cloud formation or enhance droplet production, resulting in microphysical characteristics that remain difficult to describe. In the study, an aerosol and cloud microphysics experiment, focusing on warm cloud events strongly coupled with biomass-burning aerosols transported from the Southeast Asia Peninsula, was conducted in the spring of 2024 at the Lulin Atmospheric Background Station (LABS, 2862 m a.s.l.) in Taiwan. One-minute resolution of in-situ data was used in the data analysis, allowing exploration of the microphysical responses under varying mixing states of absorbing aerosol concentration and cloud liquid water content. This study applies the cloud-aerosol mixing ratio (e.g., mass concentration mixing ratio (MCr), log(LWC×106PM2.5)) in conjunction with the ACI index (ACINd=13(∂lnNd∂lnα)) to describe the behavior of aerosol-cloud interactions. Results identify two distinct responses: (1) under high MCr conditions (MCr>4.5), clouds exhibit features of the Twomey effect (ACINd≈0.08); (2) under low MCr conditions (MCr=3–4.5), not only is the ACINd less than −0.06, but the high aerosol loading also coincides with elevated temperatures, lower relative humidity, and a reduction in small droplets (<10 µm), consistent with a semi-direct effect. This study provides a comprehensive explanation of how absorbing aerosols influence cloud systems over East Asia and highlights the critical role of the cloud-aerosol mixing ratio in characterizing the microphysical responses associated with the Twomey effect and the semi-direct effect."

Distinct mechanisms of different-sized CIs in secondary organic aerosol formation were proposed, and a synergistic effect between RO2 autoxidation and CIs oligomerization was identified. This study provided new insights into the ozonolysis process from the Criegee chemistry perspective. 
 Criegee intermediates (CIs) are highly reactive species generated during the alkene ozonolysis, which play a critical role in atmospheric chemistry. Myrcene is a typical monoterpene, and its linear structure is significantly different from other cyclic monoterpenes such as α-pinene. This structural distinction consequently leads to different reactions mechanisms. This study employs a combined approach of matrix isolation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (MI-FTIR) and smog chamber experiments to elucidate the mechanisms of myrcene ozonolysis from the Criegee chemistry perspective. C3-CIs are captured at 880 cm−1 by using MI-FTIR. Ordered oligomers, which contain C3-CIs as chain units, are detected as significant components in secondary organic aerosol (SOA). These oligomers are formed via RO2+n C3-CIs + HO2/RO2 mechanisms. C7-CIs are more prone to unimolecular decomposition to form C7-RO2 radical, which act as initiators for oligomerization reactions. The mechanisms may also exist in other monoterpenes ozonolysis, which offering new insights into the contribution of CIs to SOA formation. Furthermore, the effect of the synergistic interaction between SCIs oligomerization and RO2 autoxidation is illustrated. The mechanisms facilitate the rapid formation of highly oxygenated species, playing a critical role in particle nucleation. The increase in relative humidity can effectively reduce the formation of higher-order oligomers, thereby suppressing the SOA yield. This study provides a systematic elucidation of myrcene ozonolysis mechanisms, thereby significantly enhancing the understanding of oxidation processes in acyclic monoterpenes."

We identify the terms with the largest uncertainties for current change and future projections that cause the large spread in precipitation change, as sensible heat and dry static energy flux divergence in Earth System models. However, the Earth System models show consistent agreement that there will be an increase in drying over continental Europe with global warming. 
 Observations indicate that parts of Europe have experienced summer drying over recent decades. There is, however, substantial uncertainty in terms of precipitation changes projected by global climate models, underscoring the need for improved understanding to guide adaptation. Here, we analyse changes in European summer precipitation with global warming in 35 CMIP6 Earth system Models using a regional atmospheric energy budget framework. Over the historical period we compare these models to two reanalysis datasets, ERA5 and MERRA-2, as well as the E-OBS daily gridded observational dataset. Although ERA5 and MERRA-2 compare well to observed precipitation, they diverge substantially from each other and exhibit large discrepancies with the CMIP6 models when evaluating other terms in the atmospheric energy budget. In future projections, variability across models increases relative to the historical period for the changes in precipitation, sensible heat and the dry static energy flux divergence, highlighting the uncertainties in the magnitude of these terms. Nevertheless, the models show consistent agreement on the projection of summer drying over continental Europe with anthropogenic forcing over time."

 The stratopause, the boundary between the stratosphere and the mesosphere, is projected to cool and drop in response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A lack of long-term observations with high vertical resolution at the stratopause has made it difficult to quantify trends in this region. We use observations from the Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imager System (OSIRIS) and the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument to assess the annual and inter-annual variability and to quantify trends in the stratopause temperature and height. The SABER and OSIRIS observations at the stratopause are highly correlated, and both show that the stratopause cooled by ∼ 0.5–1 K per decade during 2005–2021. The observations also suggest that the tropical stratopause moved lower during this time period by 300–475 m per decade.

Brandt,Controlled release testing of commercially available methane emission measurement technologies at the TADI facility,"This experiment tested the ability of different technologies to detect and measure methane emissions. Participating teams used satellites, drones, and other systems to estimate methane leak rates without knowing the true rate. Some systems were more accurate than others, and wind and other environmental conditions made measurements harder. Our findings help improve these tools and support efforts to track and reduce methane emissions as new environmental rules take shape in Europe and beyond. 
 This study presents an independent and blinded controlled release evaluation of methane detection and quantification technologies in Europe. Conducted at the TotalEnergies Anomalies Detection Initiatives (TADI) site in France, the campaign tested eight commercial systems – including satellite, drone, and continuous monitoring platforms – under controlled single-blind conditions. Participants submitted methane emission rate estimates without prior knowledge of true release values.  Performance was assessed through detection limit curves, parity plots, and statistical metrics including slope and R2. False positive detection rates ranged from 0 % to 11 %. Quantification slopes ranged from 0.09 to 1.13, with a trend toward underestimation, and R2 values ranged from 0.08 to 0.97. Wind conditions – particularly low speeds and high variability – were a key factor affecting quantification accuracy, emphasizing the need for high-quality wind data integration. This study underscores the importance of rigorous, standardized testing to benchmark technology performance and inform regulatory efforts. Results highlight platform-specific strengths and challenges, providing actionable insights for participants, policymakers, and regulators. These findings support the development of robust, validated methane measurement tools critical to achieving effective emissions monitoring and reduction strategies under evolving regulatory frameworks, such as those in the European Union."

The simulations are compared to two radiance-to-irradiance conversion approaches. Especially for viewing angles in the backscattering direction the approach that is aware of the cloud microphysics results in better flux estimates. 
 To accurately estimate outgoing top-of-atmosphere (TOA) shortwave (SW) fluxes from measurements of broadband radiances, angular distribution models (ADMs) are necessary. ADMs rely on radiance-predicting models that are trained on hemispherically-resolved CERES TOA radiance observations. The estimation of SW fluxes is particularly challenging for cloudy skies due to clouds' anisotropy, which substantially varies with their optical properties for any given sun-object-observer geometry. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of micro- and macrophysical properties of liquid clouds on SW fluxes estimated by ADMs that are based on a semi-physical model and compare to operational ADMs. We hypothesize that a microphysically aware ADM performs better in observation angles influenced by single-scattering features.The semi-physical approach relies on a parameterized asymmetry parameter gΔ, which depends on the cloud effective radius and, after adjustments during training of the model, explicitly varies with sun–observer geometry. We link these adjustments to single scattering features, such as the shift of the cloud bow and glory with varying cloud droplet sizes.For the investigation, 125 3D cloud scenes are constructed based on observational data and theoretical assumptions. Using a Monte Carlo model, the TOA broadband SW radiances and fluxes of the semi-synthetic cloud scenes are simulated for different scenarios with varying viewing angles (θv) along the principal plane and solar angles (θs). Based on the resulting 20 000 scenarios, the sensitivity and accuracy of the two SW radiance-to-irradiance conversion approaches to cloud droplet size, spatial distribution of liquid water path, and mean optical thickness are quantified.The study emphasizes that explicitly including the liquid droplet effective radius in ADM generation can improve the accuracy of shortwave flux estimates. Particularly for viewing geometries that exhibit single scattering phenomena, such as cloud glory and cloud bow, flux estimates can benefit from microphysically aware ADMs. For the analyzed scenarios, we found that the errors of instantaneous TOA SW flux estimates could be reduced by up to 25 W m−2. For scenes with very large or small droplets, the median error was reduced by up to 7 W m−2."

Davis,Laboratory and field assessment of mid-infrared absorption (MIRA) instrument performance for methane and ethane dry mole fractions,"This manuscript details laboratory and field-based testing of a tower-based methane and ethane measurement system to address the challenge of separating methane sources in oil and gas basins. We describe methods for managing water vapor, calibration, and estimating the various components of measurement uncertainty. With appropriate engineering and calibration, the instrument shows the capability to measure CH4 and C2H6 with sufficient stability to distinguish regional methane emission sources. 
 Concurrent measurements of methane (CH4) and ethane (C2H6) can be used to identify and separate methane sources, as ethane is present in thermogenic sources (e.g., oil and natural gas) but not in biogenic sources (e.g., agriculture). In this study, we evaluated the performance of multiple Aeris MIRA Ultra instruments (Versions 1 and 2) through controlled laboratory tests and tower-based deployments under field conditions. The systems were modified with an external pump, flow control, a Nafion dryer, and a custom-built auxiliary box to automate the system and transmit near real-time data. We determined the best calibration approach for our application, given practical limitations, to be a full calibration cycle (with ambient and high calibration cylinders) about once per day and an ambient calibration cylinder sampled hourly. Measurement uncertainty was assessed, including the uncertainty due to instrument noise as a function of calibration frequency, uncertainty in the water vapor correction, and cylinder assignment uncertainty. Instrument noise was the dominant source of uncertainty for C2H6, while the water vapor correction dominated the CH4 uncertainty. For Version 2 systems with hourly calibrations and a Nafion dryer with counterflow, the mean total uncertainty, including both systematic errors and noise, of hourly averages was 0.8–3.0 ppb CH4 and 0.35–0.37 ppb C2H6. Laboratory intercomparisons showed network compatibility within 1.2 ppb CH4 and 0.23 ppb C2H6, and a collocated deployment with a NOAA Picarro system agreed within 1.8 ppb CH4. Instrument noise varied substantially amongst the instruments, with errors reaching up to 11 ppb CH4 and 2 ppb C2H6 for hourly means, with similar variability indicated in a 50 h cylinder test. With appropriate engineering and calibration, the Aeris MIRA Ultra has the potential to distinguish regional methane emission sources in many field settings."

The present study describes the open access software GLOFI (GLObal wave FIt) which uses the 2D spectral decomposition to perform this removal. It is validated on simulated temperature observations synthesised for ESA (European Space Agency) Earth Explorer 11 candidate CAIRT (Changing-Atmosphere Infra-Red Tomography Explorer). 
 The direct analysis of atmospheric gravity waves (GWs) in temperature observations is difficult since the much stronger signal of large-scale temperature perturbations such as planetary waves obscure the perturbations due to GWs. The small-scale GW perturbations need to be isolated from the measurements by removing the large-scale temperature background, thereby revealing the object of analysis. In this study, the scale-separation via 2D spectral decomposition, which has the advantage of removing physical wave modes of zonal wavenumber up to 7 and wave frequency up to one cycle per day, is discussed. The technical implementation of this technique in a scale-separation Python-based toolbox, GLOFI (GLObal wave FIt), is detailed and demonstrated on a simulated satellite dataset for the ESA Earth Explorer 11 candidate CAIRT incorporating ECMWF ERA5 temperature data. Planetary wave spectra for the specified wavenumbers and frequencies are obtained by using a 28 d sliding window. These spectra are subsequently used to remove perturbations due to planetary waves from the measurements. This is followed by the removal of tides in a similar way but using a shorter 5 d sliding window and a fit of only stationary waves for ascending and descending orbits separately.For the considered dataset, the variances of the difference between reference and GLOFI-generated temperature background are an order of magnitude smaller than GW temperature variances, which suggests that the method removes the large-scale waves to a degree that enables the separation of the GW perturbations. Furthermore, the obtained spectra can be used to generate a global temperature background grid which approximately resembles the actual global temperature field. More importantly, the temperature background estimated by GLOFI at the satellite track coordinates is almost identical to the actual reference temperatures along the tracks. Regarding the performance on data including GW perturbations, the isolated small-scale temperature perturbations are virtually identical to the actual reference GW perturbations from the model.The GLOFI toolbox for scale separation of satellite observations is published as open access along this article."

Heat transfer peaks in spring, while water vapor release is highest in summer. Most stations act as carbon sinks, but one in a forested valley is a carbon source, likely due to vegetation loss and human activity. The findings highlight the strong connections between water, heat, and carbon fluxes, offering valuable insights into climate change and weather forecasting. 
 Land-atmosphere (LA) interactions, through the turbulent exchange of water, heat and CO2 fluxes, strongly influence regional micro-climates, water cycles, energy budgets, and ecosystem dynamics. The Tibetan Plateau (TP), characterized by its vast extent, high elevation, strong solar radiation and extreme weather variability, remains underexplored due to the scarcity of LA observation sites, particularly in its western and northern regions. This study introduces a newly established research and observation platform, comprising 16 planetary boundary layer towers that span diverse landscapes and dynamic meteorological conditions. Across these sites, mean annual air temperature, wind speed, and liquid precipitation range from −3.5 to 18.5 °C, 0.6 to 5.6 m s−1, and 43 to 2164 mm, respectively. Elevation exhibits significant correlations with all meteorological variables, highlighting the pronounced spatial heterogeneity of land–atmosphere coupling across the region. The turbulent fluxes of water and heat exhibit distinct seasonal patterns, with maximum sensible heat flux (SH) in April–May and latent heat flux (LE) in July–August. Most stations act as carbon sinks, with net ecosystem exchange (NEE; the net CO2 exchange between the ecosystem and the atmosphere, where negative values indicate net ecosystem CO2 uptake) ranging from −3.2 to −174.3 gCm-2a-1, except the Medog station, which behaves as a carbon source likely linked to vegetation disturbance and human activity. LE is significantly correlated with SH, NEE and ecosystem respiration, revealing a strong coupling among water, heat and carbon fluxes. This high-resolution, quality-controlled dataset provides critical in situ observations for studying water–heat–carbon coupling, validating models and satellite algorithms, and improving understanding of climate-ecosystem interactions over the TP.

By integrating multi-source remote sensing imagery with National Forest Inventory data, this dataset reveals spatiotemporal dynamics consistent with China's massive afforestation and ecological restoration initiatives. It serves as a critical tool for clarifying the impacts of forest cover change on the regional terrestrial carbon balance. 
 High-spatial-resolution and long-term data on forest cover and plant functional types (PFTs) are crucial for elucidating the effects of forest cover change on the national terrestrial carbon balance. Since the 1980s, China has experienced a substantial expansion in its forested area, primarily driven by large-scale national afforestation programs. However, existing land cover products often fail to capture this long-term increasing trend, leading to an underestimation of forest cover change–related ecological processes. Here, we developed a high-resolution (1 km), annual forest cover dataset for China for 1981–2023. This dataset integrates spatial constraints from multisource remote sensing data with provincial-level statistics from China's national forest inventories (NFIs), providing a consistent and spatially explicit record of forest dynamics over four decades. Building on this primary dataset, we further produced an annual PFT dataset that disaggregates total forest cover into nine distinct plant functional types suitable for use in dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs). Validation against independent data indicates that our reconstructed dataset achieves an overall accuracy (OA) of 84.86 % ± 1.18 % for five aggregated forest types (evergreen needleleaf forests, evergreen broadleaf forests, deciduous needleleaf forests, deciduous broadleaf forests, and mixed leaf forests), and it reproduces NFI-consistent forest dynamics (R2≈1). To evaluate its applicability, we implemented the dataset in the Lund–Potsdam–Jena General Ecosystem Simulator (LPJ–GUESS). Compared with the widely used PFT dataset from the European Space Agency's Land Cover Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) and the MODIS land cover type product (MCD12Q1), our product yields a markedly improved simulation of key biophysical and biogeochemical processes in China. Specifically, it reduced errors relative to over extensive regions, outperforming these baselines across 77.7 % and 85.2 % of the terrestrial area for gross primary productivity (GPP), 63.1 % and 69.7 % for net ecosystem exchange (NEE), 66.9 % and 77.3 % for the leaf area index (LAI), and 78.7 % and 85.3 % for actual evapotranspiration (ET). With its high spatial resolution, long-term temporal coverage, and detailed forest type classification, our dataset offers a robust foundation for assessing the ecological impacts of forest restoration and for constraining estimates of China's forest carbon sink since 1981.

We combined the long-term coverage of ERA5-Land with the high accuracy of SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) satellites to create a corrected global moisture dataset spanning 1950–2025. Validated against 3.8 million ground measurements, our product reduces errors by ~ 25 % in the modern period (2015–2020) and maintains ~ 20 % improvement historically (1960–2015). This reliable, daily 75-year record is essential for monitoring long-term climate trends and droughts. 
 Accurate, high-resolution soil moisture data are critical for hydrological modeling, climate studies, and ecosystem management. Unfortunately, current existing global products suffer from inconsistencies, coverage gaps, and biases. In this study, we evaluated the surface layers of three widely used soil moisture products, including ERA5-Land, ESA-CCI (v09.1 Combined), and SMAP L4 with resolutions ranging from 0.1 to 0.25°, against in situ measurements across five networks, including ISMN, CMA, Cemaden, COSMOS-Europe, and SONTE-China. The in situ dataset, to our knowledge, represents the most extensive global soil moisture compilation to date, comprising approximately 3.8 million records, organized into a primary dataset for modern validation (2015–2020) and an independent historical dataset (1960–2015). It is found that during the primary validation period (2015–2020), ERA5-Land exhibits high correlation (with correlation coefficient of 0.69) between measured and predicted soil moisture but the data also shows significant bias. SMAP L4 provides the highest accuracy (with root mean square error (RMSE) value of 0.088 m3 m−3) and low bias, but is limited by its temporal coverage from 2015 to the present. To address these gaps, we developed an adjusted ERA5-Land dataset spanning 1950 to 2025 by fusing ERA5-Land and SMAP L4 using a mean-variance rescaling method optimized for long time-series alignment, which enhanced the spatiotemporal coverage and reduced bias. Validation against the primary validation period demonstrates a reduction in RMSE of 24.6 % and an improvement in normalized Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NNSE) of 30.6 % compared to the original ERA5-Land products. Crucially, the reliability of the backward extension was verified against independent historical observations spanning 1960 to 2015, demonstrating sustained improvements over ERA5-Land with 19.7 % RMSE reduction and 26.6 % NNSE increase. This confirms the robustness of the adjustment parameters in the mean-variance rescaling method. The adjusted ERA5-Land dataset, which is publicly available, can be used as benchmark for future research and support drought monitoring, weather prediction, and water resource management, contributing to global climate resilience across diverse ecosystems.

GloWE-8D is the first publicly available global wind erosion product, offering reliable support for dust emission estimation, wind erosion mechanism studies, and land degradation monitoring at both global and regional scales. 
 Wind erosion constitutes a critical driver of global land degradation and dust emission, posing persistent threats to ecological security, agricultural production, and human health. Although regional-scale wind erosion assessments exist, there remains a lack of long-term, high spatiotemporal resolution, and publicly available global-scale wind erosion datasets, which has constrained a deeper understanding of its dynamic processes and driving mechanisms. Based on the Revised Wind Erosion Equation (RWEQ), this study constructed a global wind erosion dataset from 1982 to 2020 with an 8-day temporal resolution and a 0.05° spatial resolution. By introducing a residue factor scheme based on growing season identification, the characterization accuracy of wind erosion suppression during vegetation cover periods was enhanced, enabling a more refined depiction of episodic wind erosion features. The dataset revealed that the global annual average wind erosion total from 1982 to 2020 was 539.13 Pg, with severe erosion areas concentrated in the arid and semi-arid regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The wind erosion exhibited a slowly increasing trend, although with significant regional variations. Data validation demonstrated a high spatial consistency between this dataset and the MERRA-2 dust emission data (R2 = 0.79), and a significant temporal correlation with coarse-mode aerosol optical depth observations from AERONET stations. Furthermore, comparisons indicated that the results of this study were within the same order of magnitude and showed high correlation with existing regional research.

 Field-based measurements of soil health under various conservation management practices have been compiled into the global Soil Health Database (SoilHealthDB), supporting comprehensive analyses of the effects of systems such as cover cropping, no-tillage, agroforestry systems, and organic fertilization on soil health. To support more effective soil health assessments and related analyses, it is essential to maintain updated and standardized datasets. In response to this need, the existing database of SoilHealthDB has been updated and standardized as SoilHealthDB-V2. All soil health indicators were harmonized to improve consistency, traceability, and analytical accuracy. The number of observations increased from 5,907 to 8,874, expanding global spatiotemporal coverage and improving representation across diverse climate regions. Several new variables related to cover crop management have been introduced, including cover crop termination date, cash crop planting date, cover crop termination method and residue return method, cover crop irrigation and fertilization practices. These additions enable more detailed assessments of best management practices. Furthermore, the inclusion of experiment duration-related data allows for more robust investigations of temporal trends in soil health outcomes. New indicators related soil carbon pools further enhance the database’s utility for evaluating the effects of conservation practices on carbon cycling.

An arbitrary choice of the number of larvae released from each source location in forward tracking is found to cause ambiguous self-recruitment. In contrast, we found that an arbitrary choice of the number of larvae released from the settlement location in backtracking leads to unambiguous self-recruitment. 
 Accurately estimating self-recruitment (SR), which is the fraction of recruits at a location that originated locally, is fundamental to understanding population connectivity. Biophysical models typically compute SR by releasing larval particles from source locations and tracking them forward in time. However, forward-tracking studies employ a variety of particle-release strategies (random, constant, area-scaled or production-scaled), which often leads to ambiguous SR estimates. Using theoretical analysis supported by numerical simulations of Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) larvae in Lake Erie, we show that SR is inherently dependent on larval production at all source locations. As a result, SR cannot be computed unambiguously in forward-tracking models unless the true larval production is known and released from every source location. In contrast, empirical parentage-analysis studies estimate SR directly as the fraction of locally produced juveniles among those sampled at a settlement location, without quantifying larval production at all sources. Motivated by this, we computed SR using backward-in-time particle tracking from the settlement location. We demonstrate that SR estimated using backtracking is independent of the number of particles released, which provides considerable benefit; namely the use of any magnitude of particles released and eliminating the need to identify all contributing sources or their larval output. This reduces the effort required to estimate SR and provides a theoretically consistent basis for its calculation.

Grimeland;Chris Smith,The representation of climate impacts in the FRIDAv2.1 Integrated Assessment Model,"Computer models built to study future developments of human activity and climate change often exclude the impacts of climate change. Here, we include these effects in a new model. We create functions connecting changes in global temperature, carbon dioxide, and sea level to energy supply and demand, food systems, mortality, economic damages, and other important quantities. Including these effects will allow us to explore their impact on future changes in the human and climate realms. 
 Feedbacks from the climate to other components of the coupled human-Earth system are expected to strongly influence the co-evolution of human society and its environment. Representing these feedback loops between climate and society, via the Earth system's response to human activities and the subsequent effect back onto social systems, is essential in order to fully explore the dynamics of the coupled system. However, focus on these feedbacks has traditionally been limited, or excluded, in prior Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) and IAM-based modelling protocols. This limits the understanding of the effects of climate change and the response of the overall system to future emissions scenarios and policies.The new IAM Feedback-based knowledge Repository for IntegrateD Assessments version 2.1 (FRIDAv2.1), documented and explored within this paper collection, seeks to address this by internalising the feedbacks between subcomponents of the human-Earth system. Within this new IAM, these connections are therefore a key part of the structure, and are documented and discussed here.FRIDA represents these climate-to-society feedbacks, conceptualised as climate impacts, through global impact functions. Where possible, they are based on estimates from existing literature, reframed as functions of global climate variables to facilitate their representation within FRIDA. Other impact channels, with insufficient background literature to inform their structure and parameter values, are incorporated via the internal calibration of the IAM.Since the systematic representation of climate damages within an IAM is a relatively novel endeavour, the approach is constrained by literature limitations and necessary simplifications. In addition, the high level of abstraction of the FRIDA model imposes limits on the set of impacts which can reasonably be implemented, and the level of process detail amongst those included. Nevertheless, FRIDA's endogenous representation of climate feedbacks to human and natural systems enables valuable insights and intuition building on an underexplored topic. The general nature of the climate damage functions aggregated and documented here allows for their incorporation within other models and frameworks."

Here, we integrated a factorial microcosm experiment with stable isotope tracing and molecular techniques to disentangle how warming and MPs jointly regulate nitrogen (N) cycling in coastal sediments. We demonstrate that warming and MPs interacted nonadditively to reshape nitrification, denitrification, and associated nitrous oxide (N2O) production dynamics. Warming reversed the stimulatory effect of polyethylene (PE) on nitrification, turning it inhibitory, and amplified the suppressive impact of poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT), primarily through synergistic intensification of anoxic stress. In contrast, warming strengthened PE-driven stimulation of denitrification and mitigated PBAT-induced inhibition, likely due to the selective enrichment of nirS- and nosZ-harboring denitrifiers. Moreover, warming overturned the stimulatory effects of both PE and PBAT on N2O production, shifting toward inhibition through nitrifier denitrification, as substantiated by dual-isotope (15N–18O) tracing and genomic evidence. Collectively, these findings provide novel mechanistic insights into how warming interacts with MPs to reconfigure sedimentary N cycling, with broad implications for predicting the responses and evolution of coastal ecosystems under accelerating global change."

Spatiotemporal graph learning (STGL) has emerged as a powerful framework to represent such complexity, enabling accurate forecasting and real-time decision support from urban districts to national and even global scales. This review provides the first comprehensive synthesis of STGL tailored to urban environments. We summarize advances in graph construction, spatial and temporal modeling, and fusion strategies, and examine applications across urban water systems, soil and agriculture, air quality, and urban risk.

We developed HaloFormula, a software for high-confidence formula assignment of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and DBPs. The workflow integrates candidate selection from a newly constructed formula database, dynamic in situ generation of an isotope matrix database, and formula assignment based on spectral similarity indices, achieving high computational efficiency and assignment accuracy. By incorporating a dual-isotope labeling strategy using equimolar 14N/15N-labeled monochloramine, HaloFormula enhances assignment accuracy and enables differentiation of nitrogen origins. The method was validated across diverse FT-ICR-MS data sets, including DOM and model compounds treated by chlor(am)ination and UV-based processes. HaloFormula assigned 1,875 formulas for a Suwannee River Fulvic Acid data set, of which 937 exhibited 13C isotopes. For halogenated compounds, over 900 Cl-containing formulas were assigned, with more than 1,400 isotopic peaks exhibiting accurate isotopic distributions. Up to 17 isotopologues were detected for individual N-DBPs due to enhanced 15N detection from the dual-isotope labeling strategy, enabling unambiguous formula assignment and nitrogen origin tracking. This novel methodology is readily adaptable for elucidating nitrogen sources in other systems and extendable to broader elemental analyses."

Moreover, cathode failure during prolonged operation remains a significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a membrane-free electrochemical separation (MFES) and fluidized bed crystallization (FB) process. The MFES unit employs cathode boundary-layer pumping to rapidly separate cathodically generated OH– from bulk solution, achieving >96.0% phosphate removal without membranes. This system effectively treats phosphate (5–60 mg·L–1) and Ca2+ (10–100 mg·L–1) across varying concentrations and demonstrates robust tolerance to interfering ions (Mg2+, HCO3–, and NH4+). Using a 15 mm × 10 mm pore stainless-steel cathode, the process maintained >80.0% P removal during continuous 700 h operation without operational interruptions (e.g., backflushing). The MFES effluent feeds directly into the FB system, where fluidization accelerates amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) adsorption and crystallization onto seeds, enabling rapid product recovery. The MFES-FB process achieves (1) 73.8% overall P recovery and (2) energy consumption of 55.3 kWh·kg P–1 while eliminating membrane materials throughout the entire process. This study not only achieves long-term stable operation, demonstrating strong practicality and scalability, but more importantly reveals a “spatiotemporal decoupling” synergistic mechanism. This insight may help stimulate fresh perspectives for the future development of novel electrochemical resource recovery systems."

While hydrogen may provide global public good for reducing carbon emissions, it is important to quantify its potential impact on  local communities for ensuring equitable and socially accepted energy transitions. This study quantifies the effects of hydrogen infrastructure on nearby communities by using a high-resolution panel of residential property transactions in California from 2012 to 2021. The analysis incorporates three types of hydrogen infrastructure: hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs), hydrogen production facilities (HPFs), and hydrogen corridor pipelines (HCPs). Our findings show that residential properties within a 2.2 km radius of an HRS experience an average devaluation of 2.74%–3.45% (or US$19,413–$24,444). Following a major hydrogen explosion, this depreciation intensifies to 4.41%–5.28%. HPFs also exert significant negative externalities, with property values declining by 4.52%–5.64% within a 4 km radius. Heterogeneity analyses reveal that minority communities, particularly those with low shares of White residents and high proportions of Black and Hispanic populations, experienced disproportionately greater devaluation. Our empirical evidence of the local impact can help policymakers better systematically promote the larger scale of hydrogen energy deployment while minimizing the potential negative impacts on local communities."

However, the relative importance of planktonic and benthic biomagnification pathways to fish MMHg concentrations in marine food webs is challenging to quantify. Here, we apply compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) of Hg to identify fish MMHg biomagnification pathways across nearshore bay (NB), marine continental shelf (MCS), and pelagic ocean (PO) regions. We observe significant differences in Δ199Hg between MMHg and total mercury (THg), highlighting the limitations of using THg isotopes to resolve MMHg dynamics in the environment. In NB fish, Δ199Hg of MMHg closely matches that of benthic invertebrates, while in MCS and PO fish, it aligns with phytoplankton. According to the MMHg isotope binary mixing model, about 85% of MMHg in NB fish derives from the benthic biomagnification pathway, whereas over 90% of MMHg in MCS and PO fish originates from seawater-phytoplankton trophic transfer. These findings reveal that the benthic biomagnification pathway in near-shore regions has been underestimated in previous models, leading to potential uncertainties in evaluating marine Hg cycling and human exposure risks. This study highlights the importance of the benthic biomagnification pathway in coastal environments and demonstrates the potential of the CSIA of Hg for investigating MMHg biomagnification pathways in marine food webs, which provides new insights for global Hg pollution management under the Minamata Convention."

Here, we quantified γMgly on deliquesced pH-buffered ammonium nitrate (AN) and sulfate/nitrate/ammonium (SNA) aerosols via flow tube experiments by directly measuring SOA formation under variable relative humidity (RH, 75–92%) and pH (3.1–4.4). For AN aerosols, γMgly ranged from 1.92 × 10–4 to 7.29 × 10–4, increasing with enhanced RH due to salting-out effects. Moreover, γMgly decreased by a factor of 2 to 10 as pH rose from 3.15 to 4.4 with NH3 addition, suggesting that acid-catalyzed reactions dominate the Mgly uptake. The pH dependence was captured by a first-order reaction rate constant (kI = 102.44–0.85·pH, R2 = 0.93). This kinetic parameter, together with effective Henry’s law constants, can be implemented to update the γMgly parametrization. Addition of sulfate aerosols was found to strongly suppress γMgly, reducing kI to 12–38% of the estimation on AN-alone aerosols at a similar pH. Our findings underscore the critical role of aerosol pH and composition in Mgly uptake and provide kinetic parameters to atmospheric models to improve predictions of Mgly SOA."

This study integrates epidemiological and in vitro and in vivo evidence to elucidate the role of Fe homeostasis in the effects of PM2.5 exposure on lung injury. Serum was collected from 35 women from Hebei Province, North China, and their residential PM2.5 concentrations were monitored from January 2015 to January 2016. We found that the ferritin light chain (FTL) in serum was positively associated with the PM2.5 concentration, suggesting that PM2.5 disrupts Fe homeostasis in the human body. Intratracheal instillation of naphthalene-1,4-dione-coated black carbon (1,4-NQ-BC), a PM2.5 analogue, increased FTL, but impaired the autophagy flux in rat lungs. 1,4-NQ-BC reduced Fe2+, but increased total Fe in RAW264.7 cells, when there was unimpaired Fe transportation through cell membranes. Likewise, 1,4-NQ-BC activated autophagy, but impaired lysosomal function, consequently inhibiting the autophagic flux in RAW264.7 cells. The role of lysosome dysfunction in PM-induced Fe2+ deficiency was revealed for the first time, via overexpression of transcription factor EB in a RAW264.7 cell model. We concluded that lysosomal damage-evoked Fe2+ deficiency provided sensitive biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets in pulmonary injury associated with ambient PM2.5 exposure."

Here, 41 physicochemical properties were characterized across 30 dust samples and evaluated for associations with EMT progression in A549 lung epithelial cells after 24-h exposure. EMT was assessed using three hallmarks: E-cadherin downregulation, vimentin upregulation, and α-SMA upregulation. A hybrid feature selection strategy combining correlation filtering with LassoLarsCV reduced feature redundancy and improved model robustness. The selected features were modeled using optimized regressors (Extreme Gradient Boosting regressor for E-cadherin and Vimentin; Support Vector Machine for α-SMA), and SHAP analysis quantified each property’s contribution. Crystalline silica emerged as the most influential factor, showing negative associations with E-cadherin and positive associations with Vimentin and α-SMA. In contrast, sodium-, aluminum-, and rutile-bearing components were associated with lower EMT progression, likely reflecting their occurrence within less reactive mineral phases than crystalline silica. Specific surface area and absolute ζ potential were positively associated with the EMT, indicating enhanced particle-cell interactions and surface-related signaling. These findings establish a framework for linking dust physicochemical characteristics to marker-specific EMT responses and demonstrate the effectiveness of interpretable machine learning for particulate toxicity assessment."

Here, we report year-round characterization of ACs (nitrated phenols (NPs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and nitrated PAHs (NPAHs)) in PM2.5 at Mt. Gongga, Tibetan Plateau (TP). AC concentrations were higher in the dry season (1.38 vs 0.94 ng m–3), but mass absorption coefficients at 365 nm (MAC365) peaked in the wet season from higher aerosol liquid water content and elevated pH. Clear-sky direct RF (DRF) was positive in the wet season (5.7 × 10–4 W m–2) driven by NPs (single scattering albedo (SSA) = 0.81; imaginary part (k) = 0.055 at 365 nm) and stronger in the dry season (6.8 × 10–3 W m–2) due to higher AC concentrations and solar radiation. Under all-sky conditions, multiple scattering further amplifies DRF, highlighting the cloud modulation of BrC climatic effects. Dry-season biomass-burning transport from South and Central Asia enhanced AC deposition, elevating median snow RF ∼19-fold (4.6 × 10–4 vs 8.6 × 10–3 W m–2) through snow darkening and aging.

In wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), it is crucial to understand the metabolism of biochemical indicators (BCIs) because metabolites are indicative of consumption (e.g., illicit drugs, pharmaceuticals) or unintentional exposure (e.g., pesticides, endocrine disruptors). Phase I metabolites are more widely studied in WBE due to a combination of factors, including, but not limited to, stability and analyte cost. Phase II metabolites are often assumed to deconjugate within the sewer network due to high native concentrations of enzymes. This work deconstructs this assumption and demonstrates how the in-sewer stability of phase II metabolites is dependent on both the parent structure and the conjugate type. In total, 79 BCIs were assessed and compared to urinary metabolism studies via time-variable enzymatic deconjugation using two enzymes, β-glucuronidase and arylsulfatase. The concentrations of free analytes excreted as N-glucuronides, O-glucuronides, and sulfates increased following deconjugation, reinforcing the persistence of these BCIs during transport throughout the sewer network. Conversely, no concentration increase was observed for acylglucuronides, demonstrating complete in-sewer glucuronide cleavage. In-freezer stability of conjugates was also assessed over 6 months, where it was observed that the stability of the parent structure is the driver of stability rather than the conjugates themselves, indicating minimal enzymatic activity upon storage. Overall, this paper presents a framework that can be deployed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of phase II metabolism and improve the accuracy of WBE workflows as well as environmental risk assessment approaches."

This work represents the first demonstration of real-time neutron radiography of hydrogen migration in reservoir and caprock lithologies. Cylindrical cores of Indiana limestone, Amherst Gray sandstone, and Tumey shale were subjected to constant-pressure hydrogen charging and scanned in real time using high-resolution neutron radiography. Results indicate immediate hydrogen infiltration in sandstone and limestone, with homogeneous distribution detected throughout their pore structure. In contrast, hydrogen remained largely absent from fine-grained shale under the same pressure, except in an apparently localized fracture zone, where neutron signatures confirmed the presence of hydrogen. Subsequent neutron CT of the sandstone sample, using image subtraction against an uncharged reference, corroborated hydrogen distribution patterns. Even under low-pressure, single-phase conditions, distinct neutron imaging signatures of hydrogen were achieved.

This study explored the influence of extended exposure to polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) on the growth and movement of A549 lung cancer cells, with particular emphasis on the molecular mechanisms involved in metabolic reprogramming. We demonstrated that prolonged exposure to PS-NPs markedly increased the ability of lung cancer cells to proliferate and migrate. Using an integrated approach combining transcriptomic profiling and C13-labeled glucose flux analysis, we observed that chronic PS-NPs exposure induced metabolic reprogramming characterized by the activation of gluconeogenesis and suppression of glycolysis. Mechanistically, PS-NPs upregulated the gluconeogenic enzyme mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK2) and downregulated enolase-1  (ENO1), a glycolytic enzyme. Notably, knockdown of PCK2 attenuated PS-NPs-induced cell proliferation and migration, underscoring its functional role. We further identified that stress-responsive activating transcription factor-3 (ATF3) serves as a crucial mediator of PCK2 and ENO1 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by PCR (ChIP-PCR) confirmed enhanced binding of ATF3 to the promoter regions of PCK2 and ENO1 upon PS-NPs exposure. Silencing ATF3 abolished PS-NPs-induced changes in PCK2 and ENO1 expression and blocked the associated increase in cell proliferation and migration. Clinically, elevated ATF3 and PCK2 expression levels are associated with poor prognosis in patients with lung cancer. In conclusion, chronic exposure to PS-NPs promotes lung cancer progression by inducing metabolic reprogramming via ATF3-mediated regulation of PCK2 and ENO1. These findings shed light on the cancer-promoting capabilities of PS-NPs and identify the ATF3-PCK2 axis as a promising target for lung cancer therapy."

We conducted a repeated-measures panel study of 76 healthy older adults in Jinan, China, with five monthly clinical examinations. Pedestrian-level neighborhood greenspace exposure was quantified using AI-based semantic segmentation of street-view videos collected around participants’ residences. Pulmonary and cardiovascular function were repeatedly assessed, alongside multiomics profiling of blood and urine samples. Linear mixed-effect models were used to examine associations of greenspace exposure with cardiopulmonary outcomes, while causal inference tests and integrative pathway analyses explored potential biological mechanisms. Higher neighborhood greenspace exposure was significantly associated with improved forced vital capacity (FVC), but not with other pulmonary indices or cardiovascular outcomes. In fully adjusted models, each interquartile range (IQR) increase in greenspace exposure was associated with a 189.9 mL (95% CI: 35.9 to 343.2 mL) increase in FVC. Multiomics analyses identified mediating metabolites, lipids, transcripts, and enriched pathways related to immune activation, nitric oxide metabolism, and DNA repair. These findings suggest that pedestrian-level greenness exposure may enhance pulmonary function in older adults through specific biological pathways, highlighting the importance of microscale urban greening for respiratory health."

The convection electric field is higher for stormtime BBFs which is primarily associated with an elevated magnetic field in the plasma sheet during storms. Moreover, stormtime plasma sheet conditions, such as an enhanced magnetic field and an elevated ion temperature, are reflected in the properties of BBFs indicating the strong influence of the background plasma environment on BBF dynamics."

Wolff,Climate Change and Disparities in Extreme Heat Exposure for Socially Vulnerable Areas in the Contiguous United States,"Socially vulnerable communities within the contiguous United States (CONUS) face disproportionate heat exposure, yet how these disparities will change under future warming remains unclear. Although socially vulnerable communities already experience higher air temperatures, high‐resolution downscaled climate projections have not been used to assess future exposure disparities under different Global Warming Levels (GWLs). Here, we evaluate past and future daily maximum air temperature exposure across CONUS for high‐ and low‐vulnerability locations using the Social Vulnerability Index. We find the disparity in air temperature exposure for high‐SVI areas increased from ∼1.3°C (∼2.3°F) 1951–1980 to ∼1.6°C (∼2.9°F) 1994–2023. Using an ensemble of downscaled climate models, we assess future impacts at GWLs of 1.5°C, 2°C, and 3°C (2.7°F, 3.6°F, and 5.4°F). We compare the number of days/year that exceed air temperature thresholds recommended for safe fan use (35°C, 39°C, or 95°F, 102.2°F) in high‐SVI and low‐SVI areas. We find that for exposure to a 35°C air temperature threshold, at 1.5°C global warming there is an average annual exposure difference of ∼16 days, at 2°C ∼18 days, and at 3°C ∼22 days. For exposure to a 39°C threshold, at 1.5°C global warming there is an exposure difference of ∼5 days, at 2°C ∼6 days, and at 3°C ∼9 days. These results highlight that future warming will disproportionately increase the number of days exceeding adaptation‐relevant air temperature thresholds in high‐SVI areas. These findings support the need to slow global warming and direct adaptation efforts toward more vulnerable communities."

Clean air actions in China, Europe, and North America reduced anthropogenic aerosols, whereas Siberia experienced increased wildfire aerosols due to local warm and dry conditions. South Asia exhibited mixed trends with increased emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and decreased carbonaceous aerosols. Using the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1), this study investigates Arctic climate responses to these regional aerosol changes. Reductions in aerosols from China and Europe‐North America resulted in Arctic warming effects of +0.18°C and +0.16°C, respectively, while changes in South Asian aerosols had a relatively small influence on Arctic climate. Increased aerosols from Siberian wildfires induced an Arctic cooling effect of −0.84°C, outweighing the warming from reduced anthropogenic aerosols. These cooling/warming effects are primarily attributed to changes in northward heat transport driven by aerosol changes outside the Arctic, rather than Arctic local radiative forcing. This research highlights the relationship between regional aerosols and Arctic climate, emphasizing a negative feedback mechanism via which increased Siberian wildfire aerosols, amidst accelerated warming in the Arctic Siberia, buffer the Arctic warming. It also implies that future Arctic warming could amplify Siberian wildfires, potentially reinforcing this negative feedback."

 Bacteriophage–antibiotic coadministration is increasingly used for refractory infections, yet the in vivo interactions among phages, bacteria, antibiotics, and host immunity remain poorly defined. We report a longitudinal, multiomic case analysis of a male in his seventies with cystic fibrosis (CF) experiencing an acute-on-chronic pulmonary exacerbation caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa. After colistin discontinuation due to nephrotoxicity, ciprofloxacin was initiated, with an intravenous two-phage cocktail introduced days later. Distinct mucoid and nonmucoid bacterial subpopulations associated differentially with antibiotic versus phage exposure, consistent with nonoverlapping selective pressures. Phage activity was temporally constrained, with one phage dominating early bacterial and genomic signals before attenuating after approximately seven days, despite continued genomic detectability. In contrast, the second phage showed no evidence of productive activity. This asymmetry coincided with phage-reactive humoral immunity: pre-existing IgM was associated with lack of recoverability of one phage, while treatment-associated IgM emergence temporally tracked attenuation of the dominant phage. Although phage-resistant variants arose during therapy, they showed limited expansion relative to susceptible populations. These findings define a mechanistic framework—chemobiotherapy—in which chemical and biological antimicrobials coordinate through ecological and immunologic complementarity rather than direct pharmacologic synergy.

This variability mode will potentially amplify northern Europe warming by up to 30% over 2000-2035. 
 Europe has experienced abnormal warming over the recent decades. Model-based studies highlight that multi-centennial internal variability of the North Atlantic can strongly affect European temperatures. However, the limited availability of high-resolution proxy records has hindered observational assessment of the existence and amplitude of such variability in the real climate system. Here, we compile annual-to-decadal proxy-based Holocene reconstructions, instrumental observations, and climate model simulations to demonstrate the existence of this multi-centennial variability mode and quantify its amplitude. We show that this mode is closely tied to the internal variability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Its temporal evolution explains part of the observed 20th century variability, and a shift towards a positive phase in the late 1990s can explain the recent amplified warming over Europe. When its amplitude is constrained by observations, this internal variability may enhance anthropogenic warming in Northern Europe by up to 30% over 2000–2035.

 Compositionally engineered metal-organic frameworks are designed and used to fabricate ultrafast scintillating films. The inclusion of hafnium ions in the nodes of the metal-organic framework enhances the interaction with ionizing radiation, partially compensating for the low density of the porous material and increasing the scintillation yield. The high diffusivity of molecular excitons within the framed conjugated ligands allows bimolecular annihilation processes that partially quench the system luminescence, resulting in fast scintillation pulses in the hundreds of picoseconds time scale. Despite the quenching, the gain in scintillation yield achieved is large enough to maintain the film light yield above 104 ph MeV-1 under soft X-rays. These high efficiencies and fast emission kinetics are obtained at room temperature in a technologically attractive solid-state configuration, placing the metal-organic framework platform in a prominent position for the realization of the next generation of fast scintillation counters for high-energy physics studies and medical imaging applications.

 In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, cisplatin is known to be associated with poor treatment compliance and notable side effects. More effective and safer platinum drugs are needed for the treatment of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In 2021, our multicenter, randomized, phase 3 trial reported that lobaplatin and fluorouracil induction chemotherapy plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy resulted in non-inferior survival and fewer toxic effects than did cisplatin-based therapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Data from the 10-year survival analysis are updated here. With a median follow-up of 10.6 years in the intention-to-treat population, 10-year progression-free survival is 70.7% in the lobaplatin-based therapy group vs. 71.9% in the cisplatin-based therapy group (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.72–1.43; log-rank p = 0.885). The difference between the groups is 1.2% (95% CI −6.7–9.1, pnon-inferiority = 0.015), which is lower than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 10%. The results are similar when we analyze patients in the per-protocol population. In the univariable and multivariable analyses, stage is an independent prognostic factor for progression-free survival (p = 0.001). The subgroup analyses suggest that the non-inferiority of lobaplatin-based therapy did not differ among specific populations. The incidence of late toxic effects is similar between the therapy groups, except for grades 1–2 peripheral neuropathy (p = 0.033), grades 1–2 deafness/otitis (p = 0.021), and grades 1–2/3 nephrotoxicity (p = 0.005; p = 0.021), the incidence of which is greater in the cisplatin-based therapy group than in the lobaplatin-based therapy group. Our findings suggest that lobaplatin and fluorouracil induction chemotherapy plus lobaplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy is an alternative doublet treatment strategy to cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), cisplatin is known to be associated with poor treatment compliance and notable side effects therefore more effective platinum drugs are expected.

Yang,Degraders of the dengue virus capsid protein exhibit differentiated pharmacology relative to capsid inhibitors,"The authors demonstrate that targeted protein degradation of the dengue virus capsid suppresses infection through capsid-dependent pathways rather than classical inhibition, revealing a new antiviral strategy effective against resistant viral variants. 
 Due to the limited size of viral genomes, most viral proteins are multifunctional; yet most direct-acting antivirals are designed as single-function inhibitors. The dengue virus (DENV) capsid protein serves as a building block for new virions while also interacting with multiple host factors to remodel the cellular environment. Using established capsid inhibitor ST148 as a targeting ligand, we develop a DENV capsid degrader, RPG-01-132, that exhibits a broadened spectrum of activity against the four DENV serotypes and an ST148-resistant mutant virus. Using multiple approaches, we show that RPG-01-132’s sub-micromolar antiviral activity is due to CRL4CRBN-dependent degradation of capsid and that this mechanism disrupts capsid-related pathways required for productive infection, including infectious virus output and capsid-mediated antagonism of the interferon response. This pharmacology is well-differentiated from ST148, which interferes with assembly of new virions, but has no demonstrated effect on the capsid’s nonstructural functions. These findings demonstrate that targeted protein degradation can thus enable antiviral pharmacology not observed with conventional antiviral inhibitors and that is resilient to point mutations that reduce inhibitor potency. The authors demonstrate that targeted protein degradation of the dengue virus capsid suppresses infection through capsid-dependent pathways rather than classical inhibition, revealing a new antiviral strategy effective against resistant viral variants."

Here, the authors report that chromium doping can enhance the activity and stability of cobalt spinel oxide through promoting interfacial water dissociation. 
 Although cobalt spinel oxide-based catalysts have demonstrated promising performance for the oxygen evolution reaction in acid, strategies reported have largely focused on manipulating the binding energies of reaction intermediates through tailoring the inherent electronic structures. The role of interfacial water structures on the electrode surface in promoting the acidic oxygen evolution reaction performance through controlled water activation has been largely overlooked. Here we show that introducing chromium dopant into cobalt spinel oxide can simultaneously increase the activity and stability by promoting interfacial water dissociation and dynamic electron transfer. The chromium dopant can not only dynamically regulate the electronic structure of cobalt and mitigate the over-oxidation of active cobalt sites at high overpotential, but also enhance the coverage of hydroxyl species on the catalyst surface, thereby optimizing the interfacial water structure, accelerating the reactant free-water supply and promoting subsequent interfacial water dissociation. Consequently, the obtained catalyst demonstrates enhanced performance in both solution electrocatalysis and device electrocatalysis. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of enhancing the acidic oxygen evolution reaction performance by promoting interfacial water dissociation. The role of interfacial water structures in regulating the acidic oxygen evolution performance of cobalt spinel oxides has long been overlooked.

This article shows that abundant CO-rich syngas can be directly used to synthesize ethylene. 
 The electrochemical carbon monoxide reduction (COR) reaction offers a carbon- and energy-efficient pathway to ethylene. However, present systems typically rely on pure CO, making the process costly and difficult to scale. An economically feasible alternative is to use syngas—the predominant industrial CO source—produced globally at quantities approximately 250 times higher than pure CO, but containing hydrogen and other components. Therefore, for a syngas-based COR system, achieving high single-pass conversion efficiency (SPCE) is essential, as high gas flow rates introduce excess hydrogen, complicating and increasing the cost of downstream product separation. Nevertheless, optimizing SPCE leads to hydrogen dilution and insufficient CO transport to the copper cathode, which in turn decreases ethylene Faradaic efficiency (FE). To overcome this trade-off, guided by Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory, here we develop a COOH-functionalized active carbon material which captures CO from syngas, strengthens CO adsorption on the copper cathode and thereby enhances ethylene FE even under CO-diluted conditions. This design enables an ethylene FE of 72% alongside a CO SPCE of 73% in a simulated syngas containing an H2/CO ratio of 2/1—outperforming reported systems operated with pure CO feed and offering a more scalable, resource-efficient route to sustainable ethylene. Producing valuable hydrocarbons electrochemically from carbon monoxide (CO) is an energy-efficient pathway, but reliance on costly pure CO as a feedstock limits its economic viability. This article shows that abundant CO-rich syngas can be directly used to synthesize ethylene."

 The balance between liquid and ice in clouds remains a major challenge in climate modeling, largely due to uncertainties in ice-related processes. We investigate the relative importance of four microphysical processes—primary ice nucleation (PIN), secondary ice production (SIP), sedimentation, and transport of ice crystals—for the supercooled liquid fraction (SLF) in mixed-phase clouds using three global climate models: EC-Earth3-AerChem, NorESM2-MM, and ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3. All models identify PIN as the dominant influence on SLF at cold temperatures in high northern latitudes, but diverge elsewhere and for higher temperatures. Implementing a unified SIP parameterization produced varied model responses, revealing fundamental differences in how microphysical processes interact within each model framework. These discrepancies suggest that each model prioritizes different processes in shaping the cloud phase. Such divergence may limit the reliability of conclusions regarding microphysical processes drawn from any single model."

Hoffman,Flash flourishing of Northern Hemisphere vegetation and its drivers,"Flash flourishing of Northern Hemisphere vegetation and its drivers 
 Rapid surges in vegetation growth—defined by thresholds in growth rate and duration—are critical yet understudied indicators of ecosystem responses to environmental change. Here, we investigate spatiotemporal patterns of such abrupt, short-lived flash flourishing events across the northern extratropical latitudes (NEL) from 2003 to 2022. We find more frequent occurrence of flash flourishing events at high latitudes (≥45° N), where their incidence is 1.6 times higher than at mid-latitudes. Moreover, there is an increasing tendency in frequency, duration, and intensity of flash flourishing events over the past two decades, alongside consistent rises in vegetation indices across onset, post-onset, and entire phases. Model simulations attribute these multiyear increases primarily to elevated atmospheric CO2, while temperature and radiation predominantly control phase-specific variability, with onset traits strongly predicting subsequent phenological responses. Together, these findings identify the patterns and drivers of NEL flash flourishing and highlight their large-scale impacts on ecosystem dynamics, offering critical insights for model improvement and the assessment of ecological shifts."

 Variable renewable energy droughts, so called Dunkelflaute events, emerge as a challenge for climate-neutral energy systems based on variable renewables. Here we characterize European drought events for on- and offshore wind power, solar photovoltaics, and renewable technology portfolios, using 38 historic weather years and an advanced identification method. Their characteristics heavily depend on the chosen drought threshold, questioning the usefulness of single-threshold analyses. Applying a multi-threshold framework, we quantify how the complementarity of wind and solar power temporally and spatially alleviates drought frequency, return periods, duration, and severity within (portfolio effect) and across countries (balancing effect). We identify the most extreme droughts, which drive major discharging periods of long-duration storage in a fully renewable European energy system, based on a policy-relevant decarbonization scenario. Such events comprise sequences of shorter droughts of varying severity. The most extreme event occurred in winter 1996/97 and lasted 55 days in an idealized, perfectly interconnected setting. The average renewable availability during this period was still 47% of its long-run mean. System planners must consider such events when planning for storage and other flexibility technologies. Methodologically, we conclude that using arbitrary single calendar years is not suitable for modeling weather-resilient energy scenarios.  Temporal and spatial complementarities between wind and solar power strongly reduce the frequency, duration, and severity of Europe’s variable renewable energy droughts, according to a 38-year, multi-threshold analysis."

 Hydroclimate changes in Northern Africa reflect the interplay between mid-latitude westerlies and the West African monsoon, along with their intensity variations. The response of these atmospheric circulation systems to changing boundary conditions and their impacts on the precipitation during past episodes of climate change remain unconstrained, because of scarcity of well-dated terrestrial hydroclimate records from Northern Africa that reach beyond the Holocene interglacial. We present a 300,000-year hydroclimate record inferred from periods of speleothem formation from Tunisia, located in the northernmost Africa. This record captures the alternation of humid and arid phases during glacial and interglacial climate states, as well as the superimposed millennial-scale events. Humid conditions prevailed during the interglacial periods, while arid conditions were associated to glacial boundary conditions. Cave evidence suggests that these humid phases in northernmost Africa could mainly be attributed to the southward shift and strengthening of the mid-latitude westerlies and the Mediterranean storm track during interglacials, and vice versa in glacials. A comparison with palaeolake records from the Sahara suggests suggests that during interglacials winter westerlies and the summer West African Monsoon were crucial to bring moisture in Northern Africa, contributing to the development of wet conditions in the Sahara.  Humid climate in Northern Africa prevailed during interglacial periods over the past 300,000 years and was mainly driven by southward shifts and intensification of mid-latitude westerlies and the Mediterranean storm track, based on speleothem records from Tunisia."

 With shifting environmental trends, many Earth system elements may be poised to undergo critical transitions or ‘tipping’. Reliable anticipation of these tipping elements is vital to inform policy decisions. Many of the current methods for tipping point detection are based on loss of resilience or ‘critical slowdown’ of the system as it approaches a tipping point. However, these methods are prone to false alarms; the detected slowdown may be an artifact of nonstationary noise unrelated to tipping behavior. Here, we explore the efficacy of early warning signs based on a nonequilibrium thermodynamics framework. The model-free detection method relies on the increased intrinsic time-irreversibility due to detailed balance breaking, preceding the onset of tipping or instabilities. We demonstrate that these EWSs are effective for tipping point detection and robust against false alarms due to nonstationary noise, using idealized models for two key elements of the Earth system that are prone to tipping: the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and Arctic sea-ice loss. Increased intrinsic time-irreversibility provides a robust early warning for Earth system tipping points, outperforming traditional methods in the presence of nonstationary noise, according to a study based on a nonequilibrium thermodynamics framework."

 Glaciers in High Mountain Asia (HMA) are important water sources for millions of people in arid regions. However, their mass balance exhibits strong regional heterogeneity. The reasons are still not well understood mainly due to limited high-resolution temperature and precipitation datasets in high-altitude zones. Here, we propose a glacier ablation and accumulation index based on firn and snow observation from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar data, which represent the seasonal ablation and accumulation patterns across HMA. Evaluations of the index with the summer snow line, precipitation, and temperature records from supraglacial weather stations confirm their reliability. Comparisons to available mass balance data show that glaciers with the lowest ablation and lowest summer-accumulation index which are located in the center of the HMA region, have the most balanced state (+0.05 m w.e. a-1). In contrast, glaciers with a high ablation and median summer-accumulation index, show highly negative mass balances (−0.47 m w.e. a-1). Under similar ablation index, the type of glaciers with higher summer-accumulation index is more negative. This work provides novel methods and knowledge to understand and project the glacier mass balance heterogeneity in HMA."

 The arid and semi-arid regions of the Eurasian continent (the Eurasian arid region) are home to extensive shrublands and these shrublands are critical components of the regional biomes. However, identifying shrublands and distinguishing them from grasslands via remote sensing remains challenging due to their spectral and phenological similarity, as evidenced by the varying distribution areas and patterns of shrublands across each common land cover product. To address this, we combined a multi-strategy sampling framework with a phenology-pixel-based method to map shrubland distribution in the arid Eurasian region. We achieved a mean F1 score of 67.05%, notably higher than that of existing global land cover datasets. The total mapped shrubland area is approximately 427,643 km2, exhibiting a clear latitudinal peak (30°–50°N) and multimodal longitudinal distribution pattern. In different biomes, climatic conditions—moisture or temperature—regulate the optimal phenological windows by driving functional trait divergence between shrubland and grassland. Background shrubland cover strongly determines identification accuracy. When shrubland coverage exceeds 60%, mapping accuracy shifts from “detectable” to “reliable”. Below this threshold, classification accuracy is limited by phenological noise and topography interference, whereas above it, canopy continuity enhances spectral separability and reduces terrain-related noise. This study demonstrates that shrub coverage, phenological timing, and terrain collectively regulate mapping accuracy. The phenology-optimized classification framework significantly outperforms existing common shrubland distribution datasets, especially in complex microtopography and transition zones. Improved shrubland mapping is critical for evaluating ecosystem health and investigating carbon cycling in arid regions."

 Retrieving granular information from large-scale geospatial databases is challenging and can require significant domain expertise, owing to complex data taxonomies and hierarchical data structures related to geometry and topology. In this research, a multi-agent system is developed that uses large language models (LLMs) for geospatial information retrieval based on natural language queries. The proposed solution employs LLMs within three agents that decompose data retrieval into sub-tasks: human instruction comprehension; data collection identification; and feature category screening. The three agents collaborate in a sequential workflow to accumulate knowledge and identify a pathway to the correct information within a hierarchical data structure. A data retrieval module subsequently interprets the search extent and retrieves data through API calls to the underlying databases. The proposed approach is evaluated in a case study with a large and complex geospatial database, the National Geographic Database operated by Ordnance Survey in the UK. Evaluation was based on a total of 83 sample queries, i.e. 40 human queries collected from volunteers, 40 synthetic queries generated by LLM, and 3 queries selected from a benchmark database. The proposed system answered majority of the queries successfully, namely 22 out of the 31 valid human queries, 29 out of 37 effective synthetic queries, and all 3 queries from the benchmark dataset. This demonstrates good potential for flexible data retrieval, locating a variety of geographical features from different data collections in response to natural language questions about tennis courts, public car parks, and restaurants, etc. The multi-agent solution was also evaluated using OpenStreetMap and the results demonstrate the transferability of the proposed method in handling different data taxonomies and structures. Our findings also highlight several research challenges around the “AI readiness” of documentation, complex geospatial data taxonomies, ambiguity in human language, and complex spatial reasoning. Overall, our study addresses two major research gaps: (1) the use of unstructured natural language to accurately retrieve geospatial information; and (2) the use of LLMs to navigate multiple heterogeneous datasets in a hierarchical data taxonomy."

 Beach slope is a fundamental morphometric parameter governing coastal dynamics, wave dissipation, and shoreline stability, and serves as a key basis for coastal hazard prediction, wave runup and overtopping assessment, and the design of coastal engineering structures. However, due to the limited spatial coverage and high costs of conventional monitoring techniques, no high-resolution, national-scale dataset of beach slopes has previously been available for China until now. In this study, we develop an automated and transferable framework for deriving beach slopes from ICESat-2 ATL03 photon data and produce the first systematic national-scale dataset of China’s sandy beach slopes. The workflow integrates (1) data preprocessing, including shoreline-orthogonal correction of ICESat-2 ground tracks, vertical datum harmonization to EGM2008, and selection of high-confidence photons (confidence ≥ 2); (2) adaptive photon clustering based on an OPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure) algorithm coupled with a moving-window filter for accurate beach photon extraction; and (3) slope inversion using low-order Fourier polynomial delineation of the foreshore combined with robust linear regression. The resulting dataset encompasses 688 along-track profiles covering 243 sandy beaches along China’s coastline. Validation against high-precision reference data, including RTK-GNSS surveys and DEM-derived slopes, yielded strong agreement (RMSE = 0.012, R2 = 0.89), demonstrating the reliability of the proposed method across diverse geomorphic settings. Spatially, the results reveal a distinct north–south attenuation pattern, with steeper, more variable slopes in temperate northern coasts and gentler, low-gradient beaches in the tropical south.

 Salt inhalation therapies in salt rooms are increasingly popular for prevention and as complementary therapy for individuals with impaired respiratory conditions. “Active” salt rooms apply devices that disperse dry sodium chloride aerosol or nebulized saline into the indoor air, while “passive” salt rooms contain large amounts of salt. However, their therapeutic efficacy remains controversial, and general operating standards are lacking. This study aimed to (i) survey environmental conditions in kindergartens’ salt rooms using a standardized checklist; (ii) investigate indoor air quality during operation; and (iii) identify common problems related to their operation. In our national survey, salt rooms were reported in 500 out of 3372 inspected kindergartens in Hungary. Most of these spaces were characterized by high occupant density and poor ventilation. Air quality was measured in 19 salt rooms. Salt particle concentrations were significantly higher in “active” salt rooms compared to “passive” ones. The maximum carbon dioxide concentration exceeded 1500 ppm during therapy sessions in most rooms. In all cases, the indoor airborne concentration of bacteria significantly exceeded outdoor levels, with a median indoor/outdoor concentration ratio of 48.7. In 7 out of 19 rooms, the concentration of fungi was also above the threshold level. In conclusion, salt rooms can potentially serve as sources of illness and infection due to inadequate indoor air quality. Therefore, the use of individual inhalers or nebulizers is recommended when medically indicated."

 This study investigates particulate matter pollution pathways in the industrial corridor of Durgapur and Asansol-Raniganj in the state of West Bengal in eastern Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), a region lacking long-term monitoring and requiring airshed-based management strategies due to prominent transboundary influences. We measured time integrated PM2.5 and PM10 at eight land-use specific sites, over a 15-month period from Oct 2022 to Dec 2023 - one of the first such efforts in this region. The annual PM2.5 concentrations ranged from 86 ± 48 to 171 ± 105 μg m−3, and PM10 from 144 ± 64 to 310 ± 189 μg m−3, with lowest concentration observed in SNT-BG and highest in RG-IND. The concentration peaked in winter, 193 ± 61 μg m−3 and 317 ± 73 μg m−3 for PM2.5 and PM10, respectively; driven by stagnant meteorology and reduced boundary layer height (∼396m). In contrast, the lowest concentrations were observed during the monsoon, 55 ± 29 μg m−3 and 100 ± 59 μg m−3 for PM2.5 and PM10, respectively, coinciding with intense rainfall (∼938 mm) and enhanced wet scavenging. Multiple linear regression revealed temperature and relative humidity as major inverse predictors of PM2.5. Concentration Weighted Trajectories (CWT) analyses identified the northwestern IGP, particularly Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, as dominant source regions during post-monsoon and winter. Conditional Bivariate Potential Function (CBPF) analysis indicated high local contributions from industrial clusters and traffic corridors. The health burden estimates 874 premature deaths per million population annually, more than 90% of which is attributed to cardio-pulmonary health end points. The high industrial influence and dominant transboundary contributions strongly support the adoption of an airshed-level management framework that integrates local emission controls and regional collaboration to sustainably improve air quality and health outcomes in eastern India's industrial cities."

 Accurate modeling of urban air pollution is essential for effective forecasting and regulatory strategies in complex environmental settings. This study proposes a novel framework for modeling the spatiotemporal dynamics of urban air pollution using a hybrid Graph Convolutional Network–Long Short-Term Memory (GCN–LSTM) architecture. The model captures temporal patterns of particulate matter (PM10) while addressing spatial relationships through a composite adjacency matrix that incorporates elevation, land cover, and Euclidean distance. Using Smart Seoul Data of Things (S-DoT) data, the GCN–LSTM model demonstrated superior interpolation accuracy compared to traditional LSTM and kriging models, highlighting its potential for complex urban environments. This framework lays the foundation for robust air quality forecasting and regulation in diverse, environmentally complex urban settings."

 Organic acids (OAs), crucial components of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), not only influence cloud condensation nuclei but also promote particle nucleation and growth. Elucidating the chemical composition and key sources of atmospheric OAs is therefore crucial, particularly in Central China, a region with agricultural and cooking practices. This study investigated the chemical characteristics and sources of PM2.5-bound OAs (C9-C32 monocarboxylic acids, C4-C10 dicarboxylic acids, 22 aromatic acids) in urban Changsha from August 2021 to January 2022. Results show that the quantified total OAs concentrations continuously increased from 362.2 ng/m3 in August to 894.1 ng/m3 in January. Chemically, hexadecanoic acid exhibited the highest average concentration (14.5% of quantified OAs), followed by p-Terephthalic acid (10.2%), octadecanoic acid (9.6%), succinic acid (9.1%), and azelaic acid (7.9%). Source apportionment revealed vehicle emissions as the predominant contributor (32.2% on average). Notably, biomass burning (24.8%) and cooking emissions (20.2%) also made substantial contributions. Particularly during October and November, biomass burning emission contributions surged to 32.2%, attributable to intensified open straw burning in October and residential firewood heating in surrounding suburban/rural areas in November. Even in August, with minimal agricultural burning and residential heating, biomass burning still contributed over 20%. A significant correlation (R2 = 0.90) exists between biomass burning and cooking emissions tracers in August, which features prevalent charbroiling cooking and concurrently explains the marked contribution of cooking emissions (25.0% on average). This study provides critical insights into the molecular composition and potential sources of OAs in Central China, highlighting the importance of biomass burning and cooking emissions in developing air-quality management strategies for this region."

 Based on in-situ precipitation observations, ERA5 reanalysis, and GDAS datasets, this study investigates water vapor transport and multiscale convergence characteristics during a typhoon-induced heavy rainfall (TIHR) event impacted by the binary tropical cyclones (BTCs) Lupit (2109) and Mirinae (2110) in eastern Fujian, China, from 5 to 6 August 2021. Under the control of the subtropical high, BTCs move slowly, and the southwest monsoon provides abundant water vapor for both BTCs and the heavy rainfall area. Based on methods from both Eulerian and Lagrangian viewpoints, the multi-scale characteristics of water vapor transport at three different stages during the prolonged maintenance of Lupit are quantitatively analyzed and compared. It is found out that the evolution of water vapor distributions clearly reveals the possible dominant reasons for the intensity and location of remote precipitations. The southwest monsoon serves as the primary moisture source, with its transport pathways strongly modulated by the relative positioning of the BTCs. Lupit plays a dominant role in guiding moisture into the precipitating area, whereas Mirinae, although geographically nearby, is located downstream and contributes limited moisture transport to Lupit and the remote precipitation. Decomposition of water vapor flux divergence shows that that the moisture advection by divergent winds (Qv_S) provides a more accurate indication of rainfall centers than the total water vapor flux divergence (Qv_all) poorly, particularly under the influence of complex terrain and multiple interacting systems. Furthermore, HYSPLIT trajectory analysis confirms that two branches of southwest monsoon water vapor transport contribute 78.74% of the total water vapor, while the direct contribution from Mirinae accounted for only 6.56%. These findings underscore the critical role of cyclone-relative positioning in shaping moisture pathways and remote precipitating intensities, thereby may help to better understand the complicated physical mechanisms of moisture transport in rainstorms impacted by BTCs and other atmospheric systems."
