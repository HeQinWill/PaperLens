Multiple models are applied to attribute to changes in anthropogenic emissions and climate. The results highlight that increases in anthropogenic emissions are the primary driver of ozone increases both in the free troposphere and at the surface. 
 We apply a statistical model, two machine learning models, and three chemical transport models to attribute the observed ozone increases over East and Southeast Asia (ESEA) to changes in anthropogenic emissions and climate. Despite variations in model capabilities and emission inventories, all chemical transport models agree that increases in anthropogenic emission are a primary driver of ozone increases in 1995–2019. The models attribute 53 %–59 % of the increase in tropospheric ozone burden over ESEA to changes in anthropogenic emissions, with emission within ESEA contributing by 66 %–77 %. South Asia has increasing contribution to ozone increases over ESEA. At the surface, the models attribute 69 %–75 % of the ozone increase in 1995–2019 to changes in anthropogenic emissions. Climate change also contributes substantially to the increase in summertime tropospheric (41 %–47 %) and surface ozone (25 %–31 %). We find that emission reductions in China since 2013 have led to contrasting responses in ozone levels in the troposphere (decrease) and at the surface (increase). From 2013 to 2019, the ensemble mean derived from multiple models estimate that 66 % and 56 % of the summertime surface ozone enhancement in the North China Plain and the Yangtze River Delta could be attributed to changes in anthropogenic emissions, respectively, with the remaining attributed to meteorological factors. In contrast, changes in anthropogenic emissions dominate summertime ozone increase in the Pearl River Delta and Sichuan Basin (91 %–95 %). Our study underscores the need for long-term observational data, improved emission inventories, and advanced modeling frameworks to better understand the mechanisms of ozone increases in ESEA."
10.5194/acp-25-8029-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了青藏高原热力强迫对流层和平流层之间臭氧输送年际变化的影响。论文发现，青藏高原中部和东部的热力强迫正异常对亚洲地区西风急流的南北分支产生相反的影响，从而影响臭氧的输送。此外，青藏高原西部的热力强迫正异常与亚洲地区西部臭氧输送增强和东部臭氧输送减弱有关。这项研究揭示了青藏高原热力强迫对臭氧输送年际变化的独特影响，为理解青藏高原对大气环境的影响提供了新的视角。虽然该论文没有直接提及遥感技术或卫星观测，但它对大气成分（尤其是臭氧）的研究，以及对影响臭氧分布和输送过程的分析，与大气环境遥感技术在空气质量监测和大气成分分析方面的应用密切相关。,"['ozone', 'stratosphere-to-troposphere transport (STT)', 'Tibetan Plateau thermal forcing', 'atmospheric composition', 'air quality']",Qingjian Yang;Tianliang Zhao;Yongqing Bai;Kai Meng;Yuehan Luo;Zhijie Tian;Xiaoyun Sun;Weikang Fu;Kai Yang;Jun Hu,Distinct structures of interannual variations in stratosphere-to-troposphere ozone transport induced by the Tibetan Plateau thermal forcing,"This study reveals a unique driver of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) thermal forcing of the interannual variations in stratosphere-to-troposphere transport (STT) of ozone with diverse structures. Anomalous strong TP thermal forcing induces anticyclonic anomalies in the upper troposphere over the TP, which strengthens and attenuates the northern and southern branches of the westerly jet, intensifying (weakening) the westerly trough for more (fewer) tropopause folds of ozone STT over the East Asian region. 
 Stratosphere-to-troposphere transport (STT) is an essential natural source of tropospheric ozone. Focusing on the STT variations in late spring and early summer with frequent ozone STT over the Asian region, this study investigated the Tibetan Plateau (TP) thermal effect on the interannual STT variations with the meteorological data over 1980–2014. The distinct structures of interannual STT anomalies with the key areas of TP thermal forcing are identified through the 35-year climatological statistics. Positive anomalies of thermal forcing over the central and eastern TP exert opposing impacts on the increasing and decreasing ozone STT, respectively, along the northern and southern branches of the westerly jet around the TP. Such stronger TP thermal forcing induces anticyclonic anomalies in the upper troposphere over the TP and the surroundings, which strengthens and attenuates the northern and southern branches of the westerly jet, intensifying and weakening the westerly trough for more (fewer) tropopause folds of ozone STT over the East Asian region. Furthermore, the positive anomalies of thermal forcing over the western TP are related to the western enhancing and eastern declining STT over the Asian region. This study reveals the distinct structures of interannual variations in ozone STT induced by the TP thermal forcing, providing a new perspective for the TP effect on the atmospheric environment."

Determining which flight formed each contrail is a critical step to decreasing this impact. We introduce a dataset of synthetic contrail observations with known flight attributions that can be used to develop and assess geostationary-satellite-based contrail-to-flight attribution systems. We additionally introduce a new attribution algorithm and show that it outperforms previous methods. 
 Condensation trail (contrail) cirrus clouds cause a substantial fraction of aviation's climate impact. One proposed method for the mitigation of this impact involves modifying flight paths to avoid particular regions of the atmosphere that are conducive to the formation of persistent contrails, which can transform into contrail cirrus. Determining the success of such avoidance maneuvers can be achieved by ascertaining which flight formed each nearby contrail observed in satellite imagery. The same process can be used to assess the skill of contrail forecast models. The problem of contrail-to-flight attribution is complicated by several factors, such as the time required for a contrail to become visible in satellite imagery, high air traffic densities, and errors in wind data. Recent work has introduced automated algorithms for solving the attribution problem, but it lacks an evaluation against ground-truth data. In this work, we present a method for producing synthetic contrail detections with predetermined contrail-to-flight attributions that can be used to evaluate – or “benchmark” –  and improve such attribution algorithms. The resulting performance metrics can be employed to understand the implications of using these observational data in downstream tasks, such as forecast model evaluation and the analysis of contrail avoidance trials, although the metrics do not directly quantify real-world performance. We also introduce a novel, highly scalable contrail-to-flight attribution algorithm that leverages the characteristic compounding of error induced by simulating contrail advection using numerical weather models. The benchmark shows an improvement of approximately 25 % in precision versus previous contrail-to-flight attribution algorithms, without compromising recall."
10.5194/amt-18-3453-2025,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,该研究论文主要关注利用多种遥感测量数据，结合机器学习方法，来更准确地估算行星边界层高度（PBLHT）。论文通过整合来自不同遥感仪器的PBLHT估算值，并使用随机森林和LightGBM等机器学习模型进行训练，最终得到一个最佳估计的PBLHT。研究结果表明，这种方法能够显著提高PBLHT的估算精度，并能有效捕捉PBLHT的日变化和季节性变化。虽然论文没有直接提及空气质量监测或大气成分分析，但PBLHT是大气过程研究和数值模型模拟中的一个重要参数，对理解大气污染物的扩散和传输具有重要意义。此外，论文中使用的遥感技术，如激光雷达和辐射干涉仪，也常用于大气环境遥感领域。,"['planetary boundary layer height', 'remote sensing', 'machine learning', 'radiosonde', 'Doppler lidar', 'micropulse lidar', 'Raman lidar', 'atmospheric emitted radiance interferometer', 'atmospheric process studies']",Damao Zhang;Jennifer Comstock;Chitra Sivaraman;Kefei Mo;Raghavendra Krishnamurthy;Jingjing Tian;Tianning Su;Zhanqing Li;Natalia Roldán-Henao,Best estimate of the planetary boundary layer height from multiple remote sensing measurements,"Planetary boundary layer height (PBLHT) is an important parameter in atmospheric process studies and numerical model simulations. We use machine learning methods to produce a best-estimate planetary boundary layer height (PBLHT-BE-ML) by integrating four PBLHT estimates derived from remote sensing measurements. We demonstrated that PBLHT-BE-ML greatly improved the comparisons against sounding-derived PBLHT. 
 Remote sensing measurements have been widely used to estimate the planetary boundary layer height (PBLHT). Each remote sensing approach offers unique strengths and faces different limitations. In this study, we use machine learning (ML) methods to produce a best-estimate PBLHT (PBLHT-BE-ML) by integrating four PBLHT estimates derived from remote sensing measurements at the Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) observatory. Three ML models – random forest (RF) classifier, RF regressor, and light gradient-boosting machine (LightGBM) – were trained on a dataset from 2017 to 2023 that included radiosonde, various remote sensing PBLHT estimates, and atmospheric meteorological conditions. Evaluations indicated that PBLHT-BE-ML from all three models improved alignment with the PBLHT derived from radiosonde data (PBLHT-SONDE), with LightGBM demonstrating the highest accuracy under both stable and unstable boundary layer conditions. Feature analysis revealed that the most influential input features at the SGP site were the PBLHT estimates derived from (a) potential temperature profiles retrieved using Raman lidar (RL) and atmospheric emitted radiance interferometer (AERI) measurements (PBLHT-THERMO), (b) vertical velocity variance profiles from Doppler lidar (PBLHT-DL), and (c) aerosol backscatter profiles from micropulse lidar (PBLHT-MPL). The trained models were then used to predict PBLHT-BE-ML at a temporal resolution of 10 min, effectively capturing the diurnal evolution of PBLHT and its significant seasonal variations, with the largest diurnal variation observed over summer at the SGP site. We applied these trained models to data from the ARM Eastern Pacific Cloud Aerosol Precipitation Experiment (EPCAPE) field campaign (EPC), where the PBLHT-BE-ML, particularly with the LightGBM model, demonstrated improved accuracy against PBLHT-SONDE. Analyses of model performance at both the SGP and EPC sites suggest that expanding the training dataset to include various surface types, such as ocean and ice-covered areas, could further enhance ML model performance for PBLHT estimation across varied geographic regions."

Our study introduces the T-Bird, an aircraft-towed platform designed to measure turbulence and aerosol properties at extremely low altitudes. Traditional aircraft cannot access this region, making the T-Bird a breakthrough for capturing critical atmospheric data. Its first deployment over the Arctic demonstrated its potential to improve our understanding of polar processes. 
 This study introduces the T-Bird, a novel aircraft-towed platform developed to measure aerosol and turbulence properties close to the surface, particularly over sea ice and open water in the polar regions. The T-Bird, towed by the Alfred Wegener Institute's Polar aircraft, offers a unique capability to capture data from altitudes as low as 10 m while the aircraft operates at its lowest allowed operation altitude. This measurement platform allows for simultaneous data collection of aerosol, turbulence, and meteorological parameters across multiple vertical layers. The T-Bird is equipped with specialized aerosol instrumentation to assess particle number concentration, number size distribution, and absorption coefficient and to collect filter samples. It has been tested under Arctic conditions during the BACSAM (Boundary layer and Aerosol and Cloud Study in the Arctic, based on aircraft and T-Bird Measurements) campaign in October 2022. This paper provides technical details on the T-Bird's design, with special focus on the aerosol instrumentation and its performance during Arctic flights addressing measurement challenges in the lowermost atmosphere. The first measurements demonstrate its potential to enhance our understanding of aerosol dynamics and atmospheric boundary layer processes in remote environments."

Its reaction with dihydroxybenzenes drives the formation of light-absorbing products. This study systematically investigates the formation of colored organic compounds from catechol precursors catalyzed by iron, with a focus on the role of iron oxidation state, UV light, and the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at acidic conditions (pH 3). In the presence of Fe(III) in the dark, light-absorbing, greyish-black, insoluble particles were formed. UV light reduced their formation, while H2O2 inhibited the formation completely. However, the presence of H2O2 led to a colored, strongly light-absorbing solution in both Fe(II) and Fe(III) experiments. Fe(II)-based experiments required UV light for the formation of those greyish-black particles. These findings emphasize the significant impact of soluble iron in forming light-absorbing compounds under varying conditions, highlighting its potential influence on the Earth’s radiation budget."
10.1029/2025GL116525,True,Geophysical Research Letters,该研究论文主要探讨了平流层极地涡旋对热带和中纬度火山气溶胶传输的不同控制作用。通过卫星观测和气候模型模拟，研究发现近二十年来中等火山爆发和极端野火对全球平流层气溶胶载荷产生了持续扰动，并且这些事件贡献了过去二十年南极平流层气溶胶负荷的约67%。研究还发现，热带地区的火山喷发对南极平流层气溶胶负荷的依赖性很强，极地涡旋强度较弱时，极地方向的传输会增强，而极地涡旋强度较强时，则会形成显著的传输屏障。与热带火山喷发不同，中纬度地区的火山喷发表现出季节依赖性：南半球夏季的喷发会导致喷发后第一个十月南极气溶胶负荷较高，而冬季的喷发会导致第二年十月的气溶胶负荷升高。这些发现对于减少潜在的平流层气溶胶注入策略中南极臭氧消耗风险具有重要意义。,"['stratospheric aerosol', 'satellite observations', 'polar vortex', 'Antarctic ozone depletion', 'volcanic eruption', 'wildfires', 'atmospheric composition', 'aerosol transport']",Yifeng Peng;Wenshou Tian;Cheng‐Cheng Liu;Pengfei Yu,Stratospheric Polar Vortex Exerts Different Controls on the Transport of Tropical and Mid‐Latitude Volcanic Aerosols,"Moderate volcanic eruptions and extreme wildfires in recent two decades have persistently perturbed global stratospheric aerosol loadings. Based on satellite observations and climate model simulations, we find that these events contribute to ∼67% of Antarctic stratospheric aerosol burden averaged over the last two decades. Our modeled analysis of hypothetical eruptions reveals distinct transport pathways controlled by injection location, season, and polar vortex conditions. For tropical injections, Antarctic stratospheric aerosol loading exhibits strong dependence on interannual polar vortex strength, with enhanced poleward transport during weak vortex years and significant transport barriers during strong vortex periods. Unlike tropical eruptions, mid‐latitude eruptions exhibit season‐dependent characteristics: austral summer injections cause high Antarctic aerosol loadings in the first October following injections, whereas winter injections lead to elevated second‐year October aerosol burdens. These findings on how polar vortex modulates aerosol transport provide important insights for minimizing Antarctic ozone depletion risks in potential stratospheric aerosol injection strategies."

Here the authors use satellite data to assess emissions from high-emitting landfills and find that transforming open sites to sanitary landfills could offer a large mitigation potential. 
 Solid waste in landfills continuously emits methane, which has become the third-largest anthropogenic source of methane emissions globally. The methane emissions from landfills exhibit substantial variability due to factors such as waste management practices and climatic conditions. Here we assessed methane emissions from 102 high-emitting landfills worldwide under different management strategies and climate conditions using 5 years of satellite observations. We find that, for these sites, total methane emissions from open dumps are underestimated by a factor of 5.3 ± 0.3 in the EDGAR v8.0 inventory. Transforming open dumpsites worldwide into sanitary landfills, while diverting organic waste to composters and biodigesters, can decrease methane emissions by 80% (60–89%), offering a mitigation potential of 760 (570–850) Mt CO2e annually. These results highlight that prioritizing improved waste management in developing countries, supported by economic and technological measures, represents one of the most effective strategies for mitigating methane emissions from the solid waste sector. Solid waste disposal is a major source of anthropogenic methane, yet estimating these emissions is difficult. Here the authors use satellite data to assess emissions from high-emitting landfills and find that transforming open sites to sanitary landfills could offer a large mitigation potential."

 42-years of Arctic and Antarctic Surface Temperatures from thermal Infrared satellite radiometers (AASTI) are presented as the Copernicus Climate Change Service Ice surface temperature record v1.1 dataset (C3S IST). It covers snow, ice and ocean surfaces with mean and max–min daily temperatures poleward of 50 degrees North and South, for the period 1982–2023. The C3S IST is provided as a Level 3 (L3) dataset in a polar 0.25 ° latitude and longitude grid. It consists of two parts: (1) the C3S IST climate data record (ISTCDR v1.1), covering the period 1. January 1982 to 30. June 2019, and (2) the C3S IST Interim CDR version 1.1 (ICDR v1.1) covering 1. July 2019 to 31. December 2023. The surface temperatures (STs) are calculated from satellite thermal infrared Brightness Temperature (TB) measurements from the Global Area Coverage – Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (GAC - AVHRR) data, creating a comprehensive data set based solely on a single sensor type. The underlying AASTI algorithm is a combination of algorithms specifically tuned for sea ice, marginal ice zone, land ice and high latitude open water. In addition, each of the algorithm coefficients are tuned specifically for each of the AVHRR instruments, using simulated Top of the atmosphere (TOA) TBs and ERA-Interim reanalysis surface and atmosphere data. Simulated TOA TB’s are computed using the community radiative transfer model, RTTOV v12.3. Spatially and temporally varying uncertainties are computed for each data-point. The C3S IST surface temperatures were validated against different in situ observation types, where comparison against radiometric temperatures from flight campaigns and ice sheet station data resulted in smaller mean differences of 0.20°C and -1.84°C in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) than for validations against met station air temperatures, which were usually 1–3°C higher. Surface temperature climatology and trends have been computed for sea ice and ice sheets, showing large regional differences in surface temperature trends within the NH. For the entire dataset, the average trend is +1.11 °C/decade for the NH sea ice, +0.16 °C/decade for the Southern Hemisphere (SH) sea ice, +0.38 °C/decade for the Greenland ice sheet and -0.13 °C/decade for the Antarctic ice sheet. The positive trends are typically small during summer and larger during winter, e.g. in the Barents Sea, where trends exceed +0.3 °C/year in winter. Negative temperature trends are observed in some regions such as the Bering Strait’s ice edge. For Antarctic sea ice, the trends are generally smaller and statistically less significant than those in the NH. The trends of the ice sheet surface show a similar pattern, where the Greenland Ice Sheet has positive trends, which both are largest and most significant in the coastal areas. The Antarctic Ice Sheet has diverse trends and large areas have statistically non-significant trends, except for the negative temperature trend in the central, high altitude part of east Antarctica exceeding -0.5 °C/year."

 sThis study aimed to explore the link between hospitalizations due to RSV infection and factors such as climate and air quality among children in Guangzhou. We included RSV infection cases from January 2017 to October 2023 in a tertiary hospital in Guangzhou, China, and then collected daily meteorological data including air temperature and relative humidity as well as air pollutant data including PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, O3, and NO2. Finally, we established a distributional lag nonlinear model (DLNM) to investigate the association of hospitalization for RSV infection with meteorological factors and air quality. Of the 1922 reports of RSV infection collected, 96.31 % of the infections were under 5 years of age. Our study revealed a correlation between reductions in air temperature and relative humidity and the rise in hospitalizations due to RSV infection. With respect to air quality, high concentrations of PM2.5, O3, and NO2 increase the risk of RSV infection, with the relative risk increasing with pollutant concentration.

 To elucidate the impact of boundary-layer meteorology on persistent heavy haze pollution, we analyzed 2018–2019 observational data from a 255-m meteorological tower in Tianjin. The boundary-layer evolution demonstrated that during the pollution period, the nocturnal static stability significantly intensified, with a daily maximum averaging approximately 18 K/km, accompanied by a jet stream structure. During the dissipation period, the ventilation coefficient, mechanical turbulence, and turbulent kinetic energy values were 1.5–3 times those recorded during the pollution period. Regarding the turbulent motion states, the continuous accumulation of PM2.5 was accompanied by enhanced turbulent intermittency. Over 80 % of the turbulent motion was in an intermittent state at heavy pollution levels. During the pollution accumulation period, the turbulent intermittency was more intense in the lower atmosphere, implying a stronger turbulence barrier effect restraining the upward diffusion of surface pollutants. The substantial increase in static stability, which hindered downward momentum transmission, was an important cause for weakening mechanical turbulence and enhancing turbulent intermittency. The negative correlation between the boundary-layer height and PM2.5 concentrations did not apply universally. During the pollution accumulation phase, no significant correlation was observed between these two parameters, suggesting a possible more direct impact by other physical processes. Spectral analysis of a case study showed significantly correlated semi-diurnal periodic signals between surface pressure and PM2.5 concentrations during the pollution accumulation period. A 2 hPa pressure oscillation could cause a 40–50 μg/m3 variation in PM2.5, leading to bimodal peaks of PM2.5 concentrations at night and late morning."

Michael Volk;Franziska Weyland;Andreas Engel,Tracing elevated abundance of CH2Cl2 in the subarctic upper troposphere to the Asian Summer Monsoon,"The study investigates transport within the Asian Summer Monsoon, focusing on how CH2Cl2 reaches the subarctic tropopause region. Using data from the PHILEAS campaign in 2023, events with increased mixing ratios were detected. Their origin, the transport paths to the tropopause region, and the potential entry into the stratosphere were analyzed. The East Asian Summer Monsoon was identified as the main transport pathway, with only a small contribution to the stratosphere in the following days. 
 The Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM) is a seasonal weather pattern characterized by heavy rains and winds, mainly affecting South and Southeast Asia during the summer months. The deep convection within the ASM is an important transport process for pollutants from the planetary boundary layer up to the tropopause region. This study uses in situ observations of CH2Cl2 from the PHILEAS (Probing High Latitude Export of Air from the Asian Summer Monsoon)  aircraft campaign in late summer 2023 to examine the transport pathways and timescales for polluted air from the ASM to the extratropical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). CH2Cl2 mixing ratios of up to 300 ppt (≈ 500 % of the Northern Hemisphere background) were measured in the upper troposphere in the subarctic region. The three largest observed pollution events were analyzed with the help of the Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART, both in terms of their origin and their potential entry into the lower stratosphere. The results show that the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) is the key pathway for transporting uncontrolled short-lived chlorinated substances (Cl-VSLSs) into the tropopause region, which contributes to an increase in tropospheric background levels with the potential to enter the lower stratosphere. The transport analysis of elevated mixing ratios shown here suggests that transport to the upper troposphere in the subarctic region did not occur through transport into the Asian Summer Monsoon Anticyclone (ASMA) with subsequent eddy-shedding events but rather by large convective transport contributions from the EASM. The projected entry into the lower stratosphere in the following days amounts to a few percent, indicating that the direct influence of these particular events on the lower stratosphere is probably minor."

Turner;Maria P. Cadeddu;Julia M. Simonson;Timothy J. Wagner,Propagating information content: an example with advection,"When deriving a geophysical variable from remote sensors, the uncertainty and information content are critical. The latter quantify specifies what fraction of a real perturbation would be observed in the derived variable. This paper outlines, for the first time, a methodology for propagating the information content from multiple remote sensors into a derived product using horizontal advection as an example. 
 The mathematical algorithm to derive geophysical information from remote sensing observations is called a retrieval. The mathematics of many retrieval problems are ill-posed, and thus a priori information is used to help constrain the derived geophysical variable to realistic values. One quantity of interest, therefore, is the information content of the observation. Perfect information content in the observation would be achieved if the retrieval were able to capture any perturbation in the desired geophysical variable with the proper magnitude.Many new data products can be derived by combining geophysical variables retrieved from multiple different remote sensors. This paper explores, for the first time, how to derive the information content of these derived products. The approach uses traditional error propagation techniques to derive the uncertainty of the derived field twice, both when the observations are used in the retrieval and also when only the a priori information from each remote sensor is propagated. These two uncertainties are then used to provide an estimate of the information content of the derived geophysical variable.This study demonstrates how to propagate the uncertainties from six different instruments to provide the information content for water vapor and temperature advection.  A multi-month analysis demonstrates that, in a mean sense, the information content for temperature advection is nearly unity for all heights below 700 m while, the information content for water vapor advection is somewhat more variable but still larger than 0.6 in the convective boundary layer."

This model incorporates both anthropogenic emission inventories and online ecosystem fluxes. Simulation results for the main urban area in the Netherlands demonstrate the strong potential of DALES to improve CO2 emission modeling and to support mitigation strategies. 
 Developing effective global strategies for climate mitigation requires an independent assessment of the greenhouse gas emission inventory at the urban scale. In the framework of the Dutch Ruisdael Observatory infrastructure project, we have enhanced the Dutch Atmospheric Large-Eddy-Simulation (DALES) model to simulate carbon dioxide (CO2) plume emission and three-dimensional dispersion within the turbulent boundary layer. The unique ability to explicitly resolve turbulent structures a the hectometer resolution (100 m) makes DALES particularly suitable for detailed realistic simulations of both singular high-emitting point sources and urban emissions, aligning with the goals of Ruisdael Observatory. The model setup involves a high-resolution simulation (100 m × 100 m) covering the main urban area of the Netherlands (51.5–52.5° N, 3.75–6.45° E). The model integrates meteorological forcing from the HARMONIE-AROME weather forecasting model, background CO2 levels from the CAMS reanalysis, and point source emissions and downscaled area emissions derived from the 1 km × 1 km emission inventory from the national registry. The latter are prepared using a sector-specific downscaling workflow, covering major emission categories. Biogenic CO2 exchanges from grasslands and forests are interactively included in the hectometer calculations within the heterogeneous land–surface model of DALES. Our evaluation strategy is twofold, comparing DALES simulations with (i) the state-of-the art LOTOS-EUROS model simulations and (ii) Ruisdael surface observations of the urban background in the Rotterdam area at Westmaas and Slufter and in situ rural Cabauw tower measurements. Our comprehensive statistical analysis confirmed the effectiveness of DALES at modeling the urban-scale CO2 emission distribution and plume dispersion under turbulent conditions but also revealed potential limitations and areas for further improvement. Thus, our new model framework provides valuable insights into the role of anthropogenic and biogenic contributions to local CO2 levels, as well as the transport and dispersion of CO2 emissions. This supports emission uncertainty reduction using atmospheric measurements and contributes to the development of effective regional climate mitigation strategies."

The hygroscopicity parameter κ is widely employed in cloud condensation nuclei size range to indirectly infer organic mass fraction (forg) based on the κ‐forg linear relationship, but its associated uncertainties in such applications, especially for sub‐10 nm particles have not been fully constrained. Here, we first discussed the uncertainties of κ values by revisiting closure studies of κ derived from chemical composition (κchem), hygroscopic growth factor (κgf), and effective supersaturation (κSe). We then conducted a modeling and experiment study of exemplary substances to discuss the uncertainties from the κ dependence on particle size and thermodynamic models. The model‐predicted κ of four representative substances demonstrated significant size‐dependence and were compared to measured values in 3–8 nm. For ammonium sulfate (AS), the deviations of κSe retrieved by commonly used models varied from 2.5% for 3 nm and 41.2% for 300 nm, demonstrating significant size‐dependence of model prediction deviations, which may potentially introduce significant uncertainties in determining chemistry. We further evaluated mixtures of AS and cis‐pinonic acid. The relative differences in forg for AS‐organic mixtures reached 20.7% (model effect) and 41.4% (size effect). The estimated κ of pure organic particle exhibited relative variations of 22.7% (model effect) and 83.3% (size effect). Our results highlight the importance of consistent thermodynamic parameterizations and size range in inferring chemical composition through hygroscopicity, and help to interpret κ values determined at different water vapor ratios and at different size ranges (especially sub‐10 nm range)."

 Geographical systems are inherently hierarchical, involving potential cross-scale interactions, as well as spatial dependencies and heterogeneities at each level of the geographic hierarchy. Capturing these interrelated effects within a unified model is essential for accurately reconstructing real-world spatiotemporal processes, yet remains a critical methodological challenge. Here we propose a novel Multi-Scale Spatio-temporal Statistical Modeling (M3SM) approach for analyzing spatio-temporal data with nested multi-scale structures. Built upon a multi-level modeling framework, M3SM naturally incorporates cross-scale interactions through appropriately designing randomly varying regression intercept and slope terms at multiple scales. Spatial dependencies and structured spatial heterogeneity at each spatial scale are captured using conditional autoregressive models, while temporal autoregressive processes capture stochastic dynamics. Despite its structural complexity, the implementation of M3SM is fully compatible with the established Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) computational ecosystem, enabling efficient approximate Bayesian inference. Simulation experiments confirm that M3SM can accurately recover spatial dependency and heterogeneity effects underlying true data generation processes. Applied to China’s air pollution data, M3SM identified significant effects of meteorological and anthropogenic factors. Crucially, it reveals that the effects of meteorological factors vary systematically across spatial scales—patterns that remain undetected unless spatial dependence and multi-scale structures are jointly modeled."

 To date, compared to traditional approaches to increasing crop yields, developing methods to mitigate ozone pollution has attracted less attention from policymakers toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) of Zero Hunger. In this study, using long-term model-simulated hourly ozone concentrations bias-corrected via machine learning, we estimated ozone-induced wheat production losses in China from 2005 to 2019. We further examined uncertainties in prior research arising from methodological variations and source-specific input fields. Four approaches – one concentration-based and three flux-based with different stomatal conductance formulations – were applied to evaluate the associated uncertainties within a unified modeling framework. Our results show that annual average production losses of wheat are 16.6–30.7 million metric tonnes (Mt yr−1) depending on the approach used, with nominal economic costs (ECs) amounting to 5.2–9.5 billion USD yr−1. National production losses of wheat exhibit an upward trend of +0.41–0.74 Mt yr−1 in parallel with rising wheat production. The annual nominal ECs show an upward trend ranging between +0.38 and + 0.69 billion USD yr−1, while inflation and exchange rate fluctuations exaggerate the trend of the real monetary losses by +0.17–0.39 billion USD yr−1 based on 2015 values. Henan, Shandong and Anhui provinces suffer the most severe losses with large volumes of wheat production. Among potential sources of uncertainty, fundamental methodological differences contribute the most to the combined large uncertainty. Particularly, inaccurate representation of regional crop genotypes and environmental conditions can lead to large biases regardless of the approach used. Therefore, future studies should prioritize approaches that incorporate regional specificity, such as refined model parameterization and dose-yield relationships. This study provides important scientific evidence that ozone pollution mitigation can greatly contribute to SDG 2, and offers valuable suggestions for further improving assessment approaches to enhance our understanding of air pollution impacts on food security."

 Identifying the key factors that influence atmospheric visibility is critical for effective air pollution prevention and control. However, the complex nonlinear relationships between visibility and its influencing factors pose significant challenges. Most current studies rely on empirical models for statistical analysis, which can introduce significant inaccuracies.This study integrates the traditional IMPROVE analysis method with machine learning models to investigate the driving factors of atmospheric visibility and the causes of low visibility events during the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou. The results indicate that SO42−, NO3−, organic aerosols (OA), and black carbon (BC) are the primary light extinction contributors among PM2.5 chemical components. Secondary formation processes were the dominant factor that accounted for 57 % of extinction coefficient, relative humidity and vehicles together contributed 30 % of extinction coefficient. During periods of low visibility (<10 km), the contributions of secondary nitrates and relative humidity content to extinction coefficient increased significantly, suggesting that hygroscopic growth of secondary nitrates was the primary driver of such events.The results of the study show that machine learning models closely match the IMPROVE approach during periods of low visibility. In addition, machine learning models outperform the IMPROVE method in their ability to capture the complex non-linear relationships between forcing factors and visibility. To effectively manage secondary nitrate pollution, it is critical to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ammonia (NH3) while improving overall air quality. This comprehensive analytical approach provides scientific evidence for improving urban atmospheric visibility."

However, emerging observational evidences reveal a notable alteration in the O3-temperature relationship under extremely heat conditions (referred to as O3 suppression) in 20%–30% cities of China, yet the underlying mechanisms and driving forces remain unclear. This study provides a comprehensive investigation of the meteorological mechanisms driving high-temperature O3 suppression in Eastern China, with particular emphasis on regional disparities between suppression and non-suppression areas. Our analysis revealed distinct spatial patterns of O3 suppression across major Chinese regions. The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Pearl River Delta (PRD) regions exhibit significant O3 suppression, with the O3-temperature relationship decreasing by 3–5 μg m−3 °C−1 at high temperatures. In contrast, the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) region rarely illustrates this phenomenon. Through integrated statistical analysis and machine learning approaches, we identified radiation, relative humidity (RH), and planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) as the key meteorological drivers. Mechanistic analysis demonstrated that RH was the dominant factor accounting for regional differences in O3 suppression, primarily owing to the contrasting effects of dry heat (BTH) and wet heat (YRD and PRD). PBLH emerged as a secondary influential factor that modulates O3 concentration through the competitive effects of diffusion and transport processes. Cluster analysis further revealed that the occurrence frequency of inhibitory meteorological conditions (high RH and low PBLH) during high-temperature days in the YRD and PRD regions (25%–35%) significantly exceeded that in the BTH region (2%). This study provides crucial insights into the regional disparities in meteorological mechanisms underlying high-temperature O3 suppression and offers valuable scientific support for region-specific O3 pollution control strategies in the context of climate warming and increasingly frequent heatwaves."

We investigated how different aerosols, such as sulfates, nitrates, and pollutants, influence the exchange of heat between the atmosphere and its surroundings. The results show that these particles can alter temperature patterns, especially during the Asian summer monsoon. This research improves our understanding of how human activities may affect regional climate. 
 This study aims to investigate the direct shortwave (SW) radiative forcing (RF) and heating rates of the Asian Tropopause Aerosol Layer (ATAL) in the upper troposphere–lower stratosphere (UTLS) using in situ observations from the Balloon measurement campaigns of the Asian Tropopause Aerosol Layer (BATAL) conducted between 2014 and 2018. Measurements were obtained over three distinct locations in India: Gadanki (13.48° N, 79.18° E), Hyderabad (17.47° N, 78.58° E), and Varanasi (25.27° N, 82.99° E). Given the ambiguity in the chemical composition of ATAL from several reported studies, seven different aerosol mixtures – comprising sulfate (SUL), nitrate (NIT), organic carbon (OC), and ammonium (AM) – were considered to assess their impact on estimates of ATAL radiative forcing and heating rates. A pronounced enhancement in aerosol backscatter was observed at ATAL altitudes (13 to 19 km) across all locations, with the backscatter ratio (BSR; at 455 nm) peaking at 1.07 over Varanasi and Hyderabad, followed by 1.06 over Gadanki. Radiative forcing estimates indicate a net warming effect, with ATAL contributing up to 3 % of the total columnar atmospheric forcing. Heating rates reveal a marked increase in aerosol-induced warming at ATAL altitudes, with maximum heating rates reaching 0.03 K d−1 across the study locations. The radiative impact of ATAL aerosols is highly sensitive to variations in the aerosol composition. Compared to a reference case with a stratospheric sulfate background, the ATAL radiative forcing varies between 0.03 and 0.28 W m−2 (1.5- to 14-fold increase). At the same time, heating rates exhibit a 30-fold increase, reaching 0.03 K d−1, depending on the aerosol mixture. Despite these strong localized effects within the UTLS, the overall contribution to total columnar aerosol forcing remains moderate (up to 5 %), underscoring the importance of aerosol composition in determining ATAL's radiative influence."

The increased amount of ozone enhances ozone radiative forcing. The ozone enhancement and associated radiative forcing are the highest over South and East Asia. The emissions of nitrous oxides show a higher influence on shifting ozone photochemical regimes than volatile organic compounds. 
 Ozone in the troposphere is a prominent pollutant whose production is sensitive to the emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Here, we assess the variation of tropospheric ozone levels, trends, ozone photochemical regimes and radiative effects using the ECHAM6–HAMMOZ chemistry–climate model for the period 1998–2019 and satellite measurements. The global mean simulated trend in tropospheric column ozone (TRCO) for the study period (1998–2019) is 0.89 ppb decade−1. During the overlapping period with Ozone Monitoring Instrument/Microwave Limb Sounder (OMI/MLS) observations (2005–2019), the simulated global mean TRCO trends (1.58 ppb decade−1) show fair agreement with OMI/MLS estimates (1.4 ppb decade−1). The simulations for doubling emissions of NOx (DoubNOx), VOCs (DoubVOC), and halving emissions of NOx (HalfNOx) and VOCs (HalfVOC) show nonlinear responses to ozone trends and tropospheric ozone photochemical regimes. The DoubNOx simulations show VOC-limited regimes over the Indo-Gangetic Plain, eastern China, western Europe and the eastern US, while HalfNOx simulations show NOx-limited regimes over North America and Asia. Emissions changes in NOx (DoubNOx/HalfNOx) influence the shift in tropospheric ozone photochemical regimes compared to VOCs (DoubVOC/HalfVOC).The estimated global mean TO3RE during 1998–2019 from the control (CTL) simulations is 1.21 W m−2. The global mean TO3RE shows enhancement by 0.36 W m−2 in DoubNOx simulations compared to CTL. While TO3RE shows a reduction in other simulations compared to CTL (DoubVOC: −0.005 W m−2, HalfNOx: −0.12 W m−2 and HalfVOC: −0.03 W m−2).

During warm periods, the model overestimated concentrations of OH and HO2, leading to overestimation of ozone and nitric acid production. Our findings highlight the need to better understand how OH and HO2 are formed and removed, which is important for accurate air quality and climate predictions. 
 HOx radicals (OH and HO2) are crucial oxidants that determine atmospheric oxidation capacity and the production of secondary pollutants; however, their sources and sinks remain incompletely understood in certain rural, forest, and maritime environments. This study measured HO2∗ (HO2 + contribution from RO2, organic peroxyl radicals) and OH concentrations using a chemical ionization mass spectrometer at a subtropical rural site in southern China from 12 November to 19 December 2022. The average peak concentrations were 3.50 ± 2.47 × 106 cm−3 for OH and 1.34 ± 0.93 × 108 cm−3 for HO2∗. Model-estimated contribution from RO2 to HO2 during the measurement period ranged from 44 % to 69 % of  HO2∗. Calculations based on an observation-constrained chemical model revealed an overestimation of HO2 and OH concentrations during warm periods of the field study. Sensitivity tests suggest that adding HOx sinks or an HO2 recycle process to the model could improve the model performance. Over-simulation of HOx in the model resulted in overestimations of midday (10:00–15:00 UTC) production rates by more than 79 % for ozone and a factor of 1.88 for nitric acid. Our study highlights the need for further improving understanding of the sources and sinks of OH and HO2 and representation of them in air quality models."

 Atmospheric black carbon can act as a short-lived climate forcer and carrier of toxic compounds. This work aims to utilize aerosol compositions detected by a soot-particle aerosol mass spectrometer to advance our understanding of the emission and atmospheric processing of refractory BC (rBC) in Singapore. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis of rBC and organic aerosols (OAs) (PMFbase) identified two traffic factors with differences in rBC content, coating thickness, and diurnal pattern, which could potentially help differentiate gasoline and diesel vehicular emissions. Additionally, two secondary OA (SOA) factors influenced by local chemistry and/or regional transport (less-oxidized oxygenated OA (LO-OOA) and more-oxidized OA (MO-OOA)) were identified. Including metals in the PMF (PMFmetal) improved the quality of source apportionment significantly. An industrial- and shipping-influenced OA separated from traffic emissions was strongly associated with heavy metals (e.g., V+ and Ni+) that might pose higher potential risks to human health. Two biomass burning OA (BBOA) factors with different degrees of oxygenation were also identified. Although the aged BBOA component was highly oxidized, its strong association with K3SO4- distinguished it from other background MO-OOAs, which generally lacked distinctive OA signatures. Integration of both metals and inorganic aerosols (IAs) into the PMF (PMFall) further identified an additional aged BBOA component that was associated with nighttime IAs and organo-nitrate formation. Furthermore, PMFall revealed concurrent LO-OOA and nitrate formation during daytime, whereas photochemical production of MO-OOAs was linked to acidic sulfate formation, indicating the importance of investigating the interaction between SOA and IA formation and their mixing state in complex city environments."

A reference table is provided for attributing the PTR signal to contributing VOC species. The signals are grouped according to the complexity of their potential identities. We find that a number of signal ions such as C6H7+ for benzene and C5H9+ for isoprene merely give an upper limit of their corresponding concentrations. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are important atmospheric components that contribute to air pollution, but their accurate quantification by proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) remains challenging. In this work, we coupled a gas chromatograph (GC) prior to PTR-MS and analyzed complex ambient air in urban Shanghai to speciate the PTR signal to identify the VOC species that were responsible for the generation of the ions detected by PTR. We classified 176 individual PTR signals with associated compounds resolved by the GC based on whether they could be used to quantify a VOC species without pre-separation. In this classification, Category I includes 45 decent signal ions that were produced from a single VOC species and thus can be used for reliable quantification, although some of the Category I ions are not the conventionally used protonated quasi-molecular ions (MH+). Category II includes 39 signal ions that were produced from a group of isomers and can be used to quantify the isomeric sum, but with an increased uncertainty if a single calibration factor for one specific isomer is used to represent all structures. Category III includes 92 signal ions that were generated from more than one non-isomeric species (e.g., through protonation, fragmentation, cluster formation) and thus merely gave an upper limit of VOC concentrations. In addition, we propose taking aromatic compounds, for instance, the quantification of selected VOCs, utilizing either non-MH+ or non-Category I ions. Our results help to achieve more comprehensive species identification and reliable VOC quantification in PTR measurements."

 We introduce the optimized dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) algorithm for constructing an adaptive and computationally efficient reduced-order model and forecasting tool for global atmospheric chemistry dynamics. By exploiting a low-dimensional set of global spatio-temporal modes, interpretable characterizations of the underlying spatial and temporal scales can be computed. Forecasting is also achieved with a linear model that uses a linear superposition of the dominant spatio-temporal features. The DMD method is demonstrated on 3 months of global chemistry dynamics data, showing its significant performance in terms of computational speed and interpretability. We show that the presented decomposition method successfully extracts and forecasts chemical patterns for leading chemical indicators, including nitric oxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, hydroxyl radical, isoprene, and carbon monoxide. Moreover, the DMD algorithm allows for rapid reconstruction of the underlying linear model, which can then easily accommodate non-stationary data and changes in the dynamics."

Vardag;André Butz,pyVPRM: a next-generation vegetation photosynthesis  and respiration model for the post-MODIS era,"The Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model (VPRM) estimates carbon exchange between the atmosphere and biosphere by modeling gross primary production and respiration using satellite data and weather variables. Our new version, pyVPRM, supports diverse satellite products like Sentinel-2, MODIS, VIIRS, and new land cover maps, enabling high spatial and temporal resolution. This improves flux estimates, especially in complex landscapes, and ensures continuity as MODIS nears decommissioning. 
 The Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model (VPRM) is a well-established tool for estimating carbon exchange fluxes between the atmosphere and the biosphere. The gross primary production (GPP) and respiration (Reco) of the ecosystem are modeled separately at high spatial and temporal resolution using the satellite-derived enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and land surface water index (LSWI), as well as meteorological variables for solar irradiance and surface temperature. The net ecosystem exchange (NEE) is calculated as the difference between the gross flux GPP and respiration. VPRM is widely used as a biospheric flux model in atmospheric transport modeling, most often on scales ranging from city to continent, but also in studies of biospheric carbon budgets and their changes with climate extremes. Historically, satellite-based surface reflectances from the 500 m resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) have been used to determine the EVI and LSWI. However, MODIS is reaching the end of its lifetime and will soon be decommissioned. Therefore, we present an updated version of VPRM, pyVPRM, which provides a software framework with a modular structure that can be used with various satellite products, land cover maps, meteorological data sources, and VPRM model parameterizations. Our tool naturally provides an interface to use satellite data from Sentinel-2, MODIS, and VIIRS, as well as global high-resolution land cover classification maps from the Copernicus Dynamic Land Cover Collection 3 and ESA WorldCover at 100 and 10 m resolution, respectively. Neither product is static; hence, dynamic changes of the land cover from year to year can be represented. Using Sentinel-2, ecosystem fluxes can be calculated at a resolution of up to 20 m, providing more accurate flux estimates in heterogeneous landscapes like croplands and making it possible to resolve small-scale vegetation patches common in urban areas. In contrast, VIIRS data are at the same resolution as MODIS and thus can provide continuity once MODIS is discontinued, requiring only minor adjustments to the VPRM data preprocessing. In addition, pyVPRM improves the data handling, for example, for snow-covered scenes. This paper presents the pyVPRM framework, discusses changes and improvements compared to previous VPRM implementations, and provides VPRM parameters for the European domain based on indices calculated from MODIS, Sentinel-2, and VIIRS using a new selection of eddy-covariance observations from 97 flux tower sites. Using pyVPRM and the new parameters, we observe significant improvements in the estimation of the European carbon budget. The results conform well with those from inversion studies."

Epidemiological studies that assess these effects need daily, fire-specific ground-level PM2.5 data, and missing emission information can lead to underestimates. This paper presents a method to estimate daily fire-specific PM2.5 smoke concentrations in the western United States from 2007 to 2019. Our model uses fire characteristics (e.g., fuel type, fire size, and distance) and updated fire emission inputs in an atmospheric dispersion model to simulate where smoke travels and at what concentration. We then apply a Bayesian time-series model to ground-based EPA monitors to isolate the smoke-specific portion of total PM2.5, accounting for meteorology and season. This approach allows us to assess spatial variation in smoke exposure and investigate the role of fire attributes. For example, Lindon, UT experienced 398 fires with modest average concentrations (∼2 μg m3), while Carson City, NV saw fewer fires (177) but more intense exposures (∼6 μg m3, max 159 μg m3). These contrasts highlight the value of linking fire characteristics to daily exposure in health studies and underscore the need to consider transported smoke in fire management strategies."

We first assess how well the DYAMOND models reproduce precipitation intensity (Ṗ $\dot{P}$) relative to observations of the Integrated MultisatellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement, as well as cloud water paths (CWP) relative to the ERA5 reanalysis. Both Ṗ $\dot{P}$ and CWP differences vary greatly between the models. We then look at the ratio of these fields in a recently defined index of precipitation efficiency (PE) (ϵ ${\epsilon}$), which is straightforward both to calculate from 2D output and to compare to satellite observations. Moderate rainfall events have greater spatial variability in and lower values of ϵ ${\epsilon}$ than intense events for all models. Oceanic ϵ ${\epsilon}$ also tends to be greater than or equal to continental values in the models. We then phase partition ϵ ${\epsilon}$ using the ice water path (ϵi ${{\epsilon}}_{i}$) and the liquid water path (ϵw ${{\epsilon}}_{w}$) to understand which phases drive these behaviors in ϵ ${\epsilon}$. While the mean value and land‐ocean contrast of ϵ ${\epsilon}$ correlate well with ϵw ${{\epsilon}}_{w}$, its spread and intermodel variability during intense events are driven by ϵi ${{\epsilon}}_{i}$. Lastly, we consider the sensitivity of ϵ ${\epsilon}$ to averaging timescales, as well as its variability over timescales in power spectra, and find that the models tend to underestimate the variability of ϵ ${\epsilon}$ at higher frequencies. These analyses indicate that explicit deep convection is insufficient to generate consistent ϵ ${\epsilon}$ and that both cloud microphysics and subdaily precipitation phenomena like mesoscale convective systems contribute to persistent intermodel variations in ϵ ${\epsilon}$."

This study presents a first comprehensive analysis of 2‐years (June 2019–May 2021) of surface radiative fluxes in distinct sky conditions (clear, cloudy, and rainy) at Manora Peak (79.45°E, 29.35°N) in the central Himalayas. We examined shortwave (Sdn: downward and Sup: upward) and longwave (Ldn: downward and Lup: upward) flux components at monthly, daily, and seasonal scales. Ldn was found significantly higher on cloudy days than clear skies, with seasonal increases of 9.94% (summer‐monsoon), 15.29% (autumn), 9.38% (winter), and 10.28% (spring). On rainy days, these values were more pronounced, reaching 12.47%, 24.76%, 19.22%, and 11.58% respectively. Atmospheric transmissivity (τ) peaks (∼0.8) during day hours, and surface albedo (α) rises (∼0.7) at sunset under clear skies. We evaluated various parameterization schemes for Ldn, identifying Herrero‐Polo‐2012 as best for clear (R2 ∼0.89, RMSE ∼11.24 W m−2), while Kimball—1982 and Unsworth—1975 as optimal for cloudy (R2 ∼0.79, RMSE ∼22.93 W m−2) and rainy (R2 ∼0.82, RMSE ∼16.73 W m−2) conditions, respectively. Further, we applied an advanced XGBoost machine learning algorithm to predict Ldn, achieving superior performance to traditional schemes under various sky conditions (clear: R2 ∼0.91, RMSE ∼9.7 W m−2; cloudy: R2 ∼0.89, RMSE ∼ 12.00 W m−2; and rainy: R2 ∼0.91, RMSE ∼11.70 W m−2), highlighting the potential of ML‐based emulators over complex terrain."

Total OH reactivity (k′OH) and total peroxyl radicals (RO2* = RO2 + HO2) play an important role in this cycle and have a major impact on O3 mitigation. The currently used atmospheric models generally underestimate the measured values of k′OH and RO2* concentrations, therefore the ozone production processes remains unclear. This paper presents observation of k′OH, RO2*, and ancillary trace species from February and March 2022 in Beijing, covering the 24th Olympic Winter Games period. We aim to accurately predict the ozone production processes by exploring the impact of k′OH on the RO2* chemistry. During the Games period, observed k′OH were significantly higher than calculations, and average RO2* concentrations at noontime of 6.9 pptv were observed, which is about 1.3–10 times higher than previous winter observations. A zero‐dimensional model underestimated the observed RO2*. Constraining k′OH to the measured value by introducing the oxidation chemistry of unknown or unmeasured volatile organic compounds (VOCs) species (X) can effectively close the gap between modeled and measured RO2*. By considering measured k′OH and RO2*, the ozone production potential increased by a factor of 1.3–2.1, the O3 production regime sensitivity showed a significant trend shift from VOCs to NOx limited, and enhanced the absolute ozone production sensitivity on VOCs by an order of magnitude. This means that simultaneously measurement of k′OH and RO2* provides a more accurate approach to O3 control."

Quantification of regional transport to SO42− using chemical transport models (CTMs) is debated due to uncertainties in SO2 emissions and SO42− formation mechanisms incorporated in the CTMs. In this study, sulfur isotope ratios in sulfate (δ34S‐SO42−) were measured at Gucheng, a heavily polluted city in the NCP, to differentiate local emissions from regional transport to sulfate. The δ34S‐SO42− values varied from 2.5 to 6.5‰, with a mean of 4.6 ± 1.1‰. The lower δ34S‐SO42− values were observed in the haze events, attributed to regional transport from high‐SO2 emission regions, where coal materials typically exhibit declined δ34S values. The fractionation factors (α34Sg→p) of δ34S for SO2 to SO42− conversion were estimated to be 3.6 ± 1.1‰. Considering the α34Sg→p, the quantified formation mechanisms indicated that transition metallic ions (TMIs)‐catalyzed O2 oxidation dominated sulfate formation, contributing 34%, followed by NO2 (27%), OH (23%), and H2O2/O3 oxidation pathways (16%). Local coal burning, vehicle emissions, and oil combustion contributed 58%, 16%, and 9% to sulfate, respectively. The remaining 17% of sulfate was contributed by regional transport (mainly coal burning) with enhancements in the specific haze events. Although uncertainties remained in the estimations, our findings did suggest that strict control in SO2 emissions from local and regional coal combustion along with TMIs emissions from the steel industry was crucial for reducing sulfate concentrations in this NCP city."

It is largely influenced by local weather conditions and atmospheric transport, which are in turn controlled by large‐scale atmospheric circulation patterns. Because of the absence of long‐term atmospheric nitrogen deposition data series, the mechanisms of interannual variation of nitrogen deposition are still poorly understood. Here, we investigate relationships between atmospheric nitrogen deposition and atmospheric circulation variability and explore the underlying mechanisms. We find that there is a growing imbalance between regional nitrogen emissions and deposition in global hotspots. Atmospheric nitrogen deposition variations exhibit significant relationships with atmospheric circulation modes, with predominant influences from the El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Additionally, we captured significant nitrogen deposition anomalies during different phases of ENSO years by altering global temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric circulation.

Martin,Black carbon emissions generally underestimated in the global south as revealed by globally distributed measurements,"Using globally consistent measurements and high-resolution modelling, this study finds that black carbon emissions are generally underestimated in the Global South. 
 Characterizing black carbon (BC) on a fine scale globally is essential for understanding its climate and health impacts. However, sparse BC mass measurements in different parts of the world and coarse model resolution have inhibited evaluation of global BC emission inventories. Here, we apply globally distributed BC mass measurements from the Surface Particulate Matter Network (SPARTAN) and complementary measurement networks to evaluate contemporary BC emission inventories. We use a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) in its high-performance configuration (GCHP) for high-resolution simulations to relate BC emissions to ambient concentrations for comparison with measurements. Here we find that simulations using the Community Emissions Data System (CEDS) emission inventory exhibit skill (r2 = 0.73) in representing variability in SPARTAN measurements across primarily developed regions with low BC concentrations but exhibit pronounced discrepancy (r2 = 0.00019) across high-BC regions in the Global South, underestimating BC by 38%. Alternative inventories (EDGAR, HTAP) yield similar results. These findings motivate renewed attention to the challenging task of characterizing BC emissions from low- and middle-income countries. Using globally consistent measurements and high-resolution modelling, this study finds that black carbon emissions are generally underestimated in the Global South."

 Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are typically a mix of warmers/coolers and short-lived/long-lived species. This suite of emissions should be taken into account to drive better climate. We quantify 33 emitted species since 1750 from seven economic sectors and their impact on present-day warming. We then assess how today’s sectoral emissions impact future temperatures. Sectors that predominantly emit short-lived warmers drive half of today’s warming (~0.6 °C). However, their current-year emissions have a lesser impact on 100-year temperature projections due to proportionally lower longer-lived species. Sectoral emissions dominated by longer-lived warmers impact temperature for centuries – an impact which accumulates over time. However, shorter-lived climate coolers from these sectors mask ~50% of their present-day warming (~33% overall). This means actions necessary to reduce long-lived warming may temporarily increase near-term temperatures. Successfully limiting both near- and long-term warming requires considering this interplay and accelerating climate ambitions to offset any decline in coolers."

 The exchange of air masses between sea and land plays a crucial role in the migration and transformation of atmospheric pollutants in coastal regions. Due to the absence of in-situ technology for continuous monitoring of marine air pollutants, much of the current scientific understanding of that still lacks observational evidence. This study utilized data of ozone (O3) and its precursors obtained from satellite spectrum to investigate the distribution and transport of air pollutants between marine and terrestrial atmosphere in East Asia. The results indicate that the low tropospheric (0–5 km) O3 concentrations over the seas are comparable to those in coastal cities, with Bohai Bay having the highest concentration in East Asia, exceeding 33 DU (1 DU = 2.69 × 1016 molecules·cm−2). Meanwhile, through the observations of two Chinese satellites with different equator-crossing time, afternoon O3 concentrations over sea were significantly higher than in the morning, indicating high-level O3 over sea was mainly caused by local formation. The comparison of marine and terrestrial pixels shows that, under the same precursor concentrations, marine air exhibits a 3.7 % higher O3 production rate on average. The higher O3 production rate, combined with the substantial emissions of O3 precursors, ultimately leads to the Bohai Sea becoming an ‘O3 pool’. This study, for the first time based on satellite observations, captures the exchange process of O3 and its precursors between terrestrial and marine atmospheres: land-based precursors are transported to the sea, where O3 formed under suitable conditions and then transported back to land."

 The Aerosol Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project (AerChemMIP) was endorsed by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) and was designed to quantify the climate and air quality impacts of aerosols and chemically reactive gases. AerChemMIP  provided the first consistent calculation of effective radiative forcing (ERF) for a wide range of forcing agents, which was a vital contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It supported the quantification of composition–climate feedback parameters and the climate response to short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs), as well as enabled the future impacts of air pollution mitigation to be identified, and the study of interactions between climate and air quality in a transient simulations. Here we review AerChemMIP in detail and assess the project against its stated objectives, its contribution to the CMIP6 project, and  the wider scientific efforts designed to understand the role of aerosols and chemistry in the Earth system. We assess the successes of the project and the remaining challenges and gaps. We conclude with some recommendations that we hope will provide input to planning for future MIPs in this area. In particular, we highlight the necessity of sufficient ensemble size for the attribution of regional climate responses  and the need for coordination across projects to ensure key science questions are addressed.

Both satellites performed best in areas far from roads, where pollution is lower and more uniform. The newer TEMPO satellite, with hourly data, agreed most closely with monitors at midday and performed better than TROPOMI, a satellite with daily measurements. These findings highlight the ability of satellites to complement existing ground-based monitors. 
 In this study we assess the capability of current-generation satellites to capture the variability of near-surface nitrogen dioxide (NO2) monitoring data, with the goal of supporting health and regulatory applications. We consider NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) over the United States from two satellite instruments, the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) and Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO), and compare them with ground-based concentrations as measured by the EPA's Air Quality System (AQS) monitors. While TROPOMI provides a longer-term record of assessment (2019–2023), TEMPO informs diurnal patterns relevant to evaluating peak NO2. We analyze frequency distributions and quantify their similarity using the Jensen–Shannon divergence (JSD), where smaller values indicate better agreement. Satellite and ground monitor NO2 distributions are most similar at non-roadway monitors (JSD =0.008) and are most different at interstate (JSD = 0.158) and highway (JSD =0.095) monitors. Seasonal analysis shows the greatest similarity in distributions in winter (JSD =0.010) and the greatest difference in summer (JSD =0.035). Across seasons and monitor locations, the calculated 13:30 LT TEMPO consistently exhibits JSDs that are better than or comparable to TROPOMI (TEMPO: 0.005–0.151; TROPOMI: 0.012–0.265). TEMPO's agreement with monitors, in both December 2023 and July 2024, is found to be best around midday, with non-road monitors in July having the best alignment (JSD =0.008) at 16:00 UTC (≈11:00 LT). These findings highlight the ability of TROPOMI and TEMPO to complement existing ground-based monitors and demonstrate their potential for monitor siting, regulatory, and public health applications."

We deliberately released methane in different environments and calibrated the response of different methane analysers when they transected the plumes in a vehicle. We derived an improved statistical function for consistent emission estimations using different instruments. Repeated transects reduce the uncertainty in emission rate estimates. 
 Mobile real-time measurements of ambient methane provide a fast and effective method to identify and quantify methane leaks from local gas distribution systems in urban areas. The objectives of these methodologies are to (i) identify leak locations for repair and (ii) construct measurement-based emission rate estimates, which can improve emissions reporting and contribute to monitoring emission changes over time. Currently, the most common method for emission quantification uses the maximum methane enhancement detected while crossing a methane plume. However, the recorded maximum depends on instrument characteristics, such as measurement cell size, pump speed, and measurement frequency. Consequently, the current approach can only be used by instruments with similar characteristics. We suggest that the integrated spatial peak area is a more suitable quantity that can eliminate the bias between different instruments. Based on controlled release experiments conducted with various devices in four cities (London, Toronto, Rotterdam, and Utrecht), emission estimation methodologies were evaluated. Indeed, when different analysers were measuring in the same vehicle and from the same air inlet, the integrated spatial peak area was found to be a more robust metric across different methane gas analyser devices than the maximum methane enhancement. A statistical function based on integrated spatial peak area is proposed for more consistent emission estimations when using different instruments. On top of this systematic relation between actual emission rate and recorded spatial peak area, large variations in methane spatial peak area were observed for the multiple transects across the same release point, in line with previous experiments. This variability is the main contributor to uncertainty in efforts to use mobile measurements to prioritize leak repair. We show that repeated transects can reduce this uncertainty and improve the categorization into different leak categories. We recommend a minimum of three and an optimal range of five–seven plume transects for effective emission quantification to prioritize repair actions."

It is designed for automated and passive measurement of the thermal radiation emitted by the atmosphere, providing information about the vertical distribution of temperature and humidity, trace gases, clouds, and aerosols in the boundary layer. In this paper, we outline the key characteristics of the ASSIST hardware and signal processing algorithm that yields downwelling radiance spectra in near real-time. 
 The Atmospheric Sounder Spectrometer by Infrared Spectral Technology (ASSIST) is a Fourier-transform spectrometer designed, fabricated, and sold by LR Tech Inc., which operates in the thermal infrared. When attached to its automated radiometric calibration module, it functions as an infrared spectroradiometer (IRS) that passively measures the absolute spectral radiance within a 46 mrad full field of view and over the 525 to 3300 cm−1 (3 to 19 µm) spectral range. For atmospheric studies, the ASSIST IRS is integrated into a mobile enclosure enabling autonomous and reliable operation across a range of environmental conditions. It is typically configured for downwelling radiance measurements (zenith view) at 0.5 cm−1 bin spacing, 0.6 cm−1 resolution, and 4 min−1 sampling rate, closely replicating the behavior of the Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (AERI, in rapid-sampling mode), a similar but older IRS. Atmospheric variables affecting the shape of the downwelling thermal infrared radiance spectrum at ground level can be retrieved from the ASSIST high-resolution measurements using dedicated inversion algorithms. This includes the properties of some aerosols and simple clouds, the mixing ratios of trace gases, and the vertical distribution of temperature and water vapor (thermodynamic profile) in the lower troposphere above the instrument. Due to the form of the radiative transfer equation, thermodynamic profiles can only be retrieved with low to moderate vertical resolution but with sufficient accuracy and temporal resolution to help fill the current boundary layer observational gap. This paper provides a detailed description of the ASSIST design and near-real-time processing algorithm producing the calibrated radiance spectra that are useful in a variety of applications."

Inspired by collective behavioral patterns in bird flocks, we developed a “bird-like flock” time-domain sensing method through the utilization of functional long afterglow nanomaterials (AGNPs) for ClO– detection. Particularly, by translating avian aggregation-separation-alignment behaviors into an algorithmic framework, we presented a new sensing mode based on simplifying time decay curves into interpretable temporal metrics. In light of dual-emission AGNPs with impressive luminescence performance, ClO–-stimulated responsiveness, and derived metrics, our approach accurately distinguished ClO– concentrations down to 95 nM, resulting from the well-refined six temporal parameters. Furthermore, by integrating a portable aerosol generation device via pneumatic atomization and an aerosol-enriched hydrogel sensing matrix, we demonstrated that this time-domain analysis method maintained superior detection accuracy, outperforming traditional methods that often falter with complex water samples. This advancement paves the way for high-contrast sensing while enabling deeper exploration of atmospheric targets. Inspired by the dynamic evolution of avian flock behavior patterns, we developed a high-fidelity analytical method based on time-resolved long-afterglow spectral partitioning for qualitative and quantitative investigation of hypochlorite (ClO–) in atmospheric aerosols."

This study investigates the influence of long-range transport (LRT) on urban aerosol levels in Leipzig, Germany, using high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometry measurements at two sites: an urban traffic site (Eisenbahnstrasse, Eiba) and a rural background site (Melpitz), located ∼50 km apart. The sites were analyzed during winter 2017 under two dominant wind regimes: East and West. These sites were directly linked to each other, which was supported by cross-correlation analysis, with a typical time lag of −2 h in East and +4 h in West. Eastern winds brought higher concentrations (Melpitz: 35.50 μg m–3, Eiba: 37.47 μg m–3), while Western winds led to cleaner conditions. After being corrected for time lag, the Urban Increment (UI) was estimated, showing that during Eastern wind, only ∼9% of PM1 mass measured at Eiba was attributed to urban sources, highlighting the dominant contribution of regionally transported aerosol. Furthermore, source apportionment of organic aerosol (OA) identified five major factors─three primary OA and two oxygenated OA─at both sites. The findings underscore the significant role of regional pollution in shaping urban air quality and the need for cross-border emission reduction strategies."

Based on temporally dense ozonesondes over northern China, this study reports an anomalous vertical O3 distribution characterized by a “bottom‐heavy” structure. Specifically, O3 well exceeded the normal values in the middle‐to‐lower troposphere due to the stratospherically intruded airmasses (SIA), but was sharply reduced in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere region because of convectively lofted air transported from the Tibetan Plateau. Guided by the discovery of such a vertical O3 structure, we further assess the SIA contribution to tropospheric O3 using multi‐year AIRS satellite observations, and find that SIA appear frequently during summer and lead to short‐term O3 enhancements 35% above the normal values at 500 hPa. These results reveal the linkages between vertical O3 variations and synoptic processes, highlighting the non‐negligible contribution of SIA to tropospheric O3."

Natural aerosols are much less studied than fossil fuel-sourced aerosols for their air quality impacts, even though ‘natural’ aerosols such as dust and wildfires are likely to have substantially changed because of anthropogenic activities. Using the Community Earth System Model version 2 and the Community Atmospheric Model version 6 atmospheric model, we simulated dust and open-fire PM2.5 concentrations over Africa for preindustrial (PI), present-day, and future scenarios. Health impacts were assessed using the integrated exposure–response model applied to gridded population and disease-specific mortality data. Currently, we estimate that desert dust causes 30 000 (95% confidence interval (CI) 29 700–303 000) excess deaths annually in Africa (36% of the total excess premature mortality), while open fires result in 20 000 (95% CI: 19 500–22 500) excess deaths (24% of the mortality). All mortality estimates reported in this study represent annual excess deaths, calculated based on annual average PM2.5 concentrations. Concentrations of dust dominate aerosol concentration at the continental scale, and paleo records suggest dust loading has increased by 55% since PI times. Because of the lower population in dust-dominated regions, these do not affect health as much as combustion but are still important. In PI times, we estimate deaths due to dust as 6400 (95% CI: 6050–6750) (or 7000 if we keep the population at current levels), showing a large growth to the present day (over 400% increase). Excess deaths due to open fires have increased from 6900 (95% CI: 5800–7400) in the PI to 20 000 today (approximately 190% increase). For future scenarios in 2100, there is significant uncertainty; therefore, we present a high and low scenario, indicating that in the future, between 53 000 (95% CI: 49 000–55 000) and 67 000 (95% CI: 63 000–70 000) deaths will result from dust. Similarly, for future open fire excess deaths, we estimate a range of 19 000–40 000 (95% CI: 33 000–44 000) deaths, including population changes (−1% to +100% changes relative to today). In the current climate, as well as in the past and future, the amount and proportion of deaths attributed to ‘natural’ aerosols exceeds 50% of the total PM2.5 attributable mortality in Africa, showing that addressing possible changes in ‘natural’ aerosols is extremely important for improving air quality."

The O3 depletion events, while occurring most notably within the lowest few hundred metres above the Arctic Ocean, can induce a 5–7 % loss in the pan-Arctic tropospheric O3 burden during springtime. The study also found enhancements in O3 and NOy (mostly peroxyacetyl nitrate) concentrations in the Arctic due to northern boreal wildfires, particularly at higher altitudes. 
 Previous assessments on modelling Arctic tropospheric ozone (O3) have shown that most atmospheric models continue to experience difficulties in simulating tropospheric O3 in the Arctic, particularly in capturing the seasonal variations at coastal sites, primarily attributed to the lack of representation of surface bromine chemistry in the Arctic. In this study, two independent chemical transport models (CTMs), DEHM (Danish Eulerian Hemispheric Model) and GEM-MACH (Global Environmental Multi-scale – Modelling Air quality and Chemistry), were used to simulate Arctic lower-tropospheric O3 for the year 2015 at considerably higher horizontal resolutions (25  and 15 km, respectively) than the large-scale models in the previous assessments. Both models include bromine chemistry but with different mechanistic representations of bromine sources from snow- and ice-covered polar regions: a blowing-snow bromine source mechanism in DEHM and a snowpack bromine source mechanism in GEM-MACH. Model results were compared with a suite of observations in the Arctic, including hourly observations from surface sites and mobile platforms (buoys and ships) and ozonesonde profiles, to evaluate models' ability to simulate Arctic lower-tropospheric O3, particularly in capturing the seasonal variations and the key processes controlling these variations.Both models are found to behave quite similarly outside the spring period and are able to capture the observed overall surface O3 seasonal cycle and synoptic-scale variabilities, as well as the O3 vertical profiles in the Arctic. GEM-MACH (with the snowpack bromine source mechanism) was able to simulate most of the observed springtime ozone depletion events (ODEs) at the coastal and buoy sites well, while DEHM (with the blowing-snow bromine source mechanism) simulated much fewer ODEs. The present study demonstrates that the springtime O3 depletion process plays a central role in driving the surface O3 seasonal cycle in central Arctic, and that the bromine-mediated ODEs, while occurring most notably within the lowest few hundred metres of air above the Arctic Ocean, can induce a 5 %–7 % of loss in the total pan-Arctic tropospheric O3 burden during springtime. The model simulations also showed an overall enhancement in the pan-Arctic O3 concentration due to northern boreal wildfire emissions in summer 2015; the enhancement is more significant at higher altitudes. Higher O3 excess ratios (ΔO3/ΔCO) found aloft compared to near the surface indicate greater photochemical O3 production efficiency at higher altitudes in fire-impacted air masses. The model simulations further indicated an enhancement in NOy in the Arctic due to wildfires; a large portion of NOy produced from the wildfire emissions is found in the form of PAN that is transported to the Arctic, particularly at higher altitudes, potentially contributing to O3 production there."

In this study, we develop a novel steady-state theory to describe the atmospheric partitioning between gas and precipitation for SVOCs, improving upon the traditional equilibrium theory. We delve into the applications of this steady-state theory in predicting SVOCs’ phase distribution, deposition contribution, and scavenging efficiency. Our results demonstrate that steady-state theory outperforms equilibrium theory when compared to monitoring data, particularly in addressing the issue of overestimating scavenging ratios for certain SVOCs by equilibrium theory. The modeling outcomes reveal that, under steady-state theory, all SVOCs have upper limits in their phase distributions and deposition contributions. Most of these SVOCs are primarily found in the gas phase, with significant contributions from gaseous dry and wet deposition, which contrasts with predictions made using equilibrium theory. This advancement provides crucial insights into the atmospheric behavior and global fate of SVOCs."

A liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry method for the combined analysis of PFASs of variable chain length was applied to 204 high volume active air samples collected at Alert, Nunavut (82° 30′ N 62° 20′ W) between March 2014 and October 2023. Short-chain PFASs (scPFASs) were detected frequently (>75%) and at the highest median concentrations (trifluoroacetic acid (TFA): 20 pg/m3, perfluoropropionic acid (PFPrA): 1.1 pg/m3, perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA): 3.7 pg/m3), while nC > 10 PFAS were sparsely detected (detection frequency [DF] < 20%). Using a suspect-screening approach, hexafluoro-2,2-propanediol (HF2OH) and hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIPA) were confirmed in Arctic air at DF exceeding 75%. We find that concentrations of TFA and HF2OH were significantly correlated with temperature and increased during snowmelt periods, suggesting local emission or precursor release followed by degradation processes. The modified OECD LRTP and Pov assessment tool supported the potential of HFIPA and HF2OH to undergo long-range atmospheric transport. Time trend analysis reveals that after a short period of stable or declining levels in the mid-2010s, concentrations of PFBA, PFOA, and PFOS in Arctic air are increasing again since 2019, which may be a useful consideration when evaluating the effectiveness of the Stockholm Convention’s listing of PFOA and PFOS."

A Deep Neural Network (DNN) was adopted and compared with other machine learning (ML) models (i.e., Random Forest and Light Gradient-Boosting Machine) to estimate surface PM2.5 concentrations. The DNN model (without the tropospheric emissions: monitoring of pollution (TEMPO); 1 year) estimated PM2.5 with an interquartile range (IQR) of 4.32 μg/m3, and outperformed ML models, with up to 44.68% better index of agreement (IOA) and 45.28% smaller relative root-mean-square error (rRMSE), particularly in high PM2.5 cases. The hourly estimated PM2.5 closely matched the observed PM2.5 in both temporal trend and spatial distribution across the eastern CONUS. ML modeling was further enhanced to include TEMPO Level 1b (L1b) data. The DNN model with TEMPO improved performance, with an 8% higher R2 and a 25% lower rRMSE than the DNN model without TEMPO.

In this study, we developed an air sampling system based on the TEA technique using fast‐response mass flow controllers. The TEA system collects updrafts and downdrafts at sampling flow rates proportional to the vertical wind speed, unless the wind speed exceeds a certain threshold. We evaluated the TEA system above a temperate forest in Japan from May to December 2022 by comparing CO2 fluxes measured by the TEA system with those measured using EC. The comparison showed a moderate correlation (R = 0.86) with a small but significant negative bias in the TEA system (2%), likely because of the wind threshold.

This study uses Pandora observations to analyze the bias in TEMPO Level‐3 total column density of NO2 (TOTNO2) from August 2023 to December 2024. TEMPO achieves high accuracy at 5% cloud‐filtering threshold: correlation coefficient (R) of 0.86, index of agreement (IOA) of 0.91, mean absolute bias (MAB) of 1.423 × 1015 molecules/cm2, and a percentage MAB (MABP) of 23.1%, corresponding to a 12% underestimation. Accuracy decreases when pixels with greater cloud‐cover are included. Solar zenith angle (SZA) of 10–20° yields the highest accuracy (R: 0.87, MABP: 22.7%), whereas SZAs of 70–80° yield the lowest (R: 0.71, MABP: 35.2%). Consequently, early‐morning or near‐sunset observations are less reliable than midday. This discrepancy could stem from inaccurate simulation of diurnal variations in the boundary‐layer height in the a‐priori, and from larger uncertainties in radiative transfer at high SZAs. TEMPO overestimates TOTNO2 at low NO2 levels and underestimates at high levels, with maximum biases of +16% (low) and −31% (high), respectively. Station‐to‐station performance varies considerably, with R ranging from 0.29 to 0.84 and MABP from 14.9% to 49.3%. Stations situated at higher altitudes relative to the ground show reduced agreement with TEMPO, as Pandora cannot detect NO2 below the instrument's altitude, whereas TEMPO retrieves the full column. Validation of TEMPO TOTNO2 at TROPOMI overpass time indicates that TEMPO's performance relative to Pandora (IOA: 0.93, MABP: 22.3%) closely matches that of TROPOMI (IOA: 0.92, MABP: 20.1%)."

 Increased aerosols can modify the shape of the cloud Particle Size Distribution (PSD), thereby influencing the radiative properties of clouds, known as the Dispersion Effect (DE). However, a global, observation-based quantification of its impact on Aerosol-Cloud Interactions (ACI) is lacking, leading to DE being typically ignored in satellite-based estimates of ACI forcing. Here we propose a physics-based method that combines polarimetric satellite data on cloud PSD to achieve global observational quantification of DE’s impact on ACI in liquid-phase stratiform clouds. Globally, DE offsets ACI changes induced by droplet number concentration variation and liquid water path adjustment by 7% and −1.4%, respectively. Furthermore, a parameterization based on the global dataset of PSD shape parameters is developed to improve DE estimation in large-scale models. Both the quantification and parameterization enhance our understanding of DE and facilitate the inclusion of this non-negligible impact of DE on ACI in estimating aerosol climate forcing. Using polarimetric satellite data, the authors quantify the global impact of cloud droplet distribution changes on aerosol–cloud interactions and introduce a parameterization to enhance climate model performance."

 Despite the cleanest conditions, haze phenomena were observed at Syowa Station, Antarctica. During our measurements period of 1997–2022, 113 haze events were identified. General characteristics of Antarctic haze such as duration and horizontal scale were obtained from haze event analyses. Antarctic haze near the surface was identified mostly during May–October. Seasonal features of the Antarctic haze appearance were that they were maximal in August and were associated with strong wind conditions and sea-ice extent. Aerosol enhanced layers (AELs) appeared in the surface – free troposphere (ca. 4 km). AELs were identified also in mid-April – October. Furthermore, surface ozone (O3) was depleted during the Antarctic haze. The O3 depletion amount was maximal during August and minimal during polar night (June). Findings suggest that Antarctic haze phenomena make important contributions to atmospheric oxidative capacity and cloud processes in the Antarctic troposphere."

 The seasonal characteristics of aerosol number concentration (NCN) and cloud condensation nuclei number concentration (NCCN) in Seoul from 2019 to 2021 were analyzed. The average NCN and NCCN at 0.6 % supersaturation (SS) were 12,612 cm−3 and 2,829 cm−3, respectively, representing significant decreases of approximately 30 % and 50 % compared to the values from 2004 to 2010. Despite these reductions, diurnal and seasonal patterns remained consistent over time. However, distinct seasonal differences were noted, particularly in the relationship between NCN and NCCN: in winter, NCN and NCCN exhibited similar trends in both diurnal variation and back trajectory analysis, whereas in summer, their trends frequently diverged. To account for these pronounced seasonal differences, predictions of NCN and NCCN were conducted separately by season using the Random Forest Regression Model. The seasonally tailored predictions provided improved performance compared to the Multiple Linear Regression Model used as a baseline. Analysis of importance of each predictor revealed that NCN was the most significant predictor of NCCN at 0.4–1.0 % SS in winter, while particulate matter (PM10) played a more critical role across all supersaturation levels in summer and at 0.2 % SS in winter. These results suggest seasonally distinct mechanisms driving CCN formation in Seoul. Overall, this study highlighted recent trends in aerosols and CCN reflecting the rapid changes of air quality at a representative urban region in East Asia, and the data presented in this study can be used as representative values of aerosol and CCN in East Asian urban region for aerosol–cloud interaction studies in climate models."

 This study provides a comprehensive characterization of atmospheric aerosols collected from Gadanki (13.5°N, 79.2°E, a rural background) and Hyderabad (17.5°N, 78.6°E, an urban location), marking the first detailed analysis of aerosol particles in these contrasting environments in southern peninsular India. Aerosol particulate matter (PM) samples, spanning different aerodynamic size ranges (10 μm, 2.5 μm, and 1.4 μm), were analyzed spectroscopically to determine the molecular structure of the chemical species. Both organic compounds (hydrocarbons, carbonaceous species, and amines) and inorganic species (ammonium sulfates/nitrates, clay minerals, gypsum, calcium carbonate, kaolinite, and metal-oxygen bonds) were identified. The urban PM exhibited higher carbon content, while rural aerosols showed a greater oxygen ratio, as confirmed by Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Metal ions such as silicon (1.46–13.63 %), aluminium (0.34–5.72 %), sodium (0.61–3.99 %), calcium (0.14–1.5 %), iron (0.08–1.07 %), and zinc (0.06–0.81 %) were attributed to sources including vehicular emissions and wind-blown dust. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) revealed that the particles were irregularly shaped and aggregated. Ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectroscopy revealed strong UV absorption and high transparency (∼99 %) in the visible range, with optical band gaps of ∼5.6 eV and 5.8 eV for Hyderabad and Gadanki, respectively, indicating their non-conducting nature.

SO2 ${\text{SO}}_{2}$ emissions contribute to sulfate aerosol generation, impacting cloud formation and climate. This study refines the daily OMI‐HTAP SO2 ${\text{SO}}_{2}$ emissions from 134 point sources (mainly in the ME) for 2016 using inverse modeling, Ozone Mapping Profiling Suite (OMPS) SO2 ${\text{SO}}_{2}$ column loading observations, and the Lagrangian particle dispersion FLEXPART‐WRF model. This model used hourly meteorological data from the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF‐Chem) run with OMI‐HTAP SO2 ${\text{SO}}_{2}$ inventory with zeroed emissions from the point sources. This allowed the exclusion of the “background” SO2 ${\text{SO}}_{2}$ column loadings caused by the spatially distributed emissions from the OMPS observations. The WRF‐Chem's code for simulating SO2 ${\text{SO}}_{2}$ sinks (dry deposition, oxidation) was ported into the FLEXPART‐WRF. The annual mean RMSE computed for posterior column loadings relative to OMPS observations improved by ≈ ${\approx} $21%. The total posterior point emissions rate dropped by ≈ ${\approx} $18%. We found that this overestimation of prior emissions is inherent to data‐driven emission quantification methods (e.g., the Gaussian plume fitting method), which are not capable of removing “background” column loadings in areas with a high density of strong point sources. The proposed approach avoids this deficiency. For some countries, seasonal variations of inverted emission rates are observed. The enhanced OMI‐HTAP data set will be applied in air‐quality modeling over the ME."

 Ice-nucleating particles (INPs) play a pivotal role in cloud formation and precipitation, yet predicting their concentrations remains difficult due to limited understanding of their spatiotemporal variability and characteristics. Therefore, it is important to provide insights into how aerosol properties and meteorological parameters are related to INP concentrations. This study investigated INP concentrations, their heat sensitivity, particle chemical components, and meteorological parameters at urban (Yokohama) and rural (Noto) sites in Japan during Dust and Non-Dust periods. While no single key factor consistently explained INP concentrations, relatively strong associations were observed with factors implying particles such as mineral dust, heat-sensitive biological particles, and Pb-containing particles from coal and waste combustion, with variations depending on site and season. During the Dust period, INP concentrations at both sites were correlated with the mineral indicators (R > 0.57), though INPs above −15 °C remained low at Noto site (R = 0.49). In the Non-Dust period, mineral indicators cannot account for INP levels at either site (R < −0.31). Heat treatment-induced deactivation of INPs above −15 °C in the urban area suggested a close association between biological INPs and mineral particles. Although submicron INPs account for only a small fraction of total INPs at the surface (e.g., < 6.5 % at −12.5 °C), the particle types that contributed to the variability in INP concentrations were nevertheless supported previous qualitative findings. Our findings also highlight the complexity of quantitatively linking environmental factors that vary by region and time to INP concentration variations to characterize aerosol–cloud interactions."

 Chinese high-density visibility observation stations provide more uniform coverage than traditional air quality monitors, spanning urban, rural, and remote areas, which improves spatial representativeness. The visibility data from these stations has the potential to optimize aerosol initial conditions in air quality models, thereby improving the accuracy of pollution forecasting. This study details the development of a visibility observation assimilation module integrated with the WRF-Chem model. We aim to assimilate visibility data and evaluate the improvement in model performance achieved through assimilation compared to a direct WRF-Chem simulation. The assimilation system utilizes an advanced multi-scale three-dimensional variational assimilation (MS-3DVAR) technique and employs WRF-Chem MOSAIC aerosol species concentrations as control variables. To extensively evaluate the developed visibility assimilation algorithm, we conducted three numerical experiments focused on the forecasting accuracy of dust events that occurred in Northern China in March 2021. The first experiment (DA_PM&AOD) assimilated particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) data. The second experiment (DA_EXT) assimilated visibility data, while the third experiment (DA_ALL) integrated particulate matter, AOD, and visibility data. The evaluation demonstrates that, the control experiment group consistently underestimated the values during dust events. The DA_EXT assimilation group significantly improved the forecast accuracy of PM10 concentration and EXT (extinction coefficient). In the DA_PM&AOD experiment, the agreement index between PM10 simulation and observation increased to above 0.9. In the DA_ALL experiment, the agreement index for EXT simulation reached 0.677. The evaluation reveals that assimilating visibility data significantly improves both the initial aerosol fields and dust process forecasting in the model. This enhancement compensates for spatial and temporal discontinuities in satellite observations of visible light channels."

In contrast, model simulations of 21st‐century stratospheric temperature changes show widespread cooling driven by increasing greenhouse gases, with local warming in the Antarctic lower stratosphere due to ozone healing. We provide evidence that these discrepancies between observed and simulated stratospheric temperature changes are linked to a slowdown of the Brewer‐Dobson Circulation, particularly in the SH. These changes in the stratospheric circulation are strongest from October through December. This altered circulation warms the SH subtropical lower stratosphere while cooling the Antarctic lower stratosphere, canceling and even reversing the Antarctic ozone recovery that would have occurred in its absence during this period. When circulation changes are accounted for, the SH subtropical lower‐stratospheric warming is removed, and Antarctic lower‐stratospheric warming is revealed with enhanced ozone healing, highlighting the crucial role of the stratospheric circulation in shaping temperature and ozone changes."

Our analysis reveals that smoke plumes transport light‐absorbing aerosols aloft to the marine stratocumulus region, which triggers cooling and cloud fraction enhancement beneath. During the smoke impact, the cloud tops ascend until they reach the height of the strengthened inversion layer, where smoke intensifies the temperature gradient by heating above. Besides, when absorbing aerosols and the accompanied warming are present in lower layers, there is no evident cloud enhancement, highlighting the importance of smoke height to cloud adjustment. This study also examines the fire smoke impacts on the diurnal cycle of stratocumulus and the boundary layer. The smoke may mitigate the cloud breakup in the afternoon, when wildfire aerosols locally heat the atmosphere above the clouds and reduce downward entrainment into the clouds by strengthening the inversion. During nighttime, the surface temperature shows a more rapid warming under smoke perturbation. Combined with the cooling at the cloud layer, this results in the boundary layer deepening more during nighttime than during the day. Meanwhile, intensified convection leads to an increased rate of water supply to the stratocumulus clouds at night."

Traditional in situ vertical observations of those properties mainly rely on aircraft platforms, which are costly, subject to numerous constraints, and are unsuitable for near‐ground (<500 m) measurements. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and tethered balloons (TBs) are ideal platforms for observations within the atmospheric boundary layer but can only carry portable instruments due to payload limitations. In this study, a novel method for vertical profiling of aerosol physicochemical properties within 1 km is designed utilizing a self‐developed lightweight airborne aerosol sampling system (AS2) integrated onto UAVs or TBs platforms.

The efficiency of adjusting low level humidity is confirmed by a single temperature observation test. Nine experiments were conducted to assess the impact of coupled versus uncoupled SH configurations on the data assimilation system performance, and the effect of different weights assigned to the flow-dependent background error covariance on forecast accuracy. The results show that the assimilation of FY-3E MWHS-2 data within the 3DEnVar system coupled SH significantly improves the accuracy of typhoon forecasts. This improvement is particularly evident in the forecasted track, central pressure, and maximum wind speed. In this study, the optimal weight of the flow-dependent background error covariance was determined to be 50 %, which resulted in the lowest average errors in track (36.73 km), central pressure (17.37 hPa), and maximum wind speed (−11.56 m/s). Moreover, the DA system coupled SH demonstrated better performance in reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) and BIAS across the zonal component of wind (U-wind), meridional component of wind (V-wind), temperature, and specific humidity.

Here, we investigate the ability of OCO-2/3 retrievals to constrain CO2 emissions for the state of California for the major emission sectors (i.e., fossil fuels, net ecosystem exchange, and wildfire). 
 Satellite observations are instrumental in observing spatiotemporal variability in carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, which can be used to derive fluxes of this greenhouse gas. This study leverages NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 and -3 (OCO-2 and OCO-3, respectively) CO2 observations with a Gaussian process (GP) machine learning inverse model, a Bayesian nonparametric approach well suited for integrating the unique spatiotemporal characteristics of these satellite observations, to estimate subregional CO2 fluxes. Utilizing the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (CTM) to simulate column-average CO2 concentrations (XCO2) for 2020 in California – a period marked by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, drought conditions, and significant wildfire activity – we estimated the state-wide CO2 emission rates constrained by OCO-2/3. This study developed prior fossil fuel emissions to reflect reduced activities during the COVID-19 pandemic, while net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and fire emissions were derived based on satellite data. GEOS-Chem source-specific XCO2 concentrations for fossil fuels, NEE, fire, and oceanic sources were simulated coincident to OCO-2/3 XCO2 retrievals to estimate state-wide sector-specific and total CO2 emissions. GP inverse model results suggest that annual posterior median fossil fuel emissions were consistent with prior estimates (317.8 and 338.4 Tg CO2 yr−1, respectively; 95 % confidence level) and that posterior NEE fluxes had less carbon uptake compared to prior fluxes (−36.8 vs. −99.2 Tg CO2 yr−1, respectively; 95 % confidence level). Posterior fire CO2 emissions were estimated to be 68.0 Tg CO2 yr−1, which was much lower than a priori estimates (103.3 Tg CO2 yr−1). The total median annual CO2 emissions for the state of California in 2020 were estimated to be 349.6 Tg CO2 yr−1 (range of 272.8–428.6 Tg CO2 yr−1; 95 % confidence level), aligning closely with the prior total estimate of 342.5 Tg CO2 yr−1. This study, for the first time, demonstrates that OCO-2/3 XCO2 observations can be assimilated into inverse models to estimate state-wide source-specific CO2 fluxes on a seasonal and annual scale."

Bertram,Surprising Crystallinity of Biomass Burning Secondary Organic Aerosol from Catechol and Nitrate Radical Reactions: Evidence and Possible Implications,"Biomass burning events, including wildfires, emit large amounts of phenolic compounds such as catechol. These compounds can react with nitrate radicals (NO3), a key nighttime oxidant, to form secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Although SOA is traditionally assumed to be noncrystalline, we present surprising evidence from X-ray diffraction that SOA formed from catechol + NO3 in an atmospheric simulation chamber contains crystalline material. In addition, the diffraction pattern and mass spectrum of this SOA closely resemble those of nebulized crystalline 4-nitrocatechol (4-NC), suggesting the presence of crystalline 4-NC within the SOA. These findings help explain unusual size distributions of catechol + NO3 SOA observed in prior studies and conflicting measurements of 4-NC’s effective saturation vapor concentrations. Calculations of 4-NC’s melting temperature as a function of its mole fraction in SOA, combined with observations of ambient 4-NC concentrations, suggest that 4-NC can exist in a solid crystalline phase state at temperatures below 288 K in wildfire plumes in the atmosphere. The presence of crystalline 4-NC and crystalline SOA in wildfire plumes may affect particle size distributions, cloud formation, and heterogeneous and photolytic reaction rates, with potentially important implications for atmospheric chemistry, air quality, and climate, warranting additional studies on this topic."

While the secondary BrC formation via dark reactions involving ammonium and glyoxal/methylglyoxal (NH4+-G/MG) has been extensively documented, their photochemical behaviors remain poorly understood. This study investigates the photoinduced chemical changes of G, MG, and BrC species during irradiation. The dominant BrC species in NH4+-G systems and NH4+-MG systems are imidazole-2-carboxaldehyde (2-IC) and 1-(5-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl) ethanone (M-IE), respectively, which are identified as potent photosensitizers experimentally, with support from density functional theory (DFT) simulations. Reactive oxygen species derived from photolysis and photosensitization contribute to compositional diversity by yielding small organic acids and ring-opening products (e.g., amides). Interestingly, in NH4+-MG systems, both M-IE and MG can initiate the transformation of the dominant nonlight-absorbing product (i.e., 5-methylimidazole, 5-MIM) into imidazole-5-carboxaldehyde (5-IC), which is a BrC species and a potential photosensitizer. This work elucidates the photoinduced transformations in NH4+-G/MG systems at a molecular level and highlights that MG and M-IE are sources of oxidants to form new BrC species via photosensitization. These findings provide new insights into the behaviors of atmospheric photosensitizers, the oxidative potential from dicarbonyls, and the photochemical evolution of BrC in aerosols."

To account for more than half of mean concentrations due to routine emissions, sites at distances 20–50 km from the receptor site were included in the simulations. Nearly all of the highest observed concentrations were observed at night. For each night in the simulation, the location and magnitude of the maximum predicted concentration and maximum observed concentration were compared, and approximately two-thirds of the highest observed nighttime maximum concentrations were accounted for by routine emissions. In contrast, approximately a third of the highest daytime maxima could be accounted for by routine emissions. Most of the large observed maxima that are attributable to routine emissions are predicted to be caused by sources that were within 10 km of the receptor site, but sources up to 20 or more kilometers from the receptor also contributed to the predicted concentrations. A case study is provided demonstrating the potential of coupling site-level inventories of routine emissions with dispersion modeling for attributing sources of elevated hydrocarbon concentrations."

This study aimed to investigate the potential links between long-term maximum daily 8-h mean (MDA8) O3 and the occurrence of age-related cataracts in China. We analyzed data from 11,449 participants in the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS), from 1998 to 2018. The fully adjusted models of Cox proportional hazards regression presented hazard ratios (HRs) for MDA8 O3 exposure one, two, and three years prior to the end of follow-up were 1.45 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.35, 1.57], 1.21 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.30), and 1.23 (95% CI: 1.15, 1.32), respectively.

 The heterogeneous conversion of SO2 plays a crucial role in atmospheric sulfate formation. In recent years, it has been recognized that light-absorbing brown carbon can generate reactive oxygen species and enhance the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere. However, the influence of atmospheric brown carbon on the heterogeneous conversion of SO2 on mineral oxide surfaces has not yet achieved sufficient attention. In this study, the impact of imidazole-2-carboxaldehyde (2-IC), a ubiquitous atmospheric brown carbon, on the heterogeneous conversion of SO2 on hematite particle surfaces was investigated in the absence and presence of simulated solar irradiation by using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). Results indicated that 2-IC can significantly influence the heterogeneous reactivities of hematite. Under dry conditions, the heterogeneous reactivities decreased with the increase of the loaded 2-IC mass fraction in the absence of light, but in the presence of light, the higher reactivities were observed at an appropriate mass fraction range of 2-IC when compared to pure hematite, showing the promoting effects in this mass fraction range. Under the condition of 58 % relative humidity, the heterogeneous reactivities in the absence of light decreased with the increasing mass fractions of 2-IC, and pure hematite showed the highest reactivity. However, in the presence of light, the heterogeneous reactivities increased first and then decreased with the increasing mass fractions of 2-IC, and the mixture containing 1 × 10−4 % 2-IC showed the highest reactivity. Water molecules can renew surface reactive sites and facilitate the photosensitization reaction of 2-IC, and further enhance sulfate formation. A possible mechanism for the impact of 2-IC on the heterogeneous conversion of SO2 on hematite is proposed. This study reveals a new pathway for brown carbon to enhance SO2 conversion and sulfate formation in the atmosphere, providing new insights into its atmospheric impact."

By analyzing global observations and chemical reanalysis outputs, key bias drivers, such as meteorological conditions and precursor emissions, were identified. This provides actionable insights to improve chemical transport models, observation systems, and emissions inventories, ultimately enhancing ozone reanalysis for better air pollution management. 
 This study employs an explainable machine learning (ML) framework to examine the regional dependencies of surface ozone biases and their underlying drivers in global chemical reanalysis. Surface ozone observations from the Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report (TOAR) network and chemical reanalysis outputs from the multi-model multi-constituent chemical (MOMO-Chem) data assimilation (DA) system for the period 2005–2020 were utilized for ML training. A regression-tree-based randomized ensemble ML approach successfully reproduced the spatiotemporal patterns of ozone bias in the chemical reanalysis relative to TOAR observations across North America, Europe, and East Asia. The global distributions of ozone bias predicted by ML revealed systematic patterns influenced by meteorological conditions, geographic features, anthropogenic activities, and biogenic emissions. The primary drivers identified include temperature, surface pressure, carbon monoxide (CO), formaldehyde (CH2O), and nitrogen oxide (NOx) reservoirs such as nitric acid (HNO3) and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN). The ML framework provided a detailed quantification of the magnitude and variability of these drivers, delivering bias-corrected ozone estimates suitable for human health and environmental impact assessments. The findings provide valuable insights that can inform advancements in chemical transport modeling, DA, and observational system design, thereby improving surface ozone reanalysis. However, the complex interplay among numerous parameters highlights the need for rigorous validation of identified drivers against established scientific knowledge to attain a comprehensive understanding at the process level. Further advancements in ML interpretability are essential to achieve reliable, actionable outcomes and to lead to an improved reanalysis framework for more effectively mitigating air pollution and its impacts."

The dataset shows significant spatiotemporal variations of fire PM2.5 in the past decades, serving a useful tool for exploring the impacts of fire-related air pollutants on climate, ecosystems, and public health. 
 Fires are a significant disturbance in Earth's systems. Smoke aerosols emitted from fires can cause environmental degradation and climatic perturbations, leading to exacerbated air pollution and posing hazards to public health. However, research on the climatic and health impacts of fire emissions is severely limited by the scarcity of air pollution data directly attributed to these emissions. Here, we develop a global daily fire-sourced PM2.5 concentration ([PM2.5]) dataset at a spatial resolution of 0.25° for the period 2000–2023, using the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model driven with two fire emission inventories, the Global Fire Emissions Database version 4.1 with small fires (GFED4.1s) and the Quick Fire Emission Dataset version 2.5r1 (QFED2.5). Simulated all-source [PM2.5] is bias-corrected using a machine learning algorithm, which incorporates ground observations from over 9000 monitoring sites worldwide. Then the simulated ratios between fire-sourced and all-source [PM2.5] at individual grids are applied to derive fire-sourced [PM2.5]. Globally, the average fire-sourced [PM2.5] is estimated to be 2.04 µg m−3 with GFED4.1s and 3.96 µg m−3 with QFED2.5. Both datasets show consistent spatial distributions with regional hotspots in central Africa and widespread decreasing trends over most areas. While the mean levels of fire-sourced [PM2.5] are much higher at low latitudes, fire episodes in the boreal regions can cause PM2.5 levels that are comparable to those of the tropics.

Field observations have identified significant concentrations of C5-alkene triols, yet no air quality models currently account for the formation pathways of these compounds. Simultaneously, the 2-MT concentrations are usually overestimated by 4–5 times compared to field observations due to the lack of the C5-alkene triols formation pathway. In this study, we expanded the isoprene-SOA scheme and implemented it into the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model with the latest Community Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Multiphase Mechanism version 2 (CRACMM2) mechanism. The missing formation of C5-alkene triols via the low NOx isoprene epoxydiols (IEPOX) pathway, the gas-particle partitioning of isoprene-derived SOA tracers, and the high NOx SOA formation pathway are comprehensively considered in this expanded isoprene-SOA scheme. Results indicate that the C5-alkene triols contribute to 68% of all isoprene-derived SOA tracers, with approximately 50% in the gas phase and the remainder in the particle phase. The 2-MT concentrations are better represented in the new scheme compared to the default CRACMM2 based on the field observations. The overall SOA is improved by 0–4 μg/m3 in China with the expanded scheme. The isoprene-derived SOA is highly influenced by anthropogenic emissions, especially SOx (SO2 + SO42–), and the reduction in SOx reduces both isoprene aerosol tracers and organosulfates significantly, while a similar reduction in NOx leads to small increases in these species for both particle and gas phases."

Aerosols are found to be the dominant factor explaining LWP variability, surpassing meteorological factors (MFs). By isolating aerosol effects from meteorological influences, the ML reveals a negative linear relationship between LWP and cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) in log space, likely driven by entrainment drying via evaporation‐entrainment feedback. This aligns with the negative regime of the inverted‐V relationship reported in previous studies, while no positive LWP responses are found due to a limited number of precipitating cases in EPCAPE. Furthermore, the sensitivity of LWP to Nd shows a non‐linear dependence on MFs like moisture contrast between surface and free troposphere and lower‐tropospheric stability. This occurs due to the interplay between the MFs' direct effects on entrainment drying and indirect effects through LWP adjustments."

Conventional satellite‐based Nd retrieval methods typically assume adiabatic clouds (cloud adiabatic fraction (fad) = 1), leading to significant underestimations, particularly in environments characterized by low fad. Furthermore, conventional methods retrieve Nd near cloud tops, often much lower than near the cloud base. This study applies the recently developed fad retrievals to retrieve cloud base Nd accurately. The retrieval is based on the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard polar orbiting satellites. The validation was done against ship‐based measurements over the ocean at the Australian Great Barrier Reef. The results indicate that the traditional adiabatic assumption resulted in cloud base Nd underestimations by a factor of 2.73. To resolve this, we implemented two averaged‐fad methods and one pixel‐level fad correction. Averaged‐fad‐based corrections improve Nd accuracy but yield higher root mean square errors (RMSE) and lower correlation coefficients (R) due to mean − value reliance. Pixel‐level fad‐based correction minimizes bias by avoiding error amplification from fad spatial averaging. When Nd retrieved by pixels with cloud optical depth larger than the 50th value, the correction optimizes the following results: slope ∼1 (0.983 ± 0.088), lowest RMSE (30.365 ± 12.212 cm−3), highest R (0.728, P < 0.05), narrowest metrics confidence intervals, and ±30% validated error. This study underscores the importance of pixel‐level fad correction in satellite‐based Nd retrieval, offering improved accuracy for climate modeling and weather forecasting. Future work should expand validation to diverse regions and seasons to further assess the method's generalizability and limitations."

Oceans emit a variety of VOCs via complex biological, chemical, and physical processes. Although dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is a known precursor in marine aerosol formation, marine emissions of organic gases are more diverse. Here, we quantify semi‐controlled sea‐to‐air net fluxes of isoprene (0.50 ± 0.30 ng m−2 s−1), monoterpenes (0.93 ± 0.73 ng m−2 s−1), and oxygenated organics (methanol: 2.50 ± 1.13 ng m−2 s−1) using in situ mesocosm studies of natural seawaters in the south‐west Pacific Ocean. Under wind speeds <3 m s−1, flux compositions varied between Frontal, Subtropical, and Subantarctic seawaters, with several VOCs exhibiting fluxes comparable to or exceeding DMS (0.75 ± 0.86 ng m−2 s−1). Significant associations were observed among biogenic VOC fluxes and phytoplankton groups, notably with nanophytoplankton. The impact of atmospheric ozone changes was tested by introducing additional ozone into one mesocosm, which increased methanol emissions while decreasing monoterpene and acetaldehyde fluxes, making the ocean a sink for the latter. Such studies provide quantitative links between natural phytoplankton assemblages and emissions of climatically relevant marine VOCs, offering the potential to use satellite oceanographic data to improve the representation of these emissions in chemistry‐climate models."

Aromatic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) accounted for ∼50% of measured VOCs (molar ratio), while methanol and ethanol accounted for ∼34%. The total wintertime VOC burden and contribution from aromatics were much higher than other US urban areas. Based on diel cycles and positive matrix factorization (PMF) analyses, we find traffic was the largest source of NO, CO, black carbon, and aromatic VOCs. Formic and acetic acid, hydroxyacetone, furanoids, and other VOCs were primarily attributed to residential wood combustion (RWC). Formaldehyde was one of several VOCs featuring significant contributions from multiple sources: RWC (∼35%), aging (∼30%), traffic (∼21%), and heating oil combustion (HO, ∼14%). PMF solutions assigned primary fine particulate matter to RWC (10%–30%), traffic (25%–40%), and HO (30%–60%), the latter likely reflecting high sulfur emissions from older furnaces and fast secondary chemistry. Despite cold and dark conditions, secondary processes impacted many trace gas and particle species' budget by ±10%–20% and more in some cases. Transport of O3‐rich regional air into Fairbanks contributed to aging, specifically NO3 radical formation. This work highlights a long‐term trend observed in Fairbanks: increasing traffic and decreasing RWC relative contributions as total pollution decreases. Fairbanks exports a relatively fresh pollutant mixture to the regional arctic, the fate of which warrants future study."

 Diterpenes, found in trees, have been overlooked in atmospheric chemistry due to their low volatility and presumed negligible emissions. However, advances in sampling and analytical methods now allow for their detection in the gas phase. Here we quantify diterpene emission factors and evaluate their role in secondary organic aerosol formation. By incorporating all available emission data and laboratory-derived aerosol yields into the MONARCH chemistry transport model, we assessed their atmospheric contribution. Chamber experiments revealed kaurene yields of 1.8–17%, indicating efficient gas-to-particle conversion. Global emissions were estimated at 11.5 (0.1–94.3) Tg yr−¹, contributing 0.63 (0.005–5.19) Tg yr−¹ to secondary organic aerosol production and a burden of 0.008 (0.00007–0.07) Tg. This corresponds to 13%, 6.4%, and 19% of the aerosol burden from isoprene, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes, respectively. These results demonstrate that diterpenes are a previously underestimated, but potentially important, source of secondary organic aerosol, with implications for biosphere-atmosphere interactions. Diterpenes are an underestimated source of secondary organic aerosol, accounting for up to 13% of the secondary organic aerosol burden from isoprene, according to combined chamber experiments and chemical transport modelling."

 Australian dust storms have principally been studied using ground observations that are limited in being spatially sparse, and low Earth orbit satellites in turn limited by their relatively poor temporal resolution. In this study, the high temporal resolution of geostationary satellite monitoring was harnessed to assess the ability of Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) at detecting and mapping five case study Australian dust storm events between 2019 and 2020. AHI thermal bands (9μm,10μm and 11μm) were used to create Brightness Temperature Difference (BTD) indices which were then applied to a Threshold-based Dust Detection Algorithm (TBDDA). Event-specific index thresholds were tuned for each event at the time of the highest dust concentration as recorded by a ground observation network. Selection of event-specific thresholds showed considerable variation and subsequent evaluation of dust storm detection revealed a low average Probability of Detection (POD) of 0.01 and a False Alarm Ratio (FAR) of 0.3 for the five events. The variability within the thresholds for each index across the five dust storms emphasises the lack of a singly suitable threshold set for event detection. It highlights inefficiency in the TBDDA when observing individual Australian dust events. A method that does not rely on event-specific thresholds is seen as the next step in advancing dust storm detection in Australia."

 Against the backdrop of global warming, springtime ozone (O3) pollution in the Sichuan Basin, China, has become increasingly prominent. To identify the characteristics and causes of frequent springtime O3 pollution events, two severe episodes during May 2020 and 2024 were investigated using ground-based monitoring data, ERA5 reanalysis datasets, satellite observations, and a random forest model. During these two episodes, 17 and 12 O3 exceedance days were recorded across 18 and 16 cities, respectively. The megacity Chengdu recorded the most exceedance days (28) and the highest maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O3 concentration (245 μg/m3). O3 pollution tended to occur in Chengdu when temperature surpassed 29 °C, relative humidity was below 60 %, boundary layer height exceeded 800 m, surface net solar radiation was greater than 400 W/m2, surface pressure dropped below 94,500 Pa, and wind speed was between 1 and 2 m/s. During the O3 episodes, meteorological parameters predominantly fell within the ranges, influenced by surface low-pressure systems and high-pressure ridges. Elevated formaldehyde columns and a recent significant decline in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were observed. Under current precursor levels, weather-normalized MDA8 O3 concentrations ranged from 98 to 126 μg/m3. However, unfavorable meteorological conditions drove a 38–122 μg/m3 increase, while favorable conditions led to a 9–82 μg/m3 reduction. Crucially, enhanced solar radiation, rising temperatures and boundary layer heights, decreasing humidity, and concurrent NO2 reduction with high volatile organic compounds levels were key factors contributing to spring O3 formation. These findings suggest that extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change are likely to intensify spring O3 pollution in this region."

 This study analyzes the temporal variations of dust-related traffic fatalities across the United States (U.S.), with a focus on the Southwestern region from 2007 to 2022. Data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Storm Events Database and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) are utilized to assess these variations. The Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) Aerosol Detection Product (ADP) and North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) data are examined to quantify dust occurrence frequencies, their spatial distributions, and the environmental factors contributing to the temporal variations of dust-related fatalities. Results indicate that dust storm events and fatalities are concentrated in the arid and semiarid states of the Southwestern U.S. (SWUS), particularly in Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and California. The findings reveal a modest decline in dust storm-related fatalities from 2007 to 2022. However, the most deadliest years (2017 and 2021) occurred in the latter half of the study period. Satellite retrievals show a decrease in dust occurrence frequency from 2012 to 2022 over the SWUS, which may partially explain the observed decline in dust-related fatalities. NARR data suggest that a change in soil moisture may substantially influence dust emissions. Given that wind speeds remained relatively stable throughout the study period, the observed decline in dust storm frequency is more likely driven by increased soil moisture (0–200 cm) rather than changes in wind conditions. These results highlight the importance of environmental conditions in modulating dust-related transportation safety risks, and the needs of integrating satellite observations, ground-based measurements, and reanalysis data to improve understanding of trends in dust-related fatalities and their driving factors."

 The heterogeneous oxidation of sulfur dioxide (SO2) by organic peroxides (POs) in aerosol represents an important pathway for atmospheric sulfate formation. However, the reactivity of SO2 with POs arising from anthropogenic sources and the resulting sulfate formation characteristics remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the heterogeneous reaction of SO2 with secondary organic aerosol (SOA) derived from the photooxidation of 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (1,3,5-TMB), one of major precursors of anthropogenic SOA. The reactive uptake coefficient (γSO2) of SO2 on 1,3,5-TMB-derived SOA was determined to be on the order of 10−4, depending markedly on aerosol liquid water content and particulate PO concentration. The second-order reaction rate constant (kobs) between 1,3,5-TMB-derived POs and dissolved SO2 is estimated to range between 352 and 3.3 × 104 M−1 s−1 at pH of 3–5, which are comparable to the kobs values previously determined for monoterpene-derived POs under similar conditions. Furthermore, 1,3,5-TMB-derived peroxides efficiently convert S(IV) into inorganic sulfate (30–88 %) and organosulfates (12–70 %). This study reveals the heterogeneous reactivity of anthropogenic SOA and POs towards SO2 and allows for a more accurate assessment of the role of PO-SO2 interactions in the formation and aging of secondary aerosol."

We evaluated the stomatal component of ozone dry deposition modeled by atmospheric chemistry models at six sites. We find that models and observation-based estimates agree at times during the growing season at all sites, but some models overestimated the stomatal component during the dry summers at a seasonally dry site. 
 A substantial portion of tropospheric O3 dry deposition occurs after diffusion of O3 through plant stomata. Simulating stomatal uptake of O3 in 3D atmospheric chemistry models is important in the face of increasing drought-induced declines in stomatal conductance and enhanced ambient O3. Here, we present a comparison of the stomatal component of O3 dry deposition (egs) from chemical transport models and estimates of egs from observed CO2, latent heat, and O3 flux. The dry deposition schemes were configured as single-point models forced with data collected at flux towers. We conducted sensitivity analyses to study the impact of model parameters that control stomatal moisture stress on modeled egs. Examining six sites around the Northern Hemisphere, we find that the seasonality of observed flux-based egs agrees with the seasonality of simulated egs at times during the growing season, with disagreements occurring during the later part of the growing season at some sites. We find that modeled water stress effects are too strong in a temperate–boreal transition forest. Some single-point models overestimate summertime egs in a seasonally water-limited Mediterranean shrubland. At all sites examined, modeled egs was sensitive to parameters that control the vapor pressure deficit stress. At specific sites that experienced substantial declines in soil moisture, the simulation of egs was highly sensitive to parameters that control the soil moisture stress. The findings demonstrate the challenges in accurately representing the effects of moisture stress on the stomatal sink of O3 during observed increases in dryness due to ecosystem-specific plant–resource interactions."

We measured the physical properties of BC at a background site in Germany. In summer, BC particles were smaller and the mixture with other atmospheric components occurred during the daytime. In winter, emissions from residential heating significantly influenced BC's properties. Understanding these characteristics of BC can help to improve the accuracy of aerosol optic simulation. 
 Uncertainties persist in estimating the radiative forcing of black carbon (BC) due to an incomplete understanding of its microphysical properties. This study investigated the physical properties of refractory black carbon (rBC) at the central European background site Melpitz during summer and winter, using a single-particle soot photometer coupled with a thermodenuder. Different air masses associated with distinct rBC properties were identified in both seasons. In summer, rBC exhibited a similar mass concentration (∼0.16 µg m−3) among different air masses, with the smallest mass median diameter (MMD) of rBC observed in the long transportation from the northwest (140 nm), while in winter, the highest concentration (1.23 µg m−3) and largest MMD (216 nm) were both observed in the air mass influenced by the easterly winds. Thickly coated rBC fractions increased during the daytime in summer, indicating that the photochemical processes significantly influence the rBC mixing state. In winter, a higher fraction (27 %) of rBC, with thick coatings in the cold air mass compared to the warm air mass (14 %), suggests the contribution of residential heating emissions to the mixing state. Most rBC retained a low-volatility coating in the thermodenuder samples (63 % mass fraction). In summer, photochemical processes also contribute to coating volatility, showing a higher fraction of rBC particles containing low-volatility coatings during the daytime. In winter, low-volatility coatings showed no significant diurnal variation and were more dependent on ambient temperature. Therefore, rBC coating volatility in winter is more influenced by emission sources, particularly residential heating, rather than atmospheric processes."

We found lower ozone (with stratospheric origin) in the Southern Hemisphere, especially during years of severe ozone depletion. Sudden stratospheric warming events increased the ozone in each hemisphere, highlighting the relationship between stratospheric processes and ozone in the upper troposphere, where ozone is an important greenhouse gas. 
 Ozone changes in the upper troposphere–lower stratosphere (UTLS) resulting from dynamical and chemical processes strongly affect the atmosphere's radiative forcing. This study analyzed intra- and inter-hemispheric ozone differences in the UTLS within the 45–60° latitude band, distinguishing between years disrupted by sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events from 2002 to 2022. We utilized measurements from IAGOS commercial aircraft (45–60° N), long-term ozonesonde records (45–60° S) and unique in situ measurements from the high altitude and long range (HALO) research aircraft deployed over the southernmost region of South America (45–60° S) in September–November 2019 as a part of the Southern Hemisphere Transport, Dynamics, and Chemistry (SouthTRAC) research campaign. The mission period enabled us to examine the impact of two Southern Hemisphere (SH) SSW events that developed during 2002 and 2019. To enhance the spatial coverage, we incorporated Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service reanalysis data. Stratospheric air origin was assigned using relative humidity (<20 %) and carbon monoxide (<50 nmol mol−1) thresholds. Our results show that air masses of stratospheric origin had higher ozone abundances in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) UTLS than in the SH (between 300–200 hPa and 45–60° latitude): in high ozone depletion years in the stratospheric vortex, the SH ozone median (184 nmol mol−1) was only 54 % of that in the NH (341 nmol mol−1), while in low depletion years, SH ozone median (214 nmol mol−1) reached 57 % of the NH values (371 nmol mol−1). Notably, the SSW events (2002 and 2019) increased SH UTLS ozone by 24 % (43 nmol mol−1) compared to high depletion years, while in the NH, the increase was 9 % (31 nmol mol−1)."

Neu,"Quantifying biases in TROPESS AIRS, CrIS, and joint AIRS+OMI tropospheric ozone products using ozonesondes","Tropospheric ozone is a harmful pollutant and powerful greenhouse gas. For satellite products to accurately quantify trends in tropospheric ozone, they must have a low bias compared to a reliable source of data. This study compares three NASA satellite products to ozonesonde data. They have low global measurement bias and thus can be used to detect global tropospheric ozone trends, but the measurement bias should be considered in certain regions and time periods. 
 Quantifying changes in global and regional tropospheric ozone is critical for understanding global atmospheric chemistry and its impact on air quality and climate. Satellites now provide multi-decadal records of daily global ozone profiles, but previous studies have found large disagreements in satellite-based ozone trends, including in trends from different products based on the same spectral radiances. In light of these disagreements, it is critical to quantify to what degree the observed trend is attributable to measurement error for each product by comparing satellite-retrieved ozone to long-term measurements from ozonesondes. NASA's TRopospheric Ozone and its Precursors from Earth System Sounding (TROPESS) project provides satellite retrievals of ozone from a suite of instruments, including Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS), Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), and multispectral combinations such as AIRS and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) (joint AIRS+OMI) using a common algorithm. We compare these products to ozonesondes and find that the evolution of global tropospheric ozone satellite–sonde biases for TROPESS CrIS (0.21 ± 3.6 % decade−1, 2016–2021), AIRS (−0.41 ± 0.57 % decade−1, 2002–2022), and joint AIRS+OMI (1.1 ± 1.0 % decade−1, 2004–2022) are less than the magnitude of trends in global tropospheric ozone reported by the Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report Phase 1 (TOAR-I). We further quantify the bias in regional trends, which tend to be higher but with a smaller number of sondes, which can impact the satellite–sonde bias and trend.

The results show that the nature of substituents on the carbon chain can effectively affect the decomposition rate of organosulfates, and ozone is unveiled as a complementary oxidant in the intermediate steps of this decomposition. The primary products from these reactions include carbonyl compounds and inorganic sulfate, which highlights the role of organosulfates in altering aerosol chemical composition. 
 Organosulfates are important tracers for aerosol particles, yet their influence on aerosol chemical composition remains poorly understood. This study uses quantum chemical calculations based on density functional theory to explore the reactions of some prevalent organosulfates, specifically methyl sulfate and glycolic acid sulfate, with hydroxyl radicals (HO•) in the gas phase and aqueous phase. Results indicate that all reactions initiate with hydrogen abstraction by HO• from CH3- in methyl sulfate and from -CH2- and -COOH in glycolic acid sulfate, followed by the further reaction of the resulting radicals through self-decomposition, interaction with O2 and, possibly, O3. We found that the hydrogen abstraction from the -COOH group in glycolic acid sulfate could lead to decarboxylation and eventually form similar products as methyl sulfate. The primary reaction products are inorganic sulfate, carbonyl compounds, and formic sulfuric anhydride. Rate constants of 1.14×10-13  and 6.17×10-12 cm3 molec.−1 s−1 at 298.15 K were determined for the gas-phase reactions of methyl sulfate and glycolic acid sulfate, respectively. The former value is consistent with a previous experimental report. Additionally, besides O2 as the primary oxidant in the fragmentation of organosulfates, this study unveils that O3 may be a complementary oxidant in this process, especially in environments enriched with ozone. Overall, this study elucidates mechanisms for HO•-initiated transformation of organosulfates and highlights the potential role of chemical substitution, thereby enhancing our understanding of their atmospheric chemistry and implications for inorganic sulfate formation, which are vital for evaluating their impact on aerosol properties and climate processes."

Thornton,Remote sensing estimates of time-resolved HONO and NO2 emission rates and lifetimes in wildfires,"We present an analysis of high-resolution remote sensing measurements of nitrogen-containing trace gases emitted by wildfires. The measurements were made using an instrument on the NASA ER-2 aircraft in the summer of 2019. We find that time-resolved fire intensity is critical to quantify trace gas emissions over a fire's entire lifespan. These findings have implications for improving air pollution forecasts downwind of wildfires using computer models of atmospheric chemistry and meteorology. 
 Quantification of wildfire emissions is essential for comprehending and simulating the effects of wildfires on atmospheric chemical composition. Sub-orbital measurements of vertical column nitrous acid (HONO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were made during the Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality (FIREX-AQ) field campaign using the GeoCAPE Airborne Simulator (GCAS) instrument on board the NASA ER-2 aircraft. The emission rates and lifetimes of HONO and NO2 from the Sheridan Fire were estimated by fitting exponentially modified Gaussians (EMGs) to line densities, a technique previously used to estimate urban and point source NO2 emissions. As the EMG approach does not capture temporal changes in emissions and lifetimes due to time-varying fire behavior, we developed a Monte Carlo implementation of the Python Editable Chemical Atmospheric Numeric Solver (PECANS) model that includes diurnal fire radiative power (FRP) behavior. We assessed the validity of a range of emission rate and lifetime combinations for both HONO and NO2 as the fire evolves by comparing the resulting line density predictions to the line density observations. We found that our method results in emissions that are lower than top-down biomass burning emissions inventories and higher than bottom-up inventories. Our approach is applicable to interpreting time-resolved remotely sensed measurements of atmospheric trace gases such as those now becoming available with instruments on board geostationary satellites such as the Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) and the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) instruments."

Simulations show its data processing can retrieve fluorescence with high accuracy. These results suggest TanSat-2 will enhance global tracking of the carbon cycle and vegetation health, providing valuable insights for climate change research. 
 Global observations of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) serve as a robust proxy for monitoring vegetation photosynthetic activity and elucidating the terrestrial carbon cycle. To date, several atmospheric remote sensing satellites have been deployed to generate global SIF products. However, accurate mapping of dual-band (red and far-red) SIF with daily temporal resolution and kilometer-level spatial resolution remains a critical gap, despite its significance for various applications. The Chinese next-generation greenhouse gas monitoring satellite, TanSat-2, is set to succeed the original TanSat satellite, aiming to record the fraction of greenhouse gases, pollutants, and SIF measurements from space. According to current schedules, TanSat-2 is slated for launch in 2026. This satellite will feature a wide swath of 2900 km, a high spatial resolution of 2 km at an orbit altitude of 7000 km, and near-daily global coverage. TanSat-2 is equipped with two spectral channels, 747–777 and 672–702 nm, operating at a spectral resolution of 0.12 nm, thereby offering significant potential for mapping SIF in both the red and the far-red bands. In this study, we explore the prospective capabilities of TanSat-2 for SIF retrieval through simulation experiments. First, we simulated the satellite's radiative transfer processes using the Moderate Resolution Atmospheric Transmission 5 (MODTRAN 5) and Soil Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy (SCOPE) models. An end-to-end orbit simulation dataset for TanSat-2 was generated by aggregating global bottom-of-atmosphere (BOA) reflectance, meteorological datasets, and the global Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) SIF dataset (GOSIF). We then assessed the theoretical accuracy of TanSat-2 based on this spectral simulation dataset, yielding root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.24 and 0.19 mW m−2 sr−1 nm−1 for SIF retrievals at 740 and 685 nm, respectively. Finally, we examined the global prospects of TanSat-2 SIF retrievals using the end-to-end orbit simulations. Comparisons between the anticipated TanSat-2 SIF retrievals and GOSIF inputs revealed excellent correlation at both bands, with R2 values of 0.88 and 0.61 and RMSE values of 0.082 and 0.061 mW m−2 sr−1 nm−1, respectively. Thus, TanSat-2 is poised to provide a valuable data resource for reliable SIF retrievals in the red and far-red bands, characterized by high spatiotemporal resolution on a global scale."

MOMA improved the accuracy of PurpleAir sensor data comparable to the EPA correction. Although reliant on nearby reference sites, MOMA offers valuable insights into potential PM sources, thereby increasing the overall value of PurpleAir sensor networks. 
 Air sensors are being used more frequently to measure hyper-local air quality. The PurpleAir sensor is among one of the most popular air sensors used worldwide to measure fine particulate matter (PM2.5). However, there is a need to understand PurpleAir data quality especially under different environmental conditions with varying particulate matter (PM) sources and size distributions. Several correction factors have been developed to make the PurpleAir sensor data more comparable to reference monitor data. The goal of this work was to determine the performance of a remote calibration tool called MOment MAtching (MOMA) for PM2.5 sensors monitoring near temporally varying pollution sources of PM2.5. MOMA performs calibrations using reference site data within 0–15 km from the sensor. Data are from 20 PurpleAir sensors deployed across a network in Phoenix, Arizona, from July 2019 to April 2021. Results showed that the MOMA calibration tool made the PurpleAir PM2.5 data more comparable to the co-located reference data (calibrated mean absolute error (MAE): 2.8–3.7 µg m−3; mean   bias error (MBE): −1.8–0.1 µg m−3). The improvements were comparable to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) correction factor (MAE: 2.8–3.7 µg m−3; MBE: −0.9–0.4 µg m−3). However, MOMA provided a better estimate of daily average concentrations than the EPA correction factor when compared to the reference data under smoke conditions. Using the MOMA gain, representative of the sensor–proxy relationship, MOMA was able to distinguish between PM sources such as winter wood burning, wildfires, and dust events in the summer."

 Continuous ground-based remote sensing measurements were conducted during the Pallas Cloud Experiment (PaCE) 2022 campaign. Remote sensing instruments, including two ceilometers (models CL31 and CL61, Vaisala Oyj), a Doppler cloud radar (model RPG-FMCW-94, RPG Radiometer Physics GmbH), and a Doppler wind lidar (model StreamLine XR, HALO Photonics), were deployed at Kenttärova, Finland, a measurement station that is part of the Pallas Atmosphere–Ecosystem Supersite. The instruments operated continuously throughout the entire campaign, with the exception of a few technical interruptions and brief maintenance periods. The PaCE 2022 remote sensing measurements provided vertical profiles of atmospheric targets with high temporal and vertical resolution, extending from the ground up to an altitude of 10–15 km, depending on the instrument. By combining the data from these instruments and a numerical weather prediction model, cloud microphysical and macrophysical properties – such as ice water content, ice effective radius, and target classification – were retrieved using the Cloudnet methodology.

In this study, we investigate BrC evolution by synthesizing data from one laboratory campaign and four aircraft campaigns spanning diverse spatial scales across North America. To estimate initial conditions for evaluating plume evolution, we develop a method to parametrize the emission ratios of BrC and other species using commonly measured inert tracers, acetonitrile and hydrogen cyanide. The evolution of BrC absorption in the free troposphere is characterized as a function of hydroxyl radical (OH) exposure, yielding an effective photochemical rate constant of 9.7–1.6+4.8 × 10–12 cm3 molecule–1 s–1. The relatively slow reaction rate results in small BrC decay within the first few hours after emission, making it difficult to distinguish from source variability. This helps explain the absence of clear evolutionary trends in near-field studies. Assuming an OH concentration of 1.26 × 106 molecules cm–3, this rate constant corresponds to an e-folding lifetime of approximately 23 h. After extensive photooxidation (OH exposure ∼1012 molecules cm–3 s), 4 ± 2% of the emitted BrC persists, representing a recalcitrant fraction with potential long-term climate impacts. These results improve our understanding of BrC variability and photochemical processing and provide critical constraints for modeling its impacts on climate."

The levels of ∑PFAS exhibit a broad range from 2.9 to 280 pg/m3. Higher concentrations of PFAS at the urban-influenced site compared to the rural site signified spatial variability between the two sampling locations. Despite the absence of a consistent seasonal pattern, concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and neutral PFAS (nPFAS) tend to be higher during the summer months. This pattern appears to be influenced by the seasonal variations of air back trajectories and potential influences from south of the sampling site. The study elucidates potential shifts in atmospheric PFAS dynamics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Applying a modified model with a probabilistic approach, we investigated the transport and fate of PFOA and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) within Lake Ontario. The estimated loadings of PFOA and PFOS from air-to-water were 9.5 ± 3.6 and 17 ± 6.6 kg/y, respectively, close to the values from wet deposition (10 ± 3.9 and 31 ± 12 kg/y, respectively) but much lower than those from inflow and all other sources.

Due to complications in DCC dynamics and microphysics, and aerosol size distribution and composition, understanding aerosol‐DCC interactions has been a daunting challenge. Recently, the convective invigoration mechanisms through enhancing latent heating in condensation and ice‐related processes that have been proposed in literature are debated for their significance qualitatively and quantitatively. A salient issue arising from these debates is the imperative need to clarify essential knowledge and methodologies in investigating aerosol impacts on deep convection. Here we have presented our view of key aspects on investigating and understanding these invigoration mechanisms as well as the aerosol and meteorological conditions under which these mechanisms may be significant based on new findings. For example, the condensational invigoration is most significant under a clean condition with an introduction of a large number of ultrafine particles, and the freezing‐induced invigoration can be significant in a clean condition with a large number of relatively large‐size particles being added. We have made practical recommendations on approaches for investigating aerosol impacts on convection with both modeling and observations. We note that the feedback induced by the invigoration via the enhanced latent heating to circulation and meteorology can be an important part of aerosol impacts but is very complicated and varies with different convective storm types. This is an important future direction for studying aerosol‐DCC interactions."

We estimate the emission rates for carbon dioxide (CO2), CH4, and NOx from the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field during the spring of 2022 using airborne mass balance methods and emission ratios. We also discuss emissions per energy produced and show an increase over time, with values higher than the national average for oil and gas producing regions, though within uncertainties. Our estimates are lower than the NOx emission estimate reported in the National Emissions Inventory (NEI), as seen in other oil and gas studies, but fall within the uncertainty range of the greenhouse gases reported in the GHGRP.

 The fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution has been of great concern. Obtaining full-coverage PM2.5 is still difficult since the limited number of monitoring stations. Satellite datasets with wide spatial coverage and continuous distribution provide a potential solution for estimating full-coverage pollutant concentrations. A two-stage framework based on deep learning was constructed using multi-source satellite data and spatiotemporal variables for daily PM2.5 concentration estimation in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region. Firstly, an AOD imputation model based on linear residual network was proposed. It achieves the best level compared with other methods (R2 = 0.941, RMSE = 0.047). Secondly, a Spatiotemporal Lightweight Parallel Network (STLWPNet) with temporal and spatial modules was constructed to estimate daily PM2.5 concentration. For the first time, the temporal module used firstly Fourier attention and frequency attention to process the frequency domain signal, and introduced a novel second-order residuals algorithm and sequence decomposition for deep mining of temporal information. Meanwhile, the concept of lightweight 2D convolutional layer was innovatively proposed in the spatial module, which can process the spatial information and solve the shortcomings of the traditional methods with large computation. Finally, this model shows outstanding performance in sample-based 10-CV(R2 = 0.917, RMSE = 11.476 μg/m3). This study not only promotes the progress of estimation technology, but also provides a more accurate decision-making basis for the prevention and control of air pollution in the BTH region, which is of great academic and social value."

 This study examines the optical and chemical characteristics of south Asian outflow across the northern Indian Ocean during the northern hemispheric winter of the year 2018, as part of the Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases, and Radiation Budget (ICARB) experiment. Our observations reveal a significant influence of anthropogenic aerosols on columnar aerosol optical depth (AOD) in the equatorial Indian Ocean, with anthropogenic AOD accounting for approximately 46 % of the composite aerosol load. Water-soluble anthropogenic ions (WSAI) emerge as the primary contributor to columnar AOD across most oceanic regions of the northern Indian Ocean, attributed to their high scaling distance compared to other dominant species such as organic carbon (OC) and black carbon (BC). The assessment of speciated aerosol radiative forcing indicates the primary contribution of BC to surface forcing in coastal regions, with WSAI (followed by BC and OC) exerting dominance in far oceanic areas. Overall, anthropogenic forcing, primarily from WSAI, OC, and BC, accounts for a substantial portion of the total forcing at the top of the atmosphere (72 %) and surface (89 %) over most of the cruise regions of the southeast Arabain Sea and the equatorial Indian Ocean, with atmospheric heating predominantly attributed to BC (84 %) exhibiting highest atmospheric absorbing efficiency of 13.38. Our findings highlight the significant role of anthropogenic aerosols from south Asian outflow in shaping optical and radiative properties over the equatorial Indian Ocean and emphasize the need for further research to understand their broader climatic and environmental implications."

 Interpretable machine learning tools have enhanced the ability to model and analyze hourly variations in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations. These tools can distinguish the effects of multiple factors on PM2.5 levels and explore their non-linear relationships with PM2.5. This study analyzes hourly PM2.5 concentrations from two measurement sites in Kathmandu, Nepal, from 2017 to 2023. We use the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to quantify the impacts of forest fires, long-range transport, local emissions, and meteorology on PM2.5 levels. GAM simulation shows that the seasonal temperature component is the dominant driver, explaining 36% of the model variance and indicating strong seasonal influences on PM2.5 concentrations. We use hourly back trajectories, combined with the Fire INventory from NCAR (FINN), to estimate the impact of biomass burning, which contributes approximately 8 μg/m3 of the average 50 μg/m3 PM2.5 at the Phora Durbar site, mainly from Nepal’s forested areas. We determine the impact of long-range transport using Trajectory Cluster Concentration Impacts (TCCI) and observe that northwesterly air masses increase PM2.5 concentrations by up to 4 μg/m3 while southeasterly air masses reduce concentrations by up to 4 μg/m3. Diurnal variations and boundary layer height significantly influence PM2.5 levels, explaining 7% and 6% of the model variance, respectively, representing the influence of local emission. Overall, the GAM framework effectively quantifies the contributions of meteorology, forest fires, long-range transport, and local emissions to PM2.5 concentrations, highlighting the necessity of addressing these factors to improve air quality."

 We developed a strongly coupled aerosol–meteorology four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) assimilation system, CMA-GFS-AERO 4D-Var, for investigating the feedback of aerosol data assimilation on meteorological forecasts. This system was developed on the basis of the framework of the incremental analysis scheme of the China Meteorological Administration Global Forecasting System (CMA-GFS). CMA-GFS-AERO 4D-Var includes three component models: forward, tangent linear, and adjoint models. The CMA-GFS-AERO forward model was constructed by integrating an aerosol module containing the main physical processes of black carbon (BC) aerosol in the atmosphere into the CMA-GFS weather model. The tangent linear model and the adjoint model of the aerosol module were further developed and coupled online with the CMA-GFS tangent linear and adjoint models, respectively. In CMA-GFS-AERO 4D-Var, the BC mass concentration was used as the control variable and minimized together with atmospheric variables. The validation of this system includes the tangent linear approximation, the adjoint correctness test, the single-observation experiment, and the full-observation experiment. The results show that the CMA-GFS-AERO tangent linear model performs well in terms of tangent linear approximation for BC and that adjoint sensitivity agrees well with tangent linear sensitivity. Assimilating BC observations can generate analysis increments not only for BC but also for atmospheric variables, highlighting the capability of CMA-GFS-AERO 4D-Var in exploring the feedback of BC assimilation on atmospheric variables. The computational performance of CMA-GFS-AERO 4D-Var also indicates its potential in operational application.

During a mid‐latitude snowfall event, rapid HONO enrichment was observed alongside concurrent depletion of other pollutants. This unexpected phenomenon is attributed to heterogeneous reactions on fresh snow's high surface area, an interpretation supported by HONO budget parameterization. In contrast, aged snowpack exhibited negligible production potential, contradicting prior snowpack source identifications. This divergence arises from snow aging processes that reduce surface area and alter chemical reactivity. These findings reveal previously unrecognized meteorology‐chemistry interactions, underscoring further investigation into these complex processes."

 Organic nitrates (ONs) are crucial constituents of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs). The liquid-phase degradation of ONs alters the light-absorbing properties of aerosols, thereby influencing the direct radiative effect (DRE) and climate dynamics. Alkyl nitrates (ANs) contribute most of ONs. Previous studies have shown that hydrolysis and •OH-initiated oxidation are two competing degradation pathways for ANs, with oxidation being the dominant mechanism under weakly acidic or weakly alkaline conditions. However, experimental •OH concentrations (ppm) are ten orders of magnitude higher than actual, likely underestimating hydrolysis's contribution. Using propyl nitrate isomers as proxies, we combined liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and quantum calculations to re-explore AN's degradation at pH 1–8. Our results show that hydrolysis dominates at realistic •OH levels. Specifically, compared to previous experimental results, hydrolysis is underestimated by 80 % under pH 4–8, resulting in underrating AN's lifetime by 5 orders. Consequently, the resulting light-absorbing attenuation of aerosol will be disregarded, possibly leading to inaccurate DRE and climate effect assessments in oceanic/desert regions where aerosols at pH 4–8 predominates. Our research emphasizes the need to re-evaluate the role of hydrolysis in predicting the fate of ANs and the light-absorbing properties of aerosols."

 While winter has traditionally been the focus of air quality research in South Korea, early summer also experiences high levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), largely driven by elevated ammonia (NH3) emissions from agricultural activities. The South Korean government decided to reduce agricultural-based NH3 emissions by 30 % in the Special Act on Fine Aerosol to reduce the levels of PM2.5 due to the significant contributions of NH3 to the formation of secondary inorganic aerosols. In this study, we utilized the CMAQ v5.2.1 model to simulate air quality over East Asia during the KORUS-AQ campaign (1 May – June 12, 2016) and evaluate the accuracy of the NH3 emission, their impacts on PM2.5, and the effectiveness of various emission control strategies, particularly in South Korea. The accuracy of NH3 emissions was evaluated by comparing model-predicted NH3 concentrations with the EANET and AMoN-China networks and with the MARGA equipment in Seoul. The comparison at 60 monitoring stations revealed negative mean biases in China (often exceeding 10 μg m−3), indicating a possible underestimation of NH3 emissions in the KORUSv5.0 inventory in most parts of China except for some overestimations in Henan and Sichuan provinces. On the other hand, biases were smaller in South Korea and Japan, ranging from −3.80 to 2.99 ppb (or −2.68 to 2.11 μg m−3 at the standard ambient temperature and pressure). We found from the sensitivity simulations by incrementally reducing NH3 emissions in South Korea from 0 % to 100 % that NH3 reductions lead to lower aerosol pH and decreased nitrate partitioning (e.g., from 1.31 to −0.54 and from 0.40 to 0.05 for SK, respectively). In addition, the South Korean government's reduction policy of NH3 emissions can improve the mean concentration of PM2.5 between 0.59 and 1.31 μg m−3 in South Korea. Chemical regime analysis concludes that South Korea exhibits NH3-rich conditions, where NOx plays a more dominant role in nitrate formation. Furthermore, the sensitivity simulations of the multi-pollutant reductions indicate that i) a 40 % of NH3 and SO2 & NOx, ii) a 60 % of NH3, or iii) a 60 % reduction of SO2 & NOx emissions are required to achieve a 10 % decrease in PM2.5 in South Korea."

In this case study from Mohali, India, we show that a unique combination of volatile organic compound (VOC)-based source apportionment in combination with a dense network of monitoring grade air pollutant observations and a few low-cost sensors can collectively identify and locate the sources of criteria air pollutants impacting a receptor site. The study uses ambient chemical composition measurements from the COVID-19 pandemic-induced lockdown in 2020. The key drivers of pollutant reductions were the 74 ± 4% reduction in transport activity between prelockdown and postlockdown, accompanied by a 63 ± 5% drop in traffic VOC emission and a 96 (80–100)% drop in NO emissions. Reductions in industrial activity and power demand caused a 53 ± 3% drop in industrial VOC emissions and 67 ± 5% drop in SO2 emissions, as well as a 59 ± 3% reduction in open waste burning during lockdown, which resulted in 43 ± 2% and 39 ± 1% reductions in PM2.5 and PM10 emissions, respectively.

However, quantifying the relationship between cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration remains challenging due to extensive heterogeneities in cloud properties, processes occurring during cloud lifecycle, and observational uncertainties. This study integrates satellite observations with a global climate model and employs advanced statistical techniques to improve estimates of cloud droplet susceptibility to aerosol perturbations, particularly focusing on the CCN‐CDNC slope. A key challenge in determining this relationship is that CDNC is influenced by factors beyond CCN alone, such as atmospheric dynamics and cloud microphysics. These additional factors introduce variability that complicates direct correlation between CCN and CDNC, making it difficult to ascertain their true relationship. In addition, traditional methods like Ordinary Least Squares regression can produce biased slope estimates due to uncertainties in both CCN and CDNC measurements. When applied to CCN‐CDNC data, advanced curve fitting methods, such as bivariate least squares, often yield slopes exceeding 1, deviating from expected physical behavior. Our machine learning analysis identifies updraft velocity, among other key predictors, as a major factor leading to this larger‐than‐one slope between CCN and CDNC. To address this, we utilized Elastic Net Regression to isolate the effect of changes in CCN concentration on CDNC. This method refines the slope estimates by accounting for factors affecting CDNC, resulting in a slope that better captures the susceptibility of CDNC to CCN changes."

 As dense sensor networks for air quality monitoring become increasingly prevalent, effective calibration remains a critical yet challenging component of their operation, particularly for large-scale networks. Conventional calibration methods, which rely heavily on co-locating sensors with reference monitors for learning and training, often face significant scalability challenges, rendering them impractical for post-deployment recalibration. To address this limitation, we propose an in-situ baseline calibration method (b-SBS) that calibrates sensors remotely without the need for direct co-location. This approach is grounded in the physical characteristics of electrochemical sensors and is informed by statistical analyses of calibration coefficients across a large group of similar sensors. Through preliminary field tests conducted on a batch of sensors for NO2, NO, CO, and O3, two key linear calibration coefficients, sensitivity and baseline, were systematically investigated. Sensitivity analysis of over 100 short-term calibration samples for each gas revealed coefficients clustered within 20% variation, enabling universal parameterization. Long-term baseline drift remained stable within ±5 ppb for NO2, NO, and O3, and ±100 ppb for CO over 6 months, supporting semi-annual recalibration. Applying the b-SBS calibration approach to 73 NO2 sensors in a large-scale Shanghai network yielded pronounced data quality improvements compared to their original measurements (initially calibrated before deployment): the median R2 increased by 45.8% (from 0.48 to 0.70), and RMSE decreased by 52.6% (from 16.02 to 7.59 ppb), as validated against nearby reference stations. The Shanghai application, while showing the method’s potential for large-scale deployments, awaits further real-time validation to confirm its robustness under diverse operational conditions. This study is a valuable advancement in calibration strategies, offering a cost-effective solution that reduces operational costs while ensuring accurate measurements across numerous sensors and long-term network deployments."

 An in-situ field study was conducted during the pre-monsoon season in the Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon, located in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP), to investigate the physicochemical properties of aerosols and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity associated with South Asian outflow. This region serves as a critical water vapor channel into the interior of the TP. During the study, periodic episodes of enhanced aerosol loading were observed, with the maximum of daily average submicron aerosol mass concentrations exceeding 20 μg m−3, substantially higher than typical background levels over the inland TP. The average aerosol composition during the study was dominated by organic aerosols (OA, 57.0 %), followed by sulfate (21.1 %), black carbon (12.1 %), ammonium (7.3 %), nitrate (2.3 %), and chloride (0.2 %). The contribution of OA increased during elevated loading periods, whereas sulfate contributions declined. The high contribution of OA resulted in an overall moderate hygroscopicity of aerosols (κchem = 0.27). Despite the moderate hygroscopicity, aerosols presented relatively high CCN activity ratios (0.5–0.8 for supersaturation between 0.2 % and 1.0 %), primarily due to their size distribution in the accumulation mode after long-range transport. Case studies further indicate potential aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions during pollution episodes. These results improve our understanding of the transport and evolution processes of South Asian outflow and their implications for regional water-cycling during the pre-monsoon season."

 The western United States has experienced a significant increase in the frequency and severity of wildfires, driven by climate change, human activity, and fire suppression strategies. These wildfires generate pollution that adversely affects air quality long distances from the source and with impacts lasting from minutes to days. The Warn-on-Forecast System for Smoke (WoFS-Smoke) provides short-term (0–6 h) forecasts focused on smoke from rapidly evolving wildfires. The system utilizes Fire Radiative Power (FRP) data from the GOES-East and West satellites to estimate smoke emissions. The injection height of biomass burning emissions are then estimated at each grid point using the Freitas plume model that is also utilized by the operational HRRR-Smoke system. One limitation of this system was its inability to incorporate the estimated vertical velocity within the 1-D column back into the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, hindering accurate predictions of vertical smoke aerosol transport and pyro-cumulus (pyro-Cu) formation. WoFS-Smoke addresses this limitation by incorporating the vertical velocity profile, as estimated by the Freitas plume model, back into WoFS-Smoke. This enhancement enables the system to provide a more accurate vertical structure of smoke and the potential to forecast the development of smoke-induced pyro-Cu. The improved capabilities were demonstrated through its application to three wildfire events in California, New Mexico, and Texas occurring in 2020 and 2024. We will also assess limitations with this initial development and discuss the next steps at refining the fire – atmosphere coupling in WoFS."

 Aerosols, which envelop the entire Earth, significantly influence climate, environmental quality, and human health. Aerosol mapping is essential for understanding their interactions with meteorological and epidemiological factors, especially in regions with sparse ground stations. However, existing aerosol products face limitations in spatial coverage and resolution. To bridge this gap, we present a novel two-stage hybrid algorithm to generate seamless 1-km aerosol optical depth (AOD) maps across China from 2014 to 2023. In the first stage, an ensemble machine learning model is used to calibrate Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) AOD using same-day Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol retrieval. The calibrated MERRA-2 AOD is then used to fill gaps in the MODIS-derived product (i.e., MCD19A2), producing spatially complete aerosol maps as supervision labels. Subsequently, the second stage employs the labels and an enhanced Downscale-UNet model incorporating Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and Depthwise Separable Convolution (DSC) modules to enhance spatial feature extraction and computational efficiency, ultimately obtaining seamless and high-resolution results through a surface-to-surface learning paradigm. Validation results show that the proposed model outperforms the conventional UNet by approximately 5 %, with a high determination coefficient (R2) of 0.93 and low root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.06 on the testing dataset. Independent validation against ground-based observations confirms its satisfactory performance with improved accuracy (R2 = 0.75) compared to MERRA-2 (R2 = 0.48) and superior spatial coverage (100 %) compared to MCD19A2 (44 %). Moreover, its spatial results demonstrate exceptional continuity and fine-scale feature representation, effectively bridging the complementary limitations of satellite retrievals and reanalysis data.

 East Asia has historically experienced high atmospheric aerosol concentrations, particularly during winter, when aerosol optical depth (AOD) reaches its peak level and exhibits significant variability. This study investigated the long-term variability of wintertime AOD over East Asia, including statistical associations with emission trends from the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR), climate factors including the Western Pacific Oscillation (WPO), East Asian Jet Stream Index (EAJSI), Siberian High Index (SHI), and Arctic Sea Ice Index (ASI) in December–February from 2000 to 2022. An empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis revealed that although reductions in both NOₓ and SO2 emissions have significantly contributed to a long-term decrease in AOD, the pronounced intra-seasonal and interannual variability suggests additional influences from climate factors. The most prominent EOF mode of AOD variability was observed in February, along with strong associations with the SHI, EAWMI, and EAJSI. Climate indices related to the EAWMI exerted a stronger influence in late winter (February), partly due to intensified mid-latitude westerlies during the mature phase of the EAWMI. In contrast, the WPO primarily influenced early-winter AOD variability (December–January) by altering upper-level pressure patterns over the western Pacific, enhancing the EAJSI and modulating AOD distribution across the China–Korea region—a pattern that has become more evident in recent years. Furthermore, the rapid decline in Arctic Sea ice during early winter appeared to strengthen both the SHI and the EAJSI, leading to a decrease in AOD by late winter. These findings highlight the increasing importance of climate factors in influencing wintertime AOD over East Asia."

We found an average of 56.5 foehn days annually, primarily in winter. These winds can raise temperatures significantly and are associated with air pollution levels. Strong foehn winds tend to reduce pollution, while weaker winds may increase it. Our study highlights the impact of foehn events on air quality, providing valuable insights for urban planning and environmental management. 
 This study proposes a method for identifying foehn events in Beijing using automatic weather station (AWS) data, considering upper-air wind direction, topography, meteorological changes, and foehn propagation. Analysis of AWS data from 2015 to 2020 revealed an annual average of 56.5 foehn days, with these days occurring most frequently in winter and least frequently in summer. High-frequency foehn areas exhibit a band-like distribution from the northwestern mountainous region to the southeastern plains, while low-frequency areas are primarily concentrated in the northeastern plains. The horizontal extent of the foehn influence is maximal in spring and minimal in summer. Foehn-induced hourly temperature increases can exceed 11 °C, peaking from night to early morning. Approximately 67 % of pollution episodes are accompanied by foehn events, with foehn duration negatively correlated to pollution episode duration. 60.4 % of foehn events coincide with decreasing concentrations of particulate matter of 2.5 µm diameter (PM2.5), while 39.6 % show increases. Rapid PM2.5 concentration increases (>50 µgm-3h-1) primarily correspond to weak foehn events (temperature increase <2 °C). Foehn winds influence pollution through direct and indirect effects. The direct effect, associated with strong northwesterly pressure gradients, can rapidly decrease pollutant concentrations. The indirect effect, linked to weak pressure gradients, alters the boundary-layer structure, causing rapid increases in pollutant concentrations following the termination of foehn. This foehn identification method, applicable to long-term historical surface observations, not only facilitates a deeper understanding of how foehn phenomena evolve and contribute to temperature increases under global warming, but also advances an in-depth exploration of the relationships between foehn events and high-impact weather phenomena."

Cohen;Glenn M. Wolfe;Xiaomeng Jin,Impacts of wildfire smoke aerosols on near-surface ozone photochemistry,"This study shows large chemical and radiative effects of smoke aerosols from fires on near-surface ozone production. Aerosol loading and NOx levels are identified as the primary factors influencing these effects. Furthermore, we show that the ratio of surface PM2.5 to NO2 tropospheric column can be used as an indicator for identifying aerosol-dominated regimes, facilitating the assessment of aerosol impacts on ozone formation through satellite observations. 
 Wildfires have been an increasing concern for the environment, yet the ozone (O3) production from wildfires remains poorly characterized. Here, we aim to elucidate the role of aerosols from wildfire smoke in near-surface O3 photochemistry by integrating insights from a 0-D box model (F0AM) to a 3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). While smoke aerosols typically inhibit O3 production through heterogeneous chemical and radiative pathways, we find that for most fires, the O3 enhancement driven by precursor emissions outweighs these aerosol-driven suppression effects. The relative importance of the two aerosol effects varies, with the heterogeneous chemical effect generally overshadowing the radiative effect in the far field of fires. However, near the sources of extremely large fires, the radiative effect dominates, leading to an overall suppression of O3 production. By assessing the chain termination of hydrogen oxide radicals (HOx) and introducing the “light-limited” regime determination in GEOS-Chem, we find that a significant portion of O3 production occurred within light-limited and heterogeneous chemistry-inhibited regimes during the 2020 wildfire season in California. Building on the discovery that both aerosol and nitrogen oxide (NOx) concentrations modulate aerosol influence, we demonstrate that the ratio of surface PM2.5 to tropospheric NO2 column – a metric retrievable from satellite – can serve as an indicator for identifying aerosol-dominated regimes through observations."

GEMS provides hourly data, improving the time resolution compared to the daily overpasses by other satellites. For the prediction of hourly surface NO2 over South Korea from GEMS observations and meteorological data, this study shows that machine learning models benefit from this higher time resolution. This is achieved by using observations from previous hours as additional inputs. 
 Launched in 2020, the Korean Geostationary Environmental Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) is the first geostationary satellite mission for observing trace gas concentrations in the Earth's atmosphere. Observations are made over Asia. Geostationary orbits allow for hourly measurements, which lead to a much higher temporal resolution compared to daily measurements taken from low-Earth orbits, such as by the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) or the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). This work estimates the hourly concentration of surface nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from GEMS tropospheric NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) and additional meteorological features, which serve as inputs for random forests and linear regression models. With several measurements per day, machine learning models can use not only current observations but also those from previous hours as inputs. We demonstrate that using these time-contiguous inputs leads to reliable improvements regarding all considered performance measures, such as Pearson correlation or mean square error. For random forests, the average performance gains are between 4.5 % and 7.5 %, depending on the performance measure. For linear regression models, average performance gains are between 7 % and 15 %. For performance evaluation, spatial cross-validation with surface in situ measurements is used to measure how well the trained models perform at locations where they have not received any training data. In other words, we inspect the models' ability to generalize to unseen locations. Additionally, we investigate the influence of tropospheric NO2 VCDs on the performance.

The merged datasets exhibit significantly improved accuracy compared to the original satellite data. These results can provide more reliable estimates of aerosol scattering and absorption properties, essential for improving climate modeling and assessing aerosol climate effects. 
 Accurate global aerosol single-scattering albedo (SSA) data are critical for assessing aerosol radiative effects and identifying aerosol composition. However, current satellite-based SSA retrievals are both limited and highly uncertain, whereas the more accurate ground-based observations lack global coverage. In this study, we employ an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data synergy technique to construct two monthly mean SSA datasets over land by synergizing the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectance (POLDER) instrument with Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observations, namely, the Merged-OMI and Merged-POLDER datasets. The background ensemble is constructed with 231/106 members using all monthly mean OMI/POLDER SSA available to represent the variability of the SSA field. Then, AERONET measurements are assimilated into each satellite dataset using the EnKF approach. The merged datasets show substantial improvements against the original products, with the correlation coefficient increased by up to 100 % and the mean absolute bias (MAB) and root mean square error (RMSE) reduced by more than 30 % compared with the AERONET results. Cross-validation using independent AERONET observations shows an average increase of 64 % in correlation, an 11 % reduction in RMSE, and a 10 % reduction in MAB for the Merged-OMI dataset, as well as similar – although weaker – improvement for Merged-POLDER mainly due to the smaller sample size. This study confirms the effectiveness of the EnKF technique in extending the information obtained from ground stations to larger regions. The two merged datasets generated in this study, available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14294462 (Dong, 2025), can offer more accurate SSA estimates for assessing aerosol radiative forcing and improving climate modeling, serving as an important resource for advancing global aerosol research."

It features a detailed resolution of the emissions in different subsectors, transport-specific quantities like non-exhaust emissions, and aviation-specific parameters. The ELK dataset is complemented with uncertainty scores and is validated against other well-established global inventories. 
 The transport sectors, comprising land transport, shipping and aviation, are major contributors to climate change and have a detrimental impact on air quality, with adverse consequences for human health. The emissions from transport, already contributing 23 % of total anthropogenic CO2 emissions in 2019, are projected to continuously grow in the future, challenging the achievement of climate protection and pollution reduction targets. A major goal of transport research on climate and air quality is the accurate assessment of its impacts, which requires detailed emission data to drive atmospheric models and calculate projections for future scenarios. This paper presents the ELK global emission inventory for the transport sectors. The inventory is developed using a consistent bottom-up approach fed with a wide range of input data to model the transport fleets of land transport, shipping and aviation. It provides several major improvements over existing datasets, such as the explicit resolution of the emissions at the subsector level, the consideration of transport-specific quantities and emission species, and the quantification of the transport-related emissions from the energy sectors. The emission data is complemented by a quantitative uncertainty score, based on a detailed expert-judgement analysis along the modelling chain, from the activity data to the emission factors. The emission data is validated by comparing it with other, well-established global inventories, and biases are discussed and, where possible, explained in terms of the different assumptions and features of the underlying emission models.

We recommend small modifications to functions in the algorithm to improve its performance. Implementing the changes in the UK Met Office climate model reduced average bias in simulated global droplet number concentrations, leading to more reflected solar radiation and a net cooling effect. 
 The representation of aerosol activation is a key source of uncertainty in global composition-climate model simulations of aerosol–cloud interactions.  The Abdul-Razzak and Ghan (ARG) activation parameterization is used in several global and regional models that employ modal aerosol microphysics schemes. In this study, we investigate the ability of the ARG parameterization to reproduce simulations with a cloud parcel model and find its performance is sensitive to the geometric standard deviations (widths) of the lognormal aerosol modes. We recommend adjustments to three constant parameters in the ARG equations, which improve the performance of the parameterization for small mode widths and its ability to simulate activation in polluted conditions. For the accumulation mode width of 1.4 used in the Met Office Unified Model (UM), the modifications decrease the mean bias in the activated fraction of aerosols compared to a cloud parcel model from −6.6 % to +1.2 %. We implemented the improvements in the UM and compared simulated global cloud droplet concentrations with satellite observations. The simulated cloud radiative effect changes by −1.43 W m−2 (6 %) and aerosol indirect radiative forcing over the industrial period changes by −0.10 W m−2 (10 %)."

During the years 2011–2020, the oxic CH4 photoproduction potential in China’s lakes (>100 km2) ranged from 2.21e-7 to 5.97e-6 mol (CH4) m–2 day–1. Deep oligotrophic lakes in western China, particularly the Tibetan Plateau, exhibited a higher CH4 photoproduction potential compared to shallow eutrophic lakes in the eastern regions. Globally, the oxic photoproduction potential of CH4 from lakes (>100 km2) averaged 1.27e-6 mol (CH4) m–2 day–1 during 2011–2020. Lakes in higher latitudes (>60°) exhibited generally lower CH4 photoproduction rates, whereas those in equatorial regions (−20° ≤ latitude ≤ 20°) and high-altitude areas (>4000 m) showed overall higher rates. It was estimated that the oxic CH4 photoproduction process of inland lakes accounted for 0.1–22% of diffusive CH4 fluxes on a global scale, and the total oxic CH4 photoproduction budget of global lakes is estimated to be 0.0104 Tg CH4/year.

We introduce a novel approach to identify a reduced number of representative cases from a wide array of observed environmental conditions prevalent in the Northeast Pacific. We create over 2200 trajectories from observations and use cloud-resolving simulations to investigate how marine low clouds evolve in two different cases. It is shown that aerosols can delay cloud breakup, but their impact depends on precipitation. 
 As the evolution of marine low clouds is sensitive to the current state of the atmosphere and varying meteorological forcing, it is crucial to ascertain how cloud responses differ across a spectrum of those conditions. In this study, we introduce an innovative approach to encompass a wide array of conditions prevalent in low marine cloud regions by creating a comprehensive library of observed environmental conditions. Using reanalysis and satellite data, over 2200 Lagrangian trajectories are generated within the stratocumulus deck region of the Northeast Pacific during summer 2018–2021. By using eight important cloud-controlling factors (CCFs), we employ principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of data. This technique demonstrates that two principal components capture 43 % of the variability among CCFs. Notably, PCA facilitates the selection of a reduced number of trajectories (e.g., 54) that represent a diverse array of the observed CCF, aerosol, and cloud variability and co-variability. These trajectories can then be used for process model studies, e.g., with large-eddy simulations (LES), to evaluate the efficacy of marine cloud brightening. Two distinct cases are selected to initiate 2 d long, high-resolution, large-domain LES experiments. The results highlight the ability of our LES to simulate observed conditions. Although perturbed aerosols delay cloud breakup and enhance the cloud radiative effect, the strength of such effects is sensitive to “precipitation-aerosol feedback”. The first case is precipitating and shows the potential for “precipitation-driven” cloud breakup due to positive precipitation-aerosol feedback. The second case is non-precipitating with classic cloud breakup of the “deepening-warming” type, highlighting the impact of entrainment."

This long-range transport induces widespread haziness over southern India, lasting for days. We evaluated the occurrence of such transport episodes over southern India using observational methods and found that it suppresses the boundary layer height by approximately 40 % compared to clear days, while exacerbating the surface pollution by approximately 50 %–60 %. 
 Anticyclonic wind circulation is prevalent over India during the winter season, causing advection of air masses from northern India towards southeastern coastal Indian and the adjoining Bay of Bengal (BoB) regions. In this study, we use a synergy of satellite, radiosonde, and ground-based measurements to characterize the phenomenon of regional transport episodes (RTEs) and their impact on the boundary layer height and air quality over Chennai, a tropical South Asian megacity. The long-term satellite data and back-trajectory analysis enable us to detect the occurrence of RTE over Chennai, which persists for a duration of 2–4 d. The transported aerosol is generally located at altitudes of ∼ 1–3 km along the eastern coast of India. The duration of these RTEs in the winter season over Chennai accounts for ∼ 10 %–15 % of the days, which demonstrates an increasing trend over the last decade. Radiosonde analysis over the five sites located en route to the transport pathway illustrates distinct aerosol-associated warming (1–1.5 K) at altitudes corresponding to these elevated layers and hence a strong enhancement in lower-tropospheric stability during the RTE. In agreement, the regional aerosol/haze transport significantly reduces the boundary layer height to less than 1 km compared to haze-free (clear) days (∼ 2–2.5 km), mainly during the ensuing period of boundary layer evolution over the eastern coast. Consequently, an increase in PM2.5 concentration over Chennai is observed (∼ 50 %–60 %) during RTE compared to background days. This study provides robust observational evidence of the importance of regional transport of aerosols for the air quality of downwind megacities and warrants more observational and modeling studies in the future."

Robinson;Steven S. Brown;Pete M. Edwards,The determination of ClNO2 via thermal dissociation–tunable infrared laser direct absorption spectroscopy,"Nitryl chloride (ClNO2) is a reservoir of chlorine atoms and nitrogen oxides, both of which play important roles in atmospheric chemistry. However, all ambient ClNO2 observations so far have been made by a single technique, mass spectrometry, which needs complex calibrations. Here, we present a laser-based method that detects ClNO2 (TD-TILDAS – thermal dissociation–tunable infrared laser direct absorption spectrometry) without the need for complicated calibrations. The results show excellent agreement between these two methods from both laboratory and ambient samples. 
 Nitryl chloride (ClNO2) is a reservoir species of chlorine atoms and nitrogen oxides, both of which play important roles in atmospheric chemistry. To date, all ambient ClNO2 observations have been obtained by chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS). In this work, thermal dissociation–tunable infrared laser direct absorption spectrometry (TD-TILDAS) is shown to be a viable method for quantifying ClNO2 in laboratory and field settings. This technique relies on the thermal dissociation of ClNO2 to create chlorine radicals, which undergo fast reactions with hydrocarbons to produce hydrogen chloride (HCl) that is detectable by the TILDAS instrument. Complete quantitative conversion of ClNO2 to HCl was achieved at temperatures > 400 °C, achieving 1 Hz measurement precision of 11 ± 1 pptv (3σ limits of detection of 34 ± 2 pptv) during laboratory comparisons with other ClNO2 detection methods. After blank and line loss corrections, method accuracy is estimated to be within ± 5 %. Performance metrics of TD-TILDAS during ambient sampling were a 1 Hz precision of 19 ± 1 pptv and 3σ limits of detection of 57 ± 3 pptv, which is directly comparable to previously reported ClNO2 detection by quadrupole CIMS. Thus, TD-TILDAS can provide an alternative analytical approach for a direct measurement of ClNO2 that can complement existing datasets and future studies. The quantitative nature of TD-TILDAS also makes it a potentially useful tool for the calibration of CIMS instruments. However, interpretation of ambient data may be complicated by potential interferences from unaccounted-for sources of thermolabile chlorine, such as ClNO, chloramines, and organochlorides."

We collocated an array of PurpleAir (PA-II-SD) sensors alongside a beta attenuation monitor (BAM: MetOne BAM-1020) across the dry and wet seasons. Specifically, we collocated 10 sensors during the wet season and 20 sensors during the dry season, collecting one month of colocation data per season, covering a wide range of pollution levels and meteorological conditions. Quality-assured hourly concentrations from different PurpleAir units have shown good consistency, with pairwise R2 values generally exceeding 0.95. We developed empirical correction models by testing 29 multiple linear regression (MLR) forms and Random Forest models. Results showed that for hourly average PM2.5 concentrations measured by PurpleAir, a simple linear correction model achieved an accuracy (nRMSE) within 17–18% of hourly BAM measurements. More complex MLR models incorporating several meteorological variables and interaction terms improved accuracy (nRMSE) slightly, to ∼15%. Random Forest models slightly outperformed all MLR models, at 12–14% (nRMSE) accuracy relative to BAM. Our findings highlight that existing correction models─particularly those developed for U.S. cities and used in the PurpleAir map─are inadequate for Bangladeshi conditions. Uncorrected PurpleAir cf_atm PM2.5 data yielded accuracy within 25% of BAM measurements. Further research is needed to assess sensor performance in rural and suburban environments and to evaluate long-term performance under diverse climatological and source conditions in Bangladesh and South Asia."

 Over the past decade, nearly ten satellites dedicated to atmospheric CO2 concentration monitoring have been launched, significantly advancing our understanding of the global carbon cycle. In 2022, China launched the DaQi-1 (DQ-1) satellite, which carries the Aerosol and Carbon Dioxide Lidar (ACDL)—the first spaceborne lidar sensor for CO2 monitoring. Relying on laser-based active sensing, ACDL serves as an important complement to existing passive optical CO2 satellite missions. This study aims to introduce the scientific community to the XCO2 retrieval methodology of ACDL and to release all available data from the satellite's first year in orbit. The first version of ACDL XCO2 products scheduled for release is called “v1.0”. Preliminary validation shows that the ACDL XCO2 product achieves an accuracy of 0.02 ± 1.4 ppm. At a 0.5° spatial resolution, monthly products provide valid observations for 87.6 % of global grid cells. This study also presents, for the first time, a comparison between total column XCO2 and partial column XCO2 above clouds, as well as diurnal differences in XCO2 concentrations. Furthermore, we demonstrate ACDL's capability to track temporal variations in atmospheric CO2 using time series from six representative regions. Nonetheless, challenges remain, including reliance on meteorological reanalysis data and uncertainties in spectroscopic parameters. In future product versions, we plan to improve data quality through enhanced denoising techniques and signal processing methods for low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) cases. We hope that this initial analysis of the ACDL XCO2 product will spark broader interest and participation from the scientific community, thereby contributing fresh momentum to climate change research."

 Formaldehyde (HCHO) is a carcinogenic pollutant and a key precursor of ground-level ozone (O3) and PM2.5. To improve the accuracy of ozone forecasting and source identification, it is necessary to carry out comprehensive statistics on the source emission of HCHO. In this study, a comprehensive anthropogenic HCHO emission inventory was established for the Central China, with Henan Province as a representative in 2019. Results show that HCHO emissions were 25.2 kt, with the main sources being on-road mobile, biomass burning, non-road mobile and solvent utilization, accounting for 36.4%, 25.4%, 14.1% and 12.1%, respectively. There were significant differences in the monthly emission characteristics of different sources. On-road mobile and solvent utilization emissions showed relatively stable in all months of the year and biomass burning was concentrated in June and October. The spatial analysis showed that HCHO emissions was mainly concentrated in densely populated, industrial and agricultural areas. Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis showed that the uncertainty range for the total HCHO emission inventory was (−52.3%, 51.4%). In addition, the monthly trend of primary HCHO emission based on remote sensing inversion closely matches that of the emission inventory. Spatially, the high emission areas identified by remote sensing inversion were mainly located in the central and northern parts of Henan. The overall correlation coefficient (R2) was 0.75, consistent with the spatial distribution of the emission inventory. It hopes to better understand the emission characteristics of HCHO and provide more detailed basic data for air quality control policies."

 As in most European countries, the impact of Air Quality policy in Belgium is monitored with an accurate but relatively sparse network of instruments measuring in situ the near-surface concentration of various pollutants. Assessment at unmeasured locations is based on interpolation techniques and/or numerical models. We demonstrate how today’s dedicated satellite data sets for AQ, and in particular Sentinel-5 Precursor TROPOMI NO2 , can be used in conjunction with the near-surface data to assess AQ over the entire Belgian domain in an observational approach virtually independent from assumptions on (changing) emissions. Specifically, after temporal aggregation and spatial oversampling (1x1km2), these satellite data reveal policy-relevant spatial and temporal features, and a high correlation (r∼0.9) with the near-surface measurements where these are available, in particular when adjusting the latter for local representativeness with land-cover data. This tight relation allows for a pragmatic conversion of tropospheric columns to near-surface concentrations over the entire Belgian domain using Regression Kriging, yielding uncertainties (∼12%) well below the amplitude of the larger spatio-temporal features over Belgium. This synergistic product, named LEGO-4-AQ, is evaluated against the Belgian assessment model RIO, revealing good agreement (r∼0.85) but also interesting local deviations. Both satellite tropospheric vertical column densities and synergistic near-surface concentrations are found to have decreased by 3-10%/year over the period 2019-2024, with midday values at a 4x4km2 resolution now mostly below the WHO annual (all-day) exposure guideline of 10μg/m3. The three urban low-emission zones already in place in Belgium do not (yet) show stronger reductions than those observed in other (sub-)urban parts of the country."

 Climate change is driving more frequent and severe dry and wet heatwaves, yet a clear picture of how each type influences ozone (O3) production in areas characterized by intricate industry and geography are still lacking. This study examines O3 formation during heatwaves, focusing on interactions among meteorological factors, atmospheric chemistry, and pollutant emissions in a unique industrial area at the junction of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui provinces of northern China in summer 2022 and 2023. This study integrates hourly data of temperature, relative humidity (RH), solar radiation (SF), 115 VOCs, and other atmospheric pollutants, and quantifies the contribution of each factor using machine learning models combined with SHAP. Results show that SF is the main driver influencing O3, contributing 13.7 μg/m3 during dry heatwaves and 5.0 μg/m3 during wet heatwaves. RH and atmospheric diffusion conditions are distinct between the dry and wet heatwaves. PMF indicates that industrial emissions dominate O3 formation during dry heatwaves while biogenic VOCs dominate during wet heatwaves. For VOCs, during dry heatwaves the SHAP values for styrene, propene and isoprene were 9.1, 4.4 and 3.8 μg/m3, respectively, significantly affecting O3 formation; In wet heatwaves, styrene, propene and acetaldehyde dominate, with SHAP values of 6.7, 4.3 and 2.5 μg/m3 respectively. Diurnal analysis indicates that while styrene and propene boost O3 during daytime (9:00–17:00), their effects reverse in the early morning (6:00–8:00). In contrast, isoprene contributes positively (2.85 μg/m3) during dry heatwaves and negatively (−2.92 μg/m3) during wet ones. Overall, the study offers an efficient framework for understanding O3 formation in extreme weather and informs targeted pollution control strategies."

Bollasina;Wenjun Zhang;Ying Xiang,Response of the link between the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the East Asian winter monsoon to Asian anthropogenic sulfate aerosols,"Using multi-model mean data from regional aerosol perturbation experiments, we find that increased Asian sulfate aerosols strengthen the link between ENSO (El Niño–Southern Oscillation) and the East Asian winter monsoon. In coupled simulations, aerosol-induced broad cooling increases the ENSO amplitude by affecting the tropical Pacific mean state, contributing to the increase in monsoon interannual variability. These results provide important implications to reduce uncertainties in future projections of regional extreme variability. 
 We use coupled and atmosphere-only simulations from the Precipitation Driver and Response Model Intercomparison Project (PDRMIP) to investigate the impacts of Asian anthropogenic sulfate aerosols on the link between the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM). In fully coupled simulations, aerosol-induced cooling extends southeastward to the Maritime Continent and the northwestern Pacific. Remotely, this broad cooling weakens the easterly trade winds over the central Pacific, which reduces the east–west equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature gradient. These changes contribute to increasing ENSO's amplitude by 17 %, mainly through strengthening the zonal wind forcing.  Concurrently, the El Niño-related warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies and the ensuing Pacific–East Asia teleconnection pattern (i.e. the ENSO–EAWM link) intensify, leading to an increased EAWM amplitude by 18 % in the coupled simulations. Therefore, in response to the increasing frequency of El Niño and La Niña years under Asian sulfate aerosol forcing, the interannual variability of the EAWM increases, with more extreme EAWM years. The opposite variations in the interannual variability of the EAWM to Asian aerosols in atmosphere-only simulations (−19 %) further reflect the importance of ENSO-related atmosphere–ocean coupled processes. A better understanding of the changes in the year-to-year variability of the EAWM in response to aerosol forcing is critical to reducing uncertainties in future projections of variability of regional extremes, such as cold surges and flooding, which can cause large social and economic impacts on densely populated East Asia."

Significant variations in BC and turbulent mixing occur mainly at night. Higher resolutions reduce BC overestimation due to enhanced mixing coefficients and vertical wind fluxes. Small-scale eddies at higher resolutions increase the BC lifetime and column concentrations. Land use and terrain variations across multiple resolutions affect turbulent mixing. 
 Air pollution in cities impacts public health and climate. Turbulent mixing is crucial in pollutant formation and dissipation, yet current atmospheric models struggle to accurately represent it. Turbulent mixing intensity varies with model resolution, which has rarely been analyzed. To investigate turbulent mixing variations at multiple resolutions and their implications for urban pollutant transport, we conducted experiments using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) at resolutions of 25, 5, and 1 km. The simulated meteorological fields and black carbon (BC) concentrations are compared with observations. Differences in turbulent mixing across multiple resolutions are more pronounced at night, resulting in noticeable variations in BC concentrations. BC surface concentrations decrease as resolution increases from 25 to 5 km and further to 1 km, but they are similar at 5 and 1 km resolutions. Enhanced planetary boundary layer (PBL) mixing coefficients and vertical wind flux at higher resolutions reduce BC surface concentration overestimations. The 1 km resolution parameterized lower mixing coefficients than 5 km but resolved more small-scale eddies, leading to similar near-surface turbulent mixing at both resolutions, while the intensity at higher altitudes was greater at 1 km. This caused BC to be transported higher and farther, increasing its atmospheric lifetime and column concentrations. Variations in mixing coefficients are partly attributed to differences in land use and terrain, with higher resolutions providing more detailed information that enhances PBL mixing coefficients, while grid size remains crucial in regions with more gradual terrain and land use changes. This study interprets how turbulent mixing affects simulated urban pollutant diffusion at multiple resolutions."

These increasing natural emissions, mainly due to climate warming, are weakening the benefits of reducing human-made emissions through control, leading to higher ozone levels. This work helps us understand how climate change influences air quality and provides important insights for improving pollution control strategies in the future. 
 Ozone (O3) concentrations in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) during summer are typically low and often overlooked. However, integrated observational data indicate a consistent increase in summer O3 levels over recent decades (+0.96 ppb yr−1), contradicting China's efforts to reduce anthropogenic emissions. Our dynamically calculated natural emissions show that biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions in the region significantly increased between 2001 and 2020, primarily due to climate change and alterations in vegetation cover, with climate-driven BVOC emissions accounting for approximately 80 % of the increase. Furthermore, parallel simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting–Community Multiscale Air Quality (WRF–CMAQ) model indicate that climate-driven BVOC emissions, by enhancing atmospheric oxidative capacity and accelerating O3 formation, have weakened or even offset the benefits of anthropogenic emission reductions, contributing 6.2 ppb to O3 formation and leading to an unexpected rise in O3 levels. This study enhances our understanding of the mechanisms behind natural emissions in urban O3 formation under climate change and provides insights for future O3 pollution control strategies."

This property is relevant to how the cloud interacts with sunlight and how easily the cloud forms precipitation. Measuring this property from satellite observations is one important source of data, but it does require making some assumptions. This study evaluates the accuracy of satellite-derived drop concentration by a comparison with aircraft measurements. 
 Cloud drop number concentration (Nd) can be retrieved through passive satellite observation. These retrievals are useful due to their wide spatial and temporal coverage. However, the accuracy of the retrieved values is not well understood. In this study, we seek to understand why the retrievals agree or disagree with in situ measurements by examining the various cloud properties that underlie the retrievals. To do so, we compare satellite Nd derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument with in situ aircraft measurements made using a phase Doppler interferometer on board three flight campaigns sampling marine stratocumulus clouds. Intercomparison of Nd values shows that the discrepancy between retrieved and in situ Nd can be ± 50 % or more. In the mean, there is evidence of an overestimation bias by MODIS retrievals, although the sample size is insufficient for statistical certainty. We find that MODIS Nd is best interpreted as representative of the mid-cloud region, as there is almost always a greater discrepancy from in situ values near the cloud top and cloud base. We also find evidence of cases where Nd is accurately retrieved but the effective radius is not, presumably due to offsetting errors in other retrieval parameters. Vertical profiles of the extinction coefficient β, liquid water content L, and effective radius re measured during sawtooth-pattern flight legs through the cloud top are also compared to implicit MODIS retrieval profiles. For the two cases with Nd agreement, all profiles match well. For the six cases with significant disagreement, there is no consistent underlying cause. The discrepancy originates from one of the following: (a) discrepancy in the re profile, (b) discrepancy in the β and L profiles, or (c) discrepancy in both."

Several modern instruments include AVHRR-heritage channels, but some corrections are necessary to account for some differences. We have simulated AVHRR data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIIRS) sensor on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) polar satellites. We find that methods based on machine learning are capable of performing these corrections. 
 The long series of multispectral measurements from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), which began in 1979, is now approaching its end, with the last remaining AVHRR sensor currently operating aboard EUMETSAT's Metop-C satellite. Several climate data records (CDRs) built on AVHRR data now face the end of their observational record. However, since many modern imagers contain AVHRR-heritage spectral channels, the potential for an extension of these AVHRR-based climate data records exists. This study investigates the possibility of simulating original National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-19 (NOAA-19) AVHRR channels from the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Platform (NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) radiances using collocated AVHRR–VIIRS datasets from 2012–2013. Spectral band adjustments (SBAs) were derived using linear regression and neural networks (NNs). The NN approach produced the best results, and separating daytime from night-time conditions when simulating AVHRR channel 3B at 3.7 µm was key. Furthermore, daytime radiance corrections in this channel must depend on actual surface and cloud reflectances to be realistic, which was achieved only through the NN approach.The cloud mask, cloud top height, and cloud phase products were produced from the simulated AVHRR radiances using the same retrieval methods for NOAA-19 data used to compile the CLARA-A3 CDR. CLARA-A3 is the third edition of the EUMETSAT Climate Monitoring Satellite Application Facility (CM SAF) CDR, with cloud parameters, surface albedo, surface radiation, and top of atmosphere (TOA) radiation products from AVHRR. Products were validated using Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations–Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIPSO–CALIOP) cloud products and agreed well with the original CLARA-A3 products, with the best results provided by the NN simulation approach. The NN-based approach best reproduced the corresponding products for cloud optical thickness (COT), cloud effective radius (CRE), liquid water path (LWP), and ice water path (IWP).The CLARA-A3 CDR will be complemented and extended with VIIRS-based products to cover the period 1979–2024 (46 years). This edition will be known as CLARA-A3.5. Future extensions and editions can follow a similar approach by applying the same radiance simulation method to collocated data from the Metop-C AVHRR and the Metop Second Generation (SG) METimage sensors, with the first satellite of the latter scheduled for launch in August 2025. The successful simulation of AVHRR radiances from METimage and VIIRS data enables the CLARA CDR extension for several decades."

As direct observations, spectral radiation fields are also largely free of uncertainties that accumulate during geophysical retrieval and data assimilation processes. Comparing these direct observations with Earth system models (ESMs), however, is hindered by definitional differences between the radiation fields satellites observe and those generated by models. Here, we present a flexible, computationally efficient tool called COSP-RTTOV (Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project (CFMIP) Observation Simulator Package and Radiative Transfer for TOVS) for simulating satellite-like radiation fields within ESMs. Outputs from COSP-RTTOV are consistent with instrument spectral response functions, orbit sampling, and the physics of the host model. After validating COSP-RTTOV's performance, we demonstrate new constraints on model performance enabled by COSP-RTTOV. We show additional applications in climate change detection using the NASA Atmospheric Infra-Red Sounder (AIRS) instrument and observing system simulation experiments using the NASA PREFIRE mission. In summary, COSP-RTTOV is a convenient tool for directly comparing satellite radiation observations with ESMs. It enables a wide range of scientific applications, especially when users desire to avoid the assumptions and uncertainties inherent in satellite-based retrievals of geophysical variables or in atmospheric reanalysis."

While extensive research has focused on ground-level HONO, the sources and atmospheric implications of high-altitude HONO remain poorly understood. In this study, the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model was employed to explore the vertical distribution of HONO chemistry. The revised model, incorporating five additional HONO sources, effectively reproduced observed HONO concentrations and enhanced the model’s performance in simulating ozone and secondary particulate matter. The analysis revealed that the predominant source of HONO near the surface was heterogeneous reactions of NO2 on the ground surface, with sinks mainly consisting of vertical diffusion, dry deposition and photolysis. In the upper air layer (90–600 m), the primary sources of HONO included the homogeneous reaction of NO with OH, the heterogeneous reaction of NO2 on the aerosol surface and vertical diffusion, while the main sinks were photolysis and horizontal advection. This study provides valuable insights into the vertical distribution characteristics of HONO chemistry and underscores its critical influence on tropospheric air quality."

In this study, we conducted parallel PM2.5 sampling in the TP (Lhasa and Nyingchi) and Beijing. Comparative analysis revealed that PM2.5 in the TP shows weaker light absorption but comparable inherent oxidative potential (OP) to urban Beijing, suggesting substantial aerosol toxicity in the pristine TP. This difference can be explained by considering the roles of organic carbon (OC) and metals. PM2.5 in the TP contains both a greater proportion of OC and a higher degree of aging in its OC fraction, which not only influences light absorption and OP but also magnifies the effect of OC aging on these properties. Notably, in Nyingchi, a relatively pristine high-altitude region, the higher OC content demonstrates stronger OC-correlated light absorption and OP than Lhasa, where transition metals additionally contribute to OP. These findings provide valuable parameters for understanding optical properties and health effects in high-altitude areas, advance the optical–toxicity coupling relationship, and redefine our understanding of air pollution risks in high-altitude environments."

While SUHII is characterized by a well pronounced diurnal cycle that peaks around noon, we observed changes in strength of SUHII that were correlated with changes in traffic speed. This leads to distinct weekend and rush hour effects on SUHII. Citywide, we observed a statistically significant correlation in which each 10 mph decrease in bus speed is associated with an increase of 0.36°C in SUHII. That effect is stronger in highly vegetated, low‐building areas, where traffic‐emitted waste heat is more dominant than other anthropogenic sources. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating congestion metrics into urban heat research, offering new insights for planners and policymakers seeking to mitigate local thermal extremes."

Satellite remote sensing enables global‐scale CO2 monitoring, providing column‐averaged dry air mole fractions of CO2 (XCO2). Current missions such as the Orbiting Carbon Observatory‐2 (OCO‐2) and Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) series provide high‐quality XCO2 but have many observation gaps because of narrow swath widths or cloud interference. To address this, we first propose a machine learning (ML) approach to estimate daily XCO2 (ML XCO2) at a 0.25° ${}^{\circ}$ resolution using OCO‐2, Sentinel‐5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument, and ERA5 reanalysis data from May 2018 to December 2023. Validation against the Total Carbon Column Observing Network measurements shows high agreement, with an R2 of 0.95, a root mean square error of 1.05 ppm, and a mean absolute error of 0.78 ppm. The spatiotemporal variations in ML XCO2 are generally consistent with OCO‐2, GOSAT, and the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS) XCO2. Notably, during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic in 2020, ML XCO2 estimates were more consistent with OCO‐2 and GOSAT XCO2 than CAMS XCO2, which was overestimated owing to unadjusted COVID‐19‐related CO2 emission reductions. The annual mean CO2 growth rates from ML XCO2 (2.065–2.735 ppm/year, 2019–2023) also agree with estimates from OCO‐2 and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration surface measurements, indicating the robustness of our approach. Our study demonstrates that the synergy between multiple‐satellite measurements enhances the spatial coverage of XCO2 and improves our understanding of the global carbon cycle."

It hosts ground and aircraft observations critical for monitoring greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the region that are yet to be fully utilized. To analyze these observations, we developed a high‐resolution CO2 model at smallest grid size of 1 × 1 km2 using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with GHGs fluxes (WRF‐GHG). The model used three different anthropogenic emission inventories: EAGrid (Japan region, 1 × 1 km2), EDGAR (0.1° × 0.1°), and EDGAR‐downscaled (0.01° × 0.1°) and was run for February and May 2018 and February 2020. At 1 × 1 km2 resolution, simulations resolve point‐source emission, which gradually attenuate as the model resolution is coarsened to 3 × 3, 9 × 9 or 27 × 27 km2; however, at surface sites, the 1 × 1 km2 model introduces transport errors weakening the correlation with observations compared to the 27 × 27 km2 model. CO2 simulations are found to be sensitive to planetary boundary layer dynamics on event basis. The 1 × 1 km2 model better reproduced the CO2 aircraft observations between 0 and 3 km compared to 27 × 27 km2 model, suggesting critical roles of improved representation of emission patterns and transport processes. We demonstrate that a systematic bias is introduced in the CO2 vertical distribution in the mid‐upper troposphere (altitude >3 km) when lateral and top boundary conditions are neglected in WRF‐GHG. These systematic biases in vertical distribution can have profound impact when comparing with remote sensing observations of total columns."

Quantitative understanding of how structural and surface properties determine photophoretic lofting forces is necessary to develop a practical flying device. Here we focus on thermal transpiration as the most promising photophoretic mechanism for lofting large devices8 and present a hybrid analytical–numerical model of the lofting force on a structure that consists of two perforated membranes spaced a small distance apart. We identify optimal structural parameters, including device size, membrane perforation density and distribution of the vertical ligaments that connect the two membranes, each as a function of atmospheric altitude. Targeting these optimal parameters, we fabricate structures with a heterogeneous ligament distribution, which efficiently compromises between structural rigidity and photophoretic performance. We measure how lofting forces generated by these structures depend on pressure using gases with three different molecular weights. We observed photophoretic levitation of a 1-cm-wide structure at an air pressure of 26.7 Pa when illuminated by 750 W m−2, about 55% the intensity of sunlight. Lastly, we describe the preliminary design of a 3-cm-radius device with 10-mg payload capacity at 75-km altitudes and discuss horizontal motion control, overnight settling, and applications in climate sensing, communications and Martian exploration.

 Fine aerosols (FA, radius <1 µm) may enhance cloud albedo for a given liquid water path (LWP), thereby partially offsetting greenhouse gas-induced warming. However, the aerosol-driven LWP adjustment is currently heavily debated due to conflicting observations. Here, we observationally found that both FA and coarse sea spray aerosols (CSA, radius > 1 µm) exhibit bidirectional regulation on LWP adjustments through precipitation-evaporation competition. In marine stratocumulus with moderate thickness, under dry cloud-top environments (RH < 20%) where evaporation dominates, FA decreases LWP by ~15% while CSA induces a slight ~8% increase. Conversely, in humid cloud-top environments (RH > 80%) favoring precipitation processes, the addition of FA more than doubles LWP, whereas the addition of CSA nearly halves it. Thin cloud LWP changes are primarily driven by droplet evaporation, while deep cloud LWP changes are dominated by precipitation. Our findings underscore the necessity to resolve precipitation-evaporation dynamics and opposing FA and CSA effects for credible aerosol-cloud interaction simulations."

 Previous studies have discovered that an increase in aerosol concentration could affect the development of precipitation and tropical cyclones. However, with increasing efforts to mitigate climate change, the amount of anthropogenic aerosols in the atmosphere is expected to decrease in the future. This study aims at understanding how such a reduction in aerosol number concentration could affect the precipitation pattern of tropical cyclones through case studies of Typhoon Haikui and Koinu. The Thompson aerosol-aware microphysics scheme in the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model is used, and the water-friendly aerosol number concentration is reduced by a factor of 100. For both tropical cyclones, a reduction in aerosol results in consistent expansion of precipitation area due to the enhanced warm rain process. However, the total precipitation of Koinu decreases while that of Haikui increases, depending on whether warm-rain or ice-phase processes dominate and whether upper-level convection is altered."

 Interactions between aerosols and the planetary boundary layer (PBL) play a crucial role in aggravating air quality and modulating regional climate. Despite intensive studies exploring the aerosol-PBL interaction predominantly focused on short-term haze events, uncertainties remain in understanding this interaction over longer timescales. To fill this gap, we investigate the long-term trends of extremely high and low PBL height (PBLH) across China, utilizing multi-observed datasets and sensitivity experiments conducted with the Community Atmosphere Model version 6 (CAM6) with full chemistry. Here the extremely high (low) PBLH is defined as mean values of the daily PBLH higher (lower) than 90th (10th) percentile for each season. Our analysis reveals a significant increase in extremely high PBLH during the period 1979–2003 (seasonal ranging from +283.36 to +326.80 m/decade), followed by a pronounced reversal to declining trends during 2004–2016 (−321.45 to −178.83 m/decade). The trend shift is primarily driven by variations in surface sensible heat fluxes. Conversely, extremely low PBLH exhibits an obvious “negative to positive” trend shift around 2007 during 2000–2016, especially over Eastern and Central China (ECC) with a mean trend magnitude of +153.2 m/decade after 2007. The long-term trend of extremely low PBLH is dominated by changes in shortwave atmosphere absorption, which are influenced by the direct radiative effect of black carbon (BC) aerosols. Comparative simulations with BC's direct radiative effect turning on/off further demonstrate the reduced BC aerosols after 2007 diminishes the shortwave atmosphere absorption and enhances the surface shortwave radiation, thereby promoting an increase in extremely low PBLH, and vice versa. These findings highlight the distinct mechanisms influencing the long-term trend of extremely high and low PBLH over China, and provide new insights into the long-term variability of PBLH and its relationship with aerosols."

Updated simulations reveal insignificant trends but greater variability in lightning NOx emissions, impacting tropospheric NOx, O3, and OH. Lightning generally counteracts non-lightning factors, reducing the inter-annual variability of tropospheric O3 and OH. Variations in global lightning play an important role in understanding the atmospheric methane budget. 
 Lightning is a significant source of nitrogen oxides (NOx≡NO+NO2) in the free troposphere. Variations in global lightning activity influence long-term trends (LTTs) and inter-annual variability (IAV) in tropospheric NOx, ozone (O3), and hydroxyl radicals (OH). However, accurately quantifying these impacts is hindered by uncertainties in representing year-to-year fluctuations in global lightning activity in models. Here, we apply Schumann resonance (SR) observations, which are sensitive to changes in global lightning activity, to better constrain inter-annual variations in lightning NOx (LNOx) emissions. By integrating this update into an atmospheric chemical transport model, we assess the contributions of lightning to both LTT and IAV in global atmospheric chemistry from 2013–2021. The updated parameterisation predicts an insignificant trend in global LNOx emissions, contrasting with a significant increase of 6.4 % dec−1 (P<0.05) by the original parameterisation, reducing lightning contributions to LTTs in NOx, O3, and OH. The updated simulation better aligns with satellite-observed trends in global and northern hemispheric NO2 but further underestimates tropospheric O3 increases. The updated parameterisation reveals twice the IAV in global LNOx emissions but 20 % smaller IAVs in global O3 and OH because lightning generally counteracts other sources of natural variability. A ∼10 % decline in lightning in 2020 relative to 2019 led to a ∼2 % decrease in global OH, explaining half of observed annual methane growth.  These findings highlight the value of Schumann resonance observations in constraining global lightning activity, thereby enhancing our understanding of lightning's role in atmospheric chemistry."

We show that the proposed methods enable the detection of smaller plumes (compared with those detectable using other existing methods) and improve the potential of MethaneAIR to survey methane point sources across large regions. 
 The MethaneAIR imaging spectrometer was originally developed as an airborne demonstrator of the MethaneSAT satellite mission. MethaneAIR  enables accurate methane concentration retrievals from high-spectral-resolution measurements in the 1650 nm methane absorption feature at a nominal spatial sampling of 5 × 25 m. In this work, we present a computationally efficient data processing chain optimized for the detection and quantification of methane plumes with MethaneAIR. It involves the retrieval of methane concentration enhancements (ΔXCH4) with the high-precision matched-filter retrieval, which is applied to 1650 nm retrievals for the first time. Methane plumes are detected via visual inspection of the resulting ΔXCH4 maps. We evaluated the performance of this processing scheme with simulated plumes, intercomparison with other methods, and controlled methane releases. We applied this processing chain to MethaneAIR data mosaics acquired over the Permian Basin during flights in 2021 and 2023, which resulted in the detection of hundreds of point sources above 100–200 kg h−1, with a conservative detection limit of around 120 kg h−1.

 The Joint Aeolus Tropical Atlantic Campaign (JATAC) conducted in 2022 in Cabo Verde has provided quantitative lidar measurements, particularly from the NASA Langley High-Altitude Lidar Observatory (HALO) on board DC-8 aircraft, for process-level understanding of tropical dynamics, as well as for satellite validation. For the first time, the optical properties of particles (i.e. backscatter, extinction, attenuated backscatter coefficients, and depolarization ratios) have been measured for extended tropospheric sections collocated with the Aeolus satellite overpasses with limited geolocation and time offsets. This has contributed to the evaluation of the Aeolus Level-2A (L2A) aerosol optical properties product. In addition, localized aerosol profiles were measured by the ground-based multiwavelength Raman polarization and water vapour lidar PollyXT.In this study, we assess the quality of the Aeolus L2A product retrieved with the standard correct algorithm (SCA) and the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) as part of the September 2022 dataset reprocessed with the L2A processor, version 16. The focus is given to the 355 nm aerosol retrievals given at finer horizontal resolution, i.e. the so-called Aeolus measurement level at ≈ 18 km. They are compared to the 532 nm HALO airborne profiles that are converted to 355 nm using the backscatter Ångström exponent. HALO and PollyXT polarization lidars also provide insights into the L2A algorithm's limitations when looking at non-spherical particles such as Saharan dust. Even though it has no cross-polarized component, the Aeolus measurements can be corrected using collocated observations with such instruments that include both co-polarized and cross-polarized components of the backscattered light. Moreover the cross-validation with independent lidar measurements enables estimation of the lower limits for Aeolus backscatter detection."
10.1029/2025JD044021,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文主要关注通过将高级粒子微物理模型（APM）集成到CMAQ模型中，来改进美国地区粒子数量浓度的模拟。该研究旨在更准确地表示气溶胶的粒径分布，这对于评估粒子对气候、云和公众健康的影响至关重要。论文讨论了APM模型如何改进CMAQ对气溶胶粒径分布的模拟能力，特别是对超细粒子和云凝结核（CCN）活化阈值的模拟，从而为量化气溶胶-气候相互作用和暴露风险提供了一个强大的工具。虽然论文没有直接提及卫星观测或特定遥感技术，但它对大气成分（特别是气溶胶）的模拟改进，可以为使用遥感数据进行空气质量监测和大气成分分析提供更可靠的基础。,"['air quality monitoring', 'aerosol size distribution', 'particle number concentration', 'cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)', 'ultrafine particles', 'aerosol-climate interactions']",Jingbo Mao;Fangqun Yu;Benjamin N.

Gannet Hallar,Improved Simulation of Particle Number Concentrations Over the US: Integrating a Size‐Resolved Advanced Particle Microphysics Model Into CMAQ,"Accurate representation of aerosol size distributions and total number concentrations is critical for evaluating particle impacts on climate, clouds, and public health. An Advanced Particle Microphysics model (APM) has been integrated into the USEPA's Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling System (CMAQ) to improve its representation of aerosol size distribution. CMAQ is a state‐of‐the‐science air quality model simulating the emission, transport, formation, evolution, and deposition of air pollutants. Unlike the original CMAQ's simplified modal approach, the sectional APM model distinguishes primary and secondary particles, keeps track of secondary species coated on each type of primary particle (black carbon, primary organic carbon, dust, and sea salt), and uses flexible binning for different particle types. This introduces 116 new APM‐related tracers increasing computational cost by 83% but enabling high‐size resolution aerosol simulations. The updated CMAQ‐APM incorporates a ternary H2SO4‐H2O‐NH3 ion‐mediated nucleation scheme to investigate particle formation and growth over the United States. Predicted monthly mean nucleation rates, particles larger than 10 nm (CN10), and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) at 0.4% supersaturation (CCN0.4) in the surface in summer and winter of 2013 range from ∼0.001 to ∼2 cm−3 s−1, ∼2,000–15,000 cm−3, and ∼300–5,000 cm−3, respectively. Modeled CN10 and CCN0.4 generally align well with observations with normalized mean bias in the range of −6.42%–192.32% and 11.44%–36.06%, respectively. The incorporation of APM into CMAQ substantially improves the capability of CMAQ in representing size‐resolved particles, especially ultrafine particles and CCN activation thresholds, hence offering a robust tool for quantifying aerosol‐climate interactions and exposure risks."

 Variations in cloud condensation nuclei number concentration (NCCN) significantly influence cloud microphysics, yet direct NCCN measurements remain challenging. Here, we present an NCCN ensemble learning (NEL) model utilizing ensemble learning and interpretability analysis on aerosol optical parameters. Validated at two land sites, two ocean sites and one polar site within the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program, the mean absolute percentage error range of the NEL model across different environments is from 12% to 36%, demonstrating high accuracy. Key findings reveal that aerosol optical parameters can serve as predictors for NCCN. Aerosol scattering and backscattering coefficients, absorption coefficient, backscatter fraction (BSF), and Ångström exponent (AE) are positively correlated with NCCN, while single scattering albedo shows negative correlations. NCCN prediction at land sites is highly sensitive to BSF, largely driven by the backscattering coefficient, as fine particles dominate in these sites. At ocean sites, NCCN prediction is more sensitive to AE, primarily influenced by the scattering coefficient, due to the higher proportion of larger particles. At the polar site, NCCN prediction shows sensitivity to both BSF and AE, mainly driven by the scattering coefficient, as polar sites are cleaner and contain larger particles. These differences reflect the variation in particle size and number concentration across different environments."

10.1088/1748-9326/adf23c,True,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注全球变暖背景下，日变化云循环（DCC）的变化及其对气候的影响。通过分析13年的卫星观测数据，发现DCC具有增温效应。低云的重心位置从白天向夜晚移动，增强了夜间的增温效应，减少了太阳辐射的反射；而高云则表现出相反的趋势。研究表明，随着全球平均气温升高，DCCRE预计将继续增强气候变暖。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它依赖于卫星观测来研究云的特性和辐射效应，从而理解气候变化。,"['satellite observations', 'cloud radiative effects', 'diurnal cloud cycle', 'climate warming', 'low clouds', 'high clouds']",Tingting Chen;Jinming Ge;Chi Zhang;Yanyan Wu;Qingyu Mu;Xinyi Han;Jing Su;Xiaoyu Hu;Zeen Zhu,Shifts in diurnal cycles of low and high clouds warm the climate: evidence from decadal satellite observations,"Anticipated changes in the diurnal cloud cycle (DCC) under global warming carry significant implications for future climate predictions. However, there is a notable dearth of studies specifically focusing on DCC shifts. Here, we establish a connection between DCC and its radiative effects (DCCRE), revealing that the DCC has tended to warm the climate over the past 13 years. We found that the centroid position determines the warming or cooling effect of DCCRE, while the magnitude of the amplitude influences its strength. As global mean temperature (GMT) rises, low cloud centroid tends to shift from daytime to nighttime, enhancing nighttime warming effects and diminishing solar radiation reflection. Conversely, high clouds exhibit the opposite, reducing nighttime warming effects and displaying stronger DCCRE compared to low clouds. For each 1 °C increase in GMT, the total cloud DCCRE is expected to rise by 2.90 W m−2, mainly driven by low clouds contributing to an increase of 1.85 W m−2. This suggests that DCCRE may continue to warm the climate as GMT rises. These results indicate that the changes in DCC are significant for understanding climate variability. However, it should be noted that these findings are based on short-term regression analysis and further research is needed to determine whether they are related to long-term responses."

However, the characteristics and causes of lightning activity across high latitudes such as the pan-Arctic region are still unclear. Here we explore spatiotemporal variations and climatic drivers of lightning stroke density (LSD) across the pan-Arctic (45° N –90° N) during 2010–2024, based on the latest global lightning datasets. Results show that LSD was up to 9.29 strokes 100 km−2 yr−1 over pan-Arctic regions during 2010–2024, with positive trends of 0.556 strokes 100 km−2 year−1 for land grids. Regionally, LSD shows significant positive linear trends in North America (NAM), central Europe (CEU) and western Russia (WRU), with highs up to 2.159 strokes 100 km−2 yr−1, 3.612 strokes 100 km−2 yr−1 and 2.071 strokes 100 km−2 yr−1, respectively. However, LSD decreases significantly by −2.042 strokes 100 km−2 yr−1 in northern China (NCH). The possible climatic causes of LSD trends are examined across the four regions through multiple linear regression and random forest models. Increasing sea surface temperature dominates positive LSD trends up to 1.125 strokes 100 km−2 yr−1 and 2.119 strokes 100 km−2 yr−1 over NAM and CEU, accounting for 52% and 59% of the observed trends. Increased surface air temperature and reduced aerosols jointly control the increasing LSD trend over WRU, up to 1.280 strokes 100 km−2 yr−1 and 1.112 strokes 100 km−2 yr−1, respectively. The negative LSD trend in NCH are mainly related to increases in local wind shear, resulting in a decline of −0.934 strokes 100 km−2yr−1 in LSD trends. Moreover, the use of random forest models as cross-validation also revealed similar climatic causes over these regions. Our findings highlight increasing trends in lightning activity over high-latitude regions in recent decades, suggesting the need to fully consider the impacts of climate change on future lightning activities under various emission scenarios."

In general, the seasonal trends in both concentrations and isotopic composition of NO3− are weaker at GWS than at ZS. The seasonal variations in δ15N‐NO3− at both sites suggest shifts in the main sources of NO3−. During the light period (October–April), δ15N‐NO3− is significantly lower at ZS than at GWS, indicating a primary origin of NO3− from snow nitrogen oxides emissions driven by NO3− photolysis. In contrast, midlatitude tropospheric transport and oceanic emissions of alkyl nitrates may play a prominent role at GWS. In the dark period (May–September), stratospheric inputs persist for a shorter time at GWS than at ZS, resulting in lower δ15N‐NO3− at GWS. Oxygen isotopes (δ18O and Δ17O) in precipitation NO3− are also higher during the dark period than during the light period at both sites. In the light period, NO3− production is mainly influenced by hydroxyl radicals and peroxyl radicals at GWS, resulting in lower δ18O‐ and Δ17O‐NO3− values than at ZS, where ozone (O3) plays a more important role in NO3− formation. In the dark period, significantly higher oxygen isotopic values of NO3− at ZS than at GWS suggest the more important role of O3, especially stratospheric O3, on NO3− production at ZS. The findings of this study suggest the distinct sources and formation chemistry of atmospheric NO3− in different Antarctic climates."

 Aerosols, through their direct, semi-direct, and indirect interactions with radiation, play a crucial role in Earth's climate. This study focuses on elevated aerosol layers (EALs) in the free troposphere over Eastern India. Using a decade (2013–2023) of spaceborne lidar measurements of aerosol-type-specific extinction coefficient profiles, we examine the occurrence, vertical distribution, extent, and spatial and seasonal variations of various EAL types. Our findings reveal the persistent presence of EALs, primarily consisting of dust and continental aerosols, throughout the year. These layers show their highest occurrence—exceeding by an order of magnitude—during the pre-monsoon season. EAL heights exhibit limited seasonal variation, with the highest elevations observed during the monsoon season (3.6–4.1 km), followed by the pre-monsoon (3.3–4.0 km), winter seasons (3.3–3.6 km) and post-monsoon (3.2–3.5 km). Substantial spatial variations in EAL characteristics are apparent across the study domain in all seasons, likely due to region-specific sources of EALs, as supported by Lagrangian back-trajectory analysis. By analyzing meteorological datasets, we demonstrate that days with EAL observations are associated with negative anomalies in lower-tropospheric stability and precipitation, and positive anomalies in outgoing longwave radiation (indicative of shallow or no convection), compared to days without EALs. These findings suggest a significant role for atmospheric stability and precipitation in controlling EAL variations. This study highlights the potential of height-resolved lidar measurements for accurately quantifying the type, occurrence, and vertical extent of EALs."

 Existing findings regarding the impacts of aerosol concentrations on fog are inconsistent and have primarily focused on the influence of low aerosol levels. In this study, the effects of high aerosol levels on fog were investigated using the WRF-Chem model to assess the extent to which aerosol levels affect fog in the North China Plain (NCP). The results showed that liquid water content (LWC), fog duration, and fog-top heights all increased nonlinearly with increasing aerosol concentrations, exhibiting a high growth rate when PM2.5 concentration was below 200 μg m−3, and gradually leveling off thereafter. However, when PM2.5 concentration exceeded 427 μg m−3, LWC, fog duration, and fog-top height all rapidly decreased with increasing aerosol concentrations, due to suppressing effect induced by aerosol-radiation interaction (ARI) overweighed promoting effect of aerosol-cloud interaction (ACI) on fog. Meanwhile, excessive cloud condensation nuclei suppressed fog through the intense competitions for vapor and the evaporation of smaller droplets. The results suggested that a PM2.5 concentration in the range of 395–427 μg m−3 is the critical threshold that suppressed fog in the NCP, and current pollution levels remain below this threshold. In addition, we analyzed the individual effects of ARI, ACI, black carbon (BC) and non-BC aerosols on fog under current pollution level. The results suggested that ARI effect played a dominant role during the fog–haze episode, while the effect of ACI on fog was negligible. Furthermore, the results showed that BC played a leading role in fog formation."

It analyses key regional events in Southern California, Northeast Amazonia, Pantanal-Chiquitano, and the Congo Basin, assessing their drivers, predictability, and attributing them to climate change and land use. Seasonal outlooks and decadal projections are provided. Climate change greatly increased the likelihood of these fires, and without strong mitigation, such events will become more frequent. 
 Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme wildfires globally, yet our understanding of these high-impact events remains uneven and shaped by media attention and regional research biases. The State of Wildfire Project systematically tracks and analyses global fire activity and this, its second annual report, covers the March 2024 to February 2025 fire season. During the 2024–25 fire season, fire-related carbon (C) emissions were totalled 2.2 Pg C, 9 % above average and the 6th highest on record since 2003, despite below-average global burned area (BA; 3.7 million km2). Extreme fire seasons in South America’s rainforests, dry forests and wetlands, and in Canada’s boreal forests pushed up the global C emissions total. Fire C emissions were over four times above average in Bolivia, three times above average in Canada, and ~50 % above average in Brazil and Venezuela. Wildfires in 2024–25 caused 100 fatalities in Nepal, 34 in South Africa, and 30 in Los Angeles, with additional fatalities reported in Canada, Côte d’Ivoire, Portugal, and Turkey. The Eaton and Palisades fires in Southern California caused 150,000 evacuations and US$140 billion in damages. Communities in Brazil, Bolivia, Southern California, and Northern India were exposed to fine particulate matter at concentrations 13–60 times WHO’s daily air quality standards. We evaluated the causes and predictability of four extreme wildfire episodes from the 2024–25 fire season, including in Northeast Amazonia (January–March 2024), the Pantanal-Chiquitano border regions of Brazil and Bolivia (July–September 2024), Southern California (January 2025), and the Congo Basin (July–August 2024). Anomalous weather created conditions for these regional extremes, while fuel availability and human ignitions shaped spatial patterns and temporal fire dynamics. In the three tropical regions, prolonged drought was the dominant fire enabler, whereas in California, extreme heat, wind, and antecedent fuel build-up were the dominant enablers. Our attribution analyses show that climate change made extreme fire weather in Northeast Amazonia 30–70 times more likely, increasing burned area roughly fourfold compared to a scenario without climate change. In the Pantanal–Chiquitano, fire weather was 4–5 times more likely, with up to 35-fold increases in burned area. In Southern California, climate change made larger burned area 89 % more likely, with burned area up to 25 times higher. The Congo Basin’s fire weather was 3–8 times more likely with climate change, with a 2.7-fold increase in burned area. Socioeconomic changes since the pre-industrial period, including land-use change, also likely increased burned area in Northeast Amazonia. Our models project that events on the scale of 2024–25 will become up to 57 %, 34 %, and 50 % more frequent than in the modern era in Northeast Amazonia, the Pantanal-Chiquitano, and the Congo Basin, respectively, under a middle-of-the-road scenario (SSP370). Climate action can limit the added risk, with frequency increases kept below 15 % in all three regions under a strong mitigation scenario (SSP126). In Southern California, the future trajectory of extreme fire likelihood remains highly uncertain due to poorly constrained climate-vegetation-fire interactions influencing fuel moisture, though our models suggest that risk may decline in future. This annual report from the State of Wildfires Project integrates and advances cutting-edge fire observations and modelling with regional expertise to track changing global wildfire hazard, guiding policy and practice towards improved preparedness, mitigation, adaptation, and societal benefit. Thirteen new datasets and model codebases presented in this work are available from the State of Wildfires Project’s Zenodo community (https://zenodo.org/communities/stateofwildfiresproject, last access: 11 August 2025)."

 Solar radiation can be a potential source of cost-effective and sustainable energy, offering the promise of a clean and safe environment in the East African region. However, reliable solar radiation data remain limited, hindering accurate assessment of the available solar potential and characterisation of the local and regional climate. To address this issue, this study used in situ measurements from 11 ground-based meteorological stations to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the satellite-derived solar radiation product, SARAH-3, across Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Rwanda. Statistical distribution, degree of linear association, explanatory strength, infra-daily, daily, and seasonal cycles were used to assess the degree of similarity. Our findings revealed a significant agreement between surface reference data and SARAH-3 Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) data and a significant linear association between bias and the Orographic Complexity Index (OCI) of the neighbour area of the observation points with Pearson’s correlation coefficients (R) of −0.53. At half-hour resolution, in situ measurements and satellite-based solar radiation data revealed high R values, ranging from 0.70 to 0.92, with significant explanatory capacity between 54% and 86%. Percentage bias (PB) was markedly lower than 5% for most stations, except in Rwanda, where PB reached 25%. The distributions of the data sets were generally skewed in the same direction, with a slight difference. Linear association and explanatory capacity improved significantly on the daily time scale, with R exceeding 0.90 and coefficients of determination greater than 78% at all stations. Furthermore, PB and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were generally low on the monthly scale, except in Rwanda, particularly in Mukarange, where they reached 24.61% and 42.92, respectively. SARAH-3 successfully reproduces infra-daily, daily, and cycles, although its spatial performance is strongly influenced by terrain complexity. These findings confirm the potential of SARAH-3 for solar energy production and climate-related studies in the East African region."

Ghude,"Wintertime Intercomparison of Specific Humidity and Temperature Profiles Measured by Microwave Radiometer (MWR), Radiosonde, and INSAT‐3DR Sounder Over Delhi, India","Accurate profiling of atmospheric temperature and humidity is critical for weather forecasting, climate studies, and air quality management. This study evaluates wintertime atmospheric profiles of temperature and specific humidity (SH) from three systems over New Delhi, India: radiosondes, a ground‐based microwave radiometer (MWR), and the INSAT‐3DR satellite sounder. Radiosondes serve as the reference standard, offering high vertical resolution but limited temporal coverage. The MWR provides continuous high‐temporal‐resolution observations with good performance in the lower troposphere, while INSAT‐3DR delivers broad spatial coverage and hourly retrievals but with coarser vertical resolution near the surface and reduced accuracy under cloudy conditions. The comparison reveals that MWR profiles agree well with radiosonde observations below 4 km, with root mean square error values of <4 K for temperature and <2.2 g/kg for SH. However, MWR retrievals exhibit near‐surface cold and dry biases of up to −5 K and −1.2 g/kg (∼−25%), respectively. INSAT‐3DR shows good agreement for temperature throughout the levels (bias of <2%). In the 4–10 km altitude range, SH biases are within ∼25%, but show warm and moist biases near the surface exceeding 2 K and 1 g/kg (30%). These results confirm the complementary nature of MWR and INSAT‐3DR: MWR performs best in the boundary layer, while INSAT‐3DR is more reliable in the mid to top troposphere. The study underscores the importance of combining multiple observation platforms to enhance the accuracy of atmospheric profiling for improved numerical weather prediction and environmental modeling."

 The global proliferation of synthetic chemicals has led to the widespread and continuous release of Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs) into the environment. CECs include pharmaceuticals, pesticides, personal care products and other industrial chemicals that pose a significant risk to both ecosystems and human health. Regulatory frameworks have predominantly targeted aquatic systems; however, mounting evidence reveals the capacity of many CECs to volatilise, aerosolise and undergo atmospheric transport. This perspective highlights the overlooked atmospheric dimension of CECs and analyses the key physicochemical parameters governing their transfer to the atmospheric domain. The results indicate that many CECs can mobilise from water or soil and undergo atmospheric transport in both the gas- and particle-phase, crossing between several environmental continua as a result. While intrinsic properties such as vapour pressure and partitioning coefficients are central to this analysis, environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, solar radiation, and transformation reactions further modulate the environmental fate and impact of CECs. We emphasise the need for environmental monitoring and regulatory frameworks to incorporate air as a critical vector for CEC dispersion and exposure. Key research priorities identified measurements of CECs in the atmosphere, further development of predictive models, and toxicity evaluation of airborne CECs to better inform policy for protecting public and environmental health."

Kotarba;Agnieszka Wypych,Evaluation of the operational MODIS cloud mask product for detecting cirrus clouds,"Clouds affect Earth's energy balance, with high-altitude cirrus clouds contributing to atmospheric warming. While active satellite sensors are the most accurate for detecting cirrus clouds, they are not ideal for long-term studies. This study compares Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) data, testing six MODIS methods, one MODIS-based test, and two International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) tests. The all tests consolidation (ATC) was the most effective, achieving 72.98 % accuracy during daytime and 59.50 % at night, making it relatively accurate for creating a cirrus mask. 
 All clouds influence the Earth's radiative budget, with their net radiative forcing being negative. However, high-level clouds warrant special attention due to their atmospheric warming effects. A comprehensive characterization of cirrus clouds requires information on their coverage, which can be obtained from various data types. Active satellite sensors (lidars) are presently the most accurate source for cirrus data, but their usefulness in climatological studies is limited (the narrow view and 16 d repeat cycle yield only ∼20 observations per year per region, often insufficient for climatological studies). On the contrary, passive data, which have been available for the past 40 years with sufficient temporal resolution for climatological research, are less effective at detecting cirrus clouds compared to active vertical profiling sensors. In this study, we assessed the utility of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) standard products for creating a cirrus mask by validating them against Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization  (CALIOP) data. Our objective was to determine how well the operational cloud mask from the MODIS Science Team can be used to infer the presence of cirrus clouds relative to data products derived from the highly sensitive CALIOP instrument by the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) Science Team.Using CALIOP data as the reference, we evaluated six tests for cirrus and high cloud detection considered in the MODIS cloud masking algorithm and their combination (all tests consolidation, ATC). Additionally, we applied classifications based on the cirrus definition from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP), which rely on retrieved MODIS cloud-top properties. These were used not as detection tests but as a classification scheme for comparative purposes. All other tests were applied directly to MODIS radiances.The study revealed that ATC was the most effective, resulting in an overall accuracy of 72.98 % (probability of detection 80.9 %, false alarm rate 34.9 %, Cohen's κ 0.46) during the daytime and 59.50 % at night (probability of detection 25.5 %, false alarm rate 6.9 %, Cohen's κ 0.19). However, its effectiveness was notably reduced during the nighttime compared to during the daytime. We conclude that the MODIS operational Cloud Mask after being modified into ATC is moderately suitable for creating a mask of high-level clouds and only during the daytime. During the nighttime, MODIS ATC fails to reliably report the presence of cirrus."

As nitrogen dioxide (NO2) observations can enhance CO2 emission estimates, we use NO2 observations from twin polar‐orbiting satellites (GaoFen‐5B and DaQi‐1) to constrain carbon emission estimates based on the OCO‐3 XCO2 measurements. Compared previous CO2 estimation constrained by polar‐orbiting satellites (e.g., Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument), this approach detects 40% more daily emission cases and reduces uncertainties by up to 12%, primarily due to reduced temporal differences and increased observation frequency. The improved estimates cover 69 global emission cases, mainly in East Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and North America. About 45% of the estimated emissions are lower than bottom‐up inventory values, potentially reflecting the impact of local emission control efforts. These findings highlight the importance of satellite monitoring for FFCO2 emissions and the value of future missions with high‐resolution collocated NO2/CO2 measurements."

Linking satellite retrievals with socioeconomic or health data involves matching the irregularly shaped satellite observations with administrative units. Here, we develop a physics‐based approach to spatially oversample nitrogen dioxide (NO2) retrievals from TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) directly to United States (US) neighborhoods (i.e., block groups). The physics‐based oversampling approach considers each satellite pixel as a sensitivity distribution, meaning that satellite instruments are more sensitive to the neighborhoods at the center than at the edge of the observations. We show that directly oversampling satellite observations to administrative shapes is a more accurate and computationally efficient approach than the commonly used gridding approaches, and it is advantageous for shorter temporal windows. Combining the newly developed NO2 data set with demographic data, we find widespread racial/ethnic and income‐related NO2 disparities across the US. NO2 disparities are even more pronounced during the most polluted days, suggesting greater acute health effects for overburdened communities. We expect that the resolution‐adaptive, neighborhood‐level, and GIS‐compatible NO2 data set would lower barriers of the public to access and interpret satellite observations, facilitating the actionable applications of satellite observations."

 Aerosol–cloud interaction (ACI) significantly influences global and regional weather and is a critical focus in numerical weather prediction (NWP), but subgrid-scale ACI effects are often overlooked. Here, a subgrid-scale ACI mechanism is implemented by explicitly treating cloud microphysics in the KFeta convective scheme with real-time size-resolved hygroscopic aerosol activation and introducing subgrid-scale cloud radiation feedback in an atmospheric chemistry model, CMA_Meso5.1/CUACE. With a focus on summer over central and eastern China, the performance evaluation shows that this developed model with subgrid-scale cloud microphysics and radiation feedback refines cloud representation, even in some grid-scale unsaturated areas, and subsequently leads to attenuated surface downward shortwave radiation (∼ 18.5 W m−2) that is more realistic. The increased cloud radiative forcing results in lower temperature (∼ 0.35 °C) and higher relative humidity (∼ 2.5 %) at 2 m, with regional mean bias (MB) decreasing by ∼ 40 % and ∼ 18.1 %. Temperature vertical structure and relative humidity below ∼ 900 hPa are improved accordingly due to cooling and humidifying. The underestimated precipitation is enhanced, especially at the grid scale, thus reducing regional MB by ∼ 34.4 % (∼ 1.1 mm). The performance differences between various subregions are related to convective conditions and model local errors. Additionally, compared to simulations with anthropogenic emissions turned off, subgrid-scale actual aerosol inhibits cumulative precipitation during a typical heavy rainfall event by ∼ 4.6 mm, aligning it with observations, associated with lower autoconversion at the subgrid scale and less available water vapor for grid-scale condensation, suggesting competition between subgrid- and grid-scale cloud. This study contributes to the understanding of the impact of subgrid-scale ACI on NWP."

This study provides a first quantitative source analysis of ON aerosol and valuable observational evidence of secondary ON aerosol formation through NH3 and NOx chemistries. 
 Nitrogenous organic aerosol (OA) has a significant effect on solar radiation, human health, and ecosystems. However, our knowledge of the total budget of aerosol organic nitrogen (ON) and its major sources, particularly the secondary formation processes, remains largely qualitative. In this study, we conducted bihourly measurements of aerosol ON and a comprehensive array of organic and inorganic source markers in urban Shanghai during the fall–winter period of 2021. ON accounted for 6 %–58 % of the total aerosol N, averaging 20 %. Positive factorization matrix source apportionment revealed that both primary emissions (52 %) and secondary formations (48 %) made substantial contributions to the ON mass. Dominant primary ON sources included coal combustion and vehicle emissions, accounting for 21 % each. Five significant secondary formation processes involving ON formation were identified, namely, nitrate formation (14 %), photochemical formation (10 %), nitroaromatics formation (7 %), dicarboxylic acids (DCA) formation (8 %), and oxygenated cooking OA (7 %). DCA formation-related ON probably represented reduced N-containing organic species such as imidazoles and amides. Nitrate formation processes produced OA with a very low organic carbon-to-ON ratio, suggesting a heterogeneous/aqueous formation of organic nitrates. Our fieldwork provides first quantitative source analysis and new insights into the secondary formation processes of ON aerosols in an urban atmosphere."

Wiltink;Hartwig Deneke;Chiel C. van Heerwaarden;Jan Fokke Meirink,Evaluating parallax and shadow correction methods for global horizontal irradiance retrievals from Meteosat SEVIRI,"Global horizontal irradiance retrievals from satellite observations are affected by spatial displacements due to parallax and cloud shadows. We assess different approaches to correct for these displacements and quantify their added value by comparison with a network of ground-based pyranometer observations. The corrections are found to become increasingly important at higher spatial resolutions and are most relevant for variable cloud types. 
 Satellite-derived global horizontal irradiance (GHI) is an excellent data source for nowcasting solar power generation and validating weather and climate models. To obtain a good match between satellite-derived GHI and surface observations of GHI,  precise geolocation of the satellite GHI is an essential factor in addition to the accuracy of the retrieval. The geolocation of satellite retrievals is affected by parallax, a displacement between the actual and apparent position of a cloud, as well as by a displacement between the actual position of a shadow and the retrieved position of the shadow, which, due to the one-dimensional (1D) radiative transfer assumption, is directly below the cloud.  This study evaluates different approaches to correcting Meteosat Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) retrievals for parallax and cloud shadow displacements using ground-based observations from a unique network of 99 pyranometers deployed during the HD(CP)2 Observational Prototype Experiment (HOPE) field campaign in Jülich, Germany, in 2013. The first method provides geometric corrections for the displacements calculated using retrieved cloud top heights (Hc). The second method relies on empirical collocation shifting. Here, the collocation shift of the satellite grid is determined by maximizing the correlation between the satellite retrievals and ground-based observations. This optimum shift is determined either based on daily or time-step-averaged correlations. The time-step-averaged collocation shift correction generally yields the most accurate results, but a major drawback of this method is its reliance on ground measurements. The geometric correction, which does not have this disadvantage, achieves the most accurate results if a combined parallax and shadow correction is performed. It reduces the GHI root mean square error (RMSE) by 11.7 W m−2 (10.8 %) compared to the uncorrected retrieval.  Separate parallax or shadow corrections do not reach this level of accuracy. In fact, depending on the cloud regime, they may even increase the error compared to the uncorrected retrieval. In some cases, particularly when multilevel clouds are present, the retrieval accuracy improves if the geometric correction is based on a reduced Hc. Finally, it is demonstrated that GHI becomes increasingly sensitive to the applied correction at higher spatial resolutions, especially for variable cloud regimes. This has important implications for the retrieval accuracy of the current generation of geostationary satellites with spatial resolutions down to 500 m."

Here, we measured fluorescent bio-aerosols in the Finnish sub-Arctic with a high time resolution. A data set that might improve our understanding of biosphere–cloud interactions and the dynamics of bio-aerosols in the atmosphere. 
 Fluorescent aerosol particles (FAPs), as a fraction of total aerosol particles (TAPs), were measured online with a Wideband Integrated Bioaerosol Sensor 5/NEO (WIBS, Droplet Measurement Technologies) from mid-September to mid-December during the Pallas Cloud Experiment 2022 (PaCE22) at the station of Sammaltunturi, located in the sub-Arctic region of Finnish Lapland. The WIBS measures particle size distributions from 0.5 to 30 µm and fluorescence in three channels of single aerosol particles, as well as particle concentrations. Since biological aerosol particles can exhibit intrinsic fluorescence, FAP concentration can be used as a proxy for primary biological aerosol particles (PBAPs) like bacteria, fungal spores and pollen. The concentrations and size distributions of different fluorescent particles, together with meteorological data and air mass trajectories, allow valuable insights into the emission of PBAPs from northern boreal forests and their dynamic in the atmosphere. We found a clear seasonal trend for most FAP types and a strong, sudden decrease in concentration after the surrounding ground is covered in snow. Caution should be taken in interpreting the data as interference may be introduced by non-biological fluorescent particles like secondary organic aerosols or soot, as well as biological secondary organic aerosols.

Wells;Jinghui Lian;Bo Zheng,Global biogenic isoprene emissions 2013–2020 inferred from satellite isoprene observations,"We present the first global, multi-year maps of monthly isoprene emissions (2013–2020) derived from satellite isoprene observations, averaging 456 TgC yr-1. The dataset reveals two emission peaks linked to 2015–2016 El Niño and 2019–2020 extreme heat events, driven mainly by tropical regions such as the Amazon. It highlights the region-specific sensitivity of biogenic isoprene emissions to temperature anomalies, providing new insights into their roles in air quality and climate feedbacks. 
 Isoprene, the most emitted biogenic volatile organic compound, exerts a remarkable influence on atmospheric oxidation capacity, air quality, and climate. Most existing top-down atmospheric estimates of isoprene emissions rely on observational formaldehyde (HCHO) as an indirect proxy, introducing substantial uncertainties due to complex and nonlinear chemical pathways. Recent advances in satellite retrievals of isoprene concentrations from the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) enable a direct constraint on isoprene emission inversions. Yet global, multi-year isoprene-based atmospheric inversions are still lacking. Here, we present global, monthly biogenic isoprene emission maps spanning 2013–2020, derived from a mass-balance inversion framework that assimilates CrIS-retrieved isoprene columns into the LMDZ-INCA chemistry–transport model. The global biogenic isoprene emissions average is of 456 ± 200 TgC yr-1 over 2013–2020, which is broadly consistent with existing inventories and HCHO-based inversion estimates. The LMDZ-INCA simulations using this estimate of the emissions exhibit improved spatial agreement and reduced biases relative to two independent satellite HCHO retrieval products and to surface observations, confirming the robustness of this inversion framework. The seasonal cycle of emissions is dominated by the Northern Hemisphere, driven by the strong seasonality in temperature and vegetation biomes. Interannually, emissions vary by on average 14 TgC yr-1 (1-sigma standard deviation). Two major emission peaks are found in 2015–2016 (456 TgC yr-1) and 2019–2020 (478 TgC yr-1), coinciding with El Niño and widespread extreme heat-wave events, underscoring the dominant influence of temperature anomalies that increase biogenic emissions. Regional analyses identify the Amazon as the largest contributor to the interannual variability, accounting for 22.3 % of the global interannual variance in isoprene emissions. Temperature emerges as the primary driver of regional interannual emissions, with its influence modulated by leaf area index, precipitation, and radiation to varying degrees across regions. As one of the earliest attempts at a global, multi-year inversion based on isoprene observations, this dataset provides input for air quality and climate-chemistry models.

The imagers give consistent emission estimates, with EMIT and EnMAP having better sensitivity than PRISMA. Total observed emissions add up to 230 ± 15 t h–1, representing 5% of reported global solid waste emissions. Our estimates exceed the facility-level Climate TRACE inventory by a factor of 1.8, while we only detect emissions from 9 of the inventory’s 20 highest-emitting sites, highlighting the importance of facility-level information. Furthermore, multimonth observations reveal emission patterns potentially linked to facility operations.

Slowik;André S. H. Prévôt;Kaspar R. Daellenbach,Organic Solvents-Based Offline Aerosol Mass Spectrometry (SOff-AMS) for Comprehensive Chemical Characterization of Ambient Organic Aerosol,"The chemical composition of atmospheric aerosols is frequently investigated offline via mass spectrometry techniques. The established offline aerosol mass spectrometry (Off-AMS) uses water for extracting airborne particulate filter samples, efficiently detecting water-soluble constituents of organic aerosols (OA), which are prevalent in secondary OA (SOA), oxygenated primary OA (POA), and aged POA. Consequently, sources with substantial water-insoluble fraction may be undetectable via Off-AMS or be subject to increased uncertainties due to the absence of useful markers (e.g., polycyclic aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons). This potentially compromises the investigation of primary and less-aged OA from diverse anthropogenic sources (e.g., traffic, coal combustion, waste burning, tire wear, among others). Here, we present a new analytical method that combines Off-AMS with organic solvent-based sample extraction (termed: SOff-AMS) to extract and quantify both aged and fresh aerosols simultaneously. Ultrahigh-purity methanol and high-purity acetone were used, alongside water as a reference, and the extracts were reaerosolized to be analyzed via a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (ToF-AMS). Multiseason airborne particulate matter (PM) filter samples collected in urban and rural environments were used in these tests. The organic solvents extracted substantially higher fractions of organic carbon, which for winter samples ranged from 45 to 85% of the total organic carbon in comparison to 12–40% in water alone. The AMS spectra of samples extracted in organic solvents showed significantly increased contributions from OA fragments that are known tracers of fresh and aged emissions. These included small and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and oxygenated and reduced nitrogen-containing fragments that were enhanced over a broad range of factors (1.2–50). A comparison with an online quadrupole aerosol chemical speciation mass spectrometer (Q-ACSM) in Krakow showed highly similar spectra, demonstrating that SOff-AMS-based offline measurements can provide very similar information as the online data. Future SOff-AMS-based source apportionment could identify air pollution sources more comprehensively regardless of sampling locations, particle sizes, and seasonal conditions, especially in complex urban areas with both primary and secondary source contributors."

While the observed sulfate-to-total-sulfur ratio remained relatively constant at ∼30% in summer, this fraction increased from ∼10% to ∼20% in winter from 2004 to 2013 and then remained at ∼20%. The rise in sulfate-to-total-sulfur ratio resulted in a slower decrease of sulfate in 2004–2013 compared to 2013–2023 despite a greater reduction of SO2 in the earlier decade, reflecting a significant decline in the efficacy of SO2 emission reduction in improving air quality in winter. The decrease in efficacy is attributed to the increased oxidation of SO2 in winter because of the diminishing oversupply of SO2 compared to the availability of atmospheric oxidant, H2O2. Consequently, the seasonal differences in SO2 and sulfate concentrations between summer and winter have narrowed. This chemical damping effect, caused by limited oxidant availability, is likely to delay the reduction in sulfate concentrations in other polluted regions where the transition from coal to natural gas in power plants or alternative energy sources has not progressed as rapidly as in the United States."

These observations show that biomass burning is the dominant source of PAN in the Southern Hemisphere (SH). In the Northern Hemisphere, anthropogenic emissions from Asia and Europe also contribute significantly to PAN over the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Model simulations underestimate PAN in the lower troposphere, in part, due to the underestimation of local production driven by acetaldehyde oxidation and βNO2 ${\beta }_{{\text{NO}}_{2}}$ (the ratio of acetyl peroxy radicals reacting with NO2 relative to other pathways). The significant impacts of biomass burning evident in the ATom PAN observations suggest that improving model treatment of plume transport and the conversion of NOx to PAN in biomass burning plumes is a viable focus for better simulating PAN.

 The Los Angeles wildfires of January 2025 caused more than 250 billion dollars in damage and lasted for nearly an entire month before containment. Following our previous work, the Digital Twin Building, we modify and leverage the multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework as well as the cloud-mapping integration to study the air quality during the Los Angeles wildfires. Recent advances in large language models have allowed for out-of-the-box automated large-scale data analysis. We use a multi-agent large language system comprised of an Instructor agent and Worker agents. Upon receiving the users’ instructions, the Instructor agent retrieves the data from the cloud platform and produces instruction prompts to the Worker agents. The Worker agents then analyze the data and provide summaries. The summaries are finally input back into the Instructor agent, which then provides the final data analysis. We test this system’s capability for data-based policy recommendation by assessing our Large Language Model System with Instructor–Worker Architecture’s health recommendations and numerical summarizations based on the air quality data during the Los Angeles wildfires."

The significant reduction in anthropogenic aerosol emissions, especially across the most polluted Indo-Gangetic Plain, led to a marked decrease in aerosol optical depth (AOD), altering regional cloud-aerosol interactions and radiative effects. A rise in ENSO-compensated lightning FRD and an increase in thunderstorm days (TDs) were associated with aerosol depletion, suggesting a favorable environment for convective initiation under relatively cleaner atmospheric conditions over the extremely polluted region. The reduced AOD likely led to enhanced surface heating and decreased upper-level warming, reversing the previously stable stratification caused by very high aerosol loading. This natural instability favored the formation of a greater number of widespread thunderstorms. However, the observed reduction in lightning FRD per TD during the pandemic year indicates that, while more storms formed, each storm exhibited lower electrification, likely due to diminished cloud condensation nuclei. Relatively lower aerosol concentrations can promote an increase in storm frequency through radiative destabilization of the atmosphere. However, these relatively cleaner conditions also tend to reduce lightning frequency within individual storms, as the limited presence of aerosols constrains non-inductive charging processes in clouds. Thus, environments with fewer aerosols are associated with more frequent storm development but a decrease in lightning flashes per storm, reflecting a complex interplay between atmospheric composition and convective electrification. These insights advance understanding of convective storm responses to aerosol variability and have important implications for future atmospheric electrification trends under changing emission scenarios. This dual effect highlights the complexity of aerosol–cloud-precipitation-electrification interactions. It has implications for understanding convective weather responses to air quality changes and future climate scenarios driven by aerosol management strategies."

Murray;Drew Shindell;Kostas Tsigaridis;Nathan Luke Abraham;James Keeble,Climate forcing due to future ozone changes: an intercomparison of metrics and methods,"We used 7 climate models that include atmospheric chemistry and find that in a scenario with weak controls on air quality, the warming effects (over 2015 to 2050) of decreases in ozone-depleting substances and increases in air quality pollutants are approximately equal and would make ozone the second highest contributor to warming over this period. We find that for stratospheric ozone recovery, the standard measure of climate effects underestimates a more comprehensive measure. 
 This study assesses three different measures of radiative forcing (instantaneous: IRF; stratospheric-temperature adjusted: SARF; effective: ERF) for future changes in ozone. These use a combination of online and offline methods. We separate the effects of changes in ozone precursors and ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) and configure model experiments such that only ozone changes (including consequent changes in humidity, clouds and surface albedo) affect the evolution of the model physics and dynamics.In the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 3-7.0 (SSP3-7.0) we find robust increases in ozone due to future increases in ozone precursors and decreases in ODSs, leading to a radiative forcing increase from 2015 to 2050 of 0.268 ± 0.084 W m−2 ERF, 0.244 ± 0.057 W m−2 SARF and 0.288 ± 0.101 W m−2 IRF. This increase makes ozone the second largest contributor to future warming by 2050 in this scenario, approximately half of which is due to stratospheric ozone recovery and half due to tropospheric ozone precursors.Increases in ozone are found to decrease the cloud fraction, causing an overall negative adjustment to the radiative forcing (positive in the short wave but negative in the long wave). Non-cloud adjustments due to water vapour and albedo changes are positive. ERF is slightly larger than the offline SARF for the total ozone change but approximately double the SARF for the ODS-driven change (0.156 ± 0.071 W m−2 ERF, 0.076 ± 0.025 W m−2 SARF). Hence ERF is a more appropriate metric for diagnosing the climate effects of stratospheric ozone changes."

Bioaerosols are the major source of INPs at high temperatures, while mineral dust influences the global INP population at lower temperatures. These particles can satisfactorily reproduce INPs in a climate model. 
 Aerosol–cloud interactions, particularly ice processes in mixed-phase clouds (MPCs), remain a key source of uncertainty in climate change assessments. This study introduces state-of-the-art laboratory-based parameterizations into a global chemistry–transport model to investigate the contributions of mineral dust (specifically K-feldspar and quartz), marine primary organic aerosol (MPOA), and terrestrial primary biological aerosol particles (PBAPs) to ice-nucleating particles (INPs) in MPCs. The model suggests that INPs originating from PBAPs (INPPBAP) are the primary source of INPs at low altitudes between −10 and −20 °C, particularly in the tropics, with a pronounced peak in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) during the boreal summer. INPPBAP contributes over 40 % of the total simulated INP column burden at midlatitudes. Dust-derived INPs (INPD) are prominent at high altitudes across all seasons, dominating at temperatures below −20 °C, and they constitute over 89 % of the INP average column burden at high latitudes in the NH and about 74 % at high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere (SH). MPOA-derived INPs (INPMPOA) prevail in the SH at low altitudes, particularly at subpolar and polar latitudes for temperatures above −20 °C, where they represent between 17 % and 36 % of the INP column population, depending on the season. When evaluated against available global observational INP data, the model achieves its highest predictability across all temperature ranges when both INPD and INPMPOA are included as independent INP sources. The addition of INPPBAP does not enhance the model's ability to reproduce the available observations; however, INPPBAP remains a key contributor to warm-temperature ice-nucleation events. Therefore, consideration of dust, marine aerosol, and terrestrial bioaerosols as distinct INP species is required to simulate ice nucleation in climate models."

In addition, it outputs tropospheric partial column-averaged mole fractions (not provided by any of the two individual data sets). We briefly document their increased potential for quantifying near-surface methane emissions. 
 Data products of atmospheric methane (CH4) with improved vertical sensitivity in the lower troposphere are crucial for gaining a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of anthropogenic emissions. This study presents a CH4 data product derived from the synergetic combination of level 2 (L2) data from TROPOMI (Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument) and IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer), specifically CH4 total column and CH4 profiles, respectively. IASI enables high-quality observation of CH4 mixing ratios in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, and TROPOMI observations excel in providing sensitivity to the total column-averaged mixing ratio of CH4. By combining the IASI and TROPOMI L2 products synergetically, we can detect tropospheric CH4 (mixing ratios averaged over a layer from the surface up to 450 hPa) that is not significantly affected by the strong CH4 variations around the tropopause. This is not achievable by using IASI or TROPOMI data alone."

Validation confirms high accuracy. This breakthrough empowers researchers and to reliably analyze clouds' roles in climate change, weather patterns, and extreme events. 
 The use of remote sensing to accurately measure cloud properties and their spatial and temporal variability has become an important area of atmospheric science research. However, the heterogeneity of data formats across national agencies and the calibrate and navigate associated with the use of data from different agencies have prevented the climate research community from using the full continuum of global cloud physical properties products. In this paper, All-day Global Cloud Physical Properties (AGCPP) is proposed, which provides cloud physical properties covering nearly the entire globe, from latitude -70° to 70° and longitude -180° to 180°. The main attributes of this dataset include cloud phase, cloud top height, cloud optical thickness, and cloud effective radius, with a time range from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2022. AGCPP combines the observational advantages of geostationary satellites and polar-orbiting satellites. It uses the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Level-2 cloud product (MOD06/MYD06) to train the cloud-based attention-UNet (CloudAtUNet) model, and then evaluates AGCPP using MOD06/MYD06 and the Cloud–Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarisation (CALIOP) 1 km cloud layer product. The evaluation results indicate that AGCPP demonstrates excellent continuity and consistency in both temporal and spatial accuracy, as well as high consistency in diurnal accuracy. Due to the long time series and all-day global nature of the dataset, it is expected that the dataset AGCPP will significantly increase the potential for climate change research, particularly with respect to potential feedback effects between clouds, surface albedo, and radiation.

This study demonstrates the complementary roles of these two types of monitoring. Using data from the Hong Kong air quality monitoring network of 15 stations, we identified 37 city-scale haze episodes between November 2020 and May 2021, defined by PM2.5 concentrations exceeding 25 μg m–3. Hourly to bihourly measurements of PM2.5 chemical compositions─including molecular and elemental tracers─at a supersite enabled PM2.5 source identification and apportionment. Strong correlations in PM2.5 and trace element concentrations between the general stations and the supersite indicate spatial homogeneity of air pollution across Hong Kong during these episodes. Variations in the air mass origin and source intensity were found to significantly influence city-scale PM2.5 levels. Source apportionment based on the tracer measurements revealed dynamic changes in source contributions under different atmospheric conditions. Our findings demonstrate that detailed chemical characterization and source apportionment at a supersite can provide quantitative source insights into city-scale haze events, thus supporting the development of more targeted air pollution control strategies at a city level, such as Hong Kong and similar megacities."

 Antarctica, long regarded as one of the last pristine environments on Earth, is increasingly affected by human activity. As tourism surges and scientific operations expand, air pollution from local emissions is raising new environmental concerns. Here we analyse surface snow samples collected along a ~2,000-km transect, from the South Shetland Islands (62° S) to the Ellsworth Mountains (79° S), to map the geochemical fingerprints of aerosol deposition. We identify distinct spatial patterns shaped by crustal, marine, biogenic and anthropogenic sources. Notably, we detect heavy metal imprints in the snow chemistry of the northern Antarctic Peninsula, where major research stations are concentrated and marine tourism traffic is most intense.

 Interactions between anthropogenic and biogenic volatile organic compounds (AVOCs and BVOCs) widely exist in the atmosphere, but the resultant secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation is still poorly understood. When the two commonly widespread AVOC and BVOC, toluene and isoprene, coexisted and oxidized, we observed >20% reduction in the SOA yields compared to the predicted ones from linear addition. By resolving the particle mass spectra using positive matrix factorization, we found that SOA formation from the isoprene+toluene mixture was dominated by the isoprene-related (F-ISO-1 and F-ISO-2) and toluene-related (F-TOL-1 and F-TOL-2) factors during the early and later stages, respectively. Additionally, we observed the formation of cross-products (F-MIX) between isoprene and toluene oxidation intermediates, which accounted for ~30% of the total SOA mass on average. The formation of F-MIX was accompanied by the suppression of particulate products (F-ISO-2 and F-TOL-2), which were associated with the oxidation of ISOPOOH and later-stage oxidation of toluene. Overall, our results highlight the complex interplay between BVOCs and AVOCs and the resultant nonlinear SOA formation in real atmospheres."

 Anthropogenic emission inventories serve not only as key inputs for chemical transport models but also as essential tools for evaluating the effectiveness of emission control measures. Here, this study employed the emission inventory from Chinese Unified Atmospheric Chemistry Environment model (CCES) to analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of China's anthropogenic emissions from 2015 to 2024, and to evaluate its performance in simulating aerosols and their gaseous precursors. Furthermore, this study compared CCES with the Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC) and the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) to explore the emission discrepancies. National total anthropogenic emissions declined markedly over the decade: sulfur dioxide (SO2) dropped by 60.8 %, while emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤10 μm (PM10) and ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5), carbon monoxide (CO) and ammonia (NH3) decreased by 19.9–42.6 %. The three inventories exhibited decreases during 2015–2020, but the reduction rates for SO2, PM2.5 and PM10 slowed after 2018. Although the inventories diverged substantially in absolute magnitude, they displayed nearly identical seasonal patterns. Relative to MEIC, EDGAR reported higher industrial SO2 emissions, whereas CCES yielded higher traffic-related NOx emissions. CCES-driven simulations reproduced spatiotemporal variability of SO2, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and PM2.5 concentrations, albeit with negative biases for SO2 and PM2.5 and a positive bias for NO2 at most monitoring sites. Despite these remaining uncertainties, CCES can capture the dominant spatiotemporal patterns of China's emissions and thus provide valuable insights into their variability."

SON weakens to +30 % and −10 %. •Fine aerosols drive PM2.5 shifts-East TCs boost large fine particles, West TCs link to ultrafine aerosols. 
 Air pollution, particularly PM2.5 (particles smaller than 2.5 μm), is a major environmental issue in densely populated cities like Hong Kong, as these particles can deeply penetrate the respiratory system. It has been known that tropical cyclones (TCs) can cause a significant increase in PM2.5 concentrations when positioned to the east of Hong Kong. However, the seasonal variations in how the proximity of TCs influences PM2.5 levels and aerosol optical properties in Hong Kong remain poorly understood. Using observations from 1999 to 2020, this study demonstrates that the impact of TCs on air pollution in Hong Kong is more pronounced during the summer (June to August) compared to the autumn season (September to November), primarily due to strong subsidence, surface warming, and the transport of fine-mode aerosols by northerly wind driven by eastern TCs. Conversely, western TCs efficiently remove pollutants in summer due to the influx of clean air from southerly winds, but this effect diminishes in autumn when background PM2.5 levels are high and TC-induced subsidence is absent. Further analysis of aerosol properties reveals that eastern (western) TCs tend to increase (decrease) the fine-mode fraction and decrease (increase) the fine-mode Angström exponent during the JJA season, whereas these differences are negligible during the SON season."

A quantitative comparison between the pure rotational and vibrational–rotational Raman lidar approaches is presented. A minor impact of a wrong Ångström exponent on the determined aerosol optical properties is found. 
 Vertical profiles of aerosol properties are essential for assessing the impact of aerosols on cloud formation and the Earth's radiation budget. Lidars can provide profiles of the particle backscatter and extinction coefficients and the extinction-to-backscatter ratio (lidar ratio). An Ångström exponent has to be assumed when computing these profiles from nitrogen vibrational–rotational  Raman signals. This assumption introduces uncertainties. An alternative approach is the rotational Raman lidar method, which does not need an Ångström exponent as input. This study presents a quantitative comparison between the pure rotational and vibrational–rotational Raman lidar approaches to assess the impact of the Ångström exponent assumption on the vibrational–rotational Raman lidar solutions. In this short article, we present four contrasting case studies based on observations of wildfire smoke, Saharan dust, residential wood combustion smoke, and a cirrus layer. The optical properties are derived at a wavelength of 532 nm, with the rotational Raman signals measured at 530 nm and the vibrational–rotational Raman signals measured at 607 nm. It was found that the use of an Ångström exponent, deviating by 1 from the true value, introduces relative uncertainties of 5 % and less (backscatter coefficient), 5 %–10 % (extinction coefficient), and around 10 % (lidar ratio) in the vibrational–rotational Raman lidar solutions."

However, reported metal oxides for O3 decomposition are predominantly crystalline and often suffer from low active site exposure and easy deactivation. Here, fully amorphous Ce/C-doped Mn2O3 materials with tailor-made macro-mesopores and electronic properties are developed. The synthesis is enabled by forming amorphous metal–organic coordination composites between histidine and atomically mixed metal ions, which are thermally converted to hierarchically porous amorphous Mn2O3 due to the Ce/C doping in the Mn2O3 skeleton and the self-bubbling and reductive roles of histidine. They demonstrate superior activity and stability in O3 decomposition under wide relative humidity (RH, 0–80%), capable of completely eliminating 50 ppm O3 for >25 h at 60% RH and a high velocity of 600 L g–1 h–1. Spectroscopic and theoretical studies unravel the structure–performance correlation and reaction mechanism. The superior performance originates from the amorphous Mn2O3 providing rich Mn3+ sites and a high surface area for O3 adsorption and activation, the Ce/C doping for promoting suitable electron transfer and inhibiting H2O and O22– accumulation, and the macro-mesopore structure for enhancing mass transfer and weakening H2O adsorption and condensation."

Alkylnitrates produced in the oxidation of biogenically- and anthropogenically derived alkenes dominate the budget, but nitroaromatics also make a significant contribution. The GC–CIMS observations illustrate that the nighttime alkylnitrates are generated via reaction of alkenes with the nitrate radical and that the resulting nitrooxy-peroxy radicals react with both HO2 to form hydroperoxides and other RO2 to form primarily nitrooxy carbonyls. Aerosol organic nitrates on PM1.0 make up approximately a quarter of the total organic nitrates during daytime and nearly half at night."

Such eruptions can affect climate through the formation of sulfate aerosols and subsequent impacts on clouds. As different atmospheric conditions modulate the cloud and climate responses to aerosol perturbations, a pre‐industrial effusive eruption might have different climate impacts were it to happen today or in the future. Here we use an Earth system model to simulate the surface climate response to Icelandic effusive volcanic eruptions under pre‐industrial, present day, and end of the 21st century climate conditions. For the last case, high anthropogenic greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions are assumed. We find that the climate state significantly modulates the climate response, especially in the Arctic where we model amplified surface warming during winter under pre‐industrial conditions and stronger surface cooling during summer in warmer climates."

If uncorrected, these biases can distort inverse analyses of satellite methane column observations (e.g., GOSAT), which encompass contributions from both the troposphere and the stratosphere, and lead to erroneous estimates of surface emissions and tropospheric sinks. To overcome this limitation and advance methane modeling, we developed and evaluated several novel bias correction approaches (e.g., empirically derived polynomial correction, age‐of‐air proxy correction, and offline correction by replacing the stratospheric fields with observations). Crucially, we implemented the first online correction by assimilating independent satellite observations (e.g., ACE‐FTS and MIPAS), dynamically accounting for interannual variabilities and stratosphere‐troposphere exchange (STE) processes. These innovative methods yield significant quantitative improvements: correcting for stratospheric biases on average resulted in a 22‐Tg a−1 increase in inferred global methane emissions from GOSAT data, but with notable differences among methods (3–54 Tg a−1). The correction increased extratropical emissions by 47 (26–101) Tg a−1 but decreased tropical emissions by 24 (11–47) Tg a−1, highlighting a substantial impact on regional emission apportionment. Our results also indicate that stratospheric biases can distort tropospheric simulation through STE, potentially affecting the analysis of surface methane observations. This work provides essential methodological advancements—particularly the online correction framework—for robust global methane budget quantification, significantly reducing uncertainties in satellite‐based inversions."

However, a discrepancy exists between the Weather Research and Forecasting model, which uses resolved convection, and CTMs, which rely on a diagnostic convective cloud scheme, in handling high‐resolution convective wet scavenging simulations. To explore the uncertainties arising from this disparity, this study focuses on 137Cs, released during the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, as a species with numerous observations compared to other radionuclides and minimal interference from other factors using the NAQPMS model incorporating a physically‐based wet deposition module. A diagnostic convective cloud scheme was applied, using a radar composite reflectivity factor (RCRF) of 35 dBZ to identify convective precipitation. Implementing the RCRF diagnosis scheme significantly improved model performance by increasing in‐cloud deposition. This enhancement led to a 46%–48% increase in total deposition in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area.

Here, we evaluate seven upstream oil and gas methane super-emitter events to examine the safety (explosivity) risks from methane and the short-term, noncancer health risks from benzene and other key co-emitted non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs). We used airborne instrument and satellite-measured methane emissions rates to estimate hourly air concentrations of methane using US EPA’s American Meteorological Society/Environmental Protection Agency Regulatory Model (AERMOD), a regulatory-grade dispersion model, and applied estimated speciated NMVOC-methane molar ratios to calculate hourly air concentrations of NMVOCs. We assessed when and where hourly modeled methane and NMVOC air concentrations exceeded national safety (0.5% methane) and state-based health (8 ppb and 53 ppb benzene) benchmarks. Large methane super-emitters (>2900 kg hr−1) had safety benchmark exceedances as far as 270 m from the source, indicating that safety risks are greatest for facility workers and nearby communities. Health benchmark exceedances were the greatest and most frequent close to the source (<300 m), but, in contrast to the safety risks, reached beyond one kilometer (1.1–19 km) for modeled methane super-emitters (210–15 800 kg hr−1), posing health risks to residents and sensitive populations. We also found that smaller methane super-emitters may pose outsized health risks: our second lowest methane emission case (539 kg hr−1) yielded the highest benzene air concentration (28 000 ppb), farthest 8 ppb benzene exceedance distance (19 km), and highest frequency of health benchmark exceedances between 1–5 km (2.6%). Our study demonstrates that policies and early detection efforts that control methane super-emitters should prioritize factors beyond methane emissions rate magnitude, such as gas composition, to provide the strongest co-benefits for public health and safety."

We find a global trend towards NOx-limited regimes supported by increasing satellite-based HCHO/NO2 ratio and a diminishing ozone weekend effect. 
 Ground-level ozone (O3) formation in urban areas is nonlinearly dependent on the relative availability of its precursors: oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). To mitigate O3 pollution, a crucial question is to identify the O3 formation regime (NOx-limited or VOC-limited). Here, we leverage ground-based O3 observations alongside space-based observations of O3 precursors, namely, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and formaldehyde (HCHO), to study the long-term shifts in O3 chemical regimes across global source regions. We first derive the regime threshold values for the satellite-derived HCHO/NO2 ratio by examining its relationship with the O3 weekend effect. We find that a regime transition from VOC-limited to NOx-limited occurs around 3.1 [2.7–3.4] for HCHO/NO2 with slight regional variations. By integrating data from four satellite instruments, including Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME), SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY), Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), we built a 27-year (1996–2022) satellite HCHO/NO2 record from which we assess the long-term trends in O3 production regimes. A discernible global trend towards NOx-limited regimes is evident, particularly in developed regions such as North America, Europe, and Japan, with emerging trends in developing countries like China and India over the past 2 decades. This shift is supported by both increasing HCHO/NO2 ratios and a diminishing O3 weekend effect.

We integrated lidar and radiosonde observations to constrain the simulated aerosol profiles over North China and quantified the photochemical responses. The increased photolysis rates in the lower layers led to increased ozone and accounted for a 36 %–56 % reduction in API effects, resulting in enhanced atmospheric oxidizing capacity and aerosol formation. 
 The significance of aerosol–photolysis interaction (API) in atmospheric photochemistry has been emphasized by studies utilizing box models and chemical transport models. However, few studies have considered the actual aerosol vertical distribution when evaluating API effects due to the lack of observations and the uncertainties in model simulation. Herein, we integrated lidar and radiosonde observations with the chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) to quantify the response of photochemistry to observational constraints on aerosol vertical distribution across different seasons in North China. The underestimation of aerosol optical depth (AOD) in lower layers and the overestimation in upper layers in GEOS-Chem model were revised. In response, photolysis rates changed following AOD, showing 33.4 %–73.8 % increases at the surface. Surface ozone increased by an average of 0.9 and 0.5 ppb in winter and summer, and the default API impact on ozone reduced by 36 %–56 %. The weaker response in summer can be related to the compensatory effects of stronger turbulence mixing in the boundary layer. The long-lasting underestimation of ozone levels in winter was also greatly improved. Due to the enhanced photochemistry, PM2.5 increased by 0.8 µg m−3 in winter and 0.2 µg m−3 in summer and increased strongly during pollution events, with a maximum daily change of 16.5 µg m−3 at Beijing station in winter. The weakened API effect in turn enhanced nitric acid formation by increasing atmospheric oxidizing capacity (13.5 % increase for OH radical) in high NOx emission areas, and this helps explain the strong response of PM2.5 in winter."

Recent advances in the optical modeling of nonspherical mineral dust particles make possible more subtle interpretation of the top‐of‐atmosphere radiances acquired by the NASA Earth Observing System's Multi‐angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument. We confirm the MISR radiometrically retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD), its spectral dependence, and geometrically retrieved plume height by comparison with published results from other space‐ and surface‐based instruments. But in addition, we use the advanced MISR Research Aerosol retrieval algorithm to produce for the first time a history of changing column‐effective coarse‐mode size and light‐absorption for nonspherical dust particles during transit. Although the absolute numerical values of particle microphysical properties obtained from remote sensing tend to be qualitative, the stability of the MISR instrument, the dominance of the dust column optical depth contribution throughout the transit in this case, and the darkness and relative uniformity of the underlying ocean surface lend confidence to the retrieved trends and timescales, though plume heterogeneity, cloud contamination, and in one case sun glint contribute some additional uncertainty to the results. Such constraints offer the promise of using satellite observations beyond AOD to improve the representation of dust‐aerosol‐related processes in climate models."

In this study, we optimize the algorithm for detecting blowing snow from NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat‐2) satellite for use over Arctic sea ice. We analyze six months (November 2019 through April 2020) of observations from the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) campaign together with 612 nearly coincident (within 100 km) ICESat‐2 overpasses to evaluate the ICESat‐2 detection algorithm and inferred blowing snow properties. Both ICESat‐2 and MOSAiC suggest a blowing snow occurrence frequency of 17% during the period of study. Blowing snow particle number and inferred from ICESat‐2 show broad agreement with in situ observations made at 10 m above the surface during MOSAiC but are often well below observations made at 8 cm. Within a 100 km radius around the MOSAiC observatory, we find a cumulative blowing snow sublimation of 2.38 cm snow‐water‐equivalent (SWE), comparable to MOSAiC (2.56 cm SWE) and SnowModel‐LG (2.35 cm SWE) estimates. This suggests that blowing snow sublimation removed 22%–33% of snowfall during MOSAiC. Across the central Arctic, ICESat‐2 and SnowModel‐LG indicate blowing snow occurrence frequencies as high as 18%–25%, with cumulative blowing snow sublimation fluxes (1.74–1.79 cm SWE) removing 16%–17% of snowfall.

 Millions of lives are lost due to air pollution, underscoring the urgent need to understand the factors that influence air quality. Here, we employ a multidisciplinary approach, integrating media data analysis, behavioral experiments, and agent-based modeling to explore the impact of inaccurate air quality reports on travel behavior and actual air quality. Media analysis reveals a negative correlation between the accuracy of air pollution reports and the air quality index. Behavioral experiments demonstrate that media reports inaccurately showing good air quality reduce individuals’ perceived pollution levels, which in turn leads to increased travel behavior. Furthermore, agent-based modeling simulations show that individual changes in travel behavior can collectively lead to increased air pollutant emissions and deteriorated overall air quality.

This study investigates the chemical composition, volatility and viscosity of SOA formed by ozonolysis of cyclic α-pinene (PSOA) and acyclic ocimene (OSOA) monoterpenes. Using Temperature-Programmed Desorption combined with Direct Analysis in Real-Time ionization and High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry, we determined the molecular composition and saturation mass concentration of individual SOA constituents. These data enabled gas-particle partitioning and viscosity estimates under varied atmospheric conditions. PSOA, composed of higher molecular weight and less oxidized species, shows higher condensability and viscosity under high total organic mass (tOM) loadings. In contrast, OSOA, consisting of more oxidized, lower molecular weight species, exhibits greater sensitivity to tOM, with viscosity increasing significantly upon dilution. Poke-flow experiments support this trend, indicating that OSOA undergoes more dynamic compositional and phase changes during atmospheric aging. These observations reveal distinct dynamic trends in the atmospheric transformations and reactivity of SOA from cyclic and acyclic monoterpenes, with the latter showing greater compositional changes during aging that alter viscosity and diffusion. This highlights the importance of incorporating such dynamic transformations into atmospheric models to improve predictions of SOA atmospheric loadings, lifetimes, and impacts."

 The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region is a typical economically developed and densely populated coastal city cluster. During warm seasons, the YRD generally suffers from extreme weather when tropical cyclones (TCs) make landfall. However, the YRD is also affected by severe ozone (O3) pollution when TCs are not far away. It has been reported that the peripheral flow of TCs is related to the regional O3 pollution over the YRD. Nevertheless, the tracks and locations of TCs, as well as the mechanisms of their effects, are still unclear. This study tries to reveal how and where TCs cause regional O3 pollution in the YRD based on a comprehensive analysis of prevailing synoptic weather patterns (SWPs) and high-impact TC tracks. For weather patterns, the NCEP reanalysis data and the Principal Component Analysis in T-mode (PCT) analysis method were adopted to objectively classify the 850 hPa geopotential height field in the YRD from 2018 to 2021. By integrating the air pollution observation data and the meteorological data in the YRD of the same period, a systematic analysis of the O3 pollution characteristics and their formation mechanism under different SWPs was conducted. Meanwhile, trajectory clustering analysis was conducted on TC track data to investigate the mechanisms of TCs with different paths on O3 pollution in the YRD. The results indicate that O3 concentration in the YRD generally peaks in June and September, and regional O3 pollution usually occurs before TCs land and after TCs dissipate. The SWPs in the YRD can be categorized into seven categories. Among them, SWP3 and SWP4 are SWPs that will be affected by TCs, while SWP6 and SWP7, which have similar circulation situations, are not affected by TCs. TCs are very important weather systems in SWP3 and SWP4. Furthermore, based on O3 pollution classification under different SWPs and TC track clustering analysis, how TC trajectories and central locations affect regional O3 pollution over the YRD is revealed. Under SWP3, TCs usually have the northwest-turning track, and cause the highest O3 pollution levels in the YRD when their centers are located in the area of (130°–135°E, 20°–30°N). Downdrafts caused by western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) and the peripheral downward airflows of TCs make the air more stagnant over the YRD. The accumulation of air pollutants, as well as more intensive chemical reactions due to higher temperature, are the main cause of regional O3 pollution. For SWP4, however, TCs generally have the westward track, and regional O3 pollution in the YRD occurs when TCs are located over the area of (125°–130°E, 10°–16°N) with stronger intensities. More O3 is transported from inland polluted areas to the YRD due to the peripheral advection airflows of the strong TCs under SWP4. There are fewer downward airflows caused by TCs when the YRD is under SWP4 than under SWP3. These findings provide a new perspective on the intricate mechanisms underlying the interactions between TCs and coastal region O3 pollution. They also provide an important scientific basis for the prediction, early warning, and targeted prevention and control of severe O3 pollution in coastal cities, while also offering crucial guidance for optimizing regional air quality management strategies and formulating more precise pollution prevention and control measures."

 We examined the interannual variability in ozone (O3) and water vapor (H2O) in the lower stratospheric vortex over Antarctica using 19 years of measurements (2004–2022) from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS). We focused on the period of the southern hemisphere winter (11–20 September), late winter (21–30 September), and spring (1–10 October) because O3 and H2O dynamics show the most variation during these times. We used a low-pass filter to focus on variations lasting 10 days or longer. The Mann Kendall test and regression analysis were employed to identify linear or non-linear trends. Our findings showed that the vortex-average O3 increased at 0.01 ppm yr−1. In contrast, the vortex-averaged H₂O showed no significant trend, although localized increases in H₂O were significantly obvious across all latitudes. In addition to the well-known effects of the Montreal Protocol, we hypothesize that the localized increase in H₂O is driven by the redistribution of water vapor due to strengthened Brewer-Dobson circulation (BDC) dynamics, characterized by enhanced horizontal transport, which, however, is insufficient to induce significant changes in vortex-averaged H₂O. The observed out-of-phase trend between the vertical and horizontal branches of the BDC serves to validate our BDC speed calculation. These results highlight the complex interplay between dynamics and chemistry in the polar stratosphere, emphasizing that while O₃ recovery continues, localized changes in H₂O do not yet significantly impact the vortex-averaged H₂O levels. Our study provides new insights and observational evidence into the role of BDC dynamics and stratospheric ozone recovery, underscoring the importance of both chemical and dynamic processes in shaping the future evolution of the stratospheric ozone layer."

 In recent years, sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) retrieved from satellite platforms has been demonstrated to be a good proxy of gross primary production (GPP). However, existing data-driven methods based on singular value decomposition (SVD) commonly lead to high retrieval noise for single SIF observations, given the fact that SIF often has a low signal-to-noise ratio. Spatial and/or temporal aggregation has typically been used to reduce these noises. Such aggregation may diminish the effective spatial and/or temporal resolutions of current SIF products but potentially exacerbate uncertainty in interpreting SIF data. To address this issue, this study proposes a more precise data-driven method for retrieving SIF using an artificial neural network (ANN), which was trained using spatially aggregated SIF as the response variable and radiance in the spectral region of 743–758 nm as the explanatory variable. The feasibility of the ANN-based SIF retrieval method was first demonstrated using model simulations based on SCOPE and MODTRAN. Then, the ANN models were trained using OCO-2/3 SIF and TROPOMI radiance after careful matching of the overpass time and “sun-target-viewing” geometry. OCO-2/3 SIF, retrieved using high-spectral-resolution data within a narrow spectral window, is considered accurate and OCO-2 SIF was further validated by airborne SIF measurements. The resulting ANN model led to a high retrieval accuracy for SIF with an R2 of 0.85 and an RMSE of 0.217 mW∙m−2∙nm−1∙sr−1. Finally, the ANN-based method was adopted to produce the global TROPOMI SIF from May 2018 to December 2024. Assuming that the RMSE is representative of the average retrieval noises of single ANN-based SIF, the retrieval noises of ANN-based TROPOMI SIF were approximately half of the reported noises of SVD-based TROPOMI SIF. The advantage of the low retrieval noise of ANN-based SIF was proven in interpreting the seasonal patterns of SIF and estimating GPP compared with SVD-based SIF. This study provides a new insight into SIF retrieval, and the resulting ANN-based SIF product would contribute to better global carbon cycle observations."

Most frequently, measurements of air concentration are used for such purposes. Our research shows that, while air concentration data can provide more precise results, deposition measurements can still effectively pinpoint the release location, offering a less costly and more versatile alternative. 
 Inverse modelling of atmospheric releases of radioactivity consists of reconstructing the release source by combining radiological field measurements with atmospheric transport calculations. This is typically performed with air concentration measurements, although deposition measurements or gamma dose rate measurements could also be used. In this paper, we assess the use of deposition measurements of radioactivity in this context. This is done through a case study of the undisclosed release of the radionuclide 106Ru in Eurasia during the autumn of 2017. The atmospheric transport model we utilize for this purpose is FLEXPART. Inverse modelling is performed with the inverse modelling tool FREAR (Forensic Radionuclide Event Analysis and Reconstruction), which has been modified to work with deposition measurements. The inversion consists of Bayesian and cost-function-based algorithms to reconstruct the initial source properties. Inverse modelling is applied to both real and synthetic-deposition data following the 106Ru release. We also construct synthetic air concentration data for use in inverse modelling to make a comparison with the results using deposition data. It is found that source localization is feasible with both the synthetic and real-world deposition data. Synthetic air concentration measurements lead to more precise source localization than deposition. It is demonstrated that this can be explained by the lower detection limits of air concentration measurements compared to deposition."

 A mobile sampler for collecting aerosol particles on an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) was developed and tested during three consecutive Pallas cloud experiment campaigns in the vicinity of the Sammaltunturi Global Atmosphere Watch site (67°58′ N, 24°7′ E, 565 m above sea level) in Finland. The sampler is designed to collect aerosol particles onto Nuclepore filters, which are subsequently analysed for the temperature-dependent number concentration of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) of the sampled aerosol using a freezing assay. The sampler was flown with a fixed-wing UAV in different altitudes up to 1000 m above ground level (a.g.l). The total flight times ranged from 60 min to around 100 min, depending on environmental conditions. Pressure, temperature and relative humidity were also measured to provide information about the meteorological flight conditions. The flow over the filter was maintained by a micro-diaphragm pump, providing approximately 10 standard litres per minute over a small filter (diameter of 25 mm) and around 11 standard litres per minute over a larger filter (diameter of 47 mm) at a pressure corresponding to 500 m above sea level. For a typical flight time of 1.5 h, this results in a sampled air volume of approximately 930 to 1000 standard litres per flight, giving an INP detection limit of approximately 1.1×10-3 and 1.0×10-3 INPs per standard litre, respectively. For comparison to the flight results, a similar set-up was deployed at ground level. The comparison shows a clear distinction from the water and handling blank background for both set-ups, proving the technical feasibility of the set-ups. Furthermore, for some flights, a shift between the two INP populations can be seen, indicating that ground-based INP measurements deviate from the samples collected on board the UAV."

The current study constructed an instrumental system (HEAC (high-efficiency aerosol collector)/ESI (electrospray ionisation)-Orbitrap-MS (mass spectrometer)) for the real-time chemical analysis of aerosol samples. The combined system successfully identified over 30 chemical compounds in aerosol samples in real time, showing the robustness of the technique for the chemical characterisation of aerosols under atmospherically relevant conditions. 
 The chemical properties of aerosols in the atmosphere significantly influence their impact on the global climate forcing and human health. However, a real-time molecular-level characterisation of aerosols remains challenging due to the complex nature of their chemical composition.  The current study constructed an instrumental system for the real-time chemical characterisation of aerosol particles. The proposed setup consists of a custom-built high-efficiency aerosol collector (HEAC) used to collect aerosol samples into a working fluid and an electrospray ionisation (ESI) Orbitrap mass spectrometer (MS) for the subsequent chemical analysis of the liquid sample. The HEAC/ESI-Orbitrap-MS was calibrated against six chemical compounds – vanillic acid (VA), adonitol, erythritol, tricarballylic acid (TCA), sucrose, and trehalose – to investigate the system's sensitivity and limit of detection (LOD). Results showed that the coupled system has high sensitivities to the tested chemical compounds and a similar, if not better, LOD than other related instrumental techniques. The 3σ LOD of the tested compounds ranged from 1.1 ± 0.14 ng m−3 (erythritol) to 65 ± 7.4 ng m−3 (TCA). The capability of the HEAC/ESI-Orbitrap-MS system to identify the chemical composition of organic aerosols (OAs) was also examined. Sample OA was generated by α-pinene ozonolysis, and the chemical characterisation results were compared to similar studies. Our data showed that the HEAC/ESI-Orbitrap-MS system can identify most of the α-pinene ozonolysis products reported in the literature, including cis-pinonic acid, pinalic acid, and 3-methyl-1,2,3-butanetricarboxylic acid (MBTCA). Monomeric and dimeric reaction products were accurately identified in the mass spectra, even at a total OA mass concentration < 2 µg m−3. The present study showed that the HEAC/ESI-Orbitrap-MS system is a robust technique for the real-time chemical characterisation of OA particles under atmospherically relevant conditions."

Gunthe,Anthropogenic Emissions in Coastal India Strongly Influence New Particle Formation and Cloud Condensation Nuclei Activity,"Aerosols influence Earth’s energy balance and hydrological cycle as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), yet uncertainties persist in how anthropogenic emissions alter their abundance and climate-relevant properties. Abrupt, large-scale reductions in human activities provided a natural experiment to quantify anthropogenic impact on aerosol-cloud-climate interactions in coastal India. Combining chemical and microphysical measurements under drastically reduced and subsequently reintroduced emission scenarios, we reveal that CCN concentrations increased by 80–250% postlockdown. This surge coincided with increased new particle formation (NPF) event frequency and enhanced particle growth rates. Postlockdown air masses shifted from marine to continental sources, revealing that anthropogenic organic matter (OM), despite lower hygroscopicity, dominated particle growth to CCN-active sizes, offsetting hygroscopicity limitations. These findings demonstrate how shifts in anthropogenic activity can strongly impact aerosol–cloud interaction potential, even under varying air mass influences, and provide a reference for understanding the atmospheric effects of future air quality interventions."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108436,True,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文探讨了气溶胶对城市降水的影响，重点关注达拉斯-沃斯堡地区。研究使用WRF-Chem模型模拟了不同情景，包括有无大气化学过程、气溶胶、土地利用扰动和背景排放等，以评估这些因素对降水的影响。研究发现，城市和背景气溶胶通过改变云凝结核浓度、云水路径、潜热通量和垂直速度，显著影响云的生命周期和风暴动力学，从而影响降水。特别是在强对流事件中，人为气溶胶的激活导致了城市降水的增加。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术，但其研究的气溶胶、大气化学成分以及它们与降水的关系，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测大气成分分析）密切相关，因为遥感可以提供气溶胶和大气成分的分布和浓度信息，从而验证和改进模型模拟结果。,"['aerosols', 'urban precipitation', 'cloud condensation nuclei', 'cloud water path', 'WRF-Chem', 'atmospheric chemistry', 'air quality', 'atmospheric composition']",Giacomo Moraglia;Paola Crippa,Assessing the influence of aerosols on urban precipitation: A sensitivity study of Dallas–Fort Worth,"•Urban emissions significantly impact cloud life-cycles during a cold front. •The impact of urban emissions on a low-energy stratiform event is negligible. •Aerosol coupling in WRF-Chem may improve the forecasting of extreme precipitation over urban areas. •Advected and background aerosols contribute to shaping the life cycle of a convective system over Dallas–Fort Worth. 
 Urbanization influences tropospheric circulation, particularly around large cities. While the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect on regional rainfall is well-documented, larger uncertainties still remain for urban aerosol’s effect on precipitation. This study employs the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) to examine aerosol-driven modifications to urban precipitation in Dallas–Fort Worth, TX, during both a deep convective and a stratiform event. We generate a WRF-Chem ensemble that explores multiple scenarios, including simulations with and without atmospheric chemistry, aerosols, land use perturbations, and altered background emissions, enabling the isolation of key physical and chemical drivers of rainfall variability. From this analysis it emerges that urban and background aerosols exert a significant influence on precipitation affecting cloud life-cycle and storm dynamics through changes in cloud condensation nuclei concentrations, cloud water paths, latent heat fluxes, and vertical velocities. During the analyzed deep convective event, numerous ultrafine anthropogenic aerosols activated in the lower atmosphere, forming a transient neutral layer beneath an intrusion of dry air. This process initially suppressed convection; however, as the system evolved, convection progressively intensified through enhanced mixed-phase processes, resulting in a significant increase in urban precipitation. The absence of this aerosol-driven mechanism in the simulation without chemistry led to an underestimation of urban rainfall intensity. In contrast, no significant changes are found for the stratiform event due to land-use perturbation and aerosols. These findings highlight the importance of aerosol-cloud interactions in urban meteorology and provide insights for potentially improving weather forecasting in densely populated regions."

More aerosols generally do not make these clouds grow much taller, with an average height increase of about 1 km. However, their effects on rainfall strength and cloud expansion are less certain. Clouds influenced by sea breezes show a stronger aerosol impact, possibly due to factors that are unaccounted for like vertical winds in near-surface layers. 
 This study focuses on quantifying the conditional relationship between aerosol and convective precipitation properties of isolated deep convective clouds (DCCs) in the Houston–Galveston region, after adjusting for confounding effects. We leverage comprehensive ground-based observations from the TRacking Aerosol Convection interactions ExpeRiment (TRACER) to estimate aerosol effects on convective echo top height (ETH), intensity, and area separately. Our results show that greater aerosol number concentrations generally have a limited impact on these convective properties, showing relationships consistent with the possibility of both invigoration and suppression effects. Under certain conditions, where ultrafine particles are abundant, aerosols exhibit a positive effect on ETH, increasing it by about 1 km. However, it is inevitable to consider measurement uncertainties and the limitations of temporal and spatial resolution in the data, as these factors can further contribute to uncertainties in our estimates. In DCCs associated with sea breezes, the estimated aerosol effects on DCCs are found to be more pronounced. However, this heightened effect could be attributed to the exclusion of key confounders such as boundary layer updrafts in the analysis."

Light absorption increased, but the total direct radiative forcing efficiency was estimated to have shifted from positive to negative. The results highlight the importance of considering secondary aerosol formation when assessing the impacts of aviation. 
 Aviation is an important source of urban air pollution, but the impacts of photochemical processing on the exhaust emissions remain insufficiently characterized. Here, the physical–chemical properties of fresh and photochemically aged emissions from a laboratory-scale jet engine burner operated with JP-8 kerosene were studied in detail with a range of online and offline methods. The fresh emissions contained high amounts of organic matter present predominantly in the gaseous phase. Photochemical aging in an oxidation flow reactor caused substantial formation of oxidized organic aerosol, increasing the particle mass approximately 300-fold. During aging, aromatic hydrocarbons and alkanes in the gas-phase decayed, while gas-phase oxidation products, such as small carbonyls and oxygenated aromatics, increased. The composition of organic matter became more complex by photochemical processing, with the average particulate carbon oxidation state increasingly growing throughout the addressed exposure range (equivalent to 0.2 to 7 d in the atmosphere) with a ΔH:C/ΔO:C slope of −0.54. Simultaneously, the near-UV wavelength absorption by the particles increased due to enhanced particulate mass. The imaginary refractory indices of organic particulate matter were 0.0071 and 0.00013 at the wavelength of 520 nm for the fresh and photochemically processed particles, respectively, indicating secondary production of weakly absorbing brown carbon. The direct radiative forcing by the exhaust particles was estimated by a Mie model, which revealed a prominent shift from a warming to cooling climate effect upon photochemical aging. The results highlight the importance of considering secondary aerosol formation when assessing the environmental impacts of aviation."

We found that marine aerosols in East China Sea (ECS) and Western Pacific (WP) were significantly affected by coal and engine combustion, while those in Bismarck Sea (BS) and East Australian Sea (EAS) were mainly influenced by wildfire and coal combustion. The Antarctic Ocean (AO) was dominated by biomass burning and local shipping emissions. This finding helps elucidate the mechanism of the global PAH cycle. 
 Ambient polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their derivatives have severe adverse impacts on organism health and ecosystem safety. However, their global distributions, sources, and fate in marine aerosol remain poorly understood. To fill the knowledge gap, high-volume air samples were collected along a transect from China to Antarctica and analyzed for particulate PAHs and derivatives. The highest PAH concentrations in marine aerosols were observed in the Western Pacific (WP: 447±228pgm-3), followed by the East China Sea (ECS: 195 pg m−3), the Antarctic Ocean (AO: 111±91pgm-3), the East Australian Sea (EAS: 104±88pgm-3), and (the lowest) the Bismarck Sea (BS: 17±12pgm-3). Unexpectedly, PAH concentrations in the AO were even higher than those in the EAS and BS. This could be attributed to the relatively low anthropogenic PAH emissions from Australia and Papua New Guinea, whereas AO is often affected by emissions from engine combustion and biomass burning. In contrast to the distribution of PAHs, OPAH levels in the EAS were much higher than those in the AO. It was assumed that OPAHs mainly originated from the secondary formation of parent PAHs through reactions with O3 and OH radicals, both of which are more prevalent in the EAS.  Several source apportionment models suggested that PAHs and their derivatives in marine aerosol are dominated by three sources: coal burning and engine combustion emissions (56 %), wood and biomass burning (30 %), and secondary formation (14 %). Specifically, marine aerosols in the ECS and WP were significantly affected by coal burning and engine combustion, while those in the BS and EAS were mainly influenced by wildfire and coal combustion.  AO was primarily dominated by biomass burning and local shipping emissions."

Understanding the particles' sources is key to addressing this issue, but traditional methods require time-consuming sampling, delaying action. Our study introduces a real-time monitoring system that uses advanced instruments and software to track pollution instantly. This technology allows faster, more precise pollution analysis, helping cities create targeted strategies to improve air quality. 
 Air pollution, particularly from particulate matter (PM), poses serious public health and environmental risks, especially in urban areas. To address this, accurate source apportionment (SA) of PM is essential for effective air quality management. Traditional SA approaches often rely on offline data collection, limiting timely responses to pollution events. SA applied on data from online techniques, especially with high temporal resolution, is advantageous over offline techniques, enabling the study of the diurnal variability of emission sources and also the study of specific events. Recent technological advancements now enable real-time SA, allowing continuous, detailed analysis of pollution sources. This study presents the first application of the ACSM–Xact–Aethalometer (AXA) setup integrated with SoFi RT software for real-time source apportionment of PM in Athens, Greece. The AXA setup integrates chemical, elemental, and black carbon (BC) data streams, covering a broad spectrum of PM components and capturing a comprehensive representation of PM sources in an urban environment. SoFi RT handles data from the AXA instruments as separate inputs within a single matrix, placing them in distinct diagonal blocks. Each main instrument's data (ACSM, Xact) is processed independently, with the model applying instrument-specific constraints and generating separate source factors, effectively performing two parallel source apportionments in a single run of the ME-2 solver. Equivalent sources identified across the two instruments are then combined post-analysis to provide a unified interpretation of source contributions. The apportionment of BC to BCsf and BClf (solid fuel and liquid fuel) can be performed in either of the main instrument experiments and does not require dedicated processing. The results demonstrate that traffic-related emissions are the largest contributors to PM, with significant contributions from secondary species such as sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and secondary organic aerosols, which together accounted for approximately 57 % of the PM mass. Primary sources such as biomass burning and cooking contributed around 10 % each, with natural sources like dust and sea salt comprising the remainder. The SoFi RT software is employed for continuous SA, offering automated analysis of PM sources in near real time (minutes after the measurements). Our findings demonstrate that this setup effectively identifies major pollution sources. This work underscores the AXA system's potential for advancing urban air quality monitoring and informs targeted interventions to reduce PM pollution."

 In this work, we describe the development of the Carbon monOxide Measurement from Ames (COMA) instrument for measurement of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) aboard NASA's WB-57 high-altitude research aircraft. While COMA has previously flown in the cabin of the NASA P3 platform, here the instrument was modified to operate in a significantly different environment – an unpressurized pallet flying primarily above 12 km (40 000 ft). Modifications were made to the laser to allow for detection of CO and N2O, ruggedization and thermal management were addressed, and a calibration system was designed to quantify the measurement stability in-flight. Testing was conducted in a thermal vacuum chamber to mimic anticipated ambient conditions experienced inside the WB-57 pallet bay and found that the electronic components remained within the thermal limits. COMA was operated successfully during 9 unattended transit flights to and from South Korea and 15 research flights during NASA's Asian summer monsoon Chemical & CLImate Project (ACCLIP) 2022 campaign, which was focused on studying the Asian summer monsoon anticyclone in the western Pacific.

 Monoterpenes are key to plant communication and defence against biotic (e.g., herbivory) and abiotic (e.g., heat, drought) stress. Chiral monoterpenes, like alpha-pinene, exist as mirror image pairs, known as enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same atmospheric reactivity, but are produced and emitted by different enzymes and internal leaf mechanisms. Abiotic stress can alter their relative emissions, suggesting enantiomer ratios could indicate stress severity. Here we present (−)- and (+)-alpha-pinene and methyl salicylate measurements from the Amazon rainforest over time-of-day, season, and the 2023-24 El Niño. Correlations between alpha-pinene enantiomers shifted with stress, aligning with weakening carbon dioxide uptake by vegetation and transition between de novo and storage emissions. Low- and high-stress zones, along with a recovery zone, were defined through alpha-pinene enantiomer correlations, revealing a metric for ecosystem stress. This chiral ratio reveals diel, seasonal, El Niño, and edge effect stresses, offering a method to gauge drought severity due to climate change.

10.1016/j.rse.2025.114944,True,Remote Sensing of Environment,该研究论文主要关注利用太阳诱导叶绿素荧光（SIF）遥感技术来监测植被的生理状态。虽然其直接应用是植被监测而非大气环境监测，但它涉及利用星载（DESIS）和机载（HyPlant）光谱仪测量大气中的氧气吸收带（O2-A），并模拟大气辐射传输过程。这些技术和方法与大气成分分析、卫星观测以及大气环境遥感技术有密切联系。通过精确模拟大气效应对地表信号的影响，可以提高SIF反演的准确性，从而间接提升对植被健康状况的评估能力。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术具有一定的相关性。,"['Solar-induced fluorescence (SIF)', 'DESIS (spaceborne spectrometer)', 'HyPlant (airborne spectrometer)', 'O2-A oxygen absorption band', 'At-sensor radiance simulation', 'Vegetation monitoring', 'Photosynthesis', 'Remote sensing spectrometers']",Miguel Pato;Kevin Alonso;Jim Buffat;Stefan Auer;Emiliano Carmona;Stefan Maier;Rupert Müller;Patrick Rademske;Uwe Rascher;Hanno Scharr,Simulation framework for solar-induced fluorescence retrieval and application to DESIS and HyPlant,"•General-purpose framework developed for simulation of at-sensor radiances. •Extensive set of simulated data generated for SIF retrieval with DESIS and HyPlant. •High fidelity of simulations demonstrated by comparison to real measurements. •Simulated dataset used to train fast emulators and assess SIF retrieval performance. 
 Fluorescence light emitted by chlorophyll in plants is a direct probe of the photosynthetic process and can be used to continuously monitor vegetation status. Retrieving solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) using a machine learning (ML) approach promises to take full advantage of airborne and satellite-based instruments to map expected vegetation function over wide areas on a regular basis. This work takes a first step towards developing a ML-based SIF retrieval method. A general-purpose framework for the simulation of at-sensor radiances is introduced and applied to the case of SIF retrieval in the oxygen absorption band O2-A with the spaceborne DESIS and airborne HyPlant spectrometers. The sensor characteristics are modelled carefully based on calibration and in-flight data and can be extended to other instruments including the upcoming FLEX mission. A comprehensive dataset of simulated at-sensor radiance spectra is then assembled encompassing the most important atmosphere, geometry, surface and sensor properties. The simulated dataset is employed to train emulators capable of generating at-sensor radiances with sub-percent errors in tens of μs, opening the way for their routine use in SIF retrieval. The simulated spectra are shown to closely reproduce real data acquired by DESIS and HyPlant and can ultimately be used to develop a robust ML-based SIF retrieval scheme for these and other remote sensing spectrometers. Finally, the SIF retrieval performance of the 3FLD method is quantitatively assessed for different on- and off-band configurations in order to identify the best band combinations. This highlights how our simulation framework enables the optimization of SIF retrieval methods to achieve the best possible performance for a given instrument."

 Air pollutant dynamics are influenced by various factors, leading to complex physical and chemical interactions in the atmosphere. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enable high-resolution measurements of spatiotemporal variability in air quality across different altitudes and locations. However, comprehensive studies that integrate vertical measurements with detailed analyses of meteorological conditions and impacts of transboundary pollution are lacking. We investigated the relationship between air pollution concentrations measured by UAVs during winter and various meteorological factors. We evaluated the relationship between irradiance and surface wind based on the measured concentrations of gaseous pollutants such as CO, NO2, O3, and SO2, as well as particulate pollutants such as PM2.5. The influence of long-range transport was assessed by clustering the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) backward air trajectories. Photochemical reactions were most active in the afternoon, resulting in decreased concentrations of CO and NO2, whereas O3 concentrations increased. While CO and NO2 concentrations were influenced by road traffic and the surrounding urban environment, those of O3 and PM2.5 were affected by long-range transport. High concentrations of CO, NO2, SO2, and PM2.5 were observed during periods of atmospheric stagnation. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the relationships among winter air pollutant concentrations, photochemical reactions, atmospheric stagnation, and long-range transport."

We use a set of model simulations that realistically simulate QBO and a novel ozone diagnostic tool to separate temperature- and circulation-driven QBO impacts. These are important for diagnosing model–model differences in QBO–ozone responses for climate projections. 
 The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) in tropical winds perturbs stratospheric ozone throughout much of the atmosphere via changes in transport of ozone and other trace gases, as well as via temperature changes, both of which alter ozone chemistry. Attributing these causes of  QBO–ozone variability may provide insights into model-to-model differences that contribute to ozone simulation. Here we develop a novel metric of steady-state ozone (SSO) to separate these effects: SSO calculates the local steady-state response of ozone due to the changes in temperature, chemical species, and overhead ozone column; the response due to circulation change is presumed when SSO shows no response. It is applied to the nudged Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 2 (E3SMv2) with interactive ozone chemistry to demonstrate its validity. The E3SMv2 simulations nudged to reanalysis data produced reasonable wind and ozone patterns, especially in the tropics. Consistent with previous studies, we find clear demarcations with pressure. Ozone perturbations in the upper stratosphere (<6 hPa) are predicted by temperature changes; those between 6 and 20 hPa are predicted by NOy changes, and those in the lower stratosphere show no temperature or NOy response and are presumably driven by circulation changes. These results are important for diagnosing model-to-model discrepancy in QBO–ozone response and enhancing the reliability of ozone projections."

We modified the GEOS-Chem model to simulate the climate change by LACs based on a local emission inventory and explored the impacts of LAC properties and atmospheric variables on the corresponding direct radiative forcings (DRFs) in seven regions of China. The study confirms the warming effect of LACs and deepens our knowledge of their climatic effects. 
 Black carbon (BC) and brown carbon (BrC) are the dominant light-absorbing carbonaceous aerosols (LACs) that contribute significantly to climate change through absorbing and scattering radiation. We used GEOS-Chem integrated with the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for General Circulation Models to estimate LAC properties and direct radiative forcings (DRFs) in China. Primary BrC (Pri-BrC) and secondary BrC (Sec-BrC) were separated from organic carbon and modeled as independent tracers. LAC Chinese anthropogenic emissions and refractive indexes were updated. Additionally, we investigated the impacts of LAC properties and atmospheric variables on LAC DRFs based on principal component analysis. It was shown that BC exerts a warming effect at the top of the atmosphere, while Pri-BrC and Sec-BrC induce a cooling effect. At the surface, they collectively lead to surface cooling, whereas within the atmosphere, they all can contribute to atmospheric heating, with 1.848 ± 1.098, 0.146 ± 0.079 and 0.022 ± 0.008 W m−2, respectively. The atmospheric shortwave DRFs of BC and Pri-BrC were proportional to their corresponding concentrations, aerosol optical depth (AOD) and absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD), and they were inversely proportional to the single scattering albedo, surface albedo and ozone concentration in most regions. The surface longwave DRFs for the LACs showed negative correlations with water vapor in most areas. The highest atmospheric warming effect of LACs was observed in Central China, followed by East China, owing to the high LAC concentrations, AOD and AAOD as well as the low surface albedo and ozone concentration. This study enhances our understanding of the climatic impacts of LACs."

To address these challenges, urgent global action is needed to monitor the distribution of trace gases and understand their effects on the atmosphere. 
 We examine the variability of diurnal tide (DT), semidiurnal tide (SDT), and terdiurnal tide (TDT) amplitudes in the Arctic mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) during and after sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events using meteor radar data at three polar-latitude stations, Sodankylä (67.37° N, 26.63° E), Tromsø (69.58° N, 19.22° E), and Svalbard (78.99° N, 15.99° E), as well as one station outside the polar vortex located at Collm (51.3° N, 13° E). By combining tidal amplitude anomalies with trace gas variations, induced by large-scale dynamical changes caused by the breaking of planetary waves, this study provides new observational insights into the variation of ozone and water vapor, transport, and tides at polar latitudes. We use short-wave (QRS) and long-wave (QRL) radiative heating and cooling rates simulated by the WACCM-X(SD) model to investigate the roles of polar ozone and water vapor in driving mesospheric tidal variability during SSWs in the polar regions. Our analysis reveals distinct tidal responses during SSW events. At the onset of SSWs, a significant negative anomaly in TDT amplitudes in zonal and meridional components is observed, with a decrease of 3 m s−1, approximately 25 % change compared to the mean TDT amplitude. Meanwhile, SDT shows a positive anomaly of 10 m s−1, with changes reaching up to 40 %, indicating an enhancement of tidal amplitude in both components. The DT amplitude exhibits a delayed enhancement, with a positive amplitude anomaly of up to 5 m s−1 in the meridional wind component, occurring approximately 20 d after the onset of SSWs. A similar but weaker effect is observed in the zonal wind component, with changes reaching up to 30 % in the zonal component and 50 % in the meridional wind component. We analyzed the contributions of ozone and water vapor to the short-wave heating and long-wave cooling before, during, and after the onset of SSW events. Our findings suggest that the immediate responses of SDT are most likely driven by dynamical effects accompanied by the radiative effects from ozone. Radiative forcing change during SSW likely plays a secondary role in DT changes but appears to be important 20 d after the event, particularly during the spring transition. Water vapor acts as a dynamical tracer in the stratosphere and mesosphere but has minimal radiative forcing, resulting in a negligible impact on tidal changes. This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of mesospheric tidal variability in polar regions during sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs), examining and linking the significant role of trace gases and radiative effects in modulating tidal dynamics."

Results highlight the need to understand the variability in aerosol optical properties for accurate monitoring and health and environmental impact assessments. 
 This study investigates the optical properties and variability of the mass absorption coefficient (MAC) of carbonaceous aerosols produced by the combustion of different fuels. Emissions were also characterized in terms of particle size distribution and concentrations of elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC). Experiments were conducted in an atmospheric simulation chamber with a soot generator fueled with propane and a commercial diesel engine running on regular diesel and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO). Different methods of sampling and analyzing carbonaceous aerosols were evaluated, focusing on workplace environments. The EC : TC (total carbon) ratios were found to be 0.7 ± 0.1 for propane, 0.15 ± 0.05 for diesel, and 0.4 ± 0.2 for HVO, indicating a higher proportion of OC in the diesel and HVO samples. Fresh soot particles showed monomodal log-normal distributions with peaks varying based on the fuel type and combustion process, with propane particles exhibiting a peak at larger particle sizes compared to HVO and diesel. The optical properties revealed that the MAC values varied across different fuel exhausts. Diesel combustion produced more light-absorbing particles compared to propane and HVO, with MAC values measured between 870 and 635 nm ranging from 6.2 ± 0.5 to 9.4 ± 0.4 m2 g−1 for commercial diesel, 5.2 ± 0.5 to 7.8 ± 1.1 m2 g−1 for propane, and 5.8 ± 0.2 to 8.4 ± 0.6 m2 g−1 for HVO."

Here we propose a novel way to retrieve MABL specific humidity profiles using the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) Level-1 signal-to-noise ratio. Using a machine learning approach, we successfully obtained a retrieval product that outperforms the ERA-5 reanalysis and operational Level-2 retrievals globally, except in the deep tropics. 
 Marine atmosphere boundary layer (MABL) water vapor amount and gradient impact global energy transport through directly affecting the sensible and latent heat exchange between the ocean and atmosphere. Yet, it is a well-known challenge for satellite remote sensing to profile MABL water vapor, especially when cloud or a sharp vertical gradient of water vapor is present. Wu et al. (2022) identified good correlations between the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) deep refraction signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) value and the global MABL water vapor specific humidity when the radio occultation (RO) signal is ducted by the moist planetary boundary layer (PBL), and they laid out the underlying physical mechanisms to explain such a correlation. In this work, we apply a machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) technique to demonstrate the feasibility of profile-by-profile MABL water vapor retrieval using the SNR signal. Three convolutional neural network (CNN) models are trained using multi-months of global collocated hourly ERA-5 reanalysis and COSMIC-1, Metop-A, and Metop-B 1 Hz SNR observations between 975–850 hPa with 25 hPa vertical resolution. The COSMIC-1 ML model is then applied to both COSMIC-1 and COSMIC-2 in other time ranges for independent retrieval and validation. The Monte Carlo Dropout method was employed for the uncertainty estimation. Comparison against multiple field campaign radiosonde/dropsonde observations globally suggests that SNR-ML-method-retrieved water vapor consistently outperforms the wetPrf/wetPf2 standard retrieval product at all six pressure levels between 975 and 850 hPa and either outperforms or achieves similar performance against ERA-5, indicating real and useful information is gained from the SNR signal, though training was performed against the reanalysis. The climatology and diurnal cycle of MABL structure constructed from the SNR-ML technique are studied and compared to the reanalysis. Disparities of climatology suggest ERA-5 may systematically produce dry biases at high latitudes and wet biases in marine stratocumulus regions. The diurnal cycle amplitudes are too weak and sometimes off phase in ERA-5, especially in the Arctic and stratocumulus regions. These areas are particularly prone to PBL processes, where this GNSS SNR-ML water vapor product may contribute the most."

The absorption of solar energy by aerosols induces warming, altering the cloud dynamics. We developed an approach that combines polarimeter and lidar to quantify this. This methodology is assessed during the AEROCLO-sA (AErosol RadiatiOn and CLOud in Southern Africa) campaign. To validate it, we used irradiance measurements acquired during aircraft spiral descents. A major perspective is the generalization of this method to the global level. 
 Aerosols have important effects on both local and global climate, as well as on clouds and precipitations. We present original results derived from the airborne observations acquired from the AErosol RadiatiOn and CLOud in Southern Africa (AEROCLO-sA) field campaign led in Namibia in August and September 2017. In order to quantify the aerosols' radiative impact on the Namibian regional radiative budget, we use an innovative approach that combines the OSIRIS polarimeter, an airborne prototype of the future 3MI polarimeter of ESA, and lidar data to derive the heating rate of the aerosols. To calculate this parameter we use a radiative transfer code, meteorological parameters provided by dropsondes, and OSIRIS-retrieved aerosol optical thickness, size, and absorption above clouds. This approach is evaluated during massive transports of biomass-burning particles above clouds. We present vertical profiles of heating rates computed in the solar and thermal parts of the spectrum. Our results indicate strong positive heating rate values retrieved above clouds due to aerosols, between +2 and +5 K per day (vertically averaged). Within the smoke layer, water vapor's cooling effect through infrared radiation generally balances its warming effect from solar radiation. At the top of the layer, a stronger cooling effect of −1.5 K d−1  often dominates due to water vapor. In order to validate this methodology, we use irradiance measurements acquired by aircraft during spiral descent during dedicated parts of their flights, which provides direct measurements of irradiance distribution and heating rates as functions of the altitude. Despite the challenges posed by cloud horizontal variability observed during the spiral descent, simulated and measured results generally agree in most cases. Finally, we discuss the possibility of applying this method to available and future spaceborne passive and active sensors."

 This paper presents an extension of the original Local Fraction methodology to allow  the tracking of the sensitivity of chemically active air pollutants to emission sources. The generalized Local Fractions are defined as the linear sensitivities of chemical species to source emission changes, as propagated through the full set of non-linear chemical transformations. The method allows us to simultaneously track sensitivities from hundreds of sources (typically countries or emission sectors) in a single simulation. The current work describes how the non-linear chemical transformations are taken into account in a rigorous manner while validating the implementation of the method in the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) Meteorological Synthesizing Centre – West (MSC-W) chemistry-transport model by examples. While effectively producing the same results as a direct “brute-force” method, where the impact of emission reductions in each source has to be computed in a separate scenario simulation, the generalized Local Fractions are an order of magnitude more computationally efficient when large numbers of scenarios are considered."

Levoglucosan (LEVO) is a widely used tracer for BB, but its oxidative decay is still less understood. While gas-phase hydroxyl radicals (•OH) have been considered the primary oxidants for LEVO decay in biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA) particles, high particulate viscosity at low relative humidity (RH) limits •OH uptake. In this study, we demonstrate a less recognized  pathway that leads to LEVO degradation in BBOA particles under light, which is primarily driven by triplet excited states (3BBOA*) via hydrogen transfer in photosensitization reactions. Unlike •OH oxidation that relies on mass transfer of oxidants from the gas phase, 3BBOA* oxidation remains effective in viscous particles at low RH and accounts for ∼50% of LEVO decay, shortening its chemical lifetime in previous estimates by a half  to ∼1.8 days. These findings highlight the importance of processes that generate oxidants within particles, such as photosensitization, and enhance our understanding of the atmospheric fate of LEVO to facilitate BB tracking."

 Satellite-based fine-resolution (∼100 m) PM2.5 mapping remains challenging because broadband multispectral imagery struggles to decouple land and atmospheric signals, limiting accurate local emission source detection in regions with sparse ground monitoring networks. Here, we introduce LAD-GAT, a novel deep learning framework for 100 m-resolution PM2.5 estimation from SDGSAT-1––the first science satellite mission dedicated to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Specifically, LAD-GAT builds a high-dimensional scene-attribute graph by combining PM2.5-relevant geographical features, meteorological dynamics, top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, and estimated surface reflectance (SR). A specialized land-atmosphere decoupling (LAD) module is introduced to separate latent aerosol signals from ground surface contributions, and a graph attention network (GAT) models nonlinear associations between in-situ PM2.5 observations and the input graph structure. In 10-fold cross-validation, LAD-GAT achieved RMSE = 5.042 μg m−3 (R2 = 0.875) using SDGSAT-1 TOA reflectance, and RMSE = 9.428 μg m−3 (R2 = 0.862) with Sentinel-2 TOA reflectance. Incorporating daily SR yielded an 8.68 % accuracy gain over TOA reflectance alone and outperformed multi-day composites by 7.27 %, highlighting the benefit of accounting for SR dynamics in fine-scale PM2.5 mapping. Overall, leveraging the proposed novel LAD-GAT method, SDGSAT-derived PM2.5 estimates rival those from Sentinel-2, providing fine-scale data to better support SDG 11.6.2 monitoring and targeted air-quality interventions."

 Accurately predicting particulate matter is crucial for preventing health risks and protecting public health. This study improves the accuracy of particulate matter d≤10μm (PM10 ) forecasts over Morocco for the next five days using a U-Net-based deep learning model, marking the first work of its kind in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The U-Net model was used to post-process and improve PM10 forecasts from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), with reanalysis data from CAMS serving as a reference to guide the model's learning. The U-Net architecture was modified to predict outputs at a resolution different from the inputs, eliminating the need for interpolation and preserving critical spatial details. The results demonstrated significant improvements over two baselines—CAMS forecasts and the Analog Ensemble model (AnEn)—by enhancing metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Coefficient of Determination (R2), Index of Agreement (IOA), and biases, particularly in regions prone to dust storms, during the period prior to the CAMS forecast upgrade in mid-2023. In the second half of 2023, U-Net continued to improve predictions; however, the effect of the upgrade cycle became evident in its errors. This highlights the importance of retraining U-Net with updated data as it becomes available to maintain its reliability in operational forecasting systems. U-Net also proved effective in capturing particulate pollution, providing reliable predictions for values up to 500 μg/m3. These findings underscore U-Net's potential for operational forecasting, supporting accurate early warnings to mitigate the health and environmental impacts of PM10  pollution."

 Accurate, long-term records of atmospheric CO2 concentrations are crucial for understanding carbon cycle dynamics and evaluating the impacts of natural and anthropogenic emissions. In this study, we present a global dataset of column-averaged CO2 concentrations (XCO2) covering the period 2003–2022, generated using an enhanced version of the XCO2SAT+ method. This approach integrates satellite observations from four missions (ENVISAT, GOSAT, GOSAT, GOSAT-2 and OCO-2) harmonized through the EMMA v4.5 product, and applies a novel spatio-temporal interpolation algorithm to estimate monthly mean XCO2 values at 23 958 locations worldwide (≈95 km grid spacing). The dataset provides XCO2 estimates over global land surfaces and adjacent coastal regions. Validation against 28 TCCON sites yielded a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.76ppm, comparable to NOAA’s CarbonTracker model (MAE=0.71ppm). The method reliably reconstructs XCO2 time series even in regions with sparse satellite coverage, while preserving spatial and seasonal variability. As a demonstration, we identify XCO2 anomalies linked to major wildfire events, including North American mega-fires in 2018 and recurring fire activity in tropical northern Africa, with localized monthly anomalies exceeding 2 ppm–4 ppm. Comparison with recent machine learning (ML) products confirms that the XCO2SAT+ method achieves higher accuracy across multiple TCCON sites and time frames. This semi-empirical dataset provides a valuable alternative to assimilation-based models, supporting climate research, emission monitoring, and the detection of CO2 perturbations from extreme events at high spatial and temporal resolution."

Much of our knowledge about SSA derives from coastal observations near shorelines, but whether and when these observations accurately represent open oceans remain unclear. Here, we show that strong nearshore SSA production during high-wave periods greatly enhances downwind cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and aerosol mass concentrations. Strong shoreline wave breaking is widespread globally, and swell waves, which are decoupled from local winds, play a dominant role in many coastal regions. Therefore, extrapolating results based on coastal measurements to open oceans may significantly overestimate SSA concentration and its contribution to CCN and, by extension, the impact of SSA on clouds and climate. Additionally, the strong enhancement of coastal aerosol population by shoreline wave breaking and its environmental impact on coastal communities cannot be captured by current regional models, which do not parameterize nearshore SSA generation using wave energy or completely neglect it."
