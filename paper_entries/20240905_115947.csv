However, the economic impact of air pollution has rarely been explored. Here, we examined the impact of exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) derived from satellite data at 1 km × 1 km resolution on the productivity of the manufacturing plants using a micro-level dataset for the period 2008–2009 and 2009–2010 across 465 districts in India. Using a system generalized methods of moments techniques, we estimated that for every 10% increase in PM2.5 exposure, labor productivity decreases by 14.8% after controlling for the confounding factors. For exposure exceeding the national ambient air quality standard of annual PM2.5 in India (40 μg m−3), the labor productivity decreases by a bigger margin (20%) for the same margin of increase in PM2.5. We found that labor productivity loss due to ambient air pollution was lower for plants using capital-intensive production techniques. The labor productivity in plants with a higher share of blue-collar workers was more sensitive to exposure to PM2.5 as opposed to plants with a higher share of supervisors or managerial staff. This suggests that plant-level managerial skill and capital-intensive production techniques (including expenditure on pollution control and abatement equipment) will be critical in mitigating air pollution-induced labor productivity loss across manufacturing plants in India."

We assess how well CMIP6 climate models capture this radiative heating by clouds within the atmosphere. While we find large differences among models, especially in cold regions of the atmosphere with abundant ice clouds, we also demonstrate that physical understanding allows us to predict the response of clouds and their radiative heating near the tropopause to climate change. 
 Cloud–radiation interactions are key to Earth's climate and its  susceptibility to change. While their impact on Earth's energy budget has been studied in great detail, their effect on atmospheric temperatures has received little attention, despite its importance for the planetary circulation of the atmosphere and hence for regional climate and weather. Here, we present the first systematic assessment of vertically resolved cloud-radiative heating within the atmosphere in 20 CMIP6 (phase 6 of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project) models, including a comparison to satellite-based estimates. Our analysis highlights model differences in cloud-radiative heating in both the lower and upper troposphere as well as uncertainties related to cloud ice processes. It also illustrates limitations of our ability to observe cloud-radiative heating. Not surprisingly, the response of cloud-radiative heating to surface warming is also uncertain across models. Yet, in the upper troposphere, the response is very well predicted by an upward shift of the present-day heating, which we show results from the fact that cloud-radiative heating in the upper troposphere is a function of air temperature and thus decoupled from surface temperature. Our results have three important implications for upper-tropospheric cloud-radiative heating: they establish a new null hypothesis for its response to warming, offer a physics-based prediction of its response to warming based on present-day observations, and emphasize the need for improving its representation in simulations of the present-day climate, possibly by combining the benefits of upcoming km-scale models and satellite observations."

Lee,A new aerial approach for quantifying and attributing methane emissions: implementation and validation,"Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas originating from both natural and human activities. We describe a new uncrewed aerial system (UAS) designed to measure methane emission rates over a wide range of scales. This system has been used for direct quantification of point sources and distributed emitters over scales of up to 1 km. The system uses simultaneous measurements of methane and ethane to distinguish between different kinds of natural and human-related emission sources. 
 Methane (CH4) is a powerful greenhouse gas that is produced by a diverse set of natural and anthropogenic emission sources. Biogenic methane sources generally involve anaerobic decay processes such as those occurring in wetlands, melting permafrost, or the digestion of organic matter in the guts of ruminant animals. Thermogenic CH4 sources originate from the breakdown of organic material at high temperatures and pressure within the Earth's crust, a process which also produces more complex trace hydrocarbons such as ethane (C2H6). Here, we present the development and deployment of an uncrewed aerial system (UAS) that employs a fast (1 Hz) and sensitive (1–0.5 ppb s−1) CH4 and  C2H6 sensor and ultrasonic anemometer. The UAS platform is a vertical-takeoff, hexarotor drone (DJI Matrice 600 Pro, M600P) capable of vertical profiling to 120 m altitude and plume sampling across scales up to 1 km. Simultaneous measurements of CH4 and C2H6 concentrations, vector winds, and positional data allow for source classification (biogenic versus thermogenic), differentiation, and emission rates without the need for modeling or a priori assumptions about winds, vertical mixing, or other environmental conditions. The system has been used for direct quantification of methane point sources, such as orphan wells, and distributed emitters,  such as landfills and wastewater treatment facilities. With detectable source rates as low as 0.04 and up to ∼ 1500 kg h−1, this UAS offers a direct and repeatable method of horizontal and vertical profiling of emission plumes at scales that are complementary to regional aerial surveys and localized ground-based monitoring."

Typically, pure water cloud droplets stay liquid until around -35 °C, unless they come into contact with ice-nucleating particles (INPs). INPs are a rare subset of aerosol particles. Using uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), it is possible to collect aerosol particles and analyse them on their ice-nucleating ability. This study describes the test and validation of a sampling setup that can be used to collect aerosol particles onto a filter. 
 A mobile sampler for the collection of aerosol particles on an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) was developed and deployed during three consecutive Pallas Cloud Experiment campaigns in the vicinity of the Sammaltunturi Global Atmosphere Watch site (67°58’ N, 24°7’ E, 565 m above sea level). The sampler is designed to collect aerosol particles onto Nuclepore filters, which are subsequently analysed for the temperature-dependent number concentration of ice-nucleating particles of the sampled aerosol with the Ice Nucleation Spectrometer of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (INSEKT). This setup is an easy and flexible way to connect INP concentration measurements with cloud microphysics. The sampler was flown with a fixed-wing UAV in different altitudes up to 1000 m above ground level. The total flight time ranges from 1 hour to more than 1.5 hours, depending on environmental conditions. Pressure, temperature and relative humidity are also measured to provide information about the meteorological flight conditions. The flow over the filter was maintained by a micro-diaphragm pump, providing around 10 standard litres per minute over a small filter (diameter of 25 mm) and around 11 standard litres per minute over a larger filter (diameter of 47 mm) at a pressure corresponding to 500 m above sea level. For a typical flight time of 1.5 hours, this results in a sampled air volume of about 930 to 1000 standard litres per flight, giving an INP detection limit of approximately 1.1 × 10−3 and 1.0 × 10−3 INPs per standard litre, respectively. For comparison to the flight results, a similar setup was deployed at ground level. The comparison shows a clear distinction from the water and handling blank background for both setups, proving the technical feasibility of the setups. Furthermore, for some flights, a shift between the two INP populations can be seen, indicating that ground-based INP measurements deviate from the samples collected on-board the UAV."

It is applied to the Météo-France global numerical weather prediction model, with the objective of simulating Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar reflectivity observations. Additionally, the simulation of the bright-band is addressed, and then successfully applied to model forecasts for the purpose of classifying the model columns between stratiform and convective categories. 
 Because of their high sensitivity to hydrometeors and their high vertical resolutions, space-borne radar observations are emerging as an undeniable asset for Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) applications. The EUMETSAT (European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites) NWP SAF (Satellite Application Facility) released an active sensor module within version 13 of the RTTOV (Radiative Transfer for TOVS) software with the goal of simulating both active and passive microwave instruments within a single framework using the same radiative transfer assumptions. This study provides an in-depth description of the radar simulator available within this software. In addition, this study proposes a revised version of the existing melting layer parametrization scheme of Bauer (2001) within the RTTOV-SCATT v13.1 model to provide a better fit to observations below the freezing level. Simulations are performed with and without melting layer schemes for the Dual precipitation radar (DPR) instrument onboard GPM using the ARPEGE (Action de Recherche Petite Echelle Grande Echelle) global NWP model running operationally at Météo-France for two different one-month periods (June, 2020 and January, 2021). Results for a case study over the Atlantic ocean show that the revised melting scheme produces more realistic simulations as compared to the default scheme both at Ku (13.5 GHz) and Ka (35.5 GHz) frequencies and these simulations are much closer to observations. A statistical assessment using more samples show significant improvement of the first-guess departure statistics with the revised scheme compared to the existing melting scheme. As a step further, this study showcases the use of melting layer simulations for the classification of precipitation (stratiform, convective and transition) using the Dual Frequency Ratio algorithm (DFR). The classification results also reveal a significant overestimation of the rain reflectivities in all hemispheres, which can either be due to a tendency of the ARPEGE model to produce a too large amount of convective precipitation, or to a mis-representation of the convective precipitation fraction within the forward operator."

We propose a framework to assess model performance. In the framework, convective cells are identified and tracked in the forecasts and observations, and then the model skill is evaluated by comparing differences between forecast and observed cells. We demonstrate the framework with 4 open-source models. 
 The rapid temporal evolution of convective rainfall poses a challenge for rainfall nowcasting models. With the growing potential of machine learning models for precipitation nowcasting to produce realistic-looking nowcasts for long lead times, it is important to investigate whether the nowcasts also produce realistic development for convective rainfall. Common verification metrics traditionally used to validate nowcasting models are often dominated by large-scale stratiform rainfall, and averaging the metrics across entire precipitation fields obscures how accurately the models replicate individual convective cells, which makes it difficult to distinguish the model skill for the growth and decay of convective rainfall. In this study, we present a convective cell tracking-based framework to investigate how accurately nowcasting models reproduce the development of convective rainfall. The framework consists of first identifying and tracking the convective cells in the input observation rainfall fields, and then identifying and tracking the cells separately in the target observations and the nowcast rainfall fields by continuing the cell tracks identified in the observations. Features describing the cells and cell tracks, such as the cell volume rain rate and area, are then extracted. In addition to the errors in these feature values, the models’ skill in reproducing the existence of convective cells is estimated by calculating several contingency-table metrics, such as the Critical Success Index. The results allow the analysis of how accurately the models reproduce the growth and decay of convective rainfall and quantify the differences between the models, for example, due to differences in how the models smooth the nowcasts, i.e., blurring. The framework also allows differentiation of the results based on the initial conditions of the cell tracks, demonstrated here by separating the tracks into decaying or growing cell tracks based on the cell status when the nowcast is created. The framework is demonstrated using four open-source advection-based models: the advection nowcast, S-PROG, and LINDA implemented in the pysteps library, and L-CNN, with data from the Swiss radar network. The results indicate that the L-CNN model reproduced the existence of convective cells best among the models and had smaller errors in the cell volume rain rate than LINDA and S-PROG. LINDA had the smallest underestimation in the cell mean rain rate, whereas S-PROG significantly overestimated the cell volume rain rate and area because of blurring."

Vikesland;Amy Pruden,Metagenomic Profiling of Internationally Sourced Sewage Influents and Effluents Yields Insight into Selecting Targets for Antibiotic Resistance Monitoring,"It has been debated whether wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) primarily act to attenuate or amplify antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, ARGs are highly diverse with respect to their resistance mechanisms, mobilities, and taxonomic hosts and therefore their behavior in WWTPs should not be expected to be universally conserved. We applied metagenomic sequencing to wastewater influent and effluent samples from 12 international WWTPs to classify the behavior of specific ARGs entering and exiting WWTPs. In total, 1079 different ARGs originating from a variety of bacteria were detected. This included ARGs that could be mapped to assembled scaffolds corresponding to nine human pathogens. While the relative abundance (per 16S rRNA gene) of ARGs decreased during treatment at 11 of the 12 WWTPs sampled and absolute abundance (per mL) decreased at all 12 WWTPs, increases in relative abundance were observed for 40% of the ARGs detected at the 12th WWTP. Also, the relative abundance of mobile genetic elements (MGE) increased during treatment, but the fraction of ARGs known to be transmissible between species decreased, thus demonstrating that increased MGE prevalence may not be generally indicative of an increase in ARGs. A distinct conserved resistome was documented in both influent and effluent across samples, suggesting that well-functioning WWTPs generally attenuate influent antibiotic resistance loads. This work helps inform strategies for wastewater surveillance of antibiotic resistance, highlighting the utility of tracking ARGs as indicators of treatment performance and relative risk reduction."

The lack of understanding regarding the mechanism behind fluoride-induced irreversible interface reconstruction hinders their practical application in large-scale energy-saving and pollution-reduction efforts. Here, we conducted multidimensional operando investigations to gain insights into the dynamic evolution across the film electrode interface with temporal and spatial resolution. Our findings reveal that electroosmosis of F– initially triggers structural collapse and subsequent reconstruction of [MnO6] units, followed by interaction with the spontaneous oxide film at the surface of lead substrate. Experimental studies and theoretical calculations indicate that F– facilitates the irreversible transformation of γ-MnO2 into more stable yet protective catalytic dual-defective α-MnO2. Additionally, lower levels of F– at the interface promote a change in microenvironmental pH within porous PbSO4, triggering the development of microporous corrosion-resistant β-PbO2 as the dominant phase. The combined effects of MnO2 and interphase evolution effectively explain the abnormally elevated oxygen evolution overpotential. Then, the proposed appropriate application scenarios based on the corrosion behavior will serve as a practical guide for the implementation of the hierarchical manganese dioxide film electrode."

The IBU@CNT-EM can generate H2O2 at a rate of 25.62 mol gCNT–1 h–1 L–1 in the permeate with a residence time of 1.81 s. We demonstrated that an interwoven, hydrophilic–hydrophobic membrane nanostructure offers an excellent air-to-water transport platform for ORR acceleration. The electron transfer number of the ORR for IBU@CNT at neutral pH was confirmed as 2.71, elucidating a near-2e selectivity to H2O2. Density functional theory (DFT) studies validated an exceptional charge distribution of the IBU@CNT for the O2 adsorption. The adsorption energies of the O2 and *OOH intermediates are proportional to the H2O2 selectivity (64.39%), higher than that of the CNT (37.81%).

After the tagging, candidates of quinones in representative aqueous environmental samples (water extractions of biochar) were identified through high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) analysis. The MS and UV spectra analysis showed rapid reactions between Cys/CCP and model quinones with β-carbon from the same benzene ring available for Michael addition.

Deletion of the 22 C-terminal amino acids of ArsI increased its demethylation activity while reducing the oxidation activity. Further deletion of 44 C-terminal residues enhanced the MAs(III) demethylation activity. ArsI has four vicinal cysteine pairs, with the first pair being necessary for MAs(III) demethylation, while at least one of the other three pairs contributes to MAs(III) oxidation. Molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis indicated that one of the C-terminal vicinal cysteine pairs is involved in modulating the switch between oxidase and demethylase activity.

Stapleton,Silicone Wristbands as a Personal Passive Sampler to Evaluate Indoor Exposure to Volatile and Non-volatile PFASs,"Exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) primarily occurs via consumption of contaminated drinking water and food; however, individuals can also be exposed dermally and via inhalation indoors. This study developed an analytical method for measuring volatile PFASs in silicone wristbands and used them to assess personal exposure in a Midwestern community (n = 87). Paired samples of blood and wristbands were analyzed for PFASs using LC–MS/MS and GC-HRMS to monitor both non-volatile and volatile PFASs. The most frequently detected PFASs in wristbands were: 6:2 diPAP, 6:2 FTOH, MeFOSE and EtFOSE. Females had a 4-fold higher exposure to 6:2 diPAP compared to males and age-dependent differences in exposure to 6:2 FTOH, MeFOSE and EtFOSE were observed. Exposure to MeFOSE and EtFOSE differed based on the average time spent in the home. Frequently detected PFASs in blood were: PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFHpS, and N-MeFOSAA. A strong correlation was found between MeFOSE in the wristbands and N-MeFOSAA in serum (rs = 0.90, p-value <0.001), suggesting exposure to this PFAS was primarily via inhalation and dermal exposure. These results demonstrate that wristbands can provide individual level data on exposure to some polyfluoroalkyl precursors present indoors that reflect serum levels of their suspected biotransformation products."

Their impact on puberty in boys is unclear. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the association between PFAS exposure and pubertal timing in 300 Norwegian boys (9–16 years), enrolled in the Bergen Growth Study 2 during 2016. We measured 19 PFAS in serum samples and used objective pubertal markers, including ultrasound-measured testicular volume (USTV), Tanner staging of pubic hair development, and serum levels of testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone. In addition to logistic regression of single pollutants and the sum of PFAS, Bayesian and elastic net regression were used to estimate the contribution of the individual PFAS. Higher levels of the sum of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) were associated with later pubertal onset according to USTV (age-adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.20, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.29, 3.93) and testosterone level (AOR: 2.35, 95% CI: 1.34, 4.36). Bayesian modeling showed that higher levels of PFNA and PFHxS were associated with later pubertal onset by USTV, while higher levels of PFNA and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA) were associated with later pubertal onset by testosterone level. Our findings indicate that certain PFAS were associated with delay in male pubertal onset."

Human respiratory deposition dose assessments of particles with varying chemical compositions were further conducted by a respiratory deposition model. The results showed that during our observation, particles containing elemental carbon (EC) were the dominant components in UFPs (0.05–0.1 μm). Compared to fine and coarse particles, UFPs can deposit more deeply into the respiratory tract with a daily dose of ∼2.08 ± 0.67 billion particles. Among the deposited UFPs, EC-cluster particles constituted ∼85.7% in number fraction, accounting for a daily number dose of ∼1.78 billion particles, which poses a greater impact on human health.

Oxidation of certain fluorinated gases in the atmosphere is considered the primary source of TFA in the terrestrial environment, and the combined change in gas type and increased usage would therefore expectedly lead to an increased TFA burden over the last few decades. Here, we show that the concentration of TFA in 113 Danish groundwater monitoring wells is strongly correlated to the groundwater recharge year, as derived from the tritium-helium dating method. TFA was not detected in tritium-free groundwater recharged before 1960, while it was detected at low concentrations in most samples recharged between 1960 and 1980. Groundwater recharged after 1980 had at least 0.1 μg/L TFA, and the concentration increased with time. Shallow groundwater from natural “background” areas revealed some variation of TFA even with diffuse atmospheric deposition as the only source, but additional local sources must contribute TFA to some of the monitoring wells. As an important side aspect, TFA may prove very useful as a simple indicator of groundwater age, such as the presence of young water in a groundwater abstraction well."

Measurement of SOA fingerprints is vitally important in revealing precursor interactions in mixed systems. In this work, anthropogenic (naphthalene (Nap) and 2-methyl naphthalene (2-MN)) and biogenic (α-pinene (Alp)) precursors and their mixture are OH-oxidized in a chamber to investigate the interaction of precursors on SOA formation. Organics formed from the single and mixed precursor systems are analyzed by using a thermal desorption comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography–mass spectrometer (TD-GC×GC-MS). A pixel-based nontargeted analysis technique is deployed to resolve the mass spectra. Nearly 70% of the total response is resolved at the molecular level. The “full spectrum” template is then applied to identify SOA markers with the combination of enhancement ratios of blob quantifier responses. We found that all SOA markers in mixed systems are related to Alp, including 8-hydroxycarvotanacetone, and 5-isopropenyl-2-methyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2-ol. SOA markers of Nap and 2-MN are suppressed in mixed systems, indicating the complexity of the SOA formation mechanism under mixed-precursor conditions.

This study demonstrates that the frequency of extreme events are linked to the phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole mode. The temporal changes in the occurrence frequency of extremes are simulated in an eddy‐resolving ocean model consistently with observations. However, a non‐eddying model significantly underestimate the occurrence frequency of extreme sea level events, suggesting the importance of coastal trapped wave propagations regulated by the horizontal scale with the Rossby radius of deformation.

We address these gaps with a high resolution (1/12°) ensemble of dynamically downscaled decadal predictions. The downscaled simulations accurately predicted past oceanic variability at scales relevant to marine resource management, with skill typically exceeding global coarse‐resolution predictions. Over the long term, warming of the Shelf is projected to continue; however, we forecast a temporary warming pause in the next decade. This predicted pause is attributed to internal variability associated with a transient, moderate strengthening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and a southward shift of the Gulf Stream."

This study investigates this asymmetry to elucidate the recently observed phenomenon of flux separation in the pitch angle distribution during drift echo events. The asymmetry in Shabansky orbits between the northern and southern hemispheres leads to two distinct drift periods for particles with specific equatorial pitch angles, resulting in the flux separation. To quantify this phenomenon, we develop a mathematical model for the magnetic field, enabling the generation of asymmetrical Shabansky orbits. The calculated drift periods for particles with different equatorial pitch angles corresponds with the characteristics of flux separation, providing evidence to support our hypothesis that the north‐south asymmetry of Shabansky orbits is responsible for flux separation."

According to the location of DongFangHong III, we divided our cruise into five regions: Qingdao port (QD), Zhoushan port (ZS), Bohai Sea (BHS), Yellow Sea (YS), and East China Sea (ECS).

Contributions of these five factors varied depending on the location, influenced by emission, atmospheric oxidation, and meteorological conditions. In addition, the inland anthropogenic sources were found to have a larger contribution than oceanic ones.

At present, the feedback mechanism of latent heating on the persistent eastward movement of SWVs under the influence of the orographic effect of the second‐step terrain in China remains unclear. Therefore, this study focused on clarifying the relationship between orographic effects and the mechanisms governing the persistent eastward movements of SWVs, as well as the feedback effect of latent heating on the eastward‐moving SWVs. In this study, it is revealed that discontinuous maintenance of closed vortex circulation occurs when eastward‐moving SWVs pass over the second‐step terrain region. Specifically, eastward‐moving SWVs first experience dissolution on the windward side, followed by substantial reconstruction of closed vortex circulation on the leeward side when passing over the second‐step terrain region. Moreover, the reconstruction of closed vortex circulation on the leeward side is closely associated with the feedback effect of latent heating, and the microphysical property of cold clouds identified during the vortex intensification determines the dual‐peak feature observed in the vertical constitution of the total latent heating, which is related to two major phase‐transition processes: the condensation of water vapor into liquid‐phase hydrometeors (LCP_vapor) process and the desublimation of water vapor into ice‐phase hydrometeors (LSP_vapor) process. From a potential vorticity (PV) perspective, latent heating promotes the genesis of PV anomalies, which accordingly facilitates the maintenance of a positive “vorticity tower” (i.e., total budget of vorticity) via the tilting effect and the horizontal advection effect of local vorticity. Further sensitivity experiments of latent heating indicated that latent heating associated with the LCP_vapor process fulfills a more important role in sustaining the positive “vorticity tower” than does that associated with the LSP_vapor process during the vortex intensification."

During the 2019–2020 Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition, joint observations of the coupled air‐ice‐ocean system were collected at multiple spatial scales. Here, we present observations of a strong mid‐winter cyclone that impacted the MOSAiC site as it drifted in the central Arctic pack ice. The sea ice dynamical response showed spatial structure at the scale of the evolving and translating cyclonic wind field. Internal ice stress and ocean stress play significant roles, resulting in timing offsets between the atmospheric forcing and the ice response and post‐cyclone inertial ringing in the ice and ocean. Ice motion in response to the wind field then forces the upper ocean currents through frictional drag. The strongest impacts to the sea ice and ocean from the passing cyclone occur as a result of the surface impacts of a strong atmospheric low‐level jet (LLJ) behind the trailing cold front and changing wind directions between the warm‐sector LLJ and post cold‐frontal LLJ. Impacts of the cyclone are prolonged through the coupled ice‐ocean inertial response. Local impacts of the approximately 120 km wide LLJ occur over a 12 hr period or less and at scales of a kilometer to a few tens of kilometers, meaning that these impacts occur at combined smaller spatial scales and faster time scales than most satellite observations and coupled Earth system models can resolve."

Our approach involves (a) a comprehensive characterization of multi‐hazards and their interrelationships in an urban setting, (b) collaborative development of relevant multi‐hazard scenarios with local disaster risk reduction (DRR) stakeholders, and (c) analysis of the potential for integrating these scenarios into urban DRR efforts. Using a critical review of 135 sources (academic and gray literature, databases, online, and social media), we identify 19 natural hazard types that might influence Nairobi and 23 in Istanbul. We further identified in Nairobi 88 and Istanbul 105 hazard interrelationship pairs (e.g., an earthquake triggering landslides) out of a possible 576 interrelationships. These findings are cataloged in an extensive database, which informs the creation of multi‐hazard risk scenario exemplars for each city. These exemplars are refined through stakeholder engagement, involving four workshops (47 participants) and nine semi‐structured interviews with local DRR stakeholders. Despite the identified benefits, this engagement reveals a significant gap in integrating multi‐hazards into current urban policy and practice. Governance challenges are highlighted as a key barrier, but opportunities for better integration are also identified, including evolving policies and growing awareness among urban actors. Our approach, particularly relevant in data‐scarce urban areas of low‐ and middle‐income countries, provides a framework for exploring multi‐hazard issues in various urban contexts."

 Hyperlipidaemia is a major risk factor of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Risk of cardiovascular events depends on cumulative lifetime exposure to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and, independently, on the time course of exposure to LDL-C, with early exposure being associated with a higher risk1. Furthermore, LDL-C fluctuations are associated with ASCVD outcomes2-4. However, the precise mechanisms behind this increased ASCVD risk are not understood. Here, we make the unexpected observation that early intermittent feeding of mice with a high-cholesterol Western-type diet (WD) accelerates atherosclerosis compared with late continuous exposure to WD, despite similar cumulative circulating LDL-C levels. We find that early intermittent hyperlipidaemia alters the number and homeostatic phenotype of resident-like arterial macrophages. Macrophage genes with altered expression are enriched for genes linked to human ASCVD in genome-wide association studies. We show that LYVE1+ resident macrophages are atheroprotective, and identify new biological pathways, related to actin filament organisation, whose alteration accelerates atherosclerosis. Using the Young Finns Study, we show that exposure to cholesterol early in life is significantly associated with the incidence and size of carotid atherosclerotic plaques in mid-adulthood. In summary, our results identify early intermittent exposure to cholesterol as a strong determinant of accelerated atherosclerosis, highlighting the importance of optimal control of hyperlipidaemia early in life, and providing insight into the underlying biological mechanisms. This knowledge will be essential to designing effective therapeutic strategies to combat atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease."

 In naive individuals, sensory neurons directly detect and respond to allergens, leading to both the sensation of itch and the activation of local innate immune cells, which initiate the allergic immune response1,2. In the setting of chronic allergic inflammation, immune factors prime sensory neurons, causing pathologic itch3–7. Although these bidirectional neuroimmune circuits drive responses to allergens, whether immune cells regulate the set-point for neuronal activation by allergens in the naive state is unknown. Here we describe a γδ T cell–IL-3 signalling axis that controls the allergen responsiveness of cutaneous sensory neurons. We define a poorly characterized epidermal γδ T cell subset8, termed GD3 cells, that produces its hallmark cytokine IL-3 to promote allergic itch and the initiation of the allergic immune response. Mechanistically, IL-3 acts on Il3ra-expressing sensory neurons in a JAK2-dependent manner to lower their threshold for allergen activation without independently eliciting itch. This γδ T cell–IL-3 signalling axis further acts by means of STAT5 to promote neuropeptide production and the initiation of allergic immunity. These results reveal an endogenous immune rheostat that sits upstream of and governs sensory neuronal responses to allergens on first exposure. This pathway may explain individual differences in allergic susceptibility and opens new therapeutic avenues for treating allergic diseases.

 Decades of neuroimaging studies have shown modest differences in brain structure and connectivity in depression, hindering mechanistic insights or the identification of risk factors for disease onset1. Furthermore, whereas depression is episodic, few longitudinal neuroimaging studies exist, limiting understanding of mechanisms that drive mood-state transitions. The emerging field of precision functional mapping has used densely sampled longitudinal neuroimaging data to show behaviourally meaningful differences in brain network topography and connectivity between and in healthy individuals2–4, but this approach has not been applied in depression. Here, using precision functional mapping and several samples of deeply sampled individuals, we found that the frontostriatal salience network is expanded nearly twofold in the cortex of most individuals with depression. This effect was replicable in several samples and caused primarily by network border shifts, with three distinct modes of encroachment occurring in different individuals. Salience network expansion was stable over time, unaffected by mood state and detectable in children before the onset of depression later in adolescence. Longitudinal analyses of individuals scanned up to 62 times over 1.5 years identified connectivity changes in frontostriatal circuits that tracked fluctuations in specific symptoms and predicted future anhedonia symptoms. Together, these findings identify a trait-like brain network topology that may confer risk for depression and mood-state-dependent connectivity changes in frontostriatal circuits that predict the emergence and remission of depressive symptoms over time. Precision functional mapping shows that the frontostriatal salience network occupies nearly twice as much of the cortex in people with depression, and this was unaffected by mood changes and detected in children before onset of symptoms."

 Negotiations for a global treaty on plastic pollution1 will shape future policies on plastics production, use and waste management. Its parties will benefit from a high-resolution baseline of waste flows and plastic emission sources to enable identification of pollution hotspots and their causes2. Nationally aggregated waste management data can be distributed to smaller scales to identify generalized points of plastic accumulation and source phenomena3–11. However, it is challenging to use this type of spatial allocation to assess the conditions under which emissions take place12,13. Here we develop a global macroplastic pollution emissions inventory by combining conceptual modelling of emission mechanisms with measurable activity data. We define emissions as materials that have moved from the managed or mismanaged system (controlled or contained state) to the unmanaged system (uncontrolled or uncontained state—the environment). Using machine learning and probabilistic material flow analysis, we identify emission hotspots across 50,702 municipalities worldwide from five land-based plastic waste emission sources. We estimate global plastic waste emissions at 52.1 [48.3–56.3] million metric tonnes (Mt) per year, with approximately 57% wt. and 43% wt. open burned and unburned debris, respectively. Littering is the largest emission source in the Global North, whereas uncollected waste is the dominant emissions source across the Global South. We suggest that our findings can help inform treaty negotiations and develop national and sub-national waste management action plans and source inventories.

Crowe,A climate threshold for ocean deoxygenation during the Early Cretaceous,"Rapid ocean deoxygenation during the Early Cretaceous OAE1a is shown to provide evidence for a strong link between volcanic CO2 emissions, weathering and ocean oxygen content that is characterized by a climate threshold. 
 Oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) are historical intervals of global-scale ocean deoxygenation associated with hyperthermal climate states and biological crises1,2. Massive volcanic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions frequently associated with these events are thought to be a common driver of ocean deoxygenation through several climate-warming-related mechanisms1,3,4. The Early Cretaceous OAE1a is one of the most intense ocean deoxygenation events, persisting for more than 1 Myr (refs. 5,6). However, existing records of marine chemistry and climate across OAE1a are insufficient to fully resolve the timing and dynamics of the underlying processes, thus obscuring cause-and-effect relationships between climate forcing and ocean oxygenation states. Here we show that rapid ocean deoxygenation during OAE1a is linked to volcanic CO2 emissions and the crossing of an associated climate threshold, after which the sluggish pace of the silicate-weathering feedback and climate recovery delayed reoxygenation for >1 Myr. At the end of OAE1a, recrossing this threshold allowed for ocean reoxygenation. Following OAE1a, however, the Earth system remained sufficiently warm such that orbitally forced climate dynamics led to continued cyclic ocean deoxygenation on approximately 100-kyr timescales for another 1 Myr. Our results thus imply a tight coupling between volcanism, weathering and ocean oxygen content that is characterized by a climate threshold.

 The adoption of agriculture triggered a rapid shift towards starch-rich diets in human populations1. Amylase genes facilitate starch digestion, and increased amylase copy number has been observed in some modern human populations with high-starch intake2, although evidence of recent selection is lacking3,4. Here, using 94 long-read haplotype-resolved assemblies and short-read data from approximately 5,600 contemporary and ancient humans, we resolve the diversity and evolutionary history of structural variation at the amylase locus. We find that amylase genes have higher copy numbers in agricultural populations than in fishing, hunting and pastoral populations. We identify 28 distinct amylase structural architectures and demonstrate that nearly identical structures have arisen recurrently on different haplotype backgrounds throughout recent human history. AMY1 and AMY2A genes each underwent multiple duplication/deletion events with mutation rates up to more than 10,000-fold the single-nucleotide polymorphism mutation rate, whereas AMY2B gene duplications share a single origin. Using a pangenome-based approach, we infer structural haplotypes across thousands of humans identifying extensively duplicated haplotypes at higher frequency in modern agricultural populations. Leveraging 533 ancient human genomes, we find that duplication-containing haplotypes (with more gene copies than the ancestral haplotype) have rapidly increased in frequency over the past 12,000 years in West Eurasians, suggestive of positive selection. Together, our study highlights the potential effects of the agricultural revolution on human genomes and the importance of structural variation in human adaptation.

 CDK1 has been known to be the sole cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) partner of cyclin B1 to drive mitotic progression1. Here we demonstrate that CDK5 is active during mitosis and is necessary for maintaining mitotic fidelity. CDK5 is an atypical CDK owing to its high expression in post-mitotic neurons and activation by non-cyclin proteins p35 and p392. Here, using independent chemical genetic approaches, we specifically abrogated CDK5 activity during mitosis, and observed mitotic defects, nuclear atypia and substantial alterations in the mitotic phosphoproteome. Notably, cyclin B1 is a mitotic co-factor of CDK5. Computational modelling, comparison with experimentally derived structures of CDK–cyclin complexes and validation with mutational analysis indicate that CDK5–cyclin B1 can form a functional complex. Disruption of the CDK5–cyclin B1 complex phenocopies CDK5 abrogation in mitosis. Together, our results demonstrate that cyclin B1 partners with both CDK5 and CDK1, and CDK5–cyclin B1 functions as a canonical CDK–cyclin complex to ensure mitotic fidelity.

 Infectious, inflammatory and autoimmune conditions present differently in males and females. SARS-CoV-2 infection in naive males is associated with increased risk of death, whereas females are at increased risk of long COVID1, similar to observations in other infections2. Females respond more strongly to vaccines, and adverse reactions are more frequent3, like most autoimmune diseases4. Immunological sex differences stem from genetic, hormonal and behavioural factors5 but their relative importance is only partially understood6–8. In individuals assigned female sex at birth and undergoing gender-affirming testosterone therapy (trans men), hormone concentrations change markedly but the immunological consequences are poorly understood. Here we performed longitudinal systems-level analyses in 23 trans men and found that testosterone modulates a cross-regulated axis between type-I interferon and tumour necrosis factor. This is mediated by functional attenuation of type-I interferon responses in both plasmacytoid dendritic cells and monocytes. Conversely, testosterone potentiates monocyte responses leading to increased tumour necrosis factor, interleukin-6 and interleukin-15 production and downstream activation of nuclear factor kappa B-regulated genes and potentiation of interferon-γ responses, primarily in natural killer cells. These findings in trans men are corroborated by sex-divergent responses in public datasets and illustrate the dynamic regulation of human immunity by sex hormones, with implications for the health of individuals undergoing hormone therapy and our understanding of sex-divergent immune responses in cisgender individuals. Examination of immunological changes in transgender individuals undergoing gender-affirming testosterone treatment reveals sex hormone-regulated pathways in humans and explains sex-divergent responses in cisgender individuals."

 Prokaryotic CRISPR–Cas immunity is subverted by anti-CRISPRs (Acrs), which inhibit Cas protein activities when expressed during the phage lytic cycle or from resident prophages or plasmids1. Acrs often bind to specific cognate Cas proteins, and hence inhibition is typically limited to a single CRISPR–Cas subtype2. Furthermore, although acr genes are frequently organized together in phage-associated gene clusters3, how such inhibitors initially evolve has remained unclear. Here we investigated the Acr content and inhibition specificity of diverse Listeria isolates, which naturally harbour four CRISPR–Cas systems (types I-B, II-A, II-C and VI-A). We observed widespread antagonism of CRISPR, which we traced to 11 previously unknown and 4 known acr gene families encoded by endogenous mobile elements. Among these were two Acrs that possess sequence homology to type I-B Cas proteins, one of which assembles into a defective interference complex. Surprisingly, an additional type I-B Cas homologue did not affect type I immunity, but instead inhibited the RNA-targeting type VI CRISPR system by means of CRISPR RNA (crRNA) degradation. By probing viral sequence databases, we detected abundant orphan cas genes located within putative anti-defence gene clusters. Among them, we verified the activity of a particularly broad-spectrum cas3 homologue that inhibits type I-B, II-A and VI-A CRISPR immunity. Our observations provide direct evidence of Acr evolution by cas gene co-option, and new genes with potential for broad-spectrum control of genome editing technologies.

 Exploring new strategies to manipulate the order parameter of magnetic materials by electrical means is of great importance not only for advancing our understanding of fundamental magnetism but also for unlocking potential applications. A well-established concept uses gate voltages to control magnetic properties by modulating the carrier population in a capacitor structure1–5. Here we show that, in Pt/Al/Fe/GaAs(001) multilayers, the application of an in-plane charge current in Pt leads to a shift in the ferromagnetic resonance field depending on the microwave frequency when the Fe film is sufficiently thin. The experimental observation is interpreted as a current-induced modification of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy ΔHA of Fe. We show that (1) ΔHA decreases with increasing Fe film thickness and is connected to the damping-like torque; and (2) ΔHA depends not only on the polarity of charge current but also on the magnetization direction, that is, ΔHA has an opposite sign when the magnetization direction is reversed. The symmetry of the modification is consistent with a current-induced spin6–8 and/or orbit9–13 accumulation, which, respectively, act on the spin and/or orbit component of the magnetization. In this study, as Pt is regarded as a typical spin current source6,14, the spin current can play a dominant part. The control of magnetism by a spin current results from the modified exchange splitting of the majority and minority spin bands, providing functionality that was previously unknown and could be useful in advanced spintronic devices.

 Optical atomic clocks1,2 use electronic energy levels to precisely keep track of time. A clock based on nuclear energy levels promises a next-generation platform for precision metrology and fundamental physics studies. Thorium-229 nuclei exhibit a uniquely low-energy nuclear transition within reach of state-of-the-art vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) laser light sources and have, therefore, been proposed for construction of a nuclear clock3,4. However, quantum-state-resolved spectroscopy of the 229mTh isomer to determine the underlying nuclear structure and establish a direct frequency connection with existing atomic clocks has yet to be performed. Here, we use a VUV frequency comb to directly excite the narrow 229Th nuclear clock transition in a solid-state CaF2 host material and determine the absolute transition frequency. We stabilize the fundamental frequency comb to the JILA 87Sr clock2 and coherently upconvert the fundamental to its seventh harmonic in the VUV range by using a femtosecond enhancement cavity. This VUV comb establishes a frequency link between nuclear and electronic energy levels and allows us to directly measure the frequency ratio of the 229Th nuclear clock transition and the 87Sr atomic clock. We also precisely measure the nuclear quadrupole splittings and extract intrinsic properties of the isomer. These results mark the start of nuclear-based solid-state optical clocks and demonstrate the first comparison, to our knowledge, of nuclear and atomic clocks for fundamental physics studies. This work represents a confluence of precision metrology, ultrafast strong-field physics, nuclear physics and fundamental physics.

 The canonical theory for planet formation in circumstellar disks proposes that planets are grown from initially much smaller seeds1–5. The long-considered alternative theory proposes that giant protoplanets can be formed directly from collapsing fragments of vast spiral arms6–11 induced by gravitational instability12–14—if the disk is gravitationally unstable. For this to be possible, the disk must be massive compared with the central star: a disk-to-star mass ratio of 1:10 is widely held as the rough threshold for triggering gravitational instability, inciting substantial non-Keplerian dynamics and generating prominent spiral arms15–18. Although estimating disk masses has historically been challenging19–21, the motion of the gas can reveal the presence of gravitational instability through its effect on the disk-velocity structure22–24. Here we present kinematic evidence of gravitational instability in the disk around AB Aurigae, using deep observations of 13CO and C18O line emission with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The observed kinematic signals strongly resemble predictions from simulations and analytic modelling. From quantitative comparisons, we infer a disk mass of up to a third of the stellar mass enclosed within 1″ to 5″ on the sky.

 The long-term physiological consequences of respiratory viral infections, particularly in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic—termed post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC)—are rapidly evolving into a major public health concern1–3. While the cellular and molecular aetiologies of these sequelae are poorly defined, increasing evidence implicates abnormal immune responses3–6 and/or impaired organ recovery7–9 after infection. However, the precise mechanisms that link these processes in the context of PASC remain unclear. Here, with insights from three cohorts of patients with respiratory PASC, we established a mouse model of post-viral lung disease and identified an aberrant immune–epithelial progenitor niche unique to fibroproliferation in respiratory PASC. Using spatial transcriptomics and imaging, we found a central role for lung-resident CD8+ T cell–macrophage interactions in impairing alveolar regeneration and driving fibrotic sequelae after acute viral pneumonia. Specifically, IFNγ and TNF derived from CD8+ T cells stimulated local macrophages to chronically release IL-1β, resulting in the long-term maintenance of dysplastic epithelial progenitors and lung fibrosis. Notably, therapeutic neutralization of IFNγ + TNF or IL-1β markedly improved alveolar regeneration and pulmonary function.

 Futuristic technologies such as morphing aircrafts and super-strong artificial muscles depend on metal alloys being as strong as ultrahigh-strength steel yet as flexible as a polymer1–3. However, achieving such ‘strong yet flexible’ alloys has proven challenging4–9 because of the inevitable trade-off between strength and flexibility5,8,10. Here we report a Ti–50.8 at.% Ni strain glass alloy showing a combination of ultrahigh yield strength of σy ≈ 1.8 GPa and polymer-like ultralow elastic modulus of E ≈ 10.5 GPa, together with super-large rubber-like elastic strain of approximately 8%. As a result, it possesses a high flexibility figure of merit of σy/E ≈ 0.17 compared with existing structural materials. In addition, it can maintain such properties over a wide temperature range of −80 °C to +80 °C and demonstrates excellent fatigue resistance at high strain. The alloy was fabricated by a simple three-step thermomechanical treatment that is scalable to industrial lines, which leads not only to ultrahigh strength because of deformation strengthening, but also to ultralow modulus by the formation of a unique ‘dual-seed strain glass’ microstructure, composed of a strain glass matrix embedded with a small number of aligned R and B19′ martensite ‘seeds’. In situ X-ray diffractometry shows that the polymer-like deformation behaviour of the alloy originates from a nucleation-free reversible transition between strain glass and R and B19′ martensite during loading and unloading. This exotic alloy with the potential for mass producibility may open a new horizon for many futuristic technologies, such as morphing aerospace vehicles, superman-type artificial muscles and artificial organs.

 Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the mammalian brain and provide structural and metabolic support to neurons, regulate synapses and become reactive after injury and disease. However, a small subset of astrocytes settles in specialized areas of the adult brain where these astrocytes instead actively generate differentiated neuronal and glial progeny and are therefore referred to as neural stem cells1–3. Common parenchymal astrocytes and quiescent neural stem cells share similar transcriptomes despite their very distinct functions4–6. Thus, how stem cell activity is molecularly encoded remains unknown. Here we examine the transcriptome, chromatin accessibility and methylome of neural stem cells and their progeny, and of astrocytes from the striatum and cortex in the healthy and ischaemic adult mouse brain. We identify distinct methylation profiles associated with either astrocyte or stem cell function. Stem cell function is mediated by methylation of astrocyte genes and demethylation of stem cell genes that are expressed later. Ischaemic injury to the brain induces gain of stemness in striatal astrocytes7. We show that this response involves reprogramming the astrocyte methylome to a stem cell methylome and is absent if the de novo methyltransferase DNMT3A is missing. Overall, we unveil DNA methylation as a promising target for regenerative medicine. Single-cell analysis of the transcriptome, chromatin accessibility and methylome of adult neural stem cells and astrocytes demonstrates that stemness is driven by methylation profiles distinct from those of astrocytes."

 The past two decades has witnessed a remarkable increase in the number of microbial genomes retrieved from marine systems1,2. However, it has remained challenging to translate this marine genomic diversity into biotechnological and biomedical applications3,4. Here we recovered 43,191 bacterial and archaeal genomes from publicly available marine metagenomes, encompassing a wide range of diversity with 138 distinct phyla, redefining the upper limit of marine bacterial genome size and revealing complex trade-offs between the occurrence of CRISPR–Cas systems and antibiotic resistance genes. In silico bioprospecting of these marine genomes led to the discovery of a novel CRISPR–Cas9 system, ten antimicrobial peptides, and three enzymes that degrade polyethylene terephthalate. In vitro experiments confirmed their effectiveness and efficacy.

 Systemic immune responses caused by chronic hypercholesterolaemia contribute to atherosclerosis initiation, progression and complications1. However, individuals often change their dietary habits over time2, and the effects of an alternating high-fat diet (HFD) on atherosclerosis remain unclear. Here, to address this relevant issue, we developed a protocol using atherosclerosis-prone mice to compare an alternating versus continuous HFD while maintaining similar overall exposure periods. We found that an alternating HFD accelerated atherosclerosis in Ldlr−/− and Apoe−/− mice compared with a continuous HFD. This pro-atherogenic effect of the alternating HFD was also observed in Apoe−/−Rag2−/− mice lacking T, B and natural killer T cells, ruling out the role of the adaptive immune system in the observed phenotype. Discontinuing the HFD in the alternating HFD group downregulated RUNX13, promoting inflammatory signalling in bone marrow myeloid progenitors. After re-exposure to an HFD, these cells produced IL-1β, leading to emergency myelopoiesis and increased neutrophil levels in blood. Neutrophils infiltrated plaques and released neutrophil extracellular traps, exacerbating atherosclerosis. Specific depletion of neutrophils or inhibition of IL-1β pathways abolished emergency myelopoiesis and reversed the pro-atherogenic effects of the alternating HFD. This study highlights the role of IL-1β-dependent neutrophil progenitor reprogramming in accelerated atherosclerosis induced by alternating HFD.

 Oncogenic mutations are abundant in the tissues of healthy individuals, but rarely form tumours1–3. Yet, the underlying protection mechanisms are largely unknown. To resolve these mechanisms in mouse mammary tissue, we use lineage tracing to map the fate of wild-type and Brca1−/−;Trp53−/− cells, and find that both follow a similar pattern of loss and spread within ducts. Clonal analysis reveals that ducts consist of small repetitive units of self-renewing cells that give rise to short-lived descendants. This offers a first layer of protection as any descendants, including oncogenic mutant cells, are constantly lost, thereby limiting the spread of mutations to a single stem cell-descendant unit. Local tissue remodelling during consecutive oestrous cycles leads to the cooperative and stochastic loss and replacement of self-renewing cells. This process provides a second layer of protection, leading to the elimination of most mutant clones while enabling the minority that by chance survive to expand beyond the stem cell-descendant unit. This leads to fields of mutant cells spanning large parts of the epithelial network, predisposing it for transformation. Eventually, clone expansion becomes restrained by the geometry of the ducts, providing a third layer of protection. Together, these mechanisms act to eliminate most cells that acquire somatic mutations at the expense of driving the accelerated expansion of a minority of cells, which can colonize large areas, leading to field cancerization. The authors use lineage tracing to map the fate of wild-type and Brca1−/−;Trp53−/− cells in the adult mouse mammary gland, identifying three layers of protection that limit the spread of mutant cells at the expense of allowing a minority of mutant cells to expand, which leads to field cancerization."

 Fifty-eight million individuals worldwide are affected by chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, a primary driver of liver cancer for which no vaccine is available1. The HCV envelope proteins E1 and E2 form a heterodimer (E1/E2), which is the target for neutralizing antibodies2. However, the higher-order organization of these E1/E2 heterodimers, as well as that of any Hepacivirus envelope protein complex, remains unknown. Here we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of two E1/E2 heterodimers in a homodimeric arrangement. We reveal how the homodimer is established at the molecular level and provide insights into neutralizing antibody evasion and membrane fusion by HCV, as orchestrated by E2 motifs such as hypervariable region 1 and antigenic site 412, as well as the organization of the transmembrane helices, including two internal to E1. This study addresses long-standing questions on the higher-order oligomeric arrangement of Hepacivirus envelope proteins and provides a critical framework in the design of novel HCV vaccine antigens.

 Histopathology image evaluation is indispensable for cancer diagnoses and subtype classification. Standard artificial intelligence methods for histopathology image analyses have focused on optimizing specialized models for each diagnostic task1,2. Although such methods have achieved some success, they often have limited generalizability to images generated by different digitization protocols or samples collected from different populations3. Here, to address this challenge, we devised the Clinical Histopathology Imaging Evaluation Foundation (CHIEF) model, a general-purpose weakly supervised machine learning framework to extract pathology imaging features for systematic cancer evaluation. CHIEF leverages two complementary pretraining methods to extract diverse pathology representations: unsupervised pretraining for tile-level feature identification and weakly supervised pretraining for whole-slide pattern recognition. We developed CHIEF using 60,530 whole-slide images spanning 19 anatomical sites. Through pretraining on 44 terabytes of high-resolution pathology imaging datasets, CHIEF extracted microscopic representations useful for cancer cell detection, tumour origin identification, molecular profile characterization and prognostic prediction. We successfully validated CHIEF using 19,491 whole-slide images from 32 independent slide sets collected from 24 hospitals and cohorts internationally. Overall, CHIEF outperformed the state-of-the-art deep learning methods by up to 36.1%, showing its ability to address domain shifts observed in samples from diverse populations and processed by different slide preparation methods. CHIEF provides a generalizable foundation for efficient digital pathology evaluation for patients with cancer.

 Animals such as raccoon dogs, mink and muskrats are farmed for fur and are sometimes used as food or medicinal products1,2, yet they are also potential reservoirs of emerging pathogens3. Here we performed single-sample metatranscriptomic sequencing of internal tissues from 461 individual fur animals that were found dead due to disease. We characterized 125 virus species, including 36 that were novel and 39 at potentially high risk of cross-species transmission, including zoonotic spillover. Notably, we identified seven species of coronaviruses, expanding their known host range, and documented the cross-species transmission of a novel canine respiratory coronavirus to raccoon dogs and of bat HKU5-like coronaviruses to mink, present at a high abundance in lung tissues. Three subtypes of influenza A virus—H1N2, H5N6 and H6N2—were detected in the lungs of guinea pig, mink and muskrat, respectively. Multiple known zoonotic viruses, such as Japanese encephalitis virus and mammalian orthoreovirus4,5, were detected in guinea pigs. Raccoon dogs and mink carried the highest number of potentially high-risk viruses, while viruses from the Coronaviridae, Paramyxoviridae and Sedoreoviridae families commonly infected multiple hosts. These data also reveal potential virus transmission between farmed animals and wild animals, and from humans to farmed animals, indicating that fur farming represents an important transmission hub for viral zoonoses.

 Viral glycoproteins drive membrane fusion in enveloped viruses and determine host range, tissue tropism and pathogenesis1. Despite their importance, there is a fragmentary understanding of glycoproteins within the Flaviviridae2, a large virus family that include pathogens such as hepatitis C, dengue and Zika viruses, and numerous other human, animal and emergent viruses. For many flaviviruses the glycoproteins have not yet been identified, for others, such as the hepaciviruses, the molecular mechanisms of membrane fusion remain uncharacterized3. Here we combine phylogenetic analyses with protein structure prediction to survey glycoproteins across the entire Flaviviridae. We find class II fusion systems, homologous to the Orthoflavivirus E glycoprotein in most species, including highly divergent jingmenviruses and large genome flaviviruses. However, the E1E2 glycoproteins of the hepaciviruses, pegiviruses and pestiviruses are structurally distinct, may represent a novel class of fusion mechanism, and are strictly associated with infection of vertebrate hosts. By mapping glycoprotein distribution onto the underlying phylogeny, we reveal a complex evolutionary history marked by the capture of bacterial genes and potentially inter-genus recombination. These insights, made possible through protein structure prediction, refine our understanding of viral fusion mechanisms and reveal the events that have shaped the diverse virology and ecology of the Flaviviridae.

 Our genomes influence nearly every aspect of human biology—from molecular and cellular functions to phenotypes in health and disease. Studying the differences in DNA sequence between individuals (genomic variation) could reveal previously unknown mechanisms of human biology, uncover the basis of genetic predispositions to diseases, and guide the development of new diagnostic tools and therapeutic agents. Yet, understanding how genomic variation alters genome function to influence phenotype has proved challenging. To unlock these insights, we need a systematic and comprehensive catalogue of genome function and the molecular and cellular effects of genomic variants. Towards this goal, the Impact of Genomic Variation on Function (IGVF) Consortium will combine approaches in single-cell mapping, genomic perturbations and predictive modelling to investigate the relationships among genomic variation, genome function and phenotypes. IGVF will create maps across hundreds of cell types and states describing how coding variants alter protein activity, how noncoding variants change the regulation of gene expression, and how such effects connect through gene-regulatory and protein-interaction networks. These experimental data, computational predictions and accompanying standards and pipelines will be integrated into an open resource that will catalyse community efforts to explore how our genomes influence biology and disease across populations.

 Traumatic injuries to the central nervous system (CNS) afflict millions of individuals worldwide1, yet an effective treatment remains elusive. Following such injuries, the site is populated by a multitude of peripheral immune cells, including T cells, but a comprehensive understanding of the roles and antigen specificity of these endogenous T cells at the injury site has been lacking. This gap has impeded the development of immune-mediated cellular therapies for CNS injuries. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we demonstrated the clonal expansion of mouse and human spinal cord injury-associated T cells and identified that CD4+ T cell clones in mice exhibit antigen specificity towards self-peptides of myelin and neuronal proteins. Leveraging mRNA-based T cell receptor (TCR) reconstitution, a strategy aimed to minimize potential adverse effects from prolonged activation of self-reactive T cells, we generated engineered transiently autoimmune T cells. These cells demonstrated notable neuroprotective efficacy in CNS injury models, in part by modulating myeloid cells via IFNγ. Our findings elucidate mechanistic insight underlying the neuroprotective function of injury-responsive T cells and pave the way for the future development of T cell therapies for CNS injuries. This study presents a new T cell therapy targeting spinal cord injury, providing a potential new approach for injured CNS."

 Myocarditis is the most salient serious adverse event following messenger RNA-based Covid-19 vaccines. The highest risk is observed after the second dose compared to the first, whereas the level of risk associated with more distant booster doses seems to lie in between. We aimed to assess the relation between dosing interval and the risk of myocarditis, for both the two-dose primary series and the third dose (first booster). This matched case-control study included 7911 cases of myocarditis aged 12 or more in a period where approximately 130 million vaccine doses were administered. Here we show that longer intervals between each consecutive dose, including booster, may decrease the occurrence of vaccine-associated myocarditis by up to a factor of 4, especially under age 50.

 Beige fat activation involves a fuel switch to fatty acid oxidation following chronic cold adaptation. Mitochondrial acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1 (ACSL1) localizes in the mitochondria and plays a key role in fatty acid oxidation; however, the regulatory mechanism of the subcellular localization remains poorly understood. Here, we identify an endosomal trafficking component sortilin (encoded by Sort1) in adipose tissues that shows dynamic expression during beige fat activation and facilitates the translocation of ACSL1 from the mitochondria to the endolysosomal pathway for degradation. Depletion of sortilin in adipocytes results in an increase of mitochondrial ACSL1 and the activation of AMPK/PGC1α signaling, thereby activating beige fat and preventing high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Collectively, our findings indicate that sortilin controls adipose tissue fatty acid oxidation by substrate fuel selection during beige fat activation and provides a potential targeted approach for the treatment of metabolic diseases.

 Autophagy is a finely orchestrated process required for the lysosomal degradation of cytosolic components.

Analyses of RNAseK knockout cells reveal that, while autophagosome maturation is intact, cargo degradation is severely disrupted. Importantly, lysosomal protease activity and acidification remain intact in the absence of RNAseK suggesting a specificity to autolysosome degradation. Analyses of lysosome fractions show reduced levels of a subset of hydrolases in the absence of RNAseK. Of these, the knockdown of PLD3 leads to a defect in autophagosome clearance. Furthermore, the lysosomal fraction of RNAseK-depleted cells exhibits an accumulation of the ESCRT-III complex component, VPS4a, which is required for the lysosomal targeting of PLD3. Altogether, here we identify a lysosomal hydrolase delivery pathway required for efficient autolysosome degradation. The degradation of inner autophagosomal membranes remains poorly understood. Here, Makar et al. show that RNAseK is involved in a lysosomal hydrolase delivery pathway that contributes to autophagosomal membrane degradation."

 Optical wireless communication (OWC) stands out as one of the most promising technologies in the sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks. The establishment of high-quality optical links between transmitters and receivers plays a crucial role in OWC performances. Here, by a compact beam splitter composed of a metasurface and a fiber array, we proposed a wide-angle (~120°) OWC optical link scheme that can parallelly support up to 144 communication users. Utilizing high-speed optical module sources and wavelength division multiplexing technique, we demonstrated each user can achieve a communication speed of 200 Gbps which enables the entire system to support ultra-high communication capacity exceeding 28 Tbps. Furthermore, utilizing the metasurface polarization multiplexing, we implemented a full range wide-angle OWC without blind area nor crosstalk among users.

 Capturing extreme surface velocities with  >50 km/s dynamic range, which arise in shock physics such as inertial confinement fusion (ICF), is beyond the reach of conventional photon Doppler velocimetry (PDV) systems due to the need for extremely large electrical bandwidth under such conditions. The recent ignition in ICF calls for new velocimetry that can measure velocities exceeding 100 km/s. Time lens PDV (TL-PDV) is a solution where the high frequency beat signal from a conventional PDV system is periodically temporally magnified in the optical domain using a time lens. Here we experimentally demonstrate TL-PDV for the first time, validate the performance over a 74 km/s velocity range with high accuracy using a temporal magnification factor of 7.6, and verify excellent agreement with conventional PDV for laser driven micro-flyer experiments. TL-PDV currently provides the largest velocity dynamic range among PDV systems and is scalable to even higher velocities, which makes it an ideal candidate for material characterization under the most extreme conditions such as optimizing fuel efficiency in ICF experiments.

 Climate change is projected to have substantial economic, social, and environmental impacts worldwide. Currently, the leading solutions for hydrogen storage are in salt caverns, and depleted natural gas reservoirs. However, the required geological formations are limited to certain regions. To increase alternatives for hydrogen storage, this paper proposes storing hydrogen in pipes filled with gravel in lakes, hydropower, and pumped hydro storage reservoirs.

 China faces challenges in reaching its carbon neutrality goal by the year 2060 to meet the Paris Agreement and improving air quality simultaneously. Dramatic nitrogen emission reductions will be brought by this ambitious target, yet their impact on the natural ecosystem is not clear. Here, by combining two atmospheric chemistry models and two process-based terrestrial ecosystem models constrained using nationwide measurements, we show that atmospheric nitrogen deposition in China’s terrestrial land will decrease by 44–57% following two emission control scenarios including one aiming at carbon neutrality. They consequently result in a pronounced shrinkage in terrestrial net ecosystem production, by 11–20% depending on models and emission scenarios. Our results indicate that the nitrogen emission reductions accompanying decarbonization would undermine natural carbon sinks and in turn set back progress toward carbon neutrality. This unintended impact calls for great concern about the trade-offs between nitrogen management and carbon neutrality.

Here the authors investigate exploration behaviour across different domains and whether tendency to explore is stable over time. 
 Given the ubiquity of exploration in everyday life, researchers from many disciplines have developed methods to measure exploratory behaviour. There are therefore many ways to quantify and measure exploration. However, it remains unclear whether the different measures (i) have convergent validity relative to one another, (ii) capture a domain general tendency, and (iii) capture a tendency that is stable across time. In a sample of 678 participants, we found very little evidence of convergent validity for the behavioural measures (Hypothesis 1); most of the behavioural measures lacked sufficient convergent validity with one another or with the self-reports. In psychometric modelling analyses, we could not identify a good fitting model with an assumed general tendency to explore (Hypothesis 2); the best fitting model suggested that the different behavioural measures capture behaviours that are specific to the tasks. In a subsample of 254 participants who completed the study a second time, we found that the measures had stability across an 1 month timespan (Hypothesis 3). Therefore, although there were stable individual differences in how people approached each task across time, there was no generalizability across tasks, and drawing broad conclusions about exploratory behaviour from studies using these tasks may be problematic.

 Reducing fisheries bycatches of vulnerable species is critical to marine biodiversity conservation and sustainable fisheries development.

Here, we used a meta-analysis approach to quantify the effects of 42 technical measures on the target catch and the bycatch of seabirds, elasmobranchs, marine mammals and sea turtles. We showed that these measures generally reduced the bycatch while having no statistically significant effect on the target catch. Sensory-based measures generally outperformed physical-based ones in reducing the bycatch. Mitigation measures that worked well for several fishing gears or taxa, although useful, were very rare. Most of the adoptions by regional fisheries management organizations (59%) were supported by our findings, although many others are yet to be robustly evaluated.

 Sustainable energy and food production can include double-cropping where two crops are produced sequentially on land required for one crop to maximize resource use. In Brazil, this system involves maize being planted as a second crop following soybean to generate ethanol, thus allowing for combined food–energy production. However, the impacts of such production systems on several sustainable development goals (SDG) and associated indirect land-use changes have not yet fully been explored. We evaluate the fast-expanding food–energy system of double-cropped maize ethanol in the Central-West region of Brazil with respect to SDG impacts, combining life-cycle environmental and computable general equilibrium socio-economic models. We find that this system provides renewable and affordable energy (5 billion litres of ethanol, 600 MWh of electrical power) and feed (4 million tons of distillers dried grains), reduces greenhouse gas emissions (9.3 million to 13.2 million tCO2e), saves land (160,000 ha), boosts regional income and consumption, improves food security and benefits ecosystems and human health. Underlying drivers associated with this were the integration of feedstock supply into existing practices and the use of eucalyptus chips to provide process energy. The sustainability of this production system is improved further by carbon capture and storage.

 Many fruits and nuts crops in California require sufficient winter chill to break dormancy, and insufficient chill can harm fruit quantity and quality. Early information on winter chill forecast can help growers prepare for a low chill year. Here we evaluate use of dynamic climate models for chill accumulation forecast in California.

 Forest canopy height (FCH) is crucial for monitoring forest structure and aboveground biomass. Light detecting and ranging (LiDAR), as a promising remote sensing technology, provides various forms of data for measuring and mapping FCH. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) could accurately measure FCH at the plot-level. Spaceborne lidar system (SLS) allows for global sampling of FCH at the footprint-level. However, ALS data has limited spatial coverage, while SLS data has relatively lower estimation accuracy. To this end, we proposed a two-step FCH mapping framework by combining ALS, SLS and auxiliary data. Firstly, using the ALS-derived FCH as reference, the SLS-derived relative height metrics were calibrated at the footprint-level using a regression method. Secondly, to further address the spatial discontinuities in SLS-derived FCH maps, a site-level FCH model was built using a weighted ensemble multi-machine learning model incorporating spatial effects (WEML_SE). The calibrated footprint-level calibration FCH model was used as a reference, and multiple remote sensing data metrics were selected and subjected to important variable selection. Specifically, a spatial adjacency matrix was established based on the spatial locations of SLS footprints, and spatial feature vectors were extracted. The result indicated that the correlation coefficient between the SLS-derived FCH and the ALS-derived FCH (r = 0.39–0.73, MRE=10.6–25.9 %, and RMSE=2.58–9.37 m) improved at footprint-level (r = 0.71–0.84, MRE=7.7–18.7 %, RMSE=1.96–7.68 m). Moreover, the WEML_SE exhibited better performance (r = 0.59–0.75, MRE=8.8–14.8 %, RMSE=2.12–5.4 m) compared to the model without incorporating spatial effects (r = 0.45–0.71, MRE=9.4–15.8 %, RMSE=2.28–5.89 m). This study emphasizes the advantages of integrating spaceborne and airborne LiDAR data to construct footprint-level estimation of FCH.

 Reconstructing semantic indoor scenes is a challenging task in augmented and virtual reality. The quality of scene reconstruction is limited by the complexity and occlusion of indoor scenes. This is due to the difficulty in estimating the spatial structure of the scene and insufficient learning for object location inference. To address these challenges, we have developed PesRec, an end-to-end multi-task scene reconstruction network for parameterizing indoor semantic information. PesRec incorporates a newly designed spatial layout estimator and a 3D object detector to effectively learn scene parameter features from RGB images. We modify an object mesh generator to enhance the robustness of reconstructing indoor occluded objects through point cloud optimization in PesRec. Using the analyzed scene parameters and spatial structure, the proposed PesRec reconstructs an indoor scene by placing object meshes scaled to 3D detection boxes in an estimated layout cuboid.

 The hierarchical structure of geographic or urban space can be well-characterized by the concept of living structure, a term coined by Christopher Alexander. All spaces, regardless of their size, possess certain degrees of livingness that can be mathematically quantified. While previous studies have successfully quantified the livingness of small spaces such as images or artworks, the livingness of geographic space has not yet been characterized in a recursive manner. Zipf’s law has been observed in urban systems and intra-urban structures. However, whether Zipf’s law is applicable to the hierarchical substructures of geographic space has rarely been investigated. In this study, we recursively extract the substructures of geographic space using global nighttime light imagery. We quantify the livingness of global cities considering the number of substructures (S) and their inherent hierarchy (H). We further investigate the scaling properties of the extracted substructures across scales and the relationships between livingness and population for global cities. The results demonstrate that all substructures of global cities form a living structure that conforms to Zipf’s law. The degree of livingness better captures population distribution than nighttime light intensity values for the global cities. This study contributes in three aspects: First, it considers global cities as a whole to quantify spatial livingness. Second, it applies the concept of livingness to cities to better capture the spatial structure of the population using nighttime light data. Third, it introduces a novel method to recursively extract substructures from nighttime images, offering a valuable tool to investigate urban structures across multiple spatial scales."

 Burned forests were detected using remote sensing techniques. Yet, identifying long-term burned forests in the mountains, especially at a large spatial extent, remains a great challenge due to a lack of long-term high-resolution remote sensing data or the unsatisfactory performance of the moderate-resolution remotely sensed data in complex mountain landscapes. Efficient, robust, and cost-effective methods are urgently called for. In this study, we developed a novel method combining remote sensing and ecological mechanisms (short for RSEM-M) with a paired-pixel approach to identify the long-term burned forests in Southwest China, where the terrain is rugged. In mapping burned forests in 2010, the overall accuracy, producer accuracy, user accuracy, Kappa coefficient, and field validation accuracy were 92.27 %, 95.86 %, 88.36 %, 0.85, and 81.16 %, respectively. Compared to the standard procedure and FireCCI51 and MCD64A1 fire products, the RSEM-M shows higher accuracy and consistency in identifying burned forests of different sizes, with fewer invalid pixels, better spatial continuity, and more accurate boundary delineation. Then, using the RSEM-M, we mapped burned forests in Southwest China from 2002 to 2017. The cumulative areas were 37.69 × 104 ha. The RSEM-M improved the efficiency and accuracy of long-term burned forest identifications in mountainous landscapes at a large spatial extent."

Recent advancements in chimeric antigen receptor development and genome editing aim to enhance the specificity and function of Tregcells. However, impurities and functional instability pose challenges for the development of safe gene-edited Tregcell products. Here, we examined different Tregcell subsets regarding their fate, epigenomic stability, transcriptomes, T cell receptor repertoires, and function ex vivo and after manufacturing. Each Tregcell subset displayed distinct features, including lineage stability, epigenomics, surface markers, T cell receptor diversity, and transcriptomics. Earlier-differentiated memory Tregcell populations, including a hitherto unidentified naïve-like memory Tregcell subset, outperformed late-differentiated effector memory–like Tregcells in regulatory function, proliferative capacity, and epigenomic stability. High yields of stable, functional Tregcell products could be achieved by depleting the small effector memory–like Tregcell subset before manufacturing. Considering Tregcell subset composition appears critical to maintain lineage stability in the final cell product."

Here, we applied advanced microscopy to demonstrate that TCR/CD3-based synthetic constructs (TCC) outperform second-generation CAR formats with regard to conveyed antigen sensitivities by up to a thousandfold. TCC-based antigen recognition occurred without adverse nonspecific signaling, which is typically observed in CAR–T cells, and did not depend—unlike sensitized peptide/MHC detection by conventional T cells—on CD4 or CD8 coreceptor engagement. TCC-endowed signaling properties may prove critical when targeting antigens in low abundance and aiming for a durable anticancer response."

Good software and elaborate heuristics exist, but the process remains laboriously manual. Machine learning does help, but its training databases need millions of samples that cover all relevant physics and every kind of instrumental artifact. In this communication, we offer a solution to this problem. We propose polyadic decompositions to store millions of simulated three-dimensional NMR spectra, on-the-fly generation of artifacts during training, a probabilistic way to incorporate prior and posterior information, and integration with the industry standard CcpNmr software framework. The resulting neural nets take [1H,13C] slices of mixed pyruvate–labeled HNCA spectra (different CA signal shapes for different residue types) and return an amino acid probability table. In combination with primary sequence information, backbones of common proteins (GB1, MBP, and INMT) are rapidly assigned from just the HNCA spectrum."

Here, we develop a generalizable process to introduce nanoscale grooves to the surface of metal powders which increases the powder absorptivity by up to 70% during laser powder bed fusion. Absorptivity enhancements in copper, copper-silver, and tungsten enable energy-efficient manufacturing, with printing of pure copper at relative densities up to 92% using laser energy densities as low as 83 joules per cubic millimeter. Simulations show that the enhanced powder absorptivity results from plasmon-enabled light concentration in nanoscale grooves combined with multiple scattering events. The approach taken here demonstrates a general method to enhance the absorptivity and printability of reflective and refractory metal powders by changing the surface morphology of the feedstock without altering its composition."

Here, we demonstrate hexagonal ~5-nanometer-thick palladium antimony (chemical formula as Pd8Sb3) nanosheets (NSs) that exhibit strong light absorption within full spectral and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effects in the visible region. Such LSPR features lead to strong photothermal effects, and Pd8Sb3NSs aqueous dispersion enables enhanced photothermal methane (CH4) conversion to formaldehyde (HCHO) under full-spectrum light irradiation at 1.7 watts per square centimeter, leading to selectivity of ~98.7%, productivity of ~665 millimoles per gram of catalyst, ~700 times higher than that of Pd NSs. Mechanism investigations suggest that different radicals were generated on Pd8Sb3(·OH) and Pd NSs (·O2−), where Pd8Sb3NSs displays stronger adsorption strength to CH4and facilitates CH4oxidation to HCHO. Besides, the strong light absorption ability of Pd8Sb3NSs enables photothermal therapy for breast cancer."

Scott,Cerebrospinal fluid flow extends to peripheral nerves further unifying the nervous system,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is responsible for maintaining brain homeostasis through nutrient delivery and waste removal for the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we demonstrate extensive CSF flow throughout the peripheral nervous system (PNS) by tracing distribution of multimodal 1.9-nanometer gold nanoparticles, roughly the size of CSF circulating proteins, infused within the lateral cerebral ventricle (a primary site of CSF production). CSF-infused 1.9-nanometer gold transitions from CNS to PNS at root attachment/transition zones and distributes through the perineurium and endoneurium, with ultimate delivery to axoplasm of distal peripheral nerves. Larger 15-nanometer gold fails to transit from CNS to PNS and instead forms “dye-cuffs,” as predicted by current dogma of CSF restriction within CNS, identifying size limitations in central to peripheral flow. Intravenous 1.9-nanometer gold is unable to cross the blood-brain/nerve barrier. Our findings suggest that CSF plays a consistent role in maintaining homeostasis throughout the nervous system with implications for CNS and PNS therapy and neural drug delivery."

However, there have been few examples of soft electronics where all components have self-healing properties while also ensuring compatibility between components to achieve multifunctional and resilient bio-integrated electronics. Here, we introduce a stretchable, biodegradable, self-healing conductor constructed by combination of two layers: (i) synthetic self-healing elastomer and (ii) self-healing conductive composite with additives. Abundant dynamic disulfide and hydrogen bonds of the elastomer and conductive composite enable rapid and complete recovery of electrical conductivity (~1000 siemens per centimeter) and stretchability (~500%) in response to repetitive damages, and chemical interactions of interpenetrated polymer chains of these components facilitate robust adhesion strength, even under extreme mechanical stress.

However, how it is involved in disease progression is not fully clear. We interrogated the interactome of Kv1.3 in intact cells using BioID proximity labeling, revealing that Kv1.3 interacts with STAT3– and p53–linked pathways. To prove the relevance of Kv1.3 and of its interactome in the context of tumorigenesis, we generated stable melanoma clones, in which ablation of Kv1.3 remodeled gene expression, reduced proliferation and colony formation, yielded fourfold smaller tumors, and decreased metastasis in vivo in comparison to WT cells. Kv1.3 deletion or pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial Kv1.3 increased mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species release, decreased STAT3 phosphorylation, stabilized the p53 tumor suppressor, promoted metabolic switch, and altered the expression of several BioID-identified Kv1.3-networking proteins in tumor tissues. Collectively, our work revealed the tumor-promoting Kv1.3-interactome landscape, thus opening the way to target Kv1.3 not only as an ion-conducting entity but also as a signaling hub."
