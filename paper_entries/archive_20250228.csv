10.1088/1748-9326/adaa8a,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇研究论文利用卫星观测数据（1985年至今）和统计模型，研究了全球平均海表温度（GMSST）的变化趋势。结果表明，GMSST的上升速率正在加快，这与地球能量收支的上升趋势有关。研究量化了GMSST的增加与累积能量之间的关系，并预测未来GMSST的上升速度可能快于过去几十年的线性外推结果。该研究强调了减少化石燃料燃烧以减缓全球变暖的紧迫性。总的来说，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它利用卫星观测数据来研究气候变化，并对地球的能量收支和海表温度变化进行了分析。,"['Sea surface temperature', 'Satellite observations', 'Climate change', ""Earth's energy imbalance"", 'Global warming']",Christopher J Merchant;Richard P Allan;Owen Embury,Quantifying the acceleration of multidecadal global sea surface warming driven by Earth’s energy imbalance,"Global mean sea surface temperature (GMSST) is a fundamental diagnostic of ongoing climate change, yet there is incomplete understanding of multi-decadal changes in warming rate and year-to-year variability. Exploiting satellite observations since 1985 and a statistical model incorporating drivers of variability and change, we identify an increasing rate of rise in GMSST. This accelerating ocean surface warming is physically linked to an upward trend in Earth’s energy imbalance (EEI). We quantify that GMSST has increased by 0.54 0.07 K for each GJ m–2 of accumulated energy, equivalent to 0.17 ± 0.02 K decade‒1 (W m‒2)‒1. Using the statistical model to isolate the trend from interannual variability, the underlying rate of change of GMSST rises in proportion with Earth’s energy accumulation from 0.06 K decade–1 during 1985–89 to 0.27 K decade–1 for 2019–23. While variability associated with the El Niño Southern Oscillation triggered the exceptionally high GMSSTs of 2023 and early 2024, 44% (90% confidence interval: 35%–52%) of the +0.22 K difference in GMSST between the peak of the 2023/24 event and that of the 2015/16 event is unexplained unless the acceleration of the GMSST trend is accounted for. Applying indicative future scenarios of EEI based on recent trends, GMSST increases are likely to be faster than would be expected from linear extrapolation of the past four decades. Our results provide observational evidence that the GMSST increase inferred over the past 40 years will likely be exceeded within the next 20 years. Policy makers and wider society should be aware that the rate of global warming over recent decades is a poor guide to the faster change that is likely over the decades to come, underscoring the urgency of deep reductions in fossil-fuel burning."
10.5194/acp-25-1105-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了1850年到2014年间大气中一氧化碳浓度的变化，重点关注的是利用格陵兰和南极洲的冰芯记录与全球化学气候模型的模拟结果进行对比分析。研究发现，模型在模拟北半球1920年到1975年间一氧化碳浓度增长速率方面存在偏差，这可能与一氧化碳排放因子估算的不确定性有关。南半球的模型模拟结果与观测结果较为一致，支持了CMIP6生物质燃烧一氧化碳排放清单的可靠性。该研究使用了冰芯记录作为一种大气环境遥感技术手段，间接反映了过去大气中一氧化碳的浓度，并与全球模型进行对比，以评估模型的准确性和改进对过去大气成分的理解。虽然没有直接使用卫星观测数据，但研究结果对改进大气成分分析模型和评估空气质量具有重要意义，属于大气环境遥感相关研究范畴。,"['Carbon Monoxide', 'Atmospheric Composition', 'Ice Core Analysis', 'Global Chemistry-Climate Models', 'Air Quality', 'Preindustrial Atmosphere', 'Anthropogenic Emissions']",Xavier Faïn;Sophie Szopa;Vaishali Naïk;Patricia Martinerie;David M.

Petrenko;Kévin Fourteau;Philip Place,Preindustrial-to-present-day changes in atmospheric carbon monoxide: agreement and gaps between ice archives and global model reconstructions,"Carbon monoxide (CO) plays a crucial role in the atmosphere's oxidizing capacity. In this study, we analyse how historical (1850–2014) [CO] outputs from state-of-the-art global chemistry–climate models over Greenland and Antarctica are able to capture both absolute values and trends recorded in multi-site ice archives. A disparity in [CO] growth rates emerges in the Northern Hemisphere between models and observations from 1920–1975 CE, possibly linked to uncertainties in CO emission factors. 
 Global chemistry–climate models (CCMs) play an important role in assessing the climate and air pollution implications of aerosols and chemically reactive gases. Evaluating these models under past conditions and constraining historical sources and sinks necessitate reliable records of atmospheric mixing ratios spanning preindustrial times. Such precious records were recently obtained for carbon monoxide (CO), documenting for the first time the evolution of this reactive compound over the industrial era. In this study, we compare the simulated atmospheric surface CO mixing ratios ([CO]) from two different sets of chemistry–climate models and emissions within the frameworks of CMIP5 and of CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phases 5 and 6) to recent bipolar ice archive reconstructions for the period spanning 1850 to the present. We analyse how historical (1850–2014) [CO] outputs from 16 ACCMIP (Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison Project) models and 7 AerChemMIP (Aerosol Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project) models over Greenland and Antarctica are able to capture both absolute values and trends recorded in multi-site ice archives. While most models underestimate [CO] at northern high latitudes, a reduction in this bias is observed between the ACCMIP and the AerChemMIP exercise. Over the 1980–2010 CE period (common era; all subsequent years in the paper are reported in CE), trends in ice archive and firn air observations and AerChemMIP outputs align remarkably well at northern and southern high latitudes, indicating improved quantification of anthropogenic CO emissions and the main CO sink (OH oxidation) compared to ACCMIP. From 1850 to 1980, AerChemMIP models and observations consistently show increasing [CO] in both the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH), suggesting a robust understanding of the CO budget evolution. However, a divergence in the [CO] growth rate emerges in the NH between models and observations over the 1920–1980 period, attributed to uncertainties in CO emission factors (EFs), particularly EFs for the RCO (residential, commercial, and other) and transportation sectors, although we cannot totally rule out the possibility that the CO record based on the Greenland ice archives may be biased high by CO chemical production processes occurring in the ice prior to the measurements (i.e. in situ CO production). In the Southern Hemisphere, AerChemMIP models simulate an increase in atmospheric [CO] from 1850 to 1980 that closely reproduces the observations (22 ± 10 ppb and 13 ± 7 ppb, respectively). Such agreement supports CMIP6 biomass burning CO emission inventories, which do not reveal a peak in CO emissions in the late 19th century. Furthermore, both SH models and observations reveal an accelerated growth rate in [CO] during 1945–1980 relative to 1850–1945, likely linked to increased anthropogenic transportation emissions."
10.5194/acp-25-1145-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了南极四个不同地区（包括海岸和内陆）一年中气溶胶粒径分布的季节性变化。研究发现，不同地区的表面类型和气团来源对气溶胶的组成和数量有显著影响。例如，沿海地区受海冰和开阔海洋的影响较大，新粒子形成较多；而内陆地区则更多地受到大气传输和老化过程的影响。研究利用k-means聚类分析将气溶胶粒径分布数据分为六类，并分析了不同类型气溶胶的时空分布特征。该研究强调了理解南极地区地理差异对认识气溶胶来源和气候模式至关重要，这与大气环境遥感技术，特别是地面空气质量监测和大气成分分析密切相关，可以为改进全球气候模型中气溶胶辐射强迫的不确定性提供数据支持。,"['Aerosol size distributions', 'Antarctic atmospheric composition', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Seasonal cycle of aerosols', 'Ground-based measurements']",James Brean;David C.

 In order to reduce the uncertainty of aerosol radiative forcing in global climate models, we need to better understand natural aerosol sources which are important to constrain the current and pre-industrial climate. Here, we analyse particle number size distributions (PNSDs) collected during a year (2015) across four coastal and inland Antarctic research bases (Halley, Marambio, Dome C and King Sejong). We utilise k-means cluster analysis to separate the PNSD data into six main categories. “Nucleation” and “bursting” PNSDs occur 28 %–48 % of the time between sites, most commonly at the coastal sites of Marambio and King Sejong where air masses mostly come from the west and travel over extensive regions of sea ice, marginal ice and open ocean and likely arise from new particle formation. “Aitken high”, “Aitken low” and “bimodal” PNSDs occur 37 %–68 % of the time, most commonly at Dome C on the Antarctic Plateau, and likely arise from atmospheric transport and ageing from aerosol originating likely in both the coastal boundary layer and free troposphere. “Pristine” PNSDs with low aerosol concentrations occur 12 %–45 % of the time, most commonly at Halley,  located at low altitudes and far from the coastal melting ice and influenced by air masses from the west. Not only the sea spray primary aerosols and gas to particle secondary aerosol sources, but also the different air masses impacting the research stations should be kept in mind when deliberating upon different aerosol precursor sources across research stations. We infer that both primary and secondary components from pelagic and sympagic regions strongly contribute to the annual seasonal cycle of Antarctic aerosols. Our simultaneous aerosol measurements stress the importance of the variation in atmospheric biogeochemistry across the Antarctic region."
10.5194/amt-18-509-2025,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,这篇论文介绍了一种名为SKYDEW的基于珀耳帖元件的冷却镜面湿度计，用于测量对流层和平流层水汽。文章详细描述了仪器的研制、测试和数据处理过程，包括在不同条件下进行的实验结果以及与其他测量仪器（例如无线电探空仪上的相对湿度传感器、低温露点湿度计和Aura微波临边探测器）的比对结果。研究结果表明，SKYDEW能够可靠地测量高达25公里高度的大气水汽，为气候监测和大气成分分析提供了重要的观测数据。其研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是卫星观测和大气成分分析，因为SKYDEW的测量结果可以与卫星数据进行比对，以验证和改进卫星遥感算法，并提高对大气水汽分布的认识。,"['water vapor', 'stratospheric water vapor', 'tropospheric water vapor', 'chilled-mirror hygrometer', 'atmospheric composition', 'remote sensing', 'satellite observations', 'Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS)', 'climate monitoring']",Takuji Sugidachi;Masatomo Fujiwara;Kensaku Shimizu;Shin-Ya Ogino;Junko Suzuki;Ruud J. Dirksen,"Development of a Peltier-based chilled-mirror hygrometer, SKYDEW, for tropospheric and lower-stratospheric water vapor measurements","A Peltier-based chilled-mirror hygrometer, SKYDEW, has been developed to measure tropospheric and stratospheric water vapor. Continuous accurate measurements of water vapor are essential for climate monitoring. More than 40 soundings with SKYDEW have been conducted since 2011 to evaluate the performance. The result of soundings at tropical and midlatitudes demonstrated that SKYDEW is able to measure up to an altitude of 20–25 km for daytime soundings and above 25 km for nighttime soundings. 
 We have developed a Peltier-based non-cryogenic chilled-mirror hygrometer named SKYDEW to measure water vapor from the surface to the stratosphere. Several chamber experiments were conducted to investigate the characteristics and performance of the instrument under various conditions. The stability of the feedback controller that maintains the condensate on the mirror depends on the controller setting, the condensate condition, and the frost point in ambient air. The results of condensate observation by a microscope and proportional-integral-derivative (PID) tuning in a chamber were used to determine the PID parameters of the controller such that slight oscillations of the scattered light signal from the mirror and mirror temperature are retained. This allows for the detection of steep gradients in the humidity profile, which are otherwise not detected because of the slower response. The oscillation of the raw mirror temperature is smoothed with a golden point method that selects the equilibrium point of the frost layer. We further describe the details of the data processing and the uncertainty estimation for SKYDEW measurements in terms of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) Reference Upper-Air Network (GRUAN) requirements. The calibration uncertainty of the mirror temperature measurement is < 0.1 K for the entire temperature range from −95 to 40 °C. The total measurement uncertainty of SKYDEW measurements can exceed 0.5 K in regions where large oscillations of the mirror temperature remain.Intercomparisons with relative humidity (RH) sensors on radiosondes, the cryogenic frost point hygrometer (CFH), and the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) were performed at various latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere to evaluate the performance of SKYDEW. These results show that SKYDEW can reliably measure atmospheric water vapor up to 25 km altitude. Data from several SKYDEW and CFH measurements predominantly agree within their respective uncertainties, although a systematic difference of ∼ 0.5 K between SKYDEW and CFH was found in the stratosphere, the reason for which is unknown. SKYDEW shows good agreement with Aura MLS for profiles that are not affected by contamination."
10.5194/essd-17-277-2025,True,Earth System Science Data,这篇论文研究了船舶排放清单，使用了先进的建模技术，构建了一个高时空分辨率的全球船舶排放清单数据集（0.1°×0.1°），涵盖2013年和2016-2021年。该数据集包含四种温室气体和五种空气污染物的排放数据，数据精度高，可用于多种科学研究。研究利用AIS数据，结合船舶技术参数、排放因子等，模拟了船舶的排放情况。结果显示，2021年全球船舶排放了大量的CO2、SO2、NOx、PM2.5等污染物，并分析了不同船型、船龄和海域的排放特征。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为船舶排放是影响大气成分的重要因素，而卫星观测和空气质量监测可以用来验证和补充该研究的数据。研究结果可用于改进大气成分分析模型，提高空气质量监测的精度，并为制定船舶减排政策提供数据支持。,"['Greenhouse gases', 'Air pollutants', 'CO2', 'SO2', 'NOx', 'PM2.5', 'Black carbon', 'Satellite observations', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Atmospheric composition analysis', 'Emission inventory', 'Shipping emissions']",Wen Yi;Xiaotong Wang;Tingkun He;Huan Liu;Zhenyu Luo;Zhaofeng Lv;Kebin He,The high-resolution global shipping emission inventory by the Shipping Emission Inventory Model (SEIM),"This study presents a detailed global dataset on ship emissions, covering the years 2013 and 2016–2021, using advanced modeling techniques. The dataset includes emissions data for four types of greenhouse gases and five types of air pollutants. The data, available for research, offer valuable insights into ship emission spatiotemporal patterns by vessel type and age, providing a solid data foundation for fine-scale scientific research and shipping emission mitigation. 
 The high-resolution ship emission inventory serves as a crucial dataset for various disciplines including atmospheric science, marine science, and environmental management. Here, we present a global high-spatiotemporal-resolution ship emission inventory at a resolution of 0.1° × 0.1° for the years 2013 and 2016–2021, generated by the state-of-the-art Shipping Emission Inventory Model (SEIMv2.2). Initially, the annual 30 billion Automatic Identification System (AIS) data underwent extensive cleaning to ensure data validity and accuracy in temporal and spatial distribution. Subsequently, integrating real-time vessel positions and speeds from AIS data with static technical parameters, emission factors, and other computational parameters, SEIM simulated ship emissions on a ship-by-ship, signal-by-signal basis. Finally, the results were aggregated and analyzed. In 2021, the ship activity dataset established based on AIS data covered 109 300 vessels globally (101 400 vessels reported by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development). Concerning the major air pollutants and greenhouse gases, global ships emitted 847.2×106 t of CO2, 2.3×106 t of SO2, 16.1×106 t of NOx, 791.2 kt of CO, 737.3 kt of HC (hydrocarbon), 415.5 kt of primary PM2.5, 61.6 kt of BC (black carbon), 210.3 kt of CH4, and 45.1 kt of N2O in 2021, accounting for 3.2 % of SO2, 14.2 % of NOx, and 2.3 % of CO2 emissions from all global anthropogenic sources, based on the Community Emissions Data System (CEDS). Due to the implementation of fuel-switching policies, global ship emissions of SO2 and primary PM2.5 saw a significant reduction of 81.3 % and 76.5 % in 2021 compared to 2019, respectively. According to the inventory results, the composition of vessel types contributing to global ship emissions remained relatively stable through the years, with container ships consistently contributing ∼ 30 % of global ship emissions. Regarding vessel age distribution, the emission contribution of vessels built before 2000 (without Tier standards) has been declining, dropping to 10.2 % in 2021, suggesting that even a complete phase-out of these vessels would have limited potential for reducing NOx emissions in the short term. On the other hand, the emission contribution of vessels built after 2016 (meeting Tier III standard) kept increasing, reaching 13.3 % in 2021. Temporally, global ship emissions exhibited minimal daily fluctuations. Spatially, high-resolution emission characteristics of different vessel types were delineated. Patterns of ship emission contributions by different types of vessels vary among maritime regions, with container ships predominant in the North and South Pacific, bulk carriers predominant in the South Atlantic, and oil tankers prevalent in the Arabian Sea. The distribution characteristics of ship emissions and intensity also vary significantly across different maritime regions. Our dataset, which is accessible at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10869014 (Wen et al., 2024), provides a daily breakdown by vessel type and age; it is available for broad research purposes, and it will provide a solid data foundation for fine-scale scientific research and shipping emission mitigation."

Validated against multiple networks and datasets, it demonstrated superior accuracy. This dataset is vital for understanding soil moisture dynamics, especially during droughts, and highlights the need for improved modeling of clay soils to refine future predictions. 
 An improved fine-scale soil moisture (SM) dataset at 1-km grid spacing, covering much of the eastern continental U.S., was generated by assimilating 9-km SMAP SM data into the v4.0.1 Noah-MP land surface model. The assimilation, conducted using the Ensemble Kalman Filter algorithm within NASA’s Land Information System, involved 12 ensemble members. The SM analysis for 2016 was fully validated against in-situ observations from four different networks and compared with four other existing datasets. Results indicate that this SM analysis surpasses other datasets in top-layer SM distribution, including a machine learning-based product, despite all SM estimates being less heterogeneous than observed. The analysis of anomalous errors suggests that large similarity in intrinsic errors is likely due to overlapping data sources among the selected SM datasets. By assessing the product using the ARM SGP data, we show that soil temperature and surface heat fluxes are concurrently simulated in good accuracy. A specific investigation into the 2016 southeastern U.S. drought response further indicates drier conditions and higher evapotranspiration estimates compared to GLEAMv4.1. Notably, large errors are associated with grids having clay soil textures, highlighting the need for refined model treatments for specific soil types to further improve SM estimates."

Folkert Boersma;Takashi Sekiya;Kazuyuki Miyazaki;Sander Houweling,Quantifying uncertainties in satellite NO2 superobservations for data assimilation and model evaluation,"Clustering high-resolution satellite observations into superobservations improves model validation and data assimilation applications. In our paper, we derive quantitative uncertainties for satellite NO2 column observations based on knowledge of the retrievals, including a detailed analysis of spatial error correlations and representativity errors. The superobservations and uncertainty estimates are tested in a global chemical data assimilation system and are found to improve the forecasts. 
 Satellite observations of tropospheric trace gases and aerosols are evolving rapidly. Recently launched instruments provide increasingly higher spatial resolutions, with footprint diameters in the range of 2–8 km and with daily global coverage for polar orbiting satellites or hourly observations from geostationary orbits. Often the modelling system has a lower spatial resolution than the satellites used, with a model grid size in the range of 10–100 km. When the resolution mismatch is not properly bridged, the final analysis based on the satellite data may be degraded. Superobservations are averages of individual observations matching the model's resolution and are functional to reduce the data load on the assimilation system. In this paper, we discuss the construction of superobservations, their kernels, and uncertainty estimates. The methodology is applied to nitrogen dioxide tropospheric column measurements of the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) instrument on the Sentinel-5P satellite. In particular, the construction of realistic uncertainties for the superobservations is non-trivial and crucial to obtaining close-to-optimal data assimilation results. We present a detailed methodology to account for the representation error when satellite observations are missing due to, e.g., cloudiness. Furthermore, we account for systematic errors in the retrievals leading to error correlations between nearby individual observations contributing to one superobservation. Correlation information is typically missing from the retrieval products, where an error estimate is provided for individual observations. The various contributions to the uncertainty are analysed from the spectral fitting and the estimate of the stratospheric contribution to the column and the air mass factor for which we find a typical correlation length of 32 km. The method is applied to TROPOMI data but can be generalized to other trace gases such as HCHO, CO, and SO2 and other instruments such as the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS), and the Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of POllution (TEMPO) instrument. The superobservations and uncertainties are tested in the Multi-mOdel Multi-cOnstituent Chemical (MOMO-Chem) data assimilation ensemble Kalman filter system. These are shown to improve forecasts compared to thinning or compared to assuming fully correlated or uncorrelated uncertainties within the superobservation. The use of realistic superobservations within model comparisons and data assimilation in this way aids the quantification of air pollution distributions, emissions, and their impact on climate."

Oxygenated compounds were most prominent, followed by mixed nitrogenated/oxygenated compounds, organic sulfates, and sulfonates. Spectral matching enabled identification or structural annotation of 43 substances, and a workflow involving SIRIUS and MS-DIAL software enabled annotation of 74 unknown per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances with primary source regions in China and the Korean Peninsula.

The O3 to carbon monoxide ratio (ΔO3/ΔCO) increased from 5.32 to 143 ppb ppm–1 as plumes aged from 1 to 480 min, showing a rapid initial increase, doubling in approximately 60 min, followed by a gradual slow down. Residual O3 from daytime fires was detected during the evening and night, disrupting the typical nighttime O3 pattern. The ΔPM2.5 mass/ΔCO ratio ranged from 40.6 to 466 μg m–3 ppm–1. Little age-related change was observed in smoke measured at night with ΔPM2.5 mass/ΔCO levels similar to those observed at the time of emissions (132 μg m–3 ppm–1). However, in plumes of observed O3 enhancement during photochemically active periods (12:00–18:00), ΔPM2.5 mass/ΔCO followed a similar increasing trend as ΔO3/ΔCO, and the two were correlated (r2 = 0.5), although the O3 trend was more pronounced. For these data, a stronger correlation between ΔPM2.5 mass/ΔCO and age was found in plumes of higher PM2.5 concentration (PM2.5 mass > 35 μg m–3). The impact of the prescribed burning season in the southeast was evident in state-operated air quality monitors near burning areas, where PM2.5 mass concentrations were 25–30% higher than nonburning seasons. In contrast, changes in daily maximum 8 h O3 concentrations were less pronounced. Our data indicates that the formation of both O3 and PM2.5 frequently occurred in smoke from prescribed fires during photochemically active periods in the studied regions. These findings are significant, as exposure to O3 and PM2.5 can negatively impact human health."
10.1021/acsestair.4c00173,True,ACS ES&T Air,这篇论文研究了美国野火烟雾对PM2.5暴露的贡献，以及这种暴露在不同种族、收入和居住地人群中的差异。研究使用了2007年至2018年的模型数据，分析了野火烟雾造成的PM2.5浓度，以及与非野火源PM2.5浓度的比较。结果表明，野火烟雾贡献了7%到14%的PM2.5年平均浓度，并且对黑人和美国印第安人/阿拉斯加原住民以及非都市地区居民的PM2.5暴露影响更大。这意味着，卫星遥感和空气质量监测等大气环境遥感技术，可以用来监测野火烟雾的时空分布，从而帮助评估和减轻其对不同人群健康的不均衡影响。  研究关注环境公平问题，指出现有空气污染的不公平分布，并进一步量化了野火烟雾加剧这种不公平的程度。,"['PM2.5', 'air quality', 'wildland fire smoke', 'disproportionate exposure', 'spatial analysis', 'environmental justice', 'air quality monitoring', 'satellite remote sensing']",R. Byron Rice;Jason D. Sacks;Kirk R. Baker;Stephen D. LeDuc;J. Jason West,Wildland Fire Smoke Adds to Disproportionate PM2.5 Exposure in the United States,"Wildland fire (i.e., prescribed fire and wildfire) smoke exposure is an emerging public health threat, in part due to climate change. Previous research has demonstrated disparities in ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure, with Black people, among others, exposed to higher concentrations; yet, it remains unclear how wildland fire smoke may contribute to additional disproportionate exposure. Here, we investigate the additional PM2.5 burden contributed by wildland fire smoke in the contiguous United States by race and ethnicity, urbanicity, median household income, and language spoken at home, using modeled total, non-fire, and fire PM2.5 concentrations from 2007 to 2018. Wildland fires contributed 7% to 14% of total population weighted PM2.5 concentrations annually, while non-fire PM2.5 concentrations declined by 24% over the study period. Wildland fires contributed to greater PM2.5 exposure for Black and American Indian or Alaska Native people and those who live in nonurban areas. Disproportionate mean non-fire PM2.5 concentrations for Black people (9.1 μg/m3, compared to 8.7 μg/m3 overall) were estimated to be further exacerbated by additional disproportionate concentrations from fires (1.0 μg/m3, compared to 0.9 μg/m3 overall). These results can inform equitable strategies by public health agencies and air quality managers to reduce smoke exposure in the United States."

This cohort study aimed to explore the long-term effect of exposure to four air pollutants, including lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), and benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P] on all-cause and cause-specific mortality. This study involved 497,056 participants from the UK Biobank cohort. We used the Cox proportional hazards model to calculate associations. Effects of joint exposure to heavy metals were estimated using  quantile g-computation. Shape of the exposure–response association was examined by fitting penalty splines, in both the total population and subpopulations stratified by age, sex, smoking status, and genetic factors. Modifying effects of age, sex, smoking status, and genetic factors were also examined. Over a median follow-up of 13.7 years, we identified 39,530 (8.0%) deaths. Exposure to mixtures of Pb, Cd, and Hg was associated with 1.040–1.154 times increased risk of all-cause cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, and respiratory disease mortality. Of the specific causes of mortality, Pb and Cd were most strongly associated with respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, followed by ischemic heart disease, CVD, and cancer. Hg and B(a)P seemed to exhibit lower toxicity compared with Pb and Cd. Exposure–response curves demonstrated monotonically increased risk for most mortality outcomes, though Hg was found to be nonlinearly associated with all-cause and stroke mortality. Age, smoking status, and genetic factors were found to modify the susceptibility to heavy metals. Our findings suggested that long-term exposure to heavy metals and B(a)P was monotonically associated with elevated risk of multiple mortality outcomes, indicating there may be no safe threshold for these chemicals. Substantial benefits to public health could be achieved through stringent environmental regulations and clean air initiatives."

Whether and to what extent the horizontal and vertical shifts of vegetation isolines keep pace with the temperature and precipitation isolines, as well as hidden mechanisms remain elusive. Analyzing the greenness and climate data over 1986–2020, our study reveals widespread mismatch, with 76.9% (87.1%) of horizontal greenness isolines lagged or diverged from temperature (precipitation) isolines. Similarly, 55.8% (77.9%) of vertical isolines showed lagging or diverging patterns relative to temperature (precipitation) isolines. Horizontal shifts in vegetation isolines were influenced by slope, precipitation and grazing intensity; while their vertical shifts were primarily driven by water‐related factors that mitigate warming effects. The drivers responsible for asynchronous responses provide predictive understandings of alpine vegetation dynamics under a changing climate."
10.1029/2024GL113406,True,Geophysical Research Letters,这篇论文利用更新后的C‐LSAT数据集（版本2.1）系统评估了自1900年以来全球和大陆尺度上的长期DTR（昼夜温差）变化趋势。研究结果表明，数据覆盖范围的改进（尤其是在2014年之后）以及数据同化，显著提高了全球和区域DTR评估的可靠性。研究发现，自1900年以来，全球平均DTR以每十年−0.025°C的速度下降，其中1950年代至1980年代下降最为显著，亚洲和非洲尤其明显。然而，近几十年来，DTR趋势发生了逆转，自1998年以来，全球DTR以每十年0.136°C的速度增长，欧洲、北美和南半球尤为突出。该研究证实了先前关于DTR趋势及其成因的研究，并提供了更新、可靠的全球和区域变化估计值。虽然文章没有直接提及具体的卫星传感器名称，但其使用的C-LSAT数据集很可能整合了来自不同卫星和地面观测站的温度数据，这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['temperature', 'Diurnal Temperature Range (DTR)', 'climate change', 'satellite remote sensing', 'surface temperature', 'data homogenization', 'spatial heterogeneity']",Qiya Xu;Sihao Wei;Zichen Li;Qingxiang Li,A New Evaluation of Observed Changes in Diurnal Temperature Range,"Due to spatial heterogeneity, the global diurnal temperature range (DTR) change trends vary across data sets. By updating the C‐LSAT data set to version 2.1, this study systematically evaluates long‐term DTR trends at global and continental scales since 1900. The results indicate that improvements in temporal and spatial data coverage, particularly after 2014, along with data homogenization, have significantly enhanced the reliability of global and regional DTR assessments. Since 1900, the global mean DTR has declined at a rate of −0.025°C per decade, with the most pronounced decreases observed from the 1950s to the 1980s, especially in Asia and Africa. However, in recent decades, DTR trends have reversed, with the global DTR increasing at a rate of 0.136°C per decade since 1998, particularly in Europe, North America, and the Southern Hemisphere. These findings confirm previous studies on DTR trends and their causes, providing updated, reliable estimates of global and regional changes."

 Northern ecosystems, encompassing boreal forests, tundra, and permafrost areas, are increasingly affected by the amplified impacts of climate change. These ecosystems play a crucial role in determining the global carbon budget. To improve our understanding of carbon uptake in these regions, we evaluate the effectiveness of employing the physically-based Plant Phenology Index (PPI) to estimate gross primary productivity across ten different ecosystems. Based on eddy-covariance measurements from 65 sites, the vegetation index (VI)-driven GPP models (six different algorithms) are calibrated and validated. Our findings highlight that the Michaelis–Menten algorithm has the best performance and PPI is superior to the other five VIs, including NDVI, NIRv, EVI-2, NDPI, and NDGI, at predicting gross primary productivity (GPP) rates on a weekly scale (with an average R2 of 0.64 and RMSE of 1.70 g C m−2 d−1), regardless of short-term environmental constraints on photosynthesis. Through our scaled-up analysis, we estimate the annual GPP of the vast 37 million km2 study region to be around 22 Pg C yr−1, aligning with other recently developed products such as GOSIF-GPP, FluxSat-GPP, and FLUXCOM-X GPP. Derived from a climate-independent approach, the PPI-GPP product offers distinct advantages in exploring relationships between climate variables and terrestrial ecosystem productivity and phenology. Furthermore, this product holds significant value for assessing forestry and agricultural production in northern regions and for benchmarking terrestrial biosphere models and Earth system models."

 The Canopy Live Fuel Moisture Content (LFMC) is a pivotal factor in wildfire risk assessment within the fire triangle model, representing the ratio of canopy moisture content to its dry weight. Against the backdrop of degraded Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) performance and the underutilization of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) in LFMC inversion, this study harnessed the coupled radiative transfer models (RTMs) to probe the spectral sensitivity of the VIIRS to LFMC and pinpoint the optimal band combination for LFMC inversion. To tackle the challenge of ill-posed inversion, we leveraged the correlation coefficient matrix to mitigate erroneous combinations of free parameters in the construction of the lookup table. Results showcase that VIIRS-based LFMC inversion yields marginally superior accuracy (R2= 0.57, R2= 0.32) for both grassland and forest types, with VIIRS-based inversion demonstrating a lower relative root mean square error (rRMSE = 5.84%), compared to results from the MODIS. By scrutinizing LFMC trends alongside precipitation (PP) data in four forest fires spanning from 2019 to 2022 in southwest China, varied degrees of LFMC decrease preceding fire outbreaks. Those results substantiated the validity of the proposed method for wildfire warning. Consequently, our study asserts the reliability of VIIRS in LFMC inversion, positioning it as a viable substitute and extension of MODIS. VIIRS offers continuous and effective product support for wildfire warning assessment, enhancing our ability to monitor and mitigate wildfire risks."

 Recently, the frequency of heatwaves has increased worldwide, with significant implications for public health, the environment, and socio-economic stability. In densely populated urban areas such as Hong Kong, heatwave events are of particular concern owing to their potential to exacerbate air pollution and modulate weather patterns, including extreme precipitation events. Despite extensive research on these phenomena, there exists a gap in understanding the interconnections of heatwaves, pollution, and extreme precipitation in subtropical urban climates. Utilising in-situ meteorological data from the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO), we investigated the characteristics of heatwaves and explored their impact on pollution and local rainfall. We observed a significant increase in the frequency, intensity, and duration of heatwaves in Hong Kong, particularly after 2010. Synoptic analysis indicates that these heatwaves are often associated with persistent high-pressure systems or tropical cyclones periphery downdrafts, as these patterns could induce subsidence and reduce cloud cover, which contributes to temperature increase. Additionally, heatwaves significantly elevated concentrations of ground-level ozone and particulate matter owing to increased photochemical reactions and stagnant air conditions. These pollution spikes coincide with heatwaves, aggravating public health risks. Furthermore, the increased frequency of heatwaves has altered the composition of local precipitation, with heatwave-following extreme precipitation events occurring more frequently, suggesting a thermal-driven amplification of the hydrological cycle. Our results highlight the urgent need for integrated urban planning and health policies that address the compounding effects of heatwaves, pollution, and subsequent extreme precipitation, underscoring the importance of adapting to and mitigating these linked phenomena amid a changing climate."

The transport of AMFs from the ABL to the polar vortex primarily occurs above 20 km and over timescales exceeding 2 years. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between the polar pollutants and the AMFs from the ABL. About 20 % of SF6 in the polar stratosphere originates from the ABL. 
 The Southeast Asian boundary layer has witnessed alarming pollution levels in recent years, which even affects the trace gas composition in the Southern Hemisphere by inter-hemispheric transport. We use SF6 observations and the Lagrangian chemistry transport model Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS), driven by the ERA5 reanalysis data for the period 2010–2014, to assess the impact of the Asian monsoon (AM) region (15–45° N, 30–120° E) as a significant source of pollutants for the stratosphere, in particular in polar regions. We examine the contribution of transport from the AM region to the Northern Hemisphere polar region (NP) (60–90° N) and to the Southern Hemisphere polar region (SP) (60–90° S). Despite the smaller geographical size of the AM region when compared to the Southern Hemisphere subtropics (15–45° S) and the tropics (15° S–15° N), our findings reveal that the air mass fractions from the AM to the polar regions are approximately 1.5 times larger than the corresponding contributions from the Southern Hemisphere subtropics and only about 2 times smaller than those from the tropics. The transport of air masses from the AM boundary layer to the stratospheric polar vortex primarily occurs above an altitude of about 450 K and over timescales exceeding 2 years. In contrast, transport timescales to the polar regions situated below the vortex are shorter, typically less than about 2 years. Furthermore, the transport contribution from the AM region to the polar regions exhibits distinctive inter-annual variability, significantly influencing the distributions of pollutants. Our analysis of detrended SF6 from an Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier transform spectrometer (ACE-FTS) over the polar regions reveals a strong correlation with the fraction of relatively young air (less than 2 years old) originating from the AM, Southern Hemisphere subtropics, and the tropics. Importantly, our reconstructed SF6 data indicate that approximately 20 % of SF6 in both the northern and southern polar stratosphere originates from the AM boundary layer. The largest fraction of SF6 in the polar stratosphere still originates from the tropical boundary layer, contributing about 50 % of SF6."

Over northern France and Benelux, influenced by anthropogenic aerosols and cloudy conditions, regional evaluation of recent hindcast simulations shows satisfying results and high spatial variability. Future SSR evolution by the end of the century for two contrasting CMIP6 scenarios highlights large decreases in SSR for SSP3-7.0. 
 Investigating the current and future evolution of surface solar radiation (SSR) is essential in the context of climate change and associated environmental issues. We focus on the influence of atmospheric aerosols, along with cloud cover and water vapor content, on northern France and Benelux in spring and summer. Our analysis relies on the National Centre for Meteorological Research–Limited Area Adaptation Dynamic International Development v6.4 (CNRM-ALADIN64) regional climate model at 12.5 km resolution, which includes an interactive aerosol scheme. A regional evaluation of 2010–2020 ALADIN hindcast simulations of clear-sky and all-sky SSR, clear-sky frequency, and aerosols, through comparison to coincident multi-site ground-based measurements, shows reasonable agreement. In addition, these hindcast simulations emphasize how elevated aerosol loads over Benelux and high cloud cover over southwestern England reduce the SSR. Additional ALADIN climate simulations for 2050 and 2100 under Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 1-1.9 predict a significant reduction in aerosol loads compared to 2005–2014, especially over Benelux, associated with future increases in clear-sky SSR but geographically limited all-sky SSR evolution. In contrast, under SSP3-7.0, clear-sky and all-sky SSR is projected to decline significantly over the domain. This decline is greatest in spring over Benelux due to combined increases in cloud cover and nitrate aerosols projected from 2050 onwards. In summer, projected decreases in cloud cover largely attenuate the reduction in SSR due to aerosols in 2050, while by 2100 rising water vapor contents counteract this attenuation. Thus, our results highlight seasonally and spatially variable impacts of future anthropogenic aerosol emissions on SSR evolution due to cloud cover and water vapor modifications that will likely largely contribute to the modulation of forthcoming aerosol influences."

In particular, the spectrometric fluorescence and Raman lidar for atmospheric moisture sensing (RAMSES) at the Lindenberg Meteorological Observatory measured the plume of the strongest Tajogaite eruption of 22–23 September 2021 over northeastern Germany 4 d later. This study provides an analysis of SO2 vertical column density (VCD) and layer height (LH) measurements of the volcanic plume obtained with Sentinel-5 Precursor/TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), which are compared to the observations at several stations across the Canary Islands. Furthermore, a new modeling approach based on TROPOMI SO2 VCD measurements and the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model (HYSPLIT) was developed, which confirmed the link between Tajogaite eruptions and Lindenberg measurements. Modeled mean emission height at the volcanic vent is in excellent agreement with co-located TROPOMI SO2 LH and local lidar ash-height measurements. Finally, a comprehensive discussion of the RAMSES measurements is presented. A new retrieval approach has been developed to estimate the microphysical properties of the volcanic aerosol. For the first time, an optical particle model is utilized that assumes an irregular, non-spheroidal shape of the aerosol particles. According to the analysis, the volcanic aerosol consisted solely of fine-mode inorganic, solid, and irregularly shaped particles – the presence of large aerosol particles or wildfire aerosols could be excluded. The particles likely had an isometric to slightly plate-like shape with an effective half of the particle maximum dimension around 0.1 µm and a refractive index of about 1.51. Moreover, mass column values between 70 and 110 mg m−2, mean mass concentrations of 45–70 µg m−3, and mean mass conversion factors between 0.21 and 0.33 g m−2 at 355 nm were retrieved. Possibly RAMSES observed, at least in part, volcanic secondary sulfate aerosol, which was produced by gas-phase homogeneous reactions during the transport of the air masses from La Palma to Lindenberg."
10.5194/acp-25-1227-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文利用1979年至2019年的再分析数据研究了最低平流层（LMS）的热力学结构的长期变化。研究发现，由于人为气候变化和平流层臭氧的恢复，LMS的热力学结构发生了变化，这同时也表明了大尺度环流的变化。研究重点关注1998年之后的变化，因为这被认为是平流层臭氧开始恢复的时期。研究使用了五种现代再分析资料：ERA5、ERA-Interim、MERRA-2、JRA-55和JRA-3Q，并采用动态线性回归模型进行趋势分析。结果表明，研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是卫星观测和大气成分分析。再分析数据本身就是整合了多种地面观测和卫星观测数据的结果，而研究分析的臭氧、水汽等，都属于大气成分分析的范畴。此外，对平流层和对流层顶的研究也与大气环境遥感技术中的高度信息提取和分析直接相关。,"['stratospheric ozone', 'water vapor', 'tropopause', 'isentropic pressure', 'reanalysis data', 'climate change', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric composition analysis']",Franziska Weyland;Peter Hoor;Daniel Kunkel;Thomas Birner;Felix Plöger;Katharina Turhal,Long-term changes in the thermodynamic structure of the lowermost stratosphere inferred from reanalysis data,"The lowermost stratosphere (LMS) plays an important role in the Earth's climate, containing strong gradients of ozone and water vapor. Our results indicate that the thermodynamic structure of the LMS was changing between 1979–2019 in response to anthropogenic climate change and the recovery of stratospheric ozone, also indicating large-scale circulation changes. We find that both the upper and the lower LMS boundaries show an (upward) trend, which has implications for the LMS mass. 
 The lowermost stratosphere (LMS) plays an important role in stratosphere–troposphere coupling and the Earth's radiation balance. This study investigates the effects of long-term changes in the tropopause and the lower-stratospheric isentropic structure on the mass of the LMS. We compare five modern reanalyses: ERA5, ERA-Interim, MERRA-2, JRA-55 and JRA-3Q. The focus is on changes after 1998, which marks the anticipated beginning of stratospheric ozone recovery. The trend analysis is performed with a dynamic linear regression model (DLM), capable of modeling non-linear trends. According to our study, isentropic pressure in the lower stratosphere (here 380–430 K) shows negative trends in the tropics and positive trends in the extratropics. In the Northern Hemisphere (NH), we find that the extratropical tropopause is rising, accompanied by decreasing pressure at an average rate of −1 hPa per decade. Additionally, our results indicate that the tropical tropopause in the NH has expanded poleward by 0.5° latitude between 1998–2019. In the Southern Hemisphere (SH) extratropics, the lapse rate tropopause shows a downward tendency of up to +2 hPa per decade after 1998, consistent across all reanalyses except JRA-3Q. The tropical tropopause and the cold point is rising, accompanied by decreasing pressure at a rate of ca. −0.5 hPa per decade in all reanalyses. The sign of the tropical tropopause potential temperature trends, however, differs across the reanalyses. This can be attributed to contrasting (absolute) temperature trends in the tropical tropopause region, such as at the 100 hPa pressure level. Consistent with the upward and poleward trend of the NH tropopause, the mass of the LMS decreases by 2 %–3 % for 1998–2019 if a fixed isentrope (380 K) is chosen as the upper LMS boundary. In ERA5, as well as MERRA-2 and ERA-Interim, this mass decline disappears if dynamical upper LMS boundaries are used that take the upward trends of the tropical tropopause into account."

Popular cavity ring-down spectroscopy can provide ultrahigh precision, below 0.01‰, but its accuracy is often worse than 5‰ due to inaccuracies in light intensity measurements. To eliminate this problem, we exploit optical frequency information carried by the ring-down cavity electromagnetic field. Instead of measuring only the decaying light intensity, we perform heterodyne detection of ring-downs followed by Fourier analysis to provide exact frequencies of optical cavity modes and a high-fidelity dispersive spectrum of a gas sample from them. We demonstrate the sub–per-mil accuracy of our method, confirmed by the best ab initio results for CO line intensity and for HD line shape, and the long-term repeatability of our dispersion measurements at 10−4level. We see potential for our approach in atmospheric remote sensing, isotope ratio metrology, thermometry, and establishment of primary gas standards."

While substantial evidence indicates that weather conditions conducive to wildfires will likely become more frequent with higher levels of global warming, changes in extreme fire weather synchronicity remain understudied. Here, we quantify the synchronicity of extreme fire weather in Europe by analysing historical data of the Canadian fire weather index (FWI) from 1981 to 2022 and projecting FWI future scenarios with temperature increases from 1 °C to 6 °C and precipitation changes from −40% to +60%. Our results highlight Central Europe (CEU) as a significant hotspot, with synchronicity increases of up to 389%, while the Mediterranean region could see increases up to 66%. These findings emphasize the growing need for enhanced cross-border coordination and proactive fire management strategies to address the rising likelihood of concurrent extreme fire weather conditions in a warming climate."

In addition to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, one of the primary proposals for counteracting this increase in wildfire danger is a widespread expansion of hazardous fuel reductions. Here, we quantify the potential for fuel reduction to reduce wildfire intensity using empirical relationships derived from historical observations with a novel combination of spatiotemporal resolution (0.375 km, instantaneous) and extent (48 million acres, 9 years). We use machine learning to quantify relationships between sixteen environmental conditions (including ten fuel characteristics and four temperature-affected aridity characteristics) and satellite-observed fire radiative power. We use the derived relationships to create fire intensity potential (FIP) maps for sixty historical weather snapshots at a 2 km and hourly resolution. We then place these weather snapshots in differing background climatological temperature and fuel characteristic conditions to quantify their independent and combined influence on FIP. We find that in order to offset the effect of climate warming under the SSP2-4.5 emissions scenario, fuel reduction would need to be maintained perpetually on ∼3 million acres (or 600 000 acres per year, 1% of our domain, at a 5 year return frequency) by 2050 and ∼8 million acres (or 1.6 million acres per year, 3% of our domain, at a 5 year return frequency) by 2090.

Widespread reductions in anthropogenic emission during COVID-19 lockdowns offer a unique opportunity to understand precipitation responses to changes in anthropogenic aerosols. Based on observations and regional and global climate-chemistry coupled model simulations, we attribute unprecedented precipitation in India during the 2021 lockdown to decreased aerosol levels due to emission reductions. Reduced aerosol loading leads to a northward shift of the subtropical westerly jet, which induces a westward movement of the subtropical southern branch trough and negative sea-level pressure anomalies over the eastern Arabian Sea. This shift facilitates water vapor transport from surrounding oceans to land, increasing precipitation in India by approximately 24.2% in May according to the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry simulations and by 28.5% over the entire lockdown period according to the Community Earth System Model version 2.1.3 simulations. Future projections under the lower aerosol emission scenario indicate an additional enhancement in monsoon precipitation in India. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between aerosol emissions and hydrometeorological dynamics, with implications for understanding future precipitation changes and providing theoretical reference for water resource management."

Stiller;Thomas von Clarmann;Bernd Funke;Sylvia Kellmann;Andrea Linden,Upper-tropospheric pollutants observed by MIPAS: geographic and seasonal variations,"We present global upper-tropospheric distributions of the pollutants HCN, CO, C2H2, C2H6, PAN, and HCOOH, observed between 2002 and 2012 by the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) on the Environmental Satellite (Envisat). By comparing the spatial distributions of their volume mixing ratios and by global correlation and regression analyses, we draw conclusions on their sources, such as biomass burning, anthropogenic sources, and biogenic release. 
 We present a global climatology of upper-tropospheric hydrogen cyanide (HCN), carbon monoxide (CO), acetylene (C2H2), ethane (C2H6), peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), and formic acid (HCOOH) obtained from observations of the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) on board the Environmental Satellite (Envisat) between 2002 and 2012. At northern midlatitudes and high latitudes, the biomass burning tracer HCN, but also CO, PAN, and HCOOH, exhibit maxima during spring and/or summer and minima during winter. On the contrary, maximum northern extratropical C2H2 and C2H6 amounts were measured during winter and spring, and minimum values were measured during summer and fall. In the tropics and subtropics, enhanced amounts of all pollutants were observed during all seasons, especially widespread and up to southern midlatitudes during austral spring. Other characteristic features are eastward transport of anthropogenic C2H6 and of biogenic HCOOH from Central and North America in boreal summer, accumulation of pollutants in the Asian monsoon anticyclone (AMA), and enhanced C2H2 over southeastern Asia in boreal winter. Clear indication of biogenic release of HCOOH was also found above tropical South America and Africa. A global correlation analysis of the other pollutants with HCN corroborates common release by biomass burning as a source of the widespread southern hemispheric pollution during austral spring. Furthermore, high correlation with HCN points to biomass burning as a major source of tropical and subtropical C2H2 and PAN during most of the year. In the northern extratropics, there are generally low correlations with HCN during spring and early summer, indicating the influence of anthropogenic and biogenic sources. However, in August, there are stronger correlations above Siberia and boreal North America, which points to common release by boreal fires. This is confirmed by the respective enhancement ratios (ERs). The ERs measured above northeastern Africa fit well to the emission ratios of the dominant local fire type (savanna burning) for C2H2, while those for CO, C2H6, and HCOOH rather indicate tropical forest fires or additional anthropogenic or biogenic sources. The southern hemispheric ΔC2H6/ΔHCN ERs obtained during August to October are in good agreement with the emission ratio for savanna fires. The same applies for ΔC2H2/ΔHCN in August and for ΔHCN/ΔCO and ΔHCOOH/ΔHCN in October."

The technique offers high-resolution measurements, capturing essential fluctuations in supersaturation necessary for understanding cloud physics. 
 Supersaturation is crucial in cloud physics, determining aerosol activation and influencing cloud droplet size distributions, yet its measurement remains challenging and poorly constrained. This study proposes a theoretical framework to simultaneously observe critical activation diameter and hygroscopicity of activated aerosols through direct measurements of scattering and water-induced scattering enhancement of interstitial and activated aerosols, enabling effective supersaturation measurements. Advanced optical systems based on this framework allow minute- to second-level effective supersaturation measurements, capturing fluctuations vital to cloud microphysics. Although currently limited to clouds with supersaturations below ∼ 0.2 % due to small scattering signals from sub-100 nm aerosols, advancements in optical sensors could extend its applicability. Its suitability for long-term measurements allows for climatological studies of fogs and mountain clouds. When equipped with aerial vehicles, the system could also measure aloft clouds. Therefore, the proposed theory serves as a valuable method for both short-term and long-term cloud microphysics and aerosol–cloud interaction studies."

 Regional PM2.5 transport is an important cause of atmospheric environment change. However, the variations in regional PM2.5 transport on a synoptic scale with meteorological drivers have been incomprehensively understood. Therefore, this study is targeted at the quasi-weekly oscillation (QWO) of regional PM2.5 transport over central and eastern China (CEC) with the influence of synoptic-scale disturbance of the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) circulation. By constructing the data of daily PM2.5 transport flux in CEC in the winters of 2015–2019, we utilize the extended empirical orthogonal function (EEOF) decomposition and other statistical methods to extract the moving spatial distribution of regional PM2.5 transport over CEC, recognizing the QWO in regional PM2.5 transport with the spatial–temporal variations over CEC. The source–receptor relationship in regional transport of PM2.5 is identified with the 2 d lag effect of the North China Plain, as the upwind source region, on the PM2.5 pollution change in the Twain-Hu Basin, as the downwind receptor region in central China. The QWO of regional PM2.5 transport over CEC is regulated by the synoptic-scale disturbance of the EAWM circulation with the periodic activities of the Siberian high. These findings provide new insights into the understanding of regional PM2.5 transport with the source–receptor relationship and the meteorological mechanism in atmospheric environment change."

We define automatic and standard methods and objective criteria for image selection. The wind variability and urban emission budget guide the emission estimation error. Images with low wind variability and high urban emissions account for 47 % of images and give a bias in the emission estimation of −7 % and a spread of 56 %. Other images give a bias of −31 % and a spread of 99 %. 
 There is a growing interest in estimating urban CO2 emission from spaceborne imagery of the CO2 column-average dry-air mole fraction (XCO2). Emission estimation methods have been widely tested and applied to actual or synthetic images. However, there is still a lack of objective criteria for selecting images that are worth processing. This study analyzes the performances of an automated method for estimating urban emissions as a function of the targeted cities and of the atmospheric conditions. It uses synthetic data experiments with synthetic truth and  9920 synthetic satellite images of XCO2 over 31 of the largest cities across the world generated with a global adaptive-mesh model, the Ocean–Land–Atmosphere Model (OLAM), zoomed in at high resolution over these cities. We use a decision tree learning method applied to this ensemble of synthetic images to define criteria based on these emission and atmospheric conditions for the selection of suitable satellite images.We show that our automated method for the emission estimation, based on a Gaussian plume model, manages to produce estimates for 92 % of the synthetic images. Our learning method identifies two criteria, the wind direction's spatial variability and the targeted city's emission budget, that discriminate images whose processing yields reasonable emission estimates from those whose processing yields large errors. Images corresponding to low spatial variability in wind direction (less than 12°) and to high urban emissions (greater than 2.1 kt CO2 h−1) account for 47 % of the images, and their processing yields relative errors in the emission estimates with a median value of −7 % and an interquartile range (IQR) of 56 %. Images corresponding to a high spatial variability in wind direction or to low urban emissions account for 53 % of our images, and their processing yield relative errors in the emission estimates with a median value of −31 % and an IQR of 99 %. Despite such efficient filtering, the accuracy of the estimates corresponding to the former group of images varies widely from city to city."

As PAHs emitted from anthropogenic sources are known to accumulate in urban surface grime present on building exteriors and windows, we hypothesized that PAH-containing wildfire smoke plumes could similarly increase PAH grime loadings. To explore this hypothesis, we coupled analysis of PAHs in grime samples collected from August to November 2021 in two historically smoke-affected Canadian cities, Calgary and Kamloops, with contemporaneous field- and model-based indicators of wildfire influence. In Calgary, a single wildfire smoke day contributed over 20% of total grime PAH loadings during this study’s 3-month sampling period, which implies that wildfire inputs have the potential to dominate the grime composition during a typical wildfire season. In Kamloops, although the PAH congener profile displayed a sustained background wildfire influence, total PAH loadings were dominated by a hyper-local combustion event, which highlights that even small-scale urban combustion activities have the potential to control pollutant loadings on nearby surfaces. In both locations, temporal PAH congener profiles showed no evidence of reactive loss, implying that biomass burning contributes to the presence of a persistent PAH reservoir available for direct exposure or runoff-mediated contamination of downstream environmental compartments."

In this study, we investigated the concentrations and origins of INPs over the western North Pacific to the Arctic Ocean through ship-borne observations conducted in the early autumn of 2016. The number concentrations of INPs (NINPs) active at −25 °C (NINPs(−25 °C)) and −15 °C (NINPs(−15 °C)) varied from 0.034 to 41.2 L–1 and <0.0005 to 0.11 L–1, respectively, and those over the Arctic Ocean (≥70°N) were the lowest. Comparisons of the observed NINPs variation with chemical compositions and autofluorescent properties of ambient aerosol particles indicated that NINPs(−25 °C) and NINPs(−15 °C) were largely influenced by mineral and biological materials of terrestrial origin, respectively. We further observed higher NINPs over the Bering Sea and the Northwestern Pacific (40–60°N) at the return cruise than those at the outward cruise. Aerosol composition and backward trajectory analyses indicated that particles originating from Siberian wildfires could significantly contribute to the observed high NINPs. These results suggest a substantial role of boreal wildfires in supplying INPs onto the oceans, including high latitudes, depending on the transportation and emission conditions."

However, algorithms, sampling strategies, and image quality introduce extra errors due to a lack of reliable references that quantify their effects. To bridge this gap, we employed 314 taxis to monitor NO, NO2, PM2.5, and PM10, and extracted features from ∼382,000 SVIs at multiple angles (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) and buffer radii (100–500 m). Additionally, three typical machine learning algorithms were compared with SVI-based land-used regression (LUR) model to explore their performances. Generally, machine learning methods outperform linear LUR, with the ranking: random forest > XGBoost > neural network > LUR. Averaging strategy is an effective method to avoid bias of insufficient feature capture. Therefore, the optimal sampling strategy is to integrating multiple viewing angles at a 100-m buffer, which achieved absolute errors mostly less than 2.5 μg/m3 or ppb. Besides, overexposure, blur, and underexposure led to image misjudgments and incorrect identifications, causing an overestimation of road features and underestimation of human-activity features. These findings enhance understanding and offer valuable support for developing image-based air quality models and other SVI-related research."

Pusede,Satellite Observations of Atmospheric Ammonia Inequalities Associated with Industrialized Swine Facilities in Eastern North Carolina,"Industrialized swine facilities adversely affect the health and well-being of Eastern North Carolina residents in the U.S. and are an issue of environmental racism. Concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) emit various harmful and noxious air pollutants, including ammonia (NH3). There are limited measurements of CAFO-related air quality, contributing to disputes around its severity. We use NH3 vertical column densities from the space-based Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) to report systematic, distributive inequalities in NH3 column enhancements (ΔNH3 columns), equal to NH3 columns less an observationally determined tropospheric background. Population-weighted block group-scale ΔNH3 columns are higher by 27 ± 3% for Black and African Americans, 35 ± 3% for Hispanics and Latinos, and 49 ± 3% for American Indians compared to non-Hispanic/Latino whites in Eastern North Carolina (April–August 2016–2021). Surface winds and air temperature influence block group-scale NH3 distributions, with higher absolute NH3 inequalities for all groups on calm days and for Black and African Americans and Hispanics and Latinos on hot days, consistent with effects from NH3 volatization downfield of facilities from, e.g., manure-covered fields, particles, and other surfaces. ΔNH3 columns correspond spatially with permitted swine facilities, with residents living multiple kilometers from swine CAFOs chronically exposed to elevated NH3. Trends in NH3 columns over 2008–2023 are driven by regional-scale atmospheric processes rather than localized NH3 changes in CAFO emissions. Results are discussed in local decision-making contexts that have broad relevance for air quality issues without protective federal regulatory standards."

In this study, aqueous solutions of 0.45 μm membrane-filtered PM from 31 major Chinese cities were intravenously administered to rats. Neurotoxicity and mechanisms were investigated by quantifying rat behavior, analyzing  in vivo biomarkers, and examining the PM physicochemical properties. PMs from different cities had variable impacts on rat responses, as manifested by the movement speed of the right ear, particularly at 1 h and 4–6 days postexposure. Physiological mechanisms were linked to the regulation of glucocorticoids via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and miR-107/miR-124 expression in the blood. Additionally, PM toxicity was strongly influenced by particle morphology, size, and zeta potential, which varied greatly across cities. Using random forest and multiple linear regression, we revealed that PM particle sizes (458.67 and 531.17 nm) and PM zeta potentials (−3.78, −17.01, and −20.31 mV) had the most important impacts on rat responsiveness, which was in line with blood biomarkers levels in rats such as Glucocorticoid, IL-1β, and IFN-α. These findings indicate that PMs from 31 cities contribute to varying neurotoxicity, thus presenting a possible differential burden on Alzheimer’s disease in the aging population across many different regions."

However, many studies have focused on individual aldehyde precursors, overlooking the complex composition of organic aerosols, which comprise a diverse mix of organic and inorganic compounds. To address this, a complex BrC system was investigated by generating aqueous atmospheric aerosol mimics containing glyoxal (Gly), glycolaldehyde (GAld), and ammonium sulfate. Structural analysis using supercritical fluid chromatography–mass spectrometry (SFC-MS) showed that adjusting the Gly:GAld mole ratio leads to variations in the composition and abundance of BrC products formed. Notably, aromatic heterocycles (e.g., imidazoles and pyrazines) as well as acyclic carbonyl oligomers were identified to form at different concentrations depending on the Gly:GAld mole ratio. UV–visible spectroscopy analysis demonstrated that light absorption in these mixed Gly + GAld + AS systems cannot be modeled as a simple weighted average of the Gly:GAld mole ratio; observed changes in light absorbance can be explained by compositional changes in solution. These observations indicate that cross-reactions are occurring between the Gly and GAld in solution, potentially leading to changes in the physical properties of the aerosol. Given the thousands of reactive compounds found in atmospheric aerosol, these findings could have important implications for our understanding of organic reactions within the aerosol."

Gristey;Graham Feingold,The Net Radiative Effect of the Ill‐Defined Clear‐Sky in the Vicinity of Clouds,"Clouds play a crucial role in Earth's energy budget resulting in significant deviations from clear‐sky fluxes. This important role, combined with their complexity, makes them a major source of uncertainty in climate projections. Over the past two decades, the radiative signatures of clouds in their surroundings have been extensively studied, highlighting the challenges of defining clouds and distinguishing them from the aerosol embedded in clear‐sky. Accurately defining clouds and aerosol is essential for quantifying their radiative effects and for remote sensing of the surface and atmosphere under clear‐sky conditions. In this study, we combine two of the most mature and sophisticated space‐borne instruments: the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer with its high‐resolution multispectral images and the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System broadband top‐of‐the‐atmosphere radiative flux data. This0 allows us to quantify the net RE of clouds within the clear‐sky around them for the first time. Our findings show that the local RE of clouds over the ocean around noon ranges from −7 to −10 W m−2 ${\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$ in the solar band and 1–1.5 W m−2 ${\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$ in the longwave infrared. These results suggest that clouds drive a significant portion of the aerosol direct RE. Additionally, the near‐cloud longwave infrared effect is equivalent to an effect of ∼ ${\sim} $90 ppm of CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$. We propose to categorize the sky into three regimes—cloudy, cloud‐influenced‐clear‐sky, and far‐field clear‐sky and suggest a path to move beyond a discrete definition of the sky. This will improve our understanding of the role of clouds and aerosol in the climate system, ultimately reducing uncertainties in climate projections."

However, the nonlinear effects and contributions of numerous factors that affect forest fires cannot be disentangled by this model. Using the random forest (RF) model, this study utilized multiple EDVIs and the optical normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as key fuel properties to resolve the physical driving mechanisms of forest fires and to estimate the daily FCs and FRP over East Asia. The results showed that the estimated FCs and FRP were in good agreement with satellite observations, with a spatial R of 0.59 for FCs and 0.63 for FRP and a temporal R of 0.80 for FCs and 0.81 for FRP. The integration of EDVIs and NDVI into the RF model was found to improve model performance and generate overall lower systematic errors than the model without vegetation variables. Model performance was better than that in previous studies using multivariate linear regression models. In addition, EDVIs showed greater importance than NDVI. This was largely due to their daily temporal resolution that allowed EDVIs to capture forest fire dynamics in time. The combination of the RF model with satellite microwave and optical observations shows good performance and has great potential for FC and FRP estimations in global fire danger assessment."

However, its impact on late‐season tropical cyclone genesis (TCG) over the western North Pacific (WNP) remains underexplored. This study investigated the influence of VM on WNP TCG from 1965 to 2020. Significant relationships emerge in interannual (6 year) and decadal (11 year) timescales. On the interannual timescale, VM correlates positively with TCG west of 145°E and negatively to the east. On the decadal timescale, the negative relationship spans the entire WNP. Victoria Mode directly modulates vertical motion and induces low‐latitude anticyclonic circulation across the low‐latitude North Pacific by altering surface wind convergence and diabatic heating. This, in turn, shapes environmental conditions, affecting TCG. Dynamic factors are more important in WNP TCG changes than thermodynamic factors. Critical environmental conditions in VM's impact on TCG include four dynamic factors: relative vorticity, vertical velocity, meridional gradient of zonal wind, and vertical shear of zonal winds. Vertical shear of zonal winds is particularly influential. Distinct correlation patterns and mechanisms are diagnosed between different timescales, attributed to anomalous SST observed over the WNP on the interannual timescale but not on the decadal timescale. Furthermore, this study illustrates the complexity of region‐ and time‐dependent relationships between environmental conditions and TCG. Such dependencies pose challenges for conventional genesis potential index models in accurately capturing the spatial characteristics of the VM‐TCG relationship. Overall, our findings uncover VM's substantial influence on WNP TCG, enhancing understanding of key environmental conditions and mechanisms driving interannual and decadal TCG variations."

 The hurricane, with maximum wind speed over 64 kts, is among the most terrible calamities over the northern Atlantic (NATL). Previous studies identified a poleward migration of tropical cyclone (TC) genesis over the Pacific Ocean, but the shift over the NATL is statistically insignificant. The present study detects a robust southward migration in the genesis latitude of NATL TCs that later reach hurricane strength after 1979, which is consistent with a growth in hurricane frequency in the southern part (10°-20°N) of NATL. This increasing trend of hurricane frequency is intimately attributable to the decreasing vertical shear of zonal wind, resulting from a decreasing north-south temperature gradient. The reduced north-south temperature gradient is primarily caused by greater warming trend in tropospheric temperature in the subtropics, driven by intensified static stability. The present research suggests a potential increase in the hazards confronted by low-latitude islands and coastal nations in Northern America."

 Climate warming has improved conditions for boreal forest growth, yet the region’s fate as a carbon sink of aboveground biomass remains uncertain. Forest height is a powerful predictor of aboveground forest biomass, and access to spatially detailed height-age relationships could improve the understanding of carbon dynamics in this ecosystem. The capacity of land to grow trees, defined in forestry as site index, was estimated by analyzing recent measurements of canopy height against a chronosequence of forest stand age derived from the historical satellite record. Forest-height estimates were then subtracted from the predicted site index to estimate height-age growth potential across the region. Russia, which comprised 73% of the forest change domain, had strong departures from model expectation of 2.4–4.8 ± 3.8 m for the 75th and 90th percentiles.

Significant discrepancies were found, with ERA5 and CMIP6 consistently overestimating sLCC and snowfall frequency. This bias is likely due to cloud microphysics parameterization. This conclusion has implications for accurately representing cloud phase and snowfall in future climate projections. 
 Supercooled liquid-containing clouds (sLCCs) play a significant role in Earth's radiative budget and the hydrological cycle, especially through surface snowfall production. Evaluating state-of-the-art climate models with respect to their ability to simulate the frequency of occurrence of sLCCs and the frequency with which they produce snow is, therefore, critically important. Here, we compare these quantities as derived from satellite observations, reanalysis datasets, and Earth system models from Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) and find significant discrepancies between the datasets for mid- and high latitudes in both hemispheres. Specifically, we find that the ERA5 reanalysis and 10 CMIP6 models consistently overestimate the frequency of sLCCs and snowfall frequencies from sLCCs compared to CloudSat–CALIPSO satellite observations. The biases are very similar for ERA5 and the CMIP6 models, which indicates that the discrepancies in cloud phase and snowfall stem from differences in the representation of cloud microphysics rather than the representation of meteorological conditions. This, in turn, highlights the need for refinements in the models’ parameterizations of cloud microphysics in order for them to represent cloud phase and snowfall accurately. The thermodynamic phase of clouds and precipitation has a strong influence on simulated climate feedbacks and, thus, projections of future climate. Understanding the origin(s) of the biases identified here is, therefore, crucial for improving the overall reliability of climate models."

Karydis,Impact of mineral dust on the global nitrate aerosol direct and indirect radiative effect,"This study investigates the impact of dust on the global radiative effect of nitrate aerosols. The results indicate both positive and negative regional shortwave and longwave radiative effects due to aerosol–radiation interactions and cloud adjustments. The global average net REari and REaci of nitrate aerosols are −0.11 and +0.17 W m−2, respectively, mainly affecting the shortwave spectrum. Sensitivity simulations evaluated the influence of mineral dust composition and emissions on the results. 
 Nitrate (NO3-) aerosol is projected to increase dramatically in the coming decades and may become the dominant inorganic particle species. This is due to the continued strong decrease in SO2 emissions, which is not accompanied by a corresponding decrease in NOx and especially NH3 emissions. Thus, the radiative effect (RE) of NO3- aerosol may become more important than that of SO42- aerosol in the future. The physicochemical interactions of mineral dust particles with gas and aerosol tracers play an important role in influencing the overall RE of dust and non-dust aerosols but can be a major source of uncertainty due to their lack of representation in many global climate models. Therefore, this study investigates how and to what extent dust affects the current global NO3- aerosol radiative effect through both radiation (REari) and cloud interactions (REaci) at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). For this purpose, multiyear simulations nudged towards the observed atmospheric circulation were performed with the global atmospheric chemistry and climate model EMAC, while the thermodynamics of the interactions between inorganic aerosols and mineral dust were simulated with the thermodynamic equilibrium model ISORROPIA-lite. The emission flux of the mineral cations Na+, Ca2+, K+, and Mg2+ is calculated as a fraction of the total aeolian dust emission based on the unique chemical composition of the major deserts worldwide. Our results reveal positive and negative shortwave and longwave radiative effects in different regions of the world via aerosol–radiation interactions and cloud adjustments. Overall, the NO3- aerosol direct effect contributes a global cooling of −0.11 W m−2, driven by fine-mode particle cooling at short wavelengths. Regarding the indirect effect, it is noteworthy that NO3- aerosol exerts a global mean warming of +0.17 W m−2. While the presence of NO3- aerosol enhances the ability of mineral dust particles to act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), it simultaneously inhibits the formation of cloud droplets from the smaller anthropogenic particles. This is due to the coagulation of fine anthropogenic CCN particles with the larger nitrate-coated mineral dust particles, which leads to a reduction in total aerosol number concentration. This mechanism results in an overall reduced cloud albedo effect and is thus attributed as warming."

Health effect studies have focused on whole particulate matter, but compounds responsible for adverse health effects remain uncertain. This study provides the effect of relative humidity and seed aerosol acidity on the chemical composition of aerosol formed from 13BD photooxidation. 
 This study investigated the effect of relative humidity (RH) on the chemical composition of gas and particle phases formed from the photooxidation of 1,3-butadiene (13BD) in the presence of NOx under acidified and non-acidified seed aerosol. The experiments were conducted in a 14.5 m3 smog chamber operated in a steady-state mode. Products were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry. More than 50 oxygenated products were identified, including 33 oxygenated organics, 10 organosulfates (OSs), PAN, APAN, glyoxal, formaldehyde, and acrolein. Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) mass and reaction products formed depended on RH and on the acidity of the seed aerosol. Based on the Extended Aerosol Inorganics Model (E-AIM), the seed aerosol originated from the acidified and non-acidified solutions was found to exist under aqueous and solid phases, respectively. Although the terms “acidified” and “non-acidified” are true for the solutions from which the seeds were atomized, there are far more fundamental differences between the phase states in which species partition to or from (aqueous/solid), which considerably affects their partitioning and formation mechanisms. SOA mass and most SOA products (i) were higher under acidified seed conditions, where the aerosol particles were deliquescent, than under non-acidified seed conditions, where the aerosol particles did not contain any aqueous phase; (ii) increased with the acidity of the aerosol aqueous phase in the experiments under acidified seed conditions; and (iii) decreased with increasing RH. Glyceric acid, threitols, threonic acids, four dimers, three unknowns, and four organosulfates were among the main species measured under either acidified or non-acidified conditions across all RH levels. Total secondary organic carbon and carbon yield decreased with increasing RH under both acidified and non-acidified seed conditions. The photochemical reactivity of 13BD in our systems decreased with increasing RH and was faster under non-acidified than acidified seed conditions. To determine the contribution of 13BD products to ambient aerosol, we analyzed PM2.5 samples collected at three European monitoring stations located in Poland. The occurrence of several 13BD SOA products (e.g., glyceric acid, tartronic acid, threonic acid, tartaric acid, and OSs) in the field samples suggests that 13BD could contribute to ambient aerosol formation."

Walker,Hemispheric asymmetry in recent stratospheric age of air changes,"The transport rate of air in the stratosphere has changed in response to human emissions of greenhouse gases and ozone-depleting substances. This transport rate can be approximated using measurements of long-lived trace gases. We use observations and model results to derive anomalies and trends in the mean rate of stratospheric air transport. We find that air in the Northern Hemisphere aged by up to 0.3 years per decade relative to air in the Southern Hemisphere over 2004–2017. 
 Many stratospheric trace gases, including O3, HCl, and NOy, have had opposing trends in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) compared to the Northern Hemisphere (NH) during the last 2 decades. Some of this difference is due to hemispherically asymmetric changes in the rate of transport by the Brewer–Dobson circulation (BDC), and some is due to ozone depletion and recovery. The mean age of air (AoA) is a common proxy for the transport rate by the BDC in models; however it cannot be directly measured. We use observations from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier transform spectrometer (ACE-FTS) along with results from the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS) to derive AoA anomalies and AoA trends. The AoA is derived using observations of N2O, CH4, and CFC-12, all long-lived trace gases with tropospheric sources. We also consider CLaMS simulations driven with four different reanalyses (ERA5, ERA-Interim, JRA-55, MERRA-2). We find that, irrespective of which trace gas or reanalysis is used, air in the NH aged by up to 0.3 years per decade relative to the SH over 2004–2017. The maximum hemispheric difference in aging occurs in the middle stratosphere, near 30 hPa (∼ 24 km). We also show that the aging rate in the NH becomes smaller when the analysis is extended to 2021. The observed aging in the NH middle stratosphere contradicts model predictions of a decrease in stratospheric AoA in response to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas levels. However, the smaller aging rate during 2004–2021 compared to 2004–2017 provides some evidence that the NH aging is impacted by decadal variability and the limited length of the observation period."

Previous measurements dating back to 2010 have been re-calibrated and an improved optimal estimation retrieval performed on these measurements, giving a 13-year dataset. Measurements made with new and improved instrumental hardware are used to correct previous measurements, which show better agreement than the non-corrected dataset. 
 Long-term observations of water vapour in the middle atmosphere are important for climate studies and predictions, chemical and dynamical process studies, and modelling certain weather events with implications for surface conditions. Measurements from an instrument making middle-atmosphere water vapour observations near Bern, Switzerland – named MIAWARA (MIddle Atmosphere WAter vapour RAdiometer) – have been completely reprocessed since 2010. This has comprised of a new calibration which has been integrated into the framework for the calibration of other University of Bern radiometers and a new retrieval algorithm. The installation of a new spectrometer on the instrument has also allowed the comparison and correction of past observations. We present these corrected measurements and their subsequent analysis against data from Aura's Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS). The comparison shows that the corrected spectra yield more consistent values of water vapour mixing ratio between MIAWARA and Aura MLS, with a lower standard deviation of differences at all heights and a  reduced bias between the two instruments at pressure (height) levels below (above) 0.3 hPa."

UV-328 was added to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, based in part on model calculations indicating atmospheric long-range transport potential. We investigated the atmospheric occurrence of BT-UVs at multiple sites that differ greatly in their proximity to potential sources. UV-P, UV-328, UV-234, UV-326, UV-329, and UV-327 were quantified in active air samples collected in suburban Toronto, on Saturna Island in the Salish Sea, at Point Petre on Lake Ontario, and in Alert, Nunavut, as well as in XAD-resin based passive air samplers deployed at sites in British Columbia and Quebec. As the most volatile BT-UV, UV-P was present in the gas phase across all sampling locations, with higher concentrations in urban areas. The five less volatile BT-UVs were present only in active air samples from suburban Toronto and were not found above detection limits (0.03–1.7 pg·m–3) anywhere else. Empirical evidence thus does not support model predictions of long-range atmospheric transport of particle-bound BT-UVs. Predictions based on simple model calculations should be supported by empirical data if they are to be used as the basis for regulatory decisions."

Our findings reveal that regional estimates substantially understate sea level rise in parts of San Francisco and Los Angeles, projecting more than double the expected rise by 2050. Additionally, temporally variable (nonlinear) VLM, driven by factors such as hydrocarbon and groundwater extraction, can increase uncertainties in 2050 projections by up to 0.4 meters in certain areas of Los Angeles and San Diego.

We show that the inner edge of the habitable zone can now be mapped among exoplanets using their lack of surface water, which, unlike the presence of water, can be unambiguously revealed by atmospheric sulfur species. Using coupled climate-chemistry modeling, we find that the observability of sulfur gases on exoplanets depends critically on the ultraviolet (UV) flux of their host star, a property with wide variation: Most M-dwarfs have a low UV flux and thereby allow the detection of sulfur gases as a tracer of dry planetary surfaces; however, the UV flux of Trappist-1 may be too high for sulfur to disambiguate uninhabitable from habitable surfaces on any of its planets. We generalize this result to show how a population-level search for sulfur chemistry on M-dwarf planets can be used to empirically define the habitable zone in the near future."

First, the sulfur influence mechanisms, including sulfur poisoning and sulfur promotion, as well as the influence of reaction conditions, were discussed to analyze the interaction between SO2 and catalysts and its impact on catalyst properties. Based on the sulfur poisoning process, we further summarized the design strategies of sulfur-resistant catalysts: suppressing the adsorption of SO2 and promoting its desorption, inhibiting the formation of sulfates and facilitating their decomposition, and constructing sacrificial sites, which can be achieved by corresponding design methods: constructing a core–shell/confined structure, dopant modification, and adjusting structural and textural properties. Furthermore, we analyzed feasible catalyst regeneration methods, including N2/O2 atmosphere regeneration, reducing atmosphere-assisted regeneration, and washing regeneration.

Using six-year observation of a simplified version of AMS (i.e., ACSM) in the Paris region along with OA factor data derived from positive matrix factorization analysis, we developed an ensemble machine learning source apportionment model. Compared to individual machine learning algorithms, the ensemble model substantially reduced the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and increased the correlation coefficient in predicting OA sources by approximately 30% and 5%, respectively. Sensitivity analysis with five years of baseline data revealed that model performance relatively stabilizes when the training data exceeds two years, with RMSE values for primary and secondary OA factors at 0.31–0.45 μg/m3 and 0.69–0.84 μg/m3, respectively.

However, the isotopic signatures of NOx emissions from heavy-duty diesel vehicles (HDDVs) remain poorly characterized. In this study, we conducted on-site tests on 18 on-road HDDVs with different emission standards in Shanghai under the condition of China World Transient Vehicle Cycle for trucks (C-WTVC). The average δ15N value under C-WTVC (−5.71 ± 2.60‰) was significantly higher than that in idle mode (−13.85 ± 1.97‰), which is attributed to the lower temperatures in the combustion chamber due to the lower engine output in idle mode, favoring the breakage of the lighter 14N14N molecules. The δ15N-NOx values under C-WTVC were significantly lower than those in driving mode in the United States, suggesting that δ15N values may be localized in isotope-based NOx source analysis. NOx emissions were reduced considerably with the upgrade of emission standards while δ15N-NOx levels showed an opposite trend. The NH3-selective catalytic reduction (SCR) reduced automobile NOx emissions by more than 50% and significantly enriched 15N relative to diesel-generated NOx. Indicated by the correlations between NOx emissions, δ15N-NOx, and cumulative mileage, the SCR de-NOx efficiency decreased linearly with the increase of cumulative mileage. Our results suggest that the routine maintenance and mandatory inspection of aged SCR systems should be strengthened. The distribution of provincial δ15N-NOx values of diesel vehicle emissions was established based on a weighted average model. The contribution of vehicle NOx emissions in typical megacities in China has been revisited by upgrading the δ15N-NOx values of diesel vehicles, demonstrating that the application of regional δ15N-NOx values of diesel vehicles can narrow the gap between isotope-based analysis and emission inventory. This study will enrich the NOx isotopic fingerprint database in China and minimize the uncertainty in isotope-based NOx source apportionment, helping to formulate air pollution prevention and control strategies."

The modeled W $W$ is forced by the spectrally integrated whitecap dissipation source function in the European Center for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts spectral wave model, ecWAM. Without tuning, best agreement is found for mature sea states, with an average modeled to measured W $W$ ratio of 0.87. This ratio approaches unity with the introduction of a dissipation rate threshold value and an explicit wave‐age dependence. The study suggests that accurate estimates of W $W$ can be routinely produced by ecWAM and opens new opportunities to model bubble‐mediated fluxes of CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ and sea spray aerosol with ecWAM."

 Marine net primary production supports critical ecosystem services and the carbon cycle. However, the lack of consensus in the direction and magnitude of projected change in net primary production from models undermines efforts to assess climate impacts on marine ecosystems with confidence. Here we use contemporary remote sensing net primary production trends (1998–2023) from six remote sensing algorithms to discriminate amongst fifteen divergent model projections. A model ranking scheme, based on the similarity of linear responses of net primary production to changes in sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a and the mixed layer, finds that future declines in net primary production are more likely than presently predicted. Even the best ranking models still underestimate the sensitivity of declines in net primary production to ocean warming, suggesting shortcomings remain. Reproducing this greater temperature sensitivity may lead to even larger declines in future net primary production than presently considered for impact assessment. Earth system models underestimate the decline in net primary productivity associated with ocean warming, meaning future net primary productivity decline is more likely than currently estimated, according to a ranking of Earth system models using remote sensing data."

A pronounced warming over the tropical Atlantic and a moderate cooling over the equatorial Pacific have driven an adjustment of moisture transport and thus snowfall pattern in West Antarctica. Our study reveals a centennial tropical-polar teleconnection, producing long-term trends with opposing changes across the regions.

Distance variations between the two GRACE‐FO satellites, recorded by a K‐Band Ranging system and a new Laser Ranging Interferometer (LRI), are significantly influenced by atmospheric mass redistribution. We investigate whether the sub‐monthly variations in atmospheric water mass, precipitation, and changes in total water storage during the extreme flood event in western Europe in 2021 were sufficiently large to influence the satellite gravity field measurements, if the GRACE‐FO satellites would have passed directly over the region. We use several data sets such as weather forecasts (ICON‐D2 model), hydrological simulations (ParFlow/CLM), observations as well as reanalyses, showing the high uncertainty between different estimations of the considered variables: total precipitable water, total precipitation, and total water storage. Our estimates suggest a potentially noticeable impact of the 2021 flood event on the GRACE‐FO satellites. Although it was globally seen a rather small event, even the atmospheric water mass beyond water vapor, which is not considered within the de‐aliasing process, is close to the LRI detection accuracy. This is particularly relevant for future gravity missions, which will use the LRI with potentially higher sensitivity as their main instrument. Sub‐monthly variations in the total atmospheric water mass, that is, beyond water vapor of huge extreme precipitation events should be investigated further to reduce potential future aliasing errors."

Deposition, biogenic emissions, and extra-regional sources have been playing increasingly important roles in controlling pollutant budgets in this area as local anthropogenic emissions drop. 
 This study describes the application of a regional Earth system model with updated parameterizations for selected land–atmosphere exchange processes and multiplatform, multidisciplinary observations. We estimate reactive nitrogen (Nr = NOy+ NHx) emissions from various sources, surface and column nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and total and speciated Nr dry and wet deposition during 2018–2023 over the northeastern and mid-Atlantic US where nitrogen-oxide-limited or transitional chemical regimes dominate. The estimated Nr concentrations and deposition fluxes are related to ozone (O3) in terms of spatiotemporal variability and its key drivers as well as possible ecosystem impacts. Modeled surface O3 persistently agrees well with observations, with root mean square errors staying within 4–7 ppbv for individual years in May–June–July. Model-based surface O3–NO2 column correlation, which shows a dependency on column  formaldehyde / NO2, is higher in 2020 (r=0.62) than in other years (r=0.47–0.56). Ozone vegetative uptake overall dropped by ∼10 % from 2018 to 2023, displaying clearer downward temporal changes than total Nr deposition as declining NOy emission and deposition competed with increasing NHx fluxes. It is highlighted that temporal variabilities of Nr and O3 concentrations and fluxes on subregional to local scales respond to hydrological variability that can be influenced by precipitation and controllable human activities like irrigation. Deposition and biogenic emissions that are highly sensitive to interconnected environmental and plant physiological conditions, plus extra-regional sources (e.g., O3-rich stratospheric air and dense wildfire plumes from upwind regions), have been playing increasingly important roles in controlling pollutant budgets as local emissions decline owing to effective emission regulations and COVID lockdowns."

Zelinka;Li-Wei Chao;Timothy A. Myers;Yi Qin;Stephen A. Klein,Technical note: Recommendations for diagnosing cloud feedbacks and rapid cloud adjustments using cloud radiative kernels,"Clouds lie at the heart of uncertainty in both climate sensitivity and radiative forcing, making it imperative to properly diagnose their radiative effects. Here we provide a recommended methodology and code base for the community to use in performing such diagnoses using cloud radiative kernels. We show that properly accounting for changes in obscuration of lower-level clouds by upper-level clouds is important for accurate diagnosis and attribution of cloud feedbacks and adjustments. 
 The cloud radiative kernel method is a popular approach to quantify cloud feedbacks and rapid cloud adjustments to increased CO2 concentrations and to partition contributions from changes in cloud amount, altitude, and optical depth. However, because this method relies on cloud property histograms derived from passive satellite sensors or produced by passive satellite simulators in models, changes in obscuration of lower-level clouds by upper-level clouds can cause apparent low-cloud feedbacks and adjustments, even in the absence of changes in lower-level cloud properties. Here, we provide a methodology for properly diagnosing the impact of changing obscuration on cloud feedbacks and adjustments and quantify these effects across climate models.  Averaged globally and across global climate models, properly accounting for obscuration leads to weaker positive feedbacks from lower-level clouds and stronger positive feedbacks from upper-level clouds while simultaneously removing a mostly artificial anti-correlation between them. Given that the methodology for diagnosing cloud feedbacks and adjustments using cloud radiative kernels has evolved over several papers, and obscuration effects have only occasionally been considered in recent papers, this paper serves to establish recommended best practices and to provide a corresponding code base for community use."

Wexler;Ann M. Dillner,A novel methodology for assessing the hygroscopicity of aerosol filter samples,"Quantifying the composition-dependent hygroscopicity of aerosol particles is essential for advancing our understanding of atmospheric processes. Existing methods do not integrate chemical composition with hygroscopicity. We developed a novel method to assess the water uptake of particles sampled on aerosol filters at relative humidity levels up to 97 % and link it with their composition. This approach allows for the separation of total water uptake into inorganic and organic components. 
 Due to US regulations, concentrations of hygroscopic inorganic sulfate and nitrate have declined in recent years, leading to an increased importance of the hygroscopic nature of organic matter (OM). The hygroscopicity of OM is poorly characterized because only a fraction of the multitude of organic compounds in the atmosphere is readily measured, and there is limited information on their hygroscopic behaviors. Hygroscopicity of aerosol is traditionally measured using a humidified tandem differential mobility analyzer (HTDMA) or electrodynamic balance (EDB). EDB measures water uptake by a single particle. For ambient and chamber studies, HTDMA measurements provide water uptake and particle size information but not chemical composition. To fill this information gap, we developed a novel methodology to assess the water uptake by particles collected on Teflon filters. This method uses the same filter sample for both hygroscopicity measurements and chemical characterization, thereby providing an opportunity to link the measured hygroscopicity with ambient particle composition. To test the method, hygroscopic measurements were conducted in the laboratory for ammonium sulfate, sodium chloride, glucose, and malonic acid, which were collected on 25 mm Teflon filters using an aerosol generator and sampler. Constant-humidity solutions (CHSs), including potassium chloride, barium chloride dihydrate, and potassium sulfate, were employed in a saturated form to maintain the relative humidity (RH) at approximately 84 %, 90 %, and 97 % in small chambers. Our preliminary experiments revealed that, without the pouch, water uptake measurements were not feasible due to rapid water loss during weighing. Additionally, we observed some absorption by the aluminum pouch itself. To account for this, concurrent measurements were conducted for both the loaded and the blank filters at each RH level. Thus, the dry loaded and blank Teflon filters were placed in aluminum pouches with one side open and in RH-controlled chambers for more than 24 h. The wet loaded samples and wet blanks were then weighed using an ultramicrobalance to determine the water uptake by the respective compound and the blank Teflon filter. The net amount of water absorbed by each compound was calculated by subtracting the water uptake of the blank filter from that of the wet loaded filter. Hygroscopic parameters, including the water-to-solute (W / S) ratio, molality, mass fraction solute (mfs), and growth factors (GFs), were calculated from the measurements. The results obtained are consistent with those reported by the Extended Aerosol Inorganics Model (E-AIM) and previous studies utilizing HTDMA and EDB for these compounds, highlighting the accuracy of this new methodology. This new approach enables the hygroscopicity and chemical composition of individual filter samples to be assessed so that in complex mixtures, such as chamber and ambient samples, the total water uptake can be parsed between the inorganic and organic components of the aerosol."

A new version of these data products has recently been released; however, these new products must be validated against other datasets to ensure their validity. This study presents such an assessment, using measurements from 11 satellite instruments to characterize the new MAESTRO products. In the stratosphere, good agreement is found for ozone and acceptable agreement is found for NO2 with these other datasets. 
 Launched aboard the Canadian SCISAT satellite in August 2003, the Measurement of Aerosol Extinction in the Stratosphere and Troposphere Retrieved by Occultation (MAESTRO) instrument has been measuring solar absorption spectra in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible part of the spectrum for more than 20 years. The UV-channel measurements from MAESTRO are used to retrieve   profiles of  ozone from the short-wavelength end of the Chappuis band (UV-ozone) and NO2, while measurements made in the visible part of the spectrum are used to retrieve a separate ozone (Vis-ozone) product. The latest  ozone and NO2 profile products, version 4.5, have been released, and they initially cover the period from February 2004 to December 2023, although they will continue to be updated. The version 4.5 retrieval algorithm represents an improvement from previous versions, with changes including updated pressure and temperature input information, an improved algorithm for high-Sun reference spectrum calculation, improved Rayleigh scattering modelling, and the change to a Twomey–Tikhonov inversion algorithm from a Chahine relaxation technique. Due to the buildup of an unknown contaminant, the UV-ozone and NO2 products are only viable  up to June 2009 for NO2 and December 2009 for UV-ozone. This study presents comparisons of the version 4.5 MAESTRO ozone and NO2 measurements with coincident (both spatially and temporally) measurements from an ensemble of 11 other satellite limb-viewing instruments. In the stratosphere, the Vis-ozone product was found to possess a small high bias, with stratosphere-averaged relative differences between 2.3 % and 8.2 %, although good agreement with the comparison datasets was found overall. A similar bias, albeit with slightly poorer agreement, is found for the UV-ozone product in the stratosphere, with the average stratospheric agreement  between MAESTRO and the other datasets ranging from 2.8 % to 11.9 %. For NO2, general agreement with the comparison datasets is only found in the range from 20 to 40 km. Within this range, MAESTRO is found to have a low bias for NO2, and most of the datasets agree to within 27.2 %, although the average agreement ranges from 8.5 % to 43.4 %."

10.5194/gmd-18-585-2025,True,Geoscientific Model Development,这篇论文研究的是改进WRF-Chem气象化学模式中气溶胶辐射相互作用的算法。研究者开发了一种更精确的算法（“Resolved”算法），能够在所有14个短波波段计算气溶胶光学特性，而原始算法（“Interpolated”算法）只使用4个波段，并进行插值。结果表明，新的算法显著改变了模拟的气溶胶特性及其辐射效应，特别是对沙尘气溶胶的影响更为明显。改进后的算法模拟的沙尘辐射强迫是原始算法的两倍左右，并且与以往研究结果更一致。这种算法的改进也导致了气象场的变化，例如近地表温度、风场和行星边界层高度等。总体来说，这项研究关注的是改进大气模式中气溶胶辐射过程的模拟精度，这对于更准确地模拟和预测空气质量、气候变化等具有重要意义。虽然论文没有直接提及具体的遥感技术或卫星观测数据，但其改进的模拟结果可以为解释卫星观测数据和评估空气质量提供更可靠的依据，因此与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['Aerosol', 'Radiation', 'WRF-Chem', 'Air quality', 'Radiative forcing', 'Satellite observation (implied)', 'Atmospheric composition', 'Modeling']",Jiawang Feng;Chun Zhao;Qiuyan Du;Zining Yang;Chen Jin,Amending the algorithm of aerosol–radiation interactions in WRF-Chem (v4.4),"In this study, we improved the calculation of how aerosols in the air interact with radiation in WRF-Chem. The original model used a simplified method, but we developed a more accurate approach. We found that this method significantly changes the properties of the estimated aerosols and their effects on radiation, especially for dust aerosols. It also impacts the simulated weather conditions. Our work highlights the importance of correctly representing aerosol–radiation interactions in models. 
 WRF-Chem (Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry) is widely used to assess regional aerosol radiative feedback. However, in the current version, aerosol optical properties are only calculated in four shortwave bands, while only two of them are used to interpolate optical properties towards the 14 shortwave bands used in the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for Global Climate Models (RRTMG) scheme. In this study, we use a “Resolved” algorithm to estimate aerosol radiative feedback in WRF-Chem, in which aerosol optical properties are calculated in all 14 shortwave bands. The impacts of changing this calculation algorithm are then evaluated. The simulation results of aerosol optical properties are quite different using the new Resolved algorithm, especially for dust aerosols. The alteration of aerosol optical properties results in considerably different aerosol radiative effects: the dust radiative forcing in the atmosphere simulated by the Resolved algorithm is about 2 times larger than the original “Interpolated” algorithm. The dust radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) simulated by the Interpolated algorithm is negative in the Sahara region, while the Resolved algorithm simulates positive forcing at TOA and can exceed 10 W m−2 in the Sahara, which is more consistent with previous studies. The modification also leads to changes in meteorological fields due to alterations in radiative feedback effects of aerosols. The near-surface temperature is changed due to the difference in the radiation budget at the bottom of the atmosphere (BOT) and the heating effects of aerosols at the surface. Furthermore, the amendment of the algorithm partially corrects the wind field and temperature simulation bias compared to the reanalysis data. The difference in planet boundary layer height can reach up to ∼100 m in China and ∼200 m in the Sahara, which also results in a greater surface haze. The results show that correcting the estimation algorithm of aerosol radiative effects is necessary in WRF-Chem."

Here, we conducted a field campaign with measurements of H2O2 and related species at a tower-based site (∼528 m above the ground surface) of Beijing in spring of 2022. The observed hourly H2O2 concentration reached up to 21.2 ppbv with an average value of 3.4 ± 3.7 ppbv during the entire observation period, which was higher than values from previous observations throughout the world. The H2O2 budget revealed that the two known sources (self-reaction of HO2 radicals and ozonolysis of alkenes) could not account for the significant formation of H2O2, leading to a considerable unknown source strength (∼0.14–0.53 ppbv h–1) of H2O2 at noon and after sunset. Based on the levoglucosan signal, distribution of fire points, and backward trajectories, biomass burning emissions from the southwest of Beijing (e.g., North China Plain) were found to contribute greatly to H2O2 formation. Besides, photochemical aging of PM2.5 might also have a potential impact on H2O2 production at noon. The unexpectedly high concentrations of H2O2 aloft made a vital contribution to sulfate production (0.2–1.1 μg m–3 h–1), which could be transported to the ground surface during the turbulent mixing. Our findings provide an improved understanding of the H2O2 chemistry in the boundary layer aloft in a megacity, as well as its impact on sulfate formation."

This study uses 20 years of MODIS satellite observations to upscale isoprene production and loss rates derived from laboratory experiments, enabling global modeling of aqueous isoprene concentrations and emissions. Earth system model simulations with integrated marine isoprene emissions demonstrate substantial alterations in atmospheric composition over global oceanic regions. Our investigation uncovers diurnal variations in the vertical profiles of atmospheric isoprene, indicating that surface isoprene can ascend to the mid-to-upper troposphere, where nitrogen monoxide (NO) influences isoprene epoxydiol (IEPOX) production differently over selected oceanic and terrestrial regions. These findings pave the way for future studies on the role of marine isoprene in climate models and advance our understanding of its broader implications for atmospheric chemistry under a changing climate."

We employed a high-resolution particle size magnifier-scanning mobility particle sizer (PSMPS) and a proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS) for real-time monitoring of indoor atmospheric nanoparticle size distributions and terpene mixing ratios, respectively. Our findings reveal that terpenes released from scented wax melts react with indoor atmospheric ozone (O3) to initiate new particle formation (NPF) events, resulting in significant indoor atmospheric nanoparticle concentrations (>106 cm–3) comparable to those emitted by combustion-based scented candles, gas stoves, diesel engines, and natural gas engines. We show that scented wax melt-initiated NPF events can result in significant respiratory exposures, with nanoparticle respiratory tract deposited dose rates similar to those determined for combustion-based sources.

Perring,Black Carbon Reflects Extremely Efficient Aerosol Wet Removal in Monsoonal Convective Transport,"Refractory black carbon (rBC) is a primary aerosol species, produced through incomplete combustion, that absorbs sunlight and contributes to positive radiative forcing. The overall climate effect of rBC depends on its spatial distribution and atmospheric lifetime, both of which are impacted by the efficiency with which rBC is transported or removed by convective systems. These processes are poorly constrained by observations. It is especially interesting to investigate rBC transport efficiency through the Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM) since this meteorological pattern delivers vast quantities of boundary layer air from Asia, where rBC emissions are high to the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UT/LS) where the lifetime of rBC is expected to be long. Here, we present in situ observations of rBC made during the Asian Summer Monsoon Chemistry and Climate Impact Project of summer, 2022. We use observed relationships between rBC and CO in ASM outflow to show that rBC is removed nearly completely (>98%) from uplifted air and that rBC concentrations in ASM outflow are statistically indistinguishable from the UT/LS background. We compare observed rBC and CO concentrations to those expected based on two chemical transport models and find that the models reproduce CO to within a factor of 2 at all altitudes whereas rBC is overpredicted by a factor of 20–100 at altitudes associated with ASM outflow. We find that the rBC particles in recently convected air have thinner coatings than those found in the UTLS background, suggesting transport of a small number of rBC particles that are negligible for concentration."

Nonetheless, due to complications that have both to do with the complexity of the source and required equipment, this has only been done in a few studies to date. Here we report on the design and implementation of an instrument to perform simultaneous, multi‐band optical and radio observations of lightning, which aims to provide a fast and simple way to routinely measure its temperature. The primary instrument includes photometers to measure temperature and electric field sensors to identify lightning sub‐processes. Data are analyzed in tandem with 2D and 3D lightning location information. To measure the temperature, the photometer array includes 3 channels equipped with narrowband filters (1 nm) centered at bright atomic oxygen lines in the near‐infrared, and temperature is given from the relative intensity of optical emissions across the 3 channels. We found the average peak temperature of 44 negative cloud‐to‐ground lightning return strokes to be 17,600 K. Additionally, the peak temperature had no apparent correlation to the peak current. Comparisons between 777 nm observations from the ground and from space by the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) emphasize the picture that the instruments in these two vantage points tend to see different portions of the lightning flash.

Li,The Contrasting Roles of Land and Oceanic Moisture Contributions to Summer Rainfall Over the Southeastern United States,"Summer precipitation in the Southeast United States (SEUS) is classified into three categories—light, moderate, and heavy—using a Bayesian statistical model. We find that heavy rainfall events explain most of the interannual variance of summertime cumulative precipitation in the region, influencing regional hydroclimate patterns. For each rainfall category, we track the respective moisture sources using the 2‐Layers Water Accounting Model driven by reanalysis data. We find that the Atlantic Ocean is the primary moisture source across all rainfall categories and becomes more important with increasing rainfall intensity. Conversely, land moisture contributions decrease with rainfall intensity. In the case of heavy rainfall, the moisture originating from the Atlantic Ocean is transported to the SEUS via a southeastward positioning of the North Atlantic Subtropical High (NASH) Western Ridge. The ample supply of moisture fluxes is further propelled by reduced surface pressure which promotes ascending motion in the SEUS. Analysis of mid‐troposphere circulation indicates that this anomalous low‐pressure might stem from wave trains originating over the North Pacific Ocean. Thus, heavy rainfall events involve increased Atlantic Ocean moisture fluxes directed by the NASH to the SEUS, which, in turn, is modulated by anomalous atmospheric circulation produced over the Pacific Ocean. Furthermore, we observe that the heavy and moderate (light) rainfall event frequency has increased (decreased) by five days throughout the 1970–2019 analysis period."

 In recent years, numerous studies have explored the relationship between atmospheric conditions and respiratory viral infections. However, these investigations have faced certain limitations, such as the use of modestly sized datasets, a restricted geographical focus, and an emphasis on a limited number of respiratory pathogens. This study aimed to develop a nationwide respiratory virus infection risk prediction model through machine learning approach. We utilized the CRFC algorithm, a random forest-based method for multi-label classification, to predict the presence of various respiratory viruses. The model integrated binary classification outcomes for each virus category and incorporated air quality and meteorological data to enhance its accuracy. The data was collected from 31 regions in China between 2016 and 2021, encompassing pathogen detection, air quality indices, and meteorological measurements. The model’s performance was evaluated using ROC curves, AUC scores, and precision-recall curves. Our model demonstrated robust performance across various metrics, with an average overall accuracy of 0.76, macro sensitivity of 0.75, macro precision of 0.77, and an average AUC score of 0.9. The SHAP framework was employed to interpret the model’s predictions, revealing significant contributions from parameters such as age, NO2 levels, and meteorological conditions. Our model provides a reliable tool for predicting respiratory virus risks, with a comprehensive integration of environmental and clinical data. The model’s performance metrics indicate its potential utility in clinical decision-making and public health planning. Future work will focus on refining the model and expanding its applicability to diverse populations and settings."

TCR is highly correlated with near-term climate projections, and thus of relevance for climate policy, but remains poorly constrained in part due to uncertainties in the representation of key physical processes in Earth System Models (ESMs). Within state-of-the-art ESMs participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), the TCR range (1.1 ∘C–2.9 ∘C) is too wide to offer useful guidance to policymakers. Similarly, the sixth report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, while not solely reliant on ESMs for its TCR assessment, produced a very likely range of 1.2 ∘C–2.4 ∘C. To complement earlier, ESM-based, estimates, we here present a new TCR estimate of 2.17 (1.72–2.77) ∘C (95% confidence interval), derived based on a statistical relationship between surface air temperature and observational proxies for its main drivers, i.e. changes in atmospheric greenhouse gases and aerosols. We show that, within uncertainty, this method correctly diagnoses TCR from 20 CMIP6 ESMs if the same input variables are taken from the ESMs that are available from observations. This increases confidence in the new observation-based central estimate and range, which is respectively higher and narrower than the mean and spread of the estimates from the entire ensemble of CMIP6. Many ESM-based estimates tend to produce TCRs lower than the observational range reported here. Our findings suggest that a misrepresentation of the aerosol cooling effect could be the cause of this discrepancy. Further, the revised TCR estimate suggests a downward revision of the remaining carbon budgets aligned with the overarching goal of the Paris agreement."

This study quantitatively describes two distinct coupled patterns between autumn Arctic sea ice concentration in the Barents–Kara seas and the subsequent winter regional temperature over Eurasia. The leading coupled pattern dominantly depicts interannual variations of the cold Arctic―warm Eurasia or warm Arctic—cold Eurasia configuration, differing from the background warming pattern. While the second coupled pattern describes in-phase interannual variations of winter temperature over the Arctic and across much of Eurasia. This second pattern displayed an interdecadal transition in the early 2010s, from frequent occurrences of the cold Arctic―cold Eurasia pattern to the dominant warm Arctic―warm Eurasia configuration. Through this interdecadal transition, the warm Arctic―warm Eurasia configuration replaced the leading coupled pattern. The previously proposed the tropospheric and stratospheric processes cannot fully explain this Arctic―Eurasia temperature configuration. These findings underscore the pivotal role of Arctic sea ice melting in influencing the interannual and interdecadal variations of winter atmospheric circulation patterns and have significant implications for predicting short-term winter temperature trends over Eurasia."

High uncertainties in the bottom–up estimates of wetland CH4 emissions pose significant challenges for accurately understanding their spatiotemporal variations, and for the scientific community to monitor wetland CH4 emissions from space. In fact, there are large disagreements between bottom–up estimates versus top–down estimates inferred from inversion of atmospheric CH4 concentrations. To address these critical gaps, we review recent development, validation, and applications of bottom–up estimates of global wetland CH4 emissions, as well as how they are used in top–down inversions. These bottom–up estimates, using (1) empirical biogeochemical modeling (e.g. WetCHARTs: 125–208 TgCH4 yr−1); (2) process-based biogeochemical modeling (e.g. WETCHIMP: 190 ± 39 TgCH4 yr−1); and (3) data-driven machine learning approach (e.g. UpCH4: 146 ± 43 TgCH4 yr−1). Bottom–up estimates are subject to significant uncertainties (∼80 Tg CH4 yr−1), and the ranges of different estimates do not overlap, further amplifying the overall uncertainty when combining multiple data products. These substantial uncertainties highlight gaps in our understanding of wetland CH4 biogeochemistry and wetland inundation dynamics. Major tropical and arctic wetland complexes are regional hotspots of CH4 emissions. However, the scarcity of satellite data over the tropics and northern high latitudes offer limited information for top–down inversions to improve bottom–up estimates. Recent advances in surface measurements of CH4 fluxes (e.g. FLUXNET-CH4) across a wide range of ecosystems including bogs, fens, marshes, and forest swamps provide an unprecedented opportunity to improve existing bottom–up estimates of wetland CH4 estimates. We suggest that continuous long-term surface measurements at representative wetlands, high fidelity wetland mapping, combined with an appropriate modeling framework, will be needed to significantly improve global estimates of wetland CH4 emissions. There is also a pressing unmet need for fine-resolution and high-precision satellite CH4 observations directed at wetlands."

Strikingly, despite Idalia’s moderate intensity and favorable vortex structure, neither upper ocean thermal energy nor environmental vertical wind shear conditions were as favorable during its intensification from Category 2 to Category 4 as earlier in its path, raising the question of what external factors contributed to its extreme intensification during this phase. Using satellite data, underwater glider observations, and numerical model outputs, this study reveals that, in addition to the 2023 marine heatwave, an extensive riverine plume in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, extending from the Mississippi-Alabama-Florida shelf to the Straits of Florida, produced a ∼20 m thick low-salinity layer (∼34–34.5 psu) and a corresponding warm upper ocean (>29 °C, ∼25–30 m thick). This defined a 10–20 m thick strongly stratified barrier layer below the surface layer with buoyancy frequencies exceeding 10−3 s−1 that suppresses vertical mixing and became a critical factor contributing to Idalia’s rapid intensification under the relatively less than favorable thermal and wind field environments. Therefore, incorporating the river plume in future forecast models appears to be essential to improve the accuracy of intensity predictions, especially in the areas affected by the plume, where stratification plays an important role in the intensification dynamics."
10.5194/acp-25-1513-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了美国石油和天然气行业甲烷排放的构成。它发现，尽管高排放设施（超级排放源）备受关注，但大量的低排放设施共同贡献了大部分的甲烷排放总量。研究使用了多种方法收集数据，包括地面实测和多种航空/卫星遥感技术（例如MethaneAIR，Bridger Gas Mapping LiDAR，AVIRIS-NG和全球航空观测站），以获得更全面的排放清单。研究结果强调，要有效减少石油和天然气行业的甲烷排放，必须同时关注高排放和低排放设施，不能仅仅关注超级排放源。 这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为研究中使用了多种遥感技术来监测和量化甲烷排放，这属于大气成分分析和空气质量监测的范畴。,"['methane', 'satellite remote sensing', 'aerial remote sensing', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'emission monitoring', 'oil and gas', 'methane emissions']",James P.

Hamburg;Ritesh Gautam,Small emission sources in aggregate disproportionately account for a large majority of total methane emissions from the US oil and gas sector,"We utilize peer-reviewed facility-level oil and gas methane emission rate data gathered in prior work to estimate the relative contributions of methane sources emitting at different emission rates in the United States. We find that the majority of total methane emissions in the US oil and gas sector stem from a large number of small sources emitting in aggregate, corroborating findings from several other studies. 
 Reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas (oil–gas) sector has been identified as a critically important global strategy for reducing near-term climate warming. Recent measurements, especially by satellite and aerial remote sensing, underscore the importance of targeting the small number of facilities emitting methane at high rates (i.e., “super-emitters”) for measurement and mitigation. However, the contributions from individual oil–gas facilities emitting at low emission rates that are often undetected are poorly understood, especially in the context of total national- and regional-level estimates. In this work, we compile empirical measurements gathered using methods with low limits of detection to develop facility-level estimates of total methane emissions from the continental United States (CONUS) midstream and upstream oil–gas sector for 2021. We find that of the total 14.6 (12.7–16.8) Tg yr−1 oil–gas methane emissions in the CONUS for the year 2021, 70 % (95 % confidence intervals: 61 %–81 %) originate from facilities emitting <100kgh-1 and 30 % (26 %–34 %) and ∼80 % (68 %–90 %) originate from facilities emitting <10 and <200kgh-1, respectively. While there is variability among the emission distribution curves for different oil–gas production basins, facilities with low emissions are consistently found to account for the majority of total basin emissions (i.e., range of 60 %–86 % of total basin emissions from facilities emitting <100kgh-1). We estimate that production well sites were responsible for 70 % of regional oil–gas methane emissions, from which we find that the well sites that accounted for only 10 % of national oil and gas production in 2021 disproportionately accounted for 67 %–90 % of the total well site emissions. Our results are also in broad agreement with data obtained from several independent aerial remote sensing campaigns (e.g., MethaneAIR, Bridger Gas Mapping LiDAR, AVIRIS-NG (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging System – Next Generation), and Global Airborne Observatory) across five to eight major oil–gas basins. Our findings highlight the importance of accounting for the significant contribution of small emission sources to total oil–gas methane emissions. While reducing emissions from high-emitting facilities is important, it is not sufficient for the overall mitigation of methane emissions from the oil and gas sector which according to this study is dominated by small emission sources across the US. Tracking changes in emissions over time and designing effective mitigation policies should consider the large contribution of small methane sources to total emissions."

In regions where plumes are thick and background aerosol is low, models and satellites compare well. However, the input emission inventory tends to underestimate in many places, and particle property and loss rate assumptions vary enormously among models, causing uncertainties that require systematic in situ measurements to resolve. 
 We assessed the biomass burning (BB) smoke aerosol optical depth (AOD) simulations of 11 global models that participated in the AeroCom phase III BB emission experiment. By comparing multi-model simulations and satellite observations in the vicinity of fires over 13 regions globally, we (1) assess model-simulated BB AOD performance as an indication of smoke source–strength, (2) identify regions where the common emission dataset used by the models might underestimate or overestimate smoke sources, and (3) assess model diversity and identify underlying causes as much as possible. Using satellite-derived AOD snapshots to constrain source strength works best where BB smoke from active sources dominates background non-BB aerosol, such as in boreal forest regions and over South America and southern hemispheric Africa. The comparison is inconclusive where the total AOD is low, as in many agricultural burning areas, and where the background is high, such as parts of India and China. Many inter-model BB AOD differences can be traced to differences in values for the mass ratio of organic aerosol to organic carbon, the BB aerosol mass extinction efficiency, and the aerosol loss rate from each model. The results point to a need for increased numbers of available BB cases for study in some regions and especially to a need for more extensive regional-to-global-scale measurements of aerosol loss rates and of detailed particle microphysical and optical properties; this would both better constrain models and help distinguish BB from other aerosol types in satellite retrievals. More generally, there is the need for additional efforts at constraining aerosol source strength and other model attributes with multi-platform observations."

The long-term stability of the data record is further improved through scaling of the profiles using as a reference the GOME-type Total Ozone Essential Climate Variable (GTO-ECV) data record. 
 We present the GOME-type Ozone Profile Essential Climate Variable (GOP-ECV) data record covering the 26-year period from July 1995 until October 2021. It is derived from a series of five nadir-viewing ultraviolet-visible(-near-infrared) satellite instruments of the GOME-type, including GOME/ERS-2, SCIAMACHY/ENVISAT, OMI/Aura, GOME-2/MetOp-A, and GOME-2/MetOp-B, which are merged into a single coherent long-term time series. It provides monthly mean ozone profiles at a spatial resolution of 5° x 5° latitude by longitude. The profiles are given as partial columns for 19 atmospheric layers ranging from the surface up to 80 km. The underlying profile retrieval algorithm is the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory scheme, which has sensitivity to both tropospheric and stratospheric amounts of ozone. The merged profile record has been developed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in the framework of the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative+ (ESA-CCI+) ozone project (Ozone_CCI+). Profiles from the individual instruments are first harmonized through careful inspection and elimination of inter-sensor deviations and drifts and then merged into a combined record. In a further step, the merged time series is harmonized with the GOME-type Total Ozone Essential Climate Variable (GTO-ECV) data record, which is based on nearly the same satellite sensors. GTO-ECV possesses an excellent long-term stability and with the homogenization an improvement of the robustness and stability of the merged profiles can be achieved. For this purpose, an altitude-dependent scaling is applied that utilizes ozone profile Jacobians obtained from a Machine Learning approach. We found that climatological ozone distributions derived from the final GOP-ECV data record agree with spatial and temporal patterns obtained from other long-term data records."

Here, we measured fluorescent bioaerosols in the Finnish sub-Arctic with high time resolution. A data set that might improve our understanding of biosphere-cloud interactions and the dynamics of bioaerosols in the atmosphere. 
 Fluorescent aerosol particles (FAPs) as a fraction of total aerosol particles (TAPs) were measured online with a Wideband Integrated Bioaerosol Sensor 5/NEO (WIBS, Droplet Measurement Technologies) from mid-September to mid-December during the Pallas Cloud Experiment 2022 (PaCE22) at the Sammaltunturi station, located in the sub-Arctic region of Finnish Lapland. The WIBS measures particle size distributions from 0.5 to 30 µm and fluorescence in three channels of single aerosol particles, as well as particle concentrations. Since most biological aerosol particles exhibit intrinsic fluorescence, FAP concentration can be used as a proxy for primary biological aerosol particles (PBAPs) like bacteria, fungal spores and pollen. The concentrations and size distributions of different fluorescent particles, together with meteorological data and air mass trajectories allow valuable insights to the emission of PBAPs from northern boreal forests and their dynamic in the atmosphere. We found a clear seasonal trend for most FAP types and a strong, sudden decrease in concentration after the surrounding ground is covered in snow. Caution should be taken in interpreting the data, as interference may be introduced by non-biological fluorescent particles like secondary organic aerosols or soot, as well as biological secondary organic aerosol.

We combine 15 years of daily species-specific PM2.5 concentrations from 700 air pollution monitors with satellite-derived ambient wildfire smoke PM2.5, and use a panel regression to estimate wildfire smoke’s contribution to the concentrations of 27 different chemical species in PM2.5. Wildfire smoke drives detectable increases in the concentration of 25 out of the 27 species with the largest increases observed for organic carbon, elemental carbon, and potassium. We find that smoke originating from wildfires that burned structures had higher concentrations of copper, lead, zinc, and nickel relative to smoke from fires that did not burn structures. Wildfire smoke is responsible for an increasing share of ambient concentrations of multiple species, some of which are particularly harmful to health. Using a risk assessment approach, we find that wildfire-induced enhancement of carcinogenic species concentrations could cause increases in population cancer risk, but these increases are very small relative to other environmental risks. We demonstrate how combining ground-monitored and satellite-derived data can be used to measure wildfire smoke’s influence on chemical concentrations and estimate population exposures at large scales."

In this study, the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, coupled with near-real-time emission inventories, was utilized to quantify the contributions of meteorological conditions and anthropogenic emissions to the severe PM2.5 rebound observed in February 2023. The results revealed that anthropogenic emissions and meteorological factors accounted for 59% and 41% of the rebound, respectively. Increased activities in transportation, domestic combustion, and power and industrial sectors significantly elevated NOX, SO2, and primary particulate emissions. Key meteorological drivers included higher relative humidity, reduced wind speed, and a lower atmospheric boundary layer height, which were linked to anomalous southerly wind patterns over the NCP.

An additional model simulation is used to quantify the sensitivity of O3 to long‐term changes in chlorine and bromine and thus determine the chemical contribution of the spatially varying halogen trends to both observed and modeled O3 trends. Overall, the recent dynamically induced variation in mid‐latitude LS halogen abundance has, through chemical feedback, accentuated the O3 recovery signal in the SH and delayed it in the NH, reflecting the enhanced dynamical variability of the NH.

This conclusion is supported by satellite observations, alongside gas measurements and geochemical analyses. 
 The 2017–2018 eruption of Ambae volcano provided a rare opportunity to investigate gas emissions during a sub-Plinian basaltic eruption. Here we document the gas emissions during this eruption using satellite observation, alongside gas measurements and geochemical analyses. Our results indicate that the volcano released 3.3 teragrams of sulfur dioxide, 7.7 of carbon dioxide, 134 of water vapour, 0.2 of hydrogen sulfide, and 0,001 of dihydrogen, ranking Ambae among the world’s top volcanic gas emitters. Despite these substantial emissions, the relatively modest volume of 0.47 cubic kilometer of magma that fueled the eruption indicates a volatile-rich magma source. This enrichment is likely linked to the geodynamic setting, where subduction of the faulted, carbonate-rich D’Entrecasteaux Ridge, coupled with an influx of fertile mantle, fostered the formation of volatile-rich magma. High concentrations of volatiles, can drive substantial gas exsolution, increasing magma buoyancy, resulting in greater magma supply and faster ascent rates. Rapid ascent prevents volatile separation from the melt, resulting in powerful gas surges that drive the transition from effusive to basaltic sub-Plinian eruption phases.

 Since the 2000s, there has been a marked acceleration in the decline of summer Arctic sea ice, accompanied by an increase in Arctic sea ice variability. However, the impact of Arctic sea ice decline on changes in Arctic atmospheric circulation and its implications for mid-latitude summers remain unclear. Here we propose that the emergence of a dipole-like mode of Arctic atmospheric circulation, driven by the Arctic sea ice decline, is linked to the intensification of temperature rise and increased European heat waves. Idealized model experiments support that the recent intensification of the Arctic sea ice decline is a key driver for the emergence of dipole-like atmospheric circulation in mid-latitude summer. The accelerated Arctic sea ice decline weakens the meridional temperature gradient and the zonal wind in Eastern Europe, develops an anti-cyclonic circulation, and contributes to the intensification of European heat waves. The recent acceleration of Arctic sea ice decline is linked to the emergence of a dipole-like Arctic atmospheric circulation, which amplifies temperature rise and increases European heat waves, according to idealized model experiments."

 Agriculture is an important contributor to air pollution and its health impacts, with ramifications for environmental and health inequity. A substantial fraction of these effects can be attributable to dietary changes, but the extent of such impacts remains unclear. Here we show that the PM2.5-related mortality attributable specifically to dietary changes and the associated rising agricultural emissions has a high Gini coefficient of 0.369 in China in 2010, and raises the Gini coefficient of all-cause PM2.5-related mortality from 0.189 to 0.197 with more uneven allocation among income groups, reflecting worsened health inequity and an export of pollution from richer coastal regions to poorer agricultural regions via food trade. Such mortality is associated positively with urbanization but negatively with green space and healthcare quality. Our results also provide empirical evidence for the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis, and offer decision support for equitable clean air, food and health policies in China.

This could play a role in shaping public perception of SAI. Noticeability depends strongly on tropospheric aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the amount of SAI used. We aim to quantify the noticeability of changes in sky color and brightness due to SAI. We use a 3D visible light radiative transfer package to generate cloudless sky images during high sun, sunset, and twilight under SAI from the reference point of a ground observer. We consider three aerosol types: H2SO4, CaCO3, and diamond. We consider stratospheric aerosol loadings required to produce radiative forcings of −1, −2, and −4 W m−2. We use population density and AOD data to compute the distribution of AODs people experience and then simulate sky images for the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of that distribution. We compare the simulated changes in color and brightness to experimental measurements of minimum thresholds humans can detect. The three aerosol types cause similar changes, except most notably the diamond aerosol increases brightness of the solar aureole by roughly three to five times less than do H2SO4 or CaCO3. During high sun, sky whitening from sulfate SAI at −2 W m−2 is undetectable for roughly half of observers chosen randomly from the global population. For the remainder of the population, we expect whitening to still be unnoticeable for all but perhaps the most astute observers aided by color samples. Brightening and enlargement of the solar aureole is the most visible feature during high sun for H2SO4 and CaCO3, while changes near twilight would be the most noticeable impact of SAI. We cannot evaluate the fraction of the population who would notice these changes."

Rare aerosols known as ice-nucleating particles can play an important role in cloud ice formation, but their representation in global climate models is not well suited for the Arctic. In this study, the simulation of cloud phase is improved when the representation of these particles is constrained by Arctic observations. 
 Projections of global climate change and Arctic amplification are sensitive to the representation of low-level cloud phase in climate models. Ice-nucleating particles (INPs) are necessary for primary cloud ice formation at temperatures above approximately −38 °C and thus significantly affect cloud phase and cloud radiative effect (CRE). Due to their complex and insufficiently understood variability, INPs constitute an important modelling challenge, especially in remote regions with few observations, such as the Arctic. In this study, INP observations were carried out at Andenes, Norway, in March 2021. These observations were used as a basis for an Arctic-specific and purely temperature-dependent INP parameterization, which was implemented into the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM). This implementation results in an annual average increase in cloud liquid water path (CLWP) of 70 % for the Arctic and improves the representation of cloud phase compared to satellite observations. The change in CLWP in boreal autumn and winter is found to likely be the dominant contributor to the annual average increase in net surface CRE of 2 W m−2. This large surface flux increase brings the simulation into better agreement with Arctic ground-based measurements. Despite the fact that the model cannot respond fully to the INP parameterization change due to fixed sea surface temperatures, Arctic surface air temperature increases by 0.7 °C in boreal autumn. These findings indicate that INPs could have a significant impact on Arctic climate and that a region-specific INP parameterization can be a useful tool to improve cloud representation in the Arctic region."

The fluorescence measurements were taken at five wavelengths. The results revealed that fluorescence capacity increases with altitude, suggesting a higher concentration of organic compounds in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere than in the lower troposphere. The fluorescence spectra peaked in the 513 and 560 nm channels in smoke layers but decreased with wavelength in urban aerosols. 
 The fluorescence lidar at the Prokhorov General Physics Institute (Moscow) was utilized to study smoke transported over the Atlantic during the wildfire season from May to September 2023. The lidar system, which is based on a tripled Nd : YAG laser, performs fluorescence measurements across five spectral intervals centered at wavelengths of 438, 472, 513, 560 and 614 nm. This configuration enables the assessment of the spectral dependence of fluorescence backscattering over a broad range of altitudes, from the planetary boundary layer (PBL) to the middle and upper troposphere (MUT). The fluorescence capacity of smoke, defined as the ratio of fluorescence backscattering to aerosol backscattering at the laser wavelength, exhibits significant variation in the MUT, with changes of up to a factor of 3. This variation is likely indicative of differences in the relative concentration of organic compounds within the smoke. Analysis of more than 40 smoke episodes has enabled an evaluation of the height dependence of smoke fluorescence properties. Observations reveal that the fluorescence capacity generally increases with altitude, suggesting a higher concentration of organic compounds in the MUT compared to the lower troposphere. Additionally, the measurements consistently show differences in the fluorescence spectra of smoke and urban aerosol. Urban aerosol fluorescence tends to decrease gradually with wavelength, whereas the peak of smoke fluorescence is observed in the 513 and 560 nm channels. This spectral distinction provides an effective means of separating smoke from urban aerosol. The technique was applied the analysis of events where smoke from the upper troposphere descended into the PBL, demonstrating its utility in distinguishing between these aerosol types."

These symptoms are concentration dependent; thus accurate information about the pollen load in the atmosphere is essential. Moreover, pollen grains and fragments of it are likely to contribute to cloud processes and suppress precipitation. Here, we estimate the concentration and cloud-relevant parameters of birch pollen in the atmosphere using observations from a PollyXT and a CL61 ceilometer. 
 The accurate representation of microphysical properties of atmospheric aerosol particles – such as the number, mass, and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration – is key to constraining climate forcing estimations and improving weather and air quality forecasts. Lidars capable of vertically resolving aerosol optical properties have been increasingly utilized to study aerosol–cloud interactions, allowing for estimations of cloud-relevant microphysical properties. Recently, lidars have been employed to identify and monitor pollen particles in the atmosphere, an understudied aerosol particle with health and possibly climate implications. Lidar remote sensing of pollen is an emerging research field, and in this study, we present for the first time retrievals of particle number, mass, CCN, giant CCN (GCCN), and ultragiant CCN (UGCCN) concentration estimations of birch pollen derived from polarization lidar observations and specifically from a PollyXT lidar and a Vaisala CL61 ceilometer at 532 and 910 nm, respectively.A pivotal role in these estimations is played by the conversion factors necessary to convert the optical measurements into microphysical properties. This set of conversion parameters for birch pollen is derived from in situ observations of major birch pollen events at Vehmasmäki station in eastern Finland. The results show that under well-mixed conditions, surface measurements from in situ instrumentation can be correlated with lidar observations at higher altitudes to estimate the conversion factors. Better linear agreement to the in situ observations was found at the longer wavelength of 910 nm, which is attributed to a combination of lower overlap and higher sensitivity to bigger particles compared to observations at 532 nm. Then, the conversion factors are applied to ground-based lidar observations and compared against in situ measurements of aerosol and pollen particles. In turn, this demonstrates the potential of ground-based lidars such as a ceilometer network with the polarization capacity to document large-scale birch pollen outbursts in detail and thus to provide valuable information for climate, cloud, and air quality modeling efforts, elucidating the role of pollen within the atmospheric system."

One question is how aerosols affects the amount of cloud water. We used a cloud-scale model to study these effects on marine clouds. The study showed that variations in cloud properties and instrument noise can cause bias in satellite-derived cloud water content. However, our results suggest that for similar weather conditions with well-defined aerosol concentrations, satellite data can reliably track these effects. 
 The response in cloud water content to changes in cloud condensation nuclei remains one of the major uncertainties in determining how aerosols can perturb cloud properties. In this study, we used an ensemble of large eddy simulations of marine stratocumulus clouds to investigate the correlation between cloud liquid water path (LWP) and the amount of cloud condensation nuclei. We compare this correlation directly from the model to the correlation derived using equations which are used to retrieve liquid water path from satellite observations. Our comparison shows that spatial variability in cloud properties and instrumental noise in satellite retrievals of cloud optical depth and cloud effective radii results in bias in the satellite-derived liquid water path. In-depth investigation of high-resolution model data shows that in large part of a cloud, the assumption of adiabaticity does not hold, which results in a similar bias in the LWP–CDNC (cloud droplet number concentration) relationship as seen in satellite data. In addition, our analysis shows a significant positive bias of between 18 % and 40 % in satellite-derived cloud droplet number concentration. However, for the individual ensemble members, the correlation between the cloud condensation nuclei and the mean of the liquid water path was very similar between the methods. This suggests that if cloud cases are carefully chosen for similar meteorological conditions and it is ensured that cloud condensation nuclei concentrations are well-defined, changes in liquid water can be confidently determined using satellite data."

This study reveals that coarse aerosol particles invigorate shallow rainfall through enhanced coalescence processes, whereas fine aerosol particles suppress shallow rainfall through intensified microphysical breaks. These impacts are independent of thermodynamic environments but are more significant in low-humidity conditions. 
 Densely populated southern China, adjacent to the South China Sea, which is associated with shallow precipitation during summer, is an open-air natural laboratory for studying the impact of aerosol particles on shallow-precipitation events. Using 8 years of data from Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar measurements, aerosol reanalysis, and atmospheric reanalysis, this study investigates the potential influence of coarse and fine aerosol particles on the structure of the precipitation and the microphysical processes of shallow precipitation in southern China. Statistical results indicate that during coarse-aerosol-polluted  conditions, shallow-precipitation clouds have a lower mean height of the storm top (STH; ∼3.2 km) but a higher mean near-surface rain rate (RR; ∼1.78 mm h−1) and are characterized by high concentrations of large raindrops, driven mainly by significant collision–coalescence processes (accounting for 74.1 %). In contrast, during fine-aerosol-polluted conditions, shallow-precipitation clouds develop a deeper median STH of ∼3.7 km with lower surface RR characterized by a low concentration of small raindrops, resulting from increased breakup processes (33.1 %) and reduced collision–coalescence processes (69.6 %). The coarse (fine) aerosol particles act as promoters (inhibitors) of radar reflectivity in the profile of shallow precipitation, regardless of dynamic and humid conditions. The effect of coarse aerosol particles in promoting precipitation and the inhibiting effect of fine aerosol particles are the most significant under low-humidity conditions, mainly attributed to significantly enhanced collision–coalescence processes, exceeding 22.2 %. Furthermore, the increase in RR above 3 km in coarse-aerosol-polluted environments is mainly driven by the high concentration of hydrometeors in low-instability conditions, whereas it is driven by large hydrometeors in high-instability environments."

The FDA accurately reproduced NOx emissions when column observations were limited to the boundary layer and when the variability of the NO2 lifetime, the NOx : NO2 ratio, and NO2 profile shapes were correctly modeled. This introduces strong model dependency, reducing the simplicity of the original FDA formulation. 
 The flux divergence approach (FDA) is a popular technique for deriving NOx emission estimates from tropospheric NO2 columns measured by the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI)  satellite sensor. An attractive aspect of the FDA is that the method simplifies three-dimensional atmospheric chemistry and transport processes into a two-dimensional (longitude–latitude) steady-state continuity equation for columns that balances local NOx emissions with the net outflow and chemical loss of NOx. Here we test the capability of the FDA to reproduce known NOx emissions from synthetic NO2 column retrievals generated with the LOTOS-EUROS chemistry transport model over the Netherlands at high spatial resolution of about 2×2 km during summer. Our results show that the FDA captures the magnitude and spatial distribution of the NOx emissions to high accuracy (absolute bias <9 %), provided that the observations represent the NO2 column in the boundary layer, that wind speed and direction are representative for the boundary layer (PBL) column, and that the high-resolution spatiotemporal variability of the NO2 lifetimes and NOx:NO2 ratio is accounted for in the inversion instead of using single fixed values. The FDA systematically overestimates NOx emissions by 15 %–60 % when using tropospheric NO2 columns as the driving observation, while using PBL NO2 columns largely overcomes this systematic error. This merely reflects the fact that the local balance between emissions and sinks of NOx occurs in the boundary layer, which is decoupled from the NO2 in the free troposphere. Based on the recommendations from this sensitivity test, we then applied the FDA using observations of NO2 columns from TROPOMI, corrected for contributions from free-tropospheric NO2, between 1 June and 31 August 2018. The NOx emissions derived from the default TROPOMI retrievals are biased low over cities and industrialized areas. However, when the coarse 1×1° TM5-MP NO2 profile used in the retrieval is replaced by the high-resolution profile of LOTOS-EUROS, the TROPOMI NOx emissions are enhanced by 22 % and are in better agreement with the inventory for the Netherlands. This emphasizes the importance of using realistic high-resolution a priori NO2 profile shapes in the TROPOMI retrieval. We conclude that accurate quantitative NOx emissions estimates are possible with the FDA, but they require sophisticated, fine-scale corrections for both the NO2 observations driving the method and  the estimates of the NO2 chemical lifetime and NOx:NO2 ratio. This information can be obtained from high-resolution chemistry transport model simulations at the expense of the simplicity and applicability of the FDA."

This paper reviews treatment of wildfire smoke under the Clean Air Act and the Exceptional Events Rule. It presents quantitative evidence on the effect of the rule on fulfillment of air quality standards, and an analysis of the degree to which smoke that currently leads to air quality violations is driven by out-of-state fires and fires on federal lands.

The influence of PM0.1 on neurodevelopmental disorders and its underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood but are of significant concern. Through an investigation using mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), our study has uncovered disruptions in cell cycle dynamics, reduced neural precursor formation, and impaired neurogenesis during mESC neural differentiation as a result of PM0.1-induced neurodevelopmental toxicity. By employing N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing and bioinformatics, we identified Zic1 as a key target of PM0.1-induced developmental disturbances. Our mechanistic findings indicate that PM0.1 enhances m6A methylation of Zic1 by upregulating Mettl3, leading to decreased mRNA stability and expression of this gene. Furthermore, the efficacy of the METTL3 inhibitor in alleviating nerve differentiation impairments emphasizes the significance of this pathway. In addition, source analysis, molecular docking, and toxicity analyses show that PAHs with higher ring structures in PM0.1 from combustion sources competitively bind to METTL3, potentially exacerbating neurodevelopmental toxicity. This study not only underscores the severe impact of PM0.1 on neurodevelopment but also reveals the pivotal role of m6A modification in mediating these effects, providing valuable insights and potential therapeutic targets for mitigating PM0.1-related health risks."

Alkane, carboxylic acid, and hydroxyl groups were the main components of the organic aerosol (OA), contributing 35.0%, 22.5%, and 21.8%, respectively. The mass concentrations and size distributions of the OFGs strongly depended on ambient relative humidity (RH). Specifically, the OFG mass concentrations were 50% higher during the high‐RH periods than the low‐RH periods. The peak size of the OFGs size distribution was 0.56–1 μm during the high‐RH periods, while a peak size of 0.32–0.56 μm was observed during the low‐RH periods. In addition, the concentrations of the total OA, carboxylic acid, and hydroxyl groups were positively correlated with the photochemical age (PCA), with the high‐RH samples increasing faster (greater slope) with PCA and being associated with a higher oxygen‐to‐carbon ratio. These results suggest that aqueous‐phase processing likely enhanced the production of the OFGs, especially oxygenated functional groups. Further analysis of size distribution of the oxygenated OFGs and the viscosity of aerosols indicates that the secondary OFGs were formed via surface‐limited mechanisms under low‐RH conditions and volume‐limited mechanisms under high‐RH conditions.

10.1038/s41612-025-00930-3,True,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science,这篇论文研究了近几十年来欧洲地区变暖速度远高于全球平均水平的原因。文中指出，1979年至2022年期间，欧洲地表气温的升温速度约为全球平均升温速度的三倍。研究人员使用基于观测的简单方法，估计大约40%（冬季）和29%（夏季）的额外变暖归因于大气环流的变化。同时，研究还利用CMIP6气候模式进行模拟，发现这些模式能够较好地模拟观测到的欧洲变暖速率，但这主要是因为这些模式模拟的全球平均变暖速度过快，导致对欧洲额外变暖的低估。研究结果表明，人为气溶胶变化对夏季额外变暖的贡献最大，而温室气体引起的增温对冬季额外变暖的贡献最大。模型还暗示，未来夏季欧洲额外变暖的速度将大大降低。然而，由于现有模型无法模拟观测到的环流趋势，这给未来欧洲变暖速度预测带来了很大的不确定性。 这项研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它依赖于地表气温等观测数据，并利用气候模型来分析大气环流变化对欧洲变暖的影响。,"['Surface Air Temperature', 'Atmospheric Circulation', 'Climate Models (CMIP6)', 'Satellite observations', 'European regional warming', 'Global warming']",Buwen Dong;Rowan T. Sutton,Drivers and mechanisms contributing to excess warming in Europe during recent decades,"Drivers and mechanisms contributing to excess warming in Europe during recent decades 
 Over the period 1979-2022, European surface air temperatures warmed around three times as fast as the global mean temperatures in both winter and summer. Here we define “excess” European warming as the difference between the rate of European regional warming and the rate of global warming and investigate the causes. Using a simple observation-based method, we estimate that around 40% ± 39% (in winter) and 29% ± 10% (in summer) of excess European warming is “dynamical” - attributable to changes in atmospheric circulation. We show that the rate of European warming simulated in CMIP6 models compares well with the observations, but only because these models warm too fast in the global mean; excess European warming is underestimated, particularly in winter. The CMIP6 models simulate well the magnitude of the thermodynamic component of excess European warming since 1979 in both winter and summer, they suggest only a weak dynamical contribution in the multi-model mean. The models suggest greenhouse gas-induced warming made the largest contribution to excess thermodynamic warming in winter, whereas changes in anthropogenic aerosols made the largest contribution in summer. They also imply a substantially reduced future rate of excess European warming in summer. However, the failure of current models to simulate observed circulation trends (either as a forced response or as a combination of forced response and internal variability) also implies large uncertainty in future rates of European warming."

 A mysterious air pollution event occurred in south China on April 1–2, 2024, despite the prevailing southerly airflow that is typically associated with clean air. Here, we identified the source of this event using a multi-scale data system that combines large-scale monitoring and modeling data with advanced measurements of aerosol chemical compositions in Hong Kong. Large-scale satellite measurements and chemical transport modeling detected the transboundary transport of a volcanic plume originating from the Taal volcano in the Philippines. Unusually high levels of sulfate (reaching 75% of fine particulate matter) and phosphorus (up to 93 ng/m³) in Hong Kong supported this finding. These analyses prompted the development of a real-time chemical-wind index to identify the occurrence of air pollution associated with volcanic emissions. Our results highlight the value of integrating multi-scale real-time data capabilities to promptly attribute air pollution events to their sources and protect at-risk populations.

 Gross primary productivity (GPP) is more accurately estimated by total canopy solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIFtotal) compared to raw sensor observed SIF signals (SIFobs). The use of two-leaf strategy, which distinguishes between SIF from sunlit (SIFsunlit) and shaded (SIFshaded) leaves, further improves GPP estimates. However, the two-leaf strategy, along with SIF corrections for bidirectional effects, has not been applied to transpiration (T) estimation. In this study, we used the angular normalization method to correct the bidirectional effects and separate SIFsunlit and SIFshaded. Then we developed SIFsunlit and SIFshaded driven semi-mechanistic and hybrid models, comparing their T estimates with those from a SIFobs driven semi-mechanistic model at both site and global scales. All three types of SIF-driven T models integrate canopy conductance (gc) with the Penman-Monteith model, differing in how gc is derived: from a SIFobs driven semi-mechanistic equation, a SIFsunlit and SIFshaded driven semi-mechanistic equation, and a SIFsunlit and SIFshaded driven machine learning model. When evaluated against partitioned T using the underlying water use efficiency method at 72 eddy covariance sites and two global T remote sensing products, a consistent pattern emerged: SIFsunlit and SIFshaded driven hybrid model > SIFsunlit and SIFshaded driven semi-mechanistic model > SIFobs driven semi-mechanistic model. The SIFsunlit and SIFshaded driven hybrid model demonstrated a notable proficiency under high vapor pressure deficit and low soil water content conditions. The SIFobs driven semi-mechanistic model tends overestimate T at low T values, and this issue is significantly alleviated by the SIFsunlit and SIFshaded driven semi-mechanistic and hybrid models. Our findings demonstrate that correcting the bidirectional effects and using the two-leaf strategy on GPP estimation can improve T estimation and provide a new global T product incorporating vegetation physiological signal."

 Cloud top and base height (CTH and CBH) are essential in understanding the role of clouds on the weather and climate systems and improving radiation and precipitation simulations. However, inferring accurate cloud heights from passive satellite observations remains more challenging, especially for CBH. This study developed an effective and convenient method for estimating cloud heights for different cloud types on a global scale. The method is based on the mean lapse rate from surface to cloud top (Γct), the lapse rate within (Γcb1) and below cloud (Γcb2), which are calculated from collocated active and passive satellite observations. The CTH and CBH can be easily derived based on cloud top temperature (CTT), surface temperature (ST), surface height (SH), Γct, Γcb1 and Γcb2. The lapse rate method was applied to polar-orbiting and geostationary passive satellites and the performances were evaluated using cloud heights measurements from CloudSat and CALIPSO satellite. Overall, our retrieval results can achieve high accuracy and stability in estimating both CTH and CBH. For example, our CTH results have significantly improved the retrieval accuracy, with mean bias error (MBE) is 0 km and R is 0.96, and the absolute bias error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) are reduced from 1.12 km and 1.72 km to 0.85 km and 1.33 km, respectively, compared with the MODIS CTH product. Our CBH retrieval results based on MODIS CTT and ST also agree well with CloudSat and CALIPSO observations, the R is 0.91 and the MAE, MBE and RMSE are 0.73 km, 0 km and 1.26 km, respectively. The cloud geometric thickness derived from the cloud heights retrieval results also agrees well with the active satellite observations (MAE = 0.97 km, MBE = 0 km, RMSE = 1.44 km and R = 0.91). In addition, the good performance of cloud heights retrieval during night and for geostationary satellites can further illustrate the excellent accuracy and strong applicability of the lapse rate method. Specifically, compared with SatCORPS Himawari-8 product, the MAE and RMSE of CTH (CBH) are reduced by 41.5 % (44.2 %) and 39.4 % (36.6 %), respectively. These statistical results confirm that our method has comparable performance to other algorithms (e.g., machine learning and other empirical methods), in the meantime, exhibiting the advantages of simplicity and less input parameters. In addition, the lapse rate method can also be employed to provide a supplemental criterion on determining cloud layers from radiosonde data."

 Influenced by lockdown policies and anomalies in human activities, emergencies such as pandemic significantly altered the urban thermal environment. However, the spatiotemporal heat anomaly changes across and within cities during emergencies and their drivers have not been fully investigated. This study quantified the changes in the urban thermal environment in China before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on z-scores and multiscale geographically weighted regression models, heat anomaly changes and transfer patterns of different land uses in cities with varying degrees of pandemic impact and drivers were estimated. During the entire year, we found that although the pandemic significantly reduced surface urban heat island intensity during 5 % to 35 % of days, it did not change significantly throughout 2020. During the first-level public health emergency response, the land surface temperatures of residential and commercial lands notably affected by the pandemic decreased by −0.195°C and −0.371°C, and the shifting of strong heat anomaly zones in industrial lands increased heat anomaly and no heat anomaly zones by 6.1 % and 1.4 %, respectively.

 Understanding the sources and formation processes of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is crucial for improving urban air quality and public health. This study provides a real-time analysis of PM2.5-bound water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) and related carbonaceous species during winter, spring, and summer periods in 2023–2024, aiming to identify their major sources in central Los Angeles. Using advanced online monitoring equipment, including a Sunset Laboratory EC/OC analyzer and a custom-developed setup including a total organic carbon (TOC) analyzer coupled with a particle collection system, we obtained hourly measurements of organic carbon (OC), its fractions (OC1-OC4, based on volatility), elemental carbon (EC), and WSOC. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) identified three principal PM2.5 sources: vehicular emissions, secondary organic carbon (SOC) formation influenced by nighttime aqueous-phase chemical processes, and SOC formation driven by daytime photochemical reactions. Vehicular emissions dominated EC levels, accounting for 86–95% across seasons. This factor also had high contributions from nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) (75–82%), vehicle counts (approximately 85%), and OC1 (51–83%), reflecting the persistent influence of traffic emissions. Nighttime SOC formation was significant in winter, with WSOC and OC4 contributing 58% and 40% to this factor. In contrast, daytime photochemical SOC formation was prominent in summer, with WSOC and OC4 contributing 63% and 47%, and ozone loading up to 89%, reflecting increased photochemical activity. Spring exhibited a mix of aqueous and photochemical SOC formation, with similar contributions from WSOC (38-35%) and OC4 (35-33%), reflecting the transitional season's mixed SOC formation mechanisms. Diurnal profiles revealed that primary emissions peaked during morning rush hours, while secondary formation processes elevated OC levels at night in winter and during afternoons in summer.

 The aerosol fine mode fraction (FMF), which quantitatively describes the fine mode aerosol optical depth (FAOD) as a proportion of the total AOD, is difficult to obtain through remote sensing retrieval. The Chinese advanced Particulate Observing Scanning Polarimeter (POSP) can achieve multispectral polarimetric observation from ultraviolet (UV) to short-wave infrared (SWIR), making it sensitive to aerosol particle size and expected to enhance the capability of FMF retrieval. In this paper, an FMF retrieval model based on an ensemble neural network (ENN) is proposed, which fully exploits the relationship between multi-spectrally polarimetric data of POSP and FMF parameter, and realizes the high-precision as well as spatiotemporal continuous FMF retrieval. The validation shows that the retrieved FMF is in high agreement with AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) FMF, and the retrieval accuracy increases as AOD increase. By analyzing the importance of the input parameters, it is found that the polarimetric measurement at 865 nm is the most important for FMF retrieval, and the average importance of the polarimetric measurement is the highest. By comparing the global seasonal FMF and FAOD for 2022, as well as cases of forest fires and dust, it can be observed that POSP FMF accurately captures the distribution of fine and coarse aerosol particles, aligning well with real-world conditions. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in FMF retrieval."

 Estimation of the smoke emissions released by wildfires has become a significant concern in the context of atmospheric environment and global climate change, in which satellite-borne optical remote sensing plays an important role. Previous studies have utilized the satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) algorithm to estimate the wildfire-related total particulate matter emissions (TPM). However, this “top-down” approach is often impeded by false or missed detection due to extensive cloud cover and smokes with high concentrations, resulting in an underestimation of TPM. To address these limitations, this study proposes a new ultraviolet (UV)-based methodology for the identification and quantification of wildfire smokes from satellite platforms. The spectral characteristics of smoke plumes and different cloud types, including cirrus and cumulus clouds, are characterized by China's Haiyang-1C/D (HY-1C/D) satellites within both UV and visible wavelengths. Specifically, the 355 nm UV band displays a strong absorption pattern associated with smoke plumes. Based on this diagnostic spectral feature, an ultraviolet smoke index (UVSI) is developed, which can mitigate the impact of high background heterogeneity. Moreover, in comparison with the MODIS AOD algorithm, the UVSI index can not only improve the precision of smoke detection, especially for smokes with high concentrations, but also demonstrate a strong correlation with AOD at the numerical level. Accordingly, this study proposes the use of UVSI in place of AOD for TPM estimation. Combined with the fire radiative energy (FRE) measured by GOES-R satellite, the smoke emission coefficient (Ce) can be determined, which is 34.37 g MJ−1 for the September 2020 burning season in North America. The above results would provide a new reference for operational monitoring and assessment of wildfire smokes."

 The study investigated the bioaerosol load and associated possible health risks at diverse macro-environments in the middle Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) region. The seasonal bioaerosol load investigations showed summer and monsoon seasons having higher concentrations than winter and post-monsoon seasons in outdoor environments. Besides meteorological factors (temperature and RH), the cytotoxic effect of PM2.5 was seen on ambient bioaerosol concentrations (R = −0.97, p < 0.05). This adverse effect of PM2.5 on bioaerosols was also validated in lab studies on model organism Escherichia coli. The results demonstrated bacteriostatic effects in used range of concentrations. Although lethal concentration (LC50) was not reached even at PM2.5 treatment of 80 μg/ml, a concentration-dependent inhibition of bacterial cell viability was observed.Furthermore, the health risk associated with bioaerosol exposure in the region was very high. The calculated hazard ratio was greater than one at all IGP locations, with very high potential of infection in polluted city center compared to pristine city outskirts. Higher hospital visits related to pulmonary infections by the people was reported in the city center compared to the city outskirts. The Gram-negative bacteria was found to be more closely associated with respiratory problems in the exposed population. The detailed investigations found pathogenic bacteria, particularly those associated with the genera Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, and Enterobacteriaceae, to be prominent in the ambient air.

 The effects of temperature on the yield and composition of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formed from the oxidation of n-dodecane by Cl atoms under high-NO conditions were investigated. The SOA yields at 298 K, 288 K, and 278 K were 71.11%, 81.21%, and 98.73%, respectively, indicating that a decrease in temperature leads to an increase in SOA yield. The compositions of SOA were studied at 298 K and 278 K. At both temperatures, nitrogen-containing products were the main components. However, lower temperatures lead to the formation of more nitrogen-containing products, suggesting that lower temperatures accelerate multi-generational reactions. These results are crucial for assessing the formation and evolution of SOA in the atmosphere, especially under low temperature conditions, such as during the winter season.

The experiments were performed in a 480L glass multipass reactor with in situ FT-IR detection. The main products identified and quantified includes (in molar yield %): succinic anhydride (68 ± 2), propanoic acid (25 ± 1), acetaldehyde (59 ± 1), formaldehyde (10 ± 1) and acetic anhydride (26 ± 2) in the Cl atoms with γ-caprolactone reaction. Meanwhile, butanoic acid (26 ± 1), succinic anhydride (70 ± 2), propanaldehyde (63 ± 1) and propanoic acid (11 ± 1) were identified and quantified for Cl atoms with γ-heptalactone reaction. In addition, a chemical mechanism has been proposed taking into account the identified and quantified products. The mechanistic provided by the identified products, reveals that the degradation mechanisms can proceed either through ring opening or oxidation pathways. In these sense, the opening path leads to the carboxylic acids formation and the oxidation forms succinic anhydride. The succinic anhydride quantification, as the major product in both reactions, suggests that the oxidation ring is the most relevant channel in the reactions studied. Considering that the identified acids and anhydrides are of atmospheric importance, due to their potential for acidification of the troposphere and the atmospheric implications have been discussed."

 We construct a continuous 24-h daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5) record with 2 × 2 km2 resolution over eastern China, South Korea, and Japan for 2011–2022 by applying a random forest (RF) algorithm to aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) I and II satellite instruments. This record uniquely covers a 12-year period of rapid change in air quality in East Asia. The RF uses PM2.5 observations from the national surface networks as training data. PM2.5 network data starting in 2015 in South Korea are extended to pre-2015 with a RF trained on other air quality data available from the network including PM10. PM2.5 network data starting in 2014 in China are supplemented by pre-2014 data from the US embassy and consulates. Missing AODs in the GOCI data are gap-filled by a separate RF fit. We show that the resulting GOCI PM2.5 dataset is successful in reproducing the surface network observations including extreme events, and that the network data in the different countries are representative of population-weighted exposure. We find that PM2.5 peaked in 2014 (China) and 2013 (South Korea, Japan), and has been decreasing steadily since those respective years with no region left behind. We quantify the population in each country exposed to annual PM2.5 in excess of national ambient air quality standards and how this exposure evolves with time. The long record for the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) shows a steady decrease from 2013 to 2022 that was not present in the first five years of AirKorea network PM2.5 measurements. Mapping of an extreme pollution event in Seoul with GOCI PM2.5 shows a predicted distribution indistinguishable from the dense urban network observations, while our previous 6 × 6 km2 product smoothed local features. Our product should be useful for public health studies where long-term spatial continuity of PM2.5 information is essential."

 The Ambient Ion Monitor-Ion Chromatography (AIM-IC) system has been widely used for simultaneously monitoring gases and particles in the continental atmosphere. However, its application in marine atmospheres still faces significant challenges. These challenges include dew evaporation on ship surfaces, wave-breaking effects, and emissions from on-ship activities such as seafood cooking, etc., which may result in the AIM-IC reporting artificially high concentrations of basic gases. Here, we report an unexpected but repeated high field blank in the measurement of sticky basic gases - NH3 and alkylamines - during cruises over the Northwest Pacific from 2021 to 2023. The high field blank was identified to be derived from the sampling tube and/or the AIM-IC system, rather than from leakage at sampling tube junctions. It was possibly introduced by emissions of ship combustion, loading activities in the container, and human activities within the cabin, etc., during the cruise campaigns. This issue is expected to occur widely in ship-based marine measurements of sticky basic gases, to varying extents, and restricts the use of the related data. To address this, we developed an approach to exhaustedly subtract the field blank, and the corrected concentrations of the species represent the lower limit of the real signal values.

 The application of diverse methods/tools (satellite data, ground-based monitoring and dispersion modelling) for quantitative assessment of air pollution has created a critical challenge for policymakers, in understating the actual stubble burning contribution in North Indian states including Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and western Uttar Pradesh. Considering the variations in monitoring sites, quantified emissions, satellite data resolutions, parameterization schemes, meteorology and/or adopted models, huge differences in the source contribution are reported. Considering these ambiguities, the present study is an attempt to review the studies revealing actual paddy stubble burning contribution to air quality of Delhi conducted year 2015 onwards; one year before the severe episodic smog event of November 2016. A total of 114 articles were searched using different keywords for subsequent in-depth analysis. The biomass burning share was broadly studied for winter, summer and post-monsoon seasons. Further, to understand the season-specific nature of the paddy stubble burning activity, the analysis was restricted to post-monsoon months. A co-occurrence keyword network analysis was performed based on which biomass/stubble burning related studies were divided into three clusters based on i) source apportionment using receptor modeling, ii) satellite data (AOD values coupled with ground-based observation and wind back trajectory and, iii) regional scale chemical transport modeling approach. Some studies were generalized displaying correlation patterns, some used only fire count data and correlated with AOD while some used either satellite data or regional scale models.

The increased PM concentrations in urban regions have degraded air quality with adverse health impacts. The low-cost sensor (LCS) has the advantage of being deployable in dense numbers for real-time PM measurements. The fine PM (PM2.5) concentrations were recorded at various sites across Jaipur city using LCS from March-2022 to February-2023. The LCS detects PM2.5 concentrations in outdoor ambient at high temporal resolution of 1-min (averaged hourly). The accuracy of LCS data was evaluated seasonally and coefficients of determination (R2) were found to have good agreement with 1:1 slope. The measured PM2.5 concentrations are dominantly influenced by site-specific activities like commercial, industrial, residential and traffic. The heterogeneity of PM2.5 concentrations between sites portrays high spatial divergence (coefficient of divergence >0.2). Pearson's correlation test was conducted to examine the association between PM2.5 concentration and wind speed. Higher wind showed negative correlation with average PM2.5 concentration due to dispersion of the particles.

This study assessed the radiative forcing and vertical heating rate of dust aerosols at Shaartuz, Tajikistan, during the summer of 2023, utilizing data from the sun sky lunar photometer, lidar, and a radiative transfer model. The results indicated that the daily average shortwave radiative forcings of dust aerosols were −32.0 W m−2 at the surface and 30.5 W m−2 in the atmosphere during heavy dust conditions, which were roughly three times greater than those observed with light dust.

The net radiative forcing efficiencies (NRFE) were −30.2, 42.5, and 12.3 W m−2 AOD−1 at the surface, in the atmosphere, and at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), respectively. The maximum shortwave heating rates (SHR) of dust aerosols below 500 m were 0.7, 1.1, and 2.1 K day−1 for light, moderate, and heavy dust conditions, respectively. Under conditions of heavy dust presence, the SHR attained 1.7 K day−1 at an altitude of 3 km, resulting in alterations to the initial thermal configuration of the atmosphere and surface temperature. The maximum surface temperature recorded in heavy dust conditions was 8.6 °C (5.9 °C) lower than the temperatures observed in light dust (moderate dust) conditions. The results contribute to a deeper comprehension of how dust aerosols influence the radiation budget within the Earth's atmospheric system in Central Asia."
10.1016/j.atmosenv.2025.121072,True,Atmospheric Environment,这篇论文研究了长江三角洲地区PM2.5和O3污染的垂直分布、时间演变以及不同污染类型的比较。它利用2018年5月26日至6月16日在南京进行的PBL垂直探空数据，分析了三种污染类型（O3污染、PM2.5污染和PM2.5-O3复合污染）下污染物的垂直结构。研究发现，O3浓度在边界层内随高度增加，而PM2.5和BC浓度随高度降低。在边界层顶部存在PM2.5的跨层传输现象。O3浓度在900米到1500米之间急剧下降，这受边界层高度的影响。不同污染类型下污染物的垂直结构存在差异，并且O3和PM2.5的日变化规律也不同。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它关注大气成分（PM2.5和O3）的垂直分布和时间演变，这可以通过地面观测和卫星遥感技术来获取和分析。,"['PM2.5', 'O3', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Vertical distribution', 'Boundary layer', 'Atmospheric composition', 'Pollution types']",Yulin Wang;Honglei Wang;Shuangshuang Shi;Lijuan Shen;Bin Zhu;Tianliang Zhao,"Observational study of the regional PM<sub>2.5</sub>–O<sub>3</sub> pollution in the Yangtze River Delta region: Vertical distribution, temporal evolution and comparison of different pollution types","•O3increases with height in the boundary layer, while PM2.5and BC decrease. •Cross-layer transport of PM2.5exists at the top of the boundary layer. •Influenced by the boundary layer top, O₃ concentration drops sharply from 900 to 1500 m. •O₃ peaks at 11:00 in increasing stage; PM2.5varies most from 2:00–8:00. 
 The planetary boundary layer (PBL) structure significantly impacts the vertical distribution of atmospheric pollutants. As PM2.5 and O3 are the most important atmospheric pollutants in the Yangtze River Delta, clarifying the vertical structure evolution characteristics within the PBL is crucial for understanding the atmospheric pollution formation mechanism. Via PBL vertical soundings in Nanjing from May 26 to June 16, 2018, the vertical pollutant structure under three pollution types (O3 pollution, PM2.5 pollution, and PM2.5–O3 composite pollution) is examined. The vertical structures of the different pollutants under the three pollution types vary. The O3 concentration increases with height below 900 m under the three pollution types, following composite type > O3 type > PM2.5 type. The O3 concentration suddenly decreases from 900 to 1500 m under the influence of the boundary layer top. The PM2.5 concentration under the three pollution types decreases with height, with the highest concentration below 850 m, but the difference decreases with height. The PM2.5 concentration above 200 m under the O3 pollution type is greater than the composite pollution type. The vertical BC concentration changes under the three pollution types are similar to those in PM2.5, both decreasing with height. The BC concentration differences among the pollution types are greater below 450 m, approximately 1937 ng/m³, while above 450 m, the differences are relatively small, around 576 ng/m³, accounting for about 30 % of the difference below 450 m. The diurnal vertical O3 and BC profile changes are similar across the different pollution types. Overall, the O3 concentration increases by 1.9 times with height, while the BC concentration decreases by 0.48 times. In the PM2.5 pollution type, PM2.5 shows significant cross-layer transport at the boundary layer top following the boundary layer's diurnal variation. The vertical pollutant structure differences at different O3 pollution stages are small, mainly in terms of concentration, with the order being stable stage > reduction stage > increasing stage. At 11:00, the O3 concentration at the increasing stage is much greater than in the other two stages. The PM2.5 concentration difference is large in different stages, especially from 14:00 to 20:00, with small BC differences."

Chan,Development of an aerosol optical depth retrieval algorithm based on an improved scattering angle scheme for Advanced Himawari Imager observations,"•An AOD retrieval algorithm based on scattering angle scheme is developed. •The proposed algorithm outperforms AHI official products. •The algorithm provides diurnal AOD variation with a high spatial resolution. •The algorithm provides more successful retrievals than AHI and MODIS products. 
 The Advanced Himawari Imager carried by the Himawari-8/9 geostationary satellite provides an effective tool for high-temporal-resolution aerosol monitoring with 10-min temporal resolution. Aerosol optical depth (AOD), as a crucial parameter for characterizing aerosols, is typically retrieved using physical-based algorithms that rely on prior assumptions about surface reflectance and aerosol models. However, these assumptions may not satisfy the complex land and atmospheric circumstances. This study develops a new AOD retrieval algorithm that improves the accuracy of surface reflectance and aerosol model by leveraging the time-series geostationary observations and aerosol properties clustered from precise ground-based measurements. AOD retrievals for 2022 to 2023 were conducted for southern China (mainly in Guangdong province), and validated against ground measurements from AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) and Sun-sky radiometer Observation NETwork (SONET). The results are also compared with aerosol products from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The retrieval results showed high consistency with AERONET/SONET, achieving a correlation coefficient of 0.74, RMSE of 0.18, and over 52 % of retrievals within the expected error envelopes (EE) of ±(0.05 + 15 %). In comparison, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) AOD products have a lower correlation coefficient of 0.232, RMSE of 0.330, and only about 30 % of retrievals within the EE of ±(0.05 + 15 %). Furthermore, the proposed algorithm outperforms MODIS in terms of accuracy over their common retrievals. The algorithm based on a newly developed scattering scheme improves the retrieval accuracy at different times and can show aerosol diurnal variations in south China."

 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their derivatives (oxy-PAHs and nitro-PAHs) are released during the biomass combustion process, both in the exhaust gas and bound to the particulate matter (PM). The composition of PAHs, including the number of carbon atoms and their molecular weight, is directly related to their toxicity. The aim of this work was to determine the PM-bound emission of the 16 EPA priority PAHs and some of their nitrated and oxygenated derivatives from the combustion of exhausted olive cake (EOC) and almond shell (AS) in a domestic boiler at two loads, nominal (55 kW) and partial (24 kW). In addition, pine pellet (P) was investigated as a reference fuel. Total PAHs emissions ranged from 1.7 to 8.4 μg/kg and from 5.7 to 357.8 μg/kg at nominal and partial load, respectively. While AS was the most PAHs-forming fuel at nominal load, EOC caused the highest emission at low load. The influence of the boiler load was quite relevant regarding the molecular weight of PAHs bound to PM. At nominal load, EOC and AS were dominated by low molecular weight compounds (LMW) and high molecular weight compounds (HHW), respectively, while at partial load medium molecular weight (MMW) PAHs gained importance for AS (59 %) and EOC PM were clearly dominated by high molecular weight PAHs (99 %). The higher unburned matter at partial load led to higher oxy and nitro-PAHs concentrations for the three biomass fuels, being in all cases 3 to 4 orders of magnitude lower than their derivative PAHs. EOC at partial load presented the highest value of KEsum and therefore its use in a modular boiler is less recommended from the health risk point of view."

 The Tibetan Plateau (TP) plays a crucial role in regional and global climate dynamics, making accurate precipitation data essential for meteorological studies. However, owing to the complex terrain and sparse observations, precipitation data are inadequate, particularly at the hourly scale, which hinders precise climate modeling and forecasting. To address this, we evaluate three precipitation products—IMERG, CMORPH, and TPHiPr—against observations from 84 rain gauges during summer from 2007 to 2018. Using traditional evaluation metrics and event-based error decomposition, we quantify each error component's contribution to the total bias. Our results show that at the hourly scale, IMERG outperforms CMORPH and TPHiPr, exhibiting the highest correlation with rain gauge data (CC = 0.43) and strong detection ability (POD = 0.58), although TPHiPr performs better at the daily scale. IMERG and CMORPH capture the diurnal cycle of precipitation frequency, but all three products significantly overestimate the precipitation frequency at noon. Additionally, all datasets tend to overestimate light rain and underestimate heavy rain, although IMERG and CMORPH demonstrate stronger detection of heavy rain (>2.6 mm/h) than light rain (0.1–0.2 mm/h). Notably, IMERG tends to detect precipitation events that start and end earlier than observed, with errors in the 0.1–0.2 mm/h intensity range contributing 31.8 % to the total bias. While IMERG performs better than CMORPH and TPHiPr at the hourly scale over the TP, challenges remain in detecting weak precipitation. By highlighting the limitations and strengths of these products, our study provides valuable insights to improve satellite-based precipitation estimates and support better climate modeling and forecasting in this vital region."

 Drought is a common and severe natural hazard worldwide. Understanding its triggering mechanisms is pivotal for comprehending its propagation. However, the triggering mechanisms of multitype drought propagation in diverse climate regions remain unclear. This study presents the first exploration of the triggering mechanisms of multitype drought propagation in the different climate regions of China. ECMWF reanalysis 5th generation and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data were utilized. Drought indices were applied to describe meteorological drought, hydrological drought, agricultural drought, and vegetation drought. The copula function and run theory were employed to estimate the propagation thresholds of multitype drought. The results revealed that (1) the Frank, Gumbel, and Student-t copula functions were optimal for combining different drought types. The generalized Pareto (GP) distribution, Weibull distribution (WBL), and logarithmic normal distribution (Log) were best for describing different types of drought characteristics. (2) The propagation thresholds for meteorological to hydrological and agricultural drought were lower than those for agricultural to hydrological drought. The propagation thresholds for agricultural to hydrological drought were notably greater in the temperate humid and subhumid region in Northeast China (SR-3) and the warm-temperate humid and subhumid region in North China (SR-4). (3) Vegetation drought was more difficult to trigger in forests and deserts than in grasslands and croplands. Vegetation drought was more difficult to trigger in the temperate and warm-temperate desert of northwestern China (SR-1) and the tropical humid region in South China (SR-7). These findings offer profound insights into drought propagation dynamics across various climates and into early warning, defense against, and forecasting of multitype drought."

 This work examines a persistent dust event over the Middle East (29 June - 5 July 2011), the vertical dust cross-sections and associated radiative effects, via the synergy of satellite observations, reanalyses and two regional high-resolution models (WRF-Chem and RegCM4). The model's evaluation showed a generally better performance of WRF-Chem in aerosol optical depth (AOD) simulations, but with notable biases against satellite and reanalysis data. The dust storm started from the Tigris-Euphrates plains, passed over Kuwait, and affected the Persian Gulf and east Saudi Arabia. The dust plumes were further escalated with dust emissions from the Rub-Al-Khali and Oman Deserts, while they mixed over the Arabian Sea with dusty air masses coming from southwest Asia. Shamal wind over the alluvial Iraqi plains and the Persian Gulf, combined with strong monsoon southwesterlies over the Arabian Sea and northern Levar wind over SW Asia facilitated dust emissions from various sources. In addition, dust outflow from East Africa to Arabia caused a surface shortwave (SW) radiation reduction of ∼100–110 W m− 2 in the southern Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and Oman shorelines. Over the northern Arabian Sea, south Red Sea and Gulf of Aden the net (SW + LW) surface radiative effect ranged from −60 to −80 W m−2. A thick dust plume caused higher SW radiative effects over the southern Caspian Sea (−170 W m−2), with a net forcing of −140 W m−2. The dust radiative cooling resulted in reduction in surface temperature (−1 °C to −2 °C) over the major dust-affected areas. Longwave (LW) radiative forcing (up to 50 W m−2) was simulated over the desert regions due to coarse dust. This study highlights notable differences in dust source functions, emission rates, and dust loading between the reanalysis, satellite datasets and model simulations, which may result in important biases in dust radiative effects."

 On 15 April 2016, a destructive tornado impacted the town of Dolores, in the Department of Soriano, southwestern Uruguay (SWUY), resulting in one of the most damaging, single-event weather disasters in Uruguay's history. Remarkably, another strong tornado hit Dolores less than four years earlier on 6 December 2012, causing damage in the south portion of the town. This study investigates the Dolores tornado cases in order to document and compare them, with emphasis on the synoptic- and mesoscale environments that led to the two events. It is shown that both tornadoes occurred far downstream of upper-level troughs, under strong mid- and high-level northwesterly winds, and in warm sectors north of warm fronts in southern Uruguay. Key to the development of the tornadic storms was the presence of northwesterly low-level jets that were instrumental in building up conditional instability and low-level shear for tornadic supercells. Based on the the presence of enhanced lines of cumulus clouds noted on visible satellite imagery, it is speculated that local breeze circulations at the northern edge of the Parana river delta or outflow boundaries may have played a role in fostering storm initiation near the Argentina-Uruguay border, although the available data is insufficient to allow for in-depth analyses of these features. Reanalysis-derived soundings reveal that, upon formation, the storms developed in environments characterized by robust conditional instability, deep-layer shear, low-level helicity, low lifting condensation levels, and weak-to-modest convective inhibition, all ingredients favorable for supercell tornado development. This study stresses the need for more research addressing tornadoes in Uruguay and proposes some avenues for future research."

 The occurrence of severe pollution events is not merely ascribed to internal emission sources but is also influenced by atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). This study examined how variations in ABL affect the pollution formation, accumulation, and dispersion in the mountainous Mongolian Plateau under three distinct atmospheric conditions. Quantitative analyses were performed on particulate matter (PM) and micro-scale meteorological parameters within the ABL. The findings suggest that the convergence of local southwest and southeast winds with northerly winds from the northern mountainous area, in combination with clockwise wind shear within the ABL, can result in explosive PM growth. The persistent transport of southerly airflow near the surface is primarily accountable for the long-term and stable increase in pollutants. Furthermore, low near-surface wind speed (WS), low atmospheric boundary layer height (BLH), high relative humidity (RH), and temperature inversion (TI) are crucial factors contributing to the explosive growth of pollution. Strong northwesterly winds and turbulence directly facilitate pollution dissipation. Turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and friction velocity (u⁎) both exhibit a nonlinear negative correlation with near-surface PM concentration. At an altitude of 50 m, TKE and u⁎ have the most significant impact on PM concentration, with R (Pearson correlation coefficient) of −0.81 and − 0.79 (−0.50 and − 0.17), respectively. Controlling PM2.5 concentration below 75 μg/m3 can rapidly increase TKE and u⁎, with values exceeding 2.1 m2/s2 and 0.8 m/s, thereby significantly enhancing the atmosphere's self-cleaning capacity. When TKE or u⁎ rises above 3.8 m2/s2 or 1.4 m/s, the PM2.5 concentration generally decreases to below 30 μg/m3. TKE and u⁎ above an altitude of 500 m have negligible effects on surface PM."

 Secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA) and secondary organic aerosols (SOA) are major components of atmospheric particulate matter, however, their exact formation pathways are variable during haze evolution and need to be further clarified. To fully elucidate the characteristics of sulfate, nitrate and secondary organic carbon (SOC) and compare their roles in haze formation, PM2.5 samples were collected in downtown Beijing in four seasons, and PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 samples were collected over the severe haze episodes in winter and spring of 2017. The sulfur oxidation ratio (SOR), nitrogen oxidation ratio (NOR), and SOC/OC ratio were used to indicate the formation intensity of the respective secondary species. Based on the correlation analysis between secondary transformation ratios and their influencing factors, we found that relative humidity (RH) played a dominating role in NO3− formation and partitioning in the aerosol phase throughout the year, while SOR and SOC/OC were highly dependent on both O3 and RH. Different from the monotonic increase of SOR and NOR with RH, the SOC/OC ratio first increased and then decreased with increasing RH. The severe haze episode in winter was characterized by simultaneously enhanced secondary production of SO42−, NO3− and SOC. Whereas, the haze event in spring was featured by dramatically enhanced NO3− concentration, signifying the uniquely high contribution of nitrate to haze formation in spring."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.107940,True,Atmospheric Research,这篇论文研究了南极半岛地区太阳辐射和云量变化的时空差异。研究使用了地面观测数据，通过分析位于南极半岛东北部和西部的两个气象站(JGM和KSJ站)2011-2016年的数据，比较了两个地区太阳辐射强度和云量特征的差异。结果表明，南极半岛东部地区太阳辐射强度显著高于西部地区，而云量则西部地区高于东部地区。论文深入分析了太阳天顶角、云量、水汽、反照率等因素对太阳辐射变化的影响，揭示了南极半岛东西部气候条件的显著差异及其对当地大气和冰冻圈过程的影响。虽然研究没有直接使用遥感技术，但其研究结果与卫星遥感观测到的南极地区气候变化信息密切相关，可为改进气候模型和提高气候预测精度提供数据支持。,"['solar radiation', 'cloud cover', 'surface energy budget', 'Antarctic climate', 'pyranometer', 'satellite observations']",Simona Szymszová;Kamil Láska;Seong-Joong Kim;Sang-Jong Park,Variability of solar radiation and cloud cover in the Antarctic Peninsula region,"•Solar radiation was about 28 % higher on the northeastern Antarctic Peninsula. •Higher amount of cloud cover frequently occurred on the western Antarctic Peninsula. •Variation of the solar radiation was affected the most by the solar zenith angle. •Cloud cover and water vapour contributed to solar radiation changes significantly. •Maximal solar radiation was linked to a high-pressure ridge during northwest flow. 
 Solar radiation is a key driver of many physical, chemical and biological processes in Antarctic ecosystems and the main component of the surface energy budget. The downward shortwave radiation (DSR) flux varies greatly in the Antarctic Peninsula region due to cloud cover changes, resulting from climate differences between eastern and western coasts. The DSR intensity was measured using A-class pyranometers at the J.G. Mendel (JGM) station located on the northeastern part of the Antarctic Peninsula and at the King Sejong (KSJ) station located on the western part for the period 2011–2016. The influence of the cloud cover on the DSR flux was evaluated using the cloud modification factor calculated for both stations. The effect of surface pressure, water vapour, albedo, cloud cover, ozone and solar zenith angle was examined using partial correlation. We found a 29 %-higher DSR intensity at the JGM station, while the cloud cover was higher at the KSJ station, with a 28 %-lower cloud modification factor compared with the JGM station. At both stations, the DSR variability was affected mainly by the solar zenith angle, followed by cloud cover at the JGM station, whereas the influence of cloud cover and water vapour was similar at the KSJ station. The effect of the albedo was significant for most of the year at the JGM station but only in the winter at the KSJ station. These results reveal significant differences in climate conditions between the western and eastern coasts, which are reflected in local atmospheric and cryospheric processes."

 This study provides the first evaluation of the detection capabilities of the FY-3G dual-frequency Precipitation Measurement Radar (PMR) using storm top observations. Additionally, the impact of the GPM-CO orbit boost in November 2023 on Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) observations is assessed from the perspective of the PMR. The minimum detectable radar reflectivities for the FY-3G Ku- and Ka-band radars were determined to be 12.03 dBZ and 8.60 dBZ, respectively. Notably, the better sensitivity of the FY-3G Ka-band radar enabled the detection of more and higher storm tops and significantly reduced the misidentification of the melting layer as the storm top compared to the GPM Ka-band Precipitation Radar (KaPR). At the same time, the PMR is more significantly affected by ground clutter, partly as a trade-off for its enhanced sensitivity, compared to the DPR. This increased susceptibility necessitates more rigorous ground validation of its near-surface precipitation retrieval. The sensitivity degradation of the KaPR resulting from the GPM-CO orbit boost further intensifies the underestimation of snow dual-frequency ratio (DFR) measurements, resulting in an increased classification of precipitation as convective by the DFRm method. Our results are expected to illuminate future algorithm development and data comparisons of FY-3G and GPM-CO radars."

Here, we use the coupled high-top Community Earth System Model Version 2 with interactive chemistry to investigate how medium-sized asteroid strikes would affect climate, vegetation, and marine productivity. Our simulations, which inject up to 400 million tons of dust into the stratosphere, show marked disruptions in climate, atmospheric chemistry, and global photosynthesis. Global mean temperatures are projected to drop by 4°C, and global precipitation decreases by 15% in our simulations. The largest relative reductions in global terrestrial and marine net primary productivity reach 36 and 25%, respectively.

Using data-driven approaches, we estimate wetland methane emissions from 2000 to 2100, considering effects of meteorological changes and biogeochemical feedbacks from atmospheric sulfate deposition and CO2fertilization. In low-CO2scenarios (1.5° and 2°C warming pathways), the suppressive effect of sulfate deposition on wetland methane emissions largely diminishes by 2100 due to clean air policies, with resulting emission increases (7 ± 2 Tg a−1) being 35 and 22% of total wetland emission changes. In mid-CO2scenarios (2.4° to 3.6°C warming pathways), sulfate deposition changes modestly, and CO2fertilization contributes >30% of wetland emission increases. Across all scenarios, biogeochemical feedbacks can stimulate 30 to 45% of future wetland emission rises. Under 1.5° and 2°C pathways, wetland methane emissions will likely increase by 20 to 34 Tg a−1by 2100, representing 8 to 15% of the allowable space for anthropogenic methane emissions, a factor not yet considered by current assessments."
10.5194/acp-25-1725-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究的是利用机载测量数据来量化OCO-2卫星观测数据反演得到的区域净CO2通量估计中的误差。研究发现，在化石燃料排放量高的地区，基于观测数据的通量误差估计值显著高于基于模型集合中通量估计值的离散程度计算出的误差估计值。这表明反演估计中存在系统偏差，这可能与所有模型中共同使用的化石燃料排放数据中的误差有关。研究采用了一种方法，该方法首先计算后验CO2浓度集合平均值与机载观测值之间的均方根误差（RMSE），然后通过减去观测误差、表示误差和传输误差来分离出仅由后验净通量集合平均值引起的CO2浓度误差。结果表明，投射到CO2空间的通量误差占区域平均RMSE的55%–85%。在五个区域中，基于观测数据的误差估计值比基于后验通量集合离散程度计算出的误差估计值高出1.33–1.93倍，这意味着实际通量误差被低估了。伴随敏感性分析表明，在化石燃料排放量超过陆地生物圈通量3-31倍的地区，通量误差的低估尤为明显。该研究强调了机载测量数据在量化区域尺度上集合净CO2通量估计误差方面的价值。总而言之，该研究利用卫星数据、机载测量数据和反演模型，定量评估了大气CO2通量估算的精度和误差来源，与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['CO2', 'atmospheric composition', 'satellite observation', 'OCO-2', 'inverse modeling', 'airborne measurement', 'flux estimation', 'error quantification']",Jeongmin Yun;Junjie Liu;Brendan Byrne;Brad Weir;Lesley E.

Biraud,Quantification of regional net CO2 flux errors in the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) v10 model intercomparison project (MIP) ensemble using airborne measurements,"This study quantifies errors in regional net surface–atmosphere CO2 flux estimates from an inverse model ensemble using airborne CO2 measurements. Our results show that flux error estimates based on observations significantly exceed those computed from the ensemble spread of flux estimates in regions with high fossil fuel emissions. This finding suggests the presence of systematic biases in the inversion estimates, associated with errors in the fossil fuel emissions common to all models. 
 Inverse model intercomparison projects (MIPs) provide a chance to assess the uncertainties in inversion estimates arising from various sources. However, accurately quantifying ensemble CO2 flux errors remains challenging and often relies on the ensemble spread. This study proposes a method for quantifying the errors in regional net surface–atmosphere CO2 flux estimates from models taken from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) v10 MIP by using independent airborne CO2 measurements for the period 2015–2017. We first calculate the root mean square error (RMSE) between the ensemble mean of posterior CO2 concentrations and airborne observations and then isolate the CO2 concentration errors caused solely by the ensemble mean of posterior net fluxes by subtracting the observation, representation, and transport errors from seven regions. Our analysis reveals that the flux errors projected onto CO2 space account for 55 %–85 % of the regional average RMSE over the 3 years, ranging from 0.88 to 1.91 ppm. In five regions, the error estimates based on observations exceed those computed from the ensemble spread of posterior fluxes by a factor of 1.33–1.93, implying an underestimation of the actual flux errors, while their magnitudes are comparable in two regions. The adjoint sensitivity analysis identifies that the underestimation of flux errors is prominent where the magnitudes of fossil fuel emissions exceed those of terrestrial-biosphere fluxes by a factor of 3–31 over the 3 years. This suggests the presence of systematic biases in the inversion estimates associated with errors in the prescribed fossil fuel emissions common to all models. Our study emphasizes the value of airborne measurements for quantifying regional errors in ensemble net CO2 flux estimates."

The model accurately captured ozone and carbon monoxide but showed discrepancies for nitrogen dioxide. WRF-Chem was moderately correlated with aerosol optical depth observations and performed well in simulating meteorological parameters, demonstrating its suitability for atmospheric modelling. 
 This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) in simulating meteorological parameters and concentrations of air pollutants across the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for June and December 2022, representing the contrasting summer and winter climatic conditions. The assessment of WRF-Chem performance involves comparisons with ground-based observations for meteorological parameters and satellite retrievals from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) for gaseous pollutants and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for aerosols. The comparison with TROPOMI column concentrations demonstrates that WRF-Chem performs well in simulating the spatio-temporal patterns of total column CO and tropospheric column NO2 and O3, despite certain deficiencies in modelling tropospheric NO2 column concentrations. In particular, WRF-Chem shows a strong correlation with TROPOMI retrievals, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.53 to 0.82 during summer and 0.40 to 0.69 during winter for these gaseous pollutants. The model tends to overestimate NO2 levels, with a higher discrepancy observed in summer (0.50 × 1015 molecules cm−2) compared to winter (0.18 × 1015 molecules cm−2). In comparison with TROPOMI-CO data, the discrepancies are more pronounced in winter, with an underestimation of 0.12 × 1018 molecules cm−2. Additionally, WRF-Chem consistently overestimates ozone levels in both seasons. WRF-Chem also exhibits a moderate correlation with both AERONET and MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements. The correlation at Mezaira is 0.60, while a correlation of 0.65 is observed with MODIS AOD. However, the model tends to overestimate AOD, with a bias of 0.46 at Mezaira and 0.35 compared to MODIS AOD.Meteorological evaluations reveal that the model generally overestimated air temperature at 2 m above ground (T2m) in summer (≤ 0.2 °C) and underestimated it in winter (∼ 3 °C), with correlation coefficients between 0.7 and 0.85. Temperature biases are linked to surface property representation and model physics. For wind speed at 10 m (WS10m), biases were within ± 0.5 m s−1, indicating good agreement, although overestimations suggest deficiencies in surface drag parameterization. The dry bias observed was consistent with other studies due to dry soil, inaccurate mesoscale circulation representation, and bias in forcing data. The model also overestimated incoming shortwave radiation by ∼ 30 W m−2 in December due to reduced cloud cover. Night-time cold and dry biases were observed due to more substantial wind speeds and cooler air advection. Comparisons with ERA5 reanalysis showed regional T2m variations with high correlation coefficients (0.97 in summer, 0.92 in winter). Both WRF-Chem and ERA5 displayed consistent seasonal patterns in the planetary boundary layer, correlating with temperature changes and indicating good overall model performance."

The Mongolian cyclone type led to more frequent and severe dust weather, indicated by PM10 concentrations. To comprehensively forecast the two types of dust weather, a common predictor was established based on 500 hPa anomalous circulation systems, offering insights for dust weather forecasting and climate prediction. 
 Dust weather in North China (NC; 34–42° N, 105–120° E) has worsened in recent years, posing adverse impacts on the environment, human health, and the economy. A super dust storm that occurred on 15 March 2021 raised Beijing's PM10 (particulate matter with a diameter less than 10 µm) concentrations above 7000 µg m−3, while 2023 witnessed the highest spring dust weather frequency in nearly a decade. Previous research has primarily focused on the role of the Mongolian cyclone in influencing dust weather in NC, with less attention given to other synoptic systems. Additionally, the differences in PM10 concentrations in NC caused by different synoptic systems have not yet been quantified. This study demonstrates that the Mongolian cyclone was responsible for 61.7 % of the dust weather in NC, while the remaining 38.3 % was primarily caused by the cold high. The dust intensity induced by the Mongolian cyclone was stronger than that of the cold high, with average maximum PM10 concentrations of 3076 and 2391 µg m−3, respectively. The three-dimensional structure of atmospheric circulation anomalies and related dynamic mechanisms of the two types were concluded. To comprehensively forecast the two types of dust weather, a common predictor was constructed based on the 500 hPa cyclonic anomaly and anticyclonic anomaly circulation systems. These findings contribute to enhancing the comprehension of dust weather in NC and offer insights for both dust weather forecasting and climate prediction."

These forward functions are computationally expensive to evaluate, and as such the key challenge for many satellite missions in their data processing is the time used in these evaluations. Our method is fast and accurate enough, less than 1 % relative error, so that it could be safely used in operational processing. 
 Remote sensing of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) carried out by NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite mission and the related uncertainty quantification effort involve repeated evaluations of a state-of-the-art atmospheric physics model. The retrieval, or solving an inverse problem, requires substantial computational resources. In this work, we propose and implement a statistical emulator to speed up the computations in the OCO-2 physics model. Our approach is based on Gaussian process (GP) regression, leveraging recent research on kernel flows and cross validation to efficiently learn the kernel function in the GP. We demonstrate our method by replicating the behavior of OCO-2 forward model within measurement error precision and further show that in simulated cases, our method reproduces the CO2 retrieval performance of OCO-2 setup with computational time that is orders of magnitude faster. The underlying emulation problem is challenging because it is high-dimensional. It is related to operator learning in the sense that the function to be approximated maps high-dimensional vectors to high-dimensional vectors. Our proposed approach is not only fast but also highly accurate (its relative error is less than 1  %). In contrast with artificial neural network (ANN)-based methods, it is interpretable, and its efficiency is based on learning a kernel in an engineered and expressive family of kernels."

It is based on satellite data on ocean winds, ice movement, and sea surface height. Sensitivity analyses address uncertainties, including variations in sea level products and ice-water drag. The dataset's accuracy is validated against in situ measurements, showing moderate to good agreement on monthly and longer timescales. 
 Ocean-surface stress is a critical driver of polar sea ice dynamics, air-sea interactions, and ocean circulation. This work provides a daily analysis of ocean-surface stress on 25-km Equal-Area Scalable Earth (EASE) Grids across the ice-free and ice-covered regions of the polar oceans (2011–2018 for Arctic, 2013–2018 for Antarctic), covering latitudes north of 60° N in the Arctic and south of 50° S in the Antarctic and Southern Ocean. Ocean-surface stress is calculated using a bulk parameterization approach that combines ocean-surface winds, ice motion vectors, and sea surface height (SSH) data from multiple satellite platforms. The analysis captures significant spatial and temporal variability in ocean-surface wind stress and the resultant wind-driven Ekman transport, while providing enhanced spatiotemporal resolution. Two sensitivity analyses are conducted to address key sources of uncertainty. The first addresses the fine-scale variability in SSH fields, which was mitigated using a 150-km Gaussian filter to smooth three-day SSH datasets and enhance compatibility with the other monthly product, followed by linear interpolation to achieve daily resolution. The second investigates uncertainty in the ice-water drag coefficient, which revealed that variations in the coefficient have a proportional influence on the computed ocean-surface stress under the tested conditions. These uncertainties are most pronounced during winter, with median values reaching 20 % in the Arctic and 40 % in the Southern Ocean. Validation efforts utilized Ice-Tethered Profiler velocity records, revealing moderate correlations (r = 0.6–0.8) at monthly timescales, effectively capturing low-frequency signals but with small northward biases. Satellite-derived velocity fields, including both Ekman and geostrophic components, explain 40–50 % of the total variance. The unexplained variance reflects unresolved processes, such as mesoscale dynamics and other unparameterized factors.

The dataset is considered unique with respect to a range of applications, including compensating for spatiotemporal gaps of sediment-trap measurements, assessments of model simulations, shedding light into physical processes related to the dust cycle, and to better understand dust biogeochemical impacts on oceanic ecosystems, on weather, and climate. 
 Quantification of atmospheric dust deposition into the Atlantic Ocean is provided. The estimates rely on the four-dimensional structure of atmospheric dust provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) – “LIdar climatology of Vertical Aerosol Structure” (LIVAS) climate data record (CDR) established on the basis of Cloud–Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) – Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) routine observations. The data record of atmospheric dust deposition rate is provided for the broader Atlantic Ocean region, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico, confined between latitudes 60° S to 40° N, and is characterized by 5° (zonal) x 2° (meridional) spatial resolution, seasonal-mean temporal resolution, and for the period extending between 12/2006 and 11/2022. The estimates of dust deposition are evaluated on the basis of sediment-trap measurements of deposited lithogenic material implemented as reference dataset with good agreement between the two datasets, revealing the capacity of the satellite-based product to quantitatively provide the amount of dust deposited into the Atlantic Ocean region, as shown by the evaluation intercomparison, evaluation intercomparison characterized by correlation coefficient ~0.79 and mean bias of 5.42 mg/m2d. Moreover, integration of the satellite-based dust deposition rate dataset into AeroVal allows assessment comparison of the variability amongst the dust deposition CDR and dust deposition field estimates provided by the Multiscale Online Nonhydrostatic AtmospheRe CHemistry (MONARCH), EMEP MSC-W, and EC-Earth3-Iron Earth System Models (ESM), with the comparison revealing the capacity of the satellite-based product to follow the seasonal activation of dust source regions and the four-dimensional migration of dust transport pathways. Overall, the annual-mean amount of dust deposition into the Atlantic Ocean is estimated at 274.79 ± 31.64 Tg yr-1, of which 243.98 ± 23.89 Tg yr-1 of dust is deposited into the North Atlantic Ocean and 30.81 ± 10.49 Tg yr-1 of dust is deposited into the South Atlantic Ocean. Moreover, a negative statistically significant trend in Atlantic Ocean dust deposition is also revealed. The satellite-based dust deposition CDR is considered unique with respect to a wide range of potential applications, including compensating for geographical and temporal gaps of sediment-trap measurements, supporting evaluation assessments of model simulations, shedding light into physical processes related to the cycle of dust from emission to transport and eventually deposition, and providing a solid basis to better understand dust biogeochemical impacts on oceanic ecosystems, as well as impacts on weather and climate."

We developed a new method called CRITER, which uses machine learning to fill in the gaps in SST data. Our two-stage approach reconstructs large-scale patterns and refines details. Tested on Mediterranean, Adriatic, and Atlantic seas data, CRITER outperforms current methods, reducing errors by up to 44 %. 
 Satellite observations of sea surface temperature (SST) are essential for accurate weather forecasting and climate modeling. However, this data often suffers from incomplete coverage due to cloud obstruction and limited satellite swath width, which requires development of dense reconstruction algorithms. The current state-of-the-art struggles to accurately recover high-frequency variability, particularly in SST gradients in ocean fronts, eddies, and filaments, which are crucial for downstream processing and predictive tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel two-stage method CRITER (Coarse Reconstruction with ITerative Refinement Network), which consists of two stages. First, it reconstructs low-frequency SST components utilizing a Vision Transformer-based model, leveraging global spatio-temporal correlations in the available observations. Second, a UNet type of network iteratively refines the estimate by recovering high-frequency details. Extensive analysis on datasets from the Mediterranean, Adriatic, and Atlantic seas demonstrates CRITER's superior performance over the current state-of-the-art. Specifically, CRITER achieves up to 44 % lower reconstruction errors of the missing values and over 80 % lower reconstruction errors of the observed values compared to the state-of-the-art."

Despite the critical role of fire–snow interactions in these processes, our understanding of them remains limited. Herein, we conducted small-scale outdoor experiments (20 × 20 × 20 cm3) at subzero temperatures (−5 ± 5 °C) to investigate the impact of natural snowfall and accumulated snow layers (up to 20 cm thick) on shallow smoldering peat fires. We found that even heavy natural snowfalls (a maximum water equivalent snowfall intensity of 1.1 mm/h or a 24 h accumulated snowfall water equivalent precipitation of 7.9 mm) cannot suppress a shallow smoldering peat fire. A thick snow cover on the peat surface can extract heat from the burning front underneath, and the minimum thickness of the snow layer to extinguish the peat fire was found to be 9 ± 1 cm at subzero temperatures, agreeing well with the theoretical analysis. Furthermore, larger-scale field demonstrations (1.5 × 1.5 m2) were conducted to validate the small-scale experimental phenomena.

Living near oil and gas production can lead to deteriorated air quality that negatively impacts human health. This study explores whether three oil- and gas-related exposure metrics: modeled concentrations of 12 gases and particles; oil and gas facility-reported emissions; and active wells are disproportionately distributed in areas with higher concentrations of Indigenous people and community socioeconomic vulnerability. We calculated exposure metrics from 2018 to 2020 in geographic dissemination areas (DAs). We used a rural deprivation index that included income, education, employment, and access to amenities to identify areas of high socioeconomic vulnerability. We estimated that DAs with greater than 90% Indigenous population experience 1.2–1.8 times higher median air pollution concentrations than DAs with less than 10% Indigenous population. We estimated that DAs with high community vulnerability experience higher modeled air pollution and higher odds of exposure to facility emissions, with the most vulnerable areas experiencing 11–96 times higher median air pollution concentrations. Overall, these results suggest the presence of environmental injustice in an area that is expected to continue producing a large portion of Canadian natural gas."

However, the large spatiotemporal variability of emission in complex estuary environments is challenging for large-scale monitoring and budget quantification. This study retrieved water environmental variables associated with N2O cycling based on satellite imagery and developed a machine learning model for N2O concentration estimations. The model was adopted in China’s Pearl River Estuary to assess spatiotemporal N2O dynamics as well as annual total diffusive emissions between 2003 and 2022. Results showed significant variability in spatiotemporal N2O concentrations and emissions. The annual total diffusive emission ranged from 0.76 to 1.09 Gg (0.95 Gg average) over the past two decades. Additionally, results showed significant seasonal variability with the highest contribution during spring (31 ± 3%) and lowest contribution during autumn (21 ± 1%). Meanwhile, emissions peaked at river outlets and decreased in an outward direction. Spatial hotspots contributed 43% of the total emission while covering 20% of the total area. Finally, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was adopted, which showed that temperature and salinity, followed by dissolved inorganic nitrogen, were key input features influencing estuarine N2O estimations.

Despite its importance, the direct relationship between carbon emissions and the atmospheric reactive nitrogen cycle has been poorly understood. This study provides an in-depth investigation of the effects of CO2 on the photochemical transformation of nitrates on mineral dust. The results show that CO2 inhibits the photochemical transformation of nitrate under simulated solar irradiation. Specifically, the NOx production rate from nitrate photolysis with CO2 was significantly reduced to 1.17 × 10–10 mol·s–1, representing a decrease of 57.8%, compared to that without CO2 (2.77 × 10–10 mol·s–1). This inhibition effect can be primarily ascribed to electron competition and the formation of carbonate/bicarbonate intermediates. Quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy unveiled the crucial role of photogenerated electrons in nitrate photolysis, showing its significant competition with photochemical CO2 conversion. Additionally, carbonate/bicarbonate intermediates formed during photochemical CO2 conversion enhance the nitrate stability on mineral dust surfaces, thus, reducing their decomposition rate. This study unveils an overlooked atmospheric process of greenhouse gas participating in the reactive nitrogen cycle, highlighting the unignorable synergistic effects of carbon emissions and air pollution in photochemical reactions."

Recent high‐resolution (HR) WACCM‐X simulations show significant increase in NO in the polar night, and our analysis reveals distinct differences in the vertical transport between the HR and coarse resolution (CR) simulations: The residual mean vertical wind in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region displays mesoscale flow channels that are strong and alternate between upward and downward directions in the former, with large net downward transport over the polar region. In the latter it is much weaker and even upward over large latitude ranges.

Despite these observations, debates continue regarding the hotspots where terrestrial water storage changes dramatically and their causes. This study aims to address these controversies. Utilizing four TWSA products, this research analyzes TWSA's changing patterns and identifies hotspots of significant shifts from 1982 to 2019. The study employed the Bayesian Three‐Cornered Hat method to synthesize the best‐quality TWSA from original four TWSA products and the trends consistent method to identify regions with highly consistent trends. Subsequently, the elasticity coefficient method was used to reveal the causes of TWSA's dramatic changes in hotspots. Results show that TWSA has a declining trend over 66.1% global terrestrial areas during 1982–2019, with an average rate of −0.5 mm/y. The study identified six regions where marked changes in TWSA occurred, including Northern China, Southern Canada, Northern India, Central‐Southern Europe, Southwestern Africa, and Northeastern South America. Attribution analysis reveals that the leaf area index is the predominant factor affecting TWSA changes, dominating in 40.3% of global regions. Potential evapotranspiration (PET) follows closely, dominating in 39.8% of global regions. Meanwhile, only 13.1% and 6.8% of global regions are primarily influenced by precipitation and cropland density respectively. The dominant factor varies in different latitudes. Vegetation greening primarily controls TWSA changes in the high‐latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. This study identified hotspots of TWSA changes and investigated the causes of these variations. Those results will offer direction for prioritizing areas in future water resource management."

The measurements reflect emissions from major forests, wildfires, and industry and provide new information to advance understanding of these sources and their changes over time. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play an important role in modulating the atmosphere's oxidizing capacity and affect tropospheric ozone, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, and organic aerosol formation. Space-based observations can provide powerful global information to advance our knowledge of these processes and their changes over time. We present here the development of new retrievals for four key VOCs (methanol, ethene, ethyne, and HCN) based on thermal infrared radiance observations from the satellite-borne Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS). We update the Retrieval of Organics from CrIS Radiances (ROCR) algorithm developed previously for isoprene to explicitly account for the spectral signal dependence on the VOC vertical profile shape, and we apply this updated retrieval (ROCRv2) to derive column abundances for the targeted species across the full Suomi NPP CrIS record (2012–2023). The CrIS data are well correlated with ground-based Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC) retrievals for methanol (r = 0.77–0.84); HCN and ethyne exhibit lower correlations (r = 0.36–0.44 and 0.56–0.65, respectively) with an apparent 40 % CrIS–NDACC disparity for ethyne. The results reveal robust global distributions of the target VOCs from known biogenic, biomass burning, and industrial source regions, and they demonstrate the impact of anomalous events such as the 2015–2016 El Niño. They also highlight the importance of accurate vertical profile constraints when evaluating and interpreting thermal infrared data records. Initial comparisons of the CrIS observations to predicted VOC distributions from the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model point to large uncertainties in our current understanding of the atmospheric ethene budget as well as to underestimated HCN, ethyne, and methanol sources."

Bowring;Ana Bastos;Florent Mouillot;Jiaying He;Minxuan Sun;Lei Zhu;Xiaomeng Du;Nan Wang;Xiaomeng Huang,Reconstructed global monthly burned area maps from 1901 to 2020,"To address the limitations of short time spans in satellite data and spatiotemporal discontinuity in site records, we reconstructed global monthly burned area maps at a half-degree resolution for 1901–2020 using machine learning models. The global burned area is predicted at 3.46–4.58 million km² per year, showing a decline from 1901 to 1978, an increase from 1978 to 2008, and a sharper decrease from 2008 to 2020. This dataset provides a benchmark for studies on fire ecology and carbon cycle. 
 Fire is a key Earth System process, driving variability in the global carbon cycle through CO2 emissions into the atmosphere and subsequent CO2 uptake through vegetation recovery after fires. Global spatiotemporally consistent datasets on burned area are available since the beginning of the satellite era in the 1980s but are sparse prior to that date. In this study, we reconstructed global monthly burned area at a resolution of 0.5°×0.5° from 1901 to 2020 using machine learning models trained against satellite observed burned area between 2003 and 2020, with the goal of reconstructing long-term burned area information to constrain historical fire simulations. We first conducted a classification model to separate grid cells with extreme (burned area > the 90th percentile in a given region) and regular fires, and then trained separate regression models for grid cells with extreme or regular fires. Both the classification and regression models were trained against a satellite-based burned area product (FireCCI51) based on explanatory variables related to climate, vegetation, and human activities. The trained models can well reproduce the long-term spatial patterns (slopes = 0.70–1.28 and R2 = 0.75–0.98 spatially), inter-annual variability and seasonality of the satellite-based burned area observations. After applying the trained model to the historical period, the predicted annual global total burned area ranges from 3.46 to 4.58 million km2 yr-1 (M km2 yr-1) over 1901–2020 with regular and extreme fires accounting for 1.36–1.74 and 2.00–3.03 M km2 yr-1 respectively. Our models estimate a global decrease in burned area during 1901–1978 (slope = -0.009 M km2 yr-2), followed by an increase during 1978–2008 (slope = 0.020 M km2 yr-2) and then a stronger decline in 2008–2020 (slope = -0.049 M km2 yr-2). Africa was the continent with largest burned area globally during 1901–2020, and its trends also dominated the global trends. We validated our predictions against charcoal records, and our product exhibits a high overall accuracy in fire occurrence (>80 %) in boreal North America, southern Europe, South America, Africa and southeast Australia, but the overall accuracy is relatively lower in northern Europe and Asia (<50 %). In addition, we compared our burned area data with multiple independent regional burned area maps in Canada, USA, Brazil, Chile and Europe, and found general consistency in the spatial patterns (linear regression slopes ranging 0.84–1.38 spatially) and the inter-annual variability.

The inventory is made by the harmonization and blending of seven regional inventories, gapfilled using the most recent release of EDGAR (EDGARv8). By incorporating the best available local information, the HTAP_v3.1 mosaic inventory can be used for policy-relevant studies at both regional and global levels. 
 This study, performed under the umbrella of the Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution (TF-HTAP), responds to the need of the global and regional atmospheric modelling community of having a mosaic emission inventory of air pollutants that conforms to specific requirements: global coverage, long time series, spatially distributed emissions with high time resolution, and a high sectoral resolution. The mosaic approach of integrating official regional emission inventories based on locally reported data, with a global inventory based on a globally consistent methodology, allows modellers to perform simulations of a high scientific quality while also ensuring that the results remain relevant to policymakers."

The results generally exhibit reasonable agreement with field observations in northern China, demonstrating the model's capability to simulate snow properties, including concentrations of reservoir species. 
 Snow is a key component of the cryosphere and has significant impacts on surface energy balance, hydrology, atmospheric circulation, etc. In addition, numerous studies have indicated that snow impurities, especially nitrate, are sensitive to sunlight and can be photolyzed to emit reactive species including NO2 and HONO, which serve as precursors of O3 and radicals and disturb the overlying atmospheric chemistry. This makes snow a reservoir of reactive species, and this reservoir is particularly important in remote and pristine regions with limited anthropogenic emissions. The magnitude of snow chemical emissions is also influenced by snow physical properties, including snow depth, density, and concentrations of light-absorbing impurities (e.g., black carbon (BC) and dust). Exploring and elucidating the emissions and atmospheric consequences of the snow-sourced reactive species require a global or regional model with a snow module. Here, we parameterized atmospheric nitrate deposition and its distributions in snow using a regional chemical transport model, i.e., WRF-Chem (Weather Research and Forecasting Model coupled with Chemistry), and evaluated the performance of WRF-Chem in simulating snow cover; snow depth; and BC, dust, and nitrate concentrations with field observations in northern China, which is one of the regions with a dense  and prolonged snow cover. In general, the model-simulated spatial variability in nitrate mass concentrations in the top snow layer (hereafter NITS) is consistent with observations. Simulated NITS values in northeast China from December 2017 to March 2018 had a maximum range of 7.11–16.58 µg g−1, minimum range of 0.06–0.21 µg g−1, and 4-month average of 2.72 ± 1.34 µg g−1. In comparison, observed values showed a maximum range of 9.35–33.43 µg g−1, minimum range of 0.09–0.51 µg g−1, and average of 3.74 ± 5.42 µg g−1. The model results show an underestimation especially in regions closes to large cities in northeastern China, most likely due to the underestimation of NOx emissions in these regions. Additionally, nitrate deposition, snowpack accumulation processes, and challenges in capturing fine-scale emission variability may also contribute to the bias. These results illustrate the ability of WRF-Chem to simulate snow properties including concentrations of reservoir species in northern China, and in the future, we will incorporate snow nitrate photolysis in the model, exploring the emissions of snow NOx from nitrate photolysis and the impacts on local and regional atmospheric chemistry and air pollutant transformations."

However, the emission characteristics of intermediate-volatility and semivolatile organic compounds (I/SVOCs) and their role in secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation remain unclear. In this study, the nonmethane organic gas (NMOG) emissions from various petrochemical processes were analyzed using two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC-ToF-MS) and a novel semiquantitative methodology based on carbon number and functional group. Results showed significant variations in NMOG emission factors (EFs) and chemical speciation profiles, with the isophthalic acid production process being the highest (43.5 ± 30.9 g/t) and the phenol and acetone production process being the lowest (2.1 ± 0.7 g/t). Notably, I/SVOCs constituted 82.2% of emissions in the isophthalic acid production process. Oxygen-containing compounds were the dominant species in all tested processes, accounting for 55.0%–76.6% of I/SVOCs emissions. In addition, the contribution of I/SVOCs to SOA formation potential (SOAFP) ranged from 75.8% to 96.9%, with oxygenated aromatics being key contributors.

Metallic Ag nanoparticles (Agn0) have been identified as the critical active site for O3 decomposition over Ag/MnOx catalysts. However, the role of Agn0 over Ag/MnOx catalysts during the O3 decomposition remains unclear. In this study, Agn0 and oxidized Ag nanoparticles (AgOx) are constructed on the MnO2 supports. Under a relative humidity of 65% and a high space velocity of 2800 L·g–1·h–1, the conversion of 40 ppm of O3 over the 4%Ag/γ-MnO2 catalyst (91%) within 6 h is far superior to that over the 4%Ag/α-MnO2 (22%) catalyst, which is attributed to the formation of Agn0 on the 4%Ag/γ-MnO2 catalyst and AgOx on the 4%Ag/α-MnO2 catalyst. Then, the role of Agn0 and AgOx during O3 decomposition was determined by in situ Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Compared with AgOx, the competitive adsorption of H2O and O3 molecules on Agn0 is weaker, and O3 molecules can be activated more rapidly on Agn0; most importantly, peroxide species are more easily desorbed on Agn0. These advantages of Agn0 are the key to the superior O3 decomposition activity of the 4%Ag/γ-MnO2 catalyst under humid gas. This study provides guidance for understanding the Ag active sites for the decomposition of O3 and the design of highly efficient Ag/MnOx catalysts."

The results show that drought characteristics did not change significantly over time in most basins, but the frequency tended to decrease in the Middle East and North Africa and showed increase at high latitudes. Droughts in Amazon, Nile and La Plata basins are severer than other basins with higher severities on the whole.

Both reanalysis data set and model simulations show that the reduction of Antarctic sea ice during early austral winter leads to a northward displacement of the tropospheric mid‐latitude jet, resembling the negative phase of the Southern Annular Mode. Meanwhile, the reduction of sea ice induces a weaker Antarctic stratospheric polar vortex during winter, which is accompanied by a weaker polar night jet. Further analysis indicates that the Antarctic sea ice reduction could lead to a greater excitation of Rossby waves and significant positive geopotential height anomalies over the Antarctic continent. The zonal wave 1 and 2 components of geopotential height anomalies are in phase with the climatology, corresponding to enhanced upward propagation of wave activity flux in early austral winter. Meanwhile, the reduction of sea ice in early austral winter could result in a more favorable atmospheric environment for the propagation of planetary waves into the stratosphere. These processes ultimately weaken the Antarctic stratospheric polar vortex and the polar night jet in winter. The reduction of sea ice in the Amundsen Sea sector enhances the upward propagation of planetary wave, while the reduction of sea ice in the Indian Ocean sector has the opposite effect."

Understanding factors controlling this transformation is the key for improving MCAO cloud representation in climate models. This study employs large‐eddy simulations to investigate how cloud ice number concentrations (Ni ${N}_{i}$) affect cloud evolution using a case from the Cold‐Air Outbreaks in the Marine Boundary Layer Experiment (COMBLE) campaign. The simulations, performed in a Lagrangian framework following an air mass trajectory, are driven by ERA5 reanalysis data. Initially, all simulations produce similar cloud patterns, but higher Ni ${N}_{i}$ leads to earlier breakup of cloud rolls. Between 4 and 10 hr, surface precipitation rates are similar across simulations, but precipitation initiates earlier, and the cloud‐base precipitation rates are higher when Ni ${N}_{i}$ is higher. The stronger precipitation evaporation leads to increased stability of the boundary layer and reduced intensity of vertical mixing between the surface and cloud layer. An increased sink of cloud layer moisture via precipitation and decreased source through diminished vertical transport result in earlier cloud breakup in higher Ni ${N}_{i}$ conditions. Simulations with different sea surface temperatures (SST) indicate that this cloud breakup mechanism remains valid for MCAOs of different strengths, although the cloud organization is more sensitive to SST changes in low Ni ${N}_{i}$ environments. This work highlights the importance of accurate representations of ice processes in simulating MCAO clouds and suggests the need for observational constraints of ice nucleating particles and Ni ${N}_{i}$ over the mixed‐phase cloud regimes."

Whicker‐Clarke,Improved Representations of Longwave Surface Emissivity to Reduce Surface and Atmospheric Heating Biases in Earth System Models,"Many Earth system models (ESMs) approximate surface emissivity as a broadband constant. This approximation reduces the computational burden, yet omits the spectral structure of emissivity and atmospheric absorption. Neglecting spectral variation in surface emission introduces biases in longwave (LW) atmospheric fluxes and heating. Biases are strongest over surfaces with strongly varying emissivity and minimal atmospheric opacity. We examine these biases over water, ice, and snow surfaces. We partition spectral emissivity into the 16 spectral bands utilized by a single‐column atmospheric radiative transfer model (RRTMG_LW) commonly used in ESMs. We quantify flux and heating biases introduced by broadband assumptions relative to the spectrally resolved case for standard atmospheric profiles over each surface type. Current assumptions tend to overestimate upwelling surface fluxes; for example, the greybody assumption overestimates flux by 1.6 W/m2 (∼ ${\sim} $0.52%) at the bottom of a mid‐latitude winter atmosphere over ice, and by 2.33 W/m2 ${\text{W/m}}^{2}$ (∼ ${\sim} $1.0%) at the top of atmosphere. The blackbody assumption tends to artificially cool Earth's surface, stabilizing the lower troposphere. Interestingly, the optimal broadband emissivity can deviate from the Planck‐weighted mean by up to 3% depending on surface type and atmospheric profile. We investigate bias sensitivity to surface temperature, cloud water path, and atmospheric water vapor. Bias is most sensitive to water vapor content, and least sensitive to cloud water path. Lastly, we show that a modified greybody method with updated broadband values can reduce total surface flux bias up to 1.69 W/m2 ${\text{W/m}}^{2}$, comparable to a five‐band approach and at a fraction of the computational cost."

Guarin;Gerrit Hoogenboom;Jonas Jägermeyr,Maize Yield Changes Under Sulfate Aerosol Climate Intervention Using Three Global Gridded Crop Models,"As the severity of climate change and its associated impacts continue to worsen, schemes for artificially cooling surface temperatures via planetary albedo modification are being studied. The method with the most attention in the literature is stratospheric sulfate aerosol intervention (SAI). Placing reflective aerosols in the stratosphere would have profound impacts on the entire Earth system, with potentially far‐reaching societal impacts. How global crop productivity would be affected by such an intervention strategy is still uncertain, and existing evidence is based on theoretical experiments or isolated modeling studies that use crop models missing key processes associated with SAI that affect plant growth, development, and ultimately yield. Here, we utilize three global gridded process‐based crop models to better understand the potential impacts of one SAI scenario on global maize productivity. Two of the crop models that simulate diffuse radiation fertilization show similar, yet small increases in global maize productivity from increased diffuse radiation. Three crop models show diverse responses to the same climate perturbation from SAI relative to the reference future climate change scenario. We find that future SAI implementation relative to a climate change scenario benefits global maize productivity ranging between 0% and 11% depending on the crop model. These production increases are attributed to reduced surface temperatures and higher fractions of diffuse radiation. The range across model outcomes highlights the need for more systematic multi‐model ensemble assessments using multiple climate model forcings under different SAI scenarios."

The formation mechanism of these clouds is associated with random, local perturbations that create buoyant parcels. Their sparseness suggests no or very weak interactions between clouds.

Krol,Linear integrated mass enhancement: A method for estimating hotspot emission rates from space-based plume observations,"•A new methodology for hotspot emission estimation. •The method is applied to real and synthetic satellite data. •The emission estimates are consistent with known values. 
 In this paper, we propose a new methodology for plume inversion emission estimation termed linear integrated mass enhancement (LIME). As the name implies, this approach is based on the integrated mass enhancement (IME) method and on the linear relationship between IME and the distance from the source. The proposed approach accounts for the information coming from different portions of the plume, and it can be seen as a “combination” of the cross-sectional flux (CSF) method and IME. The method offers a straightforward way to estimate the source strength by determining the slope of the linear fit. We test the LIME approach with both real (OCO-3, S5P/TROPOMI, Sentinel-2) and simulated (MicroHH, SMARTCARB) satellite data. We apply the method to the simulated carbon dioxide (CO2) observations for the upcoming CO2M mission over the Matimba and Jänschwalde power stations with known source rates. We use the OCO-3 data to estimate the CO2 emissions originating from the Bełchatów power station in Poland (between 72 and 103 ktCO2/d). We also estimate the emissions from two methane (CH4) leaking sites in Algeria based on S5P/TROPOMI (77 and 47 tCH4/h for two days) and Sentinel-2 (7.7 tCH4/h) observations. Finally, we apply the LIME method to the Sentinel-2 retrievals from a controlled CH4 release in Arizona. Across all case studies, the LIME emission estimates are in agreement with the expected values. The LIME estimates are also aligned with the state-of-the-art IME emission estimates, which are calculated as byproducts in the LIME emission estimation process."

 This paper presents the first-ever continental-scale convection-permitting simulations over South America for three water years of different ENSO phases, corresponding to an ENSO neutral year (2018/19), an EI Niño year (2015/16), and a La Niña year (2010/11), using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model at 4-km grid spacing. The model performance has been validated against precipitation derived from satellite, surface observations, and surface air temperature from reanalysis. The evaluation shows a promising skill at reproducing the observed multi-scale spatiotemporal characteristics of precipitation and temperature, such as the seasonal and sub-seasonal variability, the diverse patterns of diurnal cycle, and deep convective clouds. Sensitivity simulations quantify the impacts of cumulus parameterization, grid spacing, and spectral nudging. Results indicate that a tested scale-aware convection scheme has little benefit, and the model performance degrades as horizontal resolution decreases. Spectral nudging can reduce the precipitation bias over some tropical and subtropical regions but exacerbates the wet bias over the Andean Mountains. A noteworthy model deficiency shared in all simulations is the excess orographic precipitation, a problem in association with the overly active afternoon-evening convection possibly resultant from under-representation of clouds and missing cloud-aerosol interaction, though the uncertainty of observational data might contribute to the wet bias as well. These results provide useful guidance for improving the model physics. The overall encouraging agreement between the 4-km model simulations and observations provides confidence in the usage of the established model configuration for regional climate downscaling and climate change projections over South America."

 We present the first comprehensive multiyear global mapping of offshore lighting structures derived from low-light imaging satellite observations collected at night. The sensor is the day–night band (DNB) flown as part of the NASA/NOAA Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The product merges two operational nighttime light products: VIIRS boat detection (VBD) data and VIIRS cloud-free nighttime light (VNL) data. The two products are spatially complementary, making it possible to fill gaps through a merger. Both product sets have an average DNB radiance layer, and the merger involves preserving the higher of the two average radiances. A wide range of lighting structures is present, i.e., fishing grounds, platforms, anchorages, gas flares, transit routes, and the glow surrounding bright lighting onshore. The richness of the numbers and types of offshore lighting structures can be traced back to the DNB spike detector at the core of the VBD algorithm. The VNL algorithm uses outlier removal to filter out biomass burning, an essential process for mapping electric lighting onshore. The outlier removal drops about 80 % of the offshore lighting detections. We expect that the new product will lead to an improved understanding of fishing grounds, offshore light pollution, and supply chain disruptions at anchorages, thereby aiding in the development of more sustainable and efficient practices.

We develop a new index that incorporates information on urban trees' health and function, in addition to their presence. This index, when applied across MSP, suggests that canopy benefits may not be distributed equally even in neighborhoods with similar canopy cover. Furthermore, accounting for tree health and function can yield more effective and equitable benefits by guiding the location and magnitude of intervention for urban tree management."

The diurnal offshore precipitation propagation begins slowly (3–10 m s−1) near the coast of NWSA (<200 km) but accelerates significantly (∼20 m s−1) and shows an afternoon enhancement far from the coast (>400 km). However, the driving mechanisms behind this long‐distance precipitation propagation remain unclear. Using a new cloud tracking and classification data set, we found that mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are the dominant precipitation contributors in the offshore region of NWSA. Cloud tracking shows that the long‐distance propagation and the afternoon enhancement of diurnal precipitation primarily originate from MCSs initiated in the early morning, either over open oceans or from the coast of Central America. Composite tendency analysis shows that MCSs initiated near the coast of Central America have significant upward cooling and moistening signals starting from the surface before initiation. Further analysis of surface diurnal perturbation fields indicates that the land breeze is the primary driving mechanism for MCS initiation. Conversely, for MCSs initiated over open oceans, a significant downward cooling signal from 400 hPa is observed ∼7 hr before initiation, corresponding to the passage of diurnal gravity waves emitted from the Andes. Additionally, our findings highlight the critical role of lower and mid‐level moisture conditions in MCS initiation, alongside the influence of gravity waves."

 Pronounced model-observation discrepancies in the changes of tropical Pacific zonal sea surface temperature gradient during the satellite era imply systematic model deficiencies. However, the relatively short high-quality instrumental record hampers robustly determining the response of tropical Pacific sea surface temperature to greenhouse gas increases. By adopting paleoclimate proxy records along with a series of climate model simulations, here we show that the zonal gradient is likely to decrease under sustained strong forcing. Paleoclimate proxy records indicate an overall increase of the zonal gradient over time, which has been accompanied by global-mean cooling associated with decreasing carbon dioxide concentrations. Model simulations are found to broadly reproduce the distinct contrast between warmer high carbon dioxide climates and the opposite climates, albeit with large inter-model discrepancy. The qualitative agreement among paleoclimate proxy records and modeled representations therefore lends some important credence to the sign of model-projected future tropical Pacific mean state change. Under sustained strong forcing, the tropical Pacific zonal sea surface temperature gradient is predicted to decrease, while paleoclimate proxy records show an increase over time with decreasing carbon dioxide concentrations, resembling warmer high carbon dioxide climates and colder periods with lower carbon dioxide, according to paleoclimate proxy records and climate model simulation results."

 Atmospheric aerosols are a major component of the earth's climate system and modulate air quality at local and regional scales. One region that has seen little attention is the South Pacific, despite air quality being of increasing concern for human health in Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs). A review of literature on sources of pollution emissions in the Pacific region reveals that while most of the studies have focused on specific emission events, the annual cycle and long-term variability of the different aerosol types is rarely considered. Hence, this study provides a regional overview of aerosols over the Pacific using two global reanalyses (NASA/MERRA-2 and ECMWF/CAMS) and one satellite-based product (VIIRS). The uncertainties of the different data sources are discussed. The spatio-temporal variability of total Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and different aerosol species is shown and discussed in relation to the pollution sources previously investigated. In general, CAMS exhibits a higher total AOD (0.11) compared to MERRA-2 (0.09), both lower than VIIRS (0.12). Both reanalyses show that sea salt is the predominant aerosol source in the region, whereas sulphates and organic matter aerosols are also significant pollution sources, particularly over the islands in Melanesia. Both reanalyses capture the annual variation of AOD similarly, with higher total AOD levels occurring from September to February (SON and DJF), and lower levels from March to May (MAM). Besides capturing the aerosols seasonal variability, both reanalyses also capture extreme aerosol peaks, which evidence the long-range transport of dust from the Australian outback, black carbon and organic matter from major Australian bushfires, and sulphates from volcanic eruptions. This study serves as a baseline for further air quality assessment in the PICTs, considering that the seasonal variation presented here has not been thoroughly analyzed before but can be expected to play an important role in regional atmospheric and ocean biochemistry as well as potential impacts on human health in the Pacific."

 Submicron particles (PM1) play a critical role in air quality, climate, and human health. Long-term monitoring is essential to identify changes in atmospheric composition driven by natural or anthropogenic emissions and processes. This study presents ten years of continuous measurements (Sept. 2012–Aug. 2022) at the TROPOS Melpitz research station in Germany, a Central European rural background site influenced by its location between Eastern and Western Europe. Using an aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM) and a multi-angle absorption photometer (MAAP), alongside a rolling positive matrix factorization (PMF) model for organic aerosol (OA) source apportionment, we analyzed PM1 trends, chemical composition, and source contributions over a decade. The results reveal a significant negative PM1 trend of −4.59% y−1, with pronounced decreases occurring in fall and winter. Eastern air masses showed marked improvements (−28% y−1), likely reflecting regional mitigation policies. OA, contributing 44% of total PM1, showed a negative trend of −2.05% y−1 and comprised three primary OA (POA) sources—hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), biomass burning OA (BBOA), and coal combustion OA (CCOA)—and two oxygenated OA (OOA) factors (less-oxidized and more-oxidized OA, LO-OOA and MO-OOA). HOA (7% of total OA) remained relatively stable, with a minor decline (−0.25% y−1) under Eastern air masses. In contrast, BBOA (10% of OA) and CCOA (12% of OA) displayed strong seasonality, driven by residential heating and energy production. Notably, BBOA increased by +0.48 % y−1 during summer, likely due to the rise in wood pellet heating, recreative, and/or wildfires, while CCOA showed a modest increase (+0.27% y−1) in Western air masses. The OOA factors, LO-OOA and MO-OOA (31% and 40% of OA, respectively), reflected distinct seasonal patterns tied to atmospheric formation pathways. Both showed declining trends in Eastern air masses (−1.52% y−1 and −1.09% y−1), indicating changes in biogenic emissions and/or anthropogenic precursors. Finally, eBC(PM1) decreased by −1.3 % y−1 with strong source dependency. Compared to urban areas, the overall decrease of PM mass concentration and anthropogenic OA looks limited, emphasizing a potentially lower effect of political mitigation outside cities. Overall, the findings underscore the importance of monitoring long-term changes in PM1 composition and sources, which are crucial for understanding aerosol physical properties, refining climate models and public health, and evaluating the impacts of mitigation efforts on air quality and climate in different environments. Further studies on a similar approach are strongly needed to better understand the geographical variation of the aerosol chemical composition and evaluate their potential effect."

 We present the extension of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) Infrared Microwave Sounding (IMS) optimal estimation retrieval scheme to include the use of far-infrared channels in preparation for the upcoming Far-infrared Outgoing Radiation Understanding and Monitoring (FORUM) mission. The IMS code has been previously applied to mid-infrared spectral radiances measured by the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Instrument (IASI) to retrieve temperature and water vapour.  Given this, the evolution and evaluation of the extended scheme is performed in two steps. First, clear-sky retrievals of temperature and water vapour are performed on IASI and FORUM simulations. Comparable retrieval biases are observed for retrievals of temperature and water vapour; however, there is an increase of ∼ 1 degree of freedom for water vapour and temperature for the FORUM configuration. Secondly, radiances observed from an aircraft flight in the upper troposphere are modified to match the FORUM spectral characteristics. Retrievals from these radiances using the modified code show a strong agreement with contemporaneous in situ measurements of the atmospheric state, reducing the root-mean-square error (RMSE) by 18 % for water vapour from the a priori, giving confidence in its performance.

Kanawade;Tuija Jokinen,Atmospheric amines are a crucial yet missing link in Earth’s climate via airborne aerosol production,"Amines, ubiquitous atmospheric compounds that are emitted from a range of natural and anthropogenic sources, play a key role in enhancing aerosol formation and activating cloud condensation nuclei, yet are under-represented in climate models and require future high-precision measurement. 
 Atmospheric amines, derivatives of ammonia, play a unique yet not fully understood role in air quality, climate and public health. Sub-5 parts per trillion Volume (pptV, <10-12 in volume) mixing ratios of amines facilitate the physical and/or chemical transformation of aerosols in the atmosphere, enhancing aerosol formation and growth rates, aerosol hygroscopicity, and the activation of cloud condensation nuclei. This serves as the initial step for cloud droplet formation and, consequently, influences cloud properties and the hydrological cycle. Ambient observations demonstrate more than a thousand-fold particle formation rates in the presence of amines as compared to ammonia. Yet, the challenges related to detecting minute levels of amines, the paucity of ambient amine measurements, and the limited process-based understanding of airborne aerosol production have resulted in amines being underrepresented in global climate models. Therefore, advanced techniques with extremely low detection limits and highly spatially and temporally resolved ambient amine measurements globally in diverse environments are essential. Amines, ubiquitous atmospheric compounds that are emitted from a range of natural and anthropogenic sources, play a key role in enhancing aerosol formation and activating cloud condensation nuclei, yet are under-represented in climate models and require future high-precision measurement."

Williams;Nicolas Theys;Athanasios Tsikerdekis;Pieternel F. Levelt,SO2 emissions derived from TROPOMI observations over India using a flux-divergence method with variable lifetimes,"There is a lack of local SO2 top-down emission inventories in India. With the improvement in the divergence method and the derivation of SO2 local lifetime, gridded SO2 emissions over a large area can be estimated efficiently. This method can be applied to any region in the world to derive SO2 emissions. Especially for regions with high latitudes, our methodology has the potential to significantly improve the top-down derivation of SO2 emissions. 
 The rapid development of the economy and the implementation of environmental policies adapted in India have led to fast changes of regional SO2 emissions. We present a monthly SO2 emission inventory for India covering December 2018 to November 2023 based on the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) Level-2 COBRA SO2 dataset, using an improved flux-divergence method and estimated local SO2 lifetime, which includes both its chemical loss and dry deposition. We update the methodology to use the daily CAMS model output estimates of the hydroxyl-radical distribution as well as the measured dry deposition velocity to account for the variability in the tropospheric SO2 lifetime. It is the first effort to derive the local SO2 lifetime for application in the divergence method. The results show the application of the local SO2 lifetime improves the accuracy of SO2 emissions estimation when compared to calculations using a constant lifetime. Our improved flux-divergence method reduced the spreading of the point-source emissions compared to the standard flux-divergence method. Our derived averaged SO2 emissions covering the recent 5 years are about 5.2 Tg yr−1 with a monthly mean uncertainty of 40 %, which is lower than the bottom-up emissions of 11.0 Tg yr−1 from CAMS-GLOB-ANT v5.3. The total emissions from the 92 largest point-source emissions are estimated to be 2.9 Tg yr−1, lower than the estimation of 5.2 Tg yr−1 from the global SO2 catalog MSAQSO2LV4. We claim that the variability in the SO2 lifetime is important to account for in estimating top-down SO2 emissions."

In this study, we introduce a new airborne eddy covariance platform (Schleicher ASK-16) and demonstrate that this platform is able to accurately measure turbulent fluxes and wind vectors. Data from this platform can help to build bridges between local tower measurements and remote-sensing-based products. 
 Airborne eddy covariance measurements can bridge the gap between local (tower-based) and regional (satellite/inversion-derived) flux data, as they provide information about the spatial distribution of turbulent fluxes for larger regions. Here, we introduce an airborne eddy covariance measurement platform based on an ASK-16 touring motor glider (TMG; also referred to as a power glider, hereafter referred to as motorized glider), which is equipped to measure the three-dimensional (3D) wind vector, and atmospheric conditions, and we derive airborne turbulent fluxes for the use of measurement campaigns over European landscapes. This study describes the measurement setup of the platform and explains the workflows that were used to calculate and calibrate the 3D wind vector, turbulent fluxes, and their associated source areas. The glider is equipped with an 858 AJ Rosemount five-hole probe, a Picarro G2311-f gas analyzer, a Novatel FlexPak G2-V2 GNSS–INS system, Vaisala temperature and humidity sensors (HMT311), and an OMEGA CHAL-003 thermocouple temperature sensor. Measurement data are processed with PyWingpod (Python) and eddy4R (R) software packages to calculate wind vectors and turbulent fluxes and assign footprints to the calculated fluxes. To evaluate the quality of the obtained fluxes, different quality assessments have been performed, including the determination of detection limits, spectral analysis, stationarity tests, the analysis of integral turbulence characteristics, and measurement noise and error evaluation. The uncertainty of w is between 0.15 and 0.27 m s−1  (median = 0.23 m s−1), and the uncertainty of u and v ranges between 0.16 and 0.55 m s−1 (median = 0.25 m s−1). Analysis of exemplary flux data from flight transects indicates that the platform is capable of producing spatially highly resolved turbulent fluxes over heterogeneous landscapes. Overall, results from our analysis suggest that the ASK-16 airborne platform can measure turbulent fluxes with a similar quality to earlier established high-quality platforms."

Cusworth,Using new geospatial data and 2020 fossil fuel methane emissions for the Global Fuel Exploitation Inventory (GFEI) v3,"We present an update of the Global Fuel Exploitation Inventory (GFEI), a global inventory of methane emissions from oil, gas, and coal exploitation. GFEI v3 uses emissions as reported by countries in national inventories for 2020, and new infrastructure information, including a new dataset on coal mine locations. The goal of updating GFEI is to provide a more accurate spatial representation of the country-reported national inventories, allowing comparison with methane monitoring data. 
 The Global Fuel Exploitation Inventory (GFEI) is a global 0.1° x 0.1° resolution gridded inventory of methane emissions from oil, gas, and coal exploitation. Here, we present GFEI v3 with updated national emissions to 2020 using reports submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), leading to new global emissions of 23, 20, and 31 Tg a-1 for oil, gas, and coal, respectively. We also use new geospatial information from the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Mapping database (OGIM v1) for spatial distribution of global oil-gas methane emissions. We use coal mine locations from the Global Energy Monitor’s Global Coal Mine Tracker (GCMT), combined with our own estimates for mine-level methane emissions, to distribute national emissions between coal mine locations. Our mine-level methane emission estimates use country specific emission factors for top producing countries supplemented with modeled emission factors based on coal mine depth and grade. We see the greatest change in the spatial distribution of emissions in GFEI v3 compared to v2 in China due to the use of GCMT for coal mine locations. Large point source plumes (super-emitters) observed by the NASA EMIT instrument are co-located with infrastructure identified in GFEI v3, but the magnitude of the measured emissions is poorly correlated with the gridded emissions in GFEI. This may reflect missing or misrepresented sources in GFEI v3 but also the sporadic nature of the super-emitter measurements used here. By aligning GFEI v3 with national UNFCCC reports and using state-of-the-science geospatial information, the inventory can be confronted with satellite observations of atmospheric methane through inverse modeling to evaluate and improve the UNFCCC reports. We plan to continue updating GFEI to align with reported national emissions and new geospatial information, including assessment of GFEI spatial accuracy through comparison to super-emitter detections. GFEI v3 emission grids by sector and subsector are available at https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HH4EUM (Scarpelli et al., 2024)."

These parameters were calculated based on the reaction rates and online observations of VOCs, nitrogen dioxide, and O3 concentrations at Deyang, Chengdu, and Meishan in the Chengdu Plain, China, during summer 2019. The nighttime isoprene consumption was maximum at 2.03 ppbv at Meishan. The daytime acetaldehyde consumption was a maximum at 2.68 ppbv at Deyang, possibly due to its higher primary emissions and secondary production and its consumption by both OH radicals and photolysis. When the ratios of the total consumed VOC concentrations to the observed or initial NOx (NOx = NO + NO2) concentrations were 3.51 ppbv ppbv–1 or 2.22 ppbv ppbv–1, daytime O3 variations reached a maximum of 8.45 ppbv or 7.52 ppbv, respectively. The ratios delineated the VOC-sensitive and NOx-sensitive areas. Over 98% of hourly data were in VOC-sensitive areas at both Chengdu and Meishan, respectively, while over 14% of hourly data belonged to NOx-sensitive areas at Deyang. This provided a more accurate method for assessing real-time O3 sensitivity and thus implementing dynamic hierarchical control strategies."

Scollo,Ash and Ice Aggregation in Satellite Retrieval: The 15 January 2022 Hunga Tonga‐Hunga Ha'apai Hydromagmatic Eruption,"Explosive volcanic eruptions inject volcanic particles, such as ash and water vapor, into the atmosphere. Ice enriched volcanic clouds can hide the presence of silicate particles, intensifying the fatal risks for aviation. In this scenario, satellite monitoring systems play a key role in volcanic hazard mitigation. Thanks to the full disk perspective over the Pacific Ocean, the GOES‐17 geostationary satellite observed the 15 January 2022 Hunga Tonga‐Hunga Ha'apai hydromagmatic eruption. The explosive activity produced two volcanic clouds dispersing at different altitudes. In this work, we first focus on the altitude estimates of the two volcanic clouds, by means of volcanic cloud speed and wind components. Next, we study how the fine ash (< ${< } $64 μm diameter) total mass in atmosphere varies depending on the assumed fraction of ash and ice in an aggregate. Based on our estimates, the upper volcanic cloud disperses between 27.35 ± $\pm $ 3.01 and 29.13 ± $\pm $ 3.20 km altitude; the lower cloud between 14.02 ± $\pm $ 1.54 and 14.8 ± $\pm $ 1.63 km altitude. The estimated fine ash total mass doubles if we consider spherical aggregates instead of irregular aggregates, due to a tighter packing of coating particles. The highest estimated fine ash mass for the upper and lower clouds is of 3.81⋅108±1.41⋅108 $3.81\cdot 1{0}^{8}\pm 1.41\cdot 1{0}^{8}$ kg (12:40 UTC) and of 11.61⋅108±4.30⋅108 $11.61\cdot 1{0}^{8}\ \pm 4.30\cdot 1{0}^{8}$ kg (13:50 UTC), respectively. Estimating the exact amount of erupted fine ash mass, mainly during hydromagmatic eruptions, is challenging and further works should investigate aggregates where the ice fraction is higher than the ash fraction."

However, warm rain is rarely observed in urban polluted atmospheric environments due to high number concentrations of aerosols generally suppress the occurrence of warm rain. Three aircraft observation of clouds were used during summer in Beijing area. Here, we documented warm rain processes similar to shallow marine clouds in the urban (Beijing) atmospheric environment after cleansing air pollution by extensive precipitation observed on 11 September 2019. Our results showed that, compared with aircraft observations of similar cumulus clouds under polluted conditions, large‐scale precipitation can efficiently scavenge air pollution in Beijing and lead to marine‐like clouds with warm rain. The average aerosol concentration (Na) near the cloud base in these clean cases was only 225 cm−3 with cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) of 36 cm−3, (maximum of 142 cm−3) which led to enhanced coalescence. The warm rain was initiated at 600 m above the cloud base. Our results highlight the significance of pollution scavenging by precipitation in warm rain production in urban environment."

This paper tried to comprehensively review the machine learning (ML)-based high-resolution traffic-air quality (TAQ) models and provide valuable insights for the development and application. The advancements in ML-based TAQ models are highlighted via our analysis of 103 studies from 2013 to 2023, particularly for European regions where relevant research have increased significantly. The review summarized the prediction of urban air quality influenced by complicated on-road traffic conditions using various ML algorithms (e.g., tree-based and neural network algorithms). Additionally, we explored the sources of input datasets, feature applications and challenges associated with ML algorithms’ selection and application. Additionally, prospects were proposed for prioritizing interpretability in ML algorithms and the optimizing input metadata to improve the reliability and performance of ML-based TAQ models. Together with future research directions were also discussed, including real-time urban air quality evaluation and models facilitated concerned with health and economic effects. Aiming to advance ML-based TAQ models in this field, this review illustrates a brand-new roadmap for understanding the intricate relationship between urban on-road traffic and air quality dynamics."

Wennberg,Quantifying primary oxidation products in the OH-initiated reaction of benzyl alcohol,"We look at the atmospheric chemistry of a volatile chemical product (VCP), benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol and other VCPs may play a significant role in the formation of urban smog. By better understanding the chemistry of VCPs like benzyl alcohol, we may better understand observed data and how VCPs affect air quality. We identify products formed from benzyl alcohol chemistry and use this chemistry to understand how benzyl alcohol forms a key component of smog, secondary organic aerosol. 
 Benzyl alcohol is found in many volatile chemical products (VCPs) including a number of personal care products and industrial solvents. We report here on  the products of the gas-phase oxidation of benzyl alcohol by OH and its dependence on nitric oxide (NO) levels. Using a gas chromatography in tandem with a chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) and gas chromatographer with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID), we measure the branching fractions to the major gas-phase oxidation products: hydroxybenzyl alcohol (HBA) and benzaldehyde. Later-generation oxidation products from both HBA and benzaldehyde pathways are also observed. In particular, catechol is a major gas-phase product of HBA. The fraction of H abstraction from benzyl alcohol leading to benzaldehyde formation is unaffected by [NO], with an average branching fraction of (21±10) %. The fraction of OH addition leading to HBA formation (36±18) % also does not appear to vary with [NO]. Consistent with the known high SOA yields of catechol, we find that HBA has a very high secondary organic aerosol (SOA) yield. Thus, benzyl alcohol and its oxidation products efficiently produce secondary organic aerosol –  under some conditions approaching unity. Insights from the present study can help elucidate the chemistry of other atmospherically relevant aromatic compounds, especially those found in VCPs."

During heavy pollution in August 2019, we measured carbonyls at nine sites and analyzed their impact. Areas with higher carbonyl levels, like Chengdu, had worse ozone pollution. While their abundance matters, chemical reactions with other pollutants are the main drivers. Our findings show regional cooperation is vital to reducing ozone pollution effectively. 
 Gaseous carbonyl compounds serve as crucial precursors and intermediates in atmospheric photochemical reactions, significantly contributing to ambient ozone formation. To determine whether the impact of carbonyl compounds on regional ozone pollution is driven by their abundance or by specific secondary chemical processes, simultaneous field observations and observation-based modeling of ambient carbonyls were conducted at nine sites within the Chengdu Plain Urban Agglomeration (CPUA), China, during 4–18 August 2019, when three episodes of regional heavy ozone pollution occurred across eight cities within CPUA. Throughout the study, the total mixing ratios of 15 carbonyls ranged from 10.7 ± 4.2 to 35.2 ± 13.4 ppbv. The spatial distribution reveals that regions with higher concentrations of carbonyl compounds, such as around Chengdu, are also areas with more severe ozone pollution. Both the abundance and the chemical reactivity of carbonyl compounds, especially formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, play crucial roles in ozone formation in the CPUA. On ozone pollution days, carbonyl concentrations significantly increased by 22.8 % to 66.2 %. While the abundance of carbonyls is an important factor, their significant role in heavy ozone pollution within the CPUA is primarily driven by secondary chemical processes, particularly those involving alkenes and biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). Sites with higher average ozone concentrations during observations were mainly in the VOC-limited regime, while others were in the transitional regime. Additionally, the mutual transport of carbonyl compounds between cities in the CPUA suggests that regional collaboration is essential to address ozone pollution effectively. These findings offer valuable insights for developing effective strategies to control regional ozone pollution."

This dataset offers improved accuracy and detail compared to earlier versions, meeting high international standards for climate data. By refining how measurement errors are calculated and reduced over time and space, we provide clearer insights into pollution patterns. This work supports better air quality monitoring and informs actions to address pollution globally. 
 We introduce the new ESA Climate Change Initiative TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) global monthly Level 3 (L3) dataset of tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) for May 2018 to December 2021. The dataset provides spatiotemporally averaged tropospheric NO2 columns, associated averaging kernels and L3 uncertainties at spatial resolutions of 0.2°, 0.5°, and 1.0° on a monthly timescale (https://doi.org/10.21944/CCI-NO2-TROPOMI-L3). To improve our understanding of what fraction of the L2 uncertainty cancels when averaging over space or time (i.e. the random component of the L2 uncertainty) and what fraction persists despite the averaging (systematic component), we first determine spatial and temporal error correlations for all sources of uncertainty in the L2 retrieval. Spatial error correlations arise from the stratosphere-troposphere correction, and from coarse-gridded albedo climatologies used in the L2 air mass factor calculation. We find the temporal error correlation in both the stratospheric uncertainty and the air-mass factor uncertainty to be 30 %. Using these estimates, the L3 uncertainty budget has been established for every grid cell based on input L2 uncertainties and new methods to estimate spatial and temporal representativeness uncertainties and to propagate measurement uncertainties through space and time. The total relative uncertainty in the resulting Level 3 dataset is in the range of 15–20 % in polluted areas, which is significantly lower than in separate Level 2 orbit retrievals, and brings the tropospheric NO2 data to within the GCOS ""goal"" and ""breakthrough"" requirements. Validation of the (sub-)columns confirms better correlation and reduced dispersion in the differences between satellite and ground-based reference data for the L3 data w.r.t. the underlying L2, albeit with a more pronounced negative bias in the tropospheric columns at pollution hot spots, most probably related to stronger spatial smearing."

The data include three complete profiles of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and a storm in the South Atlantic. 
 During the Atlantic References and Convection (ARC) ship campaign with the reference MSM114/2, which took place in early 2023, the German research vessel Maria S. Merian travelled from Mindelo, Cape Verde, to Punta Arenas, Chile. One of the main objectives of ARC was to obtain vertically resolved cross sections of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). To this end, we crossed the ITCZ three times in the meridional direction. We present the atmospheric and oceanographic measurements collected during ARC in a standardised way to facilitate working with data from different instruments and to make the data easily accessible. This approach is not limited to ARC but could serve as a prototype for future (and past) ship campaigns. We present data from the integrated ship sensors (DSHIP); a humidity and temperature profiler (HATPRO); a ceilometer; aerosol instruments (DustTrak, Microtops, and Calitoo); radiosondes; uncrewed aircraft vehicles (UAVs); and conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) profiles of the upper ocean. We distinguish between temporal continuous data (DSHIP, HATPRO, Ceilometer, and DustTrak) from point measurements (radiosondes, UAVs, CTDs, Calitoo, and Microtops). To illustrate the data sets provided, we present examples of measurements taken during the three crossings of the ITCZ and during a storm in the Roaring Forties in the South Atlantic at the end of the campaign.

This two-stage time-stratified case-crossover study investigated the morbidity risks and burden of short-term NO2 exposure on major cause-specific hospital admissions (HAs) for respiratory diseases (RDs), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and kidney diseases in 291 Chinese cities of prefecture-level or above during 2013–2017, based on 47,182,205 HA records. For each 10 μg/m3 increase in NO2 at lag01, the overall percent changes in HAs ranged from 1.15% for asthma to 3.28% for chronic renal failure. Compared to NO2 concentrations <25 μg/m3, excess risks in HAs associated with exposure to NO2 concentrations ≥25 μg/m3 at lag01 ranged from 2.14% (acute coronary syndrome, ACS) to 4.56% (acute bronchitis). Total attributable fractions associated with short-term NO2 exposure ranged from 2.01% for ACS to 4.82% for chronic renal failure. Associations of NO2 with major cause-specific HAs were generally stronger at a low temperature than at a high temperature.

The average uptake coefficient of NO2 on organics during 1 h (γa) varied in the range of (1.1–8.0) × 10–6. Light led to an increase in γa by a factor of 2.2–11.5 times. HONO was generated by electron transfer from excited organics to NO2, as shown by the linear correlation of NO2 uptake and HONO formation with electron (e–) production from organics. Especially, the temporal variation of NO2 and HONO concentrations from the NO2 uptake on 9-methyl acridine (MA-N) showed a unique trend, where the NO2 uptake and HONO formation increased with time. The photochemical reaction of NO2 with MA-N generated nitrogen-/oxygen-containing species as well as demethylation species. The coexistence of oxygen-containing species, including acridone and hydroxy-methylacridine, had a synergistic effect on the photochemical conversion of NO2 to HONO. According to experimental results, it was speculated that the heterogeneous reaction between NO2 and organics could contribute to a HONO source strength lower than 660 ppt h–1 on the near-ground surface and lower than 92 ppt h–1 in the aloft air."

Despite reductions in PM2.5 since the 2013 Clean Air Act, the level of the O3 concentration has continued to rise in China, underscoring the need for targeted pollution control measures. This study examined the seasonal and spatial variations of pollutants and meteorological variables in a major industrial city in Eastern China. Three widely used approaches, including the ozone formation potential (OFP) calculation, an observation-based model (OBM), and a random forest algorithm, were employed to investigate O3 formation in urban environments. Results show that oxygenated volatile organic compounds were the most significant contributors to summer urban O3, whereas their impact was significantly reduced during the winter. Each O3 formation evaluation model provided unique insights, with OFP offering rapid estimates, the OBM revealing detailed chemistry, and random forest capturing nonlinear interactions. However, the study also identified limitations in these models. OFP failed to account for seasonal variations in the level of O3 formation, and the random forest model struggled to distinguish causal relationships from correlations. These findings highlight the need for caution when relying on a single model and underscore the importance of integrating multiple methods to gain an accurate understanding of urban O3 formation dynamics, which is crucial to developing effective control strategies."

In order to reduce instrumental baseline artifacts, the retrieval makes use of the difference of daytime and nighttime spectra (the nighttime ClO spectra are much smaller) to produce a day‐minus‐night ClO mixing ratio, which is the fundamental quantity analyzed throughout this study. Upper stratospheric ClO values peaked in ∼1997, and the trend in the upper stratospheric ChlOE measurements from 1997 to 2023 was found to be −0.4 ± 0.3%/yr (2σ). Comparisons of ChlOE measurements with a combined coincident Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) and Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) data set showed a relative trend of +0.3% ± 0.3%/yr (2σ) over 1992–2023, where a positive trend indicates that the ChlOE ClO measurements are increasing relative to those from MLS. Restricting the comparisons to ChlOE and Aura MLS over 2004–2023, resulted in relative trends that varied by pressure level, from +0.15%/yr to +0.42%/yr, all agreeing to within the 2σ uncertainty. Over the period 2004–2021, the average ChlOE trend for the three levels was −0.3 ± 0.4%/yr, but, with the addition of the unusually high ClO measured in 2022 and 2023 the trend from 2004 to 2023 became 0.0 ± 0.4%/yr. The increase in ClO during 2022 is, at least in part, caused by dynamical variations. The higher ClO in 2023 is closely correlated with the presence of increased H2O from the Hunga eruption, which affects the ClO chemistry."

This study optimally combines coincident active and passive microwave observations from CloudSat's Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) and the Advanced Scanning Microwave Radiometer (AMSR2) to resolve cloud and hydrometeor distribution parameters and to force consistency between the two independent sets of coincident observations. The result is an estimation of drizzle frequency and intensity that are consistent with both the CPR and AMSR2 observations for the high‐latitude oceans.

Hegerl,Decreasing aerosols increase the European summer diurnal temperature range,"Decreasing aerosols increase the European summer diurnal temperature range 
 The diurnal temperature range (DTR), the difference between daily maximum and minimum temperature, is important for the impact of extreme temperatures, but despite physical links to aerosol forcing previous studies have struggled to attribute observed DTR changes to aerosols. Using causal inference, we can clearly identify aerosols as a driver of European DTR change since 1940. Following a decrease from the 1940s, since the 1980s the European DTR has increased by about 0.5K due to a reduction in European aerosol emissions leading to cooler nights relative to days. Agreement between causal effects estimated from observations with those estimated for two CMIP6 models evaluates the models’ microphysical and radiative parameterizations. From causal effects, we also derive effective radiative forcing estimates of aerosols on surface shortwave during European summer, which amount to [−1.7; −1.5] Wm−2 in observations and one model, while it is less negative in the other model ([−0.9; −0.8] Wm−2)."

 The aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and fine-mode fraction (FMF) are crucial to understanding the radiative and environmental effects of aerosols. However, accurately retrieving these properties simultaneously from monodirectional multispectral satellite data remains challenging. Inversion algorithms based on lookup tables typically leverage information from only two or three channels, resulting in limited retrieval parameters. Although optimal estimation methods can enhance the utilization of multispectral information, they are mostly constrained by fixed aerosol types and have higher computational overhead due to the multiple iterations. To achieve real-time, high-precision, and simultaneous retrieval of the AOT and FMF for geostationary satellites with high-frequency observation, we propose a novel hybrid algorithm, AIRTrans, for the Himawari-8/AHI by integrating radiative transfer (RT) and transfer learning (TL) approaches. Specifically, RT is used to construct a simulation dataset that covers multiple aerosol types and surface conditions corresponding to the simulated multispectral observation, which pre-trains an artificial neural network model. The TL strategy is then employed to fine-tune this model using in situ data, enhancing its representativeness in real scenarios. AIRTrans performs direct retrieval using satellite observations and surface reflectance constructed via the second minimum reflectance method but considering background AOT. Results indicate that the AIRTrans-retrieved AOT and FMF are generally more consistent with ground-based observations from AERONET than official AHI products, through three years of independent validation across the full-disk region. Specifically, AIRTrans achieves retrieval with RMSEs of 0.132 and 0.146 for AOT and FMF, respectively, compared to 0.216 and 0.284 for AHI products. AIRTrans shows a remarkable improvement on FMF, particularly in addressing the significant underestimation of the AHI products at over 90 % of individual sites. The performance of AIRTrans during two severe aerosol pollution events (intense dust storms and haze) further demonstrates its robust ability to capture spatiotemporal variations of AOT and FMF simultaneously."

 Global climate models (GCMs) have significantly advanced in simulating mean cloud properties, yet challenges persist in accurately capturing cloud diurnal variations (CDVs), especially over land. This study explores the underlying causes of CDV biases by leveraging the Taiwan Earth System Model version 1 (TaiESM1), satellite observations, and reanalysis data. An assessment of CMIP6 models, including TaiESM1, indicates that these models perform well in simulating high and middle clouds over land and ocean. However, low clouds exhibit the weakest correlation, highlighting ongoing difficulties in their representation. Our analysis shows that TaiESM1 underestimates the diurnal amplitude of cloud fraction over land and predicts peak cloud coverage earlier than observed. While the simulated convective cloud fractions from shallow and deep convection schemes align well with observations, the stratiform cloud fractions produced by macrophysical schemes show a phase misalignment with observed CDVs. Moreover, the diurnal variations of stratiform clouds and their associated moisture tendencies deviate notably from observations, revealing limitations in the current parameterizations for stratiform clouds.We recommend enhancing the macrophysical and microphysical parameterization schemes to address these biases. Specifically, integrating stratiform cloud macrophysics, microphysics, and turbulent boundary layer processes within GCMs, such as incorporating the Cloud Layers Unified By Binormals framework, might improve the simulation of diurnal variations in cloud fraction over land. Moreover, shifting from bulk moisture budget approaches to models emphasizing variations in convective detrainment and subgrid vertical velocities associated with turbulent mixing will enhance the realism of stratiform cloud simulations. Implementing these adjustments is anticipated to improve the accuracy of CDV simulations in TaiESM1 and other GCMs, leading to better climate simulations."

We use an observationally constrained box model to show that cloud loss is the dominant sink of HPMTF in this region over 6 weeks, resulting in large reductions in DMS-derived products that contribute to aerosol formation and growth. Our findings indicate that fast cloud processing of HPMTF must be included in global models to accurately capture the sulfur cycle. 
 Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is the major sulfur species emitted from the ocean. The gas-phase oxidation of DMS by hydroxyl radicals proceeds through the stable, soluble intermediate hydroperoxymethyl thioformate (HPMTF), eventually forming carbonyl sulfide (OCS) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Recent work has shown that HPMTF is efficiently lost to marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds, thus arresting OCS and SO2 production and their contributions to new-particle formation and growth events. To date, no long-term field studies exist to assess the extent to which frequent cloud processing impacts the fate of HPMTF. Here, we present 6 weeks of measurements of the cloud fraction and the marine sulfur species methanethiol, DMS, and HPMTF made at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) research facility on Graciosa Island, Azores, Portugal. Using an observationally constrained chemical box model, we determine that cloud loss is the dominant sink of HPMTF in this region of the MBL during the study, accounting for 79 %–91 % of HPMTF loss on average. When accounting for HPMTF uptake to clouds, we calculate campaign average reductions in DMS-derived MBL SO2 and OCS of 52 %–60 % and 80 %–92 % for the study period. Using yearly measurements of the site- and satellite-measured 3D cloud fraction and DMS climatology, we infer that HPMTF cloud loss is the dominant sink of HPMTF in the eastern North Atlantic during all seasons and occurs on timescales faster than what is prescribed in global chemical transport models. Accurately resolving this rapid loss of HPMTF to clouds has important implications for constraining drivers of MBL new-particle formation."

This reveals the robustness of emissions estimated by this air-pollution-satellite-based CO2 emission inversion system, with relative change between tests and base inversion below 4.0 % for national annual NOx and CO2 emissions. 
 Simultaneous monitoring of greenhouse gases and air pollutant emissions is crucial for combating global warming and air pollution. We previously established an air-pollution-satellite-based carbon dioxide (CO2) emission inversion system, successfully capturing CO2 and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission fluctuations amid socioeconomic changes. However, the system's robustness and weaknesses have not yet been fully evaluated. Here, we conduct a comprehensive sensitivity analysis with 31 tests on various factors including prior emissions, model resolution, satellite constraint, and inversion system configuration to assess the vulnerability of emission estimates across temporal, sectoral, and spatial dimensions. The relative change (RC) between these tests and base inversion reflects the different configurations' impact on inferred emissions, with 1 standard deviation (1σ) of RC indicating consistency. Although estimates show increased sensitivity to tested factors at finer scales, the system demonstrates notable robustness, especially for annual national total NOx and CO2 emissions across most tests (RC < 4.0 %). Spatiotemporally diverse changes in parameters tend to yield inconsistent impacts (1σ ≥ 4 %) on estimates and vice versa (1σ < 4 %). The model resolution, satellite constraint, and NOx emission factors emerge as the major influential factors, underscoring their priority for further optimization. Taking daily national total CO2 emissions as an example, the RC‾ ± 1σ they incur can reach −1.2 ± 6.0 %, 1.3 ± 3.9 %, and 10.7 ± 0.7 %, respectively. This study reveals the robustness and areas for improvement in our air-pollution-satellite-based CO2 emission inversion system, offering opportunities to enhance the reliability of CO2 emission monitoring in the future."

Shittu;Kirsty J. Pringle;Stephen R. Arnold;Richard J. Pope;Ailish M. Graham;Carly Reddington;Richard Rigby;James B. McQuaid,Performance evaluation of Atmotube PRO sensors for air quality measurements in an urban location,"The study highlighted the performance of Atmotube PRO sensor particulate matter (PM) data. The result showed inter-sensor variability among the Atmotube PRO sensor data. This study showed 62.5 % of the sensors used for the study exhibited greater precision in their PM2.5 measurements. The overall performance showed that sensors passed the base testing using 1 h averaged data and that a multiple linear regression model using relative humidity values improved the performance of the PM2.5 data. 
 This study presents a performance evaluation of eight Atmotube PRO sensors using US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) guidelines. The Atmotube PRO sensors were collocated side by side with a reference-grade Fidas monitor in an outdoor setting for a 14-week period in the city centre of Leeds, UK. We assessed the linearity and bias for PM1, PM2.5, and PM10. The result of the PM2.5 assessment showed the Atmotube PRO sensors had particularly good precision with a coefficient of variation (CoV) of 28 %, 18 %, and 15 % for PM2.5 data averaged every minute, hour, and day, respectively. The inter-sensor variability assessment showed two sensors with low bias and one sensor with a higher bias in comparison with the sensor average. Simple univariate analysis was sufficient to obtain good fitting quality to a Fidas reference-grade monitor (R2>0.7) at hourly averages, although poorer performance was observed using a higher time resolution of 15 min averaged PM2.5 data (R2 of 0.48–0.53). The average error bias, root mean square error (RMSE), and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) were 3.38 µg m−3 and 0.03 %, respectively. While there were negligible influences of temperature on Atmotube PRO-measured PM2.5 values, substantial positive biases (compared to a reference instrument) occurred at relative humidity (RH) values > 80 %. The Atmotube PRO sensors correlated well with the PurpleAir sensor (R2 of 0.88, RMSE of 2.9 µg m−3). In general, the Atmotube PRO sensors performed well and passed the base-testing metrics as stipulated by recommended guidelines for low-cost PM2.5 sensors. Calibration using the multiple linear regression model was enough to improve the performance of the PM2.5 data of the Atmotube PRO sensors."

Nagao;Kentaroh Suzuki;Makoto Kuji,Retrieving cloud-base height and geometric thickness using the oxygen A-band channel of GCOM-C/SGLI,"In satellite remote sensing, estimating cloud-base height (CBH) is more challenging than estimating cloud-top height because the cloud base is obscured by the cloud itself. We developed an algorithm using the specific channel (known as the oxygen A-band channel) of the SGLI on JAXA’s GCOM-C satellite to estimate CBHs together with other cloud properties. This algorithm can provide global distributions of CBH across various cloud types, including liquid, ice, and mixed-phase clouds. 
 Measurements with a 763 nm channel, located within the oxygen A-band and equipped on the Second-generation Global Imager  (SGLI) on board the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Global Change Observation Mission – Climate (GCOM-C) satellite, have the potential to retrieve cloud-base height (CBH) and cloud geometric thickness (CGT) through passive remote sensing. This study implemented an algorithm to retrieve the CBH using the SGLI 763 nm channel in combination with several other SGLI channels in the visible, shortwave infrared, and thermal infrared regions. In addition to CBH, the algorithm can simultaneously retrieve other key cloud properties, including cloud optical thickness (COT), cloud effective radius, ice COT fraction as the cloud thermodynamic phase, cloud-top height (CTH), and CGT. Moreover, the algorithm can be seamlessly applied to global clouds comprised of liquid, ice, and mixed phases. The SGLI-retrieved CBH exhibited quantitative consistency with CBH data obtained from the ground-based ceilometer network, shipborne ceilometer, satellite-borne radar, and lidar observations, as evidenced by sufficiently high correlations and small biases. These results provide practical evidence that the retrieval of CBH is indeed possible using the SGLI 763 nm channel. Moreover, the results lend credence to the future use of SGLI CBH data, including the estimation of the surface downward longwave radiative flux from clouds. Nevertheless, issues remain that must be addressed to enhance the value of SGLI-derived cloud retrieval products. These include the bias of SGLI CTH related to cirrus clouds and the bias of SGLI CBH caused by multi-layer clouds."

Schultz,Observational ozone data over the global oceans and polar regions: The TOAR-II Oceans data set version 2024,"The first comprehensive dataset of tropospheric ozone over oceans/polar regions is presented, including 77 ship/buoy and 48 aircraft campaign observations (1977–2022, 0–5000 m altitude), supplemented by ozonesonde and surface data. Air masses isolated from land for 72+ hours are systematically selected as essentially oceanic. Among the 11 global regions, they show daytime decreases of 10–16% in the tropics, while near-zero depletions are rare, unlike in the Arctic, implying different mechanisms. 
 Studying tropospheric ozone over the remote areas of the planet, such as the open oceans and the polar regions, is crucial to understand the role of ozone as a global climate forcer and regulator of atmospheric oxidative capacity. A focus on the pristine oceanic and polar regions complements the available land-based data sets and provides insights into key photochemical and depositional loss processes that control the concentrations, spatio-temporal variability of ozone, and the physico-chemical mechanisms driving these patterns. However, an assessment of the role of ozone over the oceanic and polar regions has been hampered by a lack of comprehensive observational data sets. Here, we present the first comprehensive collection of ozone data over the oceans and the polar regions. The overall data set consists of 77 ship cruises/buoy-based observations and 48 aircraft-based campaigns. The data set, consisting of more than 630,000 independent ozone measurement data points covering the period from 1977 to 2022 and an altitude range from the surface to 5000 m (with a focus on the lowest 2000 m), allows systematic analyses of the spatio-temporal distribution and long-term trends over the defined 11 ocean/polar regions. The data sets from ships, buoys, and aircrafts are complemented with an ozonesonde data set from 29 launch sites or field campaigns, and by 21 non-polar and 17 polar ground-based stations data sets. The data were filtered by using backward trajectories calculated with the HYSPLIT model from the individual observation points to extract essentially oceanic observations, defined as air masses that have travelled over oceans for 72 hours or more, which were further tested with the coincident Radon observations. The oceanic and polar data thus selected showed typically flat diurnal patterns at high latitudes and daytime decreases (11–16 %) at low latitudes, indicating the adequacy of the data collection and processing procedures, as well as the potential for further studies of processes with statistical robustness and coverage. The ship/buoy- and aircraft-based data sets presented here will supplement the land-based ones in the TOAR-II database to provide a fully global assessment of tropospheric ozone."

This study demonstrates a novel approach using positive matrix factorization (PMF) applied to multipollutant mobile monitoring data to assess source-specific air pollution exposures and to estimate associated emission factors. Data were collected from one-year mobile monitoring, with an average of 26 repeated measures of size-resolved particle number counts (PNC), PM2.5, BC, NO2, and CO2 at 309 sites in Seattle from 2019 to 2020. PMF was used to characterize underlying source-related factors. The sources associated with these six factors included emissions from aviation, diesel trucks, gasoline/hybrid vehicles, oil combustion, wood combustion, and accumulation mode aerosols. Fuel-based emission factors for three transportation-related sources were also estimated. This study reveals that PNC of ultrafine particles with size <18, 18–42, and 42–178 nm was dominated by features associated with aircraft, diesel trucks, and both oil and wood combustion. Gasoline and hybrid vehicles contributed the most to CO2 and NO2 concentrations.

The Fire/Hotspot Characterization algorithm processes GOES-16’s Advanced Baseline Imager data, providing insights into fire dynamics with an unparalleled temporal resolution of 10 min. This allows one to retrieve a more accurate temporal evolution of wildfire radiative power, and emission estimates, than previous efforts based on polar satellites. Results for 2020 show an average burn activity radiative power cycle duration of approximately 4.56 h, temperature ranges estimated for the flaming (829 K to 1188 K) and smoldering phases (433 K to 686 K), and an average active fire area size of 0.464 km2. Using the FEER (Fire Energetics and Emissions Research) emission inventory, emissions for CO2, CO, CH4, and TPM (Total Particulate Matter) during peak fire activity (days of the year 150–350) were estimated. Between 2020 and 2022, the yearly total emissions increased from 434.7 to 523.8 Tg for CO2, 27.91 to 33.63 Tg for CO, 1.744 to 2.102 Tg for CH4, and 2.33 to 2.81 Tg for TPM.

We evaluated the spatiotemporal trends in population exposure to co-occurring WFS and EHEs (WFS-EHEs) in British Columbia (BC). We calculated the frequency, intensity, and trends in WFS-EHEs in each census dissemination area (DA) in BC between 2010 and 2022. WFS-EHEs were identified using established exceedance thresholds and daily data on fine particulate matter, smoke plumes, and meteorological conditions. Trends were identified using the Mann–Kendall and Theil–Sen approaches. Census data was used to identify the characteristics of the most exposed communities. Over 13 years, there were 276,666 DA-level WFS-EHEs, impacting all BC residents and leading to a cumulative 170.8 million person-days of exposure. Although there was substantial year-to-year variability, the frequency and intensity of WFS-EHEs increased over time, with 60.8% of co-occurrences between 2018 and 2022. 42.5% of DAs (∼1.9 million people) experienced significant increases in exposure. The highest co-exposure burden occurred in rural communities with lower adaptive capacity. Our findings demonstrate the need for public health guidance on these increasingly frequent and intense compound hazards and can inform climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts in BC and elsewhere."

The fractal dimension (Df ${D}_{f}$) of BC aggregates, is a critical morphology factor determining BC's absorption properties. However, Df ${D}_{f}$ cannot be measured online, making it hard to study the BC morphology evolution during atmospheric aging processing. We propose a novel method to measure BC's Df ${D}_{f}$ by establishing the relationship between BC's mobility diameter (Dm ${D}_{m}$), Df ${D}_{f}$, and mass concentration (m0 ${m}_{0}$). This method enables to measure the Df ${D}_{f}$ of BC aggregates online by measuring their Dm ${D}_{m}$ and m0 ${m}_{0}$ concurrently with an accuracy of 0.15. Field measurements show that the ambient BC Df ${D}_{f}$ ranges between 2.14 and 2.41 at a suburban site in China. This approach provides an efficient means to measure Df ${D}_{f}$ online, making it possible to track the ambient BC morphology evolution and constrain the BC optical and radiative properties."

However, their climate impact extends beyond carbon. Fires also emit large amounts of reactive nitrogen, which plays a crucial role in the nitrogen and carbon cycles. Through top‐down inversion of satellite observations, we estimate that the extreme boreal fires in 2021 and 2023 emitted 2.6 Tg N yr−1 and 4.9 Tg N yr−1 of NH3, respectively, which are comparable to agricultural‐intensive regions, making boreal fires the second‐largest contributor to the global reactive nitrogen budget. Unlike tropical fires, which emit more NOx than NH3, boreal fires are characterized by high NH3 emissions. With global warming likely to increase wildfire frequency, the rising NH3 emissions from boreal fires could have significant implications for the nitrogen and carbon cycles in that nitrogen‐limited region, necessitating their consideration in future climate impact assessments."

These regions also exhibit substantial increases in the frequency of occurrence of deep convective clouds. The observations indicate that the deep convective cloud top temperature decreases at approximately 4 K per decade. Our analysis reveals that these changes have accelerated markedly in the recent decade, especially post‐2010.

In this study, a synergy observation experiment from sun photometer and Lidar was carried out to reveal aerosol optical properties and direct radiative effect (DARE) in Central China from the novel perspective of aerosol components. Our results showed that the annual mass concentration of black carbon (BC) was low (2.49 mg/m2), but having large heating effect with the DARE of 9.27 W/m2 at the top of atmosphere. The brown carbon was found highest in summer (0.52 mg/m2) and its annual DARE was 0.10 W/m2, close to the average of China.

This model utilizes radar data and upper‐air atmospheric variables, and has been pretrained on satellite data from non‐target regions. Quantitative statistical assessments demonstrate that both the integration of multi‐source data and the implementation of pre‐training strategies enhance the model's performance. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of predictor importance, revealing a trend where atmospheric variables become increasingly important as the forecast horizon increases.

Wang,Variability of Eastern North Atlantic Summertime Marine Boundary Layer Clouds and Aerosols Across Different Synoptic Regimes Identified With Multiple Conditions,"This study estimates the meteorological covariations of aerosol and marine boundary layer (MBL) cloud properties in the eastern North Atlantic (ENA) region, characterized by diverse synoptic conditions. Using a deep‐learning‐based clustering model with mid‐level and surface daily meteorological data, we identify seven distinct synoptic regimes during the summer from 2016 to 2021. Our analysis, incorporating reanalysis data and satellite retrievals, shows that surface aerosols and MBL clouds exhibit clear regime‐dependent characteristics, whereas lower tropospheric aerosols do not. This discrepancy likely arises from synoptic regimes determined by daily large‐scale conditions, which may overlook air mass histories that predominantly dictate lower tropospheric aerosol conditions. Focusing on three regimes dominated by northerly winds, we analyze the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM) ENA observations on Graciosa Island in the Azores. In the subtropical anticyclone regime, fewer cumulus clouds and more single‐layer stratocumulus clouds with light drizzle are observed, along with the highest cloud droplet number concentration (Nd), surface cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and surface aerosol levels. The post‐trough regime features more broken or multi‐layer stratocumulus clouds with slightly higher surface rain rate, and lower Nd and surface CCN levels. The weak trough regime is characterized by the deepest MBL clouds, primarily cumulus and broken stratocumulus clouds, with the strongest surface rain rate and the lowest Nd, surface CCN and surface aerosol levels, indicating strong wet scavenging. These findings highlight the importance of considering the covariation of cloud and aerosol properties driven by large‐scale regimes when assessing aerosol indirect effects using observations."

Williams;Stefan Wolff;Christopher Pöhlker,"Decoding the Relationship Between Cloud Electrification, Downdrafts, and Surface Ozone in the Amazon Basin","The relationship between the electric field of storms and surface ozone (O3) levels in the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO) region was investigated. Our findings reveal that surface ozone concentrations increase with the rise in the absolute electric field (|Ez|) of clouds. This phenomenon is linked to the amplification of downdraft magnitudes, which are similarly associated with the |Ez|. Detailed analysis also indicated that stronger downdrafts correlate with higher surface ozone levels. Consequently, the |Ez|‐downdrafts‐O3 interaction forms a coupled system, influenced by the strength of convective clouds. Notably, a more significant effect is observed when the |Ez| surpasses the threshold of lightning activity, leading to an increment of up to 5 ppbv in surface O3. This increment was shown to be independent of downdraft intensity or cloud height, relating solely to the impact of electrical activity. Based on the observational data, a novel parameterization was developed to predict surface ozone concentrations during storms, effectively incorporating the proportional impact of cloud electrification and downdrafts. This phenomenological model provides a robust tool for understanding and forecasting ozone dynamics in storm events in the Amazon rainforest, highlighting the intricate interplay between cloud electricity, downdrafts, and air chemistry in tropical convective storms."

An initial assessment of this is done by applying a principal oscillation pattern analysis to observations (SWOOSH for Ozone) and reanalysis data (ERA5). This analysis highlights features of the ozone and temperature variability including two peaks in amplitude at different heights in the QBO region as well as more subtle phase differences that cannot be explained by a simple QBO theory. We also quantify the sizes of the ozone and temperature advection terms and show that the contribution of background upwelling on variations in the ozone gradient is not negligible (≈25%) $(\approx 25\%)$. A radiative‐convective equilibrium and photochemical equilibrium model, with the imposed ERA5 QBO variation in upwelling and OSIRIS NOx $\mathrm{N}{\mathrm{O}}_{\mathrm{x}}$ variations, is used to further understand ozone and temperature changes. The results show that photochemistry and transport are important at all levels, and it is misleading to divide the QBO into separate regimes. Prominent aspects of the variability can be reproduced if ERA5 upwelling is reduced by ∼60% ${\sim} 60\%$ between 15 and 50hPa $50\,\mathrm{h}\mathrm{P}\mathrm{a}$ where ERA5 is likely overpredicting the strength of the secondary meridional circulation. Finally, we demonstrate that nonlocality in the vertical plays a major role in QBO dynamics.

Ground validation via district‐level surveys aligns with the findings of our study. Results show 51% of the total crop area was burned (14,700 km2 in Punjab; 8,300 km2 in Haryana), leading to substantial emissions of PM2.5 (54.28 Gg; 7.94 Gg), CH4 (25.63 Gg; 3.75 Gg), CO2 (1,100.3 Gg; 195.7 Gg), NH3 (0.83 Gg; 0.15 Gg), SO2 (0.68 Gg; 0.12 Gg), and CO (62.1 Gg; 11.04 Gg). Emissions in Punjab are about 6.5 times higher than in Haryana attributable to greater burnt area (∼14,700 km2), higher crop yield, and elevated residue‐to‐crop ratios. Compared to VIIRS, Sentinel‐2 data provides approximately 3.6 times higher emission estimates, reflecting improved burnt area detection. District‐level emission variations underscore the influence of diverse farming practices, weather, and residue management. An uncertainty analysis, derived from multiple emissions estimates and methodologies, highlights regional disparities: SO2 exhibits the highest uncertainty in both states with PM2.5 and CO, respectively, showing the least.

This paper introduces a fast and accurate spectral extension algorithm designed to expand CPF‐like spectral radiances beyond the CPF spectral range (0.35–2.3 μm) to align with the CERES SW spectral range for its filtered (0.2–5 μm) and unfiltered (0.2–15.0 μm) radiances, facilitating accurate CPF‐CERES intercalibration. The algorithm demonstrates excellent accuracy in generating the missing energy within the UV and IR segments of the CERES SW range. The standard deviation is 0.2% for the integrated unfiltered radiances and 0.05% for the integrated filtered radiances. The bias is only −0.01% for the unfiltered case and −0.003% for the filtered case. The methodology was validated using measured EMIT radiance data. We employed EMIT radiances within the wavelength range of 0.43–2.25 μm to generate radiances for both the shorter (0.381–0.43 μm) and longer wavelength range (2.25–2.493 μm). The standard deviation in the integrated broadband radiances is about 0.1%, and the bias is less than 0.004% for over 1.5 million EMIT samples. These statistics suggest that the spectral extension algorithm is robust and effective in substantially reducing the spectral difference‐induced uncertainty in the CPF‐CERES intercalibration."

In this work, we combine socioeconomic metrics with spatially interpolated fine particulate matter and ozone concentrations from fifty-nine low-cost sensors and nine reference monitors to investigate inequality in air pollution exposure among different population groups in Greater Boston. The results indicate that the disadvantaged groups are exposed to higher levels of air pollution. Air pollution is concentrated in the center of Boston, Cambridge, Chelsea, and Everett, corresponding to high population density and anthropogenic activities. We further assess the environmental equality by reconstructing the EJ map for Massachusetts using median household income, percentage of minority, and percentage of limited English speaking as indicators. The EJ blocks are clustered in large cities across Massachusetts. Many communities in Greater Boston are classified as EJ communities due to the high percentage of minorities. Chelsea and Everett face more severe EJ issues, with most of their communities exceeding multiple EJ indicators. Additionally, we introduce and demonstrate a new method for determining EJ communities by utilizing the multi-criterion framework to calculate the cumulative EJ score for every census block, integrating air quality with socioeconomic indicators, and each indicator can be viewed as a policy action. Chelsea, Everett, and Lynn consistently exhibit the highest EJ scores with no improvements over the years. The EJ score system provides the time evolution to assist authorities and the residents in tracking the progress in improving the EJ scores of their communities. The method indicates the strength of the efforts needed to maintain or improve the EJ scores for achieving better EJ in the communities, allowing authorities to take immediate actions to improve the environmental well-being of vulnerable communities."

However, there is a lack of effective methods for evaluating future emissions reduction efforts, especially at the farm scale. We developed a rapid analysis method to evaluate CH4 emissions from a large number of dairy cow farms in the Netherlands based on single-transect mobile van measurements of CH4 concentrations downwind of farms located between 80 and 750 m from the road. Methane emissions from 51 dairy cow farms were determined on four campaign days within a total of 7 measurement hours between November 2017 and November 2018 using an inverse Gaussian approach combined with two different wind datasets and their composite. We found a range of moderate to high correlation (R2: minimum 0.42, maximum 0.86) between the estimated CH4 emission rates for 11–16 farms on each measurement day and the number of animal units (AUs, 1 AU equals 500 kg of animal weight) across four individual days. The whole-farm CH4 emission factors (including both enteric fermentation and manure) for the four separate campaign days were estimated using the slope between the CH4 emission rates derived from the composite of two distinct wind datasets and the number of AUs. Daily emission factors for the four campaign days were estimated to be in the range of 0.18–0.50 kgCH4/d/AU. From the dataset, averaged over each of the four campaign days, we derived an estimate of the whole-farm CH4 emission factor, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.47 [0.13–0.81] kgCH4/d/AU. Our results demonstrate that CH4 emissions from a large number of dairy cow farms can be rapidly estimated, providing an independent way to evaluate country-specific emission factors and a potential way to monitor future emission reductions."

This is known as the Dole–Morita effect, and its millennial-scale variations are recorded in ice cores. However, small variations of δatm(18O) in the present day have never been detected so far. This paper presents the first observations of diurnal, seasonal, and secular variations in δatm(18O) and applies them to evaluate oxygen, carbon, and water cycles. 
 Variations in the δ(18O) of atmospheric O2, δatm(18O), are an indicator of biological and water processes associated with the Dole–Morita effect (DME). The DME and its variations have been observed in ice cores for paleoclimate studies; however, variations in present-day δatm(18O) have never been detected so far. Here, we present diurnal, seasonal, and interannual variations of δatm(18O) based on observations at a surface site in central Japan. The average diurnal δatm(18O) cycle reached a minimum during the daytime, and its amplitude was larger in summer than in winter. We found that use of δatm(18O) enabled separation of variations of atmospheric δ(O2/N2) into contributions from biological activities and fossil fuel combustion. The average seasonal δatm(18O) cycle reached at a minimum in summer, and the peak-to-peak amplitude was about 2 per meg (1 per meg is 0.001 ‰). A box model that incorporated biological and water processes reproduced the general characteristics of the observed diurnal and seasonal cycles. A slight but significant secular increase in δatm(18O) by (0.22 ± 0.14) per meg a−1 occurred during 2013–2022. Secular changes in δatm(18O) were also simulated by using the box model considering long-term changes in terrestrial gross primary production (GPP), photorespiration, and δ(18O) of leaf water (δLW(18O)). We calculated changes in δLW(18O) using a state-of-the-art, three-dimensional model, MIROC5-iso. The observed secular increase in δatm(18O) was reproduced by the box model that incorporated the isotopic effects associated with the DME from Bender et al.

Therefore, long-term observations of δatm(18O) and better understanding of the DME are indispensable for an application of δatm(18O) to constrain long-term changes in global GPP and photorespiration."

Results reveal Romania's oil and gas methane emissions were significantly under-reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2019. A large underestimation was also found in the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) v7.0 for the study domain in the same year. 
 Production of oil and gas in Romania, one of the largest producers in the European Union (EU), is associated with substantial emissions of methane to the atmosphere and may offer high emission mitigation potential to reach the climate objectives of the EU. However, comprehensive quantification of emissions in this area has been lacking. Here we report top-down emission rate estimates derived from aircraft-based in situ measurements that were carried out with two aircraft during the 2019 ROmanian Methane Emissions from Oil and gas (ROMEO) campaign, supported by simulations with atmospheric models. Estimates from mass balance flights at individual dense production clusters and around larger regions show large variations between the clusters, supporting the important role of individual super-emitters, and possibly show variable operation practices or maintenance states across the production basin. Estimated annual total emissions from the southern Romanian oil and gas (O&G) infrastructure are 227 ± 86 kt CH4 yr−1, consistent with previously published estimates from ground-based site-level measurements during the same period. The comparison of individual plumes between measurements and atmospheric model simulations was complicated by unfavorable low-wind conditions. Similar correlations between measured and simulated CH4 enhancements during large-scale raster flights and mass balance flights suggest that the emission factor determined from a limited number of production clusters is representative of the larger regions. We conclude that ground-based and aerial emission rate estimates derived from the ROMEO campaign agree well, and the aircraft observations support the previously suggested large under-reporting of CH4 emissions from the Romanian O&G industry in 2019 to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). We also observed large underestimation from O&G emissions in the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) v7.0 for our domain of study."

Here, a simplified global model is developed, taking advantage of advances in remote-sensing data and in situ observations. The model reproduces the large spatial and temporal patterns of emissions, albeit with limitations in the tropics due to data scarcity. This model, while simple, can provide valuable insights into sensitivity analyses. 
 Wetlands are major contributors to global methane emissions. However, their budget and temporal variability remain subject to large uncertainties. This study develops the Satellite-based Wetland CH4 model (SatWetCH4), which simulates global wetland methane emissions at 0.25° × 0.25° and monthly temporal resolution, relying mainly on remote-sensing products. In particular, a new approach is derived to assess the substrate availability, based on Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The model is calibrated using eddy covariance flux data from 58 sites, allowing for independence from other estimates. At the site level, the model effectively reproduces the magnitude and seasonality of the fluxes in the boreal and temperate regions but shows limitations in capturing the seasonality of tropical sites. Despite its simplicity, the model provides global simulations over decades and produces consistent spatial patterns and seasonal variations comparable to more complex land surface models (LSMs). Such an independent data-driven approach based on remote-sensing products is intended to allow for future studies of intra-annual variations in wetland methane emissions. In addition, our study highlights uncertainties and issues in wetland extent datasets and the need for new seamless satellite-based wetland extent products. In the future, there is potential to integrate this one-step model into atmospheric inversion frameworks, thereby allowing for the optimization of the model parameters using atmospheric methane concentrations as constraints and hopefully better estimates of wetland emissions."

H. Fung,Improved Crop-specific NOx Emissions from Croplands in Southeast Asia over 1980–2019,"Nitrogen oxides (NOx) play an important role in the formation of tropospheric ozone and fine particulate matter. Although regulatory policies in Southeast Asia have successfully limited combustion sources of NOx emissions, fertilized cropland NOx emissions have become increasingly prominent. However, the amount and geographic distribution of NOx emissions from fertilized croplands over Southeast Asia remain largely uncertain. Here, we use a bottom-up spatial model that combines temperature dependence and the Yienger and Levy (YL95) scheme to quantify the spatiotemporal changes in crop-specific fertilized cropland NOx emissions at five-arcminute resolution (about 10 km) from 1980 to 2019. The results show a 4-fold increase in NOx emissions from fertilized croplands in Southeast Asia from 12.9 Gg N yr–1 (R50, the difference between the 25% and 75% quantiles: 8.8–17.7 Gg N yr–1) in 1980 to 53.3 Gg N yr–1 (R50: 35.6–72.0 Gg N yr–1) in 2019. During 1980–2019, the annual NOx emissions of rice, maize and other crops showed increasing spatial trends (0.20, 0.21, and 0.63 Gg N yr–2, respectively), whereas those of wheat remained flat (−0.0006 Gg N yr–2). Our new estimate averages 19% lower than previous bottom-up and top-down estimates. The NOx emissions hotspots are mainly located in Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines for rice, maize and other crops and in Myanmar for wheat. Our crop-specific and spatially explicit NOx emissions inventories can contribute to identifying emissions and reduction hotspots and assessing future policy implications regarding mitigation options for improving air quality and food security in Southeast Asia. Future studies that comprehensively consider meteorological conditions, soil properties, management practices and small-scale land-use changes can potentially lower the uncertainty of this estimation."

This study used tropospheric NO2 data from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) and traffic-related land use parameters to estimate long-term average NO2 concentrations at a spatial resolution of 500 m in South Korea from 2018 to 2022. Our satellite-land use hybrid regression model showed reasonably high predictability with a cross-validation R2 of 0.81, mean absolute error of 2.28 ppb and root mean squared error of 2.85 ppb. Leveraging these high-resolution data, we assessed the representativeness of ground monitors for population exposure by comparing population-weighted NO2 concentrations from estimated and measured data. Across 17 metropolitan cities and provinces, the ratios of population-weighted estimated to measured NO2 ranged from 0.62 to 1.12, with the ratio of 1 exhibiting the most representative monitoring networks. We further investigated disproportionate NO2 exposures based on socioeconomic status, revealing that NO2 exposures were consistently higher in local districts with higher socioeconomic status because of the unique historical backgrounds of rapid economic development and urban infrastructure design in South Korea. Using high-resolution NO2 data can lead to more comprehensive and precise exposure assessments, enhancing public health and regulatory applications."

Technological advancements have made mobile air toxic monitoring a useful and attractive approach to spatially quantify VOC concentrations in real-time, but there is a need to evaluate the accuracy of these measurements in real-world applications using intercomparison techniques. Here, we conducted a two-week field campaign near different VOC-emitting facilities using three different mobile monitoring platforms and four different ambient VOC-measurement technologies. Our primary focus was the intercomparison of a proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS) and canister samples analyzed by an offline gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GC-MS), but we also collected measurements using a closed-path ultraviolet differential optical absorption spectrometer (UV-DOAS) and a selected ion flow tube mass spectrometer (SIFT-MS). The PTR-ToF-MS and offline GC-MS analyses show strong agreement in stationary settings (all targeted VOCs R2 = 0.92, slope = 1.1) for aromatic compounds including benzene (R2 = 0.95, p < 0.001), naphthalene (R2 = 0.84, p < 0.01), and xylenes + ethylbenzene (R2 = 0.93, p < 0.01). PTR-ToF-MS and UV-DOAS comparisons have varied results. The UV-DOAS compared well at some monitoring locations but had poor agreement in ambient air matrices containing naphthalene, which caused uncorrectable interferences for measurements of benzene, toluene, and xylenes. Lastly, the PTR-ToF-MS and SIFT-MS showed strong agreement (all targeted VOCs R2 = 0.68, slope = 0.85) in mobile format comparisons but only when aldehyde compounds with high background noise were removed. Our results highlight some potential interferences that should be accounted for when performing monitoring of mobile air toxics and demonstrate multi-instrument comparison techniques that can be used to ensure robust data collection."

We find fossil fuel combustion is a major contribution (73% ± 5%), yet the biomass burning fraction (ƒbiomass) has grown from 24% ± 4% to 30% ± 4% since 1990. Intriguingly, we further find the ƒbiomass demonstrating a robust correlation with South Asian wildfires linked to climate oscillations. Thus, for mitigating BC impacts on Himalayan glaciers, South Asia's transition from fossil fuels to clean energy is a more efficient and urgent strategy than reducing residential biomass burning."

To discern these relationships in a high‐altitude mountainous terrain is even less well‐studied. Therefore, we deployed a Wideband Integrated Bioaerosol Sensor (WIBS‐Neo) for three months during the first biologically active season of the Surface Atmosphere Integrated Field Laboratory (SAIL) campaign in summer 2022 on Mt. Crested Butte in Colorado (elevation ∼ ${\sim} $3,140 m ASL). Here, we report real‐time fluorescent BAP (FBAP) data collected from 15 June to 13 September 2022, sampled from within the ARM Aerosol Observing System (AOS). To our knowledge, these are the first high altitude (>3,000 m ASL) continuous measurements of FBAP made in North America. During this deployment, we observed on average 21% and as many as 48% (hourly maximum) of particles within the detection size range (0.5μm $0.5{\upmu }\mathrm{m}$ to 30μm $30{\upmu }\mathrm{m}$) of the WIBS as FBAP. Our analysis presents the diurnal cycles for seven distinct types of FBAP, showing unique patterns and, in some cases, correlations with temperature and solar radiation cycles. Abundance and composition of FBAP varied with relative humidity and precipitation. Precipitation events appeared to both cause emission and removal of FBAP, whereas dust and smoke events had no significant effect, highlighting the critical role of meteorology on FBAP at high altitudes."

 The knowledge of chemical composition of atmospheric aerosols is key to understand aerosol-cloud-climate interactions and surface water biogeochemistry in the oceanic regions. Despite of strong natural and anthropogenic sources in its upwind regions, the studies on aerosol composition have been very limited over the Arabian Sea. We have comprehensively analyzed the results from global models, ECMWF's CAMS and NASA's MERRA-2 reanalyses, in conjunction with our ship-based measurements. Both models captured the overall spatio-temporal variability in sulphate (SO42−) and sea salt (r = 0.76–0.86). However, there is large scatter in PM10 and dust variability and the concentrations are typically overestimated by MERRA-2 except during winter, but underestimated by CAMS. Despite of difference in magnitudes, these models successfully reproduced the key seasonal features e.g., winter-time maxima in sulphate (9.0 ± 6.5 μg m−3 in MERRA-2, 11.9 ± 6.2 μg m−3 in measurements). While sulphate enhancement is most pronounced along India's west coast, the monsoon-time sea salt spike is strongest near east coast of the Middle-East (>200 μg m−3) region. Trend analysis results from both models indicate a statistically significant increase in sulphate aerosols over the Arabian Sea during 2003–2022 period (0.4 μgm−3y−1 in winter). However, long-term trends in sea salt and dust are not consistent between the two models and underscore a need for further investigations. Insights into aerosol distribution and model performances from this study would aid in planning future expeditions and refining chemistry-climate models, thereby enhancing our understanding of biogeochemical processes in the Indian Ocean."

 African dust (AD) plays a key role in atmospheric and biogeochemical processes across various ecosystems, yet its impact in Mexico, particularly in the Yucatan Peninsula (YP), remains understudied. This study chemically characterized AD transported to the YP during the massive “Godzilla” event in June 2020 and subsequent intrusions in 2021. The objective was to describe the chemical composition of dust, trace its origins, and assess its influence on atmospheric particles at three sites: Cozumel, Mérida, and Sisal. Aerosol samples were collected using PM10 and PM2.5 samplers and analyzed via Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence, and ion chromatography. Satellite imagery and air mass trajectories were used to identify periods with AD transport. Descriptive statistics and hierarchical clustering were used to identify intrusion periods and group samples based on their chemical compositions. Our results showed that PM10 concentrations during AD events increased up to 20 times compared to baseline levels. Among the analyzed elements, Al, Fe, Ca, and Si were the most abundant. Enrichment of ionic species like SO42− and NO3− was attributed to marine sources and local emissions. Correlation analysis and rare earth element clustering confirmed the African origin of the dust, primarily from Morocco and northern Algeria and Mali (Sahara region), with evidence of particle dilution as the dust traveled across the YP. These findings emphasize the significant role of AD intrusions in altering the aerosol chemical composition in the YP, contributing to a better understanding of dust and element transport mechanisms and their atmospheric and biogeochemical impacts in the region."

 Accurate identification of aerosol types is essential for understanding the radiative properties of aerosols and further studying aerosol regional and global climate effects. However, aerosol type identification studies combining satellite and ground observations are rare. In this paper, an aerosol type identification model based on aerosol relative optical depth (AROD) and volume depolarization ratio (VDR) is developed by effectively matching satellite and ground observation data. The accuracy and applicability of the new model are verified by typical AERONET sites with dominant aerosols, and the spatial distribution characteristics of aerosol types in global continents are also studied and analyzed with joint observation data from 2018 to 2023 globally. The results show that the East Asian continent, North America, and Europe are the main source regions for continental aerosol emissions. Among the continents, densely populated East/Southeast Asia is more heavily polluted by anthropogenic aerosols than other continents, while North America and Europe are relatively less polluted. The Indo-China Peninsula, central and southern Africa, central South America, and central and northern North America are the main source emission regions of global biomass burning aerosol, while northern Africa, West Asia, and Central Asia emit most of the global dust and polluted dust aerosols.

 We examined the responses of the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) onboard the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-16 (GOES-16) to 174 negative cloud-to-ground (CG) return strokes in 77 flashes that occurred in Florida in 2018–2023. We recorded these strokes on high-speed video cameras from which we measured the continuing current durations. The GLM flash and stroke detection efficiencies were 80.5 and 50 %, respectively. The nighttime stroke detection efficiency was 2.4 times higher than that during the daytime (81.3 versus 33.9 %, receptively). The detection efficiencies for first strokes and single-stroke flashes were 31.3 and 30 %, respectively, which were lower than that for subsequent strokes (61.7 %). The GLM stroke detection efficiency did not depend upon the return stroke peak current reported by the U.S. National Lightning Detection Network, but it was significantly higher (64.9 versus 37.5 %) for strokes with significant (>3 ms) continuing current durations versus those without (<3 ms) such currents. Continuing current durations estimated from the GLM data were significantly underestimated and were unrelated to those measured from video camera records; none of the GLM-derived continuing current durations exceeded 6 ms, while those obtained from video camera records ranged from 0.28 to 685 ms. GLM Level 0 versus Level 2 data comparison indicates that onboard and ground processing techniques applied for noise removal may be responsible for continuing current duration underestimation and reduced first-stroke detection efficiency, respectively."

Realizing this requires careful consideration of other geophysical signals such as the signal delay induced by water vapor in the troposphere. Over short spatial scales (<∼80 km), this signal is not well‐captured by radiometer observations. Here we investigate the wet troposphere in Australian coastal regions during SWOT's 3‐month calibration phase. Using a high‐resolution atmospheric model and a novel in situ array of GNSS observations, we find the SWOT error budget for wet troposphere is regularly exceeded, with signal magnitudes up to double the error budget at small scales. We also find centimeter level biases in radiometer derived delays within ∼50 km of the coast. We suggest that, given the low radar noise and high resolution of SWOT KaRIn observations, wet troposphere errors can bias geophysical interpretation and hence have increased significance for ocean topography."

 Severe East Asian dust storms occur in spring due to dust-emitting winds in the Gobi Desert associated with Mongolian cyclones. The present study performs the first quantitative assessment of the contributions of Mongolian cyclones to springtime dust activity in East Asia, based on multiple reanalyses and observational datasets for 2001–2022. Atmospheric depressions dominate dust activities in Northern China, explaining ~90–92% of the total dust emissions in the Gobi Desert and ~88–93% of the dust aerosol optical depth (τ) downwind, depending on the dataset. Mongolian cyclones, defined as long-living and mobile atmospheric depressions, explain almost half (~34–47%) of the Gobi’s total dust emissions and τ downwind, and are the primary driver of high-impact dust storms. The number of Mongolian cyclones, along with the dust activity, has decreased since 2001, with a spatial pattern of the dust emission trend that is consistent with the northward shift of cyclone tracks."

 Total Suspended Particles (TSP) is an important indicator of air quality, yet traditional prediction models lack comprehensive consideration of spatio-temporal interactions of different meteorological and air pollution phenomena. To address these limitations, this study introduces an explainable (X) deep hybrid (H) network, integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BGRU), for hourly TSP concentration prediction. The model was trained and evaluated using meteorological and air quality data from Canon Hill, Australia. By combining CNN’s spatial feature extraction capabilities with BGRU’s temporal dependencies, the model effectively captures complex spatial–temporal patterns in the data. The X-H-CBGRU model outperforms fifteen competing benchmark models such as deep neural network, extreme learning machine, multilayer perceptron, support vector regression, random forest regression, light gradient boosting, gradient boosting regression, long short-term memory network, as well as their hybrid CNN counterparts in terms of the accuracy evidenced by a lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE ≈6.302μg/m3) and higher Correlation Coefficient (r ≈0.91) compared to other models. Moreover, the model demonstrates strong probabilistic performance with a high Prediction Interval Coverage Probability (PICP ≈0.98) and low Prediction Interval Normalized Average Width (PINAW ≈0.18), indicating its reliable prediction intervals. To enhance model interpretability, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) methods were employed, revealing PM10 concentration, relative humidity, air temperature, and wind speed as key predictors of TSP concentrations. The Diebold–Mariano statistical test further confirmed the model’s superior performance. This study contributes towards advancing TSP prediction by providing a robust, accurate, and interpretable model which has particular importance in locations such as mining regions. The X-H-CBGRU model holds potential for improving public health protection and informing air pollution mitigation strategies."

 Sand and Dust Storm (SDS) is an important disastrous weather, and spring 2023 marked the highest frequency of SDSs in the past decade in East Asia. Combining model prediction and multi-source observations, based on the generally good ability of the CMA_Meso/CUACE_SDS model to reproduce the dust emission, transportation paths, development stages, PM10 concentration, and dust vertical distribution, five typical SDS events were selected to study the relative contributions of the major three deserts: Mongolia, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang deserts to the desert sources, near and far downwind areas including Mongolia, China, Korean Peninsula, and Japan.From the perspective of the total accumulated dust emission of the five SDSs in the three primary desert source regions, the Xinjiang desert had the highest emissions of 153.6 Tg, followed by the Mongolian deserts of 81.3 Tg, and the lowest emissions in the Inner Mongolian deserts of 41.4 Tg. However, the contributions of the three deserts to the surface dust concentration were not entirely consistent with their accumulated dust emissions. The sensitive experiments showed Mongolia desert contributes 40.5 %, 34.6 %, 47.0 %, 49.5 %, and 48.4 % of the surface dust concentration in Inner Mongolia deserts, Central China, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei in China, Northeast China, and Yangtze River Delta regions, indicating the first contribution to its near downwind regions in China by cross-boundary transportation; Xinjiang desert is second contributor, with corresponding contribution of 19.0 %, 27.7 %, 31.9 %, 35.3 %, and 42.6 % for the same regions; while the contribution of Inner Mongolia desert to the dust in downwind area was the smallest, contributing less than 25 % to most regions except for its neighboring Central China (37.7 %). The dust concentrations of far downwind regions of the Korean Peninsula and Japan were more influenced by the Xinjiang deserts, which contributed 47.0 % and 51.4 % to these two regions, Mongolia deserts contributed 35.1 % and 34.4 %.

Number concentrations and sizes of emitted particles are critical for assessing the climate and health impacts of shipping emissions. Here, we build the direct ship particle number (SPN) emission inventory and further propose a computationally efficient approach (look‐up table, EIPN) to estimate particle number emission by accounting for the subgrid process of ship plumes. In the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) coastal area along East China Sea, the total ship particle number emission estimated based on EIPN is 7.3 × 1023 particles with the values of 5.9 × 1024 particles predicted by the SPN, showing a notable overestimation by a factor of ∼8 (compared to EIPN). The particle number and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) under 0.4% water supersaturation (CCN0.4) conducted utilizing the EIPN with normalized mean biases (NMB) of −13.1% and −28.6% exhibit higher concordance with observations than those using the conventional mass emission inventory (NMB = −37.7%, −44.9%) and SPN (NMB = −57.4%, −72.2%), demonstrating the significant improvement in 3‐D models. Ship‐related particles have large spatiotemporal variations, and their contribution to CCN is driven by secondary particles.

Common surface measurements may misleadingly imply this process due to low nighttime ozone at surface level in winter. However, our study reveals a more complex picture by unveiling the vertical dynamics of nitrate formation through an integration of tethered airship campaign, long‐term ground measurements, and model simulations. Interestingly, we observed rapid nitrate growth at approximately 400 m altitude, where the box model revealed optimal conditions for sustained nocturnal nitrate production. The nitrate accumulated overnight in the residual layer (RL) is transported downward in the next morning as the nocturnal boundary layer breaks down, substantially increasing surface‐level nitrate and thus exacerbating pollution. Annual‐averaged diurnal patterns of nitrate measured at the ground station clearly confirm this morning increase. The vertical mixing from the RL contributes up to 80% of the total surface nitrate at 10:00 LT with its influence persisting at 31% even after sunset. Air mass trajectory analysis further confirms that emissions from city‐cluster significantly contribute to downwind pollution by transporting pollutants into the RL. This research underscores the important role of RL chemical processes, facilitated by elevated ozone, in shaping surface‐level pollution. It highlights the indispensability of vertical profiling in understanding aerosol pollution and advocates for regionally coordinated control strategies across eastern China."

Low level mixed‐phase clouds strongly control the surface radiation budget of this region but remain challenging for climate models because of the complex processes controlling the sources and sinks of cloud liquid water, including both cloud liquid water and ice crystals. Here, we examine these interactions using the Unified Model (UM) regional climate model, with the Cloud AeroSol Interacting Microphysics (CASIM) and UK Chemistry and Aerosol (UKCA) models included for interactive aerosol and cloud microphysics. We simulate two case studies from the second field campaign of Clouds Aerosols Precipitation Radiation and atmospheric Composition over the Southern Ocean Phase 2 (CAPRICORN‐2), which represent the open ocean and the offshore coastal region of Antarctica. Compared with these observations, we find that the UM underestimates surface aerosol concentration by up to an order of magnitude and investigate the effect of this bias on the simulated cloud microphysical and radiative properties. We find that the cloud liquid water path (LWP) and surface radiative fluxes are also biased in the offshore coastal Antarctic case study, with a 32% mean underestimation of LWP and 76% mean overestimation of downwelling surface shortwave flux. Sensitivity tests show that the cloud liquid water bias is largely caused by deficiencies in the representation of the meteorology, and less by aerosol or cloud microphysical properties.

 Ambient nitrous acid (HONO) plays a crucial role in the atmosphere's oxidative capacity, significantly impacting air quality and climate. This study reviews the current understanding of HONO formation mechanisms, including in-situ and vertical gradient measurements, as well as the temporal, spatial, and vertical characteristics of HONO and its modeling approaches. HONO concentrations exhibit significant diurnal variation based on sources and sinks in different environments. Typically, concentrations are higher near the ground and decrease with altitude. Additionally, this study examines the incorporation of contemporary HONO chemical mechanisms into box models, regional and global chemical transport models (CTMs), and chemistry-climate models. Models often underestimate observations due to uncertainties in heterogeneous HONO formation and varying measurement techniques. Finally, this review identifies key challenges for future HONO measurements and modeling efforts. Significant opportunities remain to enhance our fundamental understanding of HONO. Precision and accuracy are important for advancing HONO observation measurement techniques. Simultaneously, the representation of HONO in state-of-the-art models helps us better quantify atmospheric oxidation capacity and air quality impacts."

 Sulfate (SO42−) is an essential constituent of aerosols that play an important role in regulating global climate. Over the past decades, polar sea-ice cover changed significantly, potentially influencing the atmospheric budget of SO42−. However, limited research has been conducted to quantify the effects of sea ice on atmospheric SO42− over different times and regions. Here, we report the SO42−/Na+ mass ratios of aerosols and precipitation samples collected in coastal East Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula during 2016–2022. The SO42−/Na+ mass ratios at both sites show similar seasonal trends; aerosols display higher ratios than precipitation in summer, with no significant difference in winter, possibly due to precipitation preferentially removing coarse-mode aerosols. The percentage of air mass travelling time over sea ice (P-Time) is positively correlated with SO42−/Na+ mass ratio (or nss-SO42− concentrations) in summer, suggesting the enhanced atmospheric SO42− production over sea ice due to higher dimethyl sulfide (DMS) emissions and/or enhanced oxidation chemistry of DMS. But this relationship becomes negative during winter, suggesting the predominant influence of sea salt aerosols (SSA) from the sea ice surface on atmospheric SO42− levels. In winter, the SO42−/Na+ mass ratio appears to be relatively invariable when the P-Time exceeds ∼40–60 %, ranging from ∼0.08 to 0.18. The lower limit of the mass ratio, ∼0.08, likely representing the influence of sea ice SSA on the mass ratio. Based on this value, it is estimated that approximately half of the atmospheric SO42− in winter originates from sea ice SSA. These findings highlight the importance of sea ice on aerosol budgets and atmospheric chemistry in polar regions."

Cachorro;Bernhard Mayer;Ángel M. de Frutos,Impact of cloud presence on sky radiances and the retrieval of aerosol properties,"•Cloud presence increases sky radiance in cloud-free points of the sky. •This increase in sky radiance can affect the performance of cloud-screening algorithms. •The enhancement of sky radiances due to cloud presence affects the retrieval of aerosol properties when these measurements are used as input. •In partially cloudy skies the aerosol single scattering albedo is overestimated when sky radiance measurements are used for the retrieval. 
 This paper explores the influence of the presence of clouds on sky radiances. It also analyses their impact on the retrieval of aerosol properties when using an inversion algorithm whose radiative transfer model (RTM) is designed for cloud-free atmospheres. For that, synthetic observations are simulated for 9 partially cloudy skies and for their equivalent cloud-free skies, considering 16 different aerosol scenarios. A parameter named cloud enhancement factor (CEF) has been used to determine the modifications induced in the sky radiances by each partially cloudy scenario with respect to the cloud-free sky. This parameter indicates that the sky radiances remaining after applying a cloud-screening are affected by the presence of clouds. In general, they show enhancements between 0 and 20 % with respect to the cloud-free radiances, depending on the cloudy conditions and the scattering angle. The synthetic observations used as input for the retrieval of aerosol properties are the ones required by the inversion strategy used, GRASPpac: the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and sky radiances at 4 different wavelengths together with the ceilometer range corrected signal (RCS). In partially cloudy scenarios with low CEFs, the aerosol properties do not present significant changes with respect to the cloud-free conditions. However, for partially cloudy scenarios with higher CEFs, a clear differentiation between the aerosol optical properties retrieved with and without clouds is observed. In these scenarios, the precision of the retrieval is similar for both conditions, but the accuracy is lower for the cloudy conditions. In particular, under partially cloudy conditions, it is observed an overestimation of the real refractive index (RRI) and the single scattering albedo (SSA) between 0.05 and 0.06 and between 0.03 and 0.06 respectively, and an underestimation of the asymmetry factor (g) and the imaginary refractive index (IRI) of about −0.02 and − 0.005, respectively. These values slightly vary with the aerosol load and wavelength for the RRI and SSA.

Sporre;Johan Friberg,Impact of SO2 injection profiles on simulated volcanic forcing for the 2009 Sarychev eruptions – investigating the importance of using high-vertical-resolution methods when compiling SO2 data,"We investigate the importance of using high-vertical-resolution (HR) SO2 data when simulating volcanic eruptions' impact on the stratospheric aerosol load and climate, using WACCM, and compare simulations with aerosol observations from CALIOP. Simulations with HR SO2 data match the observations well, whereas simulations with the model's default low-resolution (LR) data underestimate the aerosol load by ~ 50 %. The resulting climate cooling is twice as high for the HR than the LR SO2 data. 
 Aerosols from volcanic eruptions impact our climate by influencing the Earth's radiative balance. The degree of their climate impact is determined by the location and injection altitude of the volcanic SO2. To investigate the importance of utilizing correct injection altitudes, we ran climate simulations of the June 2009 Sarychev eruptions with three SO2 datasets in the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2), Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model Version 6 (WACCM6). We have compared simulations with WACCM6 default 1 km vertically resolved dataset M16 with our two 200 m vertically resolved datasets, S21-3D and S21-1D. S21-3D is distributed over a large area (30 latitudes and 120 longitudes), whereas S21-1D releases all SO2 in one latitude and longitude grid box, mimicking the default dataset M16.For S21-1D and S21-3D, 95 %  of the SO2 was injected into the stratosphere, whereas M16 injected only 75 % into the stratosphere. This difference is due to the different vertical distributions and resolutions of SO2 in the datasets. The larger portion of SO2 injected into the stratosphere for the S21 datasets leads to more than twice as high sulfate aerosol load in the stratosphere for the S21-3D simulation compared to the M16 simulation during more than 8 months. The temporal evolution in aerosol optical depth (AOD) from  our two simulations, S21-3D and S21-1D, follows the observations from the spaceborne lidar instrument CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) closely, while the AOD in the M16 simulation is substantially lower. This indicates that the injection altitude and vertical resolution of the injected volcanic SO2 substantially impact the model's ability to correctly simulate the climate impact from volcanic eruptions.The S21-3D dataset with its high vertical and horizontal resolution resulted in global volcanic forcing of −0.24 W m−2 during the first year after the eruptions, compared with only −0.11 W m−2 for M16.  Hence, our study highlights the importance of the vertical distribution of SO2 injections in simulations of volcanic climate impact and calls for a re-evaluation of further volcanic eruptions."

Because of food demand, NH3 emissions are projected to rise by 2100. Using a global model, we analyzed the impact of present and future NH3 emissions generated from a land model. Our results show improved ammonia patterns compared to a reference inventory. Future scenarios predict up to 70 % increase in global NH3 burden, with significant changes in radiative forcing that can greatly elevate N2O. 
 Agricultural practices are a major source of ammonia (NH3) in the atmosphere, which has implications for air quality, climate, and ecosystems. Due to the rising demand for food and feed production, ammonia emissions are expected to increase significantly by 2100 and would therefore impact atmospheric composition such as nitrate (NO3-) or sulfate (SO42-) particles and affect biodiversity from enhanced deposition. Chemistry–climate models which integrate the key atmospheric physicochemical processes with the ammonia cycle represent a useful tool to investigate present-day and also future reduced nitrogen pathways and their impact on the global scale. Ammonia sources are, however, challenging to quantify because of their dependencies on environmental variables and agricultural practices and represent a crucial input for chemistry–climate models. In this study, we use the chemistry–climate model LMDZ–INCA (Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique–INteraction with Chemistry and Aerosols) with agricultural and natural soil ammonia emissions from a global land surface model ORCHIDEE (ORganising Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic Ecosystems), together with the integrated module CAMEO (Calculation of AMmonia Emissions in ORCHIDEE), for the present-day and 2090–2100 period under two divergent Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP5-8.5 and SSP4-3.4). Future agricultural emissions under the most increased level (SSP4-3.4) have been further exploited to evaluate the impact of enhanced ammonia emissions combined with future contrasting aerosol precursor emissions (SSP1-2.6 –  low emissions; SSP3-7.0 – regionally contrasted emissions). We demonstrate that the CAMEO emission set enhances the spatial and temporal variability in the atmospheric ammonia in regions such as Africa, Latin America, and the US in comparison to the static reference inventory (Community Emissions Data System; CEDS) when assessed against satellite and surface network observations. The CAMEO simulation indicates higher ammonia emissions in Africa relative to other studies, which is corroborated by increased current levels of reduced nitrogen deposition (NHx), a finding that aligns with observations in west Africa. Future CAMEO emissions lead to an overall increase in the global NH3 burden ranging from 59 % to 235 %, while the NO3- burden increases by 57 %–114 %, depending on the scenario, even when global NOx emissions decrease. When considering the most divergent scenarios (SSP5-8.5 and SSP4-3.4) for agricultural ammonia emissions, the direct radiative forcing resulting from secondary inorganic aerosol changes ranges from −114 to −160 mW m−2. By combining a high level of NH3 emissions with decreased or contrasted future sulfate and nitrate emissions, the nitrate radiative effect can either overcompensate (net total sulfate and nitrate effect of −200 mW m−2) or be offset by the sulfate effect (net total sulfate and nitrate effect of +180mWm-2). We also show that future oxidation of NH3 could lead to an increase in N2O atmospheric sources from 0.43 to 2.10 Tg N2O yr−1 compared to the present-day levels, representing 18 % of the future N2O anthropogenic emissions. Our results suggest that accounting for nitrate aerosol precursor emission levels but also for the ammonia oxidation pathway in future studies is particularly important to understand how ammonia will affect climate, air quality, and nitrogen deposition."

Here, we reported high-resolution (2 h interval) measurements of NO2 isotopic compositions in a megacity in Central China. Δ17O(NO2) exhibited a clear diurnal cycle with elevated values during the day versus night. Daytime Δ17O(NO2) varying from 20.2 to 40.1‰ can be explained by variations in ozone (O3) versus peroxyl radical oxidation of nitric oxide (NO). The estimated peroxyl radicals were positively correlated with photochemical oxidants (Ox = O3 + NO2), revealing the ability of Δ17O(NO2) to reflect changes in the atmospheric oxidation environment. Nighttime Δ17O(NO2) variations (12.9 to 29.8‰) can be categorized into three regimes: the first regime when Δ17O(NO2) stabilized at approximately 20‰ can be well explained by Δ17O transfer from O3; the increases of Δ17O(NO2) above 20‰ were attributed to the vertical mixing of residual layer air with elevated Δ17O(NO2) and the exchange process between NO2 and dinitrogen pentoxide; and as low as 12.9‰ Δ17O(NO2) can be explained by primary NO2 emissions and the exchange process between NO and NO2. The NO–NO2 exchange also elevated δ15N(NO2), consistent with the observed negative relationships between Δ17O(NO2) and δ15N(NO2) at night."

Romanias,Real-World Asphalt Pavement Emissions: Combining Simulation Chamber Measurements and City Scale Modeling to Elucidate the Impacts on Air Quality,"In this paper, the role of asphalt pavement emissions in urban air quality was assessed combining laboratory experiments and city-scale air-quality modeling. In particular, the emission factors (EFs) of volatile and intermediate volatility organic compounds (VOCs and IVOCs) of asphalt pavements were determined in an atmospheric simulation chamber. Relative humidity (RH) and simulated solar light UV-A radiation were found to play a key role in the emission of VOCs and IVOCs. RH significantly increased  the EFs, and predominantly those of oxygenated VOCs, due to changes in the microphysical properties of the materials. Under UV-A radiation, EFs were enhanced, due to the photochemical process induced on the asphalt–air interface. IVOCs were found to account for up to 30% of the Total EFs measured. Considering Paris as a case study, asphalt emissions in air-quality simulations lead to an increase in organic aerosol concentrations of at least 3%, during average summer daytime conditions. We estimate this impact significantly higher, in case all the IVOCs emissions are included in the model. This highlights the significant influence of solar radiation on emissions from old asphalt when exposed to UV radiation and the impact on air quality during the summer."

 Reactive organic carbon species are important fuel for atmospheric chemical reactions, including the formation of secondary organic aerosol. However, in parallel to atmospheric oxidation processes, deposition can remove compounds from the atmosphere and impact downstream environments. To understand the impact of deposition on atmospheric oxidation, we present a framework for predicting and visualizing the fate of a molecule on the basis of the physicochemical properties of compounds (Henry’s law constant, vapour pressure and reaction rate constants), which are used to estimate timescales for oxidation and deposition. By implementing our deposition rates in chemical models, we show that deposition substantially suppresses atmospheric reactivity and aerosol formation by removing early-generation products and preventing the formation of large fractions (up to 90%) of downstream, late-generation compounds. Deposition is frequently missing in the laboratory experiments and detailed chemical modelling, which probably biases our understanding of atmospheric composition.

 During the month of September, biomass burning activities peak in the southern part of Southeast Asia or the Maritime Continent. The emission and longevity of aerosols in the atmosphere depend on the rainfall, which in turn is largely dependent on the phase of El Niño–Southern Oscillation over this region. The results of a set of cloud-resolving simulations by a meteorology-chemistry model reveal that the large amount of fire aerosol particles emitted in this area acted to enhance the rainfall in September 2009, an otherwise dry El-Niño month. This enhancement was found to stem from increased ice and snow mass, likely due to reduced fallout of cloud water mass earlier in the development stage. This finding is in agreement with our previous finding from another El Niño year of 2015, indicating the microphysical effects of those fire particles slightly mitigating the dry conditions over the area in these El Niño years. The magnitude of the rain enhancement was larger for September of 2015 when the stronger El Niño led to a drier condition than September of 2009. Especially over land where the aerosol effect was most pronounced, the percentage increase of rainfall in 2015 was twice as large as that in 2009. Given the comparable aerosol optical depths between the two years in our simulations, we attribute the difference in the aerosol effect in 2009 and 2015 to the mid- and upper-tropospheric dryness that may or may not leave room for the convective invigoration by aerosols."

We show that satellite remote sensing data can effectively constrain these parameters, enabling us to produce the first global maps of ozone production rates with unprecedented resolution. 
 Ozone pollution is secondarily produced through a complex, non-linear chemical process. Our understanding of the spatiotemporal variations in photochemically produced ozone (i.e., PO3) is limited to sparse aircraft campaigns and chemical transport models, which often carry significant biases. Hence, we present a novel satellite-derived PO3 product informed by bias-corrected TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) HCHO, NO2, surface albedo data, and various models. These data are integrated into a parameterization that relies on HCHO, NO2, HCHO / NO2, jNO2, and jO1D. Despite its simplicity, it can reproduce ∼ 90 % of the variance in observationally constrained PO3, with minimal biases in moderately to highly polluted regions. We map PO3 across various regions with respect to July 2019 at a 0.1° × 0.1° spatial resolution, revealing accelerated values (> 8 ppbv h−1) for numerous cities throughout Asia and the Middle East, resulting from elevated ozone precursors and enhanced photochemistry. In Europe and the United States, such high levels are only detected over Benelux, Los Angeles, and New York City. PO3 maxima are observed in various seasons and are attributed to changes in photolysis rates, non-linear ozone chemistry, and fluctuations in HCHO and NO2. Satellite errors result in moderate errors (10 %–20 %) in PO3 estimates over cities on a monthly average basis, while these errors exceed 50 % in clean areas and under low light conditions. Using the current algorithm, we demonstrate that satellite data can provide valuable information for robust PO3 estimation. This capability expands future research through the application of data to address significant scientific questions about locally produced ozone hotspots, seasonality, and long-term trends."

This study examined the short‐term association of O3 with AMI onset in patients aged 18–55 years and explored differences by AMI subtypes and patient characteristics. We analyzed 2,322 AMI patients admitted to 103 US hospitals (2008–2012). Daily maximum 8‐hr O3 concentrations estimated using a spatiotemporal deep learning approach were assigned to participants' home addresses. We used a time‐stratified case‐crossover design with conditional logistic regression to assess the association between O3 and AMI, adjusting for fine particulate matter, air temperature, and relative humidity. We conducted stratified analyses to examine associations for AMI subtypes and effect modification by sociodemographic status, lifestyle factors, and medical history. An interquartile range (16.6 ppb) increase in O3 concentrations was associated with an increased AMI risk at lag 4 days (odds ratio [OR] = 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08–1.34) and lag 5 days (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.00–1.24). The association was more pronounced for non‐ST‐segment elevation AMI and type 2 AMI compared with ST‐segment elevation AMI and type 1 AMI, respectively. Stronger O3‐AMI associations were observed in non‐Hispanic Blacks than in non‐Hispanic Whites. Our study provides evidence that short‐term O3 exposure is associated with increased AMI risk in younger patients, with varying associations across AMI subtypes.

 Severe urban air pollution in China is driven by a synergistic conversion of SO2, NOx, and NH3 into fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Field studies indicated NO2 as an important oxidizer to SO2 in polluted atmospheres with low photochemical reactivity, but this rapid reaction cannot be explained by the aqueous reactive nitrogen chemistry in acidic urban aerosols. Here, using an aerosol optical tweezer and Raman spectroscopy, we show that the multiphase SO2 oxidation by NO2 is accelerated for two-order-of-magnitude by a copper catalyst. This reaction occurs on aerosol surfaces, is independent of pH between 3 and 5, and produces sulfate by a rate of up to 10 µg m-3air hr-1 when reactive copper reaches a millimolar concentration in aerosol water – typical of severe haze events in North China Plain. Since copper and NO2 are companion emitters in air pollution, they can act synergistically in converting SO2 into sulfate in China’s haze."

 NASA's Plankton, Aerosol, Clouds, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission, launched on 8th February 2024, carries a hyperspectral radiometer, Ocean Color Instrument (OCI) and two multi-angle polarimeters, Hyper Angular Rainbow Polarimeter (HARP2) and Spectro-Polarimeter for Planetary Exploration one (SPEX-one). The simultaneous deployment of these sensors offers an unprecedented opportunity to derive more accurate bidirectional factors for correcting the Sun-sensor viewing dependence of the remote sensing reflectance derived from OCI. With a bidirectional remote sensing model based on quasi-single-scattering approximation to the radiative transfer equation, the angular shape of the volume scattering function (VSF) in backward directions, i.e., the χ factor for particles (χp) is derived from the multi-angle observation of HARP2. The derived χp is in turn used to drive the bidirectional remote sensing model to predict the bidirectional factor. Testing with prelaunch simulated HARP2 L1C data that includes uncertainties due to atmospheric correction, the proposed method can estimate bidirectional factor with an uncertainty <10 % at any three visible bands of HARP2. Because the proposed method estimates the χp directly from the multi-angle observation, it fully accounts for the natural variability of VSFs, which were assumed to confine within a limited range of variation in the earlier bidirectional correction models."

 The main objective of this research, was to incorporate Mixed Layer Depth (MLD) estimations across backward air mass trajectories to the broadly used Trajectory Sector Analysis (TSA) and Concentration Weighted Trajectory (CWT) methods, in order to attain a three-dimensional (3D) identification of aerosol transport pathways and to reveal the role of the Mixed Layer (ML) on the transferring of particulates. The developed 3D-TSA and 3D-CWT tools, were combined with daily concentrations of PM10-bound SO42−, NO3−, Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+ and K+ measured at three rural sampling sites in Spain during the years 2019–2020. Vertically extended Saharan dust intrusions from North Africa were associated with air masses travelling both inside and outside the ML and were related to increases of PM10-bound SO42− and Ca2+ at all stations, attributed to the reactions of mineral dust with gaseous precursors of SO42− such as SO2. The advection of sea salt particles, marked by high levels of Na+ and Mg2+, was associated with marine air masses from the Mediterranean and Atlantic Ocean, moving mainly within the ML. Enhanced levels of PM10 constituents emitted by anthropogenic sources, such as NO3− (traffic and industrial emissions) and K+ (biomass burning), were clearly related to air masses originating from Iberian Peninsula, Central Europe and North African coastline, whilst in most cases the strongest contributions were transferred by air masses moving above the ML. Therefore, the implemented 3D version of TSA and CWT methods, revealed new information regarding the altitudinal characteristics of air masses affecting PM10 levels in Spain."

Model results are evaluated against aircraft, ground-based, and satellite observations. The improved understanding of life cycle, composition, transport pathways, and distribution of aerosols has important implications for characterizing aerosol–cloud–meteorology interactions over WNAO. 
 The Aerosol Cloud meTeorology Interactions oVer the western ATlantic Experiment (ACTIVATE) is a NASA mission to characterize aerosol–cloud interactions over the western North Atlantic Ocean (WNAO). Such characterization requires understanding of life cycle, composition, transport pathways, and distribution of aerosols over the WNAO. This study uses the GEOS-Chem model to simulate aerosol distributions and properties that are evaluated against aircraft, ground-based, and satellite observations during the winter and summer field deployments in 2020 of ACTIVATE. Transport in the boundary layer (BL) behind cold fronts was a major mechanism for the North American continental outflow of pollution to the WNAO in winter. Turbulent mixing was the main driver for the upward transport of sea salt within and ventilation out of BL in winter. The BL aerosol composition was dominated by sea salt, which increased in the summer, followed by organics and sulfate. Aircraft in situ aerosol measurements provided useful constraints on wet scavenging in GEOS-Chem. The model generally captured observed features such as continental outflow, land–ocean gradient, and mixing of anthropogenic aerosols with sea salt. Model sensitivity experiments with elevated smoke injection heights to the mid-troposphere (versus within BL) better reproduced observations of smoke aerosols from the western US wildfires over the WNAO in the summer. Model analysis suggests strong hygroscopic growth of sea salt particles and their seeding of marine BL clouds over the WNAO (< 35° N). Future modeling efforts should focus on improving parameterizations for aerosol wet scavenging, implementing realistic smoke injection heights, and applying high-resolution models that better resolve vertical transport."

Our year-long observations of aerosol physicochemical properties during the MOSAiC expedition reveal strong seasonal variations in aerosol chemical composition, where the short-term variability is heavily affected by storms in the Arctic. Local wind-generated particles are shown to be an important source of cloud seeds, especially in autumn. 
 Aerosols play a critical role in the Arctic's radiative balance, influencing solar radiation and cloud formation. Limited observations in the central Arctic leave gaps in understanding aerosol dynamics year-round, affecting model predictions of climate-relevant aerosol properties. Here, we present the first annual high-time-resolution observations of submicron aerosol chemical composition in the central Arctic during the Arctic Ocean 2018 (AO2018) and the 2019–2020 Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expeditions. Seasonal variations in the aerosol mass concentrations and chemical composition in the central Arctic were found to be driven by typical Arctic seasonal regimes and resemble those of pan-Arctic land-based stations. Organic aerosols dominated the pristine summer, while anthropogenic sulfate prevailed in autumn and spring under haze conditions. Ammonium, which impacts aerosol acidity, was consistently less abundant, relative to sulfate, in the central Arctic compared to lower latitudes of the Arctic. Cyclonic (storm) activity was found to have a significant influence on aerosol variability by enhancing emissions from local sources and the transport of remote aerosol. Local wind-generated particles contributed up to 80 % (20 %) of the cloud condensation nuclei population in autumn (spring). While the analysis presented herein provides the current central Arctic aerosol baseline, which will serve to improve climate model predictions in the region, it also underscores the importance of integrating short-timescale processes, such as seasonal wind-driven aerosol sources from blowing snow and open leads/ocean in model simulations. This is particularly important, given the decline in mid-latitude anthropogenic emissions and the increase in local ones."

Asian aerosols caused El Niño-like temperature patterns and slightly weakened the natural variation in the North Pacific, while reduced  emissions of western countries led to extensive warming in middle–high latitudes of the North Pacific. Human impacts on the Pacific climate may change when emission reduction occurs over Asia in the future. 
 The multi-decadal variations in the Pacific climate are extensively discussed as being influenced by external forcings such as greenhouse gases (GHGs) and anthropogenic aerosols (AAs). Unlike GHGs, the potential impacts of AAs could be more complex because of the heterogeneity of spatial distribution during the past few decades. Here we show, using regional aerosol forcing large-ensemble simulations with the Community Earth System Model 1 (CESM1), that the increasing fossil-fuel-related aerosol emissions over Asia (EastFF) and the reduction in aerosol emissions over North America and Europe (WestFF) have remarkably different impacts on driving the Pacific circulations and sea surface temperature (SST) changes since the 1980s. EastFF excites a typical El Niño-like SST pattern in the tropical Pacific and weakens the climatological Pacific Walker circulation. WestFF induces a central Pacific (CP)-type El Niño-like SST pattern with warming in the middle region of the equatorial Pacific, which is consistent with the second leading empirical orthogonal function (EOF) pattern of the observation. Over the North Pacific region, EastFF, located at low to middle latitudes, favors an Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO)-like SST pattern (horseshoe-like SST pattern in the North Pacific) through a teleconnection pathway between the tropical and extratropical Pacific but is overwhelmed by internal variability evolving from a positive phase to a negative IPO phase. In contrast, WestFF, located at middle to high latitudes, strongly affects the North Pacific via a west-to-east mid-latitude pathway and induces extensive warming. The competing effects of the heterogeneously distributed regional aerosol forcings are expected to exhibit different patterns in the near future, especially the redistribution of aerosol emissions within the domain of EastFF (i.e., from East Asia to South Asia) and changes in aerosol composition. The complex future changes in anthropogenic aerosol emissions are likely to introduce more profound impacts of aerosol forcing on the Pacific multi-decadal variations."

We also highlight the importance of quantifying natural emissions alongside anthropogenic emissions. 
 Accurate national methane (CH4) emission estimates are essential for tracking progress towards climate goals. This study investigated Finnish CH4 emissions from 2000–2021 using bottom-up and top-down approaches. We evaluated the ability of a global atmospheric inverse model CarbonTracker Europe – CH4 to estimate CH4 emissions within a single country. We focused on how different priors and their uncertainties affect the optimised emissions and showed that the optimised anthropogenic and natural CH4 emissions were strongly dependent on the prior emissions. However, while the range of CH4 estimates was large, the optimised emissions were more constrained than the bottom-up estimates. Further analysis showed that the optimisation aligned the trends of anthropogenic and natural CH4 emissions and improved the modelled seasonal cycles of natural emissions. Comparison of atmospheric CH4 observations with model results showed no clear preference between anthropogenic inventories (EDGAR v6 and CAMS-REG), but results using the highest natural prior (JSBACH–HIMMELI) agreed best with observations, suggesting that process-based models may underestimate CH4 emissions from Finnish peatlands or unaccounted sources such as freshwater emissions. Additionally, using an uncertainty estimate based on a process-based model ensemble for natural CH4 emissions seemed to be advantageous compared to the standard uncertainty definition. The average total posterior emission of the ensemble from one inverse model with different priors was similar to the average of the ensemble including different inverse models but similar priors. Thus, a single inverse model using a range of priors can be used to reliably estimate CH4 emissions when an ensemble of different models is unavailable."

Duffy;Brian Medeiros;Matvey Debolskiy,A new method for diagnosing effective radiative forcing from aerosol–cloud interactions in climate models,"We use satellite simulator data generated by global climate models to investigate how aerosol particles impact the radiative properties of liquid clouds. Specifically, we quantify the radiative perturbations arising from aerosol-driven changes in the number density of cloud droplets, the vertically integrated cloud water mass, and the cloud amount. Our results show that, in models, aerosol effects on the number density of cloud droplets contribute the most to anthropogenic climate forcing. 
 Aerosol–cloud interactions (ACIs) are a leading source of uncertainty in estimates of the historical effective radiative forcing (ERF). One reason for this uncertainty is the difficulty in estimating the ERF from aerosol–cloud interactions (ERFaci) in climate models, which typically requires multiple calls to the radiation code. Most commonly used methods also cannot disentangle the contributions from different processes to ERFaci. Here, we develop a new, computationally efficient method for estimating the shortwave (SW) ERFaci from liquid clouds using histograms of monthly averaged cloud fraction partitioned by cloud droplet effective radius (re) and liquid water path (LWP). Multiplying the histograms with SW cloud radiative kernels gives the total SW ERFaci from liquid clouds, which can be decomposed into contributions from the Twomey effect, LWP adjustments, and cloud fraction (CF) adjustments. We test the method with data from five CMIP6-era models, using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite instrument simulator to generate the histograms. Our method gives similar total SW ERFaci estimates to other established methods in regions of prevalent liquid cloud and indicates that the Twomey effect, LWP adjustments, and CF adjustments have contributed −0.34 ± 0.23, −0.22 ± 0.13, and −0.09 ± 0.11 W m−2, respectively, to the effective radiative forcing of the climate since 1850 in the ensemble mean (95 % confidence). These results demonstrate that widespread adoption of a MODIS re–LWP joint histogram diagnostic would allow the SW ERFaci and its components to be quickly and accurately diagnosed from climate model outputs, a crucial step for reducing uncertainty in the historical ERF."

Excellent agreement of the model and observations demonstrates the applicability of this approach to constrain photochemistry in such plumes. We identify limiting factors for the modeling accuracy and discuss spatial and spectral features of the distributions. 
 Biomass burning (BB) affects air quality and climate by releasing large quantities of gaseous and particulate pollutants into the atmosphere. Photochemical processing during daylight transforms these emissions, influencing their overall environmental impact. Accurately quantifying the photochemical drivers, namely actinic flux and photolysis frequencies, is crucial to constraining this chemistry. However, the complex radiative transfer within BB plumes presents a significant challenge for both direct observations and numerical models.This study introduces an expanded version of the 1D VLIDORT-QS radiative transfer (RT) model, named VLIDORT for photochemistry (VPC). VPC is designed for photochemical and remote sensing applications, particularly in BB plumes and other complex scenarios. To validate VPC and investigate photochemical conditions within BB plumes, the model was used to simulate spatial distributions of actinic fluxes and photolysis frequencies for the Shady wildfire (Idaho, US, 2019) based on plume composition data from the NOAA/NASA FIREX-AQ (Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality) campaign.Comparison between modeling results and observations by the CAFS (charged-coupled device actinic flux spectroradiometer) yields a modeling accuracy of 10 %–20 %. Systematic biases between the model and observations are within 2 %, indicating that the uncertainties are most likely due to variability in the input data caused by the inhomogeneity of the plume as well as 3D RT effects not captured in the model. Random uncertainties are largest in the ultraviolet (UV) spectral range, where they are dominated by uncertainties in the plume particle size distribution and brown carbon (BrC) absorptive properties.The modeled actinic fluxes show a decrease from the plume top to the bottom of the plume with a strong spectral dependence caused by BrC absorption, which darkens the plume towards shorter wavelengths. In the visible (Vis)  spectral range, actinic fluxes above the plume are enhanced by up to 60 %. In contrast, in the UV, actinic fluxes above the plume are not affected or even reduced by up to 10 %. Strong reductions exceeding an order of magnitude in and below the plume occur for both spectral ranges but are more pronounced in the UV."

Lee;Jie Gong;Guiping Liu,GNSS-RO residual ionospheric error (RIE): a new method and assessment,"Global Navigation Satellite System radio occultation data help monitor climate and weather prediction but are affected by residual ionospheric errors (RIEs). A new excess-phase-gradient method detects and corrects RIEs, showing both positive and negative values, varying by latitude, time, and solar activity. Tests show that RIE impacts polar stratosphere temperatures in models, with differences up to 3–4 K. This highlights the need for RIE correction to improve the accuracy of data assimilation. 
 Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) observations play an increasingly important role in monitoring climate changes and numerical weather forecasts in the upper troposphere and stratosphere. Because the magnitudes of the RO bending angle are small at these altitudes, quantifying and removing residual ionospheric error (RIE) are critical to accurately retrieve atmospheric temperature and refractivity. Yet, RIEs remain poorly characterized in terms of the global geographical distribution and its variations with the local time and altitude influenced by the solar cycle and solar geomagnetic disturbances. In this study we developed a new method to determine RIE from the RO excess phase measurement on a profile-by-profile basis. The method, called the ϕex-gradient (dϕex/dht) method, is self-sufficient and based on the vertical derivative of the RO excess phase (ϕex) with respect to tangent height (ht), which can be applied to individual RO bending angle observations for RIE correction. In addition to the RIE in bending angle measurements, RIEs can also be found in the RO ϕex measurements in the upper atmosphere where an exponential dependence is expected. RIEs are likely to impact the RO temperature retrieval by inducing a small-scale variance that is solar-cycle-dependent. We found that the RIE values derived from the dϕex/dht method can be both positive and negative, which is fundamentally different from the κ method that produces only  positive RIE values. The new algorithm reveals a latitude-dependent diurnal variation with a larger daytime negative RIE (up to ∼ 3 µrad) in the tropics and subtropics. Based on the observed RIE climatology, a local-time-dependent RIE representation is used to evaluate its impacts on reanalysis data. We examined these impacts by comparing the data  from the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) data assimilation (DA) system with and without the RIE. The RIE impact on GEOS DA temperature is mainly confined to the polar regions of the stratosphere. Between 10 and 1 hPa the temperature differences are ∼ 1 K and exceed ∼ 3–4 K in some cases. These results further highlight the need for RO RIE correction in  modern DA systems."

The fast synchronous multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (FS MAX-DOAS) successfully obtains gas profiles. This work can also be integrated with mobile platforms for navigational observation research, which is crucial for making mobile MAX-DOAS profile measurements. 
 This study investigates a multi-elevation fast synchronous multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (FS MAX-DOAS) observation system that can rapidly acquire trace gas profiles. It modifies the conventional MAX-DOAS method by sequentially scanning at elevation angles using motors. The new system incorporates a two-dimensional area array charge-coupled device (CCD) grating spectrometer, telescopes with a small field of view (< 1°), a high-speed shutter switching module, and a multi-mode multi-core fiber to enable multi-channel spectroscopy and significantly enhance the time resolution of the collected spectra (one elevation cycle within 2 min). When selecting the spectrometer grating, the impact of the spectral resolution on the detection of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and formaldehyde (HCHO) by FS MAX-DOAS was simulated and analyzed. The optimal resolution range was determined to be 0.3–0.6 nm. The selection of the number of binning rows in the acquisition settings considers the signal-to-noise ratio of the pixels in each row to enhance the quality of the spectral data. Two-step acquisition is used for low elevation angles within one cycle to overcome the influence of variations in light intensity. A comparative test was conducted on outfield NO2 and HCHO measurements using differential optical absorption spectroscopy. Compared with the differential slant column densities (dSCDs) at each elevation angle measured by the MAX-DOAS system, the Pearson correlation coefficient of NO2 reached 0.9, while for HCHO it ranged mostly between 0.76 and 0.85. The results of the slant column concentration inversion indicate that the root mean square (rms) of the FS MAX-DOAS spectrum inversion can consistently be lower than that of MAX-DOAS over an extended period. The profile results show that the diurnal variation trend of the two systems was consistent, and because of the enhanced time resolution, the gas profile obtained by the former system can provide more detailed information. Compared with the near-ground NO2 concentration measured by the long-path DOAS (LP-DOAS) system, the daily variation trend shows a characteristic of being high in the morning and starting to decrease at noon, and the correlation coefficient between FS MAX-DOAS and LP-DOAS is higher (R = 0.901). The FS MAX-DOAS system can quickly and simultaneously obtain the vertical distribution profiles of NO2 and HCHO with high accuracy, providing a basis for mobile MAX-DOAS to achieve gas profile inversion."

 Continuous ground-based remote sensing measurements were conducted during the Pallas Cloud Experiment (PaCE) 2022 campaign. Remote sensing instruments, including two ceilometers (models CL31 and CL61, Vaisala Oyj), a Doppler cloud radar (model RPG-FMCW-94, RPG Radiometer Physics GmbH), and a Doppler wind lidar (model StreamLine XR, HALO Photonics), were deployed at Kenttärova, Finland, a measurement station that is part of the Pallas Atmosphere–Ecosystem Supersite.

Soil represents a potentially important source of VOCs. However, the VOC emission characteristics of soils from different urban and natural environments remain unclear. In this study, the composition and flux of VOCs emitted from various soil types were examined. Results reveal significantly elevated VOC emissions from polluted soils, with levels 2 orders of magnitude higher than those from their natural counterparts. Influences of light, soil water content, and temperature on VOC emissions were explored. Light exposure notably enhanced the emissions of certain VOCs, such as acetonitrile, from highly polluted industrial soils. Simultaneously, reductions in VOCs such as terpenes were observed, possibly driven by photochemical degradation processes. By comparison, soils from less polluted environments exhibited minimal changes in VOC emissions under light exposure, emphasizing the distinct behaviors of different soil types. Soil water content was inversely correlated with VOC emission rates, likely due to reduced soil porosity and permeability at higher moisture levels, whereas temperature exhibited intricate effects on soil emissions that  varied with VOC species. Factors such as soil VOC storage, VOC “affinity” to soil, and microbial activities may play roles and warrant future investigation. Results from this study highlight soil emissions as non-negligible contributors to ambient VOC levels and underscore the crucial impacts of environmental factors in modulating these emissions."

 The optical properties of brown carbon (BrC) and their correlation with chemical characteristics remained inadequately understood in different regions worldwide. This study investigated the correlations and estimated the subsequent radiative effects using real-time measurements during wintertime in the Sichuan Basin, China. The average light absorption of BrC (AbsBrC) at 370 nm constituted 35.5 ± 8.2 % of total absorption, significantly higher than those at 470 nm (20.9 ± 4.3 %), 590 nm (14.0 ± 2.5 %), and 660 nm (7.7 ± 2.1 %) (p < 0.001). The contributions of various organic aerosol (OA) sources to AbsBrC varied by wavelength, with biomass-burning OA (BBOA) and semi-volatile oxygenated OA (SVOOA) exhibiting the higher Abs (14.4 Mm−1 and 13.5 Mm−1), absorption Ångström exponents (AAE) (4.81 and 4.35), and contributions to AbsBrC (24.4 % and 22.8 %). Additionally, secondary BrC likely formed from BBOA through aqueous-phase reactions during winter. The transport of BBOA and SVOOA from northern regions (i.e., Guang'an in Sichuan and Hechuan in Chongqing) significantly contributed to elevated Abs370,BrC levels. The mean simple forcing efficiency for BrC (SFEBrC) was 60.5 W g−1, accounting for 14 % of SFEBC in the 370–880 nm range during winter. Overall, this study enhanced the understanding of AbsBrC and its evolution with sources, providing a more accurate assessment of its radiative effects, and emphasized the importance of biomass burning emissions."

Yet, wildfires rely on the availability of ignition and fuel, which are underrepresented in fire forecast and prediction practices. By analyzing satellite measurements and atmospheric reanalysis, here we show that near-surface weather only partially captures wildfire occurrence and intensity across the daily to seasonal timescales. Beyond near-surface weather, convection and fuel abundance play a complementary role in regulating burning processes. Specifically, enhanced atmospheric convection is identified for over 40% of the low-human-impact regions and 61% of global burnable areas during wildfire ignition and spreading periods. Meanwhile, 56% of shrublands and 54% of grasslands see higher fuel load with actual occurrence of fire. Our results highlight the role of convection and fuel in wildfire forecast, prompting a revisit of wildfire prediction under intertwined atmospheric and terrestrial changes."

The multiple reanalysis system comparison allows an evaluation of the dependency of the impacts on different reanalysis systems. The results suggested the importance of satellite ozone and its precursor measurements for improving ozone analysis in the whole troposphere, with varying magnitudes among the systems. 
 Chemical reanalysis products have been produced by integrating various satellite observational data to provide comprehensive information on atmospheric composition. Five global chemical reanalysis datasets were used to evaluate the relative impacts of assimilating satellite ozone and its precursor measurements on surface and free-tropospheric ozone analyses for the year 2010. Observing system experiments (OSEs) were conducted with multiple reanalysis systems under similar settings to evaluate the impacts of reanalysis system selection on the quantification of observing system values. Without data assimilation, large discrepancies remained among the control runs owing to model biases. Data assimilation improved the consistency among the systems, reducing the standard deviation by 72 %–88 % in the lower troposphere through the lower stratosphere, while improving agreement with independent ozonesonde observations. The OSEs suggested the importance of precursor measurements, especially from tropospheric NO2 columns, for improving ozone analysis in the lower troposphere, with varying influences among the systems (increases in global lower-tropospheric ozone by 0.1 % in GEOS-Chem and 7 % in Tropospheric Chemistry Reanalysis version 2 (TCR-2), with only NO2 assimilation). Adjustments made by direct ozone assimilation showed similar vertical patterns between the TCR-2 and IASI-r systems, with increases of 6 %–22 % and decreases of 2 %–21 % in the middle and upper troposphere, respectively, reflecting the biases of the forecast models. These results suggest the importance of considering the effects of the forecast model performance and data assimilation configurations when assessing the observing system impacts to provide unbiased evaluations of satellite systems and to guide the design of future observing systems."

Santee,Satellite nadir-viewing geometry affects the magnitude and detectability of long-term trends in stratospheric ozone,"The recovery of the ozone hole since the 1987 Montreal Protocol has been observed in some regions but has yet to be seen globally. We ask how long it will take to witness a global recovery. Using a technique akin to flying a virtual satellite in a climate model, we find that the degree of confidence we place in the answer to this question is dramatically affected by errors in satellite observations. 
 The continued monitoring of the ozone layer and its long-term evolution leans on comparative studies of merged satellite records. Comparing such records presents unique challenges due to differences in sampling, coverage, and retrieval algorithms between observing platforms, all of which complicate the detection of trends. Here we examine the effects of broad nadir averaging kernels on vertically resolved ozone trends, using one record as an example. We find errors as large as 1 % per decade and displacements in trend profile features by as much as 6 km in altitude due to the vertical redistribution of information by averaging kernels. Furthermore, we show that averaging kernels tend to increase (by 10 %–80 %, depending on the location) the length of the record needed to determine whether trend estimates are distinguishable from natural variability with good statistical confidence. We conclude that trend uncertainties may be underestimated, in part because averaging kernels misrepresent decadal to multidecadal internal variability, and in part because the removal of known modes of variability from the observed record can yield residual errors. The study provides a framework to reconcile differences between observing platforms and highlights the need for caution when using records from instruments with broad averaging kernels to quantify trends and their uncertainties."

While it is widely recognized that Eo may increase in a warming climate, recent studies have reported a diminished increase in the global water vapor since ∼2000s, raising doubts about recent changes in Eo. Using satellite observations, here we show that while global Eo strongly increased from 1988 to 2017, the upward trend reversed in the late 2000s. Since then, two‐thirds of the ocean have experienced weakened evaporation, leading to a slight decreasing trend in global‐averaged Eo during 2008–2017. This suggests that even with saturated surface, a warmer climate does not always result in increased evaporation. The reversal in Eo trend is primarily attributed to wind stilling, which is likely tied to the Northern Oscillation Index shifting from positive to negative phases. These findings offer crucial insights into diverse responses of global hydrological cycle to climate change."

The Great Lakes region, containing the largest network of freshwater lakes in the world, and a significant urbanized population exceeding 20 million, provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the potential for lacustrine (lake‐associated) surfaces to contribute to regional ammonia levels. In this work, we combine an analysis of 20 years of water quality data from the Great Lakes region with the GEM‐MACH (Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM)‐Modelling Air quality and CHemistry (MACH)) chemical transport model to examine the influence of the Great Lakes on atmospheric ammonia. This analysis demonstrates that while regional ammonia levels are largely controlled by known terrestrial anthropogenic sources, lacustrine surfaces with an emission potential of only 200 increase summertime (July–September) monthly average ammonia (NH3) levels by 5%–8% over the largest regional urban centers, with daily increases of up to 10%–20%. Supplemental water measurements collected from within 1 km offshore of the Greater Toronto Area were found to have an emission potential of 2000, suggesting that lacustrine emissions offshore of large urban areas could be significantly larger than those predicted by GEM‐MACH.

In this study, an effort is made to see if all‐sky TB simulations from short‐term model forecasts by a radiative transfer model could capture observed low‐TB distributions. We employ a coupled ocean‐atmosphere Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model at 3‐km resolution and the European Center for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis v5 (ERA5) and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) analysis as initial conditions. Horizontal structural distributions of all‐sky TB simulations initialized by the NCEP GFS analysis better match AGRI observations than the ERA5 reanalysis, including the eyewall, moat and spiral rainband distributions of Typhoon Lekima. The cloud top pressure in most cloud areas near the center of Lekima is around 140 hPa, whereas in some rainbands far from the center is approximately 700 hPa. A high correlation in horizontal distributions of all‐sky TB simulations with relative vorticity fields during the 24‐hr period of WRF model forecasts suggests a potential relationship between dynamic and thermodynamic variables. The farther from the center of Lekima, the greater the proportion of high‐wavenumber structures within both TB and relative vorticity fields. Within the radius of maximum wind speed, the azimuthal wavenumbers 0, 1, and 2 shown in TB and relative vorticity fields have greater comparability. High wavenumber structures in relative vorticity increase with radial distance in a way faster than those in TB."

Peatland fires require sufficiently hot, dry conditions and/or drainage for the peat to burn. Although these conditions have historically been infrequent, the warming and drying climate could increase the potential for wildfires and subsequent emissions. Here, we evaluate how climate change impacts peatland fire emissions by using the United Kingdom as a case study—where peatlands store an estimated 3.2 PgC. We use a fire emission model to quantify fire-driven C emissions using high-resolution land-surface data and fire-weather indices. Between 2001 and 2021, we estimate 0.8 TgC has been emitted from fires on peatlands, which can contribute up to 90% of total annual UK fire-driven C emissions. Consequently, protecting peatlands from fires in the UK would be a cost-effective way to slow climate change by avoiding future emissions. Peatland emissions spike during prominent dry years, implicating the inter-annual climate as a dominant driver of year-to-year variability. Integrating future climate projections suggests that a 2 °C global warming level could increase fire-driven C emissions in peatlands by over 60% solely via increased burn depths. Our findings are likely a bellwether for other temperate peatlands where climate change is leading to drier conditions, which increase burn depths and C emissions."

We evaluate the ability of global models to replicate the observed historical dust variability by using the emission dataset to force a historical simulation in an Earth system model. We show that prescribing our emissions forces the model to better match observations than other mechanistic models. 
 Sedimentary records indicate that atmospheric dust has increased substantially since preindustrial times. However, state-of-the-art global Earth system models (ESMs) are unable to capture this historical increase, posing challenges in assessing the impacts of desert dust on Earth's climate. To address this issue, we construct a globally gridded dust emission dataset (DustCOMMv1) spanning 1841–2000. We do so by combining 19 sedimentary records of dust deposition with observational and modeling constraints on the modern-day dust cycle. The derived emission dataset contains interdecadal variability of dust emissions as forced by the deposition flux records, which increased by approximately 50 % from 1851–1870 to 1981–2000. We further provide future dust emission datasets for 2000–2100 by assuming three possible scenarios for how future dust emissions will evolve. We evaluate the historical dust emission dataset and illustrate its effectiveness in enforcing a historical dust increase in ESMs by conducting a long-term (1851–2000) dust cycle simulation with the Community Earth System Model (CESM2). The simulated dust depositions are in reasonable agreement with the long-term increase in most sedimentary dust deposition records and with measured long-term trends in dust concentration at sites in Miami and Barbados. This contrasts with the CESM2 simulations using a process-based dust emission scheme and with simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), which show little to no secular trends in dust deposition, concentration, and optical depth. The DustCOMM emissions thus enable ESMs to account for the historical radiative forcings (RFs), including due to dust direct interactions with radiation (direct RF). Our CESM2 simulations estimate a 1981–2000 minus 1851–1870 direct RF of −0.10 W m−2 by dust aerosols up to 10 µm in diameter (PM10) at the top of atmosphere (TOA). This global dust emission dataset thus enables models to more accurately account for historical aerosol forcings, thereby improving climate change projections such as those in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment reports."

Zawadowicz;Paquita Zuidema,Burning conditions and transportation pathways determine biomass-burning aerosol properties in the Ascension Island marine boundary layer,"Biomass-burning aerosol is commonly present in the marine boundary layer over the southeast Atlantic Ocean between June and October. Our research indicates that burning conditions, aerosol transport pathways, and prolonged oxidation processes (heterogeneous and aqueous phases) determine the chemical, microphysical, and optical properties of the boundary layer aerosol. Notably, we find that the aerosol optical properties can be estimated from the chemical properties alone. 
 African biomass-burning aerosol (BBA) in the southeast Atlantic Ocean (SEA) marine boundary layer (MBL) is an important contributor to Earth's radiation budget, yet its representation remains poorly constrained in regional and global climate models. Data from the Layered Atlantic Smoke Interactions with Clouds (LASIC) field campaign on Ascension Island (7.95° S, 14.36° W) provide insight into how burning conditions, fuel type, transport pathways, and atmospheric processing affect the chemical, microphysical, and optical properties of BBA between June and September 2017. A total of 10 individual plume events characterize the seasonal evolution of the BBA properties. Early-season inefficient fires, determined by low refractory black carbon to above-background carbon monoxide mixing ratios (rBC : ΔCO), led to enhanced concentrations of organic- and sulfate-rich aerosols. Mid-season efficient fires, determined by higher rBC : ΔCO values, led to rBC-enriched BBA. A mix of efficient and inefficient fires later in the season resulted in conflicting BBA properties. Prolonged transport (∼ 10 d) through the MBL and lower free troposphere (FT) facilitated chemical and aqueous-phase processing, which led to a reduction in organic aerosol mass concentrations. This resulted in lower organic aerosol (OA) to rBC (OA : rBC) mass ratios (2–5) in the MBL compared to higher values (5–15) in the nearby FT.

Source attribution is quantified by the local thermodynamics of the combustion temperature (NOx/NO2). Emission results identify sources which do not exist in the a priori datasets, especially medium industrial sources located next to the Yangtze River. 
 This study applies a mass-conserving model-free analytical approach to daily observations on a grid-by-grid basis of NO2 from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) to rapidly and flexibly quantify changing and emerging sources of NOx emissions at high spatial and daily temporal resolution. The inverted NOx emissions and optimized underlying ranges include quantification of the underlying atmospheric in situ processing, transport, and physics. The results are presented over three changing regions in China, including Shandong and Hubei, which are rapidly urbanizing and not frequently addressed in the global literature. The day-to-day and grid-by-grid emissions are found to be 1.96 ± 0.27 µg m−2 s−1 on pixels with available a priori values (1.94 µg m−2 s−1), while 1.22 ± 0.63 µg m−2 s−1 extra emissions are found on pixels in which the a priori inventory is lower than 0.3 µg m−2 s−1. Source attribution based on the thermodynamics of combustion temperature, atmospheric transport, and in situ atmospheric processing successfully identifies five different industrial source types. Emissions from these industrial sites adjacent to the Yangtze River are found to be 161. ± 68.9 Kt yr−1 (163 % higher than the a priori), consistent with missing light and medium industries located along the river, contradicting previous studies attributing water as the source of NOx emissions. Finally, the results reveal pixels with an uncertainty larger than day-to-day variability, providing quantitative information for placement of future monitoring stations. It is hoped that these findings will drive a new approach to top-down emissions estimates, in which emissions are quantified and updated continuously based consistently on remotely sensed measurements and associated uncertainties that actively reflect land-use changes and quantify misidentified emissions, while quantifying new datasets to inform the bottom-up emissions community."

Waxman;Lu Xu;Kristen Zuraski;Andreas Wahner;Anna Novelli,Advances in an OH reactivity instrument for airborne field measurements,"Significant improvements have been made to the instruments used to measure OH reactivity, which is equivalent to the sum of air pollutant concentrations. Accurate and precise measurements with a high time resolution have been achieved, allowing use on aircraft, as demonstrated during flights in the USA. 
 Hydroxyl radical (OH) reactivity, which is the inverse lifetime of the OH radical, provides information on the burden of air pollutants, since almost all air pollutants react with OH. OH reactivity measurements from field experiments can help to identify gaps in the measurement of individual reactants and serve as a proxy for the potential formation of secondary pollutants, including ozone and particles. However, OH reactivity is not regularly measured specifically on airborne platforms due to the technical complexity of the instruments and/or the need for careful instrumental characterisation to apply accurate correction factors to account for secondary chemistry in the instruments. The method used in this work, based on the time-resolved measurement of OH radicals produced by laser flash photolysis in a flow tube, does not require corrections as secondary chemistry in the instrument is negligible for typical atmospheric conditions. However, the detection of OH radicals by laser-induced fluorescence is challenging. In this work, an OH reactivity instrument has been further developed specifically for airborne measurements. The laser system used to detect the OH radicals has been simplified compared to previous setups, thereby significantly reducing the need for user interaction. The improved sensitivity allows measurements to be made with a high time resolution on the order of seconds and a measurement precision of 0.3 s−1. The OH reactivity measurements were validated using a propane gas standard, which allowed the determination of the reaction rate constant of the OH reaction with propane. The values are in excellent agreement with literature recommendations within a range of 4 % to 8 %. Deviations are well within the combined uncertainties. The accuracy of the OH reactivity measurements is mainly limited by the determination of the instrumental zero, which has a typical maximum uncertainty of 0.5 s−1. The high sensitivity of the improved instrument facilitates the data acquisition on board an aircraft as demonstrated by its deployment during the AEROMMA (Atmospheric Emissions and Reactions Observed from Megacities to Marine Areas) campaign in 2023."

In this study, an approach to construct the 3D spatial distribution of the FNR in the lower troposphere was proposed. Based on satellite and multiaxes-differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) data, the horizontal and vertical distributions of the FNR have been respectively obtained. To further enhance the generalizability of this approach, we also reproduced the vertical profiles of the FNR using a machine learning model (Bagged trees) and feature variables. Here, using the three-dimensional distribution of the FNR during the summer of 2019 as an example, a fourth-order polynomial relationship was found between the reconstruction factors (fcol_i) and altitudes, demonstrating a correlation coefficient of 0.98. Utilizing this established relationship, a significant difference was found between the reconstructed surface FNR and the satellite column FNR, with the former decreasing by 56.9%. Moreover, the reconstructed 3D spatial distribution of the FNR for the summers from 2018 to 2022 revealed a trend over the five years in Shanghai of the ozone formation control regimes gradually shifting toward the transition and NOx-limited regimes. Through this newly established approach, not only can the accuracy of identifying surface ozone sensitivity be enhanced from the spaced observation, but also it helps in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the ozone photochemical formation mechanisms in the vertical direction."

 Fires are a major source of air pollutants in Southeast Asia. Over the past few decades, there has been an increase in fire activities in this region, and the causes are not entirely clear. By analyzing multiple observational and reanalysis datasets, as well as conducting climate model simulations, we uncover a distinct positive impact of Arctic sea ice loss on Southeast Asian fire weather. There is a possibility that the fall in the autumn Sea Ice Concentration (SIC) over the Beaufort Sea the year prior contributes to the increase in boreal spring fire activity in Southeast Asia. This sea ice reduction generates a local low warm anomaly, triggering an upper atmosphere Rossby wave train that propagates from the tropical Pacific to Southeast Asia and arrives in Southeast Asia as a high-pressure anomaly with descending air. Moreover, two meridional cells originating from equatorial and polar regions intensify the sinking airflow. This Arctic-driven teleconnection causes high pressure with warmer and dryer surfaces in Southeast Asia, creating favorable conditions for fire ignition and expansion. Based on the fire weather classification criteria, a negative change in SIC of one standard deviation below the climatological mean will expose over 500 million people to very high levels of fire pollution across Southeast Asia, and the number of people exposed to extreme fires will be 1000 times greater than in the present scenario. The above-mentioned mechanism has great implications for projecting decadal air quality and developing relevant health policies to cope with climate change in Southeast Asia."

 Human well-being relies on the presence and role of pollinators, as they contribute to the vitality of ecosystems, support the reproduction of wild plants, increase crop yields, and strengthen overall food security. While wild bee populations are dwindling due to climate and environmental change, there has been a notable 45% rise globally in the number of managed honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies over the past five decades. Given their economic significance and their relative ease of tracking, honey bees have the potential to serve as bioindicators of global pollinator health. Consequently, honey bees have emerged as a keystone species requiring protection and conservation efforts. Here, we investigate the intricate relationship between air quality, environmental factors, and honey bee mortality across Canada and the United States. Using statistical and machine learning modeling, our findings underscore the honey bee’s role as a bioindicator. We found that air quality is an important predictor of honey bee mortality. The risk of honey bee mortality increased with poor air quality (ozone and Air Quality Health Index) but was substantially reduced in regions with greater vegetation availability (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). Therefore, our study offers a beacon of hope: improving management practices by increasing greenery can significantly mitigate the impact of deteriorating air quality on honey bees, providing a vital solution to safeguard our essential pollinators. Increased ozone concentration and air quality health index increases the probability of honey bee mortality across Canada and the USA, according to a machine learning model study utilising apiary tracking data and environmental data."

 Stratospheric aerosol injection could mitigate harmful effects of global warming, but could have undesirable side effects, such as warming the stratosphere and depleting the ozone layer. We explore the potential benefits of solid alumina and calcite particles as alternatives to sulfate aerosols by using an experimentally informed aerosol-chemistry-climate model. Compared to sulfur dioxide, injection of solids reduces stratospheric warming by up to 70% and diffuse radiation by up to 40%, highlighting their potential benefits. Achieving −1 W m−2 of radiative forcing would likely result in very small ozone changes, but sizable uncertainties remain. These arise from poorly understood heterogeneous chemical and microphysical processes, which, under less likely assumptions, could lead to larger global ozone column changes between −14% and +4%. Our work provides recommendations for improving the understanding of stratospheric aerosol injection using materials other than sulfur dioxide, and underscores the need for kinetic laboratory studies.

 Serious bumps caused by clear air turbulence (CAT) pose significant safety hazards during flight. CAT is also a mechanism of the stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE), influencing the mixing of trace gases in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). The strong vertical wind shear in the upper level induced by the large topography and unique climatic conditions facilitate the formation of CAT over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). This paper utilizes ERA5 reanalysis data from 1979 to 2019 to investigate the distribution characteristics of CAT over the TP. Additionally, the effects of tropopause folds on CAT were also discussed. Finally, we compare the rate of ozone change in the UTLS between cases with folds but no CAT and those with both folds and CAT, using CAMS ozone reanalysis data from 2003 to 2019. Results indicate that the occurrence frequency of CAT over the TP is significantly higher than in surrounding areas. CAT is more frequent in winter and spring, with a significant increasing trend in winter over the past 40 years. The distribution and intensity of CAT are correlated with the subtropical westerly jet stream, occurring both above and below the jet axis, showing stronger CAT observed beneath the axis. Additionally, tropopause folds significantly enhance the frequency and intensity of CAT, especially as the depth of the fold increases. CAT intensifies STE associated with folds, leading to a reduction in stratospheric ozone and a corresponding increase in tropospheric ozone."

 Atmospheric weighted mean temperature (Tm) is an important parameter in the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) meteorology, essential for retrieving precipitable water vapor (PWV). The FengYun-4 satellite (FY-4) carries Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS), which realizes the transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional detection of the vertical structure of the atmosphere in geostationary orbit, providing a more convenient and accurate data source for the inversion of Tm. The study presents a novel approach for deriving the Tm based on the GIIRS products of FengYun-4A satellite (FY-4A) and FengYun-4B satellite (FY-4B). The Tm calculated from the radiosonde data is utilized as reference to assess the performance of FY-4A and FY-4B, which demonstrates that the GIIRS equipped on FY-4 can provide a new way to obtain the Tm. The numerical results show that the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) are 1.65/ 2.06 K and 1.38/ 1.73 K for FY-4A and FY-4B, respectively. The different performance of FY-4A and FY-4B on Tm are also observed from the analysis of the geographical distribution, seasons and epochs. Specifically, the RMSE distribution of FY-4A at different stations ranges from 1.08 to 3.47 K, while the distribution of FY-4B is more concentrated between 1.37 and 2.70 K. The accuracy of FY-4 A deteriorates as increasing latitude, while the phenomenon is not obvious for FY-4B. Moreover, FY-4 A performs slightly better at UTC 0:00 than at UTC 12:00, while FY-4B has a slightly better performance in autumn than in other seasons."

This study employs the HYSPLIT model, a Lagrangian atmospheric transport and dispersion model, along with satellite retrievals of SO2 ${\text{SO}}_{2}$ cloud properties to model the long range transport of the cloud. To reduce the uncertainty and complexity of modeling the near‐source behavior of the umbrella cloud, we utilize a data insertion technique that initializes the model at a downwind plume location. Satellite retrievals provide estimates of column mass loading and plume top height, though the plume top height may be uncertain above the tropopause. Additionally, the vertical mass distribution must be estimated by making assumptions about the cloud thickness. We use a back trajectory analysis to provide better estimations of plume top height and thickness. Our findings reveal that trajectory‐derived cloud top heights substantially exceeded satellite estimates, with 60% ranging between 20 and 40 km, compared to most satellite‐derived estimates being around 15 km. Long range 5‐day forecasts produced with data insertion using the revised cloud top heights and estimated thickness are compared with forecasts using retrieved cloud top heights and an assumed simple thickness of 1 km, and a control run initiated from the vent at the eruption start time. A qualitative comparison with satellite retrievals and data from ground based lidar stationed at Réunion Island shows the use of the back trajectory analysis significantly improves the forecast."

In order to understand the impacts and consequences of climate interventions such as stratospheric aerosol injection, complex models are often necessary. We use a case study to illustrate how we can understand the inner workings of a complex model. We present this technique as an exploratory tool that can be used to quickly discover and assess relationships in complex climate data. 
 Machine learning (ML) models are commonly used to generate predictions, but these models can also support the discovery of new science. Generating accurate predictions necessitates that a model captures the structure of the underlying data. If the structure is properly extracted, ML could be a useful exploratory and evidential tool. In this paper, we present a case study that demonstrates the use of ML for exploratory data analysis (EDA) in the climate space. We apply the ML explainability method of spatiotemporal zeroed feature importance (stZFI) to understand how climate-variable associations evolve over space and time. Our analyses focus on data from ensembles of Earth system models (ESMs) which provide data on different climate states and conditions. We elect to work with ESM ensembles since they allow us to compare feature importance across alternative scenarios not available with observed data. The ensembles also account for natural variability so that we can distinguish between signal and noise due to natural climate variability when computing feature importance. The use of perturbed initial condition ensembles introduces variability mimicking the natural variability in the atmosphere; thus the signals emerging using feature importance (FI) can be evaluated against the natural variability in the climate system. For our analyses, we consider the 1991 volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo, which was a large stratospheric aerosol injection. We explore the climate pathway associated with the eruption from aerosols to radiation to temperature at both the near-surface and stratospheric levels. In addition to applying the method to data generated from two different ESMs, we apply stZFI to reanalysis data to compare the associations identified by stZFI. We show how stZFI tracks the importance of aerosol optical depth over time on forecasting temperatures. This case study illustrates usefulness of an ML tool (stZFI) for EDA on a well-studied climate exemplar."

The sudden acceleration of the increasing extreme precipitation is largely attributed to the reverse in aerosol trends associated with China’s clean air actions, which affects extreme precipitation through perturbing cloud microphysics and atmospheric dynamics, accounting for half of the change in R95pTOT trends. Future aerosol reduction to achieve carbon neutrality is shown to continue to intensify the extreme precipitation, which overweighs the effect induced by GHGs, highlighting the importance of aerosol changes in modulating future climate and weather extremes."

Key driving factors include the growing temperature contrast between land and sea, increasing solar radiation, and the weakening background winds. The study suggests that the increasing SLB frequency will enhance air pollutant accumulations, making it challenging to manage air quality effectively in these coastal areas."

 Understanding the relationship between tropical heavy rainfall and large-scale circulation provides valuable insights for improving the climate models. Here we use Gaussian Mixture Model to identify two distinct types of heavy rainfall over the tropical Pacific, “strong deep convection” and “moderately strong deep convection,” using satellite-borne precipitation radar measurements. They differ in two typical climatological deep convection-related rainfall modes between the western and eastern Pacific regions. The occurrence frequency of moderately strong deep convection is significantly different between the western and eastern Pacific, potentially linked to the Walker circulation. The enhanced Walker circulation appears to weaken the local Hadley circulation, thereby reducing strong deep convective activity in the eastern Pacific. This increases moderately heavy rainfall and decreases diabatic heating, which can affect global climate. We propose incorporating the close link between large-scale Walker circulation and mesoscale heavy convective rainfall into the current climate models. Tropical Pacific experiences two types of heavy rainfall including strong deep convection and moderately strong deep convection, which vary by region and are linked to the Walker circulation, according to satellite-borne precipitation radar measurements."

 The limited number of PM2.5 monitoring stations from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) across the Contiguous United States (CONUS) restricts PM2.5 monitoring and associated policymaking efforts. Low-cost PM2.5 stations, such as those from the PurpleAir network, offer a vital alternative to expand coverage in regions not monitored by the EPA. However, the accuracy of PurpleAir measurements has been questioned. This study introduces a deep learning (DL) approach, specifically a deep convolutional neural network (DeepCNN), to align hourly PM2.5 data from PurpleAir with EPA PM2.5 observations across the CONUS for the year 2021. Utilizing over nine million samples from 1595 PurpleAir stations located within 5 km of EPA stations, the DeepCNN demonstrates significant improvements in the agreement between PurpleAir and EPA observations. It increases the correlation coefficient (R) with EPA observations from 0.58 to 0.85 and reduces the mean absolute bias (MAB) from 4.99 to 2.98 μg/m3, achieving a 40% reduction in bias. The state-wise cross-validation also underscores the model's generalizability, with an average 11% improvement in R values and a 13% reduction in bias between PurpleAir and EPA PM2.5 measurements in various states. Comparative analysis reveals that the accuracy of our DL-enhanced PurpleAir PM2.5 (PM-DL) data significantly surpasses that of five previously established PurpleAir correction models, which show low R values of 0.55–0.58 and MABs ranging from 4.21 to 6.43 μg/m3 when validated against EPA data. This study underscores the need for more sophisticated models to better align PurpleAir PM2.5 measurements to EPA standards. The PM-DL data can substantially mitigate the scarcity of reliable institutional PM2.5 observations across the CONUS. By aligning PurpleAir PM2.5 data with EPA observations, our model has the potential to augment the existing network with over ten thousand accurate monitoring stations, significantly expanding upon the nearly one thousand EPA stations currently in operation."

This study investigates the spatial distribution and long-range transport dynamics of VOCs over South Korea, using airborne observations conducted during the 2024 Asian Air Quality campaign. VOC concentrations were measured in urban, industrial, and long-range transport scenarios using proton transfer reaction-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MS) and gas chromatography–MS with canister sampling. The results demonstrate that benzene shows significant vertical and spatial dispersion during long-range transport due to its intermediate atmospheric lifetime, which allows it to persist and impact downwind air quality. Additionally, Chlorinated VOCs, such as 1,2-dichloroethane and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, display transport behaviors. Their relatively consistent concentrations during long-range transport emphasize the influence of industrial activities, including coal combustion and petrochemical processes, as major sources. Elevated levels of chlorinated VOCs were primarily associated with emissions from industrial regions in Chungnam, while aromatic VOCs were predominantly linked to urban traffic emissions. These findings underscore the need for international cooperation to combat transboundary pollution and highlight the importance of comprehensive air quality management strategies that address both urban and industrial emission sources. This study provides essential insights into the atmospheric behavior of VOCs and emphasizes the need for targeted policies to effectively regulate air pollution."

Our study analysed air quality data from 2003 to 2020 on the island Utö and employed modelling, showing a continuous decrease in SO2 concentrations since 2003 and thus evidencing the effectiveness of such regulations in improving air quality. It also underscored the importance of long-term, high-resolution monitoring at remote marine sites. 
 The designation of the Baltic Sea as a sulfur emission control area (SECA) in May 2006, with subsequent tightening of regulations in 2010 and 2015, has reduced the sulfuric emission from shipping traffic. This study assesses the impacts of SECA on observed SO2 concentrations by providing a long-term analysis of 1 min time-resolution air quality data from 2006 to 2020 on Utö (an island in the Baltic Sea) supported by the predictions from the Ship Traffic Emissions Assessment Model (STEAM). Additionally, 1 h resolution data from 2003 to 2005 are utilized to investigate changes due to the SECA limits set in 2006. The observed SO2 concentrations on Utö have continuously decreased since 2003 due to an overall decrease in SO2 emissions in northern Europe, combined with reduced emissions from shipping traffic due to SECA regulations. The 3-year average SO2 concentration dropped from pre-SECA (2003–2005) to post-SECA (2007–2009, 2011–2013, 2016–2018) periods by 38 %, 39 %, and 67 %, respectively. No clear trends were observed in the concentrations of other measured pollutants. Furthermore, we investigated wind-direction-resolved SO2 concentrations for 2 selected years (2014 and 2019), and the results showed a significant decrease in high-SO2-concentration shipping plumes due to the implementation of SECA in 2015. Our study brings out the importance of long-term, high-time-resolution air quality observations at a remote marine research station by providing means for both quantitative and qualitative analyses of the impacts of regulatory environmental legislation."

Employing PRISM (Plume-Rise-Iterative-Stratified-Moist), a new method, we found that considering these effects significantly improves predictions of pollutant dispersion. This insight enhances our understanding of environmental impacts, enabling more accurate air quality modelling and fostering more effective pollution management strategies. 
 Plume rise plays a critical role in dispersing pollutants emitted from tall stacks, dictating the height reached by buoyant plumes and their subsequent downwind dispersion. Commonly, plume rise is assumed to be governed by atmospheric stability and by the exit momentum and temperature of the effluent released from large stacks. However, an under-recognized influence on plume rise is the effects of entrained and/or co-emitted water, which can change the plume height due to exchange of latent heat associated with phase changes in within-plume water. While many of the stack sources achieve high temperatures of the emitted effluent via combustion, the impact of combustion-generated water on plume rise is often overlooked in large-scale air quality models. As the rising water condenses or evaporates, it releases or absorbs latent heat, influencing the height reached by the plumes. Our study investigates the effects of latent heat exchange by combustion-generated and entrained water on plume rise. We introduce a novel approach that integrates moist thermodynamics into an empirical parameterization for plume rise, resulting in the development of PRISM (Plume-Rise-Iterative-Stratified-Moist). Long-term (6-month duration) simulations using PRISM exhibit a difference of up to ±100 % in surface concentrations of emitted pollutants near industrial sources compared to previous predictions, emphasizing the substantial influence of moist thermodynamics on plume rise. Our results show up to 50 % improvement in model-simulated plume height through evaluation vs. aircraft observations over the Canadian oil sands. This study pioneers a plume rise sub-grid parameterization integrating moist thermodynamics in iterative calculation of neutral buoyancy height for plumes emitted from industrial stacks, thereby advancing our understanding of plume behaviour and enhancing the accuracy of air quality modelling. These advancements can potentially contribute to more effective pollution control strategies."

Fluorescence spectroscopy analysis of aerosol samples from five regional sites (collected during the summer of 2021) identified oil sands operations as a measurable brown carbon source. Industrial aerosol emissions were unlikely to impact regional radiative forcing. These findings show that fluorescence spectroscopy can be used to monitor brown carbon in the AOSR. 
 Extensive industrial operations in the Athabasca oil sands region (AOSR) (Alberta, Canada) are a suspected source of water-soluble brown carbon  (WS-BrC), a class of light-absorbing organic aerosols capable of altering atmospheric solar-radiation budgets. However, the current understanding of  WS-BrC across the AOSR is limited, and the primary regional sources of these aerosols are unknown. During the summer of 2021, active filter-pack  samplers were deployed at five sites across the AOSR to collect total suspended particulate matter for the purpose of evaluating WS-BrC. Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy and fluorescence excitation–emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy, complemented by parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) modelling, were employed for sample characterization. Aerosol absorbance was comparable between near-industry and remote field sites, suggesting that industrial WS-BrC exerted limited influence on regional radiative forcing. The combined EEM–PARAFAC method identified three fluorescent components (fluorophores), including one humic-like substance (C1) and two protein-like substances (C2 and C3). Sites near oil sands facilities and sample exposures receiving atmospheric transport from local industry (as indicated by back-trajectory analysis) displayed increased C1 and C3 fluorescence; moreover, both fluorophores were positively correlated with particulate elements (i.e. vanadium and sulfur) and gaseous pollutants (i.e. nitrogen dioxide and total reduced sulfur), indicative of oil sands emissions. The C2 fluorophore exhibited high emission intensity at near-field sites and during severe wildfire smoke events, while positive correlations with industry indicator variables suggest that C2 likely reflected both wildfire-generated and anthropogenic WS-BrC. These results demonstrate that the combined EEM–PARAFAC method is an accessible and cost-effective tool that can be applied to monitor industrial WS-BrC in the AOSR."

Scott Evans;Quan Gan;William McClintock;Jerry Lumpe,Remote sensing of lower-middle-thermosphere temperatures using the N2 Lyman–Birge–Hopfield (LBH) bands,"Temperature is essential to understanding the thermosphere. Most temperature measurements have been indirect or had large uncertainties, especially in the lower-middle thermosphere, where data are rarely available. Since October 2018, NASA’s GOLD mission has produced disk images of neutral temperatures near 160 km at locations over the Americas and Atlantic Ocean. This paper discusses both temperature retrieval techniques and issues in interpreting GOLD’s images of thermospheric temperatures. 
 The scientific and societal importance of short-term changes in the thermosphere–ionosphere (T–I) system highlights a need to better understand short-term changes in the thermosphere. For collision avoidance, this need becomes increasingly important as the number of low-earth-orbiting satellites increases because geomagnetic activity can cause dramatic, unexpected increases in satellite drag. The thermospheric density changes responsible for changes in drag depend primarily on changes in the thermospheric temperature. However, for collision avoidance, the specification of drag could also be problematic during quiet periods when the number of satellites and the uncertainties in their orbits are large. While temperatures and densities at higher altitudes (≳250 km) have been extensively studied and modeled, there is a knowledge gap for densities at lower-middle-thermosphere altitudes (≲200 km). At these lower altitudes, the primary sources of thermospheric density data, in situ and drag data from satellites, are rarely available. Remote sensing of temperatures and composition by NASA's Global-scale Observations of the Limb and Disk (GOLD) mission can help fill this gap. The GOLD mission produces disk images of neutral temperature, a key parameter for understanding neutral density in the lower-middle thermosphere. However, while disk images of the temperature have been available since the launch of GOLD, recent improvements to its observational capability that are relevant to data interpretation may not be widely known. Also, other temperature retrieval techniques than GOLD's have been published. Comparisons indicate that GOLD's technique gives the most consistent results and yields the lowest uncertainties. This paper discusses both temperature retrieval techniques and issues in interpreting GOLD's images of temperatures."

Nelson;Hannakaisa Lindqvist,A global perspective on CO2 satellite observations in high AOD conditions,"We find that small particles suspended in the air (aerosols) affect the satellite observations of carbon dioxide (CO2) made by the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 satellite instrument. Satellite estimates of CO2 appear to be too high for clean areas and too low for polluted areas. Our results show that CO2 and aerosols are often co-emitted, and this is partly masked out in the current retrievals. Correctly accounting for the aerosol effect is important for CO2 emission estimates by satellites. 
 Satellite-based observations of carbon dioxide (CO2) are sensitive to all processes that affect the propagation of radiation in the atmosphere, including scattering and absorption by atmospheric aerosols. Therefore,  accurate retrievals of column-averaged CO2 (XCO2) benefit from detailed information on the aerosol conditions. This is particularly relevant for future missions focusing on observing anthropogenic CO2 emissions, such as the Copernicus Anthropogenic CO2 Monitoring mission (CO2M). To fully prepare for CO2M observations, it is informative to investigate existing observations in addition to other approaches. Our focus here is on observations from the NASA Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) mission. In the operational full-physics XCO2 retrieval used to generate OCO-2 level 2 products, the aerosol properties are known to have high uncertainty, but their main objective is to facilitate CO2 retrievals. We evaluate the OCO-2 product from the point of view of aerosols by comparing the OCO-2-retrieved aerosol properties to collocated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua Dark Target aerosol products. We find that there is a systematic difference between the aerosol optical depth (AOD, τ) values retrieved by the two instruments such that τOCO-2∼0.4τMODIS. A similar difference is found when comparing OCO-2 with the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET). This results in 16.5 % of cases being misclassified as low AOD (good quality) by the OCO-2 quality filtering. We also find a dependence of the XCO2 on the AOD difference, indicating an aerosol-induced effect in the XCO2 retrieval. Furthermore, comparing with the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON), we find a small AOD-dependent bias in XCO2. In addition, we find a weak but statistically significant correlation between MODIS AOD and XCO2, which can be partly explained by natural covariance and co-emission of aerosols and CO2. Due to the co-emission, using an AOD threshold in the quality filtering leads to a sampling bias, where high XCO2 values are more often removed. To mitigate the effect of this on the anthropogenic CO2 emission monitoring, we investigate the effect of the AOD threshold on the fraction of acceptable XCO2 data. We find that relaxing the MODIS AOD threshold from 0.2 to 0.5, which is the goal for the CO2M, increases the fraction of acceptable data by 14 percentage points globally and by 31 percentage points for urban areas."

 This article presents a simple method for determining greenhouse gases (CH4, CO2 and N2O) using an alternative new set-up of the chromatographic system. The novelty of the presented method is the application of a Carboxen 1010 PLOT capillary column for separation of trace gases – CH4, CO2 and N2O – from air samples and their detection using a barrier discharge ionisation detector (BID). Simultaneously, a parallel molecular sieve column RT-Msieve 5A connected to a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) allowed the determination of CH4, N2 and O2 concentrations from 0.2 % to 100 %. The system was equipped with an autosampler transferring the samples without air contamination thanks to a vacuum pump and inert gas flushing. Method validation was performed using commercial gas standards and comparative measurement of CO2, CH4 and N2O concentrations applying cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS). A 3 d continuous measurement series of greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in ambient air and tests of typical vial sample measurements with increased GHG concentrations were performed.The advantage of this method is that the system is easy to set up and allows for simultaneous detection and analysis of the main GHGs using one gas chromatography (GC) column and one detector, thereby omitting the need for an electron capture detector (ECD) containing radiogenic components for N2O analysis and a flame ionisation detector (FID) with a methaniser for low-concentration CO2 samples.

However, many atmospheric inverse models fail to adequately incorporate the spatial and temporal correlations inherent in satellite observations and often lack rigorous methods for estimating parameters like spatial length scales. We introduce an inference model that processes the spatiotemporal covariance in satellite data and estimates hyperparameters such as covariance length scales. Our approach uses the Gaussian process (GP) machine learning (ML) and modern probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) to perform atmospheric inversions of emissions from satellite data. We develop a GP ML inversion system based on modern PPLs and the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model, simulating atmospheric CO2 concentrations corresponding to the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2/3 (OCO-2/3) data for July 2020. In our supervised learning framework, we treat the GEOS-Chem simulated data set as the target, with predictors derived by scaling the target with sector-specific factors hidden from the GP machine. Our results show that the GP model, combined with GPU-enabled PPLs, effectively retrieves true emission scaling factors and infers noise levels concealed within the data. This suggests that our method could be applied over larger areas with more complex covariance structures, enabling comprehensive analysis of the spatiotemporal patterns observed in OCO-2/3 and similar satellite data sets."

However, the impact and its pathways remain poorly understood. This study investigates the contributions of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions from Lake Taihu to O3 formation in surrounding regions using a numerical approach. Composite analysis, case studies, and process analysis reveal that BVOC emissions from Lake Taihu increase hourly near‐surface O3 concentrations, with a maximum rise of 25.5 μg m−3, improving model performance. The influence of lake BVOC emissions is large on the northwest side of Lake Taihu, primarily determined by the spatial emission patterns and dominant wind fields. The development of the planetary boundary layer, particularly the thermal internal boundary layer, and the enhanced lake breeze play important roles in increasing near‐surface O3 levels over land, whereas variations in temperature play a minor role. Vertical cross‐sections show that interactions between land‐lake breezes and background wind fields are critical for O3 transport, increasing surface concentrations in surrounding areas. Additionally, lake BVOC emissions intensify both daytime and nighttime gas‐phase chemical formation of O3, consuming nitrates and producing additional O3 within the lower troposphere. This study highlights the importance of local thermal circulations and lake BVOC emissions in O3 pollution, emphasizing the need for comprehensive air pollution control strategies in lakeside cities."

This study compares the characteristics of TC precipitation over land and ocean in the Northern Hemisphere using satellite data from 2001 – 2020. An analog selection method is used to pair each landfalling TC case with an oceanic case of the same intensity and similar atmospheric environmental conditions. Here we show robust discrepancies in rainfall rate and pattern for TCs over land and ocean. The average rain rates of landfalling TCs are 27.8% lower than those of oceanic TCs. Nonetheless, the rainfall is more intense on the right side of landfalling TCs compared with oceanic TCs. This left-right difference pattern tends to be more pronounced for TCs with faster translation speeds. Numerical simulations indicate that the increased surface friction and moisture convergence are largely responsible for the increased rainfall rate on the right side of landfalling TCs."

 Wind-induced particulate matter (PM) resuspension is an increasingly recognized contributor to urban air pollution. A CFD model of 2D street canyon geometry was developed that can replicate the process of resuspension. Model created the wind speed vs concentration increase due to resuspension relationship and its key properties: threshold wind speed causing resuspension (TWSR) and concentration increase. At least 8.75 m/s in 10 m height inlet wind speed before street canyons was needed to start the resuspension, leading to PM10 concentrations often exceeding 1 μg/m³, with peak values reaching as high as 3 μg/m³. The model can predict the behavior of resuspension well, but it cannot capture all the factors acting in the real environment to match precisely the air quality data. Silt load remains the greatest unknown factor in determining the overall magnitude of resuspension, with observed increases in PM10 concentrations up to 6 μg/m³ in air quality data."

 Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in atmospheric PM significantly impacts climate and health. However, China's air pollution control on CDOM is unclear. To evaluate the effect of the Blue Sky Defense Battle (BSDB) on the pollution characteristics and sources of CDOM, we comprehensively analyzed 1,428 PM2.5 samples in Xi'an (2016-2022). Compared with the pre-BSDB period, we found a 17% increase in the air quality index and a 42% reduction in CDOM pollution levels. Furthermore, in winter, carbonaceous aerosol concentrations notably declined, with OC decreased by 25% and EC by 74%. Additionally, CDOM in Xi'an was predominantly composed of humic chromophores (80%), and the highly oxygenated humic-like substances (HO-HULIS) declined by 34%, effectively reducing the potential oxidative toxicity risks. Source apportionment results from the excitation-emission matrix fluorescence fingerprinting technique with the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) model demonstrated that the effective control of combustion sources was the main driver of changes in atmospheric concentrations, chemical composition, and optical properties. Based on the NMF model analysis of carbonaceous aerosol, the source contributions of atmospheric oxidation and photochemical reactions increased after the BSDB indicating the limited control of the secondary sources. Additionally, the ineffective control of dust sources and the increasing contribution of external transport to CDOM after the BSDB highlighted the importance of effective dust management and regional collaborative control. Despite the decline in PM2.5 levels, the rise in toxic components (HO-HULIS) indicated ongoing challenges for health-focused pollution control."

 The extensive daily statistics of aerosol properties, cloud properties, and their mutual correlations provide crucial information for better assessing future climate change. In this paper, 14 years (2010–2023) of data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are analyzed over the northern part of Arabian Sea (Latitude: 21°–25° N and Longitude: 62°–68° E) to assess the characteristics of aerosols and clouds and their relationships under different meteorological conditions. When aerosol optical depth (AOD) is less than ∼ 0.7, the observations exhibit a positive correlation between AOD and cloud droplet effective radius (CDR) but negative correlations between AOD and cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), between AOD and cloud optical depth (COD), between AOD and cloud liquid water path (CLWP), and between AOD and cloud geometrical thickness (H). The corresponding aerosol-cloud correlations change signs when the AOD values are larger than 0.7. However, the single folded positive AOD-cloud fraction (CF) relationship is observed in both AOD regimes. Similar correlations are also observed between precipitable water vapor (PWV) and CDR, CDNC, COD, H, CF and CLWP, together with a positive correlation between PWV and AOD. Further isolation of the environmental effects from aerosol effects by stratifying AOD and cloud data into different LTS and PWV bins shows that the signature of the well-known Twomey effect is observed under high LTS-high PWV conditions, while an opposite effect (anti-Twomey) is observed under low PWV conditions, regardless of LTS values. Additionally, negative correlations between AOD and COD, AOD and CLWP, and AOD and H are observed under low LTS, regardless of PWV conditions, with a slight positive correlation when AOD >0.4 under high LTS and PWV conditions."

 Low cloud exerts significant cooling effect on climate system. Nevertheless, the occurrence frequency of low clouds (OFLC) with height and its influential mechanism remain unclear, especially at the regional scale. In this study, high-vertical-resolution radiosonde measurements during the period 2018–2019 reveal that mean OFLC in eastern China (13.5 ± 6.4 %) is 21 % less than that in eastern United States (17.0 ± 4.5 %). Coincidentally, the regional distribution of aerosol optical depth (AOD) is opposite, with the mean AOD in eastern China being 150 % larger than that in eastern United States. In the meantime, the spatial pattern of surface relative humidity (RH) is similar to OFLC, with lower RH in eastern China than in eastern United States. The impacts of AOD and RH on the OFLC are explored. Results show that higher AOD usually increases the lower-tropospheric stability (LTS) and decreases the planetary boundary layer height (PBLH), while lower RH increases the lifting condensation level (LCL) for a given air temperature. Lower PBLH and higher LCL jointly decrease the difference between PBLH and LCL, which decrease the chances for the low cloud formation, resulting in lower OFLC in eastern China. The effect of AOD on OFLC depends on the RH conditions. When RH < 40 %, AOD has almost no effect on OFLC in both regions. When 40 % ≤ RH ≤ 70 %, OFLC tends to decrease as AOD increases in eastern United States, but no obvious OFLC trend exists in eastern China. While AOD exerts significantly negative roles on OFLC to different extent in the two regions when RH > 70 %. As AOD increases, the OFLC in eastern United States shows a significantly decreasing tends, with the correlation coefficient (R) being −0.90 between OFLC and AOD. Similarly, in eastern China, the OFLC decreases significantly when AOD > 0.4, with a R of −0.80. These results deepen our understanding of regional-scale impact mechanisms of the aerosol on low cloud's occurrence and help to reduce the uncertainties in simulating the height-resolved OFLC in predicting future climate change."

As indirect aerosol effects saturate with increasing injection rates, direct effects exceed indirect effects. This implies that marine cloud brightening is best implemented in areas with extensive cloud cover, while aerosol direct scattering effects remain dominant when clouds are scarce. 
 Marine cloud brightening (MCB) geoengineering aims to inject aerosols over oceans to brighten clouds and reflect more sunlight in order to offset the impacts of global warming or to achieve localized climate cooling. The relative contributions of direct and indirect effects in MCB implementations remain uncertain. Here, we quantify both effects by designing model simulations to simulate MCB for five open-ocean regions around the globe. Our results show that a uniform injection strategy that does not depend on wind speed captured the sensitive areas of the regions that produced the largest radiative perturbations during the implementation of MCB. When the injection amounts are low, the sea salt aerosol effect on shortwave radiation is dominated by the indirect effect via brightening clouds, showing obvious spatial heterogeneity. As the indirect effect of aerosols saturates with increasing injection rates, the direct effect increases linearly and exceeds the indirect effects, producing a consistent increase in the spatial distributions of top-of-atmosphere upward shortwave radiation. This study provides quantifiable radiation and cloud variability data for multiple regional MCB implementations and suggests that injection strategies can be optimized by adjusting injection amounts and selecting areas sensitive to injections."

By applying nonlinear regression and k-means cluster analysis to over 2 years of PRO and non-PRO data, this study shows how deviations from a refractivity model relate to vertical profiles of water vapor pressure (moisture) and that differences between components of PRO signals correlate directly with vertical profiles of water path (precipitation). 
 Polarimetric radio occultations (PROs) of the Global Navigation Satellite System are able to characterize precipitation structure and intensity. Prior studies have shown the relationship between precipitation and water vapor pressure columns, known as the “precipitation pickup.” Less is known about the relationship between the vertical distributions of temperature and moisture globally within precipitating scenes as measured from space. This work uses cluster analysis of PRO to explore how the vertical distributions of temperature and moisture – combined into PRO refractivity – relate to vertical distributions of precipitation and moisture variables. We evaluate the ability of k-means clustering to find relationships among PRO polarimetric phase difference, refractivity, liquid water path (LWP), ice water path (IWP), and water vapor pressure using over 2 years of data matched between the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission  and the radio occultations (ROs) and heavy precipitation (HP) demonstration mission on board the Spanish Paz spacecraft (ROHP-PAZ). A polytropic potential refractivity model for polytropic atmospheres is introduced to ascertain how different vertical thermodynamic profiles that can occur during different precipitation scenarios are related to changes in the polytropic index and thereby vertical heat transfer rates. The cluster analyses suggest a relationship between the amplitude and shape of deviations from the potential refractivity model and water vapor pressure. These analyses also confirm a positive correlation between vertical shapes of polarimetric phase difference and both LWP and IWP. For certain values, the coefficients of the polytropic potential refractivity model flag physical vs. nonphysical retrievals and indicate when a profile has little to no moisture. The study reveals a similar relationship between the clustering for these coefficients and different water vapor pressure profiles."

We found making accurate mixtures at very low levels challenging due to the gas sticking to cylinder walls. However, we successfully created stable mixtures at higher levels. These can be used as reliable standards for global air monitoring. More research is needed to develop methods for making accurate mixtures at lower levels. 
 Acetonitrile plays an important role in atmospheric processes and serves as a key tracer of biomass burning, the major emission source of primary carbonaceous particles and trace gases in the global atmosphere. Recognizing its significance, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) Programme has designated acetonitrile as one of the target volatile organic compounds for global atmospheric monitoring, aiming for data quality better than 20 % accuracy and 15 % precision. Meeting the objectives of the WMO GAW Programme requires accurate and stable calibration standards with expanded uncertainties of less than 5 %. In this study, we explored the feasibility of gravimetry for developing primary standard gas mixtures (PSMs) in three different types of aluminium cylinders, each with distinct internal surface treatments, at nmol mol−1 and µmol mol−1 levels with a relative expanded uncertainty of less than 5 % and nitrogen as the matrix gas. We found that all three types of cylinders were inadequate without further passivation for developing acetonitrile PSMs below 10 nmol mol−1 due to significant adsorption losses (6 %–49 %) onto the cylinder's inner surface. To overcome this challenge, we prepared acetonitrile gas mixtures at 100 nmol mol−1 using a modified gravimetric method and at 10 µmol mol−1 using a conventional gravimetric method and then evaluated their long-term stability. Results showed that the effect of the adsorption loss at 100 nmol mol−1 and 10 µmol mol−1 was negated and negligible, respectively. Stability results show that we can disseminate acetonitrile calibration standards at both 100 nmol mol−1 and 10 µmol mol−1 with a relative expanded uncertainty of 3 % and 1 %, respectively (with an expiration period of 3 years), meeting the target uncertainty of the WMO GAW Programme. Further research is still needed to develop accurate and stable acetonitrile calibration standards below 10 nmol mol−1 that are closer to atmospheric levels."

The evaluation results show that the CDR has long-term consistency and continuity, and is more accurate than other similar products in climate covariability, suggesting that the CDR is suitable for climate change research and for constraining climate model simulations. 
 We developed a climate data record (CDR) of atmospheric column water vapor (CWV) and sea surface temperature (SST) under oceanic rain-free conditions using over two decades of observational records from three satellite instruments: the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), the MicroWave Radiation Imager (MWRI), and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2 (AMSR2). The AMSR-E and AMSR2 satellites operated in near-stable orbits, while the MWRI experienced orbital drifts of nearly an hour during its operational period. The CWV and SST products were retrieved from well-recalibrated level-1 brightness temperatures observed by common channels with the same frequencies on these instruments, designed for measuring these properties. Adjustments for diurnal drifting errors caused by orbital drift were applied to MWRI data using a semi-physical model developed in previous studies. The combination of prior recalibration and diurnal drift adjustment ensured inter-satellite consistency in the CDRs. Compared to in-situ radiosonde and buoy observations, the biases and root mean square errors of the CDRs are within 0.1 mm and 4.4 mm for CWV, and 0.2 K and 1.6 K for SST, respectively. Long-term trends of the retrieved CWV and SST align with observations from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and the Global Tropical Moored Buoy Array (GTMBA) products. The global oceanic trends of CWV and SST were 0.39 mm decade-1 and 0.16 K decade-1, respectively, over the period 2002–2022. Inter-consistency between CWV and SST, as well as layer-mean temperatures derived from satellite microwave sounder observations, was examined and compared with climate model simulations from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). It was found that the trend ratio of the retrieved CWV to SST was 9.9 % K-1 in the tropics, which closely aligns with CMIP6 models. These validation results indicate that the presented CDR has high accuracy and is suitable for long-term climate change research.

Our results show that the trend of BVOCs emissions declining reversed in 1978 ± 1, with increases now being observed. Since this year, the average BVOCs emissions in Germany increased by ∼54%. Spatially, eastern-central Germany and urban areas exhibit the highest increase. Future projections indicate a continued increase in emissions over the coming decades.

Precipitation-induced fractionation between fossil fuel combustion-derived BC (BCff) and biomass burning-derived BC (BCbb) resulted in an increase of ffossil BC to 68 ± 7% during the wet monsoon season, which is significantly higher than levels measured at a background site in South Asia and in simultaneously collected precipitation samples.

10.1029/2024JD040905,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,该研究论文探讨了亚热带森林中马尾松叶片对NO和NO2的吸收情况，重点关注了森林冠层对氮氧化物的吸收作为去除土壤排放和大气氮氧化物的重要途径。研究结果表明，马尾松冠层对NO和NO2的总吸收量显著，其中NO2的贡献最大。虽然NO的沉降速度低于检测限，但NO2的沉降速度在一定范围内波动，并在夏季干旱期间观察到明显的NO2吸收。该研究还指出，在低NO2浓度下未检测到一致的NO2排放或吸收，表明需要受控环境来确定补偿点的存在。由于物种特异性的NO和NO2沉降速度以及东亚地区潜在的长期干旱，需要对其他亚热带树种进行更长期的叶片尺度NO和NO2交换监测，特别是在干旱期间，以精确地限制区域氮氧化物预算。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它涉及大气成分分析和空气质量监测，特别是关于氮氧化物的浓度和沉降过程。,"['NOx', 'NO2', 'Air Quality Monitoring', 'Atmospheric Composition Analysis', 'Nitrogen deposition']",Piaopiao Ke;Xiaodong Ge;Cheng Yu;Dongxing Yang;Ronghua Kang;Yongmei Huang;Lei Duan,Field Investigation of Leaf‐Level NO and NO2 Exchange Between Atmosphere and Mature Pinus massoniana in a Subtropical Forest,"Canopy uptake of NOx (NO and NO2) is an important pathway for removing soil‐emitted and atmospheric NOx, especially in forested areas. Deposition velocity of NO and NO2 varies among plant species and the existence of the compensation point, the concentration value when net exchange flux of NO or NO2 is zero, remains uncertain. Additionally, leaf‐level uptake of NO and NO2 in subtropical forests in China has received little attention despite this area suffering from heavy nitrogen pollution. To help address the knowledge gap, leaf‐level exchange of NO and NO2 between needles of mature Pinus massoniana and the atmosphere was monitored in situ in a subtropical forest in Southwest China. The results showed that the total uptake of NO and NO2 by the canopy reached 1.03 ± 0.31 kg N m−2 (Land) yr−1, of which 93.9% was contributed by NO2. The NO deposition velocity was below detection limit. For NO2 it ranged between 0.028 and 1.2 cm s−1. Distinct NO2 uptake was observed (0.035 cm s−1) during summer droughts when stomatal conductance was expected to be small. No consistent NO2 emissions or uptake were detected at low NO2 concentrations (<3 ppbv), indicating the need of controlled environments to conclusively determine the existence of a compensation point. Due to species‐specific NO and NO2 deposition velocities and potential prolonged drought in East Asia, more long‐term monitoring of leaf‐level NO and NO2 exchanges for other subtropical tree species, especially during droughts, is needed to precisely constrain the regional NOx budget."

 Accurate precipitable water vapor (PWV) monitoring is critical to understanding weather systems and predicting extreme meteorological events. The Moderate Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI) onboard the Fengyun-3A (FY-3A) satellite provides PWV products with a spatial resolution of 1 km × 1 km. However, the MERSI PWV products contain a large amount of gross errors due to the stripe noise in the raw MERSI observations. Furthermore, the accuracy of MERSI PWV is also affected by weather conditions and land cover types. To address these limitations, we first applied Gaussian spatial filtering to the MERSI observations to attenuate the stripe noise and generate de-striped observations. Then, the MNPNet (MERSI NIR PWV retrieval Net) was developed based on random forest for the first time to retrieve PWV from the combination of GNSS PWV and MERSI near-infrared (NIR) atmospheric transmittance. The new nets well considered land cover types and weather conditions, and obtained amazing accuracy. The PWV derived from 256 GNSS stations in 2017 is used as a reference to validate the MNPNet PWV. The results show that root mean square errors (RMS) of the new net are 1.95 mm for clear weather, 2.68 mm for uncertain weather, 3.07 mm for cloudy weather, and 2.85 mm for all weather, which indicates improvements of 74 %, 78 %, 87 %, and 85 % over the original FY-3A/MERSI PWV. The validation results verify that the proposed algorithm has excellent performance and can markedly improve the all-weather PWV retrieval from FY-3A/MERSI. This study is essential for improving the utilization of MERSI data, weather forecasting, and climate research."

 In this study, the thunderstorms (TS) cloud top height (CTH) data of the advanced geosynchronous radiation imager of the Fengyun-4 A (FY-4 A, a geostationary satellite) were quality-controlled using the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) data, and the lightning data of the LMI of the FY-4 A were processed by the cluster analysis method. The convective systems in China's land and adjacent sea areas were identified from the CTH data, and the CTH data of TS was corrected. The CTH and lightning activity characteristics of TS and overshooting convections (OC) and their relationship were analyzed. TS and OC occurred more often over land areas than over sea areas. The two had similar spatial distribution characteristics: they were mainly concentrated at low latitudes, and the CTH of both showed a noticeable decreasing trend with increasing latitude. Most TS had CAPE1/2 (updraft speed) values between 15 ms−1 and 50 ms−1 and CTH between 11 km and 17.5 km. Most OC had CAPE1/2 values between 20 ms−1 and 50 ms−1 and CTH between 15 km and 19 km.

 Diurnal cloud cycle (DCC) is closely related not only to the physical processes of cloud formation and development, but also to the different times of the day when clouds cause different radiative effects, which can significantly affect the Earth-atmosphere energy system and its hydrological cycle. Compared with the large number of model assessment studies on seasonal and interannual characteristics of clouds, fewer studies assessed DCC and its radiative effects. In this study, we select three characteristic parameters of DCC, namely mean cloud cover, amplitude and factor of centroid (F), and carry out a quantitative assessment of CMIP6 simulation results based on a systematic analysis of global DCC characteristics and Diurnal cloud cycle radiative effect (DCCRE) using the 2001–2014 ISCCP, CERES satellite observations and MERRA2 reanalysis. The main factors affecting DCCRE are also investigated. The results show that the models perform well in terms of daily mean cloud cover, but diurnal amplitude is smaller in some regions (e.g., the Southern Ocean); and there are large inter-model differences. However, limited comparative results between CMIP5 and CMIP6 indicate that the CMIP6 model makes a significant improvement in simulating the daily amplitude of cloud cover. We also find significant differences in daily phase of cloud amount between CMIP5&6 models and satellite results, namely the models are unable to accurately simulate the timing of daily cloud appearance, suggesting that the models do not represent cloud formation and maintenance mechanisms accurately. The satellite results show that the net radiative effects caused by DCC is mainly dominated by shortwave and that there are significant regional differences. The cloud daily amplitude shows a strong correlation with DCCRE globally, which is the main factor affecting DCCRE. In regions with significant daily variations in cloud cover, cloud daily fluctuations can induce radiative forcing of approximately ±15 W/m2 at TOA. However, the global distribution of simulated DCCRE of the CMIP6 models is significantly different from that of the satellite data, and the correlation between simulated DCCRE and amplitude is not exhibited in most regions, which is mainly due to the inaccuracy of the models in simulating cloud amplitude and phase, resulting in simulated radiative flux error."

Our study found aerosol hygroscopicity is higher in the SCS in summer than winter, with significant influences from various terrestrial air masses. Aerosol size distribution had a stronger effect on activation ratio than aerosol hygroscopicity in summer and vice versa in winter. Our study provides valuable information to enhance our understanding of cloud condensation nuclei activities in the SCS. 
 Understanding seasonal variations in cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity and the impact of anthropogenic emissions in marine environments is crucial for assessing climate change. This study presents findings from two shipborne observations conducted in the South China Sea (SCS) during the summer and winter of 2021. In summer, higher particle number concentrations but lower mass concentrations of non-refractory submicron particles (NR-PM1) were observed, driven by Aitken-mode particle dominance. In contrast, winter showed a more balanced distribution between Aitken and accumulation-mode particles. Summer particles were more hygroscopic, exhibiting higher activation ratios (ARs) at all supersaturation (SS) levels. Distinct air mass periods were identified: in summer, terrestrial air masses from Luzon (“Luzon” period) and the area formerly referred to as the Indochinese Peninsula (hereafter “Indochinese Peninsula” period) and marine air masses; in winter, periods were influenced by mainland China (hereafter “Mainland China” period), a mix of mainland China and marine air masses (“Mixed” period), and purely marine air masses. The Luzon period in summer exhibited the highest particle number concentration, especially in the Aitken mode, resulting in the highest CCN number concentration (NCCN). Aerosol hygroscopicity was higher during the Indochinese Peninsula period compared to the Luzon period, leading to a higher bulk AR due to the combination of higher hygroscopicity and a greater fraction of accumulation-mode particles. The Mainland China period in winter showed a high nitrate fraction in the NR-PM1, but the inorganic fraction was similar to it in the Luzon period, resulting in comparable hygroscopicity at low SS to the Luzon period. However, smaller particle hygroscopicity was significantly lower in the Mainland China period compared to summer. The Mixed period in winter exhibited a higher fraction of accumulation-mode particles, causing a higher bulk AR compared to the Mainland China period. Overall, summer terrestrial air masses increased the Aitken-mode particle and CCN concentration, while winter terrestrial air masses led to higher concentration of large particles and lower hygroscopicity of fine particles. CCN closure analysis, considering aerosol composition and mixing state, revealed that summer aerosols were primarily internally mixed, whereas smaller aerosols in winter were primarily externally mixed. The potential effect of undetected sea salt may lead to an underestimation of aerosol hygroscopicity in summer. This study highlights significant seasonal differences in aerosol properties and the impact of different types of terrestrial air masses on CCN activity in the SCS, contributing to our understanding of regional climate influences."

Meuser;Robin N. Thor;Irene C. Dedoussi,Multi-model assessment of the atmospheric and radiative effects of supersonic transport aircraft,"Civil supersonic aircraft may return in the near future, and their emissions could lead to atmospheric changes which are detrimental to public health and the climate. We use four atmospheric chemistry models and show that emissions from a future supersonic aircraft fleet increase stratospheric nitrogen and water vapor levels, while depleting the global ozone column and leading to increases in radiative forcing. Their impacts can be reduced by reducing NOx emissions or the cruise altitude. 
 Commercial supersonic aircraft may return in the near future, offering reduced travel time while flying higher in the atmosphere than subsonic aircraft, thus displacing part of the passenger traffic and associated emissions to higher altitudes. For the first time since 2007, we present a comprehensive multi-model assessment of the atmospheric and radiative effect of this displacement. We use four models (EMAC, GEOS-Chem, LMDz–INCA, and MOZART-3) to evaluate three scenarios in which subsonic aviation is partially replaced with supersonic aircraft. Replacing 4 % of subsonic traffic with Mach 2 aircraft that have a NOx emissions index of 13.8 g (NO2) kg−1 leads to ozone column loss of −0.3 % (−0.9 DU; model range from −0.4 % to −0.1 %), and it increases radiative forcing by 19.1 mW m−2 (model range from 16.7 to 28.1). This forcing is driven by water vapor (18.2 mW m−2), ozone (11.4 mW m−2), and aerosol emissions (−10.5 mW m−2). The use of a Mach 2 concept with low-NOx emissions (4.6 g (NO2) kg−1) reduces the effect on forcing and ozone to 13.4 mW m−2 (model range from 2.4 to 23.4) and −0.1 % (−0.3 DU; model range from −0.2 % to +0.0 %), respectively. If a Mach 1.6 aircraft with a lower cruise altitude and NOx emissions of 4.6 g (NO2) kg−1 is used instead, we find a near-net-zero effect on the ozone column and an increase in the radiative forcing of 3.7 mW m−2 (model range from 0.5 to 7.1). The supersonic concepts have up to 185 % greater radiative effect per passenger kilometer from non-CO2 emissions compared to subsonic aviation (excluding contrail impacts)."

Vertical changes in the concentrations, compositions, key drivers, and environmental impacts of VOCs were analyzed in this study. We find that VOC species display differentiated vertical variation patterns and distinct roles in contributing to photochemical ozone formation with increasing height in the urban planetary boundary layer. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play crucial roles in regulating the formation of tropospheric ozone. However, limited knowledge on the interactions between vertical VOC variations and photochemical ozone formation in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) has hindered effective ozone control strategies, especially in large cities. In this study, we investigated the vertical changes in concentrations, compositions, and key driving factors of a large suite of VOCs using online gradient measurements taken from a 325 m tall tower in urban Beijing. The impacts of these vertical VOC variations on photochemical ozone formation were also analyzed using box model simulations. Our results indicate that VOCs exhibited distinct vertical variation patterns due to their differences in sources and chemical reactivities, along with the diurnal evolution of the PBL. During daytime, reactive VOCs (e.g., hydrocarbons) are rapidly oxidized as they mix upward, accompanied by the formation and accumulation of oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) in the middle and upper layers. In addition, the photochemical formation of ozone responds positively to changes in both NOx and VOCs. As a result, the production rate of ozone declines with height due to the simultaneous decreases in concentrations of reactive VOCs and NOx but remains high in the middle and upper layers. The strong production of ozone aloft is primarily driven by the presence of high OVOC concentrations. Therefore, careful consideration should be given to the vertical variations in both photochemical ozone production rates and formation regimes in the whole PBL when developing regional ozone control strategies."

Thomas Arnold;Nandana Amarasinghe;Daniel Miller;Jennifer Small-Griswold;Mikael Witte;Brian Cairns;Siddhant Gupta;Greg McFarquhar;Joseph O'Brien,Evaluating spectral cloud effective radius retrievals from the Enhanced MODIS Airborne Simulator (eMAS) during ORACLES,"Satellite remote sensing retrievals of cloud droplet size are used to understand clouds and their interactions with aerosols and radiation but require many simplifying assumptions. Evaluation of these retrievals is typically done by comparing against direct measurements of droplets from airborne cloud probes. This paper details an evaluation of proxy airborne remote sensing droplet size retrievals against several cloud probes and explores the impact of key assumptions on retrieval agreement. 
 Satellite remote sensing retrievals of cloud effective radius (CER) are widely used for studies of aerosol–cloud interactions. Such retrievals, however, rely on forward radiative transfer (RT) calculations using simplified assumptions that can lead to retrieval errors when the real atmosphere deviates from the forward model. Here, coincident airborne remote sensing and in situ observations obtained during NASA's ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS (ORACLES) field campaign are used to evaluate retrievals of CER for marine boundary layer stratocumulus clouds and to explore impacts of forward RT model assumptions and other confounding factors. Specifically, spectral CER retrievals from the Enhanced MODIS Airborne Simulator (eMAS) and the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) are compared with polarimetric retrievals from RSP and with CER derived from droplet size distributions (DSDs) observed by the Phase Doppler Interferometer (PDI) and a combination of the Cloud and Aerosol Spectrometer (CAS) and the Two-Dimensional Stereo Probe (2D-S). The sensitivities of the eMAS and RSP spectral retrievals to assumptions about the DSD effective variance (CEV) and liquid water complex index of refraction are explored. CER and CEV inferred from eMAS spectral reflectance observations of the backscatter glory provide additional context for the spectral CER retrievals. The spectral and polarimetric CER retrieval agreement is case dependent, and updating the retrieval RT assumptions, including using RSP polarimetric CEV retrievals as a constraint, yields mixed results that are tied to differing sensitivities to vertical heterogeneity. Moreover, the in situ cloud probes, often used as the benchmark for remote sensing CER retrieval assessments, themselves do not agree, with PDI DSDs yielding CER values 1.3–1.6 µm larger than CAS and with CEV roughly 50 %–60 % smaller than CAS. Implications for the interpretation of spectral and polarimetric CER retrievals and their agreement are discussed."

The Heidelberg Radon Monitor (HRM) measures 214Polonium (Po), a progeny of Rn. This study presents Po-based Rn activity concentrations measured with the HRM at 8 stations in Germany with guidelines for estimating Rn from Po measurements. Comparison between modeled and measured activity concentrations show that at high relative humidity Po measurements cannot be interpreted as Rn. 
 Atmospheric measurements of the short-lived radioactive noble gas 222Radon (222Rn) have many applications. Its concentrations are driven by atmospheric mixing as well as seasonal variations, which follow the seasonality of 222Rn exhalation from continental soils with lower values during the wet winter and spring months compared to more dry summer conditions. Hence, it can be used as tracer to distinguish marine from continental air masses or for transport model validation. The Heidelberg Radon Monitor (HRM) is a static filter detector measuring atmospheric 214Polonium (214Po), which is a progeny of 222Rn. These measurements can be used to infer atmospheric 222Rn activity concentrations if the radioactive disequilibrium between 214Po and 222Rn at the measurement site is known. In this study, 214Po activity concentrations measured with the HRM at 8 stations in the ICOS Germany network are presented, along with guidelines for evaluating these data to estimate atmospheric 222Rn activity concentrations. In addition to the established line-loss and disequilibrium corrections applied when sampling through long tubing or from air intake heights close to the ground, respectively, an upper limit for relative humidity (RH) is suggested, where secular equilibrium can still be assumed. At higher RH, aerosol scavenging effects can cause disequilibrium between 214Po and 222Rn. Using comparison with the model this threshold is determined to be at about 98 % RH. A clear diurnal cycle of 222Rn is observed at all German tower stations during the summer and autumn months as well as seasonal cycle with maximum during summer and autumn months. Overall, our results demonstrate that the 214Po-based 222Rn measurements with the HRM are reliable if the equilibrium conditions between 214Po and 222Rn can be ensured, i.e. for air intake heights above 80–90 m a.g.l. at stations located in flat areas during conditions with RH < 98 %."

The results are as follows: the interannual trends of DSR and diffuse radiation fraction (DSRF) for all aerosol types in this study tend to coincide with the interannual trends of aerosol optical depth (AOD). Both AOD and solar zenith angle (SZA) are assessed to have higher feature significance for both DSR and DSRF during the period of the study, which indicates that AOD and SZA are important parameters affecting DSR and DSRF. The dust aerosols have a higher AOD (0.477), a higher scattering capacity (single scattering albedo (SSA) of 0.971) due to its components of mostly mineral sand and floating dust, and DSRF as high as 0.628 with an aerosol diffuse radiation effect (ADRE) of 194.942 W m−2. Comparing with dust aerosols, although the feature importance assessment values of SSA and angstrom exponent (AE) for DSR are more remarkable for biomass burning aerosols, the reduction in ADRE by 69.768 W m−2 may be attributed to the relatively larger effect of absorptive fine‐particle‐dominated aerosols on DSR.

The influence of aerosols on precipitation varies regionally due to many factors, including aerosol characteristics, precipitation types, and meteorological conditions. Using high‐resolution precipitation data from the hourly China merged precipitation analysis (CMPA) Version 1.0 and aerosol mixing ratio data from the Modern‐Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Application Version 2 (MERRA‐2) during the warm seasons of 2015–2020, this study employs sulfate mixing ratio (rsulfate ${r}_{\text{sulfate}}$) as a CCN proxy to investigate the distinct impacts of aerosols on warm‐topped and cold‐topped rainfall across the Sichuan Basin (SCB) and the North China Plain (NCP) regions in China. Our findings reveal that in SCB, aerosols suppress warm‐topped rain by stabilizing the atmosphere, reducing the cloud effective radius (re) and potentially weakening collision‐coalescence processes. Conversely, in cold‐topped rain events, aerosols initially enhance rainfall, but subsequently suppress it at higher concentrations. In NCP, suspended dust increases with rising rsulfate ${r}_{\text{sulfate}}$ acting as both giant cloud condensation (GCCNs) and ice nuclei (INs). This enhances cloud re and promotes rainfall across both cloud types. Furthermore, the aerosol radiative effect destabilizes the atmosphere, amplifying these processes. Despite variations in meteorological conditions, aerosols consistently exert a significant influence on rainfall. This research highlights the distinct aerosol impacts on rainfall in the two regions and underscores the need for further study to improve climate predictions."

Pierce,Look Within: Intraplume Differences on Smoke Aerosol Aging Driven by Concentration Gradients,"The evolution of organic aerosol (OA) composition and aerosol size distributions within smoke plumes are uncertain due to variability in the rates of OA evaporation/condensation and coagulation within a plume. It remains unclear how the evolution varies across different parts of individual plumes. We use a large eddy simulation model coupled with aerosol‐microphysics and radiation models to simulate the Williams Flats fire sampled during the Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality field campaign. At aircraft altitude, the model captures observed aerosol changes through 4 hr of aging. The model evolution of primary OA (POA), oxidized POA (OPOA), and secondary OA (SOA) shows that >90% of the SOA formation occurs before the first transect (∼40 min of aging). Lidar observations and the model show a significant amount of smoke in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and free troposphere (FT) with the model having equal amounts of smoke in the PBL and FT. Due to faster initial dilution, PBL concentrations are more than a factor of two lower than the FT concentrations, resulting in slower coagulational growth in the PBL. A 20 K temperature decrease with height in the PBL influences faster POA evaporation near the surface, while net OA evaporation in the FT is driven by continued dilution after the first aircraft transect. Net OA condensation in the PBL after the first transect is the result of areas with higher OH concentration leading to OPOA formation. Our results motivate the need for systematic observations of the vertical gradients of aerosol size and composition within smoke plumes."

 Surface ozone (O3) pollution affects air quality, human health, and the ecosystem. Understanding the complex non-linear relationship between ozone formation and its precursors, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is critical for policymakers to mitigate the pollution. The Empirical Kinetic Modeling Approach (EKMA) based on classical observation-constrained zero-dimension box model provides the sensitivity of ozone production to precursor concentrations instead of emissions. This makes the box-model EKMA hard to apply in a real emission reduction scenario. Here, we developed an alternative box model approach driven by localized emissions, which are derived from the field-observed concentrations. This model approach reproduced the O3 variations well by capturing the short-term changes of NOx and AVOCs emissions among different phases of pollution control during the 31st World University Games in Chengdu in 2023. The EKMA analysis based on this model approach showed a different O3 response to precursor reductions from the concentration-constrained approach, which overestimated the baseline of O3 concentration. The result from the EKMA analysis demonstrated that the O3 level was most sensitive to NOx due to stringent control strategies during the event and rapidly rebounded to almost VOC-limited regime after the event. The effects of VOCs reduction on O3 control examined by concentration-constrained model approach were less pronounced than those by emission-driven approach due to the lack of consideration of the emission-to-reaction process. Our findings suggest that the emission-driven box model is applicable for developing O3 control strategy in the local scale."

Heald,Nitrogen dominates global atmospheric organic aerosol absorption,"Atmospheric organic aerosols (OAs) influence Earth’s climate by absorbing sunlight. However, the link between their evolving composition and their absorptive effects is unclear. We demonstrate that brown nitrogen (BrN), the absorptive nitrogenous component of OAs, dominates their global absorption. Using a global model, we quantified BrN abundance, tracked its optical evolution with chemical aging, and assessed its radiative absorption. BrN contributes 76% of OAs’ surface light absorption over the US and 61% of their global absorptive optical depth. Moreover, the observed variability of OAs’ absorptive capacity is primarily driven by the sources and aging of BrN. BrN represents 18% of the global absorptive direct radiative effect of carbonaceous aerosols, with biomass burning being the largest contributor. Our research establishes a nitrogen-centric framework for attributing the climate impacts of OAs."
