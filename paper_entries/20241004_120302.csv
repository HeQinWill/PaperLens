10.1088/1748-9326/ad77b7,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇研究论文探讨了岛屿上入侵哺乳动物清除对气候的协同效益，并提出了一种可扩展的框架来监测恢复过程。研究利用卫星数据（例如树木覆盖度和NDVI）来评估入侵物种清除对岛屿森林面积、碳储量和植被生产力的影响。研究发现，入侵物种清除后，这些指标都呈现出显著的正向趋势，表明入侵物种清除对岛屿生态系统恢复具有积极意义。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它利用卫星观测数据来监测岛屿生态系统的变化，并评估入侵物种清除对气候变化的缓解作用。,"['satellite observations', 'tree cover', 'forest extent', 'forest carbon', 'vegetation productivity', 'Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)']",Miroslav Honzák;Geoffrey Roberts;Bradley J Cosentino;Joseph O Sexton;Harrison McKenzie-McHarg;John W Wilson;Min Feng;Alison Thieme;Neha Hunka;David J Will,Toward the quantification of the climate co-benefits of invasive mammal eradication on islands: a scalable framework for restoration monitoring,"Islands are hotspots of biological and cultural diversity that face growing threats from invasive species and climate change. Invasive mammal eradication on islands is a proven conservation intervention that prevents biodiversity loss and is a foundational activity for restoring degraded island-ocean ecosystems. However, these interventions are prioritized and evaluated primarily on biodiversity-based objectives despite growing evidence that invasive species removal may also serve as an effective nature-based solution to increase climate resilience of island-ocean ecosystems and contribute to climate change solution by protecting and restoring unique carbon stocks of native woody vegetation. To assess the effectiveness of interventions at the global scale, we developed a consistent and scalable framework for the long-term monitoring of tree cover, forest extent, forest carbon, and vegetation productivity in 1078 islands across 17 ecozones. Time-series of satellite-derived estimates of tree cover and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index over 36 yr (1984–2020) were used to establish annual baselines and changes in forest extent, carbon stocks, and vegetation productivity. The analysis revealed significant and sustained positive trends in all the indices on islands with eradication. The magnitude and potential biological relevance of these effects was highly variable across ecozones, but the overall sustained effects provide strong evidence of a positive ecosystem response to invasive mammal removal. We also found that, collectively, these islands sustain more than 940 000 ha of forest and 53 million MgC of forest carbon. This novel framework enables measuring the climate co-benefits of island restoration interventions in relevant policy terms using a low cost and globally consistent methodology that is applicable across the range of spatial and temporal scales pertinent to ecosystem recovery dynamics on islands."

However, in general, long-term hazard variation has not been incorporated into coastal risk assessments. There are coastal regions of high interest, such as urban areas, where a large number of people are exposed to hydrometeorological hazards, and ecosystems, which provide protection, where long-term natural variability should be considered a design factor. In this study, we systematized climate analysis to identify high-interest regions where hazard long-term variability should be considered in risk assessment, disaster reduction, and future climate change adaptation and protection designs. To achieve this goal, we examined the effect of the leading modes of climate variability (Arctic Oscillation, Southern Annular Mode, and El Niño–Southern Oscillation) on the variation in the recurrence of extreme coastal hazard events, including as a first step sea surface temperature, winds, and waves. Neglecting long-term variability could potentially lead to the underperformance of solutions, or even irreversible damage that compromises the conditions of ecosystems for which nature-based solutions are designed."

Predictions of future wildfire events, their extremity, and their impact on the environment and economy must account for the interactions between these drivers. Economic policy and land use decisions influence the susceptibility of an area to climate extremes, the probability of burning, and future decision making. To better understand how climate-driven drought events and adaptation efforts affect burned area, agricultural production losses, and land use decisions, we developed a storyline approach centered on Indonesia’s 2015 fire events, which saw significant (>5%) production losses of palm oil. We explored analogous events under three warming conditions and two storylines (multi-model ensemble mean climate change and high impact). We employed a model chain consisting of CMIP6 climate modeling to quantify climate change impacts, a wildfire climate impacts and adaptation model (FLAM) to predict burned areas, and the Global biosphere management model (GLOBIOM) to predict the resultant production losses and socio-economic consequences in the oil palm sector in Indonesia and, by extension, the EU. FLAM is a mechanistic, modular fire model used to reproduce and project wildfires based on various scenario criteria and input variables, whereas GLOBIOM is a global economic land use model, which assesses competition for land use and provides economic impacts based on scenario data. We found that total burned area and production loss can increase by up to 25% and lead to local price increases up to 70%, with only minor differences beyond 2.5 degrees of warming. Our results highlight the importance of considering the interactions of future warming, drought conditions, and extreme weather events when predicting their impacts on oil palm losses and burned area. This study sets the stage for further exploration on the impacts of land management policies on local and international environments and economies in the context of global warming."

Changing mountain headwaters, marked by reduced snowpacks, retreating glaciers, shifting precipitation patterns, and rising temperatures, pose a crucial question: what is the resilience of streamflow in these mountains, and what role does GW play in this resilience? This is particularly uncertain in tropical high mountains where the seasonality of precipitation and glacier melt govern streamflow generation. A glacio-hydrological model was created using the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling platform to investigate cryosphere-surface water–GW interactions in the Quilcayhuanca Basin, in Peru’s Cordillera Blanca. The model was forced by in-situ meteorological observations and parameterized using numerous data sources and process-based studies in the basin. Model results show that during the dry season, 37% of streamflow is generated from GW discharge, increasing to 56% during the lowest flows. Evapotranspiration is the largest mass flux from the basin at the peak of the dry season. Precipitation, temperature, and glacier change scenarios were used to assess the sensitivity of basin hydrology to climate change and glacier retreat. In a warmer, wetter, and nearly deglaciated future, Quilcayhuanca basin streamflow is expected to decrease by 4%–19% annually, with a larger volumetric change in overland and vadose zone flow than in GW flow. The range in values is more closely linked to uncertainty in precipitation change than temperature change. Despite a strong reduction in snow and ice contribution to streamflow with warming and deglaciation, the concomitant increase in precipitation can limit the changes in streamflow and GW flow, showcasing the resilience of the system to shifts in climate and glacier cover."

However, while efforts have focused on improving access and initial adoption, little attention has been given to social disparities in rates of adoption and the benefits derived from these technologies. Our study investigates the adoption of groundwater irrigation technology in India, a transformative innovation that has historically enhanced productivity and food security, and helped agricultural households adapt to a changing climate. We use a nationwide household survey sample that spans nearly a decade, capturing a key period of groundwater expansion in India. Our analysis reveals that members of highly marginalized social groups are less likely to adopt groundwater irrigation technologies, and less likely to sustain their use of the technologies for long periods of time. Furthermore, the household-level benefits of the technologies–operationalized through the relationship between technology adoption and income–appear lower for households belonging to historically marginalized groups compared to the historically advantaged. Our study underscores the importance of addressing social inequalities in both adoption as well as the sustained utilization of agricultural technologies and other climate adaptation tools. Disparities in the utilization of these technologies can hinder farmers’ ability to access new innovations and adapt to increasing threats from climate change. Targeted policies and interventions are essential to not only provide historically marginalized groups access to technological innovations, but also facilitate their effective utilization."

Its major rivers are subject to extensive water management (WM) activities in order to sustain multisectoral water demands, particularly during drought conditions. However, the impact of WM on the propagation dynamics and characteristics of hydrological drought (HD) in Texas remains unclear. To fill this gap, this study quantifies the influence of WM across 32 streamflow gauges along the mainstems of seven major rivers in Texas by comparing a variety of drought metrics under natural and managed conditions. Notably, we leveraged an extensive, naturalized streamflow dataset constructed by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, paired with gauge observations of managed conditions. Results indicate that at the multi-decadal scale, WM significantly reduced HD frequency across all seven rivers and at 81% of the gauges analyzed. Additionally, it increased the response timescale of HD across Texas’ major rivers by a median of 2.5 months. Conversely, the average-event duration and severity increased in most locations. Temporal analysis reveals that the WM impact on HD varied seasonally, with attenuation effects during mid-summer and early fall and intensification effects during late winter and spring. Additionally, WM was found to greatly increase the spatial variability of HD characteristics across the region. These findings emphasize the complexity of WM effects on HD and the necessity for nuanced strategies in managing HD under WM influences."

Extensive public and private funding has been used to establish ‘working forest’ conservation easements (WFCE) that aim to protect conservation values while maintaining commercial timber production. We use variation in the timing and location of easements to estimate the impacts of WFCEs in Maine from a 33-year time-series of forest loss and harvesting. We find that WFCEs had negligible impacts on an already low rate of forest loss. Compared to matched control areas, easements decreased forest loss by 0.0004% yr−1 (95% CI: −0.0008, to −0.00003%) the equivalent of 3.17 ha yr−1 (95% C.I.: 1.6, to 6.7 ha yr−1) when scaled to the 839 142 ha of total conserved area. In contrast, WFCEs increased the rate of harvesting by 0.37% yr−1 (95% CI: 0.11%–0.63%), or 3,105 ha yr−1 (95% C.I.: 923–5,287 ha yr−1) when scaled to the conserved area. However, more recently established easements contained stricter restrictions on harvest practices and stricter easements reduced harvest by 0.66% yr−1 (95% CI: −1.03, −0.29). Our results suggest that future easements could be more effective if they were targeted to higher risk of loss areas and included additional provisions for harvest restrictions and monitoring."

An automated content analysis of countries’ nationally determined contribution reports,"This study examines the extent to which national governments discuss the social determinants of planetary health equity (SDPHE) within their Nationally Determined Contribution reports (NDCs) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. This is assessed relative to the frequency of discussion of economic factors and health outcomes, and how this varies between countries based on political, economic, and environmental factors. Using natural language processing, a dictionary-based automated content analysis was conducted of the frequency of terms within these reports. Correlation analyses examined the relationship between the frequency of dictionary categories and political, economic, and environmental variables to ascertain the role of contextual factors. Overall, NDCs were found to feature a greater proportion of economic language compared to health outcome and SDPHE terms. Among the SDPHE, equity- and gender-related terms occurred most frequently. Correlations were identified primarily among high-income countries, that suggest moderate positive associations between levels of CO2 emissions per capita and per dollar of gross domestic product and the use of economic terms, and a negative association of economic language with levels of democracy. Democracy was also positively associated with language related to social norms such as equity and justice, indicating potential scope for impact through democratic pressures. The relatively frequent use of economic frames in NDCs suggests that economic issues may receive more attention compared to the SDPHE. This analysis identifies potential enabling and constraining country-level factors for greater attention to the SDPHE in NDCs and more progressive climate change mitigation policymaking."

In this study, we presented robust evidence linking the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) to the stilling over China between 1970 and 2010. Positive AMO phases trigger warming across the NH high-latitudes, weakening the large-scale meridional temperature gradient, and eventually leading to the reduction in NSWS in mid-latitude regions. We confirmed this effect through the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 Decadal Climate Prediction Project and historical simulations, which consistently reproduce the AMO’s impact on NSWS change over China. Additionally, large-ensemble simulations suggest that excluding the contribution of AMO reduces the uncertainty in NSWS trends from 1976 to 2005 by 19%. Our findings underscore the critical footprint of natural internal variability, particularly the AMO, in modulating regional NSWS and highlights its important role in the broader climate system."

The notion of ‘compound event’ encompasses not only co-occurring ECEs but also multiple ECEs across (different) growth stages (mECEs). The additional effects of these mECEs on crop yield, particularly considering various types of ECEs and regional scales, remain poorly understood. To close this knowledge gap, we consider droughts, pluvials, heatwaves, and coldwaves, and further identify which types of compound events have additional effects on winter wheat yield in France, using statistical methods and datasets encompassing 94 counties over a 68-year period. Our results indicate co-occurring drought heatwaves in summer and spring, along with co-occurring pluvial heatwaves and pluvial coldwaves in winter, have negative additional effects on yield compared with single ECEs. We further identify the types of mECEs that have intensified effects, with the majority showing negative effects on yield. Key interactions leading to intensified yield loss include droughts in winter or spring combined with summer co-occurring drought heatwaves, pluvials across multiple growth stages, pluvials combined with coldwaves, and the transition between droughts and pluvials, with the most severe anomaly attaining −17.2%. Coldwaves are the main ECE related to intensified yield increases, while their frequency is decreasing. Overall, this study stresses the interactions among ECEs on crop yield, and the identified types of mECEs could serve as foundational information for designing control experiments and improving process-based crop models."

In the last two decades alone, many applied studies have aimed at investigating the ‘value’ of socio-environmental outcomes from the perspectives of the general populations including Indigenous Peoples. The term ‘value’ is often invoked in varying contexts ranging from empirical research to natural resource management (NRM) strategies and policies. Underpinning all valuation exercises is a conceptual approach to defining and analysing value, which is contextual given that different philosophies and worldviews consider nature’s ‘value’ differently. Our objective was to understand value philosophies underpinning diverse NRM ‘value’ paradigms and to evaluate compatibility with Indigenous Peoples’ value attribution. We conducted a systematic search for publications on nature studies from multiple databases using a Boolean strategy. The processes for literature identification and selection are presented in a PRISMA flowchart. The study then critically reviewed and synthesized insights from the literature on the interpretations, conceptualizations, and elicitations of value, particularly in contexts where NRM influences Indigenous estates. We found that philosophical perspectives define how ‘value’ is conceptualised and evaluated. Most studies reviewed rested on the economic paradigm grounded in anthropocentric utilitarian value-framing, and limited studies considered a relational value lens that reflects Indigenous Peoples’ value attribution for the natural environment. A relational lens sits outside of the usual ‘instrumental versus intrinsic’ value dichotomy and deems human-nature connections coupled, and worthy in themselves. The paper demonstrates the commonalities and inconsistencies across diverse value conceptualizations and describes emerging pluralistic approaches consistent with Indigenous value attribution. A novel framework for understanding and bridging the different conceptual and analytical valuation lenses, particularly on water, is presented ensuring that multiple, complex, and distinct value dimensions are empirically bridged in studies involving Indigenous Peoples."

This program, mainly situated in arid and semi-arid regions, critically focuses on improving water use efficiency (WUE)—maximizing carbon sequestration per unit of water consumed—as a key strategy for optimizing water resource utilization and ensuring the long-term success of vegetation restoration efforts. However, the regulatory mechanisms of forest WUE in this region remain unclear. Here, we adopted an interpretative machine-learning method to investigate the influence of main environmental elements, topographical conditions, and stand characteristics on forest WUE in the TNSFP region from 2001 to 2022 based on remote sensing products, ground monitoring data, and forest inventory data. Our study identified soil moisture (SM) as the primary factor influencing forest WUE across the TNSFP region, with higher SM levels generally leading to improved WUE in forests. However, stand characteristics strongly mediated their relationship. Specifically, forest WUE initially increases against forest density before peaking at about 1000 trees hm−2 for needle-leaved forests (NLF) and 800 trees hm−2 for broad-leaved forests, respectively, then gradually declining due to water competition. When SM is relatively adequate, moderate thinning could significantly enhance forest WUE. Furthermore, implementing management strategies to improve WUE is crucial as NLFs mature. This study emphasizes the significant impacts of stand characteristics on forest WUE in the TNSFP region, offering essential insights for optimizing water resource management in managed forests across arid and semi-arid regions."

In this study, we constrain future projections of fHD (2070–2099) using observations of recent trends in temperature (T) and precipitation (P) (1980–2014) during the warm-seasons. The physical mechanism is that the variance of fHD across climate models is dominated by their projected changes in P (ΔP), which can be constrained by recent trends in T and P. Compared to the raw projections, the observationally constrained fHD is reduced by 9.68%–18.74%, with uncertainty narrowed by 3.79%–10.66% under the high emission scenario. The highest decline of fHD is located in regions with low population and gross domestic product (GDP), and globally, population and GDP exposures to fHD are reduced by 6.02%–10.73% and 6.51%–12.03%, respectively.

Addressing this challenge, our study demonstrated that, under S0-rich conditions and without organic additives, sulfidogenic communities dominated by sulfur-disproportionating bacteria (SDB) can effectively remove Hg(II) and prevent MeHg production. Using various inocula, we successfully established biological sulfidogenic systems driven separately by SDB and SRB. Batch experiments revealed that SDB cultures completely removed Hg(II) from the solution as HgS. Remarkably, no MeHg production was observed in the SDB cultures, while an average concentration of 0.32 μg/L of MeHg was detected in the SRB cultures. The absence of MeHg production in the SDB cultures could be mainly attributed to the cultivation conditions that reshaped the microbial community, resulting in a rapid decline of SRB-dominated Hg-methylating microorganisms. Consequently, the average abundance of the hgcA gene was 28 times lower than the levels before cultivation. Additionally, we found that the enriched Dissulfurimicrobium sp. bin121 can produce biogenic sulfide through sulfur disproportionation but lacks the hgcA gene, rendering it incapable of methylating Hg.

Here, we developed an adverse biological outcome screening strategy based on nontargeted functional protein profiles in earthworm (Eisenia fetida) immune cells exposed to NSMoS2 and their ionic counterpart (Na2MoO4). Through this framework, the apoptosis-related processes with distinct mechanisms were rapidly identified and thoroughly validated phenotypically. Specifically, upon exposure to 50 μg Mo/mL Na2MoO4, cellular signaling and energy homeostasis were disrupted within the transcription–translation biological chain. The autophagic pathway was activated, which, together with energy deprivation, phenotypically induced significant autophagy that ultimately led to apoptosis. In contrast, NSMoS2, tested at the same concentration, caused a reprogramming of apoptotic gene and protein expressions. Transcriptome plasticity facilitated the endocytic-adaptive transcriptional profile characterized by cytoskeleton remodeling and lysosome organization/movement under NSMoS2 exposure.

We analyzed the extracts of passive air samplers deployed at 119 unique sites in Southern Canada between 2019 and 2022 for 353 organic vapors. Hierarchical clustering of the obtained data set revealed four archetypes of spatial concentration variability in the outdoor atmosphere, which are indicative of common sources and similar atmospheric dispersion behavior. “Point Source” signatures are characterized by elevated concentration in the vicinity of major release locations. A “Population” signature applies to compounds whose air concentrations are highly correlated with population density, and is associated with emissions from consumer products. The “Water Source” signature applies to substances with elevated levels in the vicinity of water bodies from which they evaporate. Another group of compounds displays a “Uniform” signature, indicative of a lack of major sources within the study area. We illustrate how such a data set, and the derived spatial patterns, can be applied to support the identification of sources, the quantification of atmospheric emissions, the modeling of air quality, and the investigation of potential inequities in inhalation exposure."

An epidemiologic survey was conducted involving 318 community residents in Shanghai, China, to assess PFAS exposure levels. The relationship between PFAS exposure and five thyroid function indicators was analyzed using Bayesian Kernel Regression (BKMR) and Weighted Quantile Sum Regression (WQS). Ten effector genes related to PFAS and thyroid diseases were identified through the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) for bioinformatics analysis and pathways involved were explored through mediation analysis. In vivo validation of these effector genes was conducted using PCR, complemented by in vitro cellular experiments involving transcriptome sequencing and the construction of animal models to simulate mixed PFAS exposure in the general population. Mixed PFAS exposure was found to impact thyroid health primarily through pathways related to lipid metabolism in toxicogenomic studies and resulted in the upregulation of key genes associated with lipid metabolism in animal models.

Herein, we enhanced the mass transfer and the utilization of hydrogen reagent through construction of a two-phase flow-through membrane reaction device (Pd/SiC-MR). Pd/SiC-MR displays high efficiency and selectivity toward removal of multiple pollutants. For instance, rapid (∼0.35 s) and exclusive hydrogenation (>99%) of carbon-chlorine bond in organohalogens were realized at high water flux (220 L/m2/h). More importantly, the two-phase Pd/SiC-MR reaction system achieved 31.4% utilization of hydrogen reagent, 1–3 orders of magnitude higher than those by classical slurry or fixed-bed reactor. The high hydrogenation performance is attributed to the close proximity of the hydrogen source, reactive hydrogen atom, and pollutant under high molecular collision frequency in membrane pores. Our study opens an approach for improved hydrogen reagent utilization while reserving the high pollutant removal efficiency through altering operating conditions, beyond complex material design limitations in hydrogenation water purification."

Here, we investigated these mechanisms with Comamonas testosteroniKF-1, a wastewater isolate, by combining microscopy, spectroscopy, proteomics, protein modeling, and genetic engineering. Compared to minor dents on PET films, scanning electron microscopy revealed significant fragmentation of PET pellets, resulting in a 3.5-fold increase in the abundance of small nanoparticles (<100 nm) during 30-day cultivation. Infrared spectroscopy captured primarily hydrolytic cleavage in the fragmented pellet particles. Solution analysis further demonstrated double hydrolysis of a PET oligomer, bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate, to the bioavailable monomer terephthalate. Supplementation with acetate, a common wastewater co-substrate, promoted cell growth and PET fragmentation. Of the multiple hydrolases encoded in the genome, intracellular proteomics detected only one, which was found in both acetate-only and PET-only conditions. Homology modeling of this hydrolase structure illustrated substrate binding analogous to reported PET hydrolases, despite dissimilar sequences. Mutants lacking this hydrolase gene were incapable of PET oligomer hydrolysis and had a 21% decrease in PET fragmentation; re-insertion of the gene restored both functions. Thus, we have identified constitutive production of a key PET-degrading hydrolase in wastewater Comamonas, which could be exploited for plastic bioconversion."

Solar-powered submersible water pumping systems are versatile technology that help address community drinking water, irrigation, and electricity needs. Stakeholders external to the community, particularly solar photovoltaic experts, are vital in ensuring continued system services; however, there has been no comprehensive assessment of different solar-powered water pumping system support efforts. This review is the first to systematically evaluate external support for solar-powered systems from multiple regions and implementing organizations. We reviewed solar-powered water pumping system literature to identify implemented external support and factors that affect implementation. Publication databases, organization Web sites, and citations were searched. Seventy-four studies were included and evaluated using inductive coding and thematic synthesis. We derived a framework that organized support activities and factors into three nested levels of implementation: system, program, and sector. For support efforts implemented after 2010, most support providers worked at all levels. Each provider type worked at levels aligned with their knowledge and resources and complementary to other providers’ work. Drivers of support specific to solar-powered water systems were the existence of solar photovoltaic markets and infrastructure, support providers experienced with solar photovoltaics, and government and community solar advocates. We grouped support factors that study authors associated with system functionality into four categories: location and quality of support, reliability of support arrangements, frequency and timeliness of support, and policy and regulatory environment. No study outlined support for multiple uses of the systems or end-of-lifecycle care of solar panels. Solar-powered water pumping systems provide multiple community services, and their management will be bolstered by support providers collaborating to optimally apply their skill sets and create support plans that comprehensively address system versatility."

Molecular initiating events (MIEs) describe biological outcomes resulting from chemical interactions with biomolecules. Machine learning models based on MIEs can predict complex toxic end points due to chemical exposure and improve the interpretability of models. In this study, a system was constructed that integrated six MIEs associated with adipogenesis and obesity. This system showed high accuracy in external validation, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.78. Molecular hydrophobicity (SlogP_VSA) and direct electrostatic interactions (PEOE_VSA) were identified as the two most critical molecular descriptors representing the obesogenic potential of chemicals. This system was further used to predict the obesogenic effects of chemicals on the candidate list of substances of very high concern (SVHCs). Results from 3T3-L1 adipogenesis assays verified that the system correctly predicted obesogenic or nonobesogenic effects of 10 of the 12 SVHCs tested, and identified four novel potential obesogens, including 2-benzotriazol-2-yl-4,6-ditert-butylphenol (UV-320), 4-(1,1,5-trimethylhexyl)phenol (p262-NP), 2-[4-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phenoxy]ethanol (OP1EO) and endosulfan.

Developing catalysts simultaneously with excellent water resistance and a high intermediate suppression ability is still a great challenge. Herein, we proposed a simple strategy to synthesize a Pd/CoOOH catalyst that contains abundant hydroxyl groups and lattice oxygen species, over which a negligible effect was observed on CH3OH conversion with 3 vol % water vapor, while a remarkable conversion reduction of 24% was observed over Pd/Co3O4. Moreover, the low-temperature CO2 selectivity over Pd/CoOOH is significantly enhanced in comparison with Pd/Co(OH)2. The high concentration of surface hydroxyl groups on Pd/CoOOH enhances the water resistance owing to the accelerated activation of H2O to generate Co–OH, which replaces the consumed hydroxyl and facilitates the quick dissociation of surface H2O through timely desorption. Additionally, the presence of Pd–Olatt–Co promotes electron transport from Co to Pd, leading to improved metal–support interactions and weakened metal–O bonds. This in turn enhances the catalyst’s capacity to efficaciously convert intermediates. This study sheds new insights into designing multifunctional catalytic platforms for efficient industrial OVOC purification as well as other heterogeneous oxidation reactions."

The organic compounds studied include cyclic alkanes of increasing size (amylcyclohexane, hexylcyclohexane, nonylcyclohexane, and decylcyclohexane) and aromatic compounds (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, 1,3,5-triethylbenzene and 1,3,5-tritert-butylbenzene). A considerable amount of SOA was formed from all examined compounds. For the studied cyclohexanes (C11–C16) there appears that the SOA yield depends nonlinearly on the length of their substitute chain. The large cyclohexanes had higher yields than the aromatic compounds, but the aromatic precursors produced a more oxidized SOA. This was due to the production of lower volatility and O:C first generation products by the cyclohexanes. Most oxidation products (with C* < 104 μg m–3) in the case of cyclohexanes are SVOCs (∼50%), while of aromatics are IVOCs (∼60%). Structure, molecular size, and length of the substitute chain of the parent hydrocarbon were found to play key roles in SOA formation, oxidation state, and volatility. The SOA volatility distribution, effective vaporization enthalpy, and effective accommodation coefficient were also quantified by combining SOA yields, thermodenuder (TD) and isothermal dilution measurements.

A dipolar mode with a notable meridional contrast between the equatorial and northern NIO is revealed by the second mode of Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis with a sharp rise over the Arabian Sea (AS) and Bay of Bengal (BoB) since 2002. Our results show that the aerosol dipolar variation is primarily modulated by an El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) during 1983–2001 (ID1) and by a warm phase of Atlantic Multi‐decadal Oscillation (AMO) during 2002–2020 (ID2), leading to a dry‐and‐warming condition spanning the coasts of East Africa, the Arabian Peninsula (AP), and South Asia (SA) that favors increasing aerosol emission and a longer life cycle in the upstream regions. A warm phase of the AMO tends to excite an anomalous cyclone in western Siberia and reinforces anticyclonic circulation in the Tibetan Plateau. Correlation analyses between the second EOF mode time series and other parameters in ID1 and ID2 show that an interannual dry‐and‐warming condition over the AP–SA is associated with a noticeable north‐south contrast of convection between the equatorial NIO and AP–SA in ID1. But in ID2, a zonal contrast of anomalous convective activities between the AP–SA and the BoB‐South China Sea is dominant, partially due to the warming AMO, which aids the development of anticyclonic cells over the TP and the strengthened subtropical westerly jet streams."

The measured LDRs of smoke in previous studies are highly variable and different from each other. Existing research on smoke aerosols considers only the internal mixing state of the black carbon (BC) particle population either by ignoring the externally mixed organic carbon (OC) particle population or by evaluating the LDR of smoke aerosols using the results of individual particles rather than the particle population. The field‐measured LDR of smoke then becomes difficult to interpret properly. The recent prescribed forest burning experiment in China showed that the LDR of freshly emitted smoke varies between 0.0% and 20.1% in wavelength (λ) of 532 nm. Electron microscopy images also showed that coated BC and pure OC exist simultaneously in biomass burning aerosols. Therefore, this study evaluates the influence of various parameters on the LDR of smoke by considering the internal and external mixing states. The calculated LDRs of the smoke aerosols were found to vary between 0.0% and 28.2% when λ is equal to 532 nm. The calculation results indicate that the LDR of smoke is slightly influenced by BC, considerably affected by the externally mixed OC, and is essentially dominated by the latter's morphology and particle size distribution. High levels and rapid changes of LDR of smoke can be well explained by nonsphericity and particle size distribution of externally mixed OC. This study advances the research on the measurement and evaluation of the LDR of smoke aerosols."

Although previous studies have explored the broad impacts of urbanization on TCs, the effect of heterogeneity caused by local intra‐urban variability has not been examined. To address this gap, this study utilized the urban Local Climate Zone (LCZ) to capture the urban landscape heterogeneity and the impacts of this representation on the simulation of the post‐landfall TCs characteristics in Houston. Taking the case of two recent TCs: Hurricane Harvey (occurred in 2017) and Tropical Storm Imelda (occurred in 2019), the study evaluated the impact of urban heterogeneity on 10‐m winds, 2‐m temperature, land surface temperature, and precipitation across Houston. The consideration of intra‐urban heterogeneity using LCZ can improve the 10‐m winds, 2‐m temperature, and spatial pattern of land surface temperature. Although the cumulative rainfall remained largely similar within the experiments (with and without LCZ), incorporating intra‐urban heterogeneity notably modified the spatial structure of urban rainfall, particularly in simulating heavy rainfall hot spots. These findings are consistent for both TCs and demonstrate the positive impact of incorporating intra‐urban heterogeneity on the landfalling TC simulations over the Houston area."

Constrained by the computational capabilities of the time, the CHAP program relied on numerous assumptions, which have been scrutinized in recent years. In addition to the CHAP method, in 2016, Friedman et al. proposed the idea of constructing a NEMP program based on the Particle‐in‐Cell (PIC) method. The PIC method not only accurately simulates the dynamics of electrons but also self‐consistently simulates the influence of pulsed electromagnetic fields on electrons, and requires fewer assumptions. Unfortunately, due to the excessively computational consuming of the PIC method, Friedman et al. couldn't simulate the full‐scale NEMP spanning tens of kilometers. In this paper, we present the first full‐scale simulation program for the NEMP based on the PIC‐fluid coupling method. By utilizing the moving window method, double‐grid methods and linked list storage techniques, we significantly reduce the computational consuming.

 In mice, intestinal tuft cells have been described as a long-lived, postmitotic cell type. Two distinct subsets have been identified: tuft-1 and tuft-2 (ref. 1). By combining analysis of primary human intestinal resection material and intestinal organoids, we identify four distinct human tuft cell states, two of which overlap with their murine counterparts. We show that tuft cell development depends on the presence of Wnt ligands, and that tuft cell numbers rapidly increase on interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13 exposure, as reported previously in mice2–4. This occurs through proliferation of pre-existing tuft cells, rather than through increased de novo generation from stem cells. Indeed, proliferative tuft cells occur in vivo both in fetal and in adult human intestine. Single mature proliferating tuft cells can form organoids that contain all intestinal epithelial cell types. Unlike stem and progenitor cells, human tuft cells survive irradiation damage and retain the ability to generate all other epithelial cell types. Accordingly, organoids engineered to lack tuft cells fail to recover from radiation-induced damage. Thus, tuft cells represent a damage-induced reserve intestinal stem cell pool in humans. Four distinct tuft cell states are identified by combining analysis of primary human intestinal resection material and organoids, and studying tuft cell development shows that they represent a damage-induced reserve intestinal stem cell pool in humans."

 To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the Paris Agreement committed countries to pursue efforts to limit global warming to 1.5 °C by urgently reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, the Paris temperature ambitions and remaining carbon budgets mostly use models that lack feedback among fire, vegetation and carbon, which are essential for understanding the future resilience of ecosystems. Here we use a coupled fire–vegetation model to explore regional impacts and feedbacks across global warming levels. We address whether the 1.5 °C goal is consistent with avoiding significant ecosystem changes when considering shifts in fire regimes. We find that the global warming level at which fire began to impact global carbon storage significantly was 1.07 °C (0.8–1.34 °C) above pre-industrial levels and conclude that fire is already playing a major role in decreasing the effectiveness of land carbon sinks. We estimate that considering fire reduces the remaining carbon budget by 25 Gt CO2 (~5%) for limiting temperature rise to 1.5 °C and 64 GtCO2 (~5%) for 2.0 °C compared to previous estimates. Whereas limiting warming to 1.5 °C is still essential for avoiding the worst impacts of climate change, in many cases, we are already reaching the point of significant change in ecosystems rich in carbon and biodiversity. Only about 1.07 °C of climate warming above the pre-industrial level is required for fire to substantially diminish the effectiveness of global carbon sinks, suggesting that climate change has already been weakening carbon storage through fire, according to integrated model simulations that consider the interaction between fire and vegetation."

 The limited efficacy of cancer immunotherapy occurs due to the lack of spatiotemporal orchestration of adaptive immune response stimulation and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment modulation. Herein, we report a nanoplatform fabricated using a pH-sensitive triblock copolymer synthesized by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization enabling in situ tumor vaccination and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization. The nanocarrier itself can induce melanoma immunogenic cell death (ICD) via tertiary amines and thioethers concentrating on mitochondria to regulate metabolism in triggering endoplasmic reticulum stress and upregulating gasdermin D for pyroptosis as well as some features of ferroptosis and apoptosis. After the addition of ligand cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (cRGD) and mannose, the mixed nanocarrier with immune adjuvant resiquimod encapsulation can target B16F10 cells for in situ tumor vaccination and TAMs for M1 phenotype polarization. In vivo studies indicate that the mixed targeting nanoplatform elicits tumor ICD, dendritic cell maturation, TAM polarization, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration and inhibits melanoma volume growth. In combination with immune checkpoint blockade, the survival time of mice is markedly prolonged. This study provides a strategy for utilizing immunoactive materials in the innate and adaptive immune responses to augment cancer therapy.

 Exotic quantum phases, arising from a complex interplay of charge, spin, lattice and orbital degrees of freedom, are of immense interest to a wide research community. A well-known example of such an entangled behavior is the Jahn-Teller effect, where the lifting of orbital degeneracy proceeds through lattice distortions. Here we demonstrate that a highly-symmetrical 5d1 double perovskite Ba2MgReO6, comprising a 3D array of isolated ReO6 octahedra, represents a rare example of a dynamic Jahn-Teller system in the strong spin-orbit coupling regime. Thermodynamic and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering experiments, supported by quantum chemistry calculations, undoubtedly show that the Jahn-Teller instability leads to a ground-state doublet, resolving a long-standing puzzle in this family of compounds. The dynamic state of ReO6 octahedra persists down to the lowest temperatures, where a multipolar order sets in, allowing for investigations of the interplay between a dynamic JT effect and strongly correlated electron behavior.

Notably, treatment with senolytics, drugs that remove senescent cells, reversed pain symptoms in mice post-injury.

Human and murine PTCL-NOSSMARCB1- show similar DNA methylation profiles, with hypermethylation of T-cell-related genes and hypomethylation of genes involved in myeloid development. Single-cell analyses of human and murine tumors revealed a rich and complex network of interactions between tumor cells and an immunosuppressive and exhausted tumor microenvironment (TME). In a drug screen, we identified histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) as a class of drugs effective against PTCL-NOSSmarcb1-.

Here, the authors show that chronic stress induces a disruption of excitation-inhibition balance in mouse MPOA, leading to depression-like states. 
 Dysregulation of brain homeostasis is associated with neuropsychiatric conditions such as major depressive disorder. However, underlying neural-circuit mechanisms remain not well-understood. We show in mice that chronic restraint stress (CRS) and social defeat stress (SDS) are both associated with disruption of excitation (E)-inhibition (I) balance, with increased E/I ratios, in medial preoptic area (MPOA) circuits, but through affecting different neuronal types. CRS results in elevated activity in glutamatergic neurons, and their suppression mitigates CRS-induced depressive-like behaviors. Paraventricular hypothalamic input to these neurons contributes to induction but not expression of depressive-like behaviors. Their projections to ventral tegmental area and periaqueductal gray/dorsal raphe suppress midbrain dopaminergic and serotonergic activity, respectively, and mediate expression of divergent depressive-like symptoms. By contrast, SDS results in reduced activity of GABAergic neurons, and their activation alleviates SDS-induced depressive-like behaviors. Thus, E/I imbalance with relatively increased excitation in MPOA circuits may be a general mechanism underlying depression caused by different etiological factors. Whether excitatory and inhibitory neural populations in the medial preoptic area of hypothalamus (MPOA) respond differentially under different chronic stress conditions is not fully understood. Here, the authors show that chronic stress induces a disruption of excitation-inhibition balance in mouse MPOA, leading to depression-like states."

 Rapid warming in the Arctic threatens to amplify climate change by releasing the region’s vast stocks of soil carbon to the atmosphere. Increased nutrient availability may exacerbate soil carbon losses by stimulating microbial decomposition or offset them by increasing primary productivity. The outcome of these competing feedbacks remains unclear. Here we present results from a long-term nutrient addition experiment in northern Alaska, United States, coupled with a mechanistic isotope-tracing experiment. We found that soil carbon losses observed during the first 20 years of fertilization were caused by microbial priming and were completely reversed in the subsequent 15 years by shrub expansion which promoted an increasingly efficient carbon–nitrogen economy. Incorporating long-term stoichiometric responses in Earth system models will improve predictions of the magnitude, direction and timing of the Arctic carbon–climate feedback.

 Anthropogenic activities have impacted marine ecosystems at extraordinary scales. Biogenic reef ecosystems built by the European flat oyster (Ostrea edulis) typically declined before scientific monitoring. The past form and extent of these habitats thus remains unknown, with such information potentially providing valuable perspectives for current management and policy. Collating >1,600 records published over 350 years, we created a map of historical oyster reef presence at the resolution of 10 km2 across its biogeographic range, including documenting abundant reef habitats along the coasts of France, Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Spatial extent data were available from just 26% of locations yet totalled >1.7 million hectares (median reef size = 29.9 ha, range 0.01–1,536,000 ha), with 190 associated macrofauna species from 13 phyla described. Our analysis demonstrates that oyster reefs were once a dominant three-dimensional feature of European coastlines, with their loss pointing to a fundamental restructuring and ‘flattening’ of coastal and shallow-shelf seafloors. This unique empirical record demonstrates the highly degraded nature of European seas and provides key baseline context for international restoration commitments.

 Current climate models suggested that Antarctic sea ice cover would decrease substantially under cumulative CO2 emission, but little is known whether large decrease in Antarctic sea ice can influence the occurrence of strong El Niño. Using time slice coupled and uncoupled model experiments, we show that in response to half reduction of Antarctic sea ice projected near the end of the 21st century, the frequency of strong El Niño would be increased by ~40%. It is contributed by enhanced thermocline, Ekman, and zonal advective positive feedbacks that are partly offset by enhanced thermodynamic damping. The strong warming and weakened westerly winds in the southeastern Pacific generate an anomalous Rossby wave propagating into the eastern subtropical and tropical Pacific, favoring stronger El Nino, and air-sea coupling and ocean feedbacks play a critical role in the teleconnection. Unexpectedly, compare to halved Antarctic sea ice, the ice-free Antarctic leads to a decrease in the frequency of strong El Niño, which is largely due to a substantial increase in thermodynamic damping. We also show that a large portion of the increase of strong El Niño events under greenhouse warming might be connected with Antarctic sea-ice loss, though increased greenhouse gas plays an important role."

 The occurrence of extreme hot and dry summer conditions in the Pacific Northwest region of North America (PNW) has been known to be influenced by climate modes of variability such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation and other variations in tropospheric circulation such as stationary waves and blocking. However, the extent to which the subseasonal remote tropical driver influences summer heat extremes and fire weather conditions across the PNW remains elusive. Our investigation reveals that the occurrence of heat extremes and associated fire-conducive weather conditions in the PNW is significantly heightened during the boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation (BSISO) phases 6-7, by ~50–120% relative to the seasonal probability. The promotion of these heat extremes is primarily attributed to the enhanced diabatic heating over the tropical central-to-eastern North Pacific, which generates a wave train traveling downstream toward North America, resulting in a prominent high-pressure system over the PNW. The ridge, subsequently, promotes surface warming over the region primarily through increased surface radiative heating and enhanced adiabatic warming. The results suggest a potential pathway to improving subseasonal-to-seasonal predictions of heatwaves and wildfire risks in the PNW by improving the representation of BSISO heating over the tropical-to-eastern North Pacific."

 Malaria is one of the major health threats in Africa, and the risk of transmission is projected to be exacerbated by global warming. Rwanda experienced an 11-fold increase in malaria incidence from 2011 to 2015 despite extensive funding and implementation of control measures. Here, we focus on Rwanda as a case study and simulate monthly malaria incidence between 2010 and 2015, employing an ensemble learning method. Next, we project future malaria prevalence using shared socio-economic pathways (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). We find that the projected increases in temperature and precipitation may shift malaria transmission risk to the highlands of western and northern Rwanda. These two regions that currently experience low malaria transmission. The seasonal effects of malaria incidence may be less apparent from January to June, and the peak season for malaria transmission in the highlands could occur one month earlier. Our findings highlight the impacts of climate change on malaria epidemics in Rwanda, which have implications for other world regions.

 After the middle Miocene Climate transition, global cooling caused substantial hydrological changes in East Asia. Today, many lines of evidence indicate that inland East Asia experienced persistent aridification after the middle Miocene Climate transition. However, chemical weathering records from the South China Sea as well as late-Miocene paleolake expansions in northeastern Tibet contrast with the idea of long-term aridification after the middle Miocene Climate transition. Here, we present manganese-to-iron ratios and clay mineral contents of sediments formed approximately 14 to 10 million years ago from the Guide Basin, northeastern Tibetan Plateau, combined with previously published records (lithology, magnetic susceptibility, redness, and strontium content). Our results show that a paleolake in the Guide Basin expanded between approximately 11.4 and 10.5 million years ago, opposite to the long-term drying trend after the middle Miocene Climate transition. On the 100-kilo-year eccentricity scale, our results demonstrate alternating moisture source variability in northeast Tibet, with precipitation predominantly delivered via the westerlies and the East Asian summer monsoon. This variability could potentially be related to the movement of the westerly jet over the Tibetan Plateau. After comparison to climate model simulations, we attribute this movement to astronomical forcing and the waxing and waning of the Antarctic ice sheet.

 Transforming the agri-food system from a “take-make-waste”, or linear production system, to a circular bioeconomy that reduces, recycles, recovers, reuses, and regenerates wastes and transitions from fossil to biobased fuels and products is being hailed as critical for meeting a growing population’s food and fuel needs in environmentally sustainable ways. While a transformation towards a circular bioeconomy is an appealing strategy to achieve multiple environmental goals, we argue that this strategy needs to go beyond a techno-centric focus and adopt an economic value-based lens to balance the desire for circularity with its costs, benefits, and distributional effects on society. This perspective analyzes the mechanisms that sustain the existing linear economy and proposes a novel social cost-benefit framework to determine the optimal level and path to circularity. We present five critical pathways to achieve a sustainable circular bioeconomy in a market economy consisting of decentralized decision-makers.

The expanded index is analyzed to reveal relationships between Arctic air temperatures/pressures and the probability of severe winter weather across the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes. Here we find a direct and quasilinear relationship between anomalously high Arctic temperatures/pressures and increased severe winter weather, especially in northeastern continental regions downstream of maximum regional Arctic warming. Positive temperature trends in the Arctic are associated with positive trends in severe winter weather across the continents in mid- to late-winter, coinciding with an increase in stratospheric polar vortex disruptions.

We analyzed the response of irrigated areas to drought conditions in areas equipped for irrigation and used the derived relationships to estimate annual irrigated areas for 32 European countries in the period 1990–2020. Interannual variability of irrigated areas varied notably, particularly in more humid Northern and Western Europe. In most humid regions, irrigated area is larger in dry years, whereas in more arid regions like Spain, it is larger in wet years. The largest irrigated area across Europe occurred in dry years 2003 and 2018 (11.93 and 11.77 million hectares), while the smallest is estimated for the wet years 2002 and 2014 (10.71 and 10.31 million hectares).

 Marine heatwaves are events of extreme warming in the ocean and have devastating consequences for marine life. Here we used a K-mean clustering analysis to detect different types of marine heatwaves along the South American coast from 10°S to 45°S and identify their remote drivers. In the central part of the domain, marine heatwaves are associated with atmospheric blocking caused by wave trains triggered by the Madden-Julian Oscillation. On the other hand, marine heatwaves occurring along the northern and southern coast of South America are associated with El Niño and La Niña events, respectively. The intensity and duration of these marine heatwaves are modulated by the development phase and intensity of the Niño and Niña events. By identifying the climatic modes of variability leading to each type of marine heatwaves, our study can help develop adaptation strategies, such as early warning systems, to prevent the devastating effects of marine heatwaves.

 The Nadir Crater offshore West Africa is a recently proposed near K-Pg impact structure identified on 2D seismic. Here we present 3D seismic data that image this crater in exceptional detail, unique for any such structure, which demonstrates beyond reasonable doubt that the crater-forming mechanism was a hypervelocity impact. Seismic mapping reveals a near-circular crater rim of 9.2 km and an outer brim of ~23 km diameter defined by concentric normal faults. An extended damage zone is evident across the region, well beyond the perceived limit of subsurface deformation for impact craters, except in a ‘sheltered zone’ to the east. The paleo-seabed shows evidence for widespread liquefaction because of seismic shaking, and scars and gullies formed by tsunami wave propagation and resurge. Deformation within the ~425 m high stratigraphic uplift and annular moat allows us to reconstruct the evolution of the crater, with radial thrusts at the periphery of the uplift suggesting a low-angle impact from the east. Structural relationships are used to reconstruct the deformation processes during the crater modification stage, with the central uplift forming first, followed by centripetal flow of surrounding sediments into the evacuated crater floor in the seconds to minutes after impact. A 9.2 km diameter rim, concentric normal faults and an extended damage zone are observed in 3-dimensional seismic reflection data from the Nadir crater offshore Western Africa and provide strong evidence for an impact origin."

 Abiotic synthesis of methanethiol through CO2 reduction is a presumptive initiation reaction of protometabolism in primordial ocean hydrothermal systems. However, reported artificial means of methanethiol production indicate the necessity of gas-phase condition, rather than aqueous-phase setting, for this prebiotic reaction to occur. Here we show that, under supercritical CO2 with a geochemically feasible concentration of hydrogen, up to 7.9% conversion of hydrogen sulfide to methanethiol is attained through a 14-day reaction at 200 °C on molybdenum sulfide catalyst deposited in a carbonate-NaCl solution. On the present ocean floor, discharges of liquid/supercritical CO2 occasionally occur in close vicinity to hydrothermal vents. Geological records of ancient seafloor suggest prevalence of such CO2 fluxes associated with hydrothermal activities. Our experimental results link these facts with the protometabolism scenario, leading to the possibility that the generation and transportation of methanethiol through the subseafloor CO2 fluxes constituted the beginning step of protometabolism in primordial ocean hydrothermal systems. Thus, the supply of supercritical-CO2-derived materials likely assisted the chemical evolution of life in combination with the known geochemical processes at the vent-ocean interface.

 Phenolic compounds (PC) are important secondary metabolites in plants, playing a crucial role in plant defense mechanisms against pathogens and other plants. Monitoring PC levels is important for understanding tree stress and implementing effective breeding programs. However, traditional methods for monitoring PC are time-consuming, prone to altering the phenolic composition, and mostly applicable only on a small scale. In this study, we evaluated the performance of Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAV) multispectral imaging in estimating the canopy phenolic content in slash pine over an 11-month period in 2021 and a seven-month period in 2022. Three machine learning models including Partial least squares regression (PLSR), Random forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were compared to determine the optimal predictive model for canopy PC. The RF model provided the best predictive results, with R2 values of 0.82 for the validation set and 0.94 for the calibration set. Additionally, the study assesses the heritable variation in canopy PC over time, with the monthly heritability (h2) of PC ranging from 0 to 0.26 in 2021 and from 0 to 0.35 in 2022; The highest h2 levels were observed in July and September 2021and July 2022. The findings demonstrate significant genetic control over the variation of PC. Furthermore, we observed higher breeding values and genetic gains in July and November, which further supports the strong correlation between PC and environmental factors such as temperature and light intensity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to employ time-series UAV multispectral imaging to predict secondary metabolites in pine trees and estimate their genetic variation over time. As a proof of concept, these findings provide more reliable information for tree breeding programs, ultimately enhancing their overall performance."

 Sea spray emission is the largest mass flux of aerosols to the atmosphere with important impact on atmospheric radiative transfer. However, large uncertainties still exit in constraining this mass flux and its climate forcing, in particular in the Arctic, where sea ice and relatively low wind speed in summer constitute a significantly different regime compared to the global ocean. Sea state conditions and marine boundary layer stability are also critical variables, but their contribution is often overlooked. Here we present concurrent observations of sea state using a novel stereo camera system, of sea spray through coarse mode aerosols, and of meteorological variables to determine boundary layer stability in the Barents and Kara Seas during the 2021 Arctic Century Expedition. Our findings reveal that aerosol concentrations were highest over open waters, closely correlating with wave height, followed by wind speed, wave steepness, and wave age. Notably, these correlations were stronger under unstable marine boundary layer conditions, reflecting immediate sea spray generation. By analysing various combinations of sea and atmospheric variables, we identified the wave height Reynolds number as the most effective indicator of atmospheric sea spray concentration, explaining 57% of its variability in unstable conditions.

Aerosol concentrations exhibit distinct seasonal patterns, with higher 7Be concentrations in summer and lower in winter, while 137Cs, 40K, 210Pb, PM10 and PM2.5 showed almost the opposite trends. Different statistical techniques, including Pearson's correlation analysis, multiple regression analysis (MRA), and canonical correlation analysis (CCA), were employed to elucidate the intricate relationships between aerosol concentrations, MLH, and meteorological parameters. The MRA identified a significant correlation between aerosol variability and specific predictors, while the CCA highlighted the differential influence of MLH and meteorological parameters on aerosol concentrations. The analysis revealed that temperature, MLH, and relative humidity are the primary factors influencing aerosol concentrations, underscoring their pivotal role in environmental dynamics."

The response maps onto the Arctic Oscillation and is strongest in the North Atlantic, where it resembles the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Unexpectedly, these 1-year lagged teleconnections are at least as strong as the better-known simultaneous winter connections. However, the 1-year lagged response is oppositein sign to the simultaneous response such that 1 year later, El Niño is followed by a positive NAO, whereas La Niña is followed by a negative NAO. The lagged response may also interfere with simultaneous ENSO teleconnections. We show here that these effects are unlikely to be caused by residual aliasing of ENSO cycles; rather, slowly migrating atmospheric angular momentum anomalies explain both the sign and the timing of the extratropical response. Our results have implications for understanding ENSO teleconnections, explaining observed extratropical climate variability and interpreting seasonal to interannual climate predictions."

Although the TFs specifying the blastocyst’s lineages are well characterized, those playing earlier roles remain poorly defined. Using mouse models of the TFNr5a2, we show thatNr5a2−/−embryos arrest at the early morula stage and exhibit altered lineage specification, frequent mitotic failure, and substantial chromosome segregation defects. Although NR5A2 plays a minor but measurable role during zygotic genome activation, it predominantly acts as a master regulator at the eight-cell stage, controlling expression of lineage-specifying TFs and genes involved in mitosis, telomere maintenance, and DNA repair.

We present direct evidence that grain rotation occurs through the motion of disconnections (line defects with step and dislocation character) along grain boundaries in platinum thin films. State-of-the-art in situ four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) observations reveal the statistical correlation between grain rotation and grain growth or shrinkage.

We synthesized bivalent molecules that link ligands of the transcription factor B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) to inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). These molecules relocalized CDK9 to BCL6-bound DNA and directed phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II. The resulting expression of pro-apoptotic, BCL6-target genes caused killing of diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells and specific ablation of the BCL6-regulated germinal center response. Genomics and proteomics corroborated a gain-of-function mechanism in which global kinase activity was not inhibited but rather redirected. Thus, kinase inhibitors can be used to context-specifically activate transcription."

We measured the fitness effects of ~100 insertion mutations in 42 strains ofSaccharomyces cerevisiaein six laboratory environments and found that the global epistasis scaling is nearly invariant across environments. Instead, the environment tunes one global parameter, the background fitness at which most mutations switch sign. As a consequence, the distribution of mutational effects is predictable across genotypes and environments.

We designed probes targeting >2000 gene regions to generate a dated evolutionary tree for 475 fungi and combined it with a similarly generated tree for 276 ants. We found that fungus-ant agriculture originated ~66 million years ago when the end-of-Cretaceous asteroid impact temporarily interrupted photosynthesis, causing global mass extinctions but favoring the proliferation of fungi. Subsequently, ~27 million years ago, one ancestral fungal cultivar population became domesticated, i.e., obligately mutualistic, when seasonally dry habitats expanded in South America, likely isolating the cultivar population from its free-living, wet forest–dwelling conspecifics. By revealing these and other major transitions in fungus-ant coevolution, our results clarify the historical processes that shaped a model system for nonhuman agriculture."

Today’s challenges are to bring benefit to greater numbers of patients of diverse ethnicities, target more cancer types, and achieve a cure while incurring fewer adverse events. In meeting those challenges, specific benefits may be offered by γδ T cells, which compose a second T cell lineage with distinct recognition capabilities and functional traits that bridge innate and adaptive immunity. γδ T cell–based clinical trials, including off-the-shelf adoptive cell therapy and agonist antibodies, are yielding promising results, although identifiable problems remain.
