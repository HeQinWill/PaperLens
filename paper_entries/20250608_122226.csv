We use global reanalysis data to provide evidence that the oscillation period is primarily modulated by seasonal variations in small-scale atmospheric wave activity. The findings have implications for seasonal and climate predictions. 
 The tropical stratosphere is characterized by a periodic oscillation of wind direction between westerly and easterly, known as the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), which modulates middle atmospheric circulations and surface climate on interannual timescales. The oscillation period fluctuates irregularly, ranging from 20 to 35 months. The causes of this fluctuation have long been hypothesized but lack observational evidence. This study shows that the period fluctuation is primarily driven by variability in small-scale wave (gravity wave) activity with an additional contribution from variability in tropical upwelling. Using an atmospheric reanalysis dataset, we capture temporal variations in small-scale wave activity that are coherent with the varying speed of the oscillation. This wave activity variation stems from the seasonality of tropical convection and tropopause layer wind, revealing their fundamental role in modulating the quasi-biennial period. Our findings suggest that better representing these multiscale interactions in models can enhance the accuracy of seasonal forecasts and the reliability of future climate projections."

Prisle;Bryan R. Bzdek,"Partitioning of ionic surfactants in aerosol droplets containing glutaric acid, sodium chloride, or sea salts","We measure the surface tension of picoliter-volume droplets containing strong ionic surfactants and cosolutes and compare this to surface tension predictions using two independent surfactant partitioning models. Under high-water-activity conditions, experimental measurements and model predictions show no change when NaCl cosolute is replaced with sea salt. Model predictions show that total surfactant concentrations in the range of tens to hundreds of millimolar are required to lower the surface tension of accumulation-mode aerosol. 
 Sea spray is the largest contributor to atmospheric aerosol by mass and contains mixtures of inorganic salts and organics. The chemically complex organic fraction can contain soluble, highly surface-active organics, and field studies commonly identify ionic surfactants in aerosol samples. In macroscopic solutions, divalent cations present in sea spray can alter the partitioning of ionic surfactants. Furthermore, the high surface area-to-volume (SA / V) ratio of aerosol droplets may lead to depletion of surfactant from the bulk, requiring more surfactant, relative to its volume, to lower the surface tension of a droplet compared to a macroscopic solution. Here, we investigate the partitioning of model ionic surfactants (sodium dodecyl sulfate, an anionic surfactant, and cetrimonium bromide, a cationic surfactant) in 6–10 µm radius droplets containing glutaric acid, NaCl, or sea spray mimic cosolutes. Surface tension measurements are compared to two independent partitioning models accounting for the SA / V ratio of the droplets. Salting out of the ionic surfactants leads to strong bulk depletion in 6–10 µm radius droplets, with no observable difference in droplet surface tension between NaCl and sea spray mimic cosolutes. The total ionic surfactant concentration required to reach the minimum surface tension for these droplets was 2.0 ± 0.5 mM, consistent with previous observations in droplets containing strong surfactants. Modeling results suggest that surfactant concentrations on the order of tens to hundreds of millimolar are required to significantly reduce surface tension in 100 nm droplets. These results have implications for cloud droplet activation and chemistry occurring at the interface of sea spray aerosol."

We developed a new method to create long-term cloud radiative kernels to improve the accuracy of measurements of sunlight reaching the surface, which significantly reduces errors. Findings suggest that prior estimates of cloud cooling effects may have been overstated, emphasizing the need for better strategies to manage climate change impacts in the Arctic. 
 The surface shortwave cloud radiative effect (CRE) plays a critical role in modulating the Earth's energy balance and climate change. However, accurately quantifying the CRE remains challenging due to significant uncertainties in downwelling surface shortwave radiation (DSSR) and cloud parameter estimates, especially in the Arctic. This paper introduces a novel approach that enhances the accuracy of CRE estimation by constructing computationally efficient, long-term gridded surface cloud fraction radiative kernels (GCF-CRKs) and integrating refined DSSR estimates and a high-precision cloud fraction (CF). By leveraging the correlation between the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) shortwave radiative parameters and surface radiation, combined with high-precision fused CF datasets from multiple satellite sources, we construct a CF-dependent model to refine DSSR estimates. Based on this model, we construct GCF-CRKs using the CF as the sole perturbation parameter to isolate the CF CRE. Our results indicate that this method significantly improves the accuracy of DSSR estimation under partially cloudy conditions (0 % < CF < 100 %), aligning more closely with ground-based observations. In Arctic-wide validation experiments, the root mean square error (RMSE) was decreased by approximately 2.5 W m−2, and the bias was reduced by 1.23 W m−2, which was an improvement of 8.7 % (reduction in RMSE) against the CERES EBAF (Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System Energy Balanced and Filled). Even greater improvements were achieved at stations in Greenland (RMSE was reduced by 4.53 W m−2, and bias was reduced by ∼ 6.89 W m−2, with an accuracy improvement of about 11.1 %). The GCF-CRKs exhibit similar signs and patterns and enhanced stability compared to existing kernels. The sensitivity analysis results reveal that seasonal and interannual variations introduce GCF-CRK uncertainties of approximately 1 and 0.1 W m−2 %−1, respectively, while spatial variations within the same latitude range can cause CRK uncertainties of 0.2–1.2 W m−2 %−1. These uncertainties can result in CRE biases ranging from 5 to 50 W m−2, which demonstrates the limitations of existing methods that utilize short-term, small-area parameter data to produce global CRKs. Using these GCF-CRKs, we estimated the spatiotemporal properties of the surface shortwave CRE in the Arctic over a 21-year period (2000–2020), and the trend result indicates that, despite the increasing influence of the CF on the Arctic DSSR, the smaller magnitude and interannual trend of the annual average surface shortwave CRE suggest that previous studies may have overestimated the magnitude and rate of the cooling effect of clouds on the Arctic DSSR by up to 4 and 0.5 W m−2 per decade, particularly in Greenland. This study provides a more accurate and efficient assessment of the CRE, and the results underscore the need for more effective measures to mitigate the impact of Arctic amplification on the surface radiative energy balance, which is crucial for understanding and addressing regional and global climate change.

Here, we present the data, covering over 60 years of daily observations conducted along the eastern Atlantic coast, spanning from the tropics to the northern extratropics. 
 Tropospheric ozone (O3) plays a key role in the climate system. Studying pre-industrial tropospheric O3 implies two important challenges: (i) the lack of observational records prior to the late 19th century, which hampers the understanding of long-term climate trends (given the crucial role of O3), and (ii) and the uncertainties in quantitative tropospheric O3 values in a non-polluted atmosphere across the planet. The ozonoscope was the first instrument used to measure ozone. It offered semi-quantitative estimates of surface O3 when no other measurements were available. Despite their potential value, the digitization, curation, and publication of ozonoscope data remain largely unexplored. In this work, we initiate an effort to rescue surface O3 ozonoscope records by compiling them in a new data collection. We include data from 23 observatories covering Portugal and the African Atlantic regions, providing a latitudinal span from the extratropics in the Northern Hemisphere to the tropics in the Southern Hemisphere. This record represents the most extensive ozonoscope data series to date, spanning 50 years of daily data and 58 years of monthly data, from 1855 to 1913.

Testing both traditional and more recent convolutional neural networks (deep learning), we find that relatively small deep networks performed best, particularly for uncommon classes, because they extract richer features. Our results indicate that such compact models are sufficient for classifying small grayscale plankton images. 
 Plankton imaging devices produce vast datasets, the processing of which can be largely accelerated through machine learning. This is a challenging task due to the diversity of plankton, the prevalence of non-biological classes, and the rarity of many classes. Most existing studies rely on small, unpublished datasets that often lack realism in size, class diversity and proportions. We therefore also lack a systematic, realistic benchmark of plankton image classification approaches. To address this gap, we leverage both existing and newly published, large, and realistic plankton imaging datasets from widely used instruments. We evaluate different classification approaches: a classical Random Forest classifier applied to handcrafted features, various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and a combination of both. This work aims to provide reference datasets, baseline results, and insights to guide future endeavors in plankton image classification. Overall, CNN outperformed the classical approach but only significantly for uncommon classes. Larger CNN, which should provide richer features, did not perform better than small ones; and features of small ones could even be further compressed without affecting classification performance. Finally, we highlight that the nature of the classifier is of little importance compared to the content of the features. Our findings suggest that small CNNs are sufficient to extract relevant information to classify small grayscale plankton images. This has consequences for operational classification models, which can afford to be small and quick. On the other hand, this opens the possibility for further development of the imaging systems to provide larger and richer images."

In this study, we used 238U, 235U, and 232Th decay series to investigate U and radiogenic lead (Pb*) behavior within individual U-phosphate minerals in a wetland affected by past U-mining activities. Three groups of U-phosphates were identified using SEM-EDXS based on their U, Ca, and P contents: ningyoite-like minerals (CaUIV(PO4)2·2H2O), near-ideal Ca-autunites (Ca(UVIO2)2(PO4)2·11H2O), and Ca-depleted autunite/chernikovite-like minerals ((H3O)(UVIO2)(PO4)·3H2O). NanoSIMS analysis of (230Th/238U) activity ratios revealed substantial U losses from the ningyoite-like minerals, particularly those located in the upstream vadose zone of the wetland, likely due to their oxidative dissolution under hydrological fluctuations. In contrast, the Ca-autunites and Ca-depleted autunite/chernikovite-like minerals exhibited (230Th/238U) signatures indicative of U accumulation. This behavior, more pronounced in the vadose zone, was interpreted as various stages of dissolution–precipitation that may have occurred upon early weathering of the U-ore and/or in the wetland. Finally, 206Pb*/238U ratios and Pb zoning within the U-grains revealed Pb losses, likely due to Pb diffusion in the mineral structure. Overall, this study demonstrates the relevance of NanoSIMS to investigate U and Pb mobility within microsized U-bearing minerals in contaminated environments."

Metal-stably bonded conductive network carbon composites show great potential, while their acquisition is costly and energy-intensive. By utilizing in situ redox reactions at a gram-scale, this study directly converts biomass fibers and copper precursors into a robust metal-bonded, defect-minimized graphite framework at 80 °C, enhancing its potential for sustainable engineering applications. When deployed as a fixed-bed reactor, the engineered catalyst demonstrates unprecedented operational stability, maintaining >99% contaminant removal efficiency during 21-day operation (flow rate: ∼8000 L h–1 m–2; hydraulic retention time: 37.3 s). Scalability analysis reveals a remarkable monthly processing capacity of 18,086 tons at an operational cost of 1.25 CNY/ton─representing an order-of-magnitude reduction compared to conventional industrial systems (30–60 CNY/ton). The high conductivity, stability, and adaptability complements its excellent performance, and the method can also be extended to other metals (e.g., Fe, Co) with similarly low energy requirements. The mild conditions of our synthesis method, coupled with the high stability performance, offer a sustainable oxidation decontamination route that nearly reaches the theoretical minimum energy consumption."

Here, we conducted controlled incubation of river water amended with DOM extracted from wildfire-affected versus undisturbed soils to assess molecular DOM transformations and microbial responses. High-resolution mass spectrometry and substrate-explicit modeling revealed that pyDOM introduction increased refractory components (e.g., condensed aromatics and tannins) with high modified aromaticity index (AImod) and double bond equivalents (DBE). Reactomics analysis revealed that pyDOM exhibited enhanced reactivity which may be associated with alterations in macromolecular electron shuttles and water solubility. While pyDOM introduction reduced overall riverine microbial diversity and abundance, it triggered a 17-fold increase of filamentous cyanobacteria abundance, simultaneously boosting both autotrophic capabilities and the functional abundance related to nitrogen metabolism in riverine microorganisms. Genomic evidence from PICRUSt2 analysis demonstrated pyDOM-driven enrichment of denitrification pathways, particularly through upregulation of periplasmic nitrate reductase components (napA + 3.0-fold; napB + 3.1-fold), suggesting enhanced aerobic denitrification capacity.

However, its effects on gypsum and silica scaling, as well as the underlying mechanisms, remain poorly understood. This study systematically investigates the effects of EMF treatment on gypsum and silica scaling in RO systems, utilizing synthetic brackish water and natural RO concentrate (ROC) from a desalination facility. For gypsum, EMF changes the crystal morphology, resulting in the formation of a porous, less compact scaling layer. It is more readily removed through hydraulic flushing (HF), enhancing scaling reversibility and water recovery. In the case of silica scaling, EMF promotes homogeneous polymerization in the bulk solution, producing larger silica particles that inhibit the formation of a dense, cross-linked gel layer on the membrane surface, mitigating flux decline. This study thus demonstrates EMF’s effectiveness in controlling gypsum scaling in undersaturated feedwaters when combined with HF and in mitigating silica scaling under both HF and non-HF conditions for supersaturated feedwaters. These findings underscore EMF’s versatility as a nonchemical approach for scale control in RO desalination and show its substantial potential to enhance membrane performance and operational efficiency in real-world water treatment applications."

The Lakes are highly efficient at bioaccumulating methylmercury, making the fish excellent sentinels for tracking shifts in atmospheric Hg deposition. Invasive mussels have altered biogeochemical processes, prey populations and fish dietary strategies asynchronously and to varied extents across the lower four lakes, impacting fish Hg exposure. To test if fish are adapting to new biogeochemical conditions, we analyzed a 40 year fish archive for carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios and amino acid-specific nitrogen isotope ratios. To assess Hg sources, we measured Hg isotope ratios. We reconstructed and compared energetic pathways that impact fish Hg concentrations to Hg-source trends. We found fish-Hg concentrations are declining but not monotonically due to ecological disturbances. Fish-Hg isotope values, unimpacted by ecological disturbance, confirm that sources of bioaccumulated Hg shift contemporaneously with changes in atmospheric Hg concentrations. Across Lakes, the degree of responsiveness to changes in atmospheric Hg concentrations mirrors the proportion of atmospheric-delivered Hg we previously modeled. Changes in both fish concentrations and fish isotope values outpace paleolimnetic reconstructions suggesting declines in atmospheric Hg concentrations impact fish Hg more than sediment."

Fe oxides generated in the presence of Cu(II), Cr(III), and/or OM exhibited elevated phosphate adsorption due to their small particle sizes. Our results highlight the previously underappreciated importance of HMs on Fe(II) oxidation and their potential effects on carbon and phosphate retention, which should be considered in predictive models of organic matter and phosphate sequestration."

Rising ocean temperatures and more frequent heatwaves have intensified phytoplankton blooms and hypoxic zones. To better understand these dynamics, we developed a 20-year data set of phytoplankton biomass (aph(443)) using MODIS satellite data. Our analysis shows a 23.8% decline in biomass over two decades, with the most significant reductions in spring, summer, and autumn. This decline is linked to warming sea surface temperatures (SST), which limit nutrient availability by enhancing ocean stratification. In contrast, winter warming was associated with a slight increase in biomass. Using machine learning, we identified SST as the dominant driver, explaining up to 65% of the seasonal trend. These findings offer valuable insights into the complex interactions between temperature, nutrients, and phytoplankton growth, informing coastal ecosystem management under climate change."

A Consequential LCA and Scenario Discovery Approach,"At the crossroads of climate change and land competition, agrivoltaic systems (AVS) propose a land-sharing synergy between photovoltaic (PV) electricity and crop production or animal husbandry. By partially covering crops with PV panels, AVS can enhance food production by maintaining favorable microclimatic conditions and can constitute a promising adaptation to climate change. However, the AVS electric and crop production performances vary extensively across crop types, climates, panel orientations, etc. While the few existing life-cycle assessment (LCA) studies evaluating AVS’s environmental performance cover a minor part of this diversity of configurations, a planned deployment policy for AVS requires extensive knowledge on the configurations that may or may not environmentally outperform conventional alternatives, i.e., conventional PV electric and crop productions. To identify these configurations, we built a parametrized consequential LCA model that simulates an AVS driven by either electricity demand or crop demand. We then applied a scenario discovery algorithm over stochastic AVS configurations to identify groups of AVS configurations that perform better or worse than their conventional counterparts. By parametrizing the technological and agronomical contexts, the interactions between PV and crop productions, and the electricity and land markets, we provide insights regarding how AVS should be designed, promoted, or discouraged."

In this work, we explore the optimal compatibility between catalysts, with metal oxides and carbon materials as examples, and oxidants with peroxymonosulfate and peroxydisulfate (PMS and PDS) as representatives. Metal oxides catalyze PMS effectively and exhibit an efficiency 1–3 orders of magnitude higher than when catalyzing PDS. Conversely, carbon materials catalyze PDS much more effectively, with an efficiency 1–3 orders of magnitude higher than when catalyzing PMS. The scientific mechanism behind such a compatibility is found to be attributed to the polarity-based matching effect between valence bonds on the catalyst surface and the oxidant molecules, following the polarity principle of “similarity-intermiscibility” theory. Composite materials containing metal and carbon prepared according to this mechanism demonstrate robust performance for both PMS and PDS, consistent with the predictions and validating the rationality and expandability of the compatibility principle.

However, quantifying the air photochemical age (PCA) in the boundary layer (BL) remains a challenge due to the limited vertical measurements and the difficulty in determining OH levels. Here, we explore the PCA across different heights and layers of the BL using the observed VOC ratios with varying reactivity and calculated OH levels using observation-based models. Results show that more reactive  species ratios of VOCs generally decrease with height across the BL, while less reactive species ratios show the opposite trend. Given the dominance by OH-exposure and OH levels, estimated PCA values exhibit significant seasonal and vertical variations, especially when differentiated by  thermal stratification. In the mixing layer (ML), the PCA is younger, with a minimal vertical gradient, whereas it becomes older in the stable BL and residual layer (RL). Specifically, in summer, the average PCA was 2.0 h in the ML and 2.65 h in the SBL and RL, much younger than in autumn, 6.8 h in the ML and 9.1–10.5 h in the SBL and RL.

This study represents the first large‐scale investigation of these compounds across coastal and open‐ocean environments. Atmospheric CH3Cl and CH3Br concentrations were substantially elevated in the ECS and SCS, exceeding Northern Hemisphere background levels by 12%–28%, whereas concentration enhancements over the northwest Pacific were 3%–5%. Elevated CH3Cl and CH3Br concentrations were attributed to long‐range terrestrial atmospheric transport from China, Korea, Japan, and the Philippines, as well as localized phytoplankton‐driven production in nutrient‐rich coastal waters. In contrast, CH3I concentrations were primarily controlled by photochemical processes mediated by dissolved organic carbon (DOC), with elevated levels being observed in the oligotrophic subtropical northwest Pacific (10°–30°N). Multiple regression analyses revealed that CH3Cl and CH3Br distributions were mainly influenced by terrestrial transport in coastal areas, whereas oceanic processes dominated their distributions in the open ocean. CH3I distributions primarily reflected oceanic photochemical production, with marginal terrestrial influence limited to the ECS. The production rates of CH3Br and CH3Cl in the ECS and SCS, respectively, were 2–3 times higher than those in the northwest Pacific, consistent with enhanced biological activity. Sea‐to‐air flux estimates demonstrated that the northwest Pacific and its marginal seas acted as net sources of all three methyl halides, with fluxes generally exceeding global averages by approximately 1.5–48 times.

This analysis evaluated around 50 estimates of anthropogenic methane emissions in the U.S. and China across all major sectors to identify areas of uncertainty and highlight opportunities for cross‐country collaboration. Shared sources of emissions with large variation in estimates and limited sector and region‐specific analyses include waste and livestock emissions, as well as abandoned fossil production sites (coal mines and oil wells), which present opportunities for knowledge sharing and joint leadership. Key areas for collaboration include improving data collection, monitoring, and availability to develop more detailed emission factors that take into account local conditions and temporal sources of emissions.

Exposures to compound wildfire smoke and extreme heat varied temporally and geographically, primarily driven by wildfire smoke. On average, ZCTAs experienced 3–4 CH days annually, peaking in 2020 (9.85 days).

The incremental lifetime cancer risk and hazard index values for people in NC were greater than those for people in CC and SC, and the health risk increased with increasing latitude. Based on ecological risk criteria and standard assessment methods, PAHs in PM in China pose a potential ecological risk, and the risk of harmful biological effects follows the order of NC > CC > SC.

 Understanding waterline variability at seasonal to interannual timescales is crucial for predicting coastal responses to climate forcing. However, relationships between large-scale climate variability and coastal morphodynamics remain underexplored beyond intensively monitored sites. This study leverages a newly developed 25-year (1997–2022) satellite-derived waterline dataset along the North American West Coast. Our results reveal distinct latitudinal patterns in seasonal waterline change, with excursions exceeding 25 m in the Pacific Northwest, decreasing to less than 10 m in Southern California and farther south. Waterline fluctuations strongly follow wave power in the Pacific Northwest (R = −0.78), northern California (R = −0.75), and Baja California (R = −0.62), while Baja California Sur aligns more with sea-level variations (R = −0.42). Interannually, waterline change exhibits latitudinal dependence: south of southern California, variability is low, with major erosion confined to strong El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, while northern regions show mixed responses. ENSO-driven storm track shifts modulate winter wave climate, resulting in enhanced (attenuated) erosion from southern California to Baja California Sur during El Niño (La Niña). However, further north, ENSO impacts are less consistent, reflecting a complex interplay of storm track displacement and intensification. These findings highlight the spatial complexity of ENSO-driven morphodynamics and provide a framework for assessing climate-induced coastal vulnerability.

 Scoria cones are the most abundant type of volcano in the Solar System. They occur in every tectonic setting and often overlap with human populations, yet our ability to provide complete geochronology within volcanic fields remains limited. Appropriate geochronology underpins the reconstruction of size-frequency distribution and is a key input for robust volcanic hazard assessment. Morphometric data have long been used to estimate relative ages of scoria cones; however, they have only shown promise at single volcanic fields and simple cones with homogenous pyroclastics. Here, we present a new global inventory of dated scoria cones (n = 572) from 71 volcanic fields formed under diverse magmatic, tectonic and climatic regimes, and build data-driven age models for dating scoria cones using easily accessible morphometric, reflectance and climatic variables.

 Intermittently closed estuaries provide important ecosystem services but are often overlooked in coastal and catchment research and management. These estuaries are highly vulnerable to human and climate disturbances due to their episodic closure to the ocean, yet remain understudied. This study maps 2245 intermittent estuaries globally, whose catchments currently support 55 million people, with projections of up to 101 million by 2100. Analysis of three decades of scholarly literature revealed that only 7% of these estuaries have been studied. Research on intermittent estuaries comprises 0.5% of all estuarine literature, despite representing 4–5% of estuaries globally. Major research gaps exist in Asia, South America, and Africa—regions with large, vulnerable populations. Over 90% of research on intermittent estuaries is conducted in (southern) Africa, Oceania, and North America, with most studies focusing on local physico-chemical and eco-hydro-geomorphological processes. This assessment underscores the need to expand research priorities to include ecosystem services, climate and human disturbances, and management, with greater international collaboration and leadership from intergovernmental organisations.

 How microcontinents successively migrated from Gondwana to Eurasia is paramount in understanding the Mesozoic evolution of the Tethys Ocean. The rifting and collision events and their potential spatio-temporal relationship may play a key role in this evolution. We compiled available Permian-Jurassic paleomagnetic data from the Lhasa terrane, revealing that it drifted away from Gondwana ~210 million years ago, which is ~10 million years earlier than the South-North Qiangtang collision. Similarly, the Lhasa-Qiangtang collision preceded the rifting of India by ~10 million years. These age gaps of similar kinematic circuits align well with the time required for collision-induced subduction transference, whereby a new subduction zone forms outboard of the newly accreted terrane. Then, the slab-pull force can be transmitted to the southern segment of the younger Tethys slab by coupling across the oceanic ridge/transform system, such that subduction transference drives the in-sequence one-way convergence of microcontinents with Eurasia.

 The fossil record shows a prominent 60 million-year biodiversity cycle during the Phanerozoic Eon, the origin of which is still unknown. Here we use time-series analysis and correlation of empirical and model datasets of Earth’s interior and surficial processes to demonstrate that this cycle is a pervasive feature in marine animal genus-level diversity data that dominates in the Paleozoic Era. Our results suggest that extinctions are likely the primary driver of this observed cyclicity. We detected a correlatable 60 million-year cyclicity in global tectonics, and in marine 87Sr/86Sr and δ34S isotopes, all of which are dominant in the Paleozoic. We conclude that continental weathering driven by global tectonic degassing and building of continental arcs may have in turn controlled paleo-seawater redox cycling during the Paleozoic when oceans were likely less saturated with respect to oxygen. In particular, we suggest that the 60 million-year fluctuations in biotic diversity are responses of shallow marine habitats to the combined effects of continental weathering and redox cycling, under global tectonic control.

 The snow and glaciers of the Peruvian Andes provide vital water supplies in a region facing water scarcity and substantial glacier change. However, there remains a lack of understanding of snow processes and quantification of the contribution of melt to runoff. Here we apply a distributed glacio-hydrological model over the Rio Santa basin to disentangle the role of the cryosphere in the Andean water cycle. Only at the highest elevations (>5000 m a.s.l.) is the snow cover continuous; at lower elevations, the snowpack is thin and ephemeral, with rapid cycles of snowfall and melt. Due to the large catchment area affected by ephemeral snow, its contribution to catchment inputs is substantial (23% and 38% in the wet and dry season, respectively). Ice melt is crucial in the mid-dry season (up to 44% of inputs). Our results improve estimates of water fluxes and call for further process-based modelling across the Andes.

 Under optimal growth conditions, net primary productivity (NPP) is a product of intercepted photosynthetic active radiation (Ipar) and maximum radiation use efficiency (RUEmax; conversion of Ipar to biomass). The objective of this study was to improve and validate the RUEmax-based Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) for the determination of grassland NPP by canopy multispectral reflectance collected at field (handheld sensor) and airborne (UAV) scale considering environmental constraints. The analysis was based on multi-year field experiments on sandy loam soil in Denmark, measured shoot and estimated root biomass to calculate NPP, long-term meteorological data, and daily NPP estimated from CO2 flux chamber measurements for deriving environmental constraints.The results derived from CO2 flux data showed that NPP and plant respiration were higher in the middle of the season before the second harvest when temperature was also high. The daily maximum air temperature optimal for grass biomass production was 16.5 °C. The improved CASA model built in this study was accurate for modeling NPP at both daily (nRMSE decrease of 9 %) and seasonal (nRMSE decrease of 8–34 %) scales when considering the best environmental constraints such as maximum air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, cloudiness, and water stress, compared to no constraints. Maximum air temperature and water stress were the most important environmental constraints to the grass RUEmax. Seasonal RUEmax for modeling NPP after considering best environmental constraints was 1.9–2.7 g C MJ−1 for ryegrass and 1.9–2.2 g C MJ−1 for grass-legume mixture using the two remote sensors for measuring spectral reflectance.

 Accurate and reliable ship target detection is of great significance for the sustainable development goals of ocean management. With the development of remote sensing technology, satellite imagery provides strong support for space-based tiny ship detection. However, remote sensing images have complex backgrounds, and it is challenging to separate and locate different numbers of small ship targets in different scenarios. The thermal infrared bands can capture the temperature differences between ships and the surrounding marine environment, enabling effective detection. Therefore, this study used the Sustainable Development Goals Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1) thermal infrared spectrometer (TIS) to develop a three-channel infrared small target detection (IRSTD) dataset with pixel-level annotations for all bands (SDG-IRSTD). The dataset contains 329 images from the SDGSAT-1 TIS and 3492 targets. Then a hierarchy features attention network (HFA-Net) for space-based tiny ship detection was proposed. The network generates enhanced feature maps of different scales through the multi-level detail enhancement module (MLDEM), employs a multi-level large kernel attention module (MLLKAM) which integrates the multi-scale mechanism with large kernel attention (LKA) to effectively model long-range dependencies on feature maps with different scales, and finally achieves feature fusion and interaction of different scales through the multi-level feature fusion module (MLFFM). In addition, the HFA-Net model improved intersection over union (IoU) and probability of detection (Pd) by 2.35 % and 3.97 %, respectively, and reduced false alarm rate (Fa) by 3.29 × 10−6, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) IRSTD methods.

 Methods based on upward canopy gap fractions are widely employed to measure in-situ effective LAI (Le) as an alternative to destructive sampling. However, these measurements are limited to point-level and are not practical for scaling up to larger areas. To address the point-to-landscape gap, this study introduces an innovative approach, named NeRF-LAI, for corn and soybean Le estimation that combines gap-fraction theory with the neural radiance field (NeRF) technology, an emerging neural network-based method for implicitly representing 3D scenes using multi-angle 2D images. The trained NeRF-LAI can render downward photorealistic hemispherical depth images from an arbitrary viewpoint in the 3D scene, and then calculate gap fractions to estimate Le. To investigate the intrinsic difference between upward and downward gaps estimations, initial tests on virtual corn fields demonstrated that the downward Le matches well with the upward Le, and the viewpoint height is insensitive to Le estimation for a homogeneous field. Furthermore, we conducted intensive real-world experiments at controlled plots and farmer-managed fields to test the effectiveness and transferability of NeRF-LAI in real-world scenarios, where multi-angle UAV oblique images from different phenological stages were collected for corn and soybeans. Results showed the NeRF-LAI is able to render photorealistic synthetic images with an average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 18.94 for the controlled corn plots and 19.10 for the controlled soybean plots. We further explored three methods to estimate Le from calculated gap fractions: the 57.5° method, the five-ring-based method, and the cell-based method. Among these, the cell-based method achieved the best performance, with the r2 ranging from 0.674 to 0.780 and RRMSE ranging from 1.95 % to 5.58 %. The Le estimates are sensitive to viewpoint height in heterogeneous fields due to the difference in the observable foliage volume, but they exhibit less sensitivity to relatively homogeneous fields. Additionally, the cross-site testing for pixel-level LAI mapping showed the NeRF-LAI significantly outperforms the VI-based models, with a small variation of RMSE (0.71 to 0.95 m2/m2) for spatial resolution from 0.5 m to 2.0 m. This study extends the application of gap fraction-based Le estimation from a discrete point scale to a continuous field scale by leveraging implicit 3D neural representations learned by NeRF. The NeRF-LAI method can map Le from raw multi-angle 2D images without prior information, offering a potential alternative to the traditional in-situ plant canopy analyzer with a more flexible and efficient solution."

 Since shifting sands pose a serious threat to surrounding areas, it is important to forecast their spatial trends in desert regions for better management of these areas. Given the importance of this issue, this study develops a hybrid approach to distinguish sand dunes from other desert features with deep neural networks and remote sensing techniques at different scales in the Nafud Desert in Saudi Arabia and the Registan Desert in Afghanistan. The study also models shifting sand dunes by combining morphometric features and infrared waves to predict their spatial boundary changes and associated risks. Moreover, the analysis of the relationship between morphometric features and climate parameters forecasts future spatial shifts of sand dunes. The results show that the hybrid deep learning model of Very Deep Super-Resolution (VDSR) and Laplacian effectively enhances image resolution for precise sand dune boundary extraction. Furthermore, the integration of topographic and spectral features into a new hybrid model, TPI, and K-Mean++ enables accurate prediction of spatial boundary changes in desert areas. The combination of deep neural networks and multi-resolution segmentation (MRS) identifies the optimal scale for sand dune separation as 90 and 100 m. Moreover, the analysis of spectral reflectance combined with the CA-Markov model and climate parameters indicates that infrared waves can predict shifting sand dunes with high accuracy and highlight them as a potential threat to surrounding lands. Morphometric-climate analysis further reveals how these shifts may evolve, aiding future hazard mitigation. This integrated approach advances our understanding of sand dune-climate interactions and offers a robust framework for managing desertification threats in vulnerable regions."

This study evaluates the capability of NASA’s Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) hyperspectral data, combined with canopy height metrics derived from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) LiDAR data, to retrieve SV and AGB in two heterogeneous mountain forests in Italy. We compared EMIT with Sentinel-2 (S2) multispectral data as model inputs, with and without GEDI data integration, using five Machine Learning (ML) algorithms: Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). We then applied the top-performing models to generate spatially explicit SV and AGB maps. Results demonstrated that EMIT-GEDI integration enhanced SV estimation accuracy (R2 = 0.75 RMSE = 75.48 m3 ha−1, GPR model) compared to S2-GEDI (R2 = 0.69 RMSE = 84.48 m3 ha−1, ANN model). AGB was retrieved with significantly lower accuracy than SV, and S2-GEDI models outperformed EMIT-GEDI ones, likely because of the higher S2 spatial resolution better capturing AGB variability associated to different tree species. GEDI LiDAR proved to be a necessary input for accurate SV and AGB retrieval, and GPR was the best-performing ML algorithm. The resulting spatial maps were artifact-free and successfully delineated ecological gradients and management patterns. This study underscores the promise of spaceborne hyperspectral-LiDAR data integration for SV and AGB mapping in mixed mountain forest ecosystems, However, it also emphasizes trade-offs between sensor spectral, spatial and temporal resolutions, thus the importance of upcoming hyperspectral missions, such as CHIME, combining hyperspectral capabilities with high spatial resolution and regular data acquisitions at global scale."

 Precipitation systems passing over cities can be modified by urban impacts. Compared with urban impacts on less-organized convective precipitation systems, urban modification of highly-organized or strongly-forced precipitation systems remains less understood. In this study, we examine urban impacts on a cold-frontal precipitation system passing over the Seoul metropolitan area, South Korea. For this, three sets of urban ensemble simulations with diurnal-mean anthropogenic heat intensities and urban momentum roughness lengths of (0 W m−2, 1 m), (45 W m−2, 2 m), and (90 W m−2, 3 m) and a set of nonurban ensemble simulations are performed. Comparisons with observations show that the characteristics and passage of the cold front are acceptably reproduced in all sets of the ensemble simulations. Precipitation is enhanced by about 20–40 % downstorm of Seoul in the urban ensemble simulations, with marginal delays in the movement of the precipitation system. The precipitation enhancement is hard to be discerned by a comparison between a single pair of urban and nonurban simulations, since the urban-induced precipitation enhancement is obscured by strong precipitation anomalies arising from different locations of precipitation cores in individual simulations. The downstorm precipitation enhancement is attributed to precipitation intensity increases in narrow cold-frontal rainband, which results from intensified frontal updrafts due to the increases in cross-frontal vorticity. The warm urban-heated air trailing the cold front after the frontal passage results in the increases in cross-frontal vorticity by decreasing temperature gradient at the frontal zone."

 Understanding anthropogenic CO2 emissions in megacities is important for mitigating climate change. In this study, we analyze tower-based carbon dioxide (CO2) mole fraction measurements at Beijing (BJ), Xianghe (XH), and Xinglong (XL) during two periods: November 2018 to March 2019 and November 2019 to March 2020. We compare the in-situ measurements with the simulated CO2 mole fractions from four emission inventories (ODIAC, EDGAR, MEIC, and CAMS) using the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport model (STILT). Our results show that the STILT model can generally simulate the daily anthropogenic fluctuations in CO2 mole fractions at all three sites (R > 0.6, P < 0.01), with consistent results across the two periods. At BJ, the ODIAC-based simulations have the smallest bias (−4.4 ppm) and RMSE (33.0 ppm) compared to the other three inventories. Emissions within a radius of 5–25 km around the BJ measurement site account for 33.45 %–82.99 % of the CO2 mole fractions enhancements. At XH and XL, the four inventories show a similar performance. The sensitivity of atmospheric CO2 background estimates is evaluated by comparing results from CarbonTracker and the XL background, and the two sets of background estimates differ in bias within 2.3 ppm. Moreover, we quantify the contribution of extremely strong emission sources (>3σ) in ODIAC, and find that they only contribute less than 5 % to CO2 mole fraction enhancements, depending on the distance between these extremely strong emissions and the measurement location."

 Glyoxal (CHOCHO) and formaldehyde (HCHO) are vital oxidization intermediates of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and play a significant role in studying VOC precursor sources. This research utilizes multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) to measure vertical column densities (VCDs) of CHOCHO, HCHO, and NO2 in Guangzhou, China, from June 2019 to June 2020. A sensitivity analysis for DOAS fitting was performed to accurately retrieve CHOCHO due to its low atmospheric concentration. Increased CHOCHO and HCHO levels from June to October 2019 were attributed to heightened photochemical oxidation, while higher CHOCHO levels in November and December 2019 were linked to increased anthropogenic emissions. CHOCHO and HCHO VCDs were lowest in the mornings, increasing with light intensity, whereas NO2 peaked in the mornings and evenings. Additionally, we utilized the CO-Ox trace pair to distinguish between primary and secondary HCHO sources, finding that 79.32 % of HCHO originated from secondary formation via photochemical processes. We employed four indicators (RGF, RGF-1, RGF-2, and RGF-3) to identify the sources of VOC precursors. RGF-1, RGF-2 and RGF-3, corresponding to different model scenarios with increased HCHOpri contributions, were greater than the traditional RGF, emphasizing the influence of AVOC while minimizing BVOC effects. These findings emphasize the importance of considering primary HCHO contributions for accurate VOC source identification and effective air pollution control strategies. Additionally, RGF values derived from MAX-DOAS were found to be 1.29 times higher than those from TROPOMI, suggesting a greater tendency of TROPOMI RGF to identify BVOC sources."

While the initiation of regeneration has been studied extensively, how the damage response ends and normal gene expression returns is unclear. We found that inDrosophilawing imaginal discs, the pioneer transcription factor Zelda controls the exit from regeneration and return to normal gene expression. Optogenetic inactivation of Zelda during regeneration disrupted patterning, induced cell fate errors, and caused morphological defects yet had no effect on normal wing development. Using Cleavage Under Targets & Release Using Nuclease, we identified targets of Zelda important for the end of regeneration, including genes that control wing margin and vein specification, compartment identity, and cell adhesion. We also found that GAGA factor and Fork head similarly coordinate patterning after regeneration and that chromatin regions bound by Zelda increase in accessibility during regeneration. Thus, Zelda orchestrates the transition from regeneration to normal gene expression, highlighting a fundamental difference between developmental and regeneration patterning in the wing disc."

Unlike PltB typhoid toxin, little is known about the tropism and functional consequences of PltC typhoid toxin. Here, we report that PltC typhoid toxin has hepatobiliary tropism through the binding of PltC subunit to sulfated glycans on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and gallbladder epithelial cells. Critical bacterial and mammalian cell factors involved are PltC R109 residue and carbohydrate sulfotransferases CHST2/4. One notable effect associated with the hepatobiliary tropism of PltC typhoid toxin is a reduction in bile acids, consequently promotingS.Typhi pathogenicity in infected mice. Similarly, bile acids serve as anti–S.Typhi infectivity agents at the cellular level, as bile acids inhibit invasion of mammalian cells. These findings highlight a distinct mechanism used by a bacterial exotoxin promoting the pathogenicity of the cognate bacteria and offer insights into the development of antivirulence agents against PltC typhoid toxin and/orS.Typhi."

Notably, L-cDC2s are predominantly distributed in barrier tissues such as the lungs and skin. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis revealed the enrichment of lymphocyte signature genes in L-cDCs. We identified lymphocyte-primed cDC precursors, which are distinct from pDC-like cells, as sources of L-cDCs. Compared with M-cDC2s, L-cDC2s weakly primed T cells under low-dose antigen stimulation and preferentially promoted T helper 2 (TH2) differentiation under sufficient antigenic stimulation.

To explore receptor trafficking, genetically encoded approaches (e.g., the fusion of fluorescent proteins to receptors) are often used. However, concerns remain that genetic approaches cannot fully reproduce the receptor functions that are inherent to neurons. Herein, we report on PFQX1(AF488), a fluorescent probe for the visualization of cell-surface AMPARs without any genetic manipulation to neurons. The rapid and reversible staining features of this probe enabled snapshot imaging, which showed the accumulation of native AMPARs in dendritic spines during synaptic plasticity. Moreover, the mechanism of this synaptic accumulation, for which genetically encoded approaches have given controversial results, was revealed by integrating two chemical methods: PFQX1(AF488) and covalent chemical labeling."
