While fish filets are more commonly analyzed for their significance to human health, whole fish are useful to determine ecological impacts, but published methods such as EPA 1633 do not produce reliable results for this more challenging matrix. Here we show that lipid removal technology produces clean extracts without the need for solid-phase extraction or evaporative concentration, which often lead to loss of some PFAS. This method achieves an accuracy of 96 ± 9% for the detection of 45 PFAS while also offering benefits of a simple procedure, reduced processing time, and decreased waste generation compared to multistep cleanup and concentration methods. A test of freeze-drying demonstrated that compounds detected in Great Lakes fish were retained, but volatile compounds including sulfonamide precursors and ethanols were lost. To demonstrate field performance, the entire method was applied to whole-fish composites from Lake Michigan. Results from these samples reveal that the PFAS concentration was driven by collection location, while the distribution of PFAS was dictated by fish species."

However, the main reasons behind this phenomenon, especially the absorption and transportation processes of Pb in the intestine, have not been elucidated, which is the major barrier to reducing blood Pb levels in the human body, especially in adolescents. In this study, we explored the intestinal absorption process of Pb in rats of different ages at environmentally relevant concentrations. The results indicated that albumin serves as a crucial mediating role in the process of gradually decreasing Pb levels with age (aging). Next, experiments with induced senescence and the addition of albumin confirmed that binding to albumin facilitates the absorption and transportation of Pb. Furthermore, a low-protein diet can reduce Pb levels by approximately 50%, possibly due to a decrease in the synthesis of albumin resulting from reduced raw materials. Collectively, these findings reveal the potential reasons for high Pb levels in adolescents, elucidate the influence of albumin on Pb absorption and transportation, and provide an alternative pathway for regulating intestinal Pb absorption in adolescents at ambient concentrations."

Number concentrations and sizes of emitted particles are critical for assessing the climate and health impacts of shipping emissions. Here, we build the direct ship particle number (SPN) emission inventory and further propose a computationally efficient approach (look‐up table, EIPN) to estimate particle number emission by accounting for the subgrid process of ship plumes. In the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) coastal area along East China Sea, the total ship particle number emission estimated based on EIPN is 7.3 × 1023 particles with the values of 5.9 × 1024 particles predicted by the SPN, showing a notable overestimation by a factor of ∼8 (compared to EIPN). The particle number and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) under 0.4% water supersaturation (CCN0.4) conducted utilizing the EIPN with normalized mean biases (NMB) of −13.1% and −28.6% exhibit higher concordance with observations than those using the conventional mass emission inventory (NMB = −37.7%, −44.9%) and SPN (NMB = −57.4%, −72.2%), demonstrating the significant improvement in 3‐D models. Ship‐related particles have large spatiotemporal variations, and their contribution to CCN is driven by secondary particles. Our results support the influence of ship emissions on coastal air aerosols and CCN and highlight the importance of accounting for ship plume subgrid processes."

Common surface measurements may misleadingly imply this process due to low nighttime ozone at surface level in winter. However, our study reveals a more complex picture by unveiling the vertical dynamics of nitrate formation through an integration of tethered airship campaign, long‐term ground measurements, and model simulations. Interestingly, we observed rapid nitrate growth at approximately 400 m altitude, where the box model revealed optimal conditions for sustained nocturnal nitrate production. The nitrate accumulated overnight in the residual layer (RL) is transported downward in the next morning as the nocturnal boundary layer breaks down, substantially increasing surface‐level nitrate and thus exacerbating pollution. Annual‐averaged diurnal patterns of nitrate measured at the ground station clearly confirm this morning increase. The vertical mixing from the RL contributes up to 80% of the total surface nitrate at 10:00 LT with its influence persisting at 31% even after sunset. Air mass trajectory analysis further confirms that emissions from city‐cluster significantly contribute to downwind pollution by transporting pollutants into the RL. This research underscores the important role of RL chemical processes, facilitated by elevated ozone, in shaping surface‐level pollution. It highlights the indispensability of vertical profiling in understanding aerosol pollution and advocates for regionally coordinated control strategies across eastern China."

Protat,Simulation of Cloud Processes Over Offshore Coastal Antarctica Using the High‐Resolution Regional UK Met Office Unified Model With Interactive Aerosols,"The Southern Ocean and offshore coastal Antarctica are key regions for global climate. Low level mixed‐phase clouds strongly control the surface radiation budget of this region but remain challenging for climate models because of the complex processes controlling the sources and sinks of cloud liquid water, including both cloud liquid water and ice crystals. Here, we examine these interactions using the Unified Model (UM) regional climate model, with the Cloud AeroSol Interacting Microphysics (CASIM) and UK Chemistry and Aerosol (UKCA) models included for interactive aerosol and cloud microphysics. We simulate two case studies from the second field campaign of Clouds Aerosols Precipitation Radiation and atmospheric Composition over the Southern Ocean Phase 2 (CAPRICORN‐2), which represent the open ocean and the offshore coastal region of Antarctica. Compared with these observations, we find that the UM underestimates surface aerosol concentration by up to an order of magnitude and investigate the effect of this bias on the simulated cloud microphysical and radiative properties. We find that the cloud liquid water path (LWP) and surface radiative fluxes are also biased in the offshore coastal Antarctic case study, with a 32% mean underestimation of LWP and 76% mean overestimation of downwelling surface shortwave flux. Sensitivity tests show that the cloud liquid water bias is largely caused by deficiencies in the representation of the meteorology, and less by aerosol or cloud microphysical properties. Our results provide key insights on the modeling of cloud processes in high southern latitudes."

Standardizing input and output data is a crucial step in evaluating and communicating results, but can be challenging when using models with diverse structures, assumptions, and outputs that address region‐specific issues. We developed an implementation framework and workflow to standardize the climate and fishing forcings used by regional models contributing to the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project (FishMIP) and to facilitate comparative analyses across models and a wide range of regions, in line with the FishMIP 3a protocol. We applied our workflow to three case study areas‐models: the Baltic Sea Mizer, Hawai'i‐based Longline fisheries therMizer, and the southern Benguela ecosystem Atlantis marine ecosystem models. We then selected the most challenging steps of the workflow and illustrated their implementation in different model types and regions. Our workflow is adaptable across a wide range of regional models, from non‐spatially explicit to spatially explicit and fully‐depth resolved models and models that include one or several fishing fleets. This workflow will facilitate the development of regional marine ecosystem model ensembles and enhance future research on marine ecosystem model development and applications, model evaluation and benchmarking, and global‐to‐regional model comparisons."

The impact of these factors on coastal urban buildings and infrastructure must be better understood. Alexandria, a historic and densely populated port city in Egypt representative of several coastal towns in the Southern Mediterranean, has experienced over 280 building collapses along its shorelines over the past two decades, and the root causes are still under investigation. We examine the decadal changes in coastal and hydroclimatic drivers along the city's coastline using photogrammetric satellite images from 1974 to 2021. We explore the interconnectivity between shoreline retreat, ground subsidence, and building collapses. Our results suggest that collapses are correlated with severe coastal erosion driven by sediment imbalances resulting from decades of inefficient landscape management and urban expansion along the city's waterfront. This severe erosion, combined with sea level rise, increases seawater intrusion, raising groundwater levels in coastal aquifers. Degrading ground stability and accelerating corrosion in building foundations ultimately culminating in collapses. We identified a coastal area of high vulnerability with over 7,000 buildings at risk, surpassing any other vulnerable zone in the Mediterranean Basin. We propose cost‐effective and nature‐based techniques for coastal landscape adaptation to alleviate these dangers in Alexandria and other Southern Mediterranean cities facing similar climatic challenges."

Cannon,Characterizing Compound Inland Flooding Mechanisms and Risks in North America Under Climate Change,"Compound inland flooding (CIF) arises from the concurrent interaction of multiple hydrometeorological drivers. In this study, we characterize key CIF events across North America, including two preconditioned events, rain‐on‐snow (ROS) and saturation excess flooding (SEF) for historical baseline conditions and global warming levels of 1.5, 2, and 4°C relative to the preindustrial level. Utilizing the high emission climate scenario (RCP8.5) from CanRCM4‐LE with 50 members, the frequency and seasonality of compound events, along with the probability of these events leading to heavy runoff, and the relative role of external forcing and internal climate variability are assessed. We convert the identified hazards into risk levels by integrating them with exposure and vulnerability components. The results suggest that as global temperatures increase, the overall role of ROS events in causing significant runoff is projected to decrease compared to individual heavy rainfall. Concurrently, the impact of SEF occurrences is projected to become more pronounced. The signal‐to‐noise ratio highlights a high‐confidence change signal for CIF events; however, uncertainty related to internal climate variability in future projections of joint probability with heavy runoff is more pronounced. These results underscore the need to consider compound mechanisms, dynamics, and risks associated with CIFs within systematic approaches to flood risk management."

Current studies of CDHE are mostly conducted in observations or coarse‐resolution global climate model large ensembles. While the latter allow for the assessment of rare CDHE against the backdrop of internal variability, global ensembles fail in providing robust climate change signals at impact‐relevant scales. To overcome this issue, we exploit a regional 50‐member single‐model initial condition large ensemble (SMILE). The SMILE provides an extensive database of CDHE in a current climate and at two global warming levels (+2°C, +3°C) across Europe in high geographical detail. We identify Northern France, Southern Germany, Switzerland, Southern Ireland, and the western coasts of the Black Sea with currently low CDHE frequency as emerging hotspots. These regions experience a tenfold increase of CDHE under global warming conditions, in parts resulting in yet unseen heat and dryness. Temperature is the dominant driver of frequency increases, except for western Europe. Additionally, tail dependence strengthens in regions with large increases in CDHE frequency. In European agricultural areas, soil moisture shows stronger negative correlations with CDHE intensity than with precipitation or temperature. Finally, our results indicate 50% $50\hspace*{.5em}\%$ fewer CDHE summers in a +2°C world compared to a +3°C world, highlighting the importance of climate mitigation to reduce the frequency of these multi‐hazard events."

Vafeidis;Leigh R. MacPherson,Accounting for Compound Flooding Can Prevent Maladaptation—A Baltic Sea Case Study,"Estuarine areas are currently at risk of compound flooding, the frequency and intensity of which is expected to increase with climate change. Even though efforts are made to adapt against single flood drivers using hard protection, potential subsequent changes in flood risk due to compound flooding are often overlooked in flood risk assessments. This is because risk assessments mostly focus on individual flood drivers and do not account for changes in risk from adaptation measures. We address this question and use hydrodynamic modeling to simulate compound flooding for two adaptation scenarios. We consider adaptation in terms of storm surge barriers, in two locations along the Trave estuary, namely Schlutup and Trave, at Lübeck, Germany. We assess the effectiveness of both storm surge barriers in reducing flooding by simulating individual‐driver, as well as low‐ and high‐magnitude compound flood scenarios. We find that while during low‐magnitude compound flooding both barriers reduce the overall flood extent by 25%–86%, high‐magnitude compound flooding leads to an increase of up to 100%, depending on the location of the barrier. Our results suggest that the river contribution is amplified by 52%–100% by the Schlutup Barrier. The Trave Barrier, however, only amplifies flood extents in the high‐magnitude compound flood scenarios. Our findings highlight the need to consider compound flooding in adaptation planning to avoid defense failure and unexpected increases in risk. However, as this study considers only two (low probability) extreme events, a more comprehensive approach is necessary to fully understand the overall impact on risk."

The microgravity environment causes a host of physiological changes, and exposure to dust on the Moon caused considerable pulmonary distress to astronauts during the Apollo missions. As the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and other organizations prepare for long‐duration exploration missions to Mars, the hazards and consequences of the Martian surface need to be accounted for. This review investigates how substances analogous to hazardous components of Martian dust have caused disease in people on Earth. Because of its small grain size, dust on Mars is more likely to cause lung irritation, absorb into the bloodstream, and lead to diseases in astronauts. Toxic components of martian dust include perchlorates, silica, nanophase iron oxides, and gypsum in addition to trace amounts of toxic metals whose abundances are debated: chromium, beryllium, arsenic, and cadmium. Predicted effects of dust exposure ranges from asymptomatic to life‐threatening, with many substances being carcinogenic and most damage impacting the pulmonary system. The longer transit time for astronauts to return home makes the operations of performing emergency medical treatment more difficult and increases both the likelihood and consequences of developing chronic disease. Exposure mitigation needs to be prioritized; however, supplements may be taken to prevent disease from breakthrough exposures, and treatment regimens could lessen morbidity and mortality. Treatments and equipment need to be carefully considered and transported with the astronauts to be prepared for all possible scenarios."

Outcomes were quantified using pediatric cancer diagnosed among children <20 years of age (1992–2014) from the Nebraska cancer registry. We adjusted for social vulnerability factors such as race, income, employment, and access to care. The associations between 32 agrichemicals and cancer subtypes were assessed using the Generalized Weighted Quantile Sum Regression (gWQS) model. The model was fit assuming a Poisson distribution and using the pediatric population as an offset‐term and social vulnerability factors as covariates. We observed a statistically significant positive association between the 32 agrichemicals and overall pediatric cancer and subtypes.

Here, the authors identify peripheral mechanisms regulating energy homeostasis, showing that MC3R is a regulator of hepatic autophagy, hepatic fat accumulation, and fat partitioning, controlling systemic adiposity. 
 Systemic lipid homeostasis requires hepatic autophagy, a major cellular program for intracellular fat recycling. Here, we find melanocortin 3 receptor (MC3R) regulates hepatic autophagy in addition to its previously established CNS role in systemic energy partitioning and puberty. Mice with Mc3r deficiency develop obesity with hepatic triglyceride accumulation and disrupted hepatocellular autophagosome turnover. Mice with partially inactive human MC3R due to obesogenic variants demonstrate similar hepatic autophagic dysfunction. In vitro and in vivo activation of hepatic MC3R upregulates autophagy through LC3II activation, TFEB cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation, and subsequent downstream gene activation. MC3R-deficient hepatocytes had blunted autophagosome-lysosome docking and lipid droplet clearance. Finally, the liver-specific rescue of Mc3r was sufficient to restore hepatocellular autophagy, improve hepatocyte mitochondrial function and systemic energy expenditures, reduce adipose tissue lipid accumulation, and partially restore body weight in both male and female mice. We thus report a role for MC3R in regulating hepatic autophagy and systemic adiposity. Systemic lipid homeostasis requires hepatic autophagy to recycle intracellular fat. Here, the authors identify peripheral mechanisms regulating energy homeostasis, showing that MC3R is a regulator of hepatic autophagy, hepatic fat accumulation, and fat partitioning, controlling systemic adiposity."

Here, the authors report on a protective hydrogel for promoting rhizobacteria colonization to enhance growth and improve adaptability of plants to acidic soil. 
 Endophytic plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRs) could replace chemical fertilizers in sustainable agriculture. Unfortunately, they are susceptible to harsh environmental conditions. Here, we proposed a polymeric hydrogel (PMH) consisting of carboxymethyl chitosan, sodium alginate, and calcium chloride for loading and protecting endophytic PGPR. This hydrogel can load endophytic PGPRs to not only boost its growth-promoting efficiency, but also help them adapt more effectively to environments. Using endophytic PGPR Ensifer C5 as model bacteria and Brasscia napus as host, we demonstrate that the PMH facilitate the colonization of endophytic PGPRs in the apical and lateral root primordia regions. Further analysis indicates that the PMH modulate suberin deposition of the endodermal cell layers and regulate the accumulation of auxin at the root tip. Meanwhile, PMH enhances the antioxidant capacity and disease resistance properties of plants by increasing the content of arachidonic acid metabolism intermediates in the plant. Importantly, the combination of PMH and endophytic PGPRs increases the yields of B. napus by approximately 30% in the field. Furthermore, PMH attenuates the loss of endophytic PGPR activity in the acidic environments. Overall, this microbial encapsulation strategy is a promising way to protect fragile endophytic microorganisms, providing attractive avenues in sustainable agriculture.

 Clustered protocadherins (cPcdhs) belong to the cadherin superfamily and play important roles in neural development. cPcdhs mediate homophilic adhesion and lead to self-avoidance and tiling by giving neurons specific identities in vertebrates. Structures and functions of cPcdhs have been studied extensively in past decades, but the mechanisms behind have not been fully understood. Here we investigate the in situ assembly of cPcdh-γB4, a member in the γ subfamily of cPcdhs, by electron tomography and find that the full length cPcdh-γB4 does not show regular organization at the adhesion interfaces. By contrast, cPcdh-γB4 lacking the intracellular domain can generate an ordered zigzag pattern between cells and the cis-interacting mode is different from the crystal packing of the ectodomain. We also identify the residues on the ectodomain that might be important for the zigzag pattern formation by mutagenesis. Furthermore, truncation mutants of the intracellular domain reveal different assembly patterns between cell membranes, suggesting that the intracellular domain plays a crucial role in the intermembrane organization of cPcdh-γB4. Taken together, these results suggest that both ectodomain and intracellular domain regulate the in situ assembly of cPcdh-γB4 for homophilic cell adhesion, thereby providing mechanistic insights into the functional roles of cPcdhs during neuronal wiring.

 Oral drug delivery systems had natural potential for colorectal cancer drug therapy. While the drug delivery efficiency is severely hindered by the complex intestinal barriers, especially mucus and epithelium barriers, resulting in unsatisfactory therapeutic effects and limited clinical translation.

The nanomotor shows intestinal mucus barrier penetration and the paracellular pathway reversibly opening properties of intestinal epithelium barrier, increasing the delivery efficiency of cisplatin by 3.5 folds.

 High crop yields require adequate nutrients, particularly nitrate (N) and phosphorus (P). Identifying regulators for efficient N-P utilization is critical in wheat. To explore N-P interactions, we analyze root transcriptomes under varying N-P supplies and identify TaTCP6 as a potential regulator. Nitrate-stimulated TaTCP6 directly triggers the expression of genes related to nitrogen utilization. TaTCP6 competes with TaSPX1/4 for the release of TaPHR2, and also interacts with TaPHR2 to enhance the transactivation capacity of downstream genes. Thus, through the dual roles of TaTCP6, the TCP6-SPX-PHR2 module activates the expression of phosphorus starvation response (PSR) genes. Inhibiting TaTCP6 reduces N and P absorption, negatively impacting yield, while overexpressing TaTCP6 increases grain yield. Notably, overexpression of TaSPX1 suppresses nitrogen utilization genes, especially under low phosphorus conditions. In conclusion, our findings highlight the role of TaTCP6 in coordinating N and P utilization and propose a strategy to reduce fertilizer inputs for sustainable agriculture. A nitrate-induced transcription factor TaTCP6 is identified as a central regulator for the efficient and balanced utilization of nitrate and phosphorus, and a moderate increase in its expression promotes wheat yield."

 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal cancer with a 12% survival rate, highlighting the need for novel therapies. c-MYC overexpression, driven by upstream mutations and amplifications, reprograms tumor metabolism and promotes proliferation, migration and metastasis. This study identifies ELOVL6, a fatty acid elongase regulated by c-MYC, as a potential therapeutic target. Using PDAC mouse models and cell lines, we show that c-MYC directly upregulates ELOVL6 during tumor progression. Genetic or chemical inhibition of ELOVL6 reduces proliferation and migration by altering fatty acid composition, affecting membrane rigidity, permeability and pinocytosis. These changes increase Abraxane uptake and show a synergistic effect when combined with ELOVL6 inhibition in vitro.

 Understanding dissolved organic matter (DOM) transformation is crucial for comprehending soil biogeochemical cycling. However, the extent that soil microbes mediate DOM transformation at the molecular level, and whether this is regulated by fertilization remain largely unknown. Here we investigated soil DOM transformations under long-term fertilization using Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, high-throughput sequencing, and machine learning. Fertilization greatly promoted transformation potential of DOM molecules. Organic fertilization increased the mean transformation number of DOM molecules by 260% compared to no-fertilization, while chemical fertilization increased it by 193%. Machine learning indicated that intrinsic DOM molecular characteristics could predict transformation potential, especially for medium- or low-transformation-potential molecules. However, high-transformation-potential DOM molecules were more influenced by soil microorganisms. Our study provides a parameter to characterize potential transformation capacity of DOM molecules, the effects of different fertilization treatments on this potential, and highlights microbial contributions to molecular transformation processes, identifying the key microbial groups.

 Sedimentary volcanism is a widespread geological phenomenon on Earth. Similar processes are theorized to occur on extraterrestrial bodies like Mars, potentially representing surface expressions of subsurface liquid water reservoirs. As we are currently missing ground truth, recognizing signs of extraterrestrial mud volcanism is based on comparative analysis with terrestrial mudflows. Despite the ubiquitous presence of salts on planetary surfaces, it remains unclear how different dissolved salts in mud mixtures influence the behavior of erupted mud. Our study integrates laboratory experiments, thermodynamic calculations, and rheometry measurements to investigate how concentrations of NaCl, MgSO4, Na2SO4, and CaSO4 affect such behavior. The results show that 10 wt.% MgSO4 and only 2.5 wt.% NaCl maximizes mud propagation, producing ropy patterns and narrow flows, while higher salt concentrations result in sheet-like flows covering wider areas. When the mud is supersaturated in salt, the liquid state is prolonged but propagation is reduced. Hence, mud salinity has a significant influence on mud flow behavior in low-pressure environments, reflecting the balance between anti-freezing effects and viscosity-compositional effects. Our experimental results are limited to bentonite muds, yet the sensitivity to salt type/concentration is also expected for other muds, leading to a much broader range of morphology, longevity and spatial dispersion than previously assumed.

 Cut-off Lows are slow-moving mid-latitude storms that are detached from the main westerly flow and are often harbingers of heavy and persistent rainfall. The assessment of Cut-off Lows in climate models is relatively limited, in fact, there are no studies conducted on the future changes of Cut-off Lows within climate models. Given the importance of Cut-off Lows in leading to severe hazards, here we study them in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6’s worst-case future simulations (SSP5-8.5). Most (80%) of the models show that Cut-off Lows with high intensity and longer lifetimes are projected to become more frequent in spring over the land regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Such an increase in Cut-off Low frequency could substantially increase related potential hazards. An increase in Cut-off Low propagation velocity, however, may partly offset this increase in hazard.

 Surveillance is crucial for maintaining critical infrastructure integrity and disaster risk reduction. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles have emerged as vital tools for aerial inspections, offering flexibility, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. A significant challenge in UAV surveillance is the precise detection of damaged electrical components, particularly in complex environments where numerous objects are in close proximity that may cause hazards. Traditional methods often fall short under these demanding conditions, leading to notable monitoring deficiencies. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel detection method utilizing the Transformer architecture, named InspecNet. This approach leverages the architecture’s proficiency in understanding contextual information, which significantly enhances the accuracy of identifying key damaged components: damaged ceramic insulators, burned ceramic insulators, and loose U-bolts. These components are particularly challenging to detect due to their subtle and variable damage signatures. Through extensive data augmentation, we have created a new and diverse sample set to train our model and improve its detection capabilities. Our experimental evaluation, conducted with an extended set of UAV image data, demonstrates a detection accuracy increase of 20 % over conventional methods, achieving a precision of 95.7 %, recall of 93.1 %, and a mean average precision (mAP) of 92.9 %.

 High-spatiotemporal-resolution sea surface salinity (SSS) estimations are essential for understanding marine phenomena in both coastal seas and open oceans. Although studies have enhanced the resolution of SSS estimations using ocean color (OC) satellite data, the limited variance of OC signals and weak correlation with SSS in open oceans have confined these advancements to coastal seas. To overcome this limitation and broaden the scope of research, a machine learning-based approach is proposed that combines multi-source data. Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) was used as an input variable for a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model along with Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) SSS and multi-scale ultra-high-resolution sea surface temperature (MURSST) to simulate corrected and gap-filled Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) SSS for East Asia. The high-quality SSS data generated by the proposed approach, with fine spatial (500–m) and temporal (hourly) resolutions, simulated detailed seasonal and spatial variations in SSS across both coastal seas and open oceans. In validation with in situ observations, the MLP model performed better than SMAP, achieving an R2 of 0.80 and an RMSE of 0.92 psu, whereas SMAP achieved an R2 of 0.76 and an RMSE of 1.05 psu. Shapley additive explanations analysis revealed that the contributions of input variables to SSS estimations varied by region and season. In the open ocean, HYCOM SSS and MURSST made significant contributions, compensating for the weaker relationship with Rrs. In coastal areas, Rrs412 and Rrs555 showed a positive correlation with SSS.

 Changes in cropland are among the most widespread transitions on the Earth surface, significantly impacting food security, ecological conservation, and social stability. Compared to conventional change events, cropland changes involve complex dynamic transformations of semantic representations within the land system, requiring the identification of both the locations and categories of changes. Despite numerous remote sensing change detection methods have been proposed in previous studies, two challenges in cropland semantic change detection (SCD) still deserve further discussion: 1) transition confusions between similar categories and 2) under-labeling and class imbalance related to semantic labels. To address these challenges, we propose a difference enhancement and class-aware rebalancing semi-supervised network (Semi-DECRNet) for cropland SCD. The proposed Semi-DECRNet is implemented in a multi-task three-branch architecture, incorporating a multi-scale semantic aggregation difference enhancement module to couple the semantic and initial differential features at both global and local levels to model the temporal and causal relationships among the binary change detection and semantic segmentation branches. Additionally, a class-aware rebalancing self-training strategy is developed to adaptively calibrate the pseudo-label thresholds and further mine the semantic knowledge in unchanged areas. Experiments and analysis on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed Semi-DECRNet method for the cropland SCD task.

 Wildfires pose a great threat to the ecological environment and human safety. Therefore, rapid and accurate detection of wildfires holds significant importance. However, existing wildfire detection methods neglect the full integration of spatial–temporal relationships across different scales, and thus suffer from issues of low robustness and accuracy in varying wildfire scenes. To address this, we propose a deep learning model for near-real-time wildfire detection, where the core idea is to integrate multi-scale spatial–temporal features (MSSTF) to efficiently capture the dynamics of wildfires. Specifically, we design a multi-kernel attention-based convolution (MKAC) module for extracting spatial features representing the differences between fire and non-fire pixels within multi-scale receptive fields. Moreover, a long short-term Transformer (LSTT) module is used to capture the temporal differences from the image sequences with different window lengths. The two modules are combined into multiple streams to integrate the multi-scale spatial–temporal features, and the multi-stream features are then fused to generate the fire classification map. Extensive experiments on various fire scenes show that the proposed method is superior to JAXA Wildfire products and representative deep learning models, achieving the best accuracy scores (i.e., average fire accuracy (FA): 88.25%, average false alarm rate (FAR): 20.82%). The results also show that the method is sensitive to early-stage fire events and can be applied in the task of near-real-time wildfire detection with 10-minute Himawari-8/9 satellite data.

 The effects of local climate parameters, seasonality and sources of air masses on the stable water isotopes [hydrogen (δ2H) and oxygen (δ1⁸O)] in precipitation were investigated along an altitudinal gradient (381–1118 m a.s.l.) in southern Bohemia, Central Europe, from December 2021 to November 2023. The relationship between the observed δ2H and δ18O values was consistent with the Global Meteoric Water Line. The isotopic composition of precipitation changed with increasing altitude by −6.5 and −1.2‰ km−1 for δ2H and δ18O, respectively. The δ values differed between seasons, with the values being most enriched in summer and most depleted in winter. An analysis of the air mass trajectories using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model showed that the main sources of precipitation were the North Atlantic (from 44% in spring to 70% in fall and winter), the Arctic Ocean (from 15% in summer to 38% in spring) and the Mediterranean Sea (from 12% in winter to 34% in summer). Throughout the study period, average δ values differed significantly between air masses (p < 0.05) and along the altitudinal gradient, with the most enriched values (from −56 to −37‰ for δ2H and from −8.2 to −5.5‰ for δ18O) and the most depleted values (from −91 to −84‰ for δ2H and from −12.7 to −12.0‰ for δ18O) occurring in the Mediterranean and Arctic air masses, respectively. However, for individual daily samples, strong correlations occurred between the δ values and air temperature (the strongest), humidity, precipitation, time of sunshine and solar radiation, while the influence of air mass directions was not significant. A stepwise regression analysis showed that most of the variation in daily δ values (43–48% and 47–52% of δ2H and δ18O, respectively) was explained by the combination of air temperature and humidity, precipitation amount, and season."

 Ambient nitrous acid (HONO) plays a crucial role in the atmosphere's oxidative capacity, significantly impacting air quality and climate. This study reviews the current understanding of HONO formation mechanisms, including in-situ and vertical gradient measurements, as well as the temporal, spatial, and vertical characteristics of HONO and its modeling approaches. HONO concentrations exhibit significant diurnal variation based on sources and sinks in different environments. Typically, concentrations are higher near the ground and decrease with altitude. Additionally, this study examines the incorporation of contemporary HONO chemical mechanisms into box models, regional and global chemical transport models (CTMs), and chemistry-climate models. Models often underestimate observations due to uncertainties in heterogeneous HONO formation and varying measurement techniques. Finally, this review identifies key challenges for future HONO measurements and modeling efforts. Significant opportunities remain to enhance our fundamental understanding of HONO. Precision and accuracy are important for advancing HONO observation measurement techniques. Simultaneously, the representation of HONO in state-of-the-art models helps us better quantify atmospheric oxidation capacity and air quality impacts."

 Sulfate (SO42−) is an essential constituent of aerosols that play an important role in regulating global climate. Over the past decades, polar sea-ice cover changed significantly, potentially influencing the atmospheric budget of SO42−. However, limited research has been conducted to quantify the effects of sea ice on atmospheric SO42− over different times and regions. Here, we report the SO42−/Na+ mass ratios of aerosols and precipitation samples collected in coastal East Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula during 2016–2022. The SO42−/Na+ mass ratios at both sites show similar seasonal trends; aerosols display higher ratios than precipitation in summer, with no significant difference in winter, possibly due to precipitation preferentially removing coarse-mode aerosols. The percentage of air mass travelling time over sea ice (P-Time) is positively correlated with SO42−/Na+ mass ratio (or nss-SO42− concentrations) in summer, suggesting the enhanced atmospheric SO42− production over sea ice due to higher dimethyl sulfide (DMS) emissions and/or enhanced oxidation chemistry of DMS. But this relationship becomes negative during winter, suggesting the predominant influence of sea salt aerosols (SSA) from the sea ice surface on atmospheric SO42− levels. In winter, the SO42−/Na+ mass ratio appears to be relatively invariable when the P-Time exceeds ∼40–60 %, ranging from ∼0.08 to 0.18. The lower limit of the mass ratio, ∼0.08, likely representing the influence of sea ice SSA on the mass ratio. Based on this value, it is estimated that approximately half of the atmospheric SO42− in winter originates from sea ice SSA. These findings highlight the importance of sea ice on aerosol budgets and atmospheric chemistry in polar regions."

Villarin;Jun Matsumoto,Assessing the performance of GSMaP and IMERG in representing the diurnal cycle of precipitation in the Philippines during the southwest monsoon season,"•Diurnal cycle of monsoon precipitation from two satellite products was examined. •GSMaP_G performs better for precipitation amount and frequency. •IMERG_F better captures precipitation intensity. •Short-duration light-intensity precipitation events are dominant in both products. •GSMaP_G (IMERG_F) had better CSI values for light (moderate) precipitation events. 
 The Philippines faces the challenge of having a limited number of rain-gauge stations, which are a vital source of observation data. Satellite-based precipitation data is a viable alternative; however, it is necessary to assess the strengths and weaknesses of these products over various regions in the Philippines. This study analyzes the performance of two leading products from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, namely: GSMaP_G v08 and IMERG_F v07. In particular, the diurnal cycle of precipitation in the Philippines during the southwest monsoon season (May to September) from 2013 to 2018 is assessed, in terms of precipitation amount (PA), frequency (PF) and intensity (PI), which has not been done in previous works. Results show that GSMaP_G outperforms IMERG_F in capturing the diurnal cycle for PA and PF, whereas IMERG_F better captures PI as GSMaP_G tends to underestimate PI consistently. In terms of timing, peak values for PA (PPA) and PF (PPF) have similar patterns for both station data and satellite products where these events develop during the afternoon to evening hours (15 to 18 Local Standard Time). Further examination of the possible drivers of these observed patterns suggests that for both station data and IMERG_F, short-duration events have the highest frequency contribution (≥ 60 %), while GSMaP_G has higher contribution (≥ 40 %) from long-duration precipitation events. However, in analyzing the contributions where intensity is considered, both station data and satellite products were observed to be dominated by short-duration light precipitation events (≥ 60 %). These results indicate that during the southwest monsoon season in the Philippines, the main drivers for PA and PF are short-duration light precipitation events, whereas PI may be driven more by localized rain showers. This may indicate that GSMaP_G is more suitable for examining hourly precipitation events that are more frequent but have a lower intensity, whereas IMERG_F may prove to be more useful when analyzing hourly precipitation events with higher intensities such as localized rain showers."

 This paper explores the influence of the presence of clouds on sky radiances. It also analyses their impact on the retrieval of aerosol properties when using an inversion algorithm whose radiative transfer model (RTM) is designed for cloud-free atmospheres. For that, synthetic observations are simulated for 9 partially cloudy skies and for their equivalent cloud-free skies, considering 16 different aerosol scenarios. A parameter named cloud enhancement factor (CEF) has been used to determine the modifications induced in the sky radiances by each partially cloudy scenario with respect to the cloud-free sky. This parameter indicates that the sky radiances remaining after applying a cloud-screening are affected by the presence of clouds. In general, they show enhancements between 0 and 20 % with respect to the cloud-free radiances, depending on the cloudy conditions and the scattering angle. The synthetic observations used as input for the retrieval of aerosol properties are the ones required by the inversion strategy used, GRASPpac: the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and sky radiances at 4 different wavelengths together with the ceilometer range corrected signal (RCS). In partially cloudy scenarios with low CEFs, the aerosol properties do not present significant changes with respect to the cloud-free conditions. However, for partially cloudy scenarios with higher CEFs, a clear differentiation between the aerosol optical properties retrieved with and without clouds is observed. In these scenarios, the precision of the retrieval is similar for both conditions, but the accuracy is lower for the cloudy conditions. In particular, under partially cloudy conditions, it is observed an overestimation of the real refractive index (RRI) and the single scattering albedo (SSA) between 0.05 and 0.06 and between 0.03 and 0.06 respectively, and an underestimation of the asymmetry factor (g) and the imaginary refractive index (IRI) of about −0.02 and − 0.005, respectively. These values slightly vary with the aerosol load and wavelength for the RRI and SSA. The effects on the size distribution parameters are very small, concluding that the impact of clouds is noticeable in the optical properties but not so much in the microphysical part."
