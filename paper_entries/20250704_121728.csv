10.5194/acp-25-6741-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究探讨了非极地区域的海表温度变化如何影响极地的能量平衡。通过理想化的海表温度扰动实验，发现热带和中纬度海洋的增温会通过增强大气能量输送来提高极地温度，导致极地地区的地表增温和大气层顶部的冷却。该研究侧重于海表温度变化对极地气候的影响，而非直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['sea surface temperature', 'polar energy budget', 'atmospheric energy transport', 'climate teleconnections', 'radiative feedbacks']",Qingmin Wang;Yincheng Liu;Lujun Zhang;Chen Zhou,Responses of polar energy budget to regional sea surface temperature changes in extra-polar regions,"Our research explores how SST (sea surface temperature) changes in non-polar regions impact the polar energy budget. Through idealized SST experiments, we found that warming in tropical and mid-latitude oceans raises polar temperatures through enhanced atmospheric energy transport, leading to surface warming and top-of-atmosphere cooling in polar areas. This study highlights the distinct impacts of tropical Pacific and Indian Ocean SST changes on Arctic and Antarctic climates. 
 Surface temperature at polar regions not only is affected by local forcings and feedbacks but also depends on teleconnections between polar regions and low-latitude regions. In this study, the responses of the energy budget in polar regions to remote sea surface temperature (SST) changes are analyzed using a set of idealized regional SST perturbation experiments. The results show that the responses of the polar energy budget to remote sea surface warmings are regulated by changes in atmospheric energy transport, and radiative feedbacks also contribute to the polar energy budget at both the top of atmosphere (TOA) and the surface. Specifically, an increase in poleward atmospheric energy transport to polar regions results in an increase in surface and air temperature, and the corresponding Planck feedback leads to radiative warming at the surface and radiative cooling at the TOA. In response to sea surface warmings in most mid-latitude regions, poleward atmospheric energy transport to polar regions in the corresponding hemisphere increases. Sea surface warming over most tropical regions enhances the polar energy transport to both Arctic and Antarctic regions, except that an increase in the Indian Ocean's temperature results in a decrease in poleward atmospheric energy transport to the Arctic due to the different responses of stationary waves. The sensitivity of the Arctic energy budget to tropical SST changes is generally stronger than that of the Antarctic energy budget, and poleward atmospheric heat transport is dominated by dry static energy, with a lesser contribution from latent heat transport. The polar energy budget is not sensitive to SST changes in most subtropical regions. These results help to explain how the polar climate is affected by the magnitude and spatial pattern of remote SST change."

Numeric simulations and real data applications revealed the importance of considering depolarization measurements and the superiority of the irregular–hexahedral model in the retrieval of dust aerosols from lidar measurements. 
 Mineral dust is a key atmospheric aerosol agent that impacts the radiation budget and plays a significant role in cloud formation. However, studies on retrieving height-resolved microphysical properties of dust aerosols, which are crucial for understanding dust evolution, transport processes, and radiative effects, from lidar measurements are still insufficient. Here, we retrieve dust aerosol microphysical properties, including the volume size distribution (VSD), total volume concentration (Vt), effective radius (reff), complex refractive index (CRI), and single-scattering albedo (SSA), from spectral extinction (α), backscattering (β), and depolarization (δ) lidar measurements. We evaluate the performance of three particle scattering models, namely the spherical, spheroidal, and irregular–hexahedral (IH) models, in terms of mimicking dust optical properties and deriving retrieval results when different measurement combinations are inverted. Both simulations and inversions of real lidar measurements confirm the superiority of the IH model and the significance of spectral depolarization measurements to improve the retrieval accuracy. An increase in discrepancy in depolarization ratio produced by the IH and spheroid models is observed for reff>0.5 µm, resulting in larger retrieval difference between the two non-spherical models after the inclusion of 3δ. Comparisons of the real case retrievals with Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) retrievals and previous in situ results indicate relatively smaller reff and larger SSA derived from the lidar retrievals. A discussion of the possible reasons is presented."

Overall, power plant CO2 emissions were largely consistent with local electricity consumption patterns, with most plants emitting less at night than during the day and with higher emissions in winter compared to spring and autumn. 
 Coal-fired power plants are a major source of global carbon emissions, and accurately accounting for these significant emission sources is crucial in addressing global warming. Many previous studies have used Gaussian plume models to estimate power plant emissions, but there is a gap in observation capabilities for high-latitude regions and nighttime emissions. However, large emitting power plants exist in high-latitude areas. The DQ-1 satellite is equipped with the world's first active remote sensing lidar for detecting CO2 column concentrations, which, compared to passive remote sensing satellites, enables observations in these regions. This paper applies a two-dimensional Gaussian plume model to the XCO2 results from the DQ-1 satellite and analyses the instantaneous CO2 emissions of 10 power plants globally. Among these, 15 cases of data are from nighttime observations, and 3 cases are from power plants located above 60° N latitude. The estimation results show good consistency when compared with emission inventories such as Climate TRACE and Carbon Brief, with a correlation coefficient R = 0.97. The correlation coefficient between the model fits and satellite observations ranges from 0.49 to 0.88, and the overall relative random error in the estimates is 15.11 %. This paper also analyses the diurnal differences in CO2 emissions from power plants and finds emission fluctuations directly correlated with regional electricity demand dynamics. This method is very effective for monitoring emissions from strong point sources such as power plants."

To our knowledge, the resolution and length of this dataset are enough to detect the asymmetry, vertical tilt, and temporal evolution of mesoscale eddies (MEs) and the corresponding submesoscale processes. The dataset is expected to improve the accuracy of current and biogeochemistry numerical models. More projects conducting AUV experiments will be promoted in the future. 
 Marginal seas are often characterized by dynamic mesoscale eddies (MEs), whose evolution plays a critical role in regulating global oceanic energy budgets, triggering submesoscale processes with strong vertical velocity, and facilitating biogeochemical transport. However, traditional observation methods, constrained by passive sampling modes, struggle to resolve the temporal evolution of MEs and associated submesoscale processes at kilometer-scale resolutions. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and underwater gliders (UGs), operating in active sampling modes, provide spatio-temporal synchronized measurements of these highly dynamic features. Here, we present a 9-year (2014–2022) high-resolution temperature–salinity dataset collected by AUVs/UGs in the South China Sea (SCS), accessible via https://doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.11996 (Qiu et al., 2024b). In total, the dataset comprises 11 cruise experiments that deployed 50 UGs and two AUVs, achieving spatial and temporal resolutions of < 7 km and < 7 h, respectively. This dataset offers unprecedented insights into ME evolution life stages, covering the zones of an eddy's birth, propagation, and dissipation. A total of 40 % of the data resolve submesoscale processes (< 1 km, < 4 h), capturing dynamic instabilities along and across frontal zones at eddy peripheries. This dataset has the potential to improve the forecast accuracy in physical and biogeochemistry numerical models. Much more aggressive field investigation programs will be promoted by the National Natural Science Foundation of China in the future."

 Vertical profile observations of atmospheric composition are crucial for understanding the generation, evolution, and transport of regional air pollution.

Flowers;Matthew J. Hoffman,Computationally efficient subglacial drainage modelling using Gaussian process emulators: GlaDS-GP v1.0,"Subglacial drainage models represent water flow beneath glaciers and ice sheets. Here, we train fast statistical models called Gaussian process (GP) emulators to accelerate subglacial drainage modelling by ~ 1000 times. We use the fast emulator predictions to show that three of the model parameters are responsible for > 90 % of the variance in model outputs. The fast GP emulators will enable future uncertainty quantification and calibration of these models. 
 Subglacial drainage models represent water flow at the ice–bed interface through coupled distributed and channelized systems to determine water pressure, discharge, and drainage system geometry. While they are used to understand processes such as the relationship between surface melt and ice flow, the number of uncertain model parameters and the computational cost of running models makes it difficult to adequately explore the high-dimensional parameter space and evaluate uncertainty in model predictions. Here, we develop Gaussian process (GP) emulators that make fast predictions with associated uncertainty of subglacial drainage model outputs. Using a truncated principal component (PC) basis representation, we construct a GP emulator for diurnally averaged subglacial water pressure. We also explore emulation of scalar variables describing drainage efficiency and configuration. We train the emulators using ensembles of up to 512 simulations varying eight parameters of the Glacier Drainage System (GlaDS) model on a synthetic domain intended to represent an ice-sheet margin. The emulators make predictions ∼ 1000 times faster than GlaDS simulations, with errors <3 % for the water pressure field and ∼ 5 %–9 % for drainage efficiency and configuration. We apply the emulators to explore the eight-dimensional parameter space by computing variance-based parameter sensitivity indices, finding that three parameters (ice flow coefficient, bed bump aspect ratio, and the subglacial cavity system conductivity) explain 90 % of the variance in modelled water pressure in response to parameter changes. The GP emulator approach described here is well suited to integrating observational data with models to make calibrated, credible predictions of subglacial drainage."

This study first reveals the coupling coordination mechanisms between carbon efficiency and carbon equity based on Chinese provincial data from 2012 to 2017. We demonstrated that the carbon efficiency and carbon equity exhibited a strong coupling coordination relation (CCR). Carbon efficiency significantly promoted carbon equity and was a major driver of the CCR. With every 1 unit increase in carbon efficiency, carbon equity and the CCR increased by 3.766 to 5.694 units and approximately 1-2 units, respectively, and the positive impact of carbon efficiency on the CCR was approximately 6 to 8 times that of carbon equity. Carbon efficiency, carbon equity, and the CCR worsened between 2012 and 2017, and the bottom 50% of them were mainly concentrated in central and western provinces with abundant natural resources and net inflow of embodied carbon emission. Additionally, we demonstrated that resource dependence hindered carbon efficiency, carbon equity, and the CCR, and the potential transmission pathways were the crowding-out effect on the technology innovation, digital informatization, and advancement of industrial structure."

Environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) are abundant on BC surfaces, yet their reactivity and structural characteristics remain poorly understood. This study demonstrates that EPFRs on BC surfaces drive the rapid decay of coexisting phenolic acids, leading to the formation of more toxic products. Novel integrated approaches, including temperature-programmed desorption mass spectrometry and electrochemical capacitance measurements, indicate that these EPFRs are predominantly composed of oxygen-containing functional groups with superior electron storage and transfer capabilities. Statistically significant linear correlations are observed between phenolic acid decay rates and EPFR concentrations, oxygen-containing group abundances, and electron transfer capabilities. Furthermore, the presence of nitrate ions is found to accelerate phenolic acid degradation. Human body clearance and human-related organ toxicity predictions suggest that transformation products are less readily cleared by the human body than the parent compounds and are more likely to cause liver toxicity. These findings highlight the critical role of EPFRs in BC chemistry, emphasizing their potentially underestimated environmental and health impacts."

However, studies employing multicomponent systems remain limited. This study investigates the role of minerals in •OH photochemical generation in the presence of organic compounds with distinct functional groups. Using model compounds to represent key moieties in dissolved organic matter (DOM), we examined the capacity of both single-component systems (organic matter and minerals) and composite systems (ferrihydrite-organic matter) to generate •OH. Our findings demonstrate that low-molecular-weight organics such as oxalate and citrate, rich in carboxyl groups, significantly enhance •OH production when combined with ferrihydrite. In contrast, organic molecules with aromatic or quinone-like structures (e.g., Aldrich humic acid (AHA) and 9,10-anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonic acid disodium salt (AQDS)) tend to suppress •OH production. Specifically, the ferrihydrite-citrate system shows a doubling of •OH production under solar light and a 20-fold increase under visible light at pH 3. Conversely, the addition of ferrihydrite significantly inhibited •OH production in the AQDS system, which by itself had a strong ability to generate •OH. Furthermore, mineral transformation and organic carbon loss suggest that •OH photochemical generation could accelerate the geochemical cycling of iron and carbon. These insights deepen our understanding of the mechanisms underlying •OH generation and the environmental implications of iron–carbon interactions at the irradiated interfaces."

Therefore, this study employed incubation experiments using HA-treated soil columns under continuous flooding (CF) and alternating wet–dry (AWD) to explore the relationship between CH4 production and CO2 fixation. The results demonstrate that HA significantly increased CH4 emissions, with a 102.87% rise under CF conditions and a 135.13% increase under AWD. In contrast, CO2 emissions remained unaffected under both conditions. Key microbial groups, such as Methanosarcina, were enriched by HA, with a 15.01% increase in methanogen abundance under CF and a 6.36% increase under AWD. Additionally, the upregulation of key intermediates, such as acetyl-CoA and tetrahydrofolate, was significantly higher in HA treatments. A Mantel test demonstrated the coupling between carbon fixation and methanogenesis pathways. In conclusion, HA promoted the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway in Methanobacterium for CO2 conversion into acetyl-CoA and facilitated acetoclastic methanogenesis in Methanothrix through acetate utilization. These findings advocate prioritizing AWD-HA integration in water-secure regions to balance soil carbon retention and emission reduction.

Previous reviews mainly emphasized ROS toxicity and Fenton chemistry-related reactions, neglecting a comprehensive understanding of ROS distribution and hotspots, formation mechanisms, and ecological effects. Here, the most advanced in situ and ex situ detection methods of ROS in soil and sediment are first summarized to address these gaps. ROS hotspots are identified as active microinterfaces and oxic–anoxic fluctuation zones by graphing the distribution of ROS in soil and sediment. Second, ROS formation processes and mechanisms are outlined, which involve natural organic matter (NOM) and biochar (acting as electron shuttle, geobattery, geoconductor, and photosensitizer), transition metals (mainly via Fenton and Fenton-like reactions), and microbes (producing extracellular ROS and mediating NOM decomposition or metal oxides reduction). Further, as for the ecological effects of ROS, they impact the microbial community, nutrient cycle, and the transformation of organic pollutants and multivalence heavy metals. Finally, we call for more future research that focuses on developing rapid and in situ ROS detection techniques, elucidating the interactive ROS formation mechanisms by trace environmental components, analyzing ecological consequences in ROS hotspots, and practically applying ROS in soil and sediment. A comprehensive understanding of the ROS formation process in soil and sediment is crucial for the study of soil carbon sequestration and natural remediation processes in the context of global green and low-carbon development."

Leavitt,The Clumped Isotope Signatures of Multiple Methanogenic Metabolisms,"Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, an important energy source, and an important part of the global carbon cycle. The relative abundances of doubly substituted (“clumped”) methane isotopologues (13CH3D and 12CH2D2) offer important information on the sources and sinks of methane. However, the clumped isotope signatures of microbially produced methane from different methanogenic pathways lack a systematic investigation. In this study, we provide a data set encompassing isotopic signatures of hydrogenotrophic, methylotrophic, acetoclastic, and methoxydotrophic methanogenesis. We find that a statistical “combinatorial effect” generates significant differences in 12CH2D2 compositions between hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and the other pathways, while variations in the fractionation factors of clumped isotopologues result in differences in 13CH3D compositions between the methylotrophic, acetoclastic, and methoxydotrophic pathways. The energy yield of methanogenesis and the energy conservation approaches implemented by different microbial strains may also influence the isotope values of methane. Further analysis suggests that previously observed isotopic signatures of methane in freshwater environments are potentially due to mixing between hydrogenotrophic and other methanogenesis pathways. This study provides new experimental constraints on the isotope signatures of different microbial methanogenic pathways and evidence of the mechanisms responsible for the observed differences. This enables a better understanding of the sources and sinks of methane in the environment."

However, soil DOM is heterogeneous with varying molecular weights (MW), and how the dynamic interplay between DOM molecules and Fe oxides affects the sequestration of different OC species remains elusive. In this study, we separated DOM into <3, 3–10, and >10 kDa fractions by ultrafiltration to investigate the dynamic distribution of OC species at the molecular level and subnanoscale during ferrihydrite-OC coprecipitate transformation. Compared with the low MW DOM fraction, the higher MW DOM fractions inhibited Fe oxide transformation less, but showed stronger sequestration ability on Fe oxides, due to more aromatic compounds with higher carboxyl number per molecule. Despite the above difference, the released DOM during mineral transformation was similar to mainly nonaromatic compositions. At the nano to subnanoscales, aromatic-rich compounds were sequestered within the defective/porous structure of Fe oxides, whereas high crystalline Fe oxides promoted the sequestration of carboxyl-rich compounds. Our study provides novel insights into the sequestration mechanisms of different OC species during Fe oxide transformation and highlights the significance of incorporating MW-dependent DOM compositions when predicting SOC stability."

Herein, electronic density-dependent catalysts based on FeOCl with externally coordinated moieties were fabricated to fulfill the switching of the catalytic oxidation mechanism in peroxymonosulfate (PMS)-based Fenton-like reactions. The experimental results indicate that the catalytic activity and reaction mechanism vary with the changes in electronic density around the Fe site, which determines the contributions of radical and nonradical mechanisms, thus achieving selective or nonselective oxidation. Theoretical simulations indicate that Fe sites with sufficient electronic density are inclined to adsorb the O sites of the O–O bond followed by subsequent electron transfer and radical generation. Conversely, Fe sites with a deficient electronic density tend to adsorb the terminal O of PMS, facilitating the oxidation of PMS to form sulfate radical anions, which then convert to singlet oxygen. The sustained activity of loaded catalysts during the 10 h continuous operation of the scaled-up experiment demonstrated their potential for practical application. This work brings an in-depth insight into the catalytic mechanism of the Fenton-like reaction and guides the electronic engineering of catalysts to meet the specific demands of various experimental scenarios."

However, time-resolved stream 6PPD-Q concentration data remain scarce. We measured rainfall, discharge, and 6PPD-Q concentrations in an urban salmon-bearing stream over four rain events to capture the antecedent dry weather (baseflow) and the increased streamflow (stormflow). Portable autosamplers proved to be effective for continual water sampling. The resulting time series revealed 6PPD-Q flushing during stormflow, likely influenced by surface runoff from roads upstream. Following the initial rise in stream stage (+5% depth), mean 24 h time-averaged 6PPD-Q concentration was 45.0 ng/L, 25-fold higher than baseflow, and the mean 24 h load was 3.73 g, 220-fold higher than the preceding 24-h period. Measured 6PPD-Q concentrations, which peaked at 237.0 ng/L, exceeded the LC50 reported for juvenile coho salmon for periods ranging from 3.5 to 18.7 h during rain events, but never during the preceding dry period. Accordingly, coho salmon habitat can be subjected to repeated pulses of 6PPD-Q over the course of the wet season during elevated streamflow periods, which may expose spawning adults, juveniles, and hatching fry to toxic concentrations for considerable periods."

Drought, sea-level rise, navigation channel dredging, and watershed land-use change increase the risk of salinization and threaten drinking water supplies, agricultural irrigation, and infrastructure (via corrosion). The emerging issue of salt contamination of water supplies in tidal rivers and its diverse impacts highlight the critical need for interdisciplinary research that must integrate knowledge from oceanography, hydrology, and water resource management. Here we elucidate oceanic and hydrological processes regulating saltwater intrusion into estuaries and tidal rivers as well as watershed processes driving enhanced chemical weathering and export of watershed salts into rivers. By synthesizing studies around the world, we discuss how sea-level rise, prolonged drought, and increasingly extreme weather events in a changing climate are driving more frequent saltwater intrusion events that threaten water security globally. We propose a convergent research agenda toward the development of a decision support tool for salinity management. Specifically we recommend making ion-specific measurements and developing hydrological–hydrodynamic models to simulate the transport of major salt ions. These models can then be combined with artificial intelligence algorithms and enhanced monitoring to explore management strategies with stakeholders."

Yet, mechanisms governing the Atlantic warming, particularly the role of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), remain uncertain. Through ocean‐only and coupled model experiments, we confirm the key role of the weakened AMOC in the enhanced Atlantic heat storage. Physically, the reduced poleward heat transport of AMOC causes an additional heat pile‐up in the 15°S–45°N regions with a lag time of ∼10 years. Based on this dynamical linkage, we propose that the regional enhanced heat storage in the 15°S–45°N Atlantic relative to the global average serves as a fingerprint for the long‐term AMOC change. The observed heat storage indicates an overall AMOC slowdown by only 1.31 ± 0.39 Sv since the 1950s.

In stark contrast to conventional irradiance retrieval algorithms that are confined to individual pixel information, this work proposes the STARNet (Spatio‐Temporal Association‐based Retrieval Network), which is a deep‐learning algorithm that exploits the information embedded in the spatio‐temporal neighbors of a target pixel. The algorithm holds three technical innovations: (a) a data preprocessing method that highlights the correlation‐ and causality‐type climatology associations in the original reflectance and brightness temperature observations; (b) a graph network cascade that extracts topological spatio‐temporal features, and (c) a multi‐scale convolution network that extracts regular spatio‐temporal features. The empirical part of this work showcases irradiance retrieval from Fengyun‐4A over China. True out‐of‐sample verification demonstrates that STARNet can outperform physical and conventional data‐driven retrieval algorithms.

Detailed radiocarbon dating of loess in central Europe reveals concurrent increases in dust activity in dust‐emitting regions. However, the causes of these changes in dust emission and the role of dust in rapid climate change remain unclear. We address this uncertainty through multi‐proxy analysis of loess sources in Hungary. Our results demonstrate that loess particles were dominantly produced by subglacial grinding processes in the eastern Alps. These particles were released along with stadial Alpine Ice Sheet‐driven meltwater pulses, turning major river systems into efficient dust sources for loess deposition in Europe. Concurrent strengthened anticyclonic circulation over northern Europe would have caused wider dispersal of Alpine Ice Sheet‐derived dust as far as Greenland. Resultant continental‐hemispheric scale changes in atmospheric dust loading likely amplified concomitant North Atlantic climate cooling and ice sheet decay during Greenland stadials."

Six storms formed within a month, surpassing the climatological mean by 4 standard deviations. Four storms were simultaneously active—an event unmatched in 45 years. This anomaly was linked to exceptionally strong Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO)‐related suppressed convection over the Indo‐Pacific warm pool, triggering a Kelvin wave response that enhanced cyclonic circulation and moisture convergence, and reduced vertical wind shear over the WNP. All subseasonal‐to‐seasonal models, including the ECMWF, deep learning FuXi‐S2S, and WNP TC hybrid models, predicted the active TC period beyond 4 weeks.

To investigate such wave motion, here we conduct laboratory experiments in which fully submerged tall blocks of pure ice are oscillated vertically in a homogeneous saltwater environment and measure the resultant melting rates. Our results indicate that oscillatory motion strongly enhances melting rates, which are controlled by side melting, above a critical velocity threshold of 3–9 times the meltwater plume velocity, with the melting rate following a velocity to the 4/5 $4/5$ths scaling similar to previous results with steady motion.

But the instrumental record is short and provides a limited dynamic range with which to test assumptions about H2 cycling. Here, we compare twentieth century H2 levels reconstructed from polar firn air to the output from a historical run of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Atmospheric Model 4.1 (GFDL‐AM4.1). Simulated H2 exhibits reasonable agreement with the reconstruction. The twentieth century increase in H2 levels is consistent with rising atmospheric methane levels and changing emissions from fossil fuel combustion. However, the model fails to capture the reconstructed reversal in the interpolar H2 gradient between 1960 and 1990. We invert an 8‐box model of the atmosphere to show that the reversal in the interpolar difference requires a large increase (decrease) in the simulated NH (SH) net source of H2 peaking circa 1980. Revisions to our estimates of historical biomass burning emissions, photochemical production, and/or anthropogenic emissions could help resolve the discrepancy. Our optimization also implies a 15% increase in the strength of the soil sink in the NH mid to high‐latitudes from 1970 to 2000, which is qualitatively consistent with expectations based on changing soil moisture and temperature. We also show that smaller adjustments to the H2 budget would be needed to explain the reversal in the interpolar gradient if the H2 deposition lifetime were shorter than commonly accepted. A shorter lifetime may be supported by recently identified geological sources of H2."

Formation of a Bow Echo,"The merger of squall line and supercell has been commonly observed in the Great Plains of the United States. On 23–24 May 2020, an isolated supercell formed ahead of a squall line and subsequently evolved into a bow echo through their merger. Utilizing a 10‐min update four‐dimensional variational data assimilation system that integrates radar and surface observations, we investigated the convective‐scale processes that led to the formation of this bow echo. Our findings indicated that as the squall line advanced eastward, its inflow was initially obstructed by the supercell, causing the weakening of both the squall line and its associated cold pool. However, during the merger, a strong rear inflow jet (RIJ) rapidly developed ahead of the squall line's leading edge and behind the supercell. Unlike a classic RIJ that typically expands rearward over the cold pool, this RIJ accelerated forward toward the supercell. Diagnostic pressure analysis revealed that the RIJ was primarily driven by the developing mesolow embedded within the supercell. Additionally, the supercell's strengthening prior to bowing generated a deep‐tropospheric gravity wave downdraft, which amplified the RIJ by enhancing near‐surface westerlies. Despite the weakening of the squall line's cold pool, it still contributed to the RIJ formation by providing negative horizontal vorticity at its leading edge and facilitating the RIJ's descent. Consequently, the intense RIJ and the subsequent replacement of the supercell against the initial leading edge led to the formation of a severe bow echo, producing a broad swath of damaging winds."

This pristine convection occurred ahead of an eastward‐propagating squall line, despite the absence of discernible surface convergence, and later evolved into a supercell that eventually merged with the approaching squall line. The atmospheric environment, which featured a low‐level inversion layer with considerable convective inhibition, was generally unfavorable for surface‐based convective initiation (CI). However, our analysis indicated that the spatial heterogeneous nocturnal southerly low‐level jet (LLJ) played a key role in the elevated CI. As the LLJ advected moisture and warm air, neighboring regions experienced substantial low‐level destabilization. Multiple convergence bands associated with the heterogeneous LLJ were identified, and the timing and location of CI were governed by these bands. CI occurred when one of the convergence bands moved northward to a position beneath a divergence band at the entrance of the mid‐tropospheric jet. This overlapping pattern of convergence‐divergence persisted for over an hour, facilitating both the initiation and development of the supercell. Additionally, we observed two other episodes of CI ahead of the squall line, each with different characteristics. The first, occurring earlier than the supercell initiation, was triggered by topographic convergence in a valley but quickly dissipated. Later, as the LLJ rotated clockwise, the most prominent convergence band shifted eastward, favoring the continuous development of forward‐building cells ahead of the squall line, resulting in a T‐shaped system."

The new model effectively corrected overestimation and underestimation of ozone levels by WRF‐CMAQ and global climate models, respectively. Anthropogenic efforts will overcome the adverse effect of climate and reduce future ozone concentration especially in eastern China and warm season with greater ozone pollution. From a long‐term perspective, energy structure transition was estimated to play a more important role than end‐of‐pipe emission controls with a former to latter ratio of ozone reduction during 2017–2060 at 2.7.

Following injury of the periderm, ethylene leaks out through the wound and oxygen enters, resulting in attenuation of ethylene signalling and hypoxia signalling. This condition promotes periderm regeneration in the root. When regeneration is complete and barrier integrity is re-established, pre-injury levels of ethylene and hypoxia signalling are regained. Gas diffusion monitoring is also used to re-establish the barrier in inflorescence stems after the epidermis is injured. We thus propose that gas diffusion is used by plants as a general principle to monitor and re-establish barrier integrity. A study using Arabidopsis shows that plants can monitor the integrity of their outer barriers by sensing gas diffusion, enabling them to initiate wound repair to prevent water loss and pathogen entry."

 Multi-omics studies, represented by connectomes and spatial transcriptomes, have entered the era of single-cell resolution, necessitating a reference brain atlas with spatial localization capability at the single-cell level1–4. However, such atlases are unavailable5. Here we present a whole mouse brain dataset of Nissl-based cytoarchitecture with isotropic 1-μm resolution, achieved through continuous micro-optical sectioning tomography. By integrating multi-modal images, we constructed a three-dimensional reference atlas of the mouse brain, providing the three-dimensional topographies of 916 structures and enabling arbitrary-angle slice image generation at 1-μm resolution. We developed an informatics-based platform for visualizing and sharing of the atlas images, offering services such as brain slice registration, neuronal circuit mapping and intelligent stereotaxic surgery planning. This atlas is interoperable with widely used stereotaxic atlases, supporting cross-atlas navigation of corresponding coronal planes in two dimensions and spatial mapping across atlas spaces in three dimensions. By facilitating the data analysis and visualization for large brain mapping projects, our atlas promises to be a versatile brainsmatics tool for studying the whole brain at single-cell level.

 Ancient Egyptian society flourished for millennia, reaching its peak during the Dynastic Period (approximately 3150–30 bce). However, owing to poor DNA preservation, questions about regional interconnectivity over time have not been addressed because whole-genome sequencing has not yet been possible. Here we sequenced a 2× coverage whole genome from an adult male Egyptian excavated at Nuwayrat (Nuerat, نويرات). Radiocarbon dated to 2855–2570 cal. bce, he lived a few centuries after Egyptian unification, bridging the Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom periods. The body was interred in a ceramic pot within a rock-cut tomb1, potentially contributing to the DNA preservation. Most of his genome is best represented by North African Neolithic ancestry, among available sources at present. Yet approximately 20% of his genetic ancestry can be traced to genomes representing the eastern Fertile Crescent, including Mesopotamia and surrounding regions. This genetic affinity is similar to the ancestry appearing in Anatolia and the Levant during the Neolithic and Bronze Age2–5. Although more genomes are needed to fully understand the genomic diversity of early Egyptians, our results indicate that contacts between Egypt and the eastern Fertile Crescent were not limited to objects and imagery (such as domesticated animals and plants, as well as writing systems)6–9 but also encompassed human migration.

 Lung cancer in never smokers (LCINS) accounts for around 25% of all lung cancers1,2 and has been associated with exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke and air pollution in observational studies3–5. Here we use data from the Sherlock-Lung study to evaluate mutagenic exposures in LCINS by examining the cancer genomes of 871 treatment-naive individuals with lung cancer who had never smoked, from 28 geographical locations. KRAS mutations were 3.8 times more common in adenocarcinomas of never smokers from North America and Europe than in those from East Asia, whereas a higher prevalence of EGFR and TP53 mutations was observed in adenocarcinomas of never smokers from East Asia. Signature SBS40a, with unknown cause6, contributed the largest proportion of single base substitutions in adenocarcinomas, and was enriched in cases with EGFR mutations. Signature SBS22a, which is associated with exposure to aristolochic acid7,8, was observed almost exclusively in patients from Taiwan. Exposure to secondhand smoke was not associated with individual driver mutations or mutational signatures. By contrast, patients from regions with high levels of air pollution were more likely to have TP53 mutations and shorter telomeres. They also exhibited an increase in most types of mutations, including a 3.9-fold increase in signature SBS4, which has previously been linked with tobacco smoking9, and a 76% increase in the clock-like10 signature SBS5. A positive dose–response effect was observed with air-pollution levels, correlating with both a decrease in telomere length and an increase in somatic mutations, mainly attributed to signatures SBS4 and SBS5. Our results elucidate the diversity of mutational processes shaping the genomic landscape of lung cancer in never smokers.

 The elemental stoichiometry of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) regulates marine biogeochemical cycles and underpins the Redfield ratio paradigm. However, its global variability and response to environmental change remain poorly constrained. Here we compile a global dataset of 56,031 plankton (particulate) and 388,515 seawater (dissolved) samples from 1971 to 2020, spanning surface to 1,000 m depth, to assess spatial and temporal dynamics in marine C:N:P ratios. We show that planktonic C:P and N:P, and oceanic C:N and C:P ratios, consistently exceed Redfield ratio throughout the study period, indicating widespread deviation from canonical stoichiometry. Planktonic C:N and N:P ratios rose markedly in the late twentieth century, followed by a decline, suggesting a progressive alleviation of P limitation, probably driven by increased anthropogenic P inputs. Depth-resolved patterns show decreasing oceanic C:N and C:P, and increasing N:P ratios with depth, attributable to differential remineralization and microbial nutrient cycling. Our findings highlight dynamic, non-static stoichiometric patterns over decadal scales, offering critical observational constraints for refining the representation of elemental cycling in biogeochemical models and improving projections of marine ecosystem responses to global change.

Here, the authors show that claudin-5 present in non-thermogenic adipocytes regulates thermogenesis and energy expenditure by modulating IL-10 secretion. 
 The claudin protein family plays key roles in maintaining normal structure and function of epithelial and endothelial tight junctions. While several prior studies have addressed the expression of claudin in adipocytes that do not form tight junctions, here we demonstrate that CLDN5 is selectively expressed in non-thermogenic adipocytes within adipose tissue. Ablation of CLDN5 in adipocyte impairs thermogenesis and energy expenditure. CLDN5 deficiency also significantly increases diet-induced fat mass in mice, accompanied with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Mechanistically, CLDN5 affects the subcellular localization of Y-box protein 3, which directly regulates IL10 expression via binding to its promoter and specific sites in 3′-untranslated region, thereby acts in a paracrine manner to signal through IL10R in neighbouring thermogenic adipocytes. These findings expand our understanding about location and function of the extra-tight junction claudin proteins and provide molecular insights into signaling mechanisms underlying adipose thermogenesis that could inform future therapy.

They find a superconducting dome as a function of pressure, with Tc reaching its maximum when the coexisting charge order remains long-range. 
 The interplay between superconductivity and charge or spin order is a key focus in condensed matter physics, with kagome lattice systems providing unique insights. The kagome superconductor LaRu3Si2 (Tc ≃ 6.5 K) features a characteristic kagome band structure and a hierarchy of charge order transitions at Tco,I ≃ 400 K and Tco,II ≃ 80 K, along with an additional transition at T* ≃ 35 K associated with electronic and magnetic responses. Using magnetotransport under pressure up to 40 GPa, we find Tc peaks at 9 K (2 GPa)—the highest among kagome superconductors—remains nearly constant up to 12 GPa, and then decreases to 2 K at 40 GPa, forming a dome-shaped phase diagram. Similarly, both the resistivity anomaly at T* and the magnetoresistance exhibit a dome-shaped pressure dependence. Moreover, above 12 GPa, X-ray diffraction reveals that the charge order evolves from long-range to short-range, coinciding with the suppression of Tc. These observations indicate that superconductivity in LaRu3Si2 is closely linked to the charge-ordered state and the electronic responses at Tco,II and T*.

 A comprehensive understanding of material strength across strain rates typically requires the combination of results from different methods, which often vary in loading conditions and/or sampled volumes, leading to discrepancies in material behavior. This study presents a microindentation approach to measure hardness covering eleven orders of magnitude in strain rate, from quasi-static to phonon drag-dominated rates, on a single material surface under uniform testing conditions. By engineering the geometry of impactors used in laser induced particle impact testing, we extend the breadth of accessible strain rates, including multiple distinct rates exceeding 10⁵ s⁻¹. This self-consistent approach provides clearer insights into high-rate deformation mechanisms. Our results demonstrate a gradual increase in hardness with strain rate from quasi-static up to ultra-high rates, where a sharp upturn in hardness is observed.

 We performed the first in-depth, comparative and prospective biomonitoring of Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients (N = 39) receiving ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel) or idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel) chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR T) in the real-world setting. In cilta-cel patients response rates were higher and atypical neurotoxicities/infections more frequent. Peak CAR T counts were significantly higher in cilta-cel patients, driven by CD4+ CAR expansion, correlating with clinical responses. Expansion of cilta-cel cells was associated with higher CAR and CD27 expression while, in contrast to ide-cel, there was no correlation between TIM3 expression and CAR T proliferation. Cilta-cel CAR T expansion was followed by a CAR-specific switch from proliferation-associated genes to genes/surface markers indicating effector/memory function. The longer persistence of cilta-cel CAR T was associated with increased IL-7R expression; in vitro data showed persistent antigen-independent activation and higher metabolic activity of cilta-cel vs. ide-cel CAR T. Among cilta-cel-treated patients experiencing atypical neurotoxicities, central nervous system (CNS)-infiltrating, effector-type CAR T presented a distinct inflammatory phenotypic/cytokine-expression profile.

Here, the authors identify a bacterial enzyme enabling E. coli to glycosylate IgGs at native sites, thereby advancing therapeutic antibody development in this host. 
 Human immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies are a major class of biotherapeutics and undergo N-linked glycosylation in their Fc domain, which is critical for immune functions and therapeutic activity. Hence, technologies for producing authentically glycosylated IgGs are in high demand. Previous attempts to engineer Escherichia coli for this purpose have met limited success due in part to the lack of oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) enzymes that can install N-glycans at the conserved N297 site in the Fc region. Here, we identify a single-subunit OST from Desulfovibrio marinus with relaxed substrate specificity that catalyzes glycosylation of native Fc acceptor sites. By chemoenzymatic remodeling the attached bacterial glycans to homogeneous, asialo complex-type G2 N-glycans, the E. coli-derived Fc binds human FcγRIIIa/CD16a, a key receptor for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Overall, the discovery of D. marinus OST provides previously unavailable biocatalytic capabilities and sets the stage for using E. coli to produce fully human antibodies.

 To mitigate the necessity for multiple invasive procedures in treating malignant osteosarcoma, an innovative therapeutic approach is imperative to achieve controllable tumor-killing effects and subsequent bone repair. Here, we propose the de novo design of sono-activable and biocatalytic nanoparticles-modified 3D-printed hydroxyapatite (HA) scaffold (HS-ICTO) for intelligently sequential therapies in osteosarcoma eradication and bone defect regeneration. The engineered HS-ICTO scaffold displays superior, spatiotemporally controllable H2O2-catalytic performances, which promptly generate massive reactive oxygen species via multienzyme-like mechanisms coupled with sono-activation, thus augmenting tumor cell apoptosis. Furthermore, HS-ICTO can intelligently switch to catalyze H2O2 to O2 within the inflammatory bone defect microenvironment, effectively blocking endogenous H2O2-mediated oxidative stress, which positively modulates the osteogenic differentiation of stem cells and ultimately facilitates defect regeneration. We validate that this multifaceted HS-ICTO scaffold possesses robust and on-demand abilities to prevent neoplastic recurrence and promote anti-inflammatory osseous tissue repair, representing a promising platform for precision oncological intervention and regenerative medicine.

 Corynebacterium diphtheriae clade species secrete single-domain endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidases (ENGases) that specifically bind to human IgG antibodies and hydrolyze their N297-linked glycans. Here, we define the molecular mechanisms of IgG-specific deglycosylation for the entire family of corynebacterial IgG-specific ENGases, including but not limited to CU43 and CM49. By solving the crystal structure of CU43 in a 1:1 complex with the IgG1 Fc region, combined with targeted and saturation mutagenesis analysis and activity measurements using engineered antibodies, we establish an inter-protomeric mechanism of recognition and deglycosylation of IgG antibodies. Using in silico modeling, small-angle X-ray scattering and saturation mutagenesis we determine that CM49 uses a unique binding site on the Fc region, to process N297-linked glycans. Moreover, we demonstrate that CU43 treatment is highly effective in abrogating Fc effector functions in humanized mouse models, while preserving the neutralizing capacity of anti-influenza IgG antibodies, thereby conferring protection against lethal influenza challenge. Here the authors define an inter-protomeric mechanism of deglycosylation of human IgG antibodies for corynebacterial IgG-specific ENGases and demonstrate that in vivo CU43 treatment preserve the neutralizing capacity of anti-influenza IgG antibodies."

 Low back pain (LBP), primarily driven by intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD), has become a core challenge in public health. DDX1, an RNA-binding protein, plays key roles in RNA metabolism but its function in IVDD remains unclear. We identify DDX1 as a substrate of methyltransferase EZH2, which methylates DDX1 at lysine 234 (K234), promoting IVDD in vitro and in vivo. EZH2 inhibition restores matrix homeostasis in nucleus pulposus (NP) cells and slows IVDD progression. Methylation at DDX1 K234 disrupts its interaction with splicing factors and RNA targets, promoting exon 14 skipping in MATR3. This truncated MATR3 disrupts nuclear architecture, increases chromatin accessibility, and activates signaling pathways such as Wnt, leading to NP cell senescence and apoptosis. Notably, delivery of MATR3-L-overexpressing mRNA via cationic lipid nanoparticles reduces NP cell degeneration and significantly alleviates IVDD, offering important insights into IVDD pathogenesis and potential therapeutic strategies.

 Given that seasonal precipitation predictions over North America are not particularly skillful, assessing whether forecast system refinements can enhance skill and societal usefulness of seasonal forecasts is important. We investigate by using average predictability time (APT) analysis to filter wintertime, seasonal precipitation hindcasts provided by the Seamless System for Prediction and Earth System Research. Using this method, which decomposes forecasts into predictable modes, we find limited potential to improve seasonal precipitation forecasts over North America owing to the subseasonal predictability timescales of most APT modes. Nevertheless, more skillful forecasts of APT mode 2, which is tied to equatorial Pacific convection and has a predictability timescale of about 220 days, may improve seasonal precipitation forecasts over North America. We demonstrate that predictions for the winters of 2015–2016 and 2021–2022, which featured notable forecast errors over western North America, may have been improved with better predictions of this second APT mode."

 Feasting played an important role in cementing social bonds between prehistoric communities. At Early Neolithic Asiab, western Iran, ceremonial feasting is evidenced by the butchered skulls of nineteen wild boars (Sus scrofa), an animal that was not commonly hunted in the region at the time. Here we use microscopic dental growth patterns to guide geochemical analyses of five wild boar teeth from Asiab and examine the geographical scope from which the animals derived. Our dataset includes 165 stable oxygen isotope values, 107 strontium isotope ratios, and Barium concentration maps. The findings indicate that despite Asiab’s location in an environment favourable to wild boars, the animals used for ceremonial feasting originated from a wide geographical catchment, with at least some necessitating transport over substantial distance across mountainous terrain. This deepens our understanding of the effort invested by the participating pre-agricultural communities for celebrating social connectivity across the wider landscape.

 Volcanic ash aggregation occurs during transport in the atmosphere when individual ash particles collide and stick together. It significantly impacts ash residence time in the atmosphere, with major consequences for hazard assessment and ash dispersal forecasts. Nonetheless, aggregation processes are still not adequately parametrized, mostly due to the low preservation potential of most aggregate types. We present here the first, detailed structural and morphological characterization of the major aggregate types, combining an innovative field collection strategy, which allows for the original aggregate structure to be preserved at deposition, coupled to X-Ray micro-tomography. Resulting observations together with weather information, allowed for the structure of fragile ash clusters and of the elusive cored Ash Pellets (cAP1s) to be fully resolved and their genesis to be better described.

 Functional diversity can be assessed remotely from optical sensors using vegetation index-based plant traits. Without effective corrections, employed reflectance values are affected by absorption and scattering processes in the atmosphere and on the ground, which modify radiance and irradiance values used for the reflectance retrieval. Additionally, the anisotropic nature of vegetation canopies induces observation and illumination angle-dependent reflectance variations. Often, however, the reflectance retrieval is not accurate enough to compensate for these effects in the atmosphere and on the surface, resulting in uncertain reflectance values. Furthermore, the effects in retrieved reflectance values propagate into derived products, like the vegetation indices used for calculating functional diversity, where they manifest as apparent differences between temporally close observations of the same area. A key to compensating for these effects lies in the capacity and consideration of several processing steps, such as atmospheric, topographic, and anisotropy correction.To date, it is unknown how these effects and their correction influence the estimation of functional richness. Here, we estimate functional richness based on three differently retrieved reflectance datasets in the overlapping area of three consecutively acquired flight lines with short temporal differences but with three distinct acquisition geometries. We analyze how atmospheric, topographic, and anisotropy effects influence functional richness estimates and how functional richness varies due to different observation and illumination angles.We show that reflectance data before correction for atmospheric, topographic, and anisotropy effects yield up to 15% larger median functional richness estimates compared to data after respective corrections. We discuss under which circumstances comprehensive data processing can reduce between-observation differences. Furthermore, we show that resulting functional richness estimates correlate with the number of shaded pixels (r2 ≈ 0.7). Consequently, observations in the solar principal plane with more or fewer shadows can lead to larger or smaller functional richness estimates and to differences compared to observations perpendicular to the solar principal plane.We conclude with recommendations concerning best-suited data processing and acquisition geometry for reliable and repeatable assessments of functional richness from optical remote sensing data and discuss applications to aerial and space-based observations of functional diversity."

 Urbanization has shaped a dynamic relationship between urban grey and green spaces, and this relationship will profoundly affect the stability and sustainability of the urban system. However, few studies have focused on the complex dynamics, spatial patterns, and dominant factors of the coordination between urban grey and green spaces. Therefore, this study develops a grey-green space trade-offs indicator (GGSCI) to assess the dynamic relationship between vegetated and non-vegetated areas during the growth of urban built-up areas. The GGSCI is implemented to evaluate the long-term dynamics of urban growth across 121 cities in the arid zone of northern China (ANC) from 1990 to 2020. We use Mean-Kendall trend analysis methods to capture the typical features of urban greening, and an interpretable machine learning model is combined to reveal the relative contributions of socioeconomic and natural environment indicators to the GGSCI. The results indicate that: the built-up area of ANC has expanded by 5.72 times from 1990 to 2020. Total grey space growth is 2.12 times that of green space. In addition, the relationship between grey and green spaces in ANC is moving from imbalance to balance, with the percentage of cities in imbalance dropping from a maximum of 23.28 % to 0 %.

 Global warming is expected to increase the frequency of extreme flooding, making rapid and accurate flood mapping crucial for effective risk assessment. Many governmental agencies and organizations are developing flood risk assessment tools; however, due to the lack of observational records, some rely on probabilistic generated data, uncalibrated simulations, or terrain-based methods, all of which are subject to various types of uncertainty. Although remote sensing provides valuable flood data with global coverage, single-source reliance is constrained by satellite revisit rates, resolution, weather conditions, and sensor limitations. To address these challenges, this study introduces a user-friendly application on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform that enables near-real-time global flood mapping using a multi-source remote sensing approach. By leveraging optical and SAR imagery, the App ensures improved water detection accuracy and supports all-weather and day/night monitoring.

By combining high spatial resolution remote sensing emission factors (including satellite-derived aerosol, nighttime light data, vegetation index, land-use types, and impervious surface fraction) with meteorological model data, hourly PM2.5 mass concentration estimates at 1 km spatial resolution over the Sichuan Basin were obtained while maintaining the same level of accuracy as ChinaHighAirPollutants (CHAP) daily scale data.

Accurate retrieval of cloud water droplet distribution is of significant scientific value for improving the accuracy of weather forecasts, understanding feedback mechanisms in the climate system, and optimizing climate model predictions.

Using this approach, the effective particle radius and effective particle variance of water clouds over three surface types: forest, desert/semi-desert, and ocean, were successfully retrieved from the lookup table and polarization reflectance data. The retrieval results under various surface conditions were compared with the MOD06 cloud products. The correlation coefficient between the two sets of water cloud droplet distribution products ranged from 0.74 to 0.82, indicating strong consistency and validating the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed retrieval algorithm.

The results reveal a significant shift around the 1990s: heatwave activity generally declined before this period but has intensified markedly since then. Some dynamic and thermal variables influencing heatwaves have all become more conducive to the occurrence of heatwaves in most parts of China since the 1990s. We analyze the individual and synergistic impacts of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) on the intensification of warm season heatwaves in China. The individual impacts of AMO are through two mechanisms or pathways. ① modulated Rossby waves: it excites an eastward-propagating Rossby wave train from the North Atlantic, forming barotropic anomalous anticyclones over the Tibetan Plateau and the Mongolian Plateau; ② coupled oceanic-atmospheric mechanisms: it enhances the Walker Circulation and further strengthens the Western Pacific subtropical high. IOD are only through Rossby wave trains propagating from the Indian Ocean and the North Atlantic to China. Based on the different phase combinations of AMO and IOD to study their synergistic effects, we found that positive AMO is the primary SST mode driving the heatwave intensification with Rossby waves being the main pathway. IOD plays a secondary role with its positive and negative phases corresponding to different Rossby wave paths in the Indian Ocean. Meanwhile, positive IOD is more strongly associated with the enhancement of Walker circulation."

 The atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and its variation in coastal regions are of great significance for weather forecast and wind energy. Nevertheless, the influence of onshore winds on the ABL height (ABLH) remain poorly understood, largely due to the scarcity of observations. Here, for the first time, we retrieved the daytime ABLH and turbulence dissipation rate (ε) using one-year (2022) worth of wind profiling measurements from eight radar wind profile stations along the southeast coast of China. Afterwards, the spatial and temporal variability of ABLH were investigated, with a focus on the effect of onshore winds on the ABLH. The ABLH follows the same semi-diurnal variation pattern as that of ε. Moreover, the mean ABLH during summer (winter) onshore wind periods is decreases (increases) with the increase of onshore wind intensity. This indicates that the influence of onshore winds on ABLH varies seasonally. In summer, the onshore winds bring the cold marine air masses to the warm land surface, which lowers the temperature inside the ABL and reduces turbulence intensity, thereby suppressing the development of ABLH. By contrast, in winter, the onshore winds caused by temperature difference increase the level of vertical wind shear within the ABL, which enhances the turbulence intensity, thus promoting the development of ABLH. The findings obtained here are useful for understanding the variations of ABLH under different wind conditions in coastal areas."

We identified carboxylation of MAVS by vitamin K (VK)–dependent γ-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX), which was unexpected owing to the reported membrane topology of GGCX. We found that GGCX could undergo topology inversion to carboxylate MAVS within the cytoplasm. This carboxylation enhanced the ability of MAVS to induce type I interferons while suppressing the induction of apoptosis. Genetic knockout of GGCX, a VK-free diet, or depletion of VK by inhibiting VK epoxide reductase 1 with warfarin increased viral susceptibility in mice. Thus, we identified a MAVS regulatory mechanism—the existence of cytoplasmic protein carboxylation and topological inversion of GGCX—and demonstrated how modulating VK levels may influence antiviral defense."

When an anyon excitation is emitted toward a quantum point contact (QPC) in a fractional quantum Hall (FQH) fluid, this memory translates into tunneling events that may occur long after the anyon excitation has exited the QPC.

We developed a spectral analysis–based approach that provides detailed estimates of the timescales at which vegetation tracks climate change, from 101to 105years. We report dynamic similarity of vegetation and climate even at centennial frequencies (149−1to 18,012−1year−1, that is, one cycle per 149 to 18,012 years). A breakpoint in vegetation turnover (797−1year−1) matches a breakpoint between stochastic and autocorrelated climate processes, suggesting that ecological dynamics are governed by climate across these frequencies. Heightened vegetation turnover at millennial frequencies (4650−1year−1) highlights the risk of abrupt responses to climate change, whereas vegetation-climate decoupling at frequencies >149−1year−1may indicate long-lasting consequences of anthropogenic climate change for ecosystem function and biodiversity."
