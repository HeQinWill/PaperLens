For these two specific cases under consideration, LES confirms that early‐morning relative humidity dominates afternoon rain patterns. The attributed impacts are distinct: moisture determines the rain onset timing while temperature affects the peak rain intensity. Single‐pulse day observes one round of strong precipitation and cold pools, which further suppresses convection. On double‐pulse day, the first precipitation peak results from an intermediate development of congestus clouds, whose detrainment leads to a gradual moistening of the lower‐to‐middle troposphere. This behavior of convection favors a second pulse of stronger precipitation with more convective organization, whose development decouples from surface fluxes and sustains until evening."

Together with Asia's Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) launched in 2020 and Europe's upcoming Sentinel‐4, TEMPO contributes to nearly global coverage provided by geostationary satellite constellation. TEMPO and GEMS offer hourly, high‐resolution data of ozone surpassing the once‐daily observations of instruments like the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) in temporal resolution. This study presents TEMPO's total ozone data, demonstrating TEMPO's ability to observe sudden changes in ozone and UV index. Furthermore, TEMPO and GEMS measurements are validated using ground‐based monitoring networks (Brewer, Dobson, and Pandora). Results show good agreement but also highlight latitude‐dependent discrepancies between the satellite and ground‐based data sets (−2% to 2% for TEMPO, −1% to −3% for GEMS). Findings are further validated using TROPOMI data and reanalysis models."

The CESM(WACCM‐X) simulations indicate that increasing levels of CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ weakens the absolute neutral density response at 350 km. However, the relative response is increased with increasing levels of CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$, which is partly due to the decrease in the background neutral density. Due to a weaker response in thermosphere composition and meridional neutral winds, the ionospheric response in absolute terms also weakens with increasing levels of CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$."

Considering its local, dynamically distinct state, we test the hypothesis that the LBE has unique biogeochemical signatures. Using satellite observations and a 12‐year Biogeochemical‐Argo float record, we constructed a climatological view of the annual biogeochemical cycle within and surrounding the LBE. The biological carbon pump influenced by the LBE was less effective than surrounding waters, particularly during late spring. Particulate organic carbon export out of the productive zone was hindered during summer and likely associated with enhanced respiration and slower particle sinking speeds. Enhanced export into the twilight zone was also observed and consistent with shoaling of deep mixed layers in early spring, production of large particles in late summer, and subduction in late autumn; however, these mechanisms appear to be accompanied by enhanced remineralization within the LBE influence zone, highlighting the biogeochemical complexity of eddies."

These interactions result in complex characteristics of rift‐related volcanic features, which may be difficult to interpret considering the different controlling processes. The Turkana Depression (East Africa) exemplifies these complexities, showing an anomalous location of volcanic fields (outside the area of ongoing extension), with variable vent orientation. We analyze vent distribution in the Turkana Depression and calculate the stresses resulting from Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE). Our results show that West to East variations in topography and (subordinately) crustal thickness give rise to extensional GPE‐related stresses East of Lake Turkana, where recent off‐rift volcanism is localized. Within each different volcanic field, local GPE‐related stresses control the arrangement of volcanic vents, which therefore do not respond to the regional (plate motion‐driven) stress field."

L. Johnson,Morphological and Sediment Supply Controls on Lateral Bedrock Channel Erosion,"In bedrock rivers, bedload transport causes abrasion not only vertically but also laterally. Bank erosion causes sinuosity changes and lateral migration that influence terrace formation, hillslope base level and drainage divide evolution. We conducted laboratory experiments and developed equations to predict lateral bedrock abrasion rates, which are poorly understood compared to vertical incision rates. We systematically varied channel curvature, lateral (cross‐stream) bed slope, and the supply rate of bedload. Surprisingly, bank abrasion decreases with increasing channel curvature due to secondary circulation. Bank erosion increases with lateral bed slope because it increases sidewall sediment concentration. However, at higher sediment supply rates lateral erosion is ≈constant due to particle interactions and dynamic cover effects. We propose equations which capture the sensitivity of bank erosion rate to the experimental variables. Our model will be useful for predicting future lateral erosion and for constraining bedload transport rates from bedrock channel morphology."

Ozone deposition is controlled partly by its reactions with marine substances, but in situ evidence of this marine biogeochemical control remains sparse. Here we report a novel measurement of ozone uptake efficiency (OUE) from a trans‐Atlantic cruise (50°N to 45°S). Observed OUE for surface waters varied two‐fold and the implied chemical deposition velocity varied from 0.012 to 0.034 cm s−1. Iodide accounted for on average 2/3 of total OUE, with generally higher contributions in tropical waters. The residual OUE, generally higher in temperate waters and positively correlated with biological proxies, was likely due to marine organics. OUE was also measured for 1,000 m waters, which were likely devoid of iodide but contained biologically refractory organics. Unexpectedly, these waters were rather reactive toward ozone, suggesting that surface organics that affect ozone uptake are not all freshly produced by marine biota."

While Mid‐Infrared channels are used to assess thermal outputs at volcanoes exhibiting effusive activity, Thermal‐InfraRed (TIR) bands are better suited for measuring moderate‐to‐low‐temperature (≲600 K) features, such as those associated with hydrothermal activity. However, failure to meet key assumptions in TIR‐based calculations results in up to a ∼90% RP underestimation of ≲600 K sources. We thus introduce the TIR‐based Volcanic Radiative Power (VRPTIR ${\text{VRP}}_{\text{TIR}}$) method to accurately retrieve RP from single‐band TIR (10.5–12 μm) spectral radiance at systems dominated by surface temperatures of ≲600 K, that is, crater lakes and fumarole fields, achieving an uncertainty of ±35%. Comparison with ground truth for Ruapehu, El Chichón, Taal, Vulcano, Puracé, Poás, and White Island demonstrates the accuracy of VRPTIR ${\text{VRP}}_{\text{TIR}}$ in quantifying thermal output and detecting subtle variations in volcanic activity.

Genesis potential indices (GPIs), which combine key environmental factors, capture the TC seed numbers and spatial distribution but fail to explain SR differences between seasons. Composite analysis reveals that MJ season TC seeds exhibit more intense convection, suggesting additional sources of instability not included in current GPIs, potentially related to horizontal gradient of moisture. These findings highlight the importance of considering both TC seed numbers and SR when investigating TC frequency in the NIO and show GPIs' limitations that focus solely on local environmental variables."

Surprisingly, global observational results show that the downwind enhancement of precipitation caused by large metropolitan areas is weaker under conditions of stronger surface UHIs. This is because stronger UHIs tend to be associated with lower background wind speeds, while the downwind enhancement of precipitation is stronger with higher background wind speeds. These results suggest a competition between thermodynamic and dynamic factors in regulating the downwind enhancement of precipitation, with the background wind speed playing a more important role than the UHI effect. By considering the urban‐rural difference in momentum roughness length, a simple model is utilized to qualitatively explain the link between the downwind enhancement of precipitation and background wind speed."

Our analysis reveals that this event ruptured two conjugate normal faults, likely two boundary faults of a graben structure in the extensional rift. Our best‐fitting slip model includes a large west‐dipping fault and a secondary east‐dipping fault, both characterized by dominant normal slip but with distinct slip amplitude. Relocated aftershocks also reveal that the slip along the secondary east‐dipping fault occurred coseismically rather than postseismically.

To clarify the mechanisms that form and maintain reef passes, we quantify the relationships between reef pass location and drainage basin size in the Society Islands. River basins draining toward reef passes are larger than those draining toward unbroken reef flats, suggesting that rivers help create and sustain reef passes. The correlation between reef passes and large rivers weakens for older islands, suggesting that oceanographic processes increasingly maintain passes as islands age and subside.

Applying to an event on 15 October 2016, the model quantifies the spatial evolution of hiss waves at L = 3.9, which contributes to the steady decay of electron flux observed by Van Allen Probes (VAPs). The model reproduces local‐time dependent features and shows excellent agreement with hiss wave power observed by VAPs. The model shows increased wave power and spatial spread following increased activities in the AL‐index, consistent with previous statistical results. The model also suggests the presence of “low”‐frequency hiss, which was undetected by VAPs, likely masked by instrument noise.

Comparing the global reanalysis ERA5 to its novel Arctic counterpart CARRA for November–March 1991–2020, we investigate the surface turbulent heat fluxes and the spatial characteristics associated with MCAO conditions. We find that the sensible heat flux from the surface to the atmosphere is substantially higher in CARRA while the latent heat flux is higher in ERA5. For sensible heat flux, the differences scale with the magnitude, leading to maximum disagreement over the ice‐free ocean where the heat flux is high. Accounting for the varying heat flux magnitude over different surface types, we find the largest relative disagreement over sea ice. During MCAOs, negative anomalies in temperature and specific humidity are present throughout most of the troposphere in both reanalyses. Over the studied period, sea ice decline has caused positive trends in the surface‐atmosphere potential temperature difference forming the basis of the MCAO index, leading to higher heat fluxes around much of Svalbard. In ice‐free Fram Strait however, both reanalyses show negative trends in the MCAO index and the heat fluxes in January, when the increase in potential temperature is larger at 850 hPa than at the surface.

About 100 events were extracted and analyzed, focusing on the seasonal and interannual variation of the IHC response in the Northern Hemisphere. The seasonal variation can be explained by differences in the background atmosphere. The upward shift and weakening of the gravity wave forcing during the IHC in September are opposite to the characteristics of July and August. However, the mean zonal wind and the momentum deposition of gravity waves in the northern middle atmosphere in September are also opposite to those in July and August. Together, these result in the same sign of the anomaly. Additionally, an interannual variation in the altitude of the warming in the northern polar region is also observed, with warmings split at 100 km. A warming that appears above 100 km is explained by an additional mechanism of gravity wave modulation, which drives the winter‐to‐summer circulation in the lower thermosphere, while a warming below 100 km corresponds to the weakening of the summer‐to‐winter circulation in the upper mesosphere. Correspondingly, no warming is observed near 100 km, where the circulation and its modulation are absent. This interannual variation of the IHC is influenced by the intraseasonal oscillation, which represents a similar meridional temperature structure in the global middle atmosphere."

 Throughout the Last Glacial period, episodic deposition of Ice Rafted Debris marks phases of circum-North Atlantic ice sheet instability. The causes of these Heinrich Events remain contested; while initially attributed to internal ice sheet dynamics, there is a growing consensus that favors external climate forcing. But based on the timing and expression of change, it remains unclear whether this trigger was oceanic or atmospheric. We present data from a High Arctic Lake sediment sequence, whose geochronology was previously published, that suggests Heinrich Event 2 was preceded by atmospheric warming. Alkenone-inferred temperatures, geochemical indicators of stratification and provenance, and leaf wax-based information about moisture availability, all indicate summers warmed from 27.5 to 23.5 thousand years before present. This evidence supports the view that Heinrich Stadials were marked by extreme seasonality rather than year-round cold conditions. Our findings also show that a High Arctic Lake ecosystem existed during the Last Glacial Maximum.

 Gross primary production (GPP) is a key indicator of plant growth and ecosystem health, and accurately capturing its diurnal variation is crucial for understanding vegetation responses to extreme heat and drought. However, the applicability of satellite-based semi-empirical models to diurnal GPP estimation remains limited. This study refined diurnal GPP estimation in humid temperate climates by leveraging Himawari-8/9 geostationary satellite data to incorporate direct/diffuse radiation and the nonlinear GPP response to diurnal variations in absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR). The eddy covariance-light use efficiency (EC-LUE) model was employed by adopting three approaches: the direct/diffuse (DD) setting to consider the direct/diffuse components of APAR, DD with nonlinear relationship (DD-NL) setting to additionally consider the nonlinear GPP-APAR relationship, and the baseline setting. The model was calibrated and validated using the eddy-covariance tower observations from 18 sites across Japan and South Korea. The DD-NL setting improved accuracy by correcting the baseline's overestimation of GPP under high APAR and underestimation under low APAR. Particularly for forest sites, the DD-NL setting reduced midday overestimations by 12–30 % on clear-sky days and morning/afternoon underestimations by 25–40 % on cloudy days. In the baseline setting, low-APAR biases progressively accumulated across daily to annual timescales, whereas the DD-NL setting reduced them to −0.10 g C m−2 day−1 and -51 g C m−2 year−1 (−2.7 % of the site's average GPP). The DD setting had minimal impact in densely vegetated sites. Our findings show that the DD-NL setting in LUE models enhances geostationary satellite-based GPP estimates across diurnal to annual timescales, supporting ecosystem monitoring during extreme events and long-term carbon assessments."

 Aerosols, which offset a third of the greenhouse gas forcing, remain the primary source of uncertainty in climate monitoring. Satellite products, models, or reanalyses provide time series of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), each with distinct strengths and weaknesses. This study evaluates the temporal stability of these datasets from 2003 to 2022 using spatially representative long-term AERONET measurements as a reference.AOD has decreased globally since 2015, driven by anthropogenic emissions reduction in Europe, the US, and particularly in East Asia. Aerosols continue to rise in India due to growing anthropogenic emissions, and in South America due to a shift from declining to increasing organic matter aerosol trends. While all products capture these regional trends, they diverge in terms of magnitude, seasonal variability, and temporal patterns. Only CAMS EAC4 reanalysis reproduces the AOD decrease observed at AERONET stations in Europe and the US with a trend in the bias below 5%/decade. The other products evaluated show drifts above 10%/decade, underestimating the AOD decrease in these regions. MERRA-2 and the C3S multi-satellite products exhibit spurious jumps likely caused by methodological changes. Satellite-based (MODIS and MISR) AOD trends have a positive drift compared to AERONET, potentially due to the use of static aerosol composition datasets. The low satellite revisit time and a calibration drift could also contribute to the MISR spurious trend. An analysis of the reduced temporal sampling of satellites revealed that the impact at the station level is small, suggesting that the drifts found can be attributed to the products. Our results suggest that the aerosol Essential Climate Variable could be better served by reanalysis rather than by direct satellite observations."
10.1016/j.rse.2025.114873,False,Remote Sensing of Environment,这篇论文主要关注的是在多云条件下，如何利用遥感技术重建地表温度。它提出了一种新的地表能量平衡模型（C-SWARM），该模型考虑了云的调节作用，能够更准确地估算多云条件下的地表温度。虽然论文使用了卫星观测数据（GOES-R），但其重点在于地表温度的重建，而不是大气环境遥感，如空气质量监测或大气成分分析。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术的关联性较弱。,"['Land Surface Temperature', 'Cloud Cover', 'Thermal Infrared Remote Sensing', 'Surface Energy Balance', 'GOES-R']",Fei Xu;Xiaolin Zhu,A cloud-regulated land surface warming model to reconstruct daytime surface temperatures under cloudy conditions,"•C-SWARM was developed to estimate hourly daytime LSTs under cloudy conditions. •C-SWARM explains the physical mechanisms of land surface warming. •C-SWARM models the LST as the result of a cloud-regulated surface warming process. •C-SWARM quantifies the regulatory roles of solar and atmospheric factors on LST. 
 Daytime land surface temperature (D-LST) plays a pivotal role in regulating net ecosystem exchanges and is characterized by rapid fluctuations. Thermal infrared satellite remote sensing (TIRS) is widely used to acquire D-LST data owing to its global coverage and high-frequency observations. However, the presence of cloud cover impedes the TIRS technique by obstructing ground thermal emissions. A prevalent solution to this challenge involves correcting clear-sky surface temperatures using the cloud effect which is derived from surface energy balance (SEB) models representing distinct weather conditions. Yet, conventional methods might encounter substantial uncertainties primarily due to the oversimplified SEB modeling, which exacerbates the temperature estimation errors caused by the biases in their employed data products. This study introduces a novel SEB model termed ‘C-SWARM’, designed to reconstruct D-LST under cloudy conditions. The C-SWARM model characterizes D-LST as the result of a cloud-moderated surface warming process, with coefficients indicating the complementary mechanism for solar heating and atmospheric insulation driving surface warming throughout the day. The new model was implemented to fill missing data caused by cloud cover in the LST product of NOAA's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-R), demonstrating a mean absolute error of 2.57 K and accuracy improvements of 0.38 to 1.89 K over benchmark methods at 49 flux tower sites across the contiguous United States. The explicit physical mechanisms make the C-SWARM model a generalized solution for all-weather remote sensing across spatial and temporal scales."

 Hedgerows provide habitat and food for a wide range of species and play a crucial role for biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. In addition, hedgerows render an important carbon stock, above and below ground, and protect agricultural soils from erosion. However, comprehensive, standardized and area wide information regarding the distribution of hedgerows is often lacking, which makes it hard to incorporate them in nature conservation plans and national carbon balance models. We evaluate the potential of high-resolution PlanetScope multitemporal satellite data and semantic segmentation approaches to map the distribution of hedgerows across the entire agricultural landscape in Germany. Based on a comprehensive set of independent reference data from the federal state of Schleswig-Holstein, we evaluate the performance of different loss functions and different combinations of spectral and temporal input feature sets. We assess the transferability of the final model using independent test data from three additional German Federal states. Additionally, we compare our results against the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service High Resolution Layer Small Woody Features, and a recently published biomass map of trees outside forests. All loss functions tested offered similar performance, but the binary-cross entropy function allowed for overcoming sensor artifacts to some extent. Visible and near-infrared imagery from all four monthly mosaics (April, June, August and October) of PlanetScope data was found to yield better results (F1-score 0.65) than different combinations of months and only red-green-blue inputs. We estimate a total surface of 4081 (± 1425) km2 of hedgerows across Germany, which represent 2.3 % of the agricultural land in Germany. By combining our results with a digital landscape model, we reveal heterogenous estimates of hedgerow height across municipalities. Our findings highlight that semantic segmentation approaches are well-suited for area-wide hedgerow mapping, especially in combination with multitemporal high-resolution satellite data. Furthermore, we underscore the relevance of using application-specific models over post-processing existing products, and provide for the first time a spatially explicit and comprehensive overview of the distribution of hedgerows and their structure across agricultural landscapes in Germany. Our methodology and product can be incorporated into landscape biodiversity models, carbon balance estimations and soil protection policies at national, regional and local scale."

 Agriculture forms the backbone of Egypt’s economy, with the Nile Valley and Delta serving as key production zones for crops like wheat, rice, and clover. However, the sector faces mounting pressure from water scarcity, as it depends almost entirely on the Nile for irrigation, making it necessary to map major crops for assessing Water Use Efficiency (WUE) and informing agricultural planning. In this study, we used machine learning (ML) techniques—specifically Support Vector Machine (SVM) to time-series phenological data and optical indices (Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Bare Soil Index (BSI), Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Plant Senescence Reflectance Index (PSRI)) to map major crop types—specifically rice (a summer crop),wheat and clover (winter crops) —across entire Nile Basin in Egypt. Training and testing showed satisfactory performance, with testing accuracy ranging from 0.73 to 0.82 and training accuracy from 0.70 to 0.90. In addition, this study evaluates responsiveness of crop WUE to Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD) and other meteorological and biophysical factors—including solar radiation, precipitation, maximum temperature, gross primary productivity, and evapotranspiration. Our findings confirm VPD as dominant factor affecting WUE, with a 3.5 kPa threshold beyond which WUE no longer responds, signaling a physiological limit for water management. The projected VPD trend, based on ensemble analysis of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 models under SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios, indicates an increase in number of months with high VPD in future, reinforcing the need for adaptive irrigation strategies in the region."

 Building height significantly influences urban development and evolution. Previous studies on building height estimation using digital surface models (DSMs) have predominantly addressed simple, single-environmental scenarios, often yielding unsatisfactory results across diverse environments. This study introduces a novel method for estimating building height by integrating scene classification with spatial geometric relationships. Initially, raw data are processed to derive the various data types required for this approach. Environmental scene classification, based on vegetation and shadows analysis, is then performed. Subsequently, the building height is estimated either directly from the DSM or through road height prediction. The proposed method is validated using a scene image from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The results demonstrate that the estimated building height maintains high accuracy in complex environments with significant vegetation and shadow coverage, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.84 m. Furthermore, the proposed method outperforms existing DSM-based techniques. This approach is adaptable for high-precision building height estimation across various environments and holds substantial application potential, facilitating further research in urban-related scenarios."

Farooq Azam,Thermodynamics of extreme precipitation related to Atmospheric Rivers in two major Himalayan basins,"•Weak ARs (IVT ≤250kg.m−1.s−1, duration ≥18 h) are frequent in Western Himalaya. •Extreme AR-events can cause extreme precipitation with intensities corresponding to 20- and 100-year return periods. •Dynamic changes (convergence) dominate AR-precipitation and intensity. •Frontal lift and orography drives intense AR-precipitation, with localized convection, even under weak instability. •Moisture primarily comes from Arabian Sea, partly from land evaporation and Bay of Bengal. 
 In the extra-tropics, moisture is efficiently transported polewards in the lower troposphere through narrow bands of moisture transport, known as Atmospheric Rivers (ARs). This study identifies ARs that penetrate the southern Himalaya using 6-hourly Integrated Vapor Transport (IVT), and investigates the moisture dynamics, thermodynamics, and moisture sources of the top 8 AR events with substantial precipitation impacts in the Indus Basin (IB) and Ganga Basin (GB), to understand the mechanisms driving extreme AR-related precipitation. Most of these ARs produce over 150 mm/day precipitation (exceeding the 99th percentile of non-zero daily-precipitation) along their central axis and mountain landfall locations, and up to 50 mm/day in the plains. Even the glacierized regions that feed the main basins’ streams receive over 65 mm/day. High-intensity precipitation typically found near southern Himalaya, strongly corresponds to positive moisture convergence and positive advection, with minimal changes in atmospheric moisture content indicating effective translation of AR-moisture to precipitation. Different regions within the ARs experience distinct precipitation mechanisms, with mountains/foothills dominated by orographic uplift even under weak convective conditions, while areas near/on AR-axis are influenced by convective or frontal lifting. The presence of high moisture (IVT), saturated layers, and favourable thermodynamics highlights the ARs' capacity to generate intense precipitation when vertical lift is present. Excess moisture within ARs primarily originates from the Arabian Sea (north, east, and west), followed by Bay of Bengal (north and east), land-based evaporation, and smaller contribution from the Middle Eastern Seas. These case-specific findings demonstrate that ARs are key moisture transport mechanisms to mainland India and the Himalaya, delivering extreme localized precipitation strongly influenced by topography and position of ARs axis. This study offers the first comprehensive understanding of the dynamic and thermodynamic sources of AR moisture, associated precipitation, and the role of the Himalaya in extracting large amounts of moisture from ARs. These findings have important implications for understanding ARs contribution to extreme precipitation in IB and GB, driving mechanisms behind AR-precipitation, and the sources of high moisture content during ARs. These results can help explore potential risks of extreme precipitation, improve AR modeling, and forecasting ARs over these regions."
