10.5194/essd-16-5579-2024,True,Earth System Science Data,这篇论文介绍了WaLiNeAs项目，该项目利用三种激光雷达系统在西地中海沿岸地区对水汽混合比廓线进行了观测。该项目旨在通过获取低层大气水汽变化数据来改进气象预报模型，特别是改善对导致山洪和滑坡等灾害性暴雨事件的预报。论文重点介绍了来自法国团队部署的三台激光雷达在2022年秋季和冬季以及2023年夏季获得的水汽混合比廓线数据集。这些数据具有高时空分辨率，可用于改进数值天气预报。研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它利用激光雷达技术进行大气成分（水汽）的遥感观测，并将其应用于天气预报和灾害预警。,"['water vapor', 'lidar', 'atmospheric composition', 'numerical weather prediction', 'remote sensing', 'heavy precipitation', 'flash flood', 'landslide']",Frédéric Laly;Patrick Chazette;Julien Totems;Jérémy Lagarrigue;Laurent Forges;Cyrille Flamant,Water vapor Raman lidar observations from multiple sites in the framework of WaLiNeAs,"We present a dataset of water vapor mixing ratio profiles acquired during the Water Vapor Lidar Network Assimilation campaign in fall and winter 2022 and summer 2023, using three lidar systems deployed on the western Mediterranean coastline. This innovative campaign provides access to lower-tropospheric water vapor variability to constrain meteorological forecasting models. The scientific objective is to improve forecasting of heavy-precipation events that lead to flash floods and landslides. 
 During the Water Vapor Lidar Network Assimilation (WaLiNeAs) campaign, eight lidars specifically designed to measure water vapor mixing ratio (WVMR) profiles were deployed on the western Mediterranean coast. The main objectives were to investigate the water vapor content during case studies of heavy-precipitation events in the coastal western Mediterranean and assess the impact of high spatiotemporal WVMR data on numerical weather prediction forecasts by means of state-of-the-art assimilation techniques. Given the increasing occurrence of extreme events due to climate change, WaLiNeAs is the first program in Europe to provide network-like, simultaneous and continuous water vapor profile measurements over a period of 3–4 months. This paper focuses on the WVMR profiling datasets obtained from three of the lidars run by the French part of the WaLiNeAs team. These three lidars were deployed in the cities of Coursan, Le Grau-du-Roi and Cannes. This measurement setup enabled monitoring of the water vapor content of the lower troposphere over periods of 3 months in fall and winter 2022, with some interruptions, and 4 months in summer 2023. The lidars measured the WVMR profiles from the surface up to approximately 6–10 km at nighttime and 1–2 km during daytime. They had a vertical resolution of 100 m and a time resolution between 15 and 30 min, and they were selected to meet the needs of weather forecasting with an uncertainty lower than 0.4 g kg−1. The paper presents details about the instruments, the experimental strategy and the datasets provided. The final dataset (https://doi.org/10.25326/537; Chazette et al., 2023) is divided into two sub-datasets: the first with a time resolution of 15 min, which contains a total of 26 423 WVMR vertical profiles, and the second with a time resolution of 30 min to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and signal altitude range."

We implemented five methods to estimate these fluxes over a 5-year period across 47 sites. This is the first dataset representing such large spatial and temporal coverage of soil and plant exchanges, and it has many potential applications, such as examining the response of ecosystems to weather extremes and climate change. 
 Long-term time series of transpiration, evaporation, plant net photosynthesis, and soil respiration are essential for addressing numerous research questions related to ecosystem functioning. However, quantifying these fluxes is challenging due to the lack of reliable and direct measurement techniques, which has left gaps in the understanding of their temporal cycles and spatial variability. To help address this open challenge, we generated a dataset of these four components by implementing five (conventional and novel) approaches to partition total evapotranspiration (ET) and CO2 fluxes into plant and soil fluxes across 47 National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) sites. The final dataset (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12191876; Zahn and Bou-Zeid, 2024) spans a 5-year period and covers various ecosystems, including forests, grasslands, and agricultural terrain. This is the first comprehensive dataset covering such a wide spatial and temporal distribution. Overall, we observed good agreement across most methods for ET components, increasing confidence in these estimates.  Partitioning of CO2 components, on the other hand, was found to be less robust and more dependent on prior knowledge of water use efficiency. This highlights some limitations of these present methods that we discuss, emphasizing the broader challenge posed by the lack of an accurate reference method to validate against. Despite these limitations, this dataset has several potential applications, especially in addressing critical questions regarding the response of ecosystems to extreme weather events, which are expected to become more severe and frequent with climate change."

Treat,An expert survey on chamber measurement techniques for methane fluxes,"Methane is a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming, but we do not fully understand how much is released from natural sources like wetlands. To measure methane over large areas, many measurements are needed, often from small chambers that are placed on the ground. However, different researchers use different measurement setups, making it hard to combine data. We surveyed 36 researchers about their methods, summarized the responses, and identified ways to make the data more comparable. 
 Methane is an important greenhouse gas but the magnitude of global emissions in particular from natural sources remain highly uncertain. To estimate methane emissions on large spatial scales, methane flux data sets from field measurements collected and processed by many different researchers must be combined. We hypothesize that considerable uncertainty might be introduced into such data synthesis products by the many different approaches used to collect, process and quality control chamber measurements of methane fluxes within the flux community. Existing guidelines on chamber measurements promote more standardized measurement and processing techniques but to our knowledge, so far, no study has investigated which methods are actually used within the flux community. Therefore, we aimed to identify major differences between the approaches for chamber methane fluxes used by different researchers."

Grodsky,Immediate Effect of Floating Solar Energy Deployment on Greenhouse Gas Dynamics in Ponds,"Floating photovoltaic (FPV) solar energy offers promise for renewable electricity production that spares land for other societal benefits. FPV deployment may alter greenhouse gas (GHG) production and emissions from waterbodies by changing physical, chemical, and biological processes, which can have implications for the carbon cost of energy production with FPV. Here, we use an ecosystem-scale experiment to assess how GHG dynamics in ponds respond to installation of operationally representative FPV. Following FPV deployments of 70% array coverage, daily whole-pond GHG emissions increased by 26.8% on a carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2-eq) basis, and dissolved oxygen availability rapidly decreased. Despite increased emissions following FPV deployment, FPV-derived GHG emissions from waterbodies are likely lower than landscape GHG emissions associated with terrestrial solar and hydropower production on a CO2-eq kWh–1 basis. Adaptive management strategies like bubbler installation may reduce the magnitude of FPV impacts on GHG and dissolved oxygen dynamics."

However, its efficiency in removing other biological pollutants, such as human bacterial pathogens (HBPs) and virulence factor genes (VFGs), is rarely studied. Herein, by pyrolyzing rice straw (RS) and pine wood (PW) at 350 and 700 °C, we prepared a series of biochar (RS350, RS700, PW350, and PW700) and investigated their impacts on the abundance and pathogenicity of HBPs. Compared with PW biochar, RS biochar effectively reduced the abundance of HBPs by 6.3–40.1%, as well as their pathogenicity, evidenced by an 8.2–10.1% reduction in the abundance of VFGs. Mechanistically, more persistent free radicals (PFRs) were formed in RS biochar than that of PW biochar during pyrolysis, and PFRs triggered the degradation of N-butyryl-l-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL) from 1.05 to 0.68 ng/kg, thereby disturbing the quorum sensing (QS) of HBPs. Once the QS was disturbed, the communications among HBPs were hindered, and their virulence factors were reduced, which ultimately lowered the abundance and pathogenicity of HBPs. Collectively, our study provides insights into the role of biochar in decreasing the risks of HBPs, which is significant in the development of biochar-based technologies for soil remediation."

However, it is challenging to identify multiple toxicants in complex water bodies concurrently. This research developed an innovative biosensor detection strategy combined with machine learning. To simultaneously quantify and qualitatively predict the presence of each toxin in a multitoxic system, we developed a prediction model (MEA-ANN) based on machine learning analysis of EABs by analyzing the electrochemical toxicity response parameters of various toxicants (Cd2+, Cr6+, triclosan, and trichloroacetic acid). Furthermore, the mean impact value was utilized to filter the characteristic response parameters of toxicants, enhancing the prediction accuracy and efficiency of the model. The optimized model (OMEA-ANN) demonstrated strong performance in predicting target toxicants within interference systems containing analogs. The practicability and feasibility of this model were validated using seven real water samples and spiked natural water samples, achieving R2 > 0.9. The novel, eco-friendly, and intelligent water ecological risk early warning strategy presented in this paper addresses the limitations of traditional EAB sensors. It expands the applicability of EAB sensors for detecting multiple toxicants in water, significantly advancing their role in water quality monitoring. This approach provides valuable insights for the intelligent management of sewage."

These risks propagate both along the life cycle and across national boundaries in a multilayer network. However, most previous studies are either only based on static network measures or focused on individual layers, ignoring dynamic cascading risks and interconnected and interdependent relationships along life cycle stages and across economies. Here, we integrated trade-linked material flow and complex network analyses to investigate intricate interconnections, interdependencies, and systematic risks of the global lithium supply chain. Both static and dynamic measures of the global lithium supply chain network exhibit a “robust-yet-fragile” property: robust for random shocks yet fragile for targeted shocks and robust for small or local disruptions yet fragile for large or cascading failures. Portugal, Brazil, Singapore, Canada, Finland, Norway, South Africa, Israel, Hungary, and the United Arab Emirates are most likely to be affected by supply disruptions. A hypothetical USA-China trade decoupling will increase the severity and susceptibility of network-wide failures by around 5%. Our results call for global collaborations and collective efforts to balance efficiency and security and avoid a “zero-sum game” in securing the lithium supply chain."

While basal water and subglacial drainage configuration are thought to drive glacier speedups across these timescales, it remains unclear whether this forcing always occurs through the same mechanisms.

We simulate velocity oscillations that range from seasonal to >100 ${ >} 100$ years. Our model results more closely resemble observations of surges than previous model versions because ice flow variability at seasonal and multi‐year timescales is reproduced simultaneously through hydrological forcing. Under favorable conditions, seasonal water delivery to the bed gradually accumulates in a poorly‐connected basal drainage system, priming the glacier to surge. Surges themselves are marked by high water fluxes and enthalpy drainage from the glacier base."

Here, we find that such AO–SCWP relationship is nonstationary and controlled by the remote Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). Especially, the relationship between positive AO and SCWP is significantly weakened during the warm phase of AMO. Observational analyses and idealized Atlantic pacemaker simulations indicate that warm AMO forcing is accompanied by a teleconnection wave train extending eastward from the North Atlantic to West Pacific and the western North Pacific sea surface temperature warming, which together induce northerly wind anomalies over South China by enhancing the land–ocean pressure gradient. Such climate background state changes associated with the warm AMO prohibit the positive AO induced water vapor transport to South China, thereby weakening the AO–SCWP relationship."

Through the obvious variation of the eastward‐propagating MJO speed, it also shows the possible close relationship between the mean SST state and the interdecadal variability in intraseasonal zonal wind.

Interlinked flux tubes will form only if the x‐line is short; when the x‐line is long enough, the regular flux ropes are formed instead.

However, atmospheric radiative transfer calculations are computationally expensive, especially when involving multiple‐scattering calculations in cloudy areas. In recent years, deep learning (DL) models have been increasingly applied to emulate and accelerate physical models. This study, for the first time, explores DL techniques to emulate all‐sky radiative transfer in microwave bands. The FengYun‐3E (FY‐3E) Microwave Humidity Sounder‐2 (MWHS‐2) was selected as the target instrument due to its comprehensive spectral coverage, with the radiative transfer for TOVS scattering module (RTTOV‐SCATT) serving as the reference model. Three DL architectures were trained and compared, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), Bidirectional Long Short‐Term Memory with Attention (BiLSTM‐Attention), and Transformer. The BiLSTM‐Attention architecture demonstrated superior performance in both clear‐sky and cloudy radiance simulations. This may be attributed to its bidirectional recurrent structure resembling physical radiative transfer processes and the attention mechanism's ability to link MWHS‐2 channels with corresponding vertical layers. Although DL models achieve high accuracy in forward prediction, they often struggle with instability in Jacobian calculations. To address this issue, the trained BiLSTM‐Attention model was fine‐tuned using the reference model Jacobians as physical constraints. The fine‐tuned BiLSTM‐Attention model accurately characterized radiance sensitivities to temperature, water vapor, and hydrometeors under different cloud conditions, indicating its potential to serve as a radiance observation operator in data assimilation and physical retrieval applications."

The safety of ships navigating along these routes will be severely threatened by low visibility caused by Arctic sea fog. Here, we utilize ship and coastal site observations spanning 1979–2023 to investigate the climatological features and mechanisms of Arctic sea fog from June to September. We find that the Northern Sea Route (NSR, along the Russian coast) experiences a mean fog frequency of 20.0%, significantly higher than the 11.5% fog frequency observed along the Northwest Passage (NWP, along the Canadian coast). Fog frequency shows null correlation with sea ice but a strong negative correlation (−0.80) with surface air temperature. The lower mean surface air temperature in the NSR region enhances relative humidity and atmospheric stability, which are conducive to fog formation and maintenance. We further reveal that fog formation mechanisms differ between the NSR and NWP. Along the NSR, fog is usually advection fog, associated with upper boundary layer warming and moistening; in contrast, along the NWP, fog is typically radiation fog linked to near‐surface cooling. Our study highlights the distinct fog frequency and dominant mechanisms along the different trans‐Arctic shipping routes, thereby establishing observed reference for the model validation of simulating Arctic sea fog."

There is a need to manage the WEF nexus to meet rapidly increasing demands, but this is extremely challenging due to resource scarcity and climate change. If countries that rely on shared transboundary water resources have contradictory WEF plans, that could diminish the expected outcomes, both nationally and regionally. Egypt as the most downstream Nile country is concerned about ongoing and future developments upstream, which could exacerbate Egypt's water scarcity and affect its ability to meet its WEF objectives. In this context, we introduce a multi‐model WEF framework that simulates the ENB water resources, food production, and hydropower generation systems. The models were calibrated and validated for the period 1983–2016, then utilized to project a wide range of future development plans, up to 2050, using four performance measures to evaluate the WEF nexus. A thematic pathway for regional development that shows high potential for mutual benefits is identified.

 This study introduces an Entropy-based index: the Lorenz-entropy (LE) index, which we have developed by integrating Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR), econometrics, and forest ecology. The main goal of the LE is to bridge the gap between theoretical entropy concepts and their practical applications in monitoring vertical structural complexity of tropical forest ecosystems. The LE index quantifies entropy by analyzing Relative Height (RH) metrics (representing a one-dimensional (1D) canopy structure metric) distributions from full-waveform LiDAR across successional stages in a tropical dry forest (TDF) and a tropical rainforest. To validate the LE trends derived from LiDAR, we extended the analysis using inventory-based two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) metrics, specifically basal area and biomass. The consistency of trends between the 1D LiDAR-derived LE and the inventory-based 2D and 3D metrics reinforces the LE's ability to capture and monitor structural complexity reliably across different measurement dimensions.Our findings demonstrated that LE captures the changes in entropy as a function of successional stages, reflecting how canopy structure evolves towards homogeneity and complexity. Our statistical analysis revealed significant differences between successional stages (ANOVA, α = 0.05, p < 2e-16), with LE increasing substantially from early to late stages and plateauing at climax, where vertical structure (entropy) stabilizes. The mean LE increased by 1.70×10−2 between late and climax stages, with a small effect size (Cohen's d = 0.25), indicating minor differences in complexity. The LE index, calculated from biomass and basal area, confirming that as forests mature, entropy and vertical structural complexity increase. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis showed that LE is most responsive to RHs variability during intermediate stages, suggesting that structural development is most dynamic during this phase. These results demonstrate the potential of the LE index as a tool for ecological analysis and monitoring forest dynamics."

 Under the background of climate change and global warming, extreme drought events in China are becoming increasingly frequent. Drought is one of the primary natural causes of damage to China’s agriculture, economy, and environment, making timely, accurate, and high-resolution drought monitoring particularly crucial. The global standardized precipitation − evapotranspiration index database (SPEIbase) is a widely accepted and used global-scale drought monitoring product. However, limited by its spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees, it is difficult to describe the local spatio-temporal structure of drought. How to improve its spatial resolution while maintaining spatio-temporal consistency is one of the current research hotspots. Based on the response of vegetation growth status to drought, this paper proposes a simple and feasible SPEI prediction method, which improves the resolution of SPEIbase from 0.5 degrees to 1 km. Sixteen remote sensing inversion indices, reflectance and elevation data related to drought were selected from Google Earth Engine (GEE) as features. After preprocessing such as gridding and sample balancing, a random forest regression model was constructed to achieve high spatial resolution prediction of SPEI. SPEI with time scales of 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 months in July 2020, August 2019 and August 2018 in China was selected for experiments. The accuracy of 1 km resolution SPEI was evaluated through metrics such as root mean square error (RMSE), Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and determination coefficient (R2). At the same time, it was compared with the existing 1 km resolution SPEI dataset and the site-scale SPEI values. The results show that the method in this paper can obtain accurate prediction results more stably. The PCC and R2 of different months and multiple time scales are all higher than 0.9 and 0.8, and the RMSE is lower than 0.4, showing a good application prospect. Despite the good consistency between the Proposed SPEI and SPEIbase with the site-scale SPEI values, there is still significant room for improvement."

 Recently Guangzhou and Foshan in China are experiencing significant urbanization and economic development. However, the accelerated urbanization process has contributed significantly to urban land subsidence, causing huge economic losses and endangering safety of infrastructure. This intricate activities on urban surfaces can also lead to pseudo danger in interpreting InSAR-based urban surface deformation, resulting in hazard misidentification in two cities. In order to more accurately identify the hazard of urban surface deformation, we innovatively present a combination of InSAR technology with multi-temporal optical remote sensing data. It can also analyze the specific causes of urban deformation at SAR pixel level in two cities. The SBAS-InSAR method was adopted to obtain an urban subsidence map from 2017 to 2020 based on 110 Sentinel-1 SAR image scenes. To obtain an urban surface change map with a high accuracy, an improved SwiT-UNet++ model was applied based on multi optical Google Earth imagery. By a combined analysis of SAR and optical images, we discovered multiple irregular funnels with subsidence at different scales in both cities, that are mostly relatable to urban surface constructions such as foundation compression, building demolition, and the construction of public facilities. Furthermore, to identify detailed hazard around surface changes, the buffer analysis based on InSAR surface deformation and urban surface change maps was conducted. It revealed the surface deformation signals around certain urban surface change areas are more obvious and pose certain hazard. Finally additional high-risk areas are found in the two cities. By subtracting the optical surface change detection map from the InSAR-based urban subsidence map, the “pseudo danger” caused by urban activities in the interpretation of InSAR-based urban surface deformation is eliminated, enabling precise identification of actual land subsidence hazards. It is realized through a risk assessment experiment in the research area by adding factors of urbanization processes. By combining multiple sources of data and using advanced analytical techniques, we could identify the determining factors contributing to urban subsidence and the detailed hazards and thus, provide valuable information for future urban developments."

 Glacier velocity is one of the crucial parameters in the research of glacier dynamics. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR), as an active microwave sensor, represents a common method to monitor glacier velocity. However, the changes of glacier surface could cause the data missing of glacier velocity due to incoherence. To meet the demand for glacier velocity monitoring, this paper employs the SAR images of Sentinel-1 in long time series and optical images of Sentinel-2 to investigate the velocity of Petermann glacier in 2021. Firstly, the time series of glacier velocity in the whole year of 2021 is obtained by using SAR images. The glacier velocity extracted from the optical image pairs is used as the initial value of the large missing part of the glacier velocity field. Then the spatiotemporal glacier velocity matrix is constructed and empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis is carried out. Among them, the glacier velocity is reconstructed by the glacier velocity estimation method based on confidence, and the complete glacier velocity time series is obtained by iterating to minimize the error of the reconstructed glacier velocity. Finally, the obtained time series of Petermann Glacier velocity in 2021 were statistically analyzed. The statistical results quantified the seasonal differences of Petermann Glacier. In addition, the analysis results show that the temporal and spatial variations of Petermann Glacier velocity are affected by topography and temperature."

 Acute exposure effects of short-wavelength solar ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation can trigger skin-based diseases and eye health ailments in humans and animals, as well as disrupt photosynthetic or hormonal systems in plants. Within the UV wavebands, high levels of UV-B exposure are particularly severe and the leading cause of skin cancers. Therefore, accurate and explainable short-term UV-B forecasts are essential for effectively providing sun exposure information to the public and UV experts. To address this pressing issue, we developed an explainable hybrid TabNet framework optimized with the Optuna algorithm. The model was trained using predictors derived from satellite products and sky images for the experimental site in Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia. For model training, 3,863 data points were utilized from July 1, 2002 to February 29, 2004.

Explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) results, based on Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), indicate that the antecedent lagged memory of UV-B radiation and the solar zenith angle contribute significantly to UV-B predictions. Ozone effects and cloud cover conditions are also influential features in this respect.

This SST cooling triggers a teleconnection atmospheric wave train, traversing Eurasia, the northern Pacific and the northern America and reaching the northern Atlantic. The associated anomalous cyclone over mid-latitude northern Atlantic is accompanied by anomalous southwesterly winds over the subtropics, leading to SST warming in the subtropical northern Atlantic through weakening total wind speed and upward surface latent heat flux. SST warming in the subtropical northern Atlantic extends southward into the tropical Atlantic via wind-evaporation-SST feedback during the subsequent summer and autumn, which induces an anomalous zonal-vertical circulation with descending motion over the ENP. This descending motion reduces relative humidity and weakens local convection over the ENP, and thus is unfavorable for TC genesis there. This study suggests that the spring GB SIC could serve as a potential predictor of JJASON ENP TC genesis."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2024.107843,True,Atmospheric Research,这篇论文研究了天津地区重污染过程中三维气象条件对PM2.5浓度的影响。研究发现，风速与PM2.5浓度在垂直方向上呈现反向趋势，弱风条件下PM2.5浓度峰值出现，强风有利于污染物扩散。稳定边界层、逆温层、高湿度以及风速的均匀分布等气象条件导致PM2.5浓度持续升高。此外，来自北京和保定地区的区域传输是天津地区PM2.5浓度出现两次峰值的主要原因。该研究强调了在污染物减排背景下，三维气象条件是重污染发生的关键因素。虽然文章没有直接提及具体的遥感技术，例如卫星观测或传感器类型，但其研究结果对改进大气环境遥感技术，特别是利用遥感数据反演PM2.5浓度和气象参数，以及进行区域空气质量模拟具有重要参考价值。,"['PM2.5', 'air quality monitoring', 'haze', 'meteorological patterns', 'boundary layer', 'wind speed', 'thermal inversion', 'air pollution', 'regional transport modeling']",Miaomiao Lu;Suqin Han;Xiao Tang;Xueshun Chen;Kexin Liu;Jing Ding;Tianyi Hao;Zifa Wang,Investigate the important role of 3-D meteorological patterns in haze formation in the context of pollution reduction,"•PM2.5profiles characteristics in Tianjin influenced by 3-D meteorological patterns. •Wind speed with height showing an almost opposite trend to PM2.5. •Two regional sources determining the occurrence of two surface PM2.5peaks. 
 Since 2013, heavy pollution episodes have occurred frequently over the North China Plain after unprecedented efforts to reduce primary pollutants. In this study, a pollution process in Tianjin, a typical city in North China, was selected to investigate the impact of 3-D meteorological patterns on PM2.5 and meteorological element profiles obtained by tethered balloons and meteorological towers. The pollution episode lasted 4 days with hourly PM2.5 concentrations exceeding 150 μg·m−3 for 81 h and a peak concentration of 377 μg·m−3. In the early stages of the first pollution period, wind speed with height showed an almost opposite trend to PM2.5 concentrations. In the vertical direction, weak winds were frequently accompanied by PM2.5 peaks, whereas strong winds were favourable for the diffusion of pollutants. In the later stage, a stable boundary layer with a height of approximately 600–700 m, thermal inversion layer capping the boundary layer, uniformly high-humidity atmosphere (>80 %), and relatively uniform distribution of wind speed across heights contributed to the high PM2.5, which remained within the boundary layer, and the continuous growth of surface PM2.5 concentrations. In the secondary pollution period, the successive regional transport of particles from Beijing and Baoding was the main reason for the two surface PM2.5 peaks in Tianjin. Different regional sources elevate PM2.5 levels, further extending the duration of haze pollution. The results reveal that 3-D meteorological conditions are the key reason for heavy pollution occurrence in the context of pollution reduction."
