This review examines how background O3 is defined and estimated, revealing significant variations across China, with higher level in the Northwest and lower in the Northeast region. Globally, China’s background O3 levels are medium-to-high and rising. The study calls for integrated estimation methods, international collaboration, and research on climate-ozone links to improve air quality strategies. 
 Background ozone (O3) represents the baseline concentrations in the absence of local anthropogenic emissions and is critical for understanding and mitigating tropospheric O3 pollution. Accurate estimation of background O3 constrains the maximum achievable benefits of precursor emissions control and informs effective air quality management. This review synthesizes the definition and estimation methods for background O3, including in situ measurement, statistical analysis, numerical modeling, and integrated methods. A meta-analysis of background O3 in China from 1994 to 2020 reveals pronounced spatial variability, with concentrations ranging from 33 ppb in the Northeast China to 48 ppb in the Northwest China, and a national mean of 41 ppb, accounting for 79 % of the tropospheric maximum daily 8 h average O3. Methodological discrepancies are evident for background O3: in situ and statistical methods yield higher estimates, whereas integrated approaches produce lower yet more consistent values. Placed in a global context, background O3 levels in China are medium-to-high and exhibit an increasing trend. This review highlights the need for integrated estimation methods to improve accuracy, underscores the international collaboration to address long-range pollutant transport, and calls for further research on the interactions between background O3 and climate change. By advancing the understanding of background O3 dynamics, it provides critical insights for atmospheric chemistry and air pollution control in China and beyond."

Vogel;Yafang Cheng;Stephan Borrmann,Transport of Biomass Burning Aerosol into the Extratropical Tropopause Region over Europe via Warm Conveyor Belt Uplift,"We show measurements of a filament with biomass burning influence transported by a warm conveyor belt (WCB) into the tropopause region over Europe. The pollution originates from Canadian forest fires and is transported in the lower troposphere towards Europe. The WCB transport is followed by mixing with air masses of stratospheric chemical signatures. We hypothesize that this mixing leads to a change in the vertical gradient of the potential temperature. 
 We present measurements from the aircraft-based TPEx (Tropopause composition gradients and mixing Experiment) mission in June 2024 over Europe. The measurement platform, a Learjet 35A, was equipped with in-situ trace gas and aerosol measurements and filter samplers for offline analysis. For vertical gradient measurements of trace species and aerosol, we conducted redundant measurements on a fully automated towed sensor shuttle (TOSS) 200 m below the aircraft. On 17 June 2024, we observed a filament with elevated aerosol number concentrations of up to 800 particles cm−3 between 100 nm and 1 µm. This is higher by a factor of two to four than the local background. Carbon monoxide (CO) mixing ratios were larger than 100 ppbv. Single particle analysis of impactor samples using electron microscopy show characteristic biomass burning (BB) aerosol in the tropopause region. The TOSS measurements also allow the calculation of the potential temperature gradient (Δθ⋅Δz-1). Within the polluted filament, we observe changes towards smaller gradients, which is presumably due to an increase of potential temperature at lower altitudes by radiative heating as a consequence of the transported BB aerosol. Trajectory analysis show air mass origin over Canada with low-level long-range transport and subsequent uplift by a warm conveyor belt (WCB) over Europe as additional pathway of pollution into the UTLS. Furthermore, this analysis yields that BB aerosol can be transported in a WCB into the UTLS there it can be mixed with stratospheric air masses."

Our method shows consistent results with previous studies but also provide new information about possible bimodality of the ASMA and inter-annual decrease of the ASMA area. 
 The definition of the boundary of the Asian summer monsoon anticyclone (ASMA) in the upper troposphere-lower stratosphere (UTLS) (350–410 K) is a known challenge that highly impacts the information about the anticyclone's behavior and affects the results when studying of its interannual variability.  We present a novel method based on the absolute vortex moments that defines the ASMA boundary by solving an optimization problem. Here, we address the ASMA's climatology (1980–2023), interannual variability, the variability of the start and end dates and the duration of the anticyclone peak phase calculated with help of the defined novel method by using the ERA5 reanalysis provided by ECMWF. In addition, three individual years – 2017, 2022 and 2023 are highlighted during which aircraft campaigns took place to measure air inside the ASMA or its outflow (StratoClim, ACCLIP, PHILEAS). The interannual analysis is based on the anticyclone's centroid latitude and longitude, excess kurtosis, angle and aspect ratio using four isentropic surfaces: 350, 370, 390 and 410 K. Our findings show that the ASMA area decreases at 370, 390 and 410 K over the period 1980–2023 in contrast to previous studies. Further, we provide evidence of possible bimodality of the ASMA where the spatial distribution shows clustering of high-magnitude values (the Montgomery streamfunction values minus an optimized background value) around two centers on climatological data over 44 years as well as counting the number of days when two anticyclones (or two modes) where found simultaneously."

Ruby Leung;Peter Caldwell;Susannah Burrows,Prescribing the aerosol effective radiative forcing in the Simple Cloud-Resolving E3SM Atmosphere Model v1,"Our study assesses the aerosol effective radiative forcing in a global cloud-resolving atmosphere model at ultra-high resolution. We demonstrate that global aerosol forcing signal can be robustly reproduced across resolutions when aerosol activation processes are carefully parameterized. Further, we argue that simplified prescribed aerosol schemes will open the door for further process/mechanism studies under controlled conditions. 
 Aerosol effective radiative forcing critically influences climate projections but remains poorly constrained. Using the Simple Cloud-Resolving E3SM Atmosphere Model (SCREAM) v1 configuration, we assess the sensitivity of the radiative forcing due to anthropogenic aerosol changes using a simplified prescribed aerosol scheme (SPA) derived from E3SM v3. Nudged simulations at 3 and 12 km horizontal grid spacings reveal a more negative aerosol forcing than the reference 100 km E3SM v3 whence the SPA properties are derived. The resulting globally averaged aerosol forcing signal is largely due to aerosol–cloud interactions and exhibits little overall resolution sensitivity, while hints of resolution sensitivity appear regionally between the 3 and 12 km runs. While the default SPA scheme overestimates cloud droplet dependence on aerosols, parameterization adjustments in the activation process reconcile forcing estimates with the reference model. Our results demonstrate the ability to use a prescribed aerosol scheme to hold aerosol forcing to a desired strength across resolutions."

Shupe;Susanne Crewell;Harald Sodemann;Vera Schemann,Observed and modeled Arctic airmass transformations during warm air intrusions and cold air outbreaks,"Aircraft observations of air parcels moving into and out of the Arctic are reported. From the data, heating and cooling as well as drying and moistening of the air masses along their way into and out of the Arctic could be measured for the first time. These data are used to evaluate if weather prediction models are able to accurately represent these air mass transformations. This work helps to model the future Arctic climate changes, which may have an impact for mid-latitude weather as well. 
 Profiles of thermodynamic and cloud properties and their transformations during Arctic Warm Air Intrusions (WAIs) and Cold Air Outbreaks (CAOs) were observed during an aircraft campaign, and simulated using the ICON weather prediction model. The data were collected along flight patterns aimed at sampling the same air parcels multiple times, enabling Eulerian and quasi-Lagrangian measurement-model comparisons and model process studies. Within the Eulerian framework, the temperature profiles agreed well with the ICON output although a small model bias of −0.9 K was detected over sea ice during CAOs. Also, the air parcels did not adjust to the changing surface skin temperature quickly enough. The specific humidity profiles were reproduced by ICON with mean deviations of 6.0 % and 19.5 % for WAIs and CAOs, respectively. Radar reflectivities based on ICON output captured the vertical cloud distributions during the airmass transformations. The simulated process rates of temperature and humidity along the trajectories showed that adiabatic processes dominated the heating and cooling of the air parcels over diabatic effects during both WAIs and CAOs. Of the diabatic processes, latent heating and turbulence had a stronger impact on the temperature process rates than terrestrial radiative effects, especially over the warm ocean surface during CAOs. Finally, a quasi-Lagrangian observation-model comparison was performed. For WAIs, the observed change rates of temperature and humidity were not perfectly captured in the simulations. For the CAOs, the calculated heating and moistening change rates of the airmasses were well represented by ICON with remaining deviations close to the surface."
10.5194/acp-25-15121-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究利用卫星数据和先进的建模方法，对中国和山西省的人为甲烷排放进行了高分辨率的反演。研究发现，中国2022年的甲烷排放量低于之前的估计，特别是在煤炭开采和废弃物处理领域。反演显著降低了排放的不确定性，并改善了甲烷浓度的模拟结果。这项研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它使用了卫星观测数据（TROPOMI）来监测大气成分（甲烷），并应用于空气质量监测和温室气体排放的反演研究，为气候变化减缓策略提供了重要参考。,"['Methane emissions', 'Satellite data', 'TROPOMI', 'Atmospheric composition', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Emission inversion', 'Greenhouse gas', 'Climate mitigation']",Shuzhuang Feng;Fei Jiang;Yongguang Zhang;Huilin Chen;Honglin Zhuang;Shumin Wang;Shengxi Bai;Hengmao Wang;Weimin Ju,High-resolution regional inversion reveals overestimation of anthropogenic methane emissions in China,"Using satellite data and advanced modeling, this study inverted daily high-resolution anthropogenic CH4 emissions across China and Shanxi Province. We found that China's 2022 CH4 emissions were 45.1 TgCH4·yr⁻¹, significantly lower than previous estimates, especially in coal mining and waste sectors. The inversion substantially reduced emission uncertainties and improved CH4 concentration simulations. These results suggest China’s climate mitigation burden may have been overestimated. 
 Methane (CH4), the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas, significantly impacts global warming. As the world's largest anthropogenic CH4 emitter, China faces challenges in accurately estimating its emissions. Top-down methods often suffer from coarse resolution, limited data constraints, and result discrepancies. Here, we developed the Regional Methane Assimilation System (RegGCAS-CH4) based on the WRF-CMAQ model and the EnKF algorithm. By assimilating extensive TROPOMI column-averaged dry CH4 mixing ratio (XCH4) retrievals, we conducted high-resolution nested inversions to quantify daily CH4 emissions across China, with a focus on Shanxi Province in 2022. Nationally, posterior CH4 emissions were 45.1 ± 3.8 TgCH4 yr−1, 36.5 % lower than the EDGAR estimates, with the largest reductions in the coal and waste sectors. In North China, emissions decreased most significantly, mainly attributed to the coal and enteric fermentation sectors. Posterior emissions in coal-reliant Shanxi Province decreased by 46.3 %. Sporadic emission increases were detected in major coal-producing cities but were missed by the coarse-resolution inversion. Monthly emissions exhibited a winter-low, summer-high pattern, with the rice cultivation and waste sectors showing higher seasonal increases than those in EDGAR. The inversion significantly improved XCH4 and surface CH4 concentration simulations, reducing emission uncertainty. Compared to other bottom-up/top-down estimates, our results were the lowest, primarily because the high-resolution inversion better captured local emission hotspots. Sensitivity tests underscored the importance of nested inversions in reducing the influence of boundary condition uncertainties on emission estimates. This study provides robust CH4 emission estimates for China, crucial for understanding the CH4 budget and informing climate mitigation strategies."

Mei;Gregory J. Hakim;Max Taniguchi-King;Dominik Stiller;Alexander J. Turner,Emulating chemistry-climate dynamics with a linear inverse model,"Chemistry-climate models are used to investigate how physical climate influences the composition of the atmosphere but are slow and expensive to run. We train a linear inverse model that can replicate the behavior of chemistry-climate models at low computational cost. It captures how large-scale climate features like El Niño affect atmospheric composition and can make accurate forecasts up to a year ahead. This model enables fast hypothesis testing and estimates of past atmospheric composition. 
 Coupled chemistry–climate models (CCMs) are powerful tools for investigating chemical variability in the climate system, but high computational cost limits their use for hypothesis testing and adequately sampling variability on long timescales. Here, we present the first application of a linear inverse model (LIM) to emulate a CCM. A LIM is a low-dimensional empirical model that reproduces the CCM's statistics and dynamics at low computational cost. By linearizing the CCM's dynamics, the LIM captures coherent modes of variability, such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), that describe the coupled evolution of physical and chemical fields. Deterministic seasonal forecasts of the LIM result in skillful predictions of physical and chemical variables at lead times up to a year, outperforming damped persistence models. We show that the LIM's skill in chemical fields depends on its coupled chemistry–climate modes: forecasts without the ENSO dynamical mode show a substantial loss of skill, suggesting the importance of ENSO in driving predictable chemical variability. These results demonstrate that the LIM can efficiently emulate CCM dynamics. It offers a practical tool for testing hypotheses about the drivers of chemistry-climate interactions and may enable efficient chemical data assimilation in the future."

Among them, the Goda and Elfouhaily spectra are well applied for remote sensing simulations. However, they do not consider the sea state factor well. In this research, based on them, we apply the spectra measured from the Surface Waves Investigation and Monitoring instrument and establish a Combined Spectrum. Validation indicates the established spectrum is closer to the SWIM described sea surface with varied sea states. 
 The one-dimensional ocean wave spectra (1D spectra) describing the total energy of the ocean waves are vital for providing ocean surface roughness information in remote sensing simulations. Most existing wave spectrum models deviate from real ocean surface descriptions due to limitations of observation methods and approximation in theories applied to generating them. In this research, the widely applied Goda and Elfouhaily spectra in their 1D form are compared with the remote sensing products from the Surface Waves Investigation and Monitoring instrument (SWIM) on-board the China France Oceanography Satellite (CFOSAT). Differences between models and the measurements are addressed, and the causes are analysed before concluded in terms of sea states. Then, a Combined spectrum (C spectrum) considering varied sea states is proposed as a closer model to the observations of the real sea, where parameterization of the spectral peak enhancement factor (γ) is achieved by the inverse wave age and wave steepness for multiple sea states. Then the specific values of the all-state sea are obtained from SWIM observations. The validation of the C spectrum is achieved by comparisons with SWIM measurements not utilized during the model establishment, and with buoy measurements. The difference index (DI) and the R-squared (R2), are calculated for evaluation of the results, indicating that the C spectrum demonstrates closer fitting to the SWIM and buoy measurements than both Goda and Elfouhaily spectra. The DI and R2 for the C spectrum are compared to the Goda spectrum, which is closer to SWIM measurements than E spectrum. Results suggest the C spectrum is suitable for providing information required for remote sensing applications."

The sources driving this increase remain unclear. In this study, we developed a source-receptor relationship database combining multiplatform ozone data and advanced atmospheric transport modeling. This database can identify emission regions responsible for ozone increases and can also be used to analyze other co-observed atmospheric constituents. 
 Long-term atmospheric ozone observations in Western North America (WNA) provide essential data for assessing tropospheric ozone trends. Backward atmospheric simulations based on these observations establish the source–receptor relationships (SRRs) to improve our understanding of the factors driving ozone trends across different regions, time periods, and atmospheric layers. In this study, we integrated 28 years of ozone observations (1994–2021) from ozonesondes, lidar, commercial aircraft, and aircraft campaigns across WNA, spanning the upper atmospheric boundary layer, free troposphere, and upper troposphere (i.e., 900 to 300 hPa). We integrated the multiplatform datasets using a data fusion framework to generate 553 608 gridded ozone receptors. For each receptor, we use the FLEXible PARTicle (FLEXPART) dispersion model, driven by ERA5 reanalysis data, to produce the SRRs calculations, providing global simulations at high temporal (hourly) and spatial (1°×1°) resolution from the surface up to 20 km a.g.l. (above ground level). This SRR database retains detailed information for each receptor, including the gridded ozone value product, which enables user to illustrate and identify source contributions to various subsets of ozone observations in the troposphere above WNA over nearly 3 decades at different vertical layers and temporal scales, such as diurnal, daily, seasonal, intra-annual, and decadal. More generally, the calculated SRRs are applicable to any study looking to evaluate origins of airmasses reaching WNA. As such, this database can support source contribution analyses for other atmospheric components observed over WNA, if other co-located observations have been made at the spatial and temporal scales defined for some or all of the gridded ozone receptors used here.

This paper describes the protocols and data available for modeling groups to add this anomalous freshwater to their ocean modules to better represent the impacts of these fluxes on ocean circulation, sea ice, salinity and sea level. 
 Anomalous freshwater fluxes from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets and ice shelves are impacting the surrounding oceans, and we need to be able to account for these effects in climate model simulations over the historical period and in future projections. In previous phases of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), models mostly either assumed that the ice sheets were in mass balance, or that discharge from the ice sheets was constant, but in neither case was the observed increasing discharge over the historical period properly represented. In this paper, we present data products of absolute and anomalous freshwater mass fluxes from both major ice sheets, and recommendations for their use in historical simulations. These fluxes can be implemented in climate simulations as a forcing for models that do not (yet) include interactive ice sheets, or used to evaluate models that do. We also make recommendations for how climatological and anomalous fluxes can be implemented in climate models that may have different approaches to interactions with the ice sheets. These forcings are available for CMIP7 simulations and should lead to more robust and coherent simulation of sea surface temperature, sea ice and regional sea level trends in the recent historical period and, as these data are extended, improve the credibility of projections."

By decomposing model outputs into oscillatory components, we preserve critical information across various timescales, ensuring more reliable projections. This improved reliability supports strategic decisions in sectors such as agriculture, water resources, and disaster preparedness. 
 Bias correction is a crucial step in using Earth system model outputs for assessments, as it adjusts systematic errors by comparing the model to observations. However, standard methods – ranging from mean-based linear scaling to distribution-based quantile mapping  typically treat bias correction as a single-scale process, overlooking the fact that biases can manifest differently across daily, seasonal, and annual timescales. In this study, we propose a novel, timescale-aware bias-correction approach built on Empirical Mode Decomposition. By decomposing the meteorological signal into multiple oscillatory components and aggregating them to represent distinct timescales, we apply targeted corrections to each component, thereby preserving both short- and long-term structure in the data. Experimental illustrations show that the timescale-aware EMDBC framework matches the performance of conventional quantile-delta mapping (QDM) at the native daily scale and achieves progressively larger bias reductions at bi-weekly, seasonal, and annual scales. As a result, the proposed approach offers a more robust path to accurate and reliable Earth system projections, strengthening their utility for resilience and adaptation planning."

This anisotropy increases with depth into the inner core and may result from alignment of iron crystals deformed during inner core growth. Using previously calculated elastic properties of iron, we seek to determine the most likely iron‐light element alloy (FeC, FeO, FeS, or FeSi). For each FeX alloy, we interpolate elastic tensors across the pressure and temperature range of the inner core and model the anisotropy resulting from flow during core growth. Lastly, we compare predicted PKIKP travel times with observations to determine the best fitting alloy.

Using observations and data‐assimilating model output, the impact of seasonal extension of the eastern WG on the local eddy kinetic energy (EKE) field was investigated. By altering the ambient density field, the gyre seasonal extension modulates both EKE production via baroclinic instability (BCC) and EKE redistribution through the pressure work (PW). When WG extends eastward in autumn‐winter, the more enhanced PW drives EKE outward flux outweighing its local production by BCC. In contrast, during spring‐summer as WG contracts, the dominant role of BCC production over PW removal favors EKE accumulation. Understanding these dynamics is critical to predicting eddy‐induced warm inflow into a potentially expanding WG under climate change, and also provides insight into interactions between eddy and mean flow fields in the Southern Ocean."

In the four estuaries, along‐channel fronts dominate the spatial frontal distribution patterns, and their generation is found to be related to a simple parameter that can be quantified with horizontal velocity, depth and bottom slope. Where there are high values of this parameter, estuarine surface fronts are more likely to occur.

Stratus dominates the poleward regime of the cyclones. It transitions into closed mesoscale cellular convection (MCC) downstream and then to open MCC in the cold sector of cyclones. Clustered and suppressed cumulus are often found in the warm sector. Principal component (PC) analysis is applied to a set of cloud controlling factors to characterize properties of the entire extratropical cyclone that are critical to low cloud mesoscale morphologies. The first two PCs are strongly related to cyclone intensity and sea surface temperature averaged over the cyclone domain, respectively. Daily average insolation at the top of the atmosphere, which has large seasonal and latitudinal variability over the SO, is used as an additional independent predictor. Closed and open MCC are negatively correlated with insolation, while disorganized MCC and clustered cumulus are positively correlated with insolation. In stronger cyclones, closed MCC, open MCC, and clustered cumulus tend to be more frequent, whereas stratus and suppressed cumulus tend to be less common. In cyclones over a colder sea surface, closed MCC and stratus are more abundant, and clustered cumulus and suppressed cumulus are less abundant. These results deepen the current understanding of low cloud processes and provide insights of transitions between morphologies, and thus changes in cloud radiative effects, over the SO in a changing climate."

The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is experiencing significant accelerated warming with the Amazon's warming‐drying impact exhibiting interdecadal differences around 2004. During 1981–2004 (P1), Amazonian warming in March, by exciting the North Atlantic Tripole pattern, enhanced the African jet stream and triggered the eastward propagation of Rossby waves leading to an abnormal strengthening of the northern wind over the TP in April. This suppressed snowmelt and expanded snow cover, significantly increasing albedo and thereby inhibiting warming in the central and western TP. From 2005 to 2023 (P2), TP surface skin temperature (SKT) and soil moisture replaced snow albedo as the dominant factor for warming. The Amazon's warm‐dry signal extended northward, triggering warming in the Greenland Sea and exciting anomalous wave trains propagating southeastward. These waves intensified TP warming by regulating atmospheric circulation and surface radiation processes. The study demonstrates that as the Amazon Rainforest approaches a climate critical point, the cross‐continental teleconnection mechanism with the TP undergoes fundamental changes, highlighting the nonlinear impact of climate subsystems' critical states on amplification effects. This finding provides a dynamical basis for understanding the synergistic effects of global climate critical points."

Recent work that mapped the trajectory of the Sun found that the solar system may have passed through a massive interstellar cold cloud–the Local Lynx of Cold Clouds–with density nH≈ ${n}_{H}\approx $ 3,000 cm−3 ${\text{cm}}^{-3}$ two to three million years ago. Such crossing would have compressed the heliosphere and directly exposed Earth to the interstellar flux of GCRs, which will react with N2 ${\mathrm{N}}_{2}$ and O2 ${\mathrm{O}}_{2}$ molecules to produce ion pairs in the atmosphere. Using a 2D atmospheric chemistry and dynamics model, we simulate how the increased low‐energy GCR flux affects Earth's climate. We study two cases: the removal of heliospheric shielding, and the concurrent effect of exposure to interstellar GCRs and a geomagnetic pole reversal, such as the Gauss‐Matuyama pole reversal which occurred 2.58 Mya. Without heliospheric shielding, we find a 5%–15% increase in polar stratospheric NOy ${\text{NO}}_{y}$ when compared to pre‐industrial solar minimum conditions. This produces a 1%–2% decrease in polar stratospheric ozone which decreases stratospheric temperatures by ≈ ${\approx} $0.1–0.2 K. In the case that a geomagnetic pole reversal would occur during the cold cloud crossing, we see almost no shielding of cosmic rays at the equator and mid‐latitudes; this produces over 50% NOy ${\text{NO}}_{y}$ enhancement, 14% polar stratospheric ozone depletion, and up to ≈ ${\approx} $1 K decrease in stratospheric temperature. Changes in stratospheric temperatures could have localized effects on surface temperatures, and ozone depletion could increase UV exposure on Earth's surface."

In this study, the physicochemical properties and formation mechanisms of secondary aerosols in cloud‐free, cloud interstitial, and cloud residual particles are investigated at a mountain site in southeastern China. The results show that elevated concentrations of NO3− and more‐oxidized oxygenated organic aerosol (MO‐OOA) in cloud‐free particles primarily result from aqueous‐phase reactions along the dust transport. Aqueous‐phase processes during cloud events promoted the formation of NO3−, SO42−, NH4+ and MO‐OOA, with cloud residual particles exhibited 1.2–1.6 times higher growth rates than cloud interstitial particles. Lower fractions of C4H7+, C4H9+, C5H6O+, and C3H7O3+ were found in cloud residual particles, suggesting that cloud droplets could facilitate the aging of these organics. Additionally, higher liquid water content increases the O/C ratio in secondary organic aerosols (SOA) by 0.1–0.15, and higher O3 concentrations facilitate oxidation in cloud droplets via hydroxyl radicals (•OH) production in the acidic cloud water.

10.1029/2025JD044044,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,该研究论文探讨了热带气旋中的平流层-对流层交换（STE）现象，以及由此引起的 верхняя тропосфера и нижняя стратосфера (UTLS) 组成的改变。论文使用理想化的模拟来评估水汽浓度和被动示踪剂，以了解STE过程和传输路径。研究结果表明，热带气旋内部核心区域的 нижняя стратосфера 存在大量的水汽增加，并且在热带气旋及其内部核心区域的 над вершинами штормов 存在显著的双向传输。虽然该研究没有直接涉及遥感技术或特定的卫星/传感器，但它对大气成分分析和理解大气过程具有重要意义，这些过程可以通过遥感技术进行监测和研究。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术具有一定的相关性。,"['stratosphere-troposphere exchange', 'tropical cyclone', 'water vapor', 'atmospheric composition', 'UTLS composition change', 'passive tracers']",Andrea E. Gordon;Cameron R. Homeyer,Examining Stratosphere‐Troposphere Exchange in an Idealized Simulation of a Tropical Cyclone,"Tropical cyclones (TCs) have been recognized for their damaging hazards and impacts on the climate system. One under‐investigated climate impact from TCs is stratosphere‐troposphere exchange (STE) and accompanying upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) composition change, which alters the radiation budget. Previous case studies have identified multiple STE processes within TCs, but it remains unclear how much STE occurs in individual storms and how these individual processes contribute to the total STE in TCs. This study utilizes an idealized simulation to provide a more thorough understanding of the importance of STE in TCs and the role of various STE processes. The 3‐D TC version of the Bryan Cloud Model (CM1) is used to simulate a TC and evaluate UTLS composition change and accompanying transport pathways. STE and composition change are assessed using water vapor concentrations and a suite of custom passive tracers. These passive tracers include: boundary layer and stratospheric tracers, and a convective tracer. The simulation suggests substantial hydration of the lower stratosphere occurs within the TC inner core. Specifically, water vapor reaches nearly 20 ppmv at an altitude of approximately 18.5 km (> ${ >} $2 km above the tropopause) with a spatial extent limited to 250 km from TC center. Downward transport of stratospheric air occurs (a) within the upper portion of the near‐tropopause outflow and (b) via subsidence within the eye, where approximately 10% stratospheric air reaches altitudes as low as 7 km. Additionally, substantial two‐way transport is found within overshooting tops in the TC and its inner core."

Although previous studies have used remote sensing data to assess the impact of PV facilities on greenness, there is still a lack of in‐depth exploration into the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation changes within these facilities and their driving factors. This study focuses on the Yellow River Basin, a region severely affected by soil erosion, using PV data sets from 2010 to 2021 and 30‐m resolution Normalized Difference Vegetation Index to conduct a pixel‐level analysis of the environmental impacts of PV facilities. The results reveal that, while 60% of PV‐occupied areas exhibited increased greenness post‐deployment, only 14% of facilities showed overall greening, and 72% exhibited less greening than their respective control areas. These findings indicate that PV deployment does not result in net greening at the landscape scale. Higher background greenness was associated with better vegetation recovery within PV facilities. Human activities also significantly influenced greenness change within PV facility. The intensity of land disturbance during PV construction may hinder vegetation recovery, but human management post PV construction appears to mitigate previous land uses, leading to vegetation improvement within PV installations. These findings underscore the importance of scientifically planning PV facilities in fragile regions, suggesting that appropriate site selection and management can facilitate sustainable renewable energy development and promote ecosystem restoration."

 Phosphorus is a critically limiting nutrient in marine ecosystems, with alkaline phosphatases (APases) playing a vital role in liberating phosphate from organic compounds. However, the dominant taxa and APase families driving the marine phosphorus cycle, particularly in the deep ocean, remain poorly understood. Equally enigmatic remains the (multi)functional diversity and mechanisms of action of different APases. To address these gaps, this study combines global multi-omic analyses, biochemical studies of purified recombinant proteins, and laboratory experiments with proteomics and enzymatic rate measurements. Here we show that multi-omics consistently identify Alteromonas as a primary contributor to APase expression and production, with PhoA as the dominant APase family, particularly in the deep ocean. Furthermore, all four major APase families (PhoA, PhoD, PhoX, PafA) exhibit multifunctionality, revealing distinct substrate preferences and regulatory mechanisms. Ultimately, this study expands the mechanistic understanding of the marine phosphorus cycle, while revealing the significance of enzyme multifunctionality in elemental cycles.

 The ocean, because of its ability to store heat and as the biggest mediator of water exchanges on Earth, modulates the climate from years to centuries. By combining Water Mass transformation and the Temporal-Residual-Mean frameworks, together with a direct estimation of turbulent diffusivity (computed through an artificial intelligence method), we determine temperature and salinity transformations along density surfaces. Because isopycnal transformations barely alter the density field, they remain hidden from the ocean dynamics. Here we unveil these hidden, isopycnal transformations from in situ observations at 1000-m depth. We shows that these isopycnal transformations are 5 times as large as their diapycnal counterpart and are occurring for  ~ 67% in the Southern Ocean. Our estimations stress the role of the spatially-varying and anisotropic characteristics of isopycnal diffusion, often not considered in ocean models. This has major consequences for our understanding of the role of the ocean in response to anthropogenic climate changes.

 Avena fatua (weedy oat) is a globally pervasive weed, notorious for its adaptability to extreme environments and herbicide tolerance. Here, we present the 10.98-Gb hexaploid genome of A. fatua and a variation map from 768 wild and cultivated oats (A. fatua, A. sterilis and A. sativa), elucidating their genetic relationship and evolutionary history. Population genomic analyses reveal genetic connections between A. fatua and cultivated naked oats, and identify divergent regions between A. fatua and A. sativa enriched in genes associated with biotic and abiotic stresses. Among them, a herbicide-resistance locus is identified on chromosome 4D, with A. fatua accessions carrying a highly differentiated haplotype from cultivated oats. Multi-omics profiling and functional validation demonstrate that one expanded GST gene in this locus contributes significantly to oat herbicide resistance.

 Extreme heat events are observed increasingly in eastern China during recent high-summer (July–August), yet their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we reveal considerable changes in local interannual temperature variability, manifesting as the enhancing south-north uniform warming (SNUW) mode and the disappearing south-north meridional dipole (SNMD) mode. The strengthening interannual SNUW variability is mainly associated with the increasing interannual variability of Pakistan convective precipitation and Arctic Oscillation, with the former linked to anthropogenic warming and the latter reflecting natural fluctuations. The decline in the interannual SNMD variability can be linked to the reduced interannual sea-ice variability in the Barents-Kara seas after 2004, which is associated with the disappearance of the Rossby wavetrain propagating towards eastern China. Moreover, projections from climate models suggest that future SNUW amplification will be dominated by increasing Pakistan convective precipitation variability; whereas the Arctic Oscillation influence is likely to be limited, featuring internal cyclical fluctuations of relatively small amplitude. Although models reproduce the SNUW mode reasonably well, their performance in simulating SNMD remains unsatisfactory, leaving the attribution of SNMD variability highly uncertain. Nevertheless, model projections consistently point to a further disappearance of the SNMD mode in the future. Together, these results highlight a fundamental reorganization of interannual temperature variability in eastern China under climate warming, and provide a new perspective for understanding the recent rapid changes in regional temperature variability."

 Montane forests are biodiversity hotspots that provide important ecosystem services, including temperature buffering for numerous species underneath forest canopies. In recent decades, montane forests have been under increasing pressure from small-and large-scale deforestation, yet associated spatio-temporal changes in temperature buffering capacity remain unclear. Here, we studied the changes in temperature buffering capacity due to forest loss from 2003 to 2022 in three montane forest ecosystems in Africa (Mount Kilimanjaro, Mount Bale, and the Taita Hills). We modeled the temperature buffering changes based on in situ microclimate measurements inside forests and in open areas, climate data, airborne laser scanning data, and satellite observations. We found that during the study period montane forests were lost at a rate of 2–9% across the study areas. This loss led to an annual average microclimate air temperature warming ranging from 2.0 ± 0.8 °C to 5.6 ± 2.1 °C across the three montane forests. The warming reduced the maximum air temperature buffering by an average of 3 ± 1.5 °C. Locally, the temperature buffering disappeared over time and transitioned to a mesoclimate amplification. Our findings demonstrate that microclimate buffering capacity was markedly diminished as a result of microclimate warming driven by recent forest loss. Between 2003 and 2022, montane forests in Africa saw a 2–9% decrease, resulting in higher microclimate air temperatures and a reduction in microclimate buffering capacity, according to analysis of changes in temperature buffering capacity due to forest loss."

 Porphyry copper (-gold) deposits in both arc and non-arc settings are hosted by oxidized magmatic rocks, but the exact mechanism by which the source magmas of these non-arc deposits become oxidized remains obscure. Through whole-rock geochemistry, mineral chemistry, and zircon isotopic analyses, here we show that the Neoproterozoic root of the Cretaceous Shaxi porphyry copper-gold deposit in the Jiangnan orogen is reduced and copper-sulfide rich, whereas the Cretaceous ore-forming magmas are oxidized. An oxidized mafic melt flushed the Neoproterozoic root zone, extracted copper and gold, and transported them to the upper crust where the Cretaceous Shaxi deposit formed. Evidence is recorded in growth zones of clinopyroxene, zircon, spinel, and plagioclase. Our results indicate that the relatively reduced, sulfide-enriched sub-continental lithospheric mantle or lower crust is essential but not sufficient for the formation of fertile non-arc porphyry magmas. Addition of a newer oxidized magma is crucial for the formation of this mineralization style.

 High-quality and temporally continuous surface reflectance data are essential for remote sensing applications, but cloud contamination introduces severe spatiotemporal gaps in optical satellite image time series (SITS). Recent multi-modal approaches, integrating optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data with deep learning models, have advanced gap-free SITS reconstruction. However, several challenges remain. These include the reliance on external preprocessing to generate regular optical composite time series (e.g., 8-day intervals) and to temporally align SAR with optical data; insufficient modeling of the relationship between observation time series and their corresponding timestamps limits output flexibility, especially when generating predictions at any or user-specified time points; and reduced training and inference efficiency due to the incorporation of an additional modality (SAR). Collectively, these limitations hinder the practical applicability of current methods. To address the above challenges, this study proposes AnytimeFormer, a Transformer-based model for optical SITS reconstruction. First, AnytimeFormer accepts Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 observations along with their corresponding timestamps as input, and adaptively aligns temporally asynchronous multi-modal time series through a time-align attention module. Second, a low-rank fusion module is introduced to capture multi-modal information while preserving a lightweight architecture. Finally, a time-aware decoder enables the reconstruction of reflectance data at any user-specific time point. Extensive experiments conducted across eight globally distributed study sites, encompassing diverse land cover types and a range of cloud conditions, demonstrate the superior performance of AnytimeFormer (e.g., average RMSE: 0.03, R2: 0.95 at 80 % missing ratio) over benchmarks (HANTS, U-TILISE, STORI, RESTORE-DiT, et al.) under scenarios with different missing ratios and temporal pattern complexity. In terms of efficiency, compared to the suboptimal STORI, it reduces training time tenfold. Furthermore, the comparison with the Planet Fusion product shows a high consistency in temporal trends between the two and demonstrates AnytimeFormer's flexibility in reconstructing user-specified intervals. All the experiment results demonstrate that AnytimeFormer is a promising and practical solution for gap-free optical SITS reconstruction.

 Chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) is tightly linked to photosynthetic electron transport and informs gross primary productivity (GPP) across scales. Sun-induced ChlF (SIF) is typically retrieved at specific wavelengths (e.g., Fraunhofer lines, oxygen absorption bands) within a narrow field of view (solid angle), and given in power units. This spectral SIF radiance, denoted SIFλ, is not directly photosynthetically relevant, rather, it is the integrated radiant exitance, SIFint, expressed in molar units and integrated over 660–800 nm and the full angular domain, that corresponds mechanistically to photosynthesis. It is generally assumed that the SIFλ is proportional to SIFint and that this proportionality is spatially and temporally invariant. Here we tested this assumption with spectrally resolved SIF measured in three crop and six tree species at the leaf level. We found that while SIFλ is significantly related to SIFint at individual Fraunhofer lines, this relationship varies with wavelength and leaf chlorophyll content (LCC). We therefore developed a model to predict SIFint from SIFλ using wavelength and LCC as inputs. The model performed well across the ChlF emission band, particularly in the far-red region, enabling accurate conversion from observed SIFλ to mechanistically relevant SIFint. As an exploratory extension, the model was applied at the canopy scale for C3 and C4 crops with the Mechanistic Light Response model, yielding encouraging agreement between modeled and observed GPP. The core contribution of this work is establishing the SIFλ–SIFint relationship and a transfer model at the leaf scale, while the canopy application serves as an exploratory extension illustrating its scaling potential. Together, these findings provide a more mechanistically consistent basis for SIF-based GPP estimation and strengthen the application of fluorescence observations in carbon cycle research."

 Habitat suitability, which reflects how well environmental conditions support species survival, growth, and reproduction, is highly sensitive to climate change and human activities and underpins effective conservation policy-making. Traditional machine learning models for habitat suitability assessment often struggle to capture complex semantic relationships among environmental factors and suffer from limited spatial generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose GeoKG-HSA, a novel framework leveraging geospatial knowledge graphs to enhance habitat suitability assessment. By adopting an ontology-based approach, GeoKG-HSA explicitly models semantic relationships among diverse environmental variables, enabling structured integration of multi-source heterogeneous habitat data. The framework further integrates symbolic domain knowledge with data-driven machine learning, establishing a hybrid paradigm that improves both interpretability and predictive accuracy. A case study on Tundra Swan habitat in a wetland ecosystem shows that, on average across four models, GeoKG-HSA improves precision by 0.147, recall by 0.281, and F1 score by 0.255. Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores were also improved by 0.04 for the logistic regression model, 0.20 for the support vector machine model, 0.06 for the decision tree model, and 0.13 for the multi-layer perceptron model. Compared with the MaxEnt, GeoKG-HSA exhibits superior spatial generalization in regions with missing or sparse samples. These results demonstrate that GeoKG-HSA effectively integrates multi-source environmental data, enhances model generalizability, and significantly outperforms traditional Tabular-HSA methods. This framework offers a promising tool for advancing biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management under changing environmental conditions."

 Correct classification of crop layers is crucial for crop growth tracking and estimating yields, but existing methods depends heavily on the completeness of data and ground truth labels. Self-supervised learning (SSL) enables crop mapping when data is limited. However, current SSL approaches fail to fully integrate information across spatiotemporal dimensions and lack the ability to learn and represent consistent ground object features. To this end, a self-supervised crop mapping framework is proposed, which integrates adaptive k-means clustering, graph convolution, and global spatiotemporal attention (SAKG). This framework reduces reliance on labeled data through contrastive learning and achieves implicit semantic grouping of crop spatiotemporal features using adaptive K-means clustering, graph convolution, and self-attention mechanisms, enhancing model robustness and representation of complex data while mitigating sample imbalance issues. Three experiments (cross spatial, cross temporal, cross Spatiotemporal) demonstrate that SAKG outperforms existing models in most transfer scenarios. Furthermore, t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding(t-SNE) visualization verifies its effective reduction of spectral differences between the source and target domains, achieving consistent representation of crop features. Overall, this method can effectively utilize existing satellite data and labels to achieve large-scale crop mapping. The code can be obtained here: https://github.com/LijianXie/SAKG-net."

 Accurate land surface feature recognition is vital for geospatial analysis and Earth observation. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) excels in generalization, offering significant potential for remote sensing (RS) monitoring with limited annotated data. This study proposes MM-SAM, a SAM-based framework enhanced with multimodal and multiscale adaptations for fine-grained segmentation of heterogeneous surfaces in open-pit mining areas. Leveraging an adaptive fine-tuning strategy with minimal learnable parameters, MM-SAM tackles domain-specific challenges in mining environments via two key architectural innovations: 1) Multimodal RS Fusion (MRF), a preprocessing adapter integrates multispectral and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, extending SAM’s input from RGB to multidimensional spectral-spatial representations, effectively mitigating spectral distortions caused by terrain variations and cloud occlusions. 2) Multiscale Feature Enhancement (MFE), a lightweight multiscale convolutional adapter is embedded in the image encoder, coupled with a refinement branch in the decoder. This enables the integration of global semantic coherence with multiscale localized details, addressing significant scale variations in mining features. Experimental results demonstrate that MM-SAM achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 69.99%, outperforming SAM by 17.88% and surpassing state-of-the-art methods. It also improves overall accuracy and macro F1 scores while showing robust temporal transferability, maintaining a consistent mIoU of 69.51% across datasets from different years. These confirm MM-SAM’s reliable performance and adaptability to open-pit mining landscapes, potentially advancing foundation models in complex geospatial tasks."

 This study is part of a project which aims to compute the total deposition of sulfur, nitrogen and ozone over both Canada and the US. This initiative is named ADAGIO (Atmospheric Deposition Analysis Generated by Interpolation of model and Observations) and is led by Environment and Climate Change Canada. More details about the overall methodology were given in Part I of this project. Similarly, here, a deterministic data fusion methodology is used to combine information from air quality models and surface observations to produce seasonal objective analyses (OAs) for six gas species (O3,SO2, NO2, NO, HNO3, NH3) and three dry particulate species (p-NH4+, p-NO3-, p-SO4=) for multiple years during the period 2010–2019. The main difference in the methodology with PART II is that for dry species, the OAs are obtained for concentration instead of wet deposition measurements. The seasonal dry deposition fluxes and concentrations obtained from air quality model simulations for each species are corrected using the OA concentration fields to obtain the corrected total annual dry deposition. In part II, we focus on the species which contribute the most to the N deposition, that is NO2, HNO3, and NH3. ADAGIO yields total dry nitrogen deposition results that are in good agreement with those of the US/TDep project of the US. Comparison with satellite-derived concentrations for NH3 and NO2 are also presented and found reasonable. This paper demonstrated that the simple algorithm based on data fusion presented in part I (for wet species) also works for dry species deposition over large territories."

 To understand the physicochemical properties, size distribution, and pollution sources of aerosols in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP), an intensive field observation campaign was conducted in the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture during the summer of 2023. Field observations integrated optical particle counting and ion chromatography, supported by principal component analysis (PCA) and trajectory clustering. Water-soluble inorganic ions (WSII) were dominated by NH4+, followed by NO3−, SO42−, and Cl−. Secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA) showed a strong positive correlation with each other, but a weaker correlation with Cl−. SIA and Cl− ions originated from different emission sources. The mass concentration size distribution exhibited a bimodal pattern dominated by an accumulation mode peak at 0.25 μm and a coarse mode peak at 5 μm with the coarse mode accounting for 89 % of the total mass concentration. Coarse particles constituted the dominant fraction of aerosols, as evidenced by the PM2.5/PM10 ratio of 0.2. SIA was positively correlated with accumulation mode particles (R2 = 0.21), whereas there was no linear relationship with coarse mode aerosols (R2 = 0.01). PCA revealed that regional anthropogenic pollution is the dominant source. Three industrial cities in low-altitude regions were identified as potential source areas of SIA and accumulation mode aerosol, while chloride ions were derived from salt lakes on the plateau.

 Ambient relative humidity (RH) determines the aerosol water content and modulates aerosol optical properties, chemical composition, and mixing state. Understanding aerosol hygroscopicity is crucial for assessing its climate forcing. In this study, aerosol hygroscopic properties were characterized using the measurements of aerosol scattering coefficients (σsp) at varying RH conditions over a tropical coastal environment in the Indian region. The observations were carried out using an aerosol conditioning system consisting of dry (RH <40 %) and wet nephelometers (60–85 %) from 24 December 2019 to 4 January 2020 (winter) and from 3 November 2020 to 30 November 2020 (post-monsoon). The aerosol light-scattering enhancement factor, f(RH) (the ratio of σsp measured by wet and dry nephelometers), was calculated and parameterized using an aerosol growth function. The overall mean dry aerosol total scattering coefficient at 550 nm was 170 ± 72 Mm−1 and 155 ± 61 Mm−1, whereas aerosol light-scattering enhancement factors at 85 % RH, i.e., f(RH = 85 %, 550 nm), were in the range of 1.45–1.48. A higher scattering enhancement (5–8 %) was observed during the sea-breeze periods than the land-breeze periods. Composite aerosol hygroscopicity (κchem) values derived from the concurrent non-refractory submicron aerosol (NR-PM1) chemical composition also reflected contrasting aerosol systems within a day. Aerosol growth function parameter (γ) depicted a well-defined association with the mass fraction of inorganic aerosols, suggesting their prominent role in regulating aerosol scattering properties. Detailed analysis performed to elucidate the role of elevated RH levels (RH > 85 %) revealed that the aerosol liquid water content (ALWC) showed a step enhancement with corresponding mass growth factors (the ratio of mass loading in dry and wet conditions) increasing to as high as 10 to 12. At elevated RH conditions, the ALWC associated with organic aerosol (OA) (ALWCorganics), which is the dominant species in the NR-PM1 aerosol system, also increased significantly. Such enhanced ALWC and hygroscopicity (κorganics) of organics possibly contributed to the increased aqueous-phase production of inorganic aerosols (especially sulfate), as inferred from a significant correlation (r > 0.8) between the parameters. These results highlighted the role played by ambient RH in controlling aerosol formation pathways and their hygroscopic properties over the highly humid tropical atmosphere."

 Clouds play a critical role in climate change and the energy budget in the Arctic. The parameterization of cloud microphysics is crucial for simulating surface radiation and atmospheric vertical structure in the Arctic region. This study evaluates the performance of eight widely used cloud microphysics schemes in the Svalbard region during winter and summer, utilizing field observation data and the polar-optimized Weather Research and Forecasting model (Polar-WRF). The results demonstrated that the choice of cloud microphysics scheme significantly influences surface radiation and simulations of the lower atmosphere. During winter, the Thompson, Morrison, and NSSL schemes effectively simulate surface radiation, whereas the Lin, Goddard, and WSM6 schemes excel in capturing the vertical structure of the atmosphere. In summer, the WSM6 and Thompson schemes show superior performance in simulating surface radiation, whereas the Thompson, Morrison, and CAM5.1 schemes better represent atmospheric profiles. The accuracy of cloud simulations is crucial for surface radiation, as all schemes tend to underestimate downward longwave radiation, primarily due to an overestimation of low cloud cover. In addition, challenges in simulating mixed-phase clouds, which are prevalent in the Svalbard region, were identified, with most schemes overestimating the ice water content and underestimating the liquid water content in winter. In summer, models tend to underestimate the cloud height and liquid water content of low-level clouds. These findings highlight the importance of accurately simulating low-level mixed-phase clouds to improve the understanding of surface–atmosphere interactions in the Arctic."

 Compound dry-hot events (CDHEs), characterized by the concurrence of drought and heat extremes, have become increasingly frequent and severe under climate change, posing significant risks to ecosystems, agriculture, and human society. Understanding the dominant drivers and their interactions across different temporal scales is critical for advancing prediction and attribution of such events. In this study, we develop regression models of the Standardized Compound Drought and Heat Index (SCDHI) at weekly, bi-weekly, and four-week scales for the middle-lower Yangtze River Basin. The models incorporate land-surface and near-surface factors—temperature, soil moisture, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and precipitation-together with large-scale atmospheric circulation indices, including the 500-hPa geopotential height (Z500) and the strength (WS) and area (WA) of the western Pacific subtropical high. By applying explainable machine learning approaches-Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), we systematically quantify the direct contributions of individual variables and their pairwise interactions. Results show that VPD is the most influential driver of CDHEs across all time scales. Circulation factors (Z500, WA, WS) and precipitation become increasingly important at longer scales, underscoring the influence of mid-tropospheric circulation patterns and the western Pacific subtropical high in sustaining extreme events. Notably, interactions across scales-from large-scale circulation anomalies (e.g., Z500) to near-surface atmospheric demand (e.g., VPD) - intensify with both event severity and time scale, underscoring the compound nature of CDHE formation. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive multi-scale attribution framework for CDHEs, demonstrating the added value of combining deep learning regression models with explainable artificial intelligence techniques.
