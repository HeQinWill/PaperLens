10.1021/acs.est.4c05059,False,Environmental Science & Technology,这篇研究论文主要关注的是饮用水中全氟烷基物质（PFAS）在氯消毒过程中的转化途径。研究人员调查了氯化过程中N-(3-(二甲氨基丙-1-基)全氟-1-己烷磺酰胺 (N-AP-FHxSA) 等多种物质的转化情况，发现其会快速转化为多种多氟和全氟产物，例如全氟己酸 (PFHxA)。他们研究了16个氯与N-AP-FHxSA及其季铵类似物的反应，并通过分子轨道计算和pH影响实验探讨了反应机理。总的来说，该研究属于水处理和环境化学领域，与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等，并没有直接关系。,[],Runze Sun;Akash P. Bhat;William A. Arnold;Feng Xiao,Investigation of Transformation Pathways of Polyfluoroalkyl Substances during Chlorine Disinfection,"Recent regulations on perfluorinated compounds in drinking water underscore the need for a deeper understanding of the formation of perfluorinated compounds from polyfluoroalkyl substances during chlorine disinfection. Among the compounds investigated in this study, N-(3-(dimethylaminopropan-1-yl)perfluoro-1-hexanesulfonamide (N-AP-FHxSA) underwent rapid transformation during chlorination. Within an hour, it produced quantitative yields of various poly- and per-fluorinated products, including perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA). Sixteen reactions involving chlorine with N-AP-FHxSA and its quaternary ammonium analog were investigated; seven were confirmed, while the remainder were either disproved or found to be insignificant. The quaternary ammonium moiety did not determine a polyfluoroalkyl substance’s reactivity toward chlorine. For example, while 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonamide betaine transformed rapidly to PFHxA, other quaternary-ammonium-containing polyfluoroalkyl substances, such as 5:1:2 and 5:3 fluorotelomer betaines, showed significant resistance to chlorination. Further investigation identified potential sites for electrophilic attacks near the amine region by examining the highest occupied molecular orbitals of the polyfluoroalkyl substances. Visualization techniques helped pinpoint electron-deficient and electron-rich sites as potential targets for nucleophilic and electrophilic attacks, respectively. Increasing the solution pH from 6 to 10 did not diminish the apparent degradation of the studied polyfluoroalkyl substances, likely due to the greater reactivity of the deprotonated forms compared to the conjugate acids. Finally, we also examined the hydrolysis of polyfluoroalkyl substances at pH 6 to 11 in the absence of chlorine."

Previous studies have reported that PFOA upregulates lipid metabolism and is associated with liver injury in humans. However, when the fatty acid degradation pathway is activated, lipid accumulation still occurs, suggesting the presence of unknown pathways and mechanisms that remain to be elucidated. In this study, adult C57BL/6N mice were exposed to PFOA at 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/kg/day. Using integrated metabolomics and transcriptomics, it was uncovered that arginine metabolism was differentially downregulated in all three groups. In vitro studies confirmed the downregulation of arginine metabolism in MIHA cell lines treated with PFOA. Supplementation of arginine could effectively rescue liver injury and downregulate the chemokine levels caused by PFOA. This finding highlights the contribution of arginine metabolism in maintaining liver health following PFOA exposure and suggests potential mechanisms of metabolic and immune modulation."

Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) depend on critical materials (CMs) for their batteries and electronic components, yet their widespread adoption may face constraints due to the limited availability of CMs. This study assesses the implications of vehicle electrification and lightweighting (material substitution) on the U.S. CM demand for light-duty vehicles (LDVs) and medium- and heavy-duty vehicles (MHDVs). Market sales scenarios of 100% internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), 100% BEVs, and a 50%/50% mix are considered. The findings reveal that LDVs dominate the total CM demand despite MHDVs requiring more CMs per vehicle. Cobalt, graphite, lithium, neodymium, and nickel are critical for the 100% BEV adoption scenario, whereas palladium and rhodium are critical for ICEVs. LDV lightweighting increases total CM quantity per vehicle due to steel replacement with aluminum but reduces the vehicle’s mass, operational energy consumption, and reliance on high-concern battery-related CMs. Transitioning from nickel manganese cobalt (NMC622) to lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery chemistry reduces CM use but increases demand for strategic materials such as copper and phosphorus. This study uniquely evaluates U.S. CM demand for LDVs and MHDVs across conventional and electric powertrains and investigates light-weighting and battery chemistry impacts."

Using a chemical similarity-based approach, it is difficult to identify minor structural differences that contribute to the significant changes of toxicity. Here, we used omics and computational toxicology to identify chemical features associated with BP analogue-induced embryonic toxicity, offering valuable insights to inform the design of safer chemical alternatives. The zebrafish embryonic acute toxicity, behavioral effects, and concentration-dependent transcriptome analysis of 17 BP analogues were tested, and the chemical structure characteristics and key biological activities-induced embryonic toxicity were explored. BPE, BPF, BPP, BPBP, and BPS induced lower embryonic lethality than BPA. And, 8 BP analogues triggered hyperactive behavior at environmentally and human relevant concentrations. BP analogues with phenol rings linked via hydrophobic segments (“chain:alkaneBranch_neopentyl_C5”) disturbed stress response, leading to embryonic lethality, and introducing hydrophobic groups on the meta position of bisphenol structure augmented their embryonic lethality effects. “3DACorr_TotChg_3” of BP analogues is a key physicochemical feature for behavioral disorders, and BP analogues with 3DACorr_TotChg_3 value < 0.11 could induce hyperactive behavior by perturbing neurodevelopment relevant biological pathways.

Today, little is known about the mechanisms of foliar Hg accumulation and how climate factors and tree physiology interact to impact it. Here, we examined meteorological factors, foliar physiological traits, and Hg accumulation rates from leaf emergence to senescence in a tropical rainforest, tropical savanna, and subtropical evergreen broadleaf forest. Also, robust models for foliar Hg accumulation were parametrized. Generally, foliar Hg accumulation rate in subtropical evergreen forest was highest (16.4 ± 12.3 ng m–2 day–1), followed by the tropical rainforest (14.2 ± 9.8 ng m–2 day–1), and lowest in the tropical savanna (4.7 ± 4.9 ng m–2 day–1). Atmospheric relative humidity, stomatal conductance, and leaf photosynthesis are key drivers of spatial-temporal variations in foliar Hg accumulation. The canopy-structure-induced specific leaf physiological traits drive temporal variations in foliar Hg accumulation, and climate-controlled leaf physiological traits account for spatial variations among three forests. Finally, our robust models enable precise simulation of foliar Hg accumulation rates at both tree species and ecosystem scales facilitating particularly regional and global Hg transport and chemical models to quantify the vegetation’s role as a sink for atmospheric Hg0 uptake."

This study uncovered a novel environmental phenomenon induced by aged PS-M/NPs and delved into the underlying mechanisms. Our findings revealed that the aged PS-M/NP particles significantly amplified the photodegradation of common cephalosporin antibiotics, and the extent of enhancement was tightly correlated to the molecular structures of cephalosporin antibiotics. Notably, the results confirmed that the hydroxyl radical (OH•) acted as the primary agent to drive the accelerated degradation. Furthermore, in-depth analysis utilizing in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, batch adsorption experiments, and theoretical calculations underscored that the structure-dependent enhancement stemmed from the specific hydrogen bonding sites, rather than mere adsorption capacity. Specifically, the −OOH group (hydroperoxyl group) on the PS surface exhibited a greater potential to generate OH• compared to the −OH group. Therefore, cephalosporins that formed hydrogen bonds with −OOH moieties on the aged PS surfaces, as opposed to −OH, would experience a more pronounced degradation enhancement. Thus, the unique interaction pattern between contaminants and PS-M/NPs transforms aged PS into a selective reactor, facilitating the targeted degradation of pharmaceuticals in aquatic ecosystems."

However, the combined effects of these factors are not well understood. Using North Carolina as a case study, we (i) estimate the demographic characteristics of the private well population; (ii) evaluate representation in well testing records; and (iii) demonstrate how spatial scale influences knowledge of well-using household demographics and representation in testing. We leverage a statewide database of 117,960 well testing records collected over 20 years and a national model predicting well locations. An estimated 25% well-using households identify as Black, Indigenous, and Persons of Color (BIPOC) and 15% have incomes below the poverty threshold. While there is robust well sampling (an average of 4,269 wells tested annually), we observed that most testing records were from predominately White block groups (BGs). Well-using households that did not participate in state testing were 2.4 times more likely to be from predominately BIPOC BGs compared predominately White BGs. Due to the spatial heterogeneity of the well population, demographic differences in well populations were more evident using higher resolution data. Multifaceted testing approaches that couple government-driven efforts with localized studies that engage underrepresented communities are needed to facilitate evidence-based management."

With the 2024 change of the annual PM2.5 standard and the prevalence of multiday wintertime inversion episodes in the western U.S., understanding the wintertime performance of chemical transport models is important. This study explores the impact of chemical mechanism choice on the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model performance for PM2.5 and implications for attainment demonstration in inversion-prone areas in the western United States. Total and speciated PM2.5 observations were used to evaluate wintertime CMAQ simulations using four chemical mechanisms. The study evaluated intermechanism differences in total and secondary PM2.5 and the impact of meteorology at sites with observed multiday temperature inversions. Model performance for total PM2.5 was similar across chemical mechanisms, but intermechanism differences for total and secondary PM2.5 were exacerbated during inversion periods, suggesting that modeled chemistry contributes to the model bias. Results suggest that nitrate, ammonium, and organic carbon are secondary species for which model results do not agree or perform to standard evaluation metrics in scientific literature. These findings show a need for mechanistic investigations of the causes of these differences."

To date, wildfire smoke research, risk communication, and public health action has focused on short-term (or daily) smoke exposures. However, the patterns of wildfire smoke exposure are transitioning to include longer duration and repeated exposures occurring within and across years. Epidemiologic and experimental studies represent important lines of evidence that have informed risk communication and public health actions for short-term smoke exposures; however, they have yet to provide the science needed to refine public health approaches to include other dynamic exposure durations such as repeated, episodic, or cumulative. This commentary provides an overview of methodological approaches used and recent findings from epidemiologic and experimental studies that examined longer duration, repeated smoke exposures. Based on the current science, we recommend that future epidemiologic and experimental studies of wildfire smoke examine multiple exposure metrics to capture the duration, frequency, and intensity of exposures. Such studies would improve the science produced to best support the needs of the public as we strive to further protect public health in a world projected to have more smoke."

Here, we employed different estrogen exposure scenarios to compare the applicability of mucus VTG and other conventional biomarkers in zebrafish for EE monitoring. After acute exposure to 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2) at various concentrations, mucus VTG demonstrated higher sensitivity in male zebrafish than in female zebrafish. Mucus VTG change patterns were similar to liver and blood VTG change patterns in males. Time-course exposure experiments revealed that male mucus VTG responded to EE2 much earlier than male liver and blood VTG, underlining the promise of mucus VTG as an early warning signal of aquatic estrogenicity. Exposure to multiple EEs further validated the high sensitivity of male mucus VTG. Proteomics analysis revealed that EE2 exposure potently shifted the proteome structure of male mucosa, and the VTG1 isoform was noted to be the most suitable biomarker.

Brown,Do CMIP6 Models Capture Seasonal and Regional Differences in the Asymmetry of ENSO‐Precipitation Teleconnections?,"El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a prominent climate phenomenon affecting precipitation patterns across much of the world. Regional ENSO‐precipitation teleconnections are often asymmetric such that the precipitation response to El Niño is stronger or weaker than the response to La Niña. Better understanding of asymmetry in teleconnections can improve the predictability of climate extremes during ENSO events. In this study, we assess the capability of 50 state‐of‐the‐art climate models and a reanalysis against observational data in simulating seasonal differences in asymmetric response of precipitation to ENSO. The analysis is performed across 46 sub‐continental scale regions, using a precipitation composite technique for deriving the asymmetric component of precipitation response. Significant regional and seasonal diversity is found in the asymmetric response to ENSO, both in observations and models. Model performance in simulating the nature of teleconnections is higher than the performance in simulating the associated asymmetry. Model performance in capturing the regional diversity of asymmetry is highest in austral spring. The model biases in asymmetry are related to the inability of the models to accurately simulate the skewness of the heavy tailed local precipitation distributions and Niño3.4 SST distributions. In regions outside the Pacific and Indian Ocean basins, model bias in the skewness of local precipitation variability plays a larger role in model asymmetry bias. This analysis contributes to better understanding the fidelity of CMIP6 models in capturing asymmetry in teleconnections across different seasons and regions which are critical for making skillful projections of floods and droughts in a warming climate."

The statistical results indicate that ERA5 underestimates the warm‐core intensity of TCs. It shows a moist bias at the tropopause and a cold‐moist bias in the boundary layer beyond four times the radius of maximum winds (RMW). In contrast, within 4 RMW, a warm‐dry bias in the boundary layer was observed. The temperature bias is more pronounced at the TC center, and relative humidity exhibits a similar pattern, primarily in the mid and upper troposphere. The bias distribution is asymmetric, most prominent in the right front quadrant of the TC's motion direction. Besides, bias correction is performed using an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model and the biases can be reduced by approximately 60%. The dependence relationships between relative humidity and the influencing factors are investigated through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values. The results indicate that low‐level relative humidity increases and instability intensifies in TCs at night. Additionally, the findings suggest that ERA5 may inadequately capture the diurnal variation of relative humidity in TCs.

Under this seeding scheme, cloud seeding is mainly deployed over lower latitudes which leads to a La Niña‐like pattern of response which is a major unintended consequence. Potential mechanisms behind such side effects are presented and discussed.

To reduce uncertainties in future projected precipitation and temperature, multimodel projections comprising 25 general circulation models (GCMs) were sourced from the recent Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase six (CMIP6) and used to create a Multi‐Model Ensemble. The changes in historical climate zones on CMIP6 simulations were divided into six periods considering data availability (1954–1964; 1964–1974; 1974–1984; 1984–1994; 1994–2004; and 2004–2014). Furthermore, the climate zone reproducibility of 25 CMIP6 GCMs was compared with the reference data sourced from Global Precipitation Climatology Centre precipitation and Climatic Research Unit temperature. The future climate zones were projected into seven periods using monthly precipitation and surface temperature under four main SSP scenarios. Consequently, the climate variables from GCMs were overestimated compared to the reference data, and the composition of the climate zones was less complex. While temperature discrepancies of 1–2°C may not drastically alter the Köppen‐Geiger climate zone classifications, precipitation‐based classifications are significantly impacted by the observed errors. Thus, it is crucial to recognize that despite the advancements in GCMs, they still possess limitations in accurately predicting “real” future climate changes.

 The difluoromethyl group is a crucial fluorinated moiety with distinctive biological properties, and the synthesis of chiral CF₂H-containing analogs has been recognized as a powerful strategy in drug design. To date, the most established method for accessing enantioenriched difluoromethyl compounds involves the enantioselective functionalization of nucleophilic and electrophilic CF₂H synthons. However, this approach is limited by lower reactivity and reduced enantioselectivity. Leveraging the unique fluorine effect, we design and synthesize a radical CF₂H synthon by incorporating isoindolinone into alkyl halides for asymmetric radical transformation. Here, we report an efficient strategy for the asymmetric construction of carbon stereocenters featuring a difluoromethyl group via nickel-catalyzed Negishi cross-coupling. This approach demonstrates mild reaction conditions and excellent enantioselectivity. Given that optically pure difluoromethylated amines and isoindolinones are key structural motifs in bioactive compounds, this strategy offers a practical solution for the efficient synthesis of CF₂H-containing chiral drug-like molecules.

 The lack of effective therapies for visual restoration in Retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration has led to the development of new strategies, such as optogenetics and retinal prostheses. However, visual restoration is poor due to the massive light-evoked activation of retinal neurons, regardless of the segregation of visual information in ON and OFF channels, which is essential for contrast sensitivity and spatial resolution. Here, we show that Ziapin2, a membrane photoswitch that modulates neuronal capacitance and excitability in a light-dependent manner, is capable of reinstating, in mouse and rat genetic models of photoreceptor degeneration, brisk and sluggish ON, OFF, and ON-OFF responses in retinal ganglion cells evoked by full-field stimuli, with reactivation of their excitatory and inhibitory conductances. Intravitreally injected Ziapin2 in fully blind rd10 mice restores light-driven behavior and optomotor reflexes. The results indicate that Ziapin2 is a promising molecule for reinstating physiological visual responses in the late stages of retinal degeneration.

Here, the authors show that palmitic acid stimulates NASH by inhibiting PRDX1 to increase oxidative stress, while rosmarinic acid improves NASH by activating PRDX1 to reduce oxidative stress. 
 Reactive oxygen species exacerbate nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) by oxidizing macromolecules; yet how they promote NASH remains poorly understood. Here, we show that peroxidase activity of global hepatic peroxiredoxin (PRDX) is significantly decreased in NASH, and palmitic acid (PA) binds to PRDX1 and inhibits its peroxidase activity. Using three genetic models, we demonstrate that hepatic PRDX1 protects against NASH in male mice. Mechanistically, PRDX1 suppresses STAT signaling and protects mitochondrial function by scavenging hydrogen peroxide, and mitigating the oxidation of protein tyrosine phosphatases and lipid peroxidation. We further identify rosmarinic acid (RA) as a potent agonist of PRDX1. As revealed by the complex crystal structure, RA binds to PRDX1 and stabilizes its peroxidatic cysteine. RA alleviates NASH through specifically activating PRDX1’s peroxidase activity. Thus, beyond revealing the molecular mechanism underlying PA promoting oxidative stress and NASH, our study suggests that boosting PRDX1’s peroxidase activity is a promising intervention for treating NASH.

 G protein-coupled receptor 4 (GPR4) belongs to the subfamily of proton-sensing GPCRs (psGPCRs), which detect pH changes in extracellular environment and regulate diverse physiological responses. GPR4 was found to be overactivated in acidic tumor microenvironment as well as inflammation sites, with a triad of acidic residues within the transmembrane domain identified as crucial for proton sensing. However, the 3D structure remains unknown, and the roles of other conserved residues within psGPCRs are not well understood. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of active zebrafish GPR4 at both pH 6.5 and 8.5, each highlighting a distribution of histidine and acidic residues at the extracellular region. Cell-based assays show that these ionizable residues moderately influence the proton-sensing capacity of zebrafish GPR4, compared to the more significant effects of the triad residues. Furthermore, we reveal a cluster of aromatic residues within the orthosteric pocket that may propagate the signaling to the intercellular region via repacking the aromatic patch at the central region.

 L-band radiometer data collected by the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) missions have shown potential for mapping the spatial distribution and temporal changes of the above-ground biomass (AGB) of forests. Most studies focussed on the relationships observed between AGB and estimates of the vegetation optical depth (VOD) derived from L-band radiometer data. We here present an approach for retrieving AGB from SMOS and SMAP brightness temperatures which builds upon existing AGB retrieval frameworks developed for active microwave data. A physically-based model was adapted to relate brightness temperatures to the percent canopy cover and height available from space-borne optical and LiDAR missions and, via modelled relationships between canopy cover, height, and AGB, to AGB. An initial set of 36 global AGB maps was produced from 10-days composites of a polarimetric index calculated from H and V polarization SMOS and SMAP brightness temperatures acquired in 2016. When compared to an ESA Climate Change Initiative Biomass AGB map, the AGB estimates produced from SMOS and SMAP presented a reasonable agreement with low systematic biases and explained, dependent on the type of forest, between 30 % and 80 % of the AGB variability in the reference map. A comparison with AGB reference information derived from plot-level inventory data for a limited number of sites across the major forest biomes indicated the merit of the suggested retrieval approach but also revealed a need for improving the retrieval algorithm locally."

 Recent studies highlight the application of deriving the attenuation coefficient from spaceborne photon-counting lidar ATLAS/ICESat-2 over open oceans on global scales. However, its performance in the more optically complex and variable environments of marginal seas, which are more susceptible to human activity, has not been validated yet. In this study, we present an in-depth analysis of the consistency between diffuse attenuation coefficient (Kd) detection from MODIS and ICESat-2 in China's Marginal Seas. Findings demonstrate that ICESat-2 possesses strong capabilities for the retrieval of the attenuation coefficient across differing aquatic environments. However, discrepancies exist between the lidar system attenuation coefficient obtained from ICESat-2 and the diffuse attenuation coefficient determined by MODIS, influenced by factors such as multiple scattering. Implementation of a novel multiple scattering correction model demonstrates a notable ability in significantly reducing the inconsistency. Validation with in-situ Biogeochemical Argo float measurements reveals an enhancement in the accuracy of lidar-derived diffuse attenuation coefficients upon correction, with the mean absolute percent difference between lidar-derived Kd and Argo-Kd decreasing from 26 % to 15.7 %. The multiple scattering model developed can bridge the gap between the passive and active remote sensing detection and improve the reliability of lidar-derived attenuation coefficients. Fusing these two missions will greatly improve ocean observation capabilities, providing unprecedented opportunities for precise and comprehensive assessment of marine light environments. This approach has broad implications for ocean science and the application of satellite remote sensing in environmental studies."

 Haze contamination is a quite common issue in nighttime light remote sensing (NTLRS) images. It significantly limits the application of NTLRS images, especially in human activity monitoring and socio-economic studies. Furthermore, NTLRS images usually struggle with noise. Although many remote sensing image haze removal methods have been developed, to the best of our knowledge, very few studies have been conducted on haze removal of NTLRS images. In this study, to address haze in NTLRS images, particularly the challenging issue of concomitant noise contamination, we developed a nighttime light haze removal network (NTLHR-Net). Specifically, to capture effective spatial structural information (dominated by sparse or spot-like shapes) and eliminate joint haze and noise contamination, an encoder-decoder structure coupled with a mixture attention block was developed. Moreover, a multiscale convolutional block was employed iteratively in the middle of the encoder-decoder structure to distill the spatial structural information in high-dimensional spaces. In the experiments, the NTLHR-Net method was compared with seven state-of-the-art haze removal methods for both simulated and real hazy NTLRS images with different spatial structures. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed NTLHR-Net method in cases with various haze and noise contamination. This study provides a new solution for increasing the quality of the observed NTLRS images for downstream applications."

 In situations with a limited number of posed images, choosing the most suitable viewpoints becomes crucial for accurate Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) modeling. Current approaches for view selection often rely on heuristic methods or are computationally intensive. To address these challenges, we introduce a new framework, OptiViewNeRF, which leverages scene uncertainty to guide the view selection process. Initially, an uncertainty estimation model of the entire scene is developed based on a preliminary NeRF model. This model then informs the selection of new perception viewpoints using a batch view selection strategy, allowing the entire process to be completed in a single iteration. By selecting viewpoints that provide informative data, this approach improves novel view synthesis results and accurately reconstructs 3D scenes. Experimental results on two selected datasets show that the proposed method effectively identifies informative viewpoints, resulting in more accurate scene reconstructions compared to baseline and state-of-the-art methods."

 Effective identification and control of malaria vector larval breeding habitats are crucial for the management and eradication of malaria. Despite its importance, the last decade has seen a decline in data availability and intervention efforts due to reduced attention and prioritization. This study addresses the geographic data scarcity concerning Anopheles funestus larval breeding habitats in a malaria-prone region of western Kenya. Employing a two-step methodological approach, we integrated multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and rule-based fuzzy logic analysis to evaluate the spatiotemporal similarity or divergence of these habitats. The analysis spanned a five-year interval, 2008, 2013, and 2018 with 2013 serving as the base year for both hindcast and forecast predictions. The MCDA utilized categorical land use/land cover (LULC) and edaphic variables to identify potential breeding habitats, while climatic and topographic variables and spectral indices were analysed using fuzzy logic to assess the similarity or divergence of these habitats over time. Validation of the MCDA and fuzzy logic models was performed using a flight buffer distance based on adult An. funestus presence points (n = 136), supplemented by a limited number of larval breeding locations (n = 12) respectively. Our findings identified 147 potential An. funestus larval breeding habitats across the study area. The fuzzy logic analysis predicted a high degree of similarity (85.03%) in potential breeding habitats between the study years compared to the base year, with a divergence of 14.97%. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using semi-automated methods to detect both permanent and impermanent An. funestus breeding habitats under conditions of limited data. The methodologies developed provide a timely, cost-effective tool for enhanced surveillance and management of An funestus mosquito larval breeding, offering valuable insights for stakeholders involved in malaria vector monitoring and control."

 Water-based photovoltaics (WPV) have emerged as a promising solution to land-use conflicts associated with solar photovoltaic systems. Accurate monitoring of the spatiotemporal distribution of WPV is essential for evaluating its development potential, environmental impacts, and informing policy decisions. Satellite remote sensing data offer a feasible approach for WPV mapping and monitoring. However, conventional image classification and deep learning methods often limited by sample size requirements, computational costs, and technical complexity, which hinder their widespread applicability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel index, the normalized difference photovoltaic index (NDPI), for WPV detection. We generated a global WPV map for the year 2023 using Sentinel-2 MSI imagery and NDPI. Additionally, by integrating NDPI with Landsat time series data, we determined the installation dates of WPV systems and evaluated their development trends from 2000 to 2023. Our results show that: (i) The NDPI demonstrated excellent performance in WPV detection, with overall accuracy for spatial location and installation dates of WPV was 0.935 and 0.927, respectively, and Kappa coefficients of 0.870 and 0.921.

The increase in WPV area (434.57 km2) from 2015 to 2023 was nearly three times the total area covered in the previous 15 years. The proposed NDPI provides a universal approach for global WPV spatiotemporal monitoring and the update of basic information. It also provides potential for assessing the environmental impacts of WPV across its operational lifecycle."

 In this study we present and analyse a two-year dataset of NH3 exchange over a temperate Douglas fir forest in the Netherlands. The atmospheric NH3 concentration ([NH3]) was measured at multiple heights above the canopy in 2009 and 2010. We applied the aerodynamic gradient method combined with four different methods for roughness sublayer correction to calculate fluxes. The results with and without this correction were on average similar, but instantaneous differences can be up to 30%. We evaluated a 1-D inferential model (DEPAC). The reference run tended to overestimate deposition and did not predict emission. The observed stomatal emission potential (Γs) agrees well with values from literature and the modelled relation in DEPAC. The model performance strongly improved after implementation of a temperature dependent scaling factor in the external leaf pathway. We estimated the annual deposition load by combining observed and modelled fluxes and subsequent extrapolation of the mean (median) flux to be 11.8±3.5 (8.5±2.6) kg N ha−1 in 2009 and 11.4±3.4 (8.7±2.6) kg N ha−1 in 2010.

To mitigate the impact of these pollution episodes on the population, it is important to improve forecast systems that allow government authorities to take preventive actions, reducing the exposure of vulnerable groups. This study introduces a pilot operational ozone forecasting system based on machine learning. The proposed system is trained using historical data from a long-standing governmental air quality and atmospheric monitoring network, and with meteorological reanalysis data from a regional implementation of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model for Mexico. Additional input features are incorporated, including cyclical time encoding for the day of the week, time of day, and day of the year, to improve system accuracy. Once trained, the system utilizes real-time data from multiple atmospheric stations and regional meteorological forecasts to predict ozone levels for the following 24 h. This study evaluates the impact of data augmentation and the advantages of integrating meteorological forecast information into the model. The model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 9.81 ppb and an index of agreement of 0.91 across all stations. For the top 10 stations, the MAE falls below 8.7 ppb, and the index of agreement exceeds 0.93.
