10.1088/1748-9326/adaa8a,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇研究论文利用卫星观测数据（1985年至今）和统计模型，研究了全球平均海表温度（GMSST）的变化趋势。结果表明，GMSST的上升速率正在加快，这与地球能量收支的上升趋势有关。研究量化了GMSST的增加与累积能量之间的关系，并预测未来GMSST的上升速度可能快于过去几十年的线性外推结果。该研究强调了减少化石燃料燃烧以减缓全球变暖的紧迫性。总的来说，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它利用卫星观测数据来研究气候变化，并对地球的能量收支和海表温度变化进行了分析。,"['Sea surface temperature', 'Satellite observations', 'Climate change', ""Earth's energy imbalance"", 'Global warming']",Christopher J Merchant;Richard P Allan;Owen Embury,Quantifying the acceleration of multidecadal global sea surface warming driven by Earth’s energy imbalance,"Global mean sea surface temperature (GMSST) is a fundamental diagnostic of ongoing climate change, yet there is incomplete understanding of multi-decadal changes in warming rate and year-to-year variability. Exploiting satellite observations since 1985 and a statistical model incorporating drivers of variability and change, we identify an increasing rate of rise in GMSST. This accelerating ocean surface warming is physically linked to an upward trend in Earth’s energy imbalance (EEI). We quantify that GMSST has increased by 0.54 0.07 K for each GJ m–2 of accumulated energy, equivalent to 0.17 ± 0.02 K decade‒1 (W m‒2)‒1. Using the statistical model to isolate the trend from interannual variability, the underlying rate of change of GMSST rises in proportion with Earth’s energy accumulation from 0.06 K decade–1 during 1985–89 to 0.27 K decade–1 for 2019–23. While variability associated with the El Niño Southern Oscillation triggered the exceptionally high GMSSTs of 2023 and early 2024, 44% (90% confidence interval: 35%–52%) of the +0.22 K difference in GMSST between the peak of the 2023/24 event and that of the 2015/16 event is unexplained unless the acceleration of the GMSST trend is accounted for. Applying indicative future scenarios of EEI based on recent trends, GMSST increases are likely to be faster than would be expected from linear extrapolation of the past four decades. Our results provide observational evidence that the GMSST increase inferred over the past 40 years will likely be exceeded within the next 20 years. Policy makers and wider society should be aware that the rate of global warming over recent decades is a poor guide to the faster change that is likely over the decades to come, underscoring the urgency of deep reductions in fossil-fuel burning."

Petrenko;Kévin Fourteau;Philip Place,Preindustrial-to-present-day changes in atmospheric carbon monoxide: agreement and gaps between ice archives and global model reconstructions,"Carbon monoxide (CO) plays a crucial role in the atmosphere's oxidizing capacity. In this study, we analyse how historical (1850–2014) [CO] outputs from state-of-the-art global chemistry–climate models over Greenland and Antarctica are able to capture both absolute values and trends recorded in multi-site ice archives. A disparity in [CO] growth rates emerges in the Northern Hemisphere between models and observations from 1920–1975 CE, possibly linked to uncertainties in CO emission factors. 
 Global chemistry–climate models (CCMs) play an important role in assessing the climate and air pollution implications of aerosols and chemically reactive gases. Evaluating these models under past conditions and constraining historical sources and sinks necessitate reliable records of atmospheric mixing ratios spanning preindustrial times. Such precious records were recently obtained for carbon monoxide (CO), documenting for the first time the evolution of this reactive compound over the industrial era. In this study, we compare the simulated atmospheric surface CO mixing ratios ([CO]) from two different sets of chemistry–climate models and emissions within the frameworks of CMIP5 and of CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phases 5 and 6) to recent bipolar ice archive reconstructions for the period spanning 1850 to the present. We analyse how historical (1850–2014) [CO] outputs from 16 ACCMIP (Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison Project) models and 7 AerChemMIP (Aerosol Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project) models over Greenland and Antarctica are able to capture both absolute values and trends recorded in multi-site ice archives. While most models underestimate [CO] at northern high latitudes, a reduction in this bias is observed between the ACCMIP and the AerChemMIP exercise. Over the 1980–2010 CE period (common era; all subsequent years in the paper are reported in CE), trends in ice archive and firn air observations and AerChemMIP outputs align remarkably well at northern and southern high latitudes, indicating improved quantification of anthropogenic CO emissions and the main CO sink (OH oxidation) compared to ACCMIP. From 1850 to 1980, AerChemMIP models and observations consistently show increasing [CO] in both the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH), suggesting a robust understanding of the CO budget evolution. However, a divergence in the [CO] growth rate emerges in the NH between models and observations over the 1920–1980 period, attributed to uncertainties in CO emission factors (EFs), particularly EFs for the RCO (residential, commercial, and other) and transportation sectors, although we cannot totally rule out the possibility that the CO record based on the Greenland ice archives may be biased high by CO chemical production processes occurring in the ice prior to the measurements (i.e. in situ CO production). In the Southern Hemisphere, AerChemMIP models simulate an increase in atmospheric [CO] from 1850 to 1980 that closely reproduces the observations (22 ± 10 ppb and 13 ± 7 ppb, respectively). Such agreement supports CMIP6 biomass burning CO emission inventories, which do not reveal a peak in CO emissions in the late 19th century. Furthermore, both SH models and observations reveal an accelerated growth rate in [CO] during 1945–1980 relative to 1850–1945, likely linked to increased anthropogenic transportation emissions."

 In order to reduce the uncertainty of aerosol radiative forcing in global climate models, we need to better understand natural aerosol sources which are important to constrain the current and pre-industrial climate. Here, we analyse particle number size distributions (PNSDs) collected during a year (2015) across four coastal and inland Antarctic research bases (Halley, Marambio, Dome C and King Sejong). We utilise k-means cluster analysis to separate the PNSD data into six main categories. “Nucleation” and “bursting” PNSDs occur 28 %–48 % of the time between sites, most commonly at the coastal sites of Marambio and King Sejong where air masses mostly come from the west and travel over extensive regions of sea ice, marginal ice and open ocean and likely arise from new particle formation. “Aitken high”, “Aitken low” and “bimodal” PNSDs occur 37 %–68 % of the time, most commonly at Dome C on the Antarctic Plateau, and likely arise from atmospheric transport and ageing from aerosol originating likely in both the coastal boundary layer and free troposphere. “Pristine” PNSDs with low aerosol concentrations occur 12 %–45 % of the time, most commonly at Halley,  located at low altitudes and far from the coastal melting ice and influenced by air masses from the west. Not only the sea spray primary aerosols and gas to particle secondary aerosol sources, but also the different air masses impacting the research stations should be kept in mind when deliberating upon different aerosol precursor sources across research stations. We infer that both primary and secondary components from pelagic and sympagic regions strongly contribute to the annual seasonal cycle of Antarctic aerosols. Our simultaneous aerosol measurements stress the importance of the variation in atmospheric biogeochemistry across the Antarctic region."

Simulated power plant plume rise that considers temperature inversion layers improves results compared to observations (interior Alaska). Modelled surface concentrations are improved by representation of vertical mixing and emission estimates. Large increases in diesel vehicle emissions at temperatures reaching −35°C are required to reproduce observed NOx. 
 Lagrangian tracer simulations are deployed to investigate processes influencing vertical and horizontal dispersion of anthropogenic pollution in Fairbanks, Alaska, during the Alaskan Layered Pollution and Chemical Analysis (ALPACA) 2022 field campaign. Simulated concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx), including surface and elevated sources, are the highest at the surface under very cold stable conditions. Pollution enhancements above the surface (50–300 m) are mainly attributed to elevated power plant emissions. Both surface and elevated sources contribute to Fairbanks' regional pollution that is transported downwind, primarily to the south-west, and may contribute to wintertime Arctic haze. Inclusion of a novel power plant plume rise treatment that considers the presence of surface and elevated temperature inversion layers leads to improved agreement with observed CO and NOx plumes, with discrepancies attributed to, for example, displacement of plumes by modelled winds. At the surface, model results show that observed CO variability is largely driven by meteorology and, to a lesser extent, by emissions, although simulated tracers are sensitive to modelled vertical dispersion. Modelled underestimation of surface NOx during very cold polluted conditions is considerably improved following the inclusion of substantial increases in diesel vehicle NOx emissions at cold temperatures (e.g. a factor of 6 at −30 °C). In contrast, overestimation of surface SO2 is attributed mainly to model deficiencies in vertical dispersion of elevated (5–18 m) space heating emissions. This study highlights the need for improvements to local wintertime Arctic anthropogenic surface and elevated emissions and improved simulation of Arctic stable boundary layers."

This study uses a box model to evaluate how these emissions impact ozone in the Los Angeles Basin and quantifies the impact of gaseous cooking emissions. Accurate representation of these and other anthropogenic sources in inventories is crucial for informing effective air quality policies. 
 Volatile chemical products (VCPs) and other non-traditional anthropogenic sources, such as cooking, contribute substantially to the volatile organic compound (VOC) budget in urban areas, but their impact on ozone formation is less certain. This study employs Lagrangian box modeling and sensitivity analyses to evaluate ozone response to sector-specific VOC and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions in two Los Angeles (LA) Basin cities during the summer of 2021. The model simulated the photochemical processing and transport of temporally and spatially gridded emissions from the FIVE-VCP-NEI17NRT inventory and accurately simulates the variability and magnitude of O3, NOx, and speciated VOCs in Pasadena, CA. VOC sensitivity analyses show that anthropogenic VOCs (AVOC) enhance the mean daily maximum 8 h average ozone in Pasadena by 13 ppb, whereas biogenic VOCs (BVOCs) contribute 9.4 ppb. Of the ozone influenced by AVOCs, VCPs represent the largest fraction at 45 %, while cooking and fossil fuel VOCs are comparable at 26 % and 29 %, respectively. NOx sensitivity analyses along trajectory paths indicate that the photochemical regime of ozone varies spatially and temporally. The modeled ozone response is primarily NOx-saturated across the dense urban core and during peak ozone production in Pasadena. Lowering the inventory emissions of NOx by 25 % moves Pasadena to NOx-limited chemistry during afternoon hours and shrinks the spatial extent of NOx saturation towards downtown LA. Further sensitivity analyses show that using VOCs represented by a separate state inventory requires steeper NOx reductions to transition to NOx sensitivity, further suggesting that accurately representing VOC reactivity in inventories is critical to determining the effectiveness of future NOx reduction policies."

Dirksen,"Development of a Peltier-based chilled-mirror hygrometer, SKYDEW, for tropospheric and lower-stratospheric water vapor measurements","A Peltier-based chilled-mirror hygrometer, SKYDEW, has been developed to measure tropospheric and stratospheric water vapor. Continuous accurate measurements of water vapor are essential for climate monitoring. More than 40 soundings with SKYDEW have been conducted since 2011 to evaluate the performance. The result of soundings at tropical and midlatitudes demonstrated that SKYDEW is able to measure up to an altitude of 20–25 km for daytime soundings and above 25 km for nighttime soundings. 
 We have developed a Peltier-based non-cryogenic chilled-mirror hygrometer named SKYDEW to measure water vapor from the surface to the stratosphere. Several chamber experiments were conducted to investigate the characteristics and performance of the instrument under various conditions. The stability of the feedback controller that maintains the condensate on the mirror depends on the controller setting, the condensate condition, and the frost point in ambient air. The results of condensate observation by a microscope and proportional-integral-derivative (PID) tuning in a chamber were used to determine the PID parameters of the controller such that slight oscillations of the scattered light signal from the mirror and mirror temperature are retained. This allows for the detection of steep gradients in the humidity profile, which are otherwise not detected because of the slower response. The oscillation of the raw mirror temperature is smoothed with a golden point method that selects the equilibrium point of the frost layer. We further describe the details of the data processing and the uncertainty estimation for SKYDEW measurements in terms of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) Reference Upper-Air Network (GRUAN) requirements. The calibration uncertainty of the mirror temperature measurement is < 0.1 K for the entire temperature range from −95 to 40 °C. The total measurement uncertainty of SKYDEW measurements can exceed 0.5 K in regions where large oscillations of the mirror temperature remain.Intercomparisons with relative humidity (RH) sensors on radiosondes, the cryogenic frost point hygrometer (CFH), and the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) were performed at various latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere to evaluate the performance of SKYDEW. These results show that SKYDEW can reliably measure atmospheric water vapor up to 25 km altitude. Data from several SKYDEW and CFH measurements predominantly agree within their respective uncertainties, although a systematic difference of ∼ 0.5 K between SKYDEW and CFH was found in the stratosphere, the reason for which is unknown. SKYDEW shows good agreement with Aura MLS for profiles that are not affected by contamination."

Marushchak;Anna-Maria Virkkala;Martin Heimann;Mathias Göckede,Advancing N2O flux chamber measurement techniques in nutrient-poor ecosystems,"This study explores nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes from a nutrient-poor, sub-Arctic peatland. N2O is a potent greenhouse gas; understanding its fluxes is essential for addressing global warming. Using a new instrument and flux chambers, we introduce a system to reliably detect low N2O fluxes and provide recommendations on chamber closure times and flux calculation methods to better quantify N2O fluxes. We encourage researchers to further investigate N2O fluxes in low-nutrient environments. 
 Nitrous oxide (N2O) is the third most important greenhouse gas, with its atmospheric concentration rising from 273 parts per billion (ppb) to 336 ppb since 1800, primarily due to agricultural activities. However, nutrient-poor natural soils, including those in the sub-Arctic, also emit and consume N2O. These soils have not been studied extensively, partly due to challenges in reliably detecting low fluxes. Methodological limitations were largely influenced by the available instrumentation; the lack of portable gas analysers for N2O with adequate accuracy led researchers to rely on manual air sampling from closed flux chambers, followed by laboratory analysis using gas chromatographs (GC). In this study, we utilized a fast-responding portable gas analyser (PGA; Aeris N2O/CO2) combined with a custom manual chamber system, which includes both transparent (light) and opaque (dark) measurements, to effectively measure low N2O fluxes from a nutrient-poor sub-Arctic peatland. We assessed the analyser's performance under low-flux conditions, evaluated the effects of chamber closure times, and compared linear and non-linear models for quantifying concentration gradients. Additionally, we analyzed flux rates based on high-frequency in situ observations against a method that randomly selects discrete samples from the full time series, simulating a GC-based approach. Our results indicate that the PGA can reliably detect and compute low N2O flux rates, averaging 12.9 ± 28.4 nmol m⁻² h⁻¹ under light conditions and -46.1 ± 38.2 nmol m⁻² h⁻¹ under dark conditions, depending on chamber closure time. The majority of fluxes (88 % for light and 74 % for dark measurements) exceeded the minimum detectable flux (MDF), which was 14.5 ± 1.05 nmol m⁻² h⁻¹ for light and 14.7 ± 1.08 nmol m⁻² h⁻¹ for dark measurements. Our comparison of chamber closure times (3–10 minutes) showed that a 3-minute closure may be inadequate for capturing low N2O fluxes during light measurements, while closure times of 4–10 minutes yield more reliable results. For dark measurements, where N2O uptake peaked with shorter closure times, we recommend a closure time of 3–5 minutes unless data are limited; in such cases, longer times may help capture fluxes above the MDF. In our study, all N2O fluxes were calculated using the non-linear model or corresponded with the linear model when data exhibited a linear distribution. Compared to PGA-based flux calculations, GC simulations underestimated N2O fluxes when using 3–6 samples. Therefore, we conclude that fast-responding analysers may be more suitable for measuring low N2O fluxes, enhancing our understanding of the complex dynamics of N2O emissions."

The dataset includes emissions data for four types of greenhouse gases and five types of air pollutants. The data, available for research, offer valuable insights into ship emission spatiotemporal patterns by vessel type and age, providing a solid data foundation for fine-scale scientific research and shipping emission mitigation. 
 The high-resolution ship emission inventory serves as a crucial dataset for various disciplines including atmospheric science, marine science, and environmental management. Here, we present a global high-spatiotemporal-resolution ship emission inventory at a resolution of 0.1° × 0.1° for the years 2013 and 2016–2021, generated by the state-of-the-art Shipping Emission Inventory Model (SEIMv2.2). Initially, the annual 30 billion Automatic Identification System (AIS) data underwent extensive cleaning to ensure data validity and accuracy in temporal and spatial distribution. Subsequently, integrating real-time vessel positions and speeds from AIS data with static technical parameters, emission factors, and other computational parameters, SEIM simulated ship emissions on a ship-by-ship, signal-by-signal basis. Finally, the results were aggregated and analyzed. In 2021, the ship activity dataset established based on AIS data covered 109 300 vessels globally (101 400 vessels reported by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development). Concerning the major air pollutants and greenhouse gases, global ships emitted 847.2×106 t of CO2, 2.3×106 t of SO2, 16.1×106 t of NOx, 791.2 kt of CO, 737.3 kt of HC (hydrocarbon), 415.5 kt of primary PM2.5, 61.6 kt of BC (black carbon), 210.3 kt of CH4, and 45.1 kt of N2O in 2021, accounting for 3.2 % of SO2, 14.2 % of NOx, and 2.3 % of CO2 emissions from all global anthropogenic sources, based on the Community Emissions Data System (CEDS). Due to the implementation of fuel-switching policies, global ship emissions of SO2 and primary PM2.5 saw a significant reduction of 81.3 % and 76.5 % in 2021 compared to 2019, respectively. According to the inventory results, the composition of vessel types contributing to global ship emissions remained relatively stable through the years, with container ships consistently contributing ∼ 30 % of global ship emissions. Regarding vessel age distribution, the emission contribution of vessels built before 2000 (without Tier standards) has been declining, dropping to 10.2 % in 2021, suggesting that even a complete phase-out of these vessels would have limited potential for reducing NOx emissions in the short term. On the other hand, the emission contribution of vessels built after 2016 (meeting Tier III standard) kept increasing, reaching 13.3 % in 2021. Temporally, global ship emissions exhibited minimal daily fluctuations. Spatially, high-resolution emission characteristics of different vessel types were delineated. Patterns of ship emission contributions by different types of vessels vary among maritime regions, with container ships predominant in the North and South Pacific, bulk carriers predominant in the South Atlantic, and oil tankers prevalent in the Arabian Sea.

Bateni;Yeonjoo Kim,Global snow water equivalent product derived from machine learning model trained with in situ measurement data,"This study introduces a machine learning-based daily global gridded snow water equivalent (SWE) product (SWEML) at 0.25° from 1980 to 2020. Comparison of SWEML to other global SWE datasets showed that SWEML exhibited high accuracy, especially in mountainous and high-elevation areas, such as the Rocky Mountains in the US. In addition, SWEML effectively depicted snow accumulation during winters and snow melting during springs. 
 Snow water equivalent (SWE) quantifies the volume of water stored in snowpacks and therefore critically attributes to the timing and amount of water discharged into groundwater sources and rivers. The SWE has been estimated using various methods, including in situ measurements, remote sensing, and physics-based models. However, each of these methods present certain limitations, including high costs, low spatiotemporal resolution, and uncertainty in model representation and parameter calibration. To address these challenges, in this study, we developed a machine learning-based daily global gridded SWE (SWEML) product with a spatial resolution of 0.25°, covering the period from 1980 to 2020. To develop this product, we first applied the k-means clustering algorithm using topographical and climatic variables to classify global in situ SWE measurements into 13 clusters. Subsequently, we adopted the random forest algorithm to correlate daily in situ SWE measurements (n = 11,653) with meteorological forcing and terrain attributes. We compared SWEML with other SWE datasets, including the GlobSnow dataset from the European Space Agency, the Global Land Data Assimilation System dataset, and SWE estimates from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observation System. The overall root mean square error (RMSE) was 10.80 mm, and the overall bias was -6.89 mm globally, in particular, with high accuracy with Pearson correlation coefficient, R, of 0.99 and RMSE of 16.88 mm in mountainous and high-elevation areas, such as the Rocky Mountains in the U.S. Furthermore, both snow accumulation during winter and snow melting during spring, were well depicted in the SWEML, which is only possible with a high-temporal-resolution product. Overall, the daily gap-free global SWEML product introduced in this study can significantly contribute to water resource management efforts in snow-dominant regions and provide a robust reference for data assimilation in global-scale land surface modeling. The SWEML is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14195794 (Seo et al., 2024)."

Validated against multiple networks and datasets, it demonstrated superior accuracy. This dataset is vital for understanding soil moisture dynamics, especially during droughts, and highlights the need for improved modeling of clay soils to refine future predictions. 
 An improved fine-scale soil moisture (SM) dataset at 1-km grid spacing, covering much of the eastern continental U.S., was generated by assimilating 9-km SMAP SM data into the v4.0.1 Noah-MP land surface model. The assimilation, conducted using the Ensemble Kalman Filter algorithm within NASA’s Land Information System, involved 12 ensemble members. The SM analysis for 2016 was fully validated against in-situ observations from four different networks and compared with four other existing datasets. Results indicate that this SM analysis surpasses other datasets in top-layer SM distribution, including a machine learning-based product, despite all SM estimates being less heterogeneous than observed. The analysis of anomalous errors suggests that large similarity in intrinsic errors is likely due to overlapping data sources among the selected SM datasets. By assessing the product using the ARM SGP data, we show that soil temperature and surface heat fluxes are concurrently simulated in good accuracy. A specific investigation into the 2016 southeastern U.S. drought response further indicates drier conditions and higher evapotranspiration estimates compared to GLEAMv4.1. Notably, large errors are associated with grids having clay soil textures, highlighting the need for refined model treatments for specific soil types to further improve SM estimates."

Using advanced satellite data and innovative methods, a new high-resolution mean sea surface model was created. It achieves greater precision than previous models and offers valuable insights into Arctic oceanography. This research provides an important tool for understanding changes in the Arctic environment and their global impacts. 
 Due to the seasonal and perennial sea ice coverage in the Arctic Ocean, determining the sea surface height (SSH) is more difficult compared to mid- and low-latitude regions. This has resulted in a lack of high-precision, high-resolution mean sea surface (MSS) models for the Arctic Ocean. This paper focuses on the SSH in the ice-covered regions of the Arctic Ocean, using CryoSat-2 SAR mode altimeter data and MODIS images to develop a feature and threshold optimization method based on waveform characteristic method, combining mutual information and the F1 Score. This method detects lead observations in Baseline-E CryoSat-2 ice products with a precision of 90.79 % and a recall of 85.25 %. Using CryoSat-2 SAR mode altimeter data from July 2010 to December 2023, the lead observations are divided into 5-km grids for each month, and gross error observations in each grid are removed according to the two-sigma principle. The mean SSH for each month is calculated to establish a monthly mean SSH time series within each grid. Then, using least square estimation (LSE), a new MSS model with a grid size of 5 km is constructed, named SDUST 2024 MSS of Arctic Ocean (SDUST2024MSS_AO).

Folkert Boersma;Takashi Sekiya;Kazuyuki Miyazaki;Sander Houweling,Quantifying uncertainties in satellite NO2 superobservations for data assimilation and model evaluation,"Clustering high-resolution satellite observations into superobservations improves model validation and data assimilation applications. In our paper, we derive quantitative uncertainties for satellite NO2 column observations based on knowledge of the retrievals, including a detailed analysis of spatial error correlations and representativity errors. The superobservations and uncertainty estimates are tested in a global chemical data assimilation system and are found to improve the forecasts. 
 Satellite observations of tropospheric trace gases and aerosols are evolving rapidly. Recently launched instruments provide increasingly higher spatial resolutions, with footprint diameters in the range of 2–8 km and with daily global coverage for polar orbiting satellites or hourly observations from geostationary orbits. Often the modelling system has a lower spatial resolution than the satellites used, with a model grid size in the range of 10–100 km. When the resolution mismatch is not properly bridged, the final analysis based on the satellite data may be degraded. Superobservations are averages of individual observations matching the model's resolution and are functional to reduce the data load on the assimilation system. In this paper, we discuss the construction of superobservations, their kernels, and uncertainty estimates. The methodology is applied to nitrogen dioxide tropospheric column measurements of the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) instrument on the Sentinel-5P satellite. In particular, the construction of realistic uncertainties for the superobservations is non-trivial and crucial to obtaining close-to-optimal data assimilation results. We present a detailed methodology to account for the representation error when satellite observations are missing due to, e.g., cloudiness. Furthermore, we account for systematic errors in the retrievals leading to error correlations between nearby individual observations contributing to one superobservation. Correlation information is typically missing from the retrieval products, where an error estimate is provided for individual observations. The various contributions to the uncertainty are analysed from the spectral fitting and the estimate of the stratospheric contribution to the column and the air mass factor for which we find a typical correlation length of 32 km. The method is applied to TROPOMI data but can be generalized to other trace gases such as HCHO, CO, and SO2 and other instruments such as the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS), and the Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of POllution (TEMPO) instrument. The superobservations and uncertainties are tested in the Multi-mOdel Multi-cOnstituent Chemical (MOMO-Chem) data assimilation ensemble Kalman filter system. These are shown to improve forecasts compared to thinning or compared to assuming fully correlated or uncorrelated uncertainties within the superobservation. The use of realistic superobservations within model comparisons and data assimilation in this way aids the quantification of air pollution distributions, emissions, and their impact on climate."

We identified 347 significant correlations between 79 OHCs and 32 FAs, including 32 associations with long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are critical for cetacean health. Furthermore, 45 significant correlations were found between OHC levels and desaturated enzyme activities/lipogenic indexes, suggesting that OHCs may disrupt lipid metabolism in these cetaceans. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers as legacy flame retardants were major contributors to the OHC–FA relationships. Moreover, alternative halogenated flame retardants, as PBDE substitutes, may similarly impact FA metabolism, raising concerns regarding their safety.

However, their practical applications are often hindered by difficulties in separating viscous solid-phase products. This study introduces a novel nonaqueous absorbent system (PD/PZ/NMP) composed of 4-amino-1-methylpiperidine (PD), piperazine (PZ), and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), engineered to produce easily separable powdery products. The PD/PZ/NMP absorbent achieves a CO2 loading of 0.86 mol-CO2/mol-amine, with 91% of CO2 concentrated in the solid phase. It demonstrates excellent cyclic stability, maintaining a regeneration efficiency of 91% after five regeneration cycles, and reduces energy consumption by 52% compared with the conventional monoethanolamine absorbent. Remarkably, PZ plays a crucial role in regulating the crystal composition of solid-phase products, transforming them from a viscous state to a crystalline powder. Characterization and density functional theory analysis explain the crystal-phase regulation mechanism: PD absorbs CO2 to form zwitterions (PDH+COO–), affording viscous products, and PZ forms protonated amines (PZH+) and monocarbamates (PZCOO–), which interact with PDH+COO– via hydrogen bonding to form a crystalline powder.

However, the underlying mechanism has yet to be explored. Herein, the redirection and enhancement of the direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) pathway were evidenced, along with the upregulated electrochemical properties and structural proteins in the methanogenic consortia. Further, we found that PCs featured trade-off properties of “biopseudocapacitor” and “bioconductor” during thermal treatment, as endowed by the evolution of oxygen-containing functional groups (for charging and discharging) and graphitic structure (for conductivity). Correspondingly, their trade-off effect on mediating syntrophic methanogenesis (SM) was realized between the generally acknowledged bioconductor role and the pseudocapacitive effect, as highlighted by the enhanced SM of reduced PCs from more balanced electron exchange capacities. Consequently, a performance comparison of PCs obtained at 450, 650, and 850 °C in SM resulted in an optimized sample at 650 °C, where a 61.3 ± 1.8% increase in methane production rate and a 33.4 ± 1.1% decrease in lag time were observed. Microbiologically, DIET-active Methanothrix and Geobacteraceae flourished with the intra- and extracellular electron transport channels established. These findings provide new insights into the mediating mechanism and renewable potential of PCs in regulating energy-harvesting biochemical processes toward carbon neutrality."

Allergenic proteins released by various allergenic species play a critical role in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases and have been widely detected in the environmental matrix. However, the release, presence and interaction of environmental allergens with human body remain to be elucidated. In this study, we reported the widespread of allergen-harboring extracellular vesicles (EVs) in indoor dust from 75 households across five provinces in China. Particle size and abundance of EVs were correlated with specific environmental factors. EVs showed long persistence and high resistance to environmental stress. Metagenomics and metaproteomics data revealed that most indoor allergenic species released allergens within the EVs into dust. A higher abundance of allergenic species and their derived EVs was observed in urban areas compared to rural areas. ELISA confirmed the allergenic activity of the EV-associated allergens. Allergens are common components and even markers of EVs, as evidenced by the data compilation of various allergenic species. The proportion of EV-associated allergens varied across species. EVs facilitated allergen entry into epithelial cells. Intranasally administered EVs can be rapidly transported to the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. EV-associated allergens exhibited higher allergenicity compared with non-EV allergens. Our findings elucidate a vesicle pathway through which environmental allergens are released, persist, and trigger allergic responses within EVs."

Weber,Formation of Ozone and PM2.5 in Smoke from Prescribed Burning in the Southeastern United States,"Ground-based measurements of smoke from prescribed fires in the southeastern US during the burning seasons of 2021 through 2024 are used to assess ozone (O3) and PM2.5 mass formation and their changes with age in 69 smoke events. O3 production occurred in nearly all plumes (31 out of 32) measured between 12:00 and 18:00. The O3 to carbon monoxide ratio (ΔO3/ΔCO) increased from 5.32 to 143 ppb ppm–1 as plumes aged from 1 to 480 min, showing a rapid initial increase, doubling in approximately 60 min, followed by a gradual slow down. Residual O3 from daytime fires was detected during the evening and night, disrupting the typical nighttime O3 pattern. The ΔPM2.5 mass/ΔCO ratio ranged from 40.6 to 466 μg m–3 ppm–1. Little age-related change was observed in smoke measured at night with ΔPM2.5 mass/ΔCO levels similar to those observed at the time of emissions (132 μg m–3 ppm–1). However, in plumes of observed O3 enhancement during photochemically active periods (12:00–18:00), ΔPM2.5 mass/ΔCO followed a similar increasing trend as ΔO3/ΔCO, and the two were correlated (r2 = 0.5), although the O3 trend was more pronounced. For these data, a stronger correlation between ΔPM2.5 mass/ΔCO and age was found in plumes of higher PM2.5 concentration (PM2.5 mass > 35 μg m–3). The impact of the prescribed burning season in the southeast was evident in state-operated air quality monitors near burning areas, where PM2.5 mass concentrations were 25–30% higher than nonburning seasons. In contrast, changes in daily maximum 8 h O3 concentrations were less pronounced. Our data indicates that the formation of both O3 and PM2.5 frequently occurred in smoke from prescribed fires during photochemically active periods in the studied regions. These findings are significant, as exposure to O3 and PM2.5 can negatively impact human health."

Previous research has demonstrated disparities in ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure, with Black people, among others, exposed to higher concentrations; yet, it remains unclear how wildland fire smoke may contribute to additional disproportionate exposure. Here, we investigate the additional PM2.5 burden contributed by wildland fire smoke in the contiguous United States by race and ethnicity, urbanicity, median household income, and language spoken at home, using modeled total, non-fire, and fire PM2.5 concentrations from 2007 to 2018. Wildland fires contributed 7% to 14% of total population weighted PM2.5 concentrations annually, while non-fire PM2.5 concentrations declined by 24% over the study period. Wildland fires contributed to greater PM2.5 exposure for Black and American Indian or Alaska Native people and those who live in nonurban areas. Disproportionate mean non-fire PM2.5 concentrations for Black people (9.1 μg/m3, compared to 8.7 μg/m3 overall) were estimated to be further exacerbated by additional disproportionate concentrations from fires (1.0 μg/m3, compared to 0.9 μg/m3 overall).

In this study, we conducted a one-year observation of Hg deposition, by both throughfall and litterfall, in a forest located in Chongqing, an industrial hub in southwestern China, in 2021. We compared the results with observations made at the same sampling site in 2010–2011. The results showed that there were significant decreases in both Hg concentrations (from 115 μg·kg–1 to 80.2 μg·kg–1 for litterfall and from 68.4 ng·L–1 to 4.01 ± 2.09 ng·L–1 for throughfall) and Hg deposition fluxes (from 89.8 μg·m–2·yr–1 to 19.9 μg·m–2·yr–1 for total deposition, decreasing by 77.8%) in the forest from 2010 to 2021. The decrease in deposition might result from the synergistic effect of reduction in both anthropogenic (inventory-listed or nonquantitative) and re-emission sources. Over the decade since the initiation of the Minamata Convention on Mercury, atmospheric Hg levels have decreased significantly, mainly due to the co-benefits of conventional air pollutant control, indicating the effectiveness of China’s Hg pollution control policies."

This cohort study aimed to explore the long-term effect of exposure to four air pollutants, including lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), and benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P] on all-cause and cause-specific mortality. This study involved 497,056 participants from the UK Biobank cohort. We used the Cox proportional hazards model to calculate associations. Effects of joint exposure to heavy metals were estimated using  quantile g-computation. Shape of the exposure–response association was examined by fitting penalty splines, in both the total population and subpopulations stratified by age, sex, smoking status, and genetic factors. Modifying effects of age, sex, smoking status, and genetic factors were also examined. Over a median follow-up of 13.7 years, we identified 39,530 (8.0%) deaths. Exposure to mixtures of Pb, Cd, and Hg was associated with 1.040–1.154 times increased risk of all-cause cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, and respiratory disease mortality. Of the specific causes of mortality, Pb and Cd were most strongly associated with respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, followed by ischemic heart disease, CVD, and cancer. Hg and B(a)P seemed to exhibit lower toxicity compared with Pb and Cd. Exposure–response curves demonstrated monotonically increased risk for most mortality outcomes, though Hg was found to be nonlinearly associated with all-cause and stroke mortality. Age, smoking status, and genetic factors were found to modify the susceptibility to heavy metals. Our findings suggested that long-term exposure to heavy metals and B(a)P was monotonically associated with elevated risk of multiple mortality outcomes, indicating there may be no safe threshold for these chemicals. Substantial benefits to public health could be achieved through stringent environmental regulations and clean air initiatives."

Current mitigation strategies predominantly focus on reducing the availability of inorganic Hg (IHg) for Hg methylation, achieved primarily through Hg emission control and in situ Hg immobilization. While these IHg-targeted approaches have effectively reduced MeHg bioaccumulation and subsequent human exposure, their efficacy is largely undermined by Hg transformations and fluctuating environmental conditions due to the complex and protracted pathway linking IHg from environmental sources to MeHg at the point of human exposure. In light of recent advancements in MeHg-related transformations, we emphasize the development of MeHg-targeted strategies to improve the overall efficiency of Hg risk management in rice-paddy systems. MeHg-targeted strategies include microbial regulation to diminish net MeHg production, facilitating MeHg demethylation in soils, and promoting the in vivo MeHg degradation within rice plants. Although these approaches are still in their nascent stages, they hold significant promise due to their potential high mitigation efficacy and reduced uncertainties, owing to the shorter pathway between MeHg production and human exposure. Integrating IHg- and MeHg-targeted strategies offers a comprehensive and synergistic approach, paving the way for more effective mitigation of human exposure to MeHg in rice-paddy systems."

This study enrolled 571 newly diagnosed ACS cases and investigated the association of 12 PFAS with coronary stenosis severity and prognosis. Coronary stenosis was assessed via Gensini score (GS) and number of lesioned vessels (LVN). Prognosis was estimated by tracking major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Statistical analyses included ordered logistic regression, Cox regression, threshold effect models, Bayesian kernel machine regression, and quantile g-computation models. The adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework was applied to reveal the underlying mechanism. The results showed positive association between perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and coronary stenosis, with an odds ratio (95% confidence interval, CI) of 1.33 (1.06, 1.67) for GS and 1.36 (1.08, 1.71) for LVN. PFOS significantly increased the incidence of poor prognosis, with hazard ratios (95% CI) of 1.96 (1.34, 2.89) for MACE. Threshold effects were observed for PFAS on coronary stenosis and prognosis, with PFOS thresholds of 4.65 ng/mL for GS, 4.54 ng/mL for LVN, and 5.14 ng/mL for MACE, and 5.03 ng/mL for nonfatal myocardial infarction. PFAS mixture exposure increased the occurrence of MACE and nonfatal myocardial infarction. The AOP framework shows that PFAS may impact protein binding, the cytoskeleton, multicellular biological processes, and heart function. In summary, our study revealed the adverse effects of PFAS on the degree of coronary stenosis and prognosis in ACS and identified potentially relevant molecular loci."

Here, direct formation of the same DMPO adduct as that formed by genuine radical trapping of •OH is discovered, while quinones (i.e., 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ), methyl-BQ (2-Me-BQ, 2,5-Me-BQ, 2,6-Me-BQ), and chlorinated-BQ (2-Cl-BQ, 2,5-Cl-BQ, 2,6-Cl-BQ)) meet with the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO), independent of peroxides. According to differences in alcohol-derived adducts (e.g., DMPO-CH2OH or DMPO-OCH3) while alcohol is attacked by •OH or DMPO•+, a nonradical mechanism is proposed for the BQ/DMPO system. This is further evidenced by the mass spectrometry data in which DMPO-OCH3 has been identified in BQ (or chlorinated-BQ)/DMPO systems. 17O incorporation experiments verify that hydroxyl oxygen in DMPO-OH originates from water. The DMPO-OH adduct might be formed via direct oxidation and water substitution or one-electron oxidation and nucleophilic addition. This study provides a peroxide-independent alternative route leading to DMPO-OH adduct in quinone-based systems, which has profound implications for assessing adverse health effects and even biogeochemical impacts of quinones if EPR is applied."

Recoil leaders develop in lightning flash decayed channels. The propagation of a recoil leader depends on the charges stored at its tip and the conductivity of the decayed channel. When the recoil leader propagates over the entire channel, a subsequent return stroke happens. Recoil leaders very often cease propagating before they reach the ground, that is, only part of the decayed channel is reionized. The present work aims to analyze the herein named secondary recoil leader that connect with the primary recoil leaders and cause them to start propagating again. We believe that the secondary recoil leader injects additional charge into the primary recoil leader, allowing the recoil leader reionize the whole decayed channel of the lightning flash. High‐speed videos analysis of upward lightning flashes shows that secondary recoil leaders play an important role on the formation and progression of dart leaders/subsequent return strokes."

Whether and to what extent the horizontal and vertical shifts of vegetation isolines keep pace with the temperature and precipitation isolines, as well as hidden mechanisms remain elusive. Analyzing the greenness and climate data over 1986–2020, our study reveals widespread mismatch, with 76.9% (87.1%) of horizontal greenness isolines lagged or diverged from temperature (precipitation) isolines. Similarly, 55.8% (77.9%) of vertical isolines showed lagging or diverging patterns relative to temperature (precipitation) isolines. Horizontal shifts in vegetation isolines were influenced by slope, precipitation and grazing intensity; while their vertical shifts were primarily driven by water‐related factors that mitigate warming effects.

10.1029/2024GL113406,True,Geophysical Research Letters,这篇论文利用更新后的C‐LSAT数据集（版本2.1）系统评估了自1900年以来全球和大陆尺度上的长期DTR（昼夜温差）变化趋势。研究结果表明，数据覆盖范围的改进（尤其是在2014年之后）以及数据同化，显著提高了全球和区域DTR评估的可靠性。研究发现，自1900年以来，全球平均DTR以每十年−0.025°C的速度下降，其中1950年代至1980年代下降最为显著，亚洲和非洲尤其明显。然而，近几十年来，DTR趋势发生了逆转，自1998年以来，全球DTR以每十年0.136°C的速度增长，欧洲、北美和南半球尤为突出。该研究证实了先前关于DTR趋势及其成因的研究，并提供了更新、可靠的全球和区域变化估计值。虽然文章没有直接提及具体的卫星传感器名称，但其使用的C-LSAT数据集很可能整合了来自不同卫星和地面观测站的温度数据，这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['temperature', 'Diurnal Temperature Range (DTR)', 'climate change', 'satellite remote sensing', 'surface temperature', 'data homogenization', 'spatial heterogeneity']",Qiya Xu;Sihao Wei;Zichen Li;Qingxiang Li,A New Evaluation of Observed Changes in Diurnal Temperature Range,"Due to spatial heterogeneity, the global diurnal temperature range (DTR) change trends vary across data sets. By updating the C‐LSAT data set to version 2.1, this study systematically evaluates long‐term DTR trends at global and continental scales since 1900. The results indicate that improvements in temporal and spatial data coverage, particularly after 2014, along with data homogenization, have significantly enhanced the reliability of global and regional DTR assessments. Since 1900, the global mean DTR has declined at a rate of −0.025°C per decade, with the most pronounced decreases observed from the 1950s to the 1980s, especially in Asia and Africa. However, in recent decades, DTR trends have reversed, with the global DTR increasing at a rate of 0.136°C per decade since 1998, particularly in Europe, North America, and the Southern Hemisphere.

 Motivated by the inherent benefits of synergistically combining electrochemical methodologies with nickel catalysis, we present here a Ni-catalyzed enantioselective electroreductive cross-coupling of benzyl chlorides with aryl halides, yielding chiral 1,1-diaryl compounds with good to excellent enantioselectivity. This catalytic reaction can not only be applied to aryl chlorides/bromides, which are challenging to access by other means, but also to benzyl chlorides containing silicon groups. Additionally, the absence of a sacrificial anode lays a foundation for scalability. The combination of cyclic voltammetry analysis with electrode potential studies suggests that NiI species activate aryl halides via oxidative addition and alkyl chlorides via single electron transfer.

 Creating durable, motion-compliant neural interfaces is crucial for accessing dynamic tissues under in vivo conditions and linking neural activity with behaviors. Utilizing the self-alignment of nano-fillers in a polymeric matrix under repetitive tension, here, we introduce conductive carbon nanotubes with high aspect ratios into semi-crystalline polyvinyl alcohol hydrogels, and create electrically anisotropic percolation pathways through cyclic stretching. The resulting anisotropic hydrogel fibers (diameter of 187 ± 13 µm) exhibit fatigue resistance (up to 20,000 cycles at 20% strain) with a stretchability of 64.5 ± 7.9% and low electrochemical impedance (33.20 ± 9.27 kΩ @ 1 kHz in 1 cm length). We observe the reconstructed nanofillers’ axial alignment and a corresponding anisotropic impedance decrease along the direction of cyclic stretching. We fabricate fiber-shaped hydrogels into bioelectronic devices and implant them into wild-type and transgenic Thy1::ChR2-EYFP mice to record electromyographic signals from muscles in anesthetized and freely moving conditions. These hydrogel fibers effectively enable the simultaneous recording of electrical signals from ventral spinal cord neurons and the tibialis anterior muscles during optogenetic stimulation. Importantly, the devices maintain functionality in intraspinal electrophysiology recordings over eight months after implantation, demonstrating their durability and potential for long-term monitoring in neurophysiological studies.

 Unraveling the signaling roles of intermediate complexes is pivotal for G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) drug development. Despite hundreds of GPCR-Gαβγ structures, these snapshots primarily capture the fully activated complex. Consequently, the functions of intermediate GPCR-G protein complexes remain elusive. Guided by a conformational landscape visualized via 19F quantitative NMR and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we determined the structure of an intermediate GPCR-mini-Gαsβγ complex at 2.6 Å using cryo-EM, by blocking its transition to the fully activated complex. Furthermore, we present direct evidence that the complex at this intermediate state initiates a rate-limited nucleotide exchange before transitioning to the fully activated complex. In this state, BODIPY-GDP/GTP based nucleotide exchange assays further indicated the α-helical domain of the Gα is partially open, allowing it to grasp a nucleotide at a non-canonical binding site, distinct from the canonical nucleotide-binding site. These advances bridge a significant gap in our understanding of the complexity of GPCR signaling.

Here, the authors report the ferromagnetic Fe-TiO2 to investigate magnetic field effect on electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate for ammonia. 
 Magnetic field effects (MFE) of ferromagnetic spin electrocatalysts have attracted significant attention due to their potential to enhance catalytic activity under an external magnetic field. However, no ferromagnetic spin catalysts have demonstrated MFE in the electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate for ammonia (NO3RR), a pioneering approach towards NH3 production involving the conversion from diamagnetic NO3− to paramagnetic NO. Here, we report the ferromagnetic Fe-TiO2 to investigate MFE on NO3RR. Fe-TiO2 possesses a high density of atomically dispersed Fe sites and exhibits an intermediate-spin state, resulting in magnetic ordering through ferromagnetism. Assisted by a magnetic field, Fe-TiO2 achieves a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of up to 97% and an NH3 yield of 24.69 mg mgcat−1 at −0.5 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Compared to conditions without an external magnetic field, the FE and NH3 yield for Fe-TiO2 under an external magnetic field is increased by ~21.8% and ~ 3.1 times, respectively. In-situ characterization and theoretical calculations show that spin polarization enhances the critical step of NO hydrogenation to NOH by optimizing electron transfer pathways between Fe and NO, significantly boosting NO3RR activity.

 High-rate quantum error correcting (QEC) codes with moderate overheads in qubit number and control complexity are highly desirable for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing. Recently, quantum error correction has experienced significant progress both in code development and experimental realizations, with neutral atom qubit architecture rapidly establishing itself as a leading platform in the field. Scalable quantum computing will require processing with QEC codes that have low qubit overhead and large error suppression, and while such codes do exist, they involve a degree of non-locality that has yet to be integrated into experimental platforms. In this work, we analyze a family of high-rate Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes with limited long-range interactions and outline a near-term implementation in neutral atom registers. By means of circuit-level simulations, we find that these codes outperform surface codes in all respects when the two-qubit nearest neighbour gate error probability is below  ~ 0.1%. By using multiple laser colors, we show how these codes can be natively integrated in two-dimensional static neutral atom qubit architectures with open boundaries, where the desired long-range connectivity can be targeted via the Rydberg blockade interaction.

 The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a comprehensive framework for societal progress and planetary health. However, it remains unclear whether universal patterns exist in how nations pursue these goals and whether key development areas are being overlooked. Here, we apply the product space methodology, widely used in development economics, to construct an ‘SDG space of nations’. The SDG space models the relative performance and specialization patterns of 166 countries across 96 SDG indicators from 2000 to 2022. Our SDG space reveals a polarized global landscape, characterized by distinct groups of nations, each specializing in specific development indicators. Furthermore, we find that as countries improve their overall SDG scores, they tend to modify their sustainable development trajectories, pursuing different development objectives. Additionally, we identify orphaned SDG indicators — areas where certain country groups remain under-specialized. These patterns, and the SDG space more broadly, provide a high-resolution tool to understand and evaluate the progress and disparities of countries towards achieving the SDGs.

 The 2023 Türkiye earthquake doublet, which includes two MW > 7.5 events, was the most devastating earthquake sequence globally over the past decade. Here we investigate the fault segmentations, rupture processes, radiated energy and stress releases of the doublet. Our findings reveal that the first earthquake was overall a subshear event, with local supershear ruptures that may have been induced by geometric barriers, while the second event exhibited persistent supershear ruptures on its geometrically simple segments. The difference in radiation efficiency between the two events suggests that the first event may be an undershoot event and/or that the second event may be an overshoot event. We speculate that the geometric barriers of the first event hindered the stress release, leading to rupture of more small asperities and generation of high-frequency signals. In contrast, the simpler fault geometry of the second event facilitates a larger stress drop and a more complete stress release.

 About half of the global drinking water comes from groundwater, yet groundwater quality is threatened by high nitrate concentrations globally. Our understanding of groundwater nitrate concentrations is often limited by inaccessibility of groundwater and scarcity of nitrate data in groundwater. Here we used machine learning and decision tree-heatmap analysis by compiling nitrate concentrations and isotope data from 4047 groundwater sites across China to understand their dynamics and drivers across gradients of geographical, climate, and human factors. Results show that nitrate concentrations vary substantially over depth and are generally lower in deeper groundwater, indicating potentially higher nitrate removal rates according to nitrate isotopic pattern such as denitrification at depth. At similar groundwater aquifer depths, nitrate concentrations are highest in urban regions with high population density. In addition, nitrate concentrations are generally higher in arid northern China than humid southern China. Interestingly, while groundwater nitrate concentrations are lower at deeper depths, slow groundwater flow also indicates prolonged nitrogen legacy. Although there has been an overall decline in groundwater nitrogen pollution in China since 2016, persistent pollution has lingered. Future strategies for groundwater quality protection in China should address the long-term legacy of nitrate in different aquifers and rising nitrogen levels in groundwater.

 Conserving Southeast Asia’s mangroves is a vital natural climate solution, and their protection could be supported by blue carbon credits.

Using opportunity costs associated with oil palm, rice and aquaculture land use conversion as indicators of socioeconomic risks, and predicted cyclones and sea-level rise as indicators of climate change risks, we find that 85% of mangroves are likely to experience some form of permanence risk.

 High-titanium mare basalts were among the earliest rocks to be returned from the Moon, but key aspects of their formation remain enigmatic.

 Leaf-wood separation plays an important role in estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) of trees from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) point clouds. Yet, leaf-wood separation studies have predominantly focused on reporting the accuracy of leaf and wood point separation. Assessments of the impact of these algorithms on the subsequent AGB estimations, based on commonly used quantitative structure models (QSMs), have been limited. Therefore, in this study, we quantified the impact of 11 published leaf-wood separation algorithms on QSM-based tree AGB estimation using an independent benchmarking dataset. The benchmarking dataset consists of AGB measured for 20 destructively harvested trees from a mixed temperate forest in Harvard Forest and AGB estimated from QSMs built on manually segmented tree point clouds of 856 broadleaved trees in Wytham Woods under leaf-off conditions. These benchmarking AGB values were compared to the AGB estimated from QSMs built on the leaf-removed point clouds resulting from the different separation algorithms performed on the leaf-on tree point clouds of the same trees. The results of the study indicated that for most of the algorithms, the leaf-removed AGB estimates for both coniferous and broadleaved trees underestimated the AGB (conifers: −17 % to −3 %, broadleaf: −14 % to −2 %) compared to the destructively measured AGB in Harvard Forest. In Wytham Woods, leaf-removed AGB estimates from all separation algorithms consistently underestimated the AGB (−46 % to −24 %) compared to the AGB from the leaf-off point clouds. Most leaf-wood separation algorithms performed better on broadleaved trees than on coniferous trees. Moreover, significant differences were observed among different algorithms in estimating AGB for trees of the same forest type. For coniferous trees, the relative difference (RD) of leaf-removed AGB estimates from QSMs and separation algorithms ranged from −27 % to 16 %, among which the best performing algorithms demonstrated similar optimal performance, with small RD values of approximately −3 % to 2 %. For broadleaved trees, the leaf-removed AGB estimates from QSMs and eight separation algorithms, as well as leaf-off point cloud estimates (approximately at 10 %), were closely in agreement with the harvested benchmark values, among which the best performing algorithms had a RD value approximately within ±2 %. Additionally, most separation algorithms could lead to better estimates of trunk biomass than branch biomass, whereas the estimation for branch biomass consistently exhibited varying degrees of underestimation. These findings provide a timely reference for utilizing leaf-wood separation algorithms for QSM-based AGB estimation."

 Accurate crop yield prediction is of utmost importance for informed decision-making in agriculture, aiding farmers, industry stakeholders, and policymakers in optimizing agricultural practices. However, this task is complex and depends on multiple factors, such as environmental conditions, soil properties, and management practices. Leveraging Remote Sensing (RS) technologies, multi-modal data from diverse global data sources can be collected to enhance predictive model accuracy. However, combining heterogeneous RS data poses a fusion challenge, like identifying the specific contribution of each modality in the predictive task. In this paper, we present a novel multi-modal learning approach to predict crop yield for different crops (soybean, wheat, rapeseed) and regions (Argentina, Uruguay, and Germany). Our multi-modal input data includes multi-spectral optical images from Sentinel-2 satellites and weather data as dynamic features during the crop growing season, complemented by static features like soil properties and topographic information. To effectively fuse the multi-modal data, we introduce a Multi-modal Gated Fusion (MMGF) model, comprising dedicated modality-encoders and a Gated Unit (GU) module. The modality-encoders handle the heterogeneity of data sources with varying temporal resolutions by learning a modality-specific representation. These representations are adaptively fused via a weighted sum. The fusion weights are computed for each sample by the GU using a concatenation of the multi-modal representations. The MMGF model is trained at sub-field level with 10 m resolution pixels. Our evaluations show that the MMGF outperforms conventional models on the same task, achieving the best results by incorporating all the data sources, unlike the usual fusion results in the literature. For Argentina, the MMGF model achieves an R2 value of 0.68 at sub-field yield prediction, while at the field level evaluation (comparing field averages), it reaches around 0.80 across different countries. The GU module learned different weights based on the country and crop-type, aligning with the variable significance of each data source to the prediction task. This novel method has proven its effectiveness in enhancing the accuracy of the challenging sub-field crop yield prediction. Our investigation indicates that the gated fusion approach promises a significant advancement in the field of agriculture and precision farming."

 We present a new method for estimating biophysical parameters from Earth Observation (EO) data using a crop-specific empirical model based on the PROSAIL Radiative Transfer (RT) model, called an ‘archetype’ model. The first-order model presented uses maximum biophysical parameter magnitude, phenological and soil parameters to describe the spectral reflectance (400–2500 nm) of vegetation over time. The approach assumes smooth variation and archetypical coordination of crop biophysical parameters over time for a given crop. The form of coordination is learned from a large sample of observations. Using Sentinel-2 observations of maize from Northeast China in 2019, we map reflectance to biophysical parameters using an inverse model operator, synchronise the parameters to a consistent time frame using a double logistic model of LAI, then derive the model archetypes as the median value of the synchronised samples. We apply the model to estimate time series of biophysical parameters for different cereal crops using an ensemble framework with a weighted K-nearest neighbour solution, and validate the results with ground measurements of different crops collected near Munich, Germany in 2017 and 2018. The results show R values greater than 0.8 for leaf area index (LAI) and leaf brown pigment content (Cbrown), with an RMSE of 0.94 m2/m2 for LAI and 0.15 for Cbrown. The chlorophyll content (Cab) and canopy water content (CCw) were retrieved at a higher level of accuracy, with R values around 0.9 and an RMSE of 6.59μg/cm2 for Cab and 0.03 g/cm2 for CCw. Comparison of forward-modelled hyperspectral reflectance with independent ground measures shows that the retrieved parameters account for 90% of the variation in canopy reflectance, with an overall RMSE of around 0.05 in reflectance units. The retrievals for all terms are mostly within 1σ when measurement and prediction uncertainty are taken into account, except for some early and late season issues in leaf and canopy water due to the complexity of canopy structure and understory during these periods. The approach provides a new form of constraint for the simultaneous estimation of biophysical parameters from EO and greatly reduces the rank of the problem. It is suitable for monitoring crop conditions where biophysical parameters vary smoothly over time consistently with each archetype form. The approach can be refined for other canopy types and canopy representations and could provide strong constraints on expected smoothly-varying canopy features to aid in the interpretation of EO signals across different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum."

 OpenStreetMap (OSM) contains valuable geographic knowledge for remote sensing (RS) interpretation. They can provide correlated and complementary descriptions of a given region. Integrating RS images with OSM data can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of a geographic scene. But due to the significant differences between them, little progress has been made in data fusion for RS and OSM data, and how to extract, interact, and collaborate the information from multiple geographic data sources remains largely unexplored. In this work, we focus on designing a multi-modal self-supervised learning (SSL) approach to fuse RS images and OSM data, which can extract meaningful features from the two complementary data sources in an unsupervised manner, resulting in comprehensive scene understanding. We harmonize the parts of information extraction, interaction, and collaboration for RS and OSM data into a unified SSL framework, named Rose. For information extraction, we start from the complementarity between the two modalities, designing an OSM encoder to harmoniously align with the ViT image encoder. For information interaction, we leverage the spatial correlation between RS and OSM data to guide the cross-attention module, thereby enhancing the information transfer. For information collaboration, we design the joint mask-reconstruction learning strategy to achieve cooperation between the two modalities, which reconstructs the original inputs by referring to information from both sources. The three parts are interlinked and blending seamlessly into a unified framework. Finally, Rose can generate three kinds of representations, i.e., RS feature, OSM feature, and RS-OSM fusion feature, which can be used for multiple downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on land use semantic segmentation, population estimation, and carbon emission estimation tasks demonstrate the multitasking capability, label efficiency, and robustness to noise of Rose. Rose can associate RS images and OSM data at a fine level of granularity, enhancing its effectiveness on fine-grained tasks like land use semantic segmentation.

 Offset tracking using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) amplitude imagery is a valuable technique for detecting large ground displacements. However, the traditional offset tracking methods with the SAR datasets are computationally intensive and require significant time for processing. We have developed a novel cross-connection Siamese ResNet (CC-ResSiamNet). The model leverages multi-kernel offset tracking for preprocessing, followed by deep learning architectures that incorporate U-Net, cross-connections, and residual and attention blocks to predict pixel offsets between two SAR amplitude images. It is trained and tested on 200 K pairs of reference and secondary SAR amplitude images, alongside corresponding target offset data from Alaska's glaciers. The comparative analysis with multiple deep learning models confirmed that our designed model is highly generalizable, achieving rapid convergence, minimal overfitting, and high prediction accuracy. Through multi-scenario inference with glacier movements, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions worldwide, the model demonstrates strong performance, closely matching the accuracy of traditional methods while offering significantly faster processing times through parallel computing. The model's rapid displacement mapping capability shows particular promise for improving disaster response and near real-time surface monitoring. While the approach encounters challenges in accurately capturing small-scale displacements, it opens new possibilities for SAR-based surface displacement prediction using machine learning.

 Arctic permafrost soils contain a vast reservoir of soil organic carbon (SOC) vulnerable to increasing mobilization and decomposition from polar warming and permafrost thaw. How these SOC stocks are responding to global warming is uncertain, partly due to a lack of information on the distribution and status of SOC over vast Arctic landscapes. Soil moisture and organic matter vary substantially over the short vertical distance of the permafrost active layer. The hydrological properties of this seasonally thawed soil layer provide insights for understanding the dielectric behavior of water inside the soil matrix, which is key for developing more effective physics-based radar remote sensing retrieval algorithms for large-scale mapping of SOC. This study provides a coupled hydrologic-electromagnetic framework to model the frequency-dependent dielectric behavior of active layer organic soil. For the first time, we present joint measurement and modeling of the water matric potential, dielectric permittivity, and basic physical properties of 66 soil samples collected across the Alaskan Arctic tundra. The matric potential measurement allows for estimating the soil water retention curve, which helps determine the relaxation time through the Eyring equation. The estimated relaxation time of water molecules in soil is then used in the Debye model to predict the water dielectric behavior in soil. A multi-phase dielectric mixing model is applied to incorporate the contribution of various soil components. The resulting organic soil dielectric model accepts saturation water fraction, organic matter content, mineral texture, temperature, and microwave frequency as inputs to calculate the effective soil dielectric characteristic. The developed dielectric model was validated against lab-measured dielectric data for all soil samples and exhibited robust accuracy. We further validated the dielectric model against field-measured dielectric profiles acquired from five sites on the Alaskan North Slope. Model behavior was also compared against other existing dielectric models, and an in-depth discussion on their validity and limitations in permafrost soils is given. The resulting organic soil dielectric model was then integrated with a multi-layer electromagnetic scattering forward model to simulate radar backscatter under a range of soil profile conditions and model parameters. The results indicate that low frequency (P-, L-band) polarimetric synthetic aperture radars (SARs) have the potential to map water and carbon characteristics in permafrost active layer soils using physics-based radar retrieval algorithms."

 Melt ponds are a common phenomenon on the surface of Arctic sea ice during the summer, and their low albedo strongly influences the energy balance of the Arctic sea ice. Estimating Melt Pond Fraction (MPF) and Melt Pond Depth (MPD) using optical remote sensing is crucial for a better understanding of rapid climate change in the Arctic region. However, current retrieval algorithms for monitoring Arctic melt ponds using optical imagery often fail to estimate MPD. In this study, a radiative transfer model for melt ponds is establish to describe the relationship between melt pond reflectance and its physical properties. Using Sentinel-2 observation data, we propose a novel algorithm for the simultaneous retrieval of MPF and MPD, thereby enabling the estimation of Melt Pond Volume (MPV). This method does not depend on prior assumptions regarding the spectral reflectance of sea ice and melt ponds, and it accounts for the spatiotemporal variability in their reflectance. Compared with other high-resolution MPF and MPD products, the results of this study demonstrate comparable spatial distributions. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the retrieved MPF is less than 10 %, and the RMSE for MPD is approximately 24.51 cm. The analysis of melt pond evolution along the MOSAiC track shows the rapid expansion of melt ponds and their significant spatial variability. Ultimately, using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and machine learning, a dataset of MPF, MPD, and MPV for the Arctic from 2013 to 2023 is generated from 57,842 Landsat-8 images. Correlation analysis shows that MPF, MPD, and MPV all have a positive correlation with downward surface radiation. The approach outlined in this study is entirely based on remote sensing imagery, demonstrating significant potential for large scale application. This offers new opportunities for estimating the volume of water stored in Arctic summer melt ponds."

 Built-up heights serve as a nexus in understanding the complex relationship between urban forms and socioeconomic activities. With the advent of remote sensing technology, built-up height mapping from satellite observations has become available over the past years. However, the absence of high-precision sample data poses a significant limitation to built-up height mapping at large (regional or global) scales, particularly in developing regions. To address this issue, we proposed a flexible mapping framework to derive precise building height samples using the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) data for built-up height estimation. First, we calculated building heights from ICESat-2 photons using advanced algorithms such as Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) linear fitting and cloth simulation filtering. Then, we constructed large-scale built-up height samples by aggregating the height information into grid cells with optimal size. Finally, aided by these grids with height information from ICEsat-2 and other satellite observations from Sentinel data as well as the digital surface model (DSM), we mapped built-up heights in two mega-cities (i.e., New York and Shenzhen) using the random forest regression model. Our results demonstrate building height estimation using ICESat-2 data generally exhibits in relation to other studies high accuracy, showing great potential to support large-scale built-up height mapping using satellite observations. We found the optimal grid size for built-up height mapping is around 300 m, after a comprehensive sensitivity analysis regarding the building fraction within the grid and its size. Overall, the mapped built-up heights are reliable, with relatively low mean absolute errors (MAE) of 2.69 m in New York and 3.87 m in Shenzhen, similar to or better than previous studies. By leveraging high-precision elevation data provided by the ICESat-2 data, our proposed approach can effectively collect samples in regions with limited information on building heights, showing great potential for large-scale built-up height monitoring and supporting future urban studies."

 The three-runway system expansion project of the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) began with the land reclamation to the north of its original runway. To facilitate quick stabilization, the Deep Cement Mixing (DCM) in this project was featured as the novel reclamation method firstly applied in Hong Kong. Understanding ground deformation and underground consolidation is crucial for subsequent soil improvement, civil construction, and future planning at the new platform. Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) is used to investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of land deformation following the completion of the third runway pavement. A combined strategy of persistent scatterer (PS) and distributed scatterer (DS) interferometry was implemented to address low radar coherence at the site. The new reclamation is subject to varying degrees of land subsidence, with a maximum monitored sinking rate to be ∼150 mm/year during September 2021 and October 2023. Whereas the 3rd runway was urgently transformed to operation, spatial details of consolidation status of this new land were not yet evaluated. We applied the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to identify the underlying sources leading to the measured deformation from InSAR. Three distinct sources have been unveiled, including an exponential decay signal (a quick compaction subsidence of surficial materials), a linear signal (a continuous subsiding from marine deposits) and a periodic signal (thermal effects correlated with buildings and bridges). Notably, the linear deformation component is mainly located in areas with prefabricated vertical drains (PVD), which is strongly correlating with the current monitored subsidence pattern. We incorporated the Terzaghi consolidation theory to further characterize InSAR displacement and estimate the subsidence decay property, consolidation time, ultimate primary settlement and consolidation degree at the 3rd runway, with unprecedented spatial details. Our results indicate the DCM method achieves geological stability more rapidly than the PVD method, with a time advantage of approximately 0.08–1.39 years. Meanwhile, DCM can effectively control the primary settlement to 29 % - 83 % of the PVD method. This research benefits our understanding of the consolidation process at the 3rd runway and offer reliable and detailed data of underground properties. This facilitates more accurate planning of follow-up reinforcement measures at specific locations if needed, which also serves as a valuable reference for future reclamation practices in Hong Kong, particularly using the DCM method."

SARM first composites high-quality dual-aspect Sentinel-1 time series by combining ascending and descending orbits and smoothing temporal noises. Second, SARM embeds a novel terrain-adjustment modeling to mitigate confounding terrain effects on the SAR intensity of sloped pixels. Third, SARM quantifies unique shape and intensity features of SAR signals during the leaf-flower-pod period to estimate the probability of rapeseed cultivation with the aid of automatically extracted local high-confidence rapeseed pixels. SARM was tested at three sites with varying topographic conditions, rapeseed phenology and cultivation systems. Results demonstrate that SARM achieved accurate rapeseed mapping with the overall accuracy 0.9 or higher, and F1 score 0.85 or higher at all three sites. Compared with the existing rapeseed mapping methods, SARM excelled in mapping fragmented rapeseed fields in both flat and sloped terrains. SARM utilizes unique and universal SAR time-series features of rapeseed growth without relying on any prior knowledge or pre-collected training samples, making it flexible and robust for cross-regional rapeseed mapping, especially for cloudy and mountainous regions where optical data is often contaminated by clouds during rapeseed growing stages."

 Hydraulic traits mediate trade-offs between growth and mortality in plants yet characterizing these traits at the community level remains challenging, particularly in the Amazon, where they vary widely across species and environments. While previous studies have used reflectance-based estimates, hydraulic traits, which arise from wood and/or whole-plant anatomy and physiology, have not been comprehensively explored.For the first time, we comprehensively investigated the use of leaf reflectance to predict hydraulic traits alongside leaf functional traits in tropical evergreen and deciduous trees. For 196 Amazonian trees, we measured water potential, leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf reflectance, hydraulic conductivity curves (e.g., P50), and wood density (WD). We examined the relationships between leaf reflectance and traits using partial least square regression (PLSR).Our findings indicate that leaf reflectance accurately predicts variation in LMA (R2 = 0.8), and reasonably estimates xylem water potential (R2 = 0.51) and WD (R2 = 0.52). However, P50 predictions were much less reliable (R2 = 0.27), with water absorption bands greatly influencing the PLSR model. Leaf phenological strategy had little impact on the results.These findings suggest that reflectance-based remote sensing could monitor water status and forest carbon dynamics through water potential and wood density, respectively. However, our case study applying the PLSR approach to hyperspectral canopy spectra to predict wood density revealed challenges to upscaling. Despite these limitations, remote sensing of forest hydraulic traits at scale could enhance our understanding of drought vulnerability and carbon dynamics in Amazonian forests, with significant implications for conservation."

 Accurate and timely mapping of rural settlements using medium-resolution satellite imagery, such as Landsat data, is crucial for evaluating rural infrastructure, estimating ecological service values, assessing the quality of life for rural populations, and promoting sustainable rural development. Current mapping techniques, including pixel-based and object-based classifications, primarily focus on identifying artificial surfaces, often failing to capture the complete spatial footprint of rural settlements. These settlements consist of diverse land cover elements, such as houses, roads, agricultural buildings, ponds, parks, and woodlands, which together form entities with distinct local characteristics. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel classification strategy: Entity-Based Image Analysis (EBIA). Inspired by cognitive principles of human visual perception, EBIA groups related land cover elements and differentiates settlements from their background. The key innovation of EBIA lies in its ability to incorporate semantic features within rural settlements, transforming pixel-level land cover classification results (Phase 1) into entity-level settlement mapping results (Phase 2). Our results demonstrate that EBIA effectively maps the comprehensive footprint of rural settlement entities, achieving F1 scores ranging from 0.79 to 0.88 across five globally selected experimental areas. Furthermore, EBIA can be utilized to monitor changes in rural settlements using long-term Landsat imagery. As a new classification strategy, EBIA holds potential for mapping other geographic entities."

 Canopy height mapping is critical for assessing forest structure, forest resilience, carbon stocks, habitat, and biodiversity, all of which are threatened by changing climate and weather extremes. While current tools utilizing lidar (e.g., GEDI) and multispectral imagery (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel-2, airborne imagery) produce canopy height products, significant challenges remain, particularly in capturing fine-scale spatial details across large areas with high frequency. PlanetScope CubeSat imagery, with its 3 m spatial resolution and near-daily frequency, offers a unique opportunity to estimate woody plant structure by capturing fine-scale texture and temporal patterns that shift throughout the year. In this study, we adapted a 3D Spatio-Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (ST-CNN) to estimate canopy height at 3 m resolution, utilizing sequential PlanetScope time series over five months, summer Sentinel-1 radar imagery, and solar illumination layers as inputs. We generated a large and diverse reference database covering 2,296 sample scenes (each scene = 768 × 768 m, totaling ∼135,000 ha) using a semi-automatic labeling process that leverages 23 aerial lidar surveys conducted in California between 2016 and 2021. Trained on a random selection of 2,046 scenes, the accuracy assessment on the remaining 250 scenes demonstrates strong performance across various ecoregions, capturing 80.8% of the observed variance in live canopy height with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.6 m and a bias of -0.53 m compared with aerial lidar. Analysis of all 681 GEDI footprints over the same testing scenes estimates the MAE of 6.5 m, bias of -1.82 m, and R2 of 0.58 for the GEDI L2A Vector Canopy Top Height RH98 product. The ST-CNN model accurately identifies heterogeneous canopy structures, and shows sensitivity to canopies reaching 50 to 60 m in height. We found a major contribution from the PlanetScope time series, compared to a single PlanetScope image, and marginal benefits of including Sentinel-1 and terrain-based solar irradiance layers to improve performance on dense canopies or diverse topography. Example applications demonstrate the ability to generalize to different years, maintaining consistent predictions between years and capturing changes in canopy height over a seven year period (2017–2023) within 400 plots representing regrowth, minimal change, selective logging, and clear cut areas. We also demonstrate improved canopy height estimation compared to existing products from Landsat (MAE = 8.41 m) and Sentinel-2 (MAE = 7.19 m). A visualization tool displays our data alongside existing products for the Sierra Nevada in 2022. The Planet ST-CNN model, using a 15-day PlanetScope satellite time series, offers a scalable approach for annual canopy height estimation in California, achieving a high level of detail, often down to the resolution of individual trees. This improved capability of forest structure monitoring is expected to deliver crucial, comprehensive data for assessing and tracking forest carbon, biodiversity, and vulnerability, ultimately facilitating data-driven strategies to improve forest resilience."

 Space geodetic techniques have achieved centimeter to even millimeter precision in measuring earth surface deformation. However, a large data gap remains in the offshore area. Offshore man-made structures (e.g., oil/gas platforms) anchored to the ocean bottom provide an opportunity to study seafloor motion in some areas. Although satellite InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) has been widely used to study earth surface deformation, its application to offshore regions is extremely limited. Continuous GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) observations at several tens of offshore platforms in the Adriatic Sea have recently been released. Measuring the same platforms with InSAR provides a great opportunity to assess the feasibility of applying this technique to study seafloor motion on a regional scale using offshore structures. We processed a six-year-long time series of SAR images from the Sentinel-1A satellite using the Permanent Scatterer InSAR (PS-InSAR) method. We assessed the feasibility of phase unwrapping using synthetic data with different velocity fields and noise levels. Correct phase unwrapping could be achieved in the Adriatic Sea and two other large offshore oil/gas fields: the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea. Different calibration strategies were applied, and we suggest that the InSAR results could be calibrated with limited and even no GNSS stations. Our InSAR results show good agreement with the GNSS measurements and the InSAR observations from the European Ground Motion Service. In addition, our InSAR results provide deformation measurements at about twenty offshore structures where GNSS stations are not present. Most of the offshore structures have a subsidence rate of no more than 5 mm/year, while a few of them reach about 10 mm/year. Our work demonstrates that it is feasible to apply the InSAR technique to measure displacement of discrete offshore man-made structures (fixed to the ocean bottom) on a regional scale but still on a case-by-case basis. Pre-acquired information including geological settings, existing geodetic observations, and human activity records (e.g., hydrocarbon production) are useful information to assess the feasibility and to validate the InSAR results."

 Most existing soil moisture (SM) products from earth observations and land surface models over the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) have coarse resolutions or are mostly generated with high spatial resolutions based on downscaling methods. The former could hinder the applications in hydrological and ecological analyses at the regional scale and the performance of the latter could be limited by the intricate relationship between SM and downscaling factors in regions with complex topography. To address this issue, this paper aims to retrieve a 1 km SM product from 2017 to 2021 using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations based on a semi-empirical method specific to the QTP region (SMS-1) as different from the previous downscaled SM products. The main interest in our retrievals is that the semi-empirical modeling approach allows exploring the relationships between microwave backscatters and the soil and vegetation parameters spatially based on well-defined mathematics. The SMS-1 retrievals were evaluated against the observations from five in-situ networks over the QTP and against six other existing downscaled 1 km SM products. The temporal evaluation against in-situ measurements showed that SMS-1 retrievals performed better than most 1 km SM products obtained from Machine Learning methods (median R = 0.57, ubRMSD = 0.064 m3/m3, RMSD = −0.107 m3/m3 and bias = −0.042 m3/m3) except for SMSg. Furthermore, the SMS-1 retrievals presented reasonable spatial patterns that are consistent with the spatial distribution of the grassland-type map. Our Sentinel-1 SAR-based method can therefore potentially serve as a foundation for the advance of active microwave remote sensing SM algorithm to retrieve spatially high-resolution SM."

 NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamic Investigation (GEDI) mission provides billions of lidar samples of canopy structure over the Earth's temperate and pantropical forests. Using the GEDI sample data alone, gridded height and biomass products have been created at a spatial resolution of 1 km or coarser. However, this resolution may be too coarse for some applications. In this study, we present a new method of mapping high spatial resolution forest height across large areas using fusion of data acquired by GEDI and TanDEM-X (TDX) Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR). Our method utilizes GEDI waveforms to provide vertical profiles of scatterers needed to invert a physically-based InSAR model to solve for canopy height. We then use 2-year GEDI canopy height and adaptive wavenumber (kZ)-based calibration models to reduce errors in the inverted canopy height caused by the limited penetration capability of the X-band signal in dense tropical forests and the impact of terrain. We apply this novel method over large areas including Gabon, Mexico, French Guiana and most of the Amazon basin, and generate continuous forest height products at 25 m and 100 m. After validating against airborne lidar data, we find that our canopy height products have a bias of 0.31 m and 0.46 m, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 8.48 m (30.02 %) and 6.91 m (24.08 %) at 25 m and 100 m respectively, for all sites combined. Compared to existing data products that integrate GEDI with passive optical data using machine learning approaches, our method reduces bias, has a lower RMSE, and does not saturate for tall canopy heights up to 56 m. A key feature of this study is that our canopy height product is complemented with an uncertainty of prediction map which provides information on the predictor's uncertainty around the actual value —an advancement over the standard error maps used in earlier studies, which provide uncertainty around the expectation of the predicted value. This integration approach enables the first-ever accurate and high-resolution mapping of forest canopy heights at unprecedented large areas from GEDI and TDX InSAR data fusion, serving as an essential foundation for pantropical aboveground biomass mapping."

 High-quality and continuous satellite data are essential for land surface studies such as monitoring of land surface phenology, but factors such as cloud contamination and sensor malfunction degrade the quality of remote sensing images and limit their utilization. Filling gaps and recovering missing information in time series of remote sensing images are vital for a wide range of downstream applications, such as land surface phenology extraction. Most existing gap-filling and cloud removal methods focus on individual or multi-temporal image reconstruction, but struggle with continuous and overlapping missing areas in time series data. In this study, we propose a Temporal Attention-Based Multi-Scale Generative Adversarial Network (TAMGAN) to reconstruct time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. TAMGAN leverages a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with a 3-dimensional Convolution Neural Networks (3DCNN) in its generator to reconstruct the missing areas in the annual time series of remote sensing images simultaneously. The temporal attention blocks are designed to capture the changing trends of surface reflectance over time. And multi-scale feature extraction and progressive concatenation are introduced to enhance spectral consistency and provide detailed texture information. Experiments are carried out on MOD09A1 products to evaluate the performance of the proposed network. The results show that TAMGAN outperformed the comparison methods across various evaluation metrics, particularly in handling large and continuous missing areas in the time series. Furthermore, we showcase an example of downstream application by extracting phenological information from the gap-filled products. By effectively filling gaps and removing clouds, our method offers spatial-temporal continuous MODIS surface reflectance data, benefiting downstream applications such as phenology extraction and highlighting the potential of artificial intelligence technique in remote sense data processing."

 This study introduces an Entropy-based index: the Lorenz-entropy (LE) index, which we have developed by integrating Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR), econometrics, and forest ecology. The main goal of the LE is to bridge the gap between theoretical entropy concepts and their practical applications in monitoring vertical structural complexity of tropical forest ecosystems. The LE index quantifies entropy by analyzing Relative Height (RH) metrics (representing a one-dimensional (1D) canopy structure metric) distributions from full-waveform LiDAR across successional stages in a tropical dry forest (TDF) and a tropical rainforest. To validate the LE trends derived from LiDAR, we extended the analysis using inventory-based two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) metrics, specifically basal area and biomass. The consistency of trends between the 1D LiDAR-derived LE and the inventory-based 2D and 3D metrics reinforces the LE's ability to capture and monitor structural complexity reliably across different measurement dimensions.Our findings demonstrated that LE captures the changes in entropy as a function of successional stages, reflecting how canopy structure evolves towards homogeneity and complexity. Our statistical analysis revealed significant differences between successional stages (ANOVA, α = 0.05, p < 2e-16), with LE increasing substantially from early to late stages and plateauing at climax, where vertical structure (entropy) stabilizes. The mean LE increased by 1.70×10−2 between late and climax stages, with a small effect size (Cohen's d = 0.25), indicating minor differences in complexity. The LE index, calculated from biomass and basal area, confirming that as forests mature, entropy and vertical structural complexity increase. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis showed that LE is most responsive to RHs variability during intermediate stages, suggesting that structural development is most dynamic during this phase. These results demonstrate the potential of the LE index as a tool for ecological analysis and monitoring forest dynamics."

 Global Positioning System (GPS) instruments capture the daily crustal 3D deformation responding elastically to terrestrial water storage (TWS) variations, providing a powerful tool for hydrological studies. Here, we further expand the application of GPS in flood potential assessment. GPS vertical and horizontal crustal deformation are inverted into TWS variations using a 3D-Inversion model, and then a novel GPS-based modified flood potential index (GMFPI) is developed to assess and attribute the spatiotemporal patterns of flood potential in Brazil. The 3D-Inversion-derived TWS estimates show more spatial details compared to those derived from vertical deformation (1D-Inversion), with annual water thickness amplitudes of about 900 mm in the middle Amazon River, which is consistent with the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Mascon solutions but is greater than the 1D-Inversion estimates. The comparison between in-situ discharge data and GMFPI indicates that GMFPI performs well in monitoring flood potential, showing Accuracy (ACC) values greater than 0.8 at basin scales. In four reported flood events, the spatial patterns of GMFPI and discharge show that the locations of those floods are accurately characterized by GMFPI. The attribution analysis of flood dynamics shows that precipitation in coastal regions can rapidly increase flood potential, while a large amount of precipitation in inland regions first replenishes unsaturated soil water and groundwater. Additionally, the daily GMFPI exhibits good consistency with daily discharge, demonstrating a capacity for monitoring floods at a sub-monthly scale. Our study highlights the improvement of 3D-Inversion to TWS estimates and the novel application of GPS in flood potential assessing with high spatiotemporal resolution, providing valuable insights for flood early warning and prevention."

Bailey,"A text-based, generative deep learning model for soil reflectance spectrum simulation in the solar range (400–2499 nm)","•A fully data driven SOGM for simulation of soil reflectance spectra was developed. •The inputs of SOGM are text-based information describing soil properties. •The model was trained on an extensive dataset comprising nearly 180,000 spectra. •SOGM can simulate output spectra based on an incomplete set of input properties. 
 Soil spectral reflectance is a necessary input for land surface and radiative transfer models, and can be used to infer soil properties. Numerous soil reflectance inversion models have been developed based on mechanistic approaches, each with their own limitations. Mechanistic models based on radiative transfer theory are usually based on only a few input soil properties, whereas data-driven approaches are limited by high non-uniformity of available published datasets that severely limits the amount of data usable for model calibration. To address these limitations, a fully data-driven soil optics generative model (SOGM) for simulation of soil reflectance spectra from soil property inputs was developed based on the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). The model was trained on an extensive dataset comprising nearly 180,000 soil spectra-property set pairs from 17 published datasets. The model generates soil reflectance spectra from text-based inputs describing soil properties and their values rather than only numerical values and labels in binary vector format, which means the model can handle variable formats for property reporting. Because the model is generative, it can simulate reasonable output spectra based on an incomplete set of available input properties, which becomes more reliable as the input property set becomes more complete. Two additional sub-models were also built to complement the SOGM: a spectral padding model that can fill in the gaps for spectra shorter than the target solar range (400 to 2499 nm), and a wet soil spectra model that can estimate the effects of water content on soil reflectance spectra given the dry spectrum predicted by the SOGM. It can also be easily integrated with other soil–plant radiation models used for remote sensing research such as PROSAIL and Helios 3D plant modeling software. The testing results of the SOGM on new datasets not included in model training demonstrated that the model can generate reasonable soil reflectance spectra based on available property inputs.

 Accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) is essential for the precise quantification of energy and water budgets under climate change. Remote sensing ET models provide an effective way to map ET across different spatial and temporal scales. However, conductance-based ET models such as PML_V2 are associated with limited or no water stress constraints on soil evaporation and canopy transpiration that could cause significant bias for sparse vegetation in arid and semi-arid areas. To meet this challenge for using conductance-based ET models, we proposed to use shortwave infrared information to serve as a water stress constraint to vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation, and an improved ET model (PML_SWIR) was proposed. The PML_SWIR model was calibrated with ET measurements from 21 eddy covariance flux towers distributed across China, and showed good performance for estimating ET (R2 = 0.70 and RMSE = 0.72 mm/day) for the cross-validation dataset. PML_SWIR outperformed PML_V2 in estimating ET for arid and semi-arid areas, indicated by RMSE being 7.86 and 25.93 mm/year lower and bias being 4.74 and 16.63 % less compared with PML_V2(China) and PML_V2(Global) for ET estimation over Xinjiang Province. In addition, PML_SWIR was noticeably better than PML_V2 for depicting the ET patterns for these seasonal rivers in the arid areas. The ET values estimated by PML_SWIR were further compared with other ET products. The results indicated that PML_SWIR well characterized the ET pattern in arid and semi-arid areas, and the estimated ET values showed good agreement with the water balance-based ET (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 91.37 mm/year) in major river basins of China. The PML_SWIR ET estimates indicated that 20.2 % of the area of China increased significantly in ET over the study period, mainly due to vegetation greening caused by cropland expansion and the large-scale afforestation program. Overall, our results demonstrated that the incorporation of SWIR-based water stress constraints into the conductance-based ET model was a very promising way for accurately mapping ET in arid and semi-arid areas, and that the PML_SWIR model was highly applicable to regional high spatiotemporal ET mapping."

 Understanding the optical properties of dorsiventral leaves and quantifying leaf biochemical traits through physical models are important for interpreting canopy radiative transfer and monitoring plant growth. Previous models, such as the dorsiventral leaf model (DLM), have effectively accounted for the inner asymmetry of the leaf but neglected the asymmetry of surface structures between the upper and lower epidermis. In this study, we found marked differences in bidirectional reflectance factors (BRF) between the adaxial and abaxial surfaces of leaves under multi-angular measurements due to surface structural distinctions. To address this asymmetry in both internal and surface leaf structures, we subsequently proposed an advanced DLM model (MADLM) for simulating both multi-angular and spectral BRF of two leaf sides, linking the angular reflection of leaf adaxial and abaxial sides to surface structural parameters (roughness and refractive index) based on microfacet theory. Results show that MADLM accurately simulates multi-angular and spectral BRF for both sides of dorsiventral leaves, and yields satisfactory retrieval accuracy of leaf traits from all observation geometries. For close-range hyperspectral imaging applications, we further introduced a simplified version, sMADLM, which characterizes the surface reflection of two leaf sides in terms of the product of a leaf-side dependent parameter and the wavelength-dependent Fresnel factor. The sMADLM improves the mapping accuracy of leaf biochemical traits by effectively reducing the surface reflection effects in dorsiventral leaves. The MADLM and sMADLM deepen our understanding of the optical properties of dorsiventral leaves and provide practical methods for retrieving leaf biochemical traits via optical remote sensing."

Atkinson,Unsupervised object-based spectral unmixing for subpixel mapping,"•An unsupervised object-based subpixel mapping (UO-SPM) model was proposed. •Object-based analysis was used to enhance spectral unmixing and subpixel mapping. •Various SPM methods are enhanced effectively within the UO-SPM framework. •UO-SPM consistently produces more accurate results across various study sites. 
 Subpixel mapping (SPM) addresses the widespread mixed pixel problem in remote sensing images by predicting the spatial distribution of land cover within mixed pixels. However, conventional pixel-based spectral unmixing, a key pre-processing step for SPM, neglects valuable spatial contextual information and struggles with spectral variability, ultimately undermining SPM accuracy. Additionally, while extensively utilized, supervised spectral unmixing is labor-intensive and user-unfriendly. To address these issues, this paper proposes a fully automatic, unsupervised object-based SPM (UO-SPM) model that exploits object-scale information to reduce spectral unmixing errors and subsequently enhance SPM. Given that mixed pixels are typically located at the edges of objects (i.e., the inner part of objects is characterized by pure pixels), segmentation and morphological erosion are employed to identify pure pixels within objects and mixed pixels at the edges. More accurate endmembers are extracted from the identified pure pixels for the secondary spectral unmixing of the remaining mixed pixels. Experimental results on 10 study sites demonstrate that the proposed unsupervised object (UO)-based analysis is an effective model for enhancing both spectral unmixing and SPM. Specifically, the spectral unmixing results of UO show an average increase of 3.65 % and 1.09 % in correlation coefficient (R) compared to Fuzzy-C means (FCM) and linear spectral mixture model (LSMM)-derived coarse proportions, respectively. Moreover, the UO-derived results of four SPM methods (i.e., Hopfield neural network (HNN), Markov random field (MRF), pixel swapping (PSA) and radial basis function interpolation (RBF)) exhibit an average increase of 5.89 % and 3.04 % in overall accuracy (OA) across the four SPM methods and 10 study sites compared to the FCM and LSMM-based results, respectively. Moreover, the proportions of both mixed and pure pixels are more accurately predicted. The advantage of UO-SPM is more evident when the size of land cover objects is larger, benefiting from more accurate identification of objects."

 Volcanoes are dynamic systems whose surfaces constantly evolve. During volcanic eruptions, which can pose great threat to local communities, significant changes to the local topography occur as edifices build up and/or collapse and lava, tephra and other eruptive products are deposited. Monitoring such changes in topography is crucial to risk assessment and the prediction of further eruptive behaviour. Multistatic Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a remote sensing modality particularly suited to this task as it allows for the creation of digital elevation models (DEMs) that can accurately map out three-dimensional changes in the topography, regardless of weather conditions and temporal decorrelation caused by volcanic activity. Few such missions are however currently operational. Harmony is an upcoming ESA mission that will be operating alongside Sentinel-1 and will provide multistatic InSAR capabilities for the measurement of stress and deformation across the cryosphere, the oceans and the solid earth, with the monitoring of topographic change due to volcanic eruptions being one of the specific areas of focus for the mission.In this work we demonstrate the use of high resolution bistatic interferometric data from TanDEM-X for the measurement of topographic change after recent eruptions in El Reventador, Ecuador and La Soufrière, St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Additionally, we simulate data at the lower, 20 m resolution of Harmony so as to gain insights into its capability in quantifying topographic change. Our results demonstrate that Harmony’s resolution can be sufficient to resolve and measure accurately topographic change such as the emplacement of lava flows, but may be challenged in areas of steep topography where unwrapping errors can occur. The experimental results highlight the effect of acquisition pass direction with respect to local topography, the challenges arising in areas of steep topography and the importance of masking results based on estimates of precision and resolution. Finally we discuss some of the challenges, as well as implications of the Harmony mission for the future of volcano monitoring."

 Using remote sensing to measure suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in mountainous rivers can compensate for the scarcity of in situ sediment observations, providing valuable direct supplementation to observational records. However, for inland rivers, remote sensing SSC assessments face challenges such as data quality, long-term water body changes, environmental noise, flood events, and the transferability of local calibrations. Here, we introduce and apply remote sensing big data techniques using 12,445 cloud-free Landsat 5, 7, and 8 satellite images to calibrate SSC in the source region of the Yangtze River (SRYR). Utilizing Google Earth Engine, we implemented a series of image preprocessing techniques and water fraction methods to extract precise inland river water masks. Then we used unsupervised K-Means clustering and machine learning algorithms to model the relationship between water optical properties and SSC. By integrating these methodologies, we achieved an average relative calibration error of 0.26 for each optical cluster, and an average relative station deviation of 0.24 based on in situ measurements, minimizing SSC calibration to acceptable levels. Additionally, our results reveal that geomorphic patterns significantly influence sediment yield and transport by regulating sediment sources and sinks, fluvial morphology, and water-sediment connectivity. Over the past two decades, approximately 35.73 % of the sediment relative to the basin outlet discharge in the SRYR has been temporarily stored or confined within sediment sinks.

 Extending satellite radar altimetry measurements from the open ocean to the coastal zone can improve the accuracy and quality of monitoring coastal sea level. However, radar altimetry waveforms can be distorted by any inhomogeneity in the properties of the surface observed within the footprints, possibly leading to range measurement errors. To address these issues, a coastal retracking method based on reconstructed sea surface height and iterative threshold (RSIT) is proposed in this paper. RSIT involves several steps: First, the sea surface height components are reconstructed as prior information to compute the initial retracking gate. Next, iterate the amplitude scale factor of the entire waveform to identify possible sub-waveforms. After each iteration, continuity between neighboring sub-waveforms is assessed. Eventually, the optimal retracking gate is determined from all identified sub-waveforms. We validated RSIT using Jason-2 data in the coastal regions of Australia and Pakistan. Experimental results show that RSIT can retrieve more available altimetry data and enhance the accuracy by nearly 37.5% and 23.1% compared to ALES within the last few kilometers to the coast, respectively.

 The pre-processing feasibility assessment of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is important for predicting the quality of InSAR results and guiding the further accurate slope displacement monitoring. However, such kinds of pre-processing (i.e. before the interferometry data processing) assessment method are few, especially for the slope displacement in wide areas. In this article, a method for assessing the pre-processing feasibility of InSAR displacement monitoring is proposed, which mainly takes into accounts the maximum detectable deformation gradients (MDDG), SAR geometric distortions and vegetation coverage. Based on the above factors, the classification criteria employed for InSAR feasibility assessment are built. The approach is applied over Guangxi Province, China a landslide prone area, and an InSAR feasibility map categorized into four categories: high, moderate, low, and very low over the entire study area for pre-processing analysis is obtained. The feasibility results indicate that approximately 77% of areas are classified as very low in the four categories, while the high and moderate feasibility are mainly distributed in urban areas and regions with a NDVI value of less than 0.5. The feasibility results show great agreement with the time series InSAR monitoring results derived from the real Sentinel-1 data in the further validation.

 Remote Sensing Image (RSI) scene classification plays a pivotal role in diverse applications such as land cover mapping, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. Traditional deep learning approaches, however, heavily rely on abundant labeled data, which is often costly and challenging to acquire. Semi-supervised learning emerges as a cost-effective alternative, yet existing methods frequently overlook the intricate characteristics of remote sensing data, such as multi-scale features and complex spatial patterns, thereby limiting their ability to effectively address these challenges. In this study, a novel Scene Semi-Supervised Method (SSSM) is introduced, marking a significant advancement in both network architecture and semi-supervised techniques. At the core of the SSSM framework lies the Multi-Level Feature Fusion Network (MFFN), meticulously designed to extract and integrate complex features from remote sensing data across diverse scales and locations. To optimize the utilization of pseudo-labels and minimize mislabeling, the Pseudo-Label Multi-Level Sampling strategy (PMLS) is proposed, a probabilistic approach that selectively identifies high-quality pseudo-labels to enhance training. Rigorous experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets reveal that the SSSM method significantly improves classification accuracy, achieving an increase of 3%–5% on a specific dataset compared to existing approaches. This accomplishment underscores the effectiveness of the MFFN design and the semi-supervised strategy in tackling the complexities of remote sensing scene classification.

 Accurate identification and classification of tree species on a large scale are crucial for the effective management of urban green spaces; however, previous research combining airborne sensors such as LiDAR and hyperspectral imaging for tree classification has generally focused on smaller areas or specific sites, with limited studies applying this approach at the city-wide scale. This study focuses on the utilization of multi-temporal airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data for the classification of 10 species of urban trees at the city scale, which collectively cover over 95 % of the tree-covered areas within the city. Our objective is to evaluate the utility of metrics and indices derived from LiDAR (leaf-on/leaf-off) and HSI (peak growing season/autumn senescence) data in a 35.86 km2 urban green space in Gwacheon, Republic of Korea. A comprehensive set of 15 independent variables was extracted from preprocessed and calibrated airborne LiDAR data (footprint size: 0.46 m, density: 42.7 points/m2) and HSI data (127 bands, 400–970 nm range, spatial resolution: 0.68 m) to train seven machine learning classifiers. The model was trained on a stratified random sample of 21,826 tree crown polygon samples collected from individual trees surveyed. The results showed that the combination of airborne LiDAR and HSI data from two seasons achieved the highest classification accuracy with the light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) classifier (90.6 %; Kappa: 0.895) for all 10 major tree species across the entire city, especially for Ginkgo, American sycamore, and Yoshino cherry. Among all variables, the maximum tree height (Hmax) and the intersection symmetric difference ratio index (ISDRI) were among the top influential factors for tree species classification accuracy. Hmax, with an importance value of 0.490, is particularly effective due to the characteristics of urban green spaces. ISDRI, with an importance value of 0.336, highlights seasonal leaf volume differences, aiding in species differentiation. The spectral indices acquired during the autumn leaf senescence showed a cumulative shapley additive explanations (SHAP) importance score that was 0.374 points higher than that of the leaf-on period, highlighting the enhanced significance of hyperspectral data from the leaf senescence phase in classifying tree species. The synergistic integration of airborne LiDAR, HSI, and seasonal data gathered during key phenological periods, along with relevant indices, will contribute significantly to urban forest management at the city-wide level."

 Sea level changes will significantly drive hydrodynamic, morphological, and ecological development of estuaries. However, the interplay of geomorphology and vegetation at estuary scales remains unclear. To better understand this process, we take the Western Scheldt estuary in the Netherlands as an example to reveal the link between changes in emersion duration and vegetation dynamics in the period 1993–2016. We found that tidal flats in the Western Scheldt become steeper—higher intertidal areas increased in elevation and emersion duration, whereas the low-lying edges of tidal flats experienced a decrease in elevation and emersion duration. We found that longer emersion duration was associated with increased plant diversity and cover. Furthermore, we detected the unique spatiotemporal response patterns of four abundant plant species to geomorphological variations. Our study suggests that on a large estuary scale, geomorphological changes are coupled to the richness and cover of plant communities, and that potential changes in relative sea level can induce structural modifications of the plant communities. It also emphasizes the importance of assessing the potential effects of localized relative sea level changes while considering all aspects of natural processes and direct and indirect human influences.

 Many invasive shrubs in the eastern deciduous forests of the United States use the temporal niche before and after the native tree canopy leaf-on period (leafing out prior to most native species and retaining leaves after most natives senesce) to establish in the light-limited environment of the understory. To support an increased understanding of invasive shrub species’ ecology and distribution patterns and inform better management plans, this key phenological difference needs to be characterized in detail. Here we leveraged the high-resolution observations from the French-Israel VENµS mission to examine the phenological characteristics of a widespread invasive shrub species—Amur honeysuckle (AH; Lonicera maackii (Rupr.) Herder)—compared to native deciduous trees in Robinson Forest, Kentucky. VENµS offered daily superspectral (12 narrow bands) observations at 4 m resolution in a limited number of global sites, providing us with crucial data for the analysis. We identified three forest communities with respect to AH presence through field surveys (i.e., uninvaded forest stands, forest stands with AH understory, and AH shrub thickets) and compared their VENµS-derived spectral signatures and time series of vegetation indices. In 2023, AH shrub thickets greened up one month earlier than uninvaded forest stands (mid-March vs. mid-April). AH leaf growth advanced into full green before the canopy tree greenup started in early April, marking an optimal window for isolating areas with AH understory from the uninvaded forest using remote sensing. Based on the phenological differences identified, we predicted the distribution of AH in the study area using a two-date differencing model and a spectral mixture analysis. Our detailed findings using VENµS data offer insights into the temporal dynamics of invasive shrubs and native trees in a typical eastern deciduous forest. While our prediction of the AH distribution was confounded by the presence of native early greening and/or evergreen understory plants at a few locations, it was still moderately accurate (overall accuracy ∼ 70 %) and its abundance estimates agreed with observations in forest stands with minimal native understory growth. Moving forward, high-resolution remote sensing observations combined with a phenology-based approach will likely support more precise monitoring and management of invasive understory plants in native forest ecosystems."

 Compound hazards caused by tropical cyclones involve interactions among multiple hazards, such as wind, rainfall, and storm surge, significantly increasing the uncertainty and destructiveness of disasters. Existing studies primarily focus on probabilistic analyses of single or dual hazards associated with tropical cyclones, revealing limitations in handling high-dimensional data and complex dependencies. This study developed the ComHazAsTC-RRE (Compound Hazard Assessment of Tropical Cyclones within Repeatable, Reproducible, and Expandable Framework) model to analyze the compound hazards of wind, rainfall, and storm surge induced by tropical cyclones and successfully applied it to China’s coast. We collected globally accessible daily records of maximum wind speed, cumulative rainfall, and maximum storm surge for China’s coastal areas from 1979 to 2018. Using a C-Vine Copula with wind speed as the core, incorporating rainfall and storm surge as branches, we accurately captured complex dependencies of tropical cyclones. Our various return period analyses underscore the importance of considering multiple hazards and their interactions. Additionally, the application of Compound Hazard Index in China reveals that southeastern coastal areas are subjected to significantly higher compound hazards, driven by high wind speeds and strong spatial–temporal consistency of hazards. An in-depth analysis of failure probabilities indicates that neglecting the interactions among hazards can result in substantial additional cost for engineering projects, especially during severe tropical cyclones. This study offers new perspectives and scientific tools for understanding and addressing compound hazards, formulating effective disaster prevention and mitigation strategies, and supporting the sustainable development of coastal regions worldwide."

 Mangroves, critical for ecological sustainability, are challenging to map accurately due to their fragmented nature and difficult accessibility. Existing datasets, often constrained to 10 m or above resolutions, could misrepresent fragmented mangrove regions and suffer from sampling biases, limiting their regional applicability. Furthermore, scale conversion’s spatial and statistical implications on mangrove mapping accuracy and area estimation remain largely unexplored. This study proposes a novel framework that leverages UHR (0.2 m) aerial photos and the DeepLabV3+ model for fine-scale mapping and systematically simulates and quantifies scale-induced effects. The resultant 20 cm-resolution mangrove map of Hong Kong achieved an overall accuracy (OA) of 92.1 %, with up to 53 % improvement compared to various existing datasets. It delineates complex boundaries in diverse coastal settings while preserving the structural integrity of fragmented patches. The total mangrove area in Hong Kong is estimated at ∼720 ha, with Deep Bay comprising 77.5 %. The scale effects analysis revealed pronounced sensitivity in fragmented habitats, where each 1 m increase in resolution could result in an average area underestimation of 5000 m2 and up to 25 % OA degradation when transitioning from 0.2 m to 30 m. Moreover, integrating patch geometry and scale responses indicated that 6 m is the optimal scale for monitoring. Beyond this, OA could sharply decline to below 82 % at the commonly used 10 m resolution and drop as low as 66 % at 30 m. These findings highlight the critical importance of fine-scale mapping using UHR images for effective mangrove conservation and management."

 Accurately predicting truck origin–destination (OD) flows is essential for optimizing logistics systems and promoting coordinated regional development. Existing methods typically assume a monotonic decrease in truck OD flows with increasing geospatial distance, which oversimplifies the complex non-monotonic distribution patterns observed in practice. Moreover, these methods overlook interregional socioeconomic distances and their interaction with geospatial distances, thereby limiting the prediction accuracy and reliability. This study introduces a gravity-inspired model that integrates both geospatial and socioeconomic distances (GSD-DG) to explicitly represent their combined influence on truck OD flows. Specifically, we 1) develop a geospatial distance relation graph using the Weibull function to model the complex spatial distribution patterns of truck OD flows with varying geospatial distances; 2) propose a gravity-inspired representation learning method based on graph attention mechanism to quantify the influence of socioeconomic distance on truck OD flows; and 3) construct a deep gravity model that integrates these distances and their interactions to capture their non-linear relationship with truck OD flows. Extensive experiments on four datasets with varying spatial scale and economic development levels demonstrate that the GSD-DG model improves the robustness and prediction accuracy across diverse spatial distribution patterns, reducing RMSE by 14.2%–85.8% and MSE by 23.5%–92.5% compared to the six baseline models. Incorporating socioeconomic distance and its interaction with geospatial distance further reduces RMSE by 8.5%–36.0%. Additionally, explainable artificial intelligence techniques highlight how these distances affect truck OD flows, providing valuable policy insights for logistics planning and coordinated regional development."

 The indoor map is an indispensable component to visualize human users’ real-time locations and guided routes to find their destinations in large and complex buildings efficiently. The map design in existing mobile indoor navigation systems mostly considers either the user locations or the route segments but seldom considers the adaptation of the base map scale. Due to uneven densities of spatial elements, the complexity of routes, and the diversity of spatial distribution of navigation decision points, the base map information of indoor navigation maps varies greatly. Hence, it is inevitable to cause an inappropriate amount of map information at different locations and routes. Additionally, existing multi-scale representations of indoor maps are limited to certain scales but not adapted to building locations. Users have to adjust the map scales frequently through multiple interactions with the navigation system. In this study, we propose a method that considers the dynamic elements of indoor maps to quantify the map information for scale adaptation. The indoor navigation map information calculation includes both geometry information and spatial distribution information of static base map elements (area elements, POIs) and dynamic route elements (segments, decision points). The total map information is quantified by setting the weights of the two types of elements. An empirical study on indoor navigation map selection was conducted. Results show that the quantified map information using the proposed method can reflect a user-desired map better than the traditionally used scales."

 Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification based on deep learning has demonstrated promising performance. In general, using patch-wise samples helps to extract the spatial relationship between pixels and local contextual information. However, the presence of background or other category information in an image patch that is inconsistent with the central target category has a negative effect on classification. To solve this issue, a patch confidence-enhanced transformer (PCET) approach for HSI classification is proposed. To be specific, we design a patch quality assessment (PQA) branch model to evaluate the input patches during training process, which effectively filters out the intrusive non-central pixels. The output confidence of the branch model serves as a quantitative indicator of the contribution degree of the input patch to the overall training efficacy, which is subsequently weighted in the loss function, thereby endowing the model with the capability to dynamically adjust its learning focus based on the qualitative of the inputs. Second, a spectral–spatial multi-feature fusion (SSMF) module is devised to procure scores of representative information simultaneously and fully exploit the potential of multi-scale feature HSI data. Finally, to enhance feature discrimination, global context is efficiently modeled using the efficient additive attention transformer (EA2T) module, which streamlines the attention process and allows the model to learn efficient and robust global representations for accurate classification of the central pixel. A series of experimental results executed on real HSI datasets have substantiated that the proposed PCET can achieve outstanding performance, even when only 10 samples per category are used for training."

Based on eddy-covariance measurements from 65 sites, the vegetation index (VI)-driven GPP models (six different algorithms) are calibrated and validated. Our findings highlight that the Michaelis–Menten algorithm has the best performance and PPI is superior to the other five VIs, including NDVI, NIRv, EVI-2, NDPI, and NDGI, at predicting gross primary productivity (GPP) rates on a weekly scale (with an average R2 of 0.64 and RMSE of 1.70 g C m−2 d−1), regardless of short-term environmental constraints on photosynthesis.

 Glacial lakes (GLs), which serve as natural reservoirs, are also prospective sources of risk, and their risk levels are continuously increasing as a result of global climate warming. Nevertheless, GLs are situated in mountainous and valley regions, which are distinguished by their complex terrain and unpredictable weather conditions. This leads to restricted availability of optical imagery as a consequence of the frequent cloud cover. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), however, encounters issues with geometric distortion. This paper introduces an unsupervised method based on geometric distortion detection (without orbit state information) and historical positioning using dual-orbit SAR imagery to research GL extraction effectively. This method detects low-quality pixels from dual-orbit SAR imagery through geometric distortion. It extracts GLs using a majority voting integration of unsupervised classification algorithms constrained by historical GL center points. The Southeastern Tibetan Plateau (SETP) was chosen as a representative region for the study, and experiments were conducted from July to August 2018 using dual-orbit Sentinel-1 imagery. A total of 600 refined samples were used for comparative verification. The results demonstrate that this method is capable of reliably identifying the active and passive geometric distortions in SAR imagery. The fusion of dual-orbit SAR based on geometric distortion can effectively enhance the classification performance of remote sensing imagery and achieve the acquisition of GL water storage area during the flood season. The geometric distortion rate was reduced from 29.9% to 7.9% after fusion correction, and the accuracy, recall rate, precision, Intersection over Union (IoU), and F1-Score were 0.989, 0.900, 0.908, 0.825, and 0.904, respectively.

To tackle the challenge of ill-posed inversion, we leveraged the correlation coefficient matrix to mitigate erroneous combinations of free parameters in the construction of the lookup table. Results showcase that VIIRS-based LFMC inversion yields marginally superior accuracy (R2= 0.57, R2= 0.32) for both grassland and forest types, with VIIRS-based inversion demonstrating a lower relative root mean square error (rRMSE = 5.84%), compared to results from the MODIS. By scrutinizing LFMC trends alongside precipitation (PP) data in four forest fires spanning from 2019 to 2022 in southwest China, varied degrees of LFMC decrease preceding fire outbreaks. Those results substantiated the validity of the proposed method for wildfire warning.

 Rapid, accurate, and nondestructive estimation of grain number per panicle (GNPP) in winter wheat is crucial to accelerate smart breeding, improve precision crop management, and ensure food security. As two (panicle number per unit ground area and GNPP) of three commonly used yield components, GNPP was much less quantified with remotely sensed data than the former through visual counting. The limited research suffered from either low accuracies with ground canopy spectra or low efficiency with proximal panicle imaging systems. No studies have been reported on estimating GNPP with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery, underscoring its strong advantages in high-resolution and efficient monitoring. To address these issues, this study proposed a practical approach for estimating GNPP in winter wheat by integrating UAV imagery and meteorological data with meta-learning ensemble regression. The potential contributions of different variables were examined for understanding the improvement in the spectral estimation of GNPP, including spectral indices (SIs), the optimal canopy height (CH) metric, and absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (APAR).The results demonstrated that CHP99 (CH at the 99th percentile in the region of interest) derived from red-green-blue (RGB) imagery exhibited the strongest correlation with measured plant height among all RGB- or multispectral (MS)-derived CH metrics. The incorporation of remotely sensed APAR and RGB-derived CHP99 improved the accuracy of GNPP estimation over using merely color indices or SIs. Among all feature combinations, Comb. #6 (SIs + APARMS + CHP99) yielded the highest overall accuracies in estimating GNPP for individual and multiple stages.

The accumulation of massive multi-modal, multi-angle, and multi-resolution remote sensing data have greatly enriched the CD data sources. Among them, high-resolution optical remote sensing images contain abundant spatial detail information, making it possible to interpret fine-grained scenes and greatly expand the application breadth and depth of CD. Generally, traditional optical remote sensing CD methods are cumbersome in steps and have a low level of automation. In contrast, artificial intelligence (AI) based CD methods possess powerful feature extraction and non-linear modeling capabilities, thereby gaining advantages that traditional methods cannot match. As a result, they have become the mainstream approaches in the field of CD. This review article systematically summarizes the datasets, theories, and methods of CD for optical remote sensing image.

 Satellite images have been adopted in recent years for identifying topographical features on the Earth’s surface. Researchers have also published reports on the use of satellite images to analyze shoreline changes or to verify shoreline change in numerical models. But reports that demonstrate the reverse process of using satellite images to estimate the incident waves to a beach are rare, particularly to a place where protective coastal structures exist. This paper describes a once-thriving coastal townsite with two fishing ports in Korea which has been transformed into a typical example that relies on protective structures with occasional artificial nourishment to maintain its shoreline stability in the past 20 years. Unlike many others, this study proposes a new methodology to estimate the deepwater wave heights based on the analysis of shoreline data extracted from satellite images over 5 years (2019–2023) for Wonpyeong-Chogok Beach, its median sediment grain sizes D50, and the known empirical relationship between sediment and waves. The entire shoreline of 2,860 m in length is divided into 39 transects, of which one-half of it is protected by submerged and emergent detached breakwaters, where shoreline has advanced, while the rest has eroded. From the standard deviation values calculated from the extracted shoreline location data, the influence of long-term trends was excluded, and the intrinsic standard deviation is obtained by applying sediment size information, and then the incident deep-water (average annual maximum) wave height of 4.363 m was estimated. Applying this methodology to the beach area where the coastal structure was placed, the wave transmission of the coastal structure was calculated 0.91 and 0.72 for LCSs and TT-DBWs, respectively, through the reduction ratio of the standard deviation. Finally, discussions are made on how the resolution of the Sentinel-2 satellite images in affecting the standard deviation and long-term trend results in the shoreline data."

 A wide variety of spatially explicit modeling algorithms has recently mushroomed in geoinformation research. These algorithms establish local models with data from spatially confined subsets, thereby offering a new impetus for addressing the issue of spatiotemporal non-stationarity. However, a significant challenge persists in literature that local models are primarily predicated on linear assumptions, limiting their capacity to capture the non-linear relationships prevalent in real-world geographical phenomena. This study remedies this gap through proposing a novel approach that integrates the bagging and stacking approaches of ensemble learning into the spatially explicit modeling framework. We specifically develop the SpatioTemporal Random Forest (STRF) and SpatioTemporal Stacking Tree (STST) algorithms1, which capture and interpret the non-linearity in the spatial and temporal context more effectively. Additionally, we introduce the ‘local importance score’ and ‘spatiotemporally accumulated local effects’ as novel interpretable metrics for visualizing and unraveling the dynamics of non-stationarity in spatial analyses.

 We investigate the problem of 3D point clouds semantic segmentation. Recently, a large amount of research work has focused on local feature aggregation. However, the foundational framework of semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds has been neglected, where the majority of current methods default to the U-Net framework. In this study, we present U-Next, a small but mighty framework designed specifically for point cloud semantic segmentation. The key innovation of this framework is to capture multi-scale hierarchical features. Specifically, we construct the U-Next by stacking multiple U-Net L1 sub-networks in a dense arrangement to diminish the semantic gap. Concurrently, it integrates feature maps across various scales to proficiently restore intricate fine-grained details. Additionally, a multi-level deep supervision mechanism is introduced for smoothing gradient propagation and facilitating network optimization. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmarks, including the indoor S3DIS dataset, the LiDAR-based outdoor Toronto3D dataset, and the urban-scale photogrammetry-based SensatUrban dataset, demonstrate the superiority of U-Next.

 Shallow water environmental information is crucial for the study of marine ecosystems and human activities. There have been numerous satellite remote sensing studies focused on this area. However, accurate information acquisition from remote sensing data remains difficult in this region due to the complexity of the environment and the coupling between benthic reflectance and water column scattering. In this study, we developed a method to retrieve the diffuse attenuation coefficient (Kd), seafloor classification, and bathymetric maps by combining satellite laser altimetry and optical remote sensing imagery in shallow water areas. Firstly, the relationships between remote sensing reflectance (Rrs), water depth, and Kd were established based on radiative transfer theory. This method allows for the retrieval of Kd in shallow water regions, overcoming the limitations present in previous studies. Secondly, we eliminated the water column attenuation and obtained the bottom reflectance index (BRI). The BRI allowed us to determine the bottom reflectance and classify the seafloor using the Gaussian mixture model clustering method. This approach can effectively reduce the error in bathymetric inversion caused by variations in bottom reflectance. Finally, we developed a neural network model for bathymetric inversion. The model inputs consist of Rrs data and spectral shape data containing physical constraint information, aiming to achieve a robust estimation performance. We conducted the study in two experimental areas (the Bimini Islands and the Yongle Atoll) and compared the results with validation data to evaluate the algorithm performance. The results indicated an agreement between the estimated Kd and the validation data (inferred Kd490 values of 0.062 m−1 and 0.058 m−1, compared to a validation data range of 0.055–0.087 m−1 and 0.059–0.070 m−1, respectively). In addition, the seafloor classification accuracy was 86.74 % for the Yongle Atoll area. Finally, the neural network model accurately predicted the bathymetry in the two regions. The accuracy of the bathymetric maps improved significantly with seafloor classification, as indicated by reductions in root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.12 m and 0.15 m, and in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) by 2.24 % and 5.87 %, respectively. Overall, the proposed method can be used to effectively decouple benthic and water column signals and accurately obtain Kd, bottom reflectance, and bathymetric information for shallow water environments, providing unprecedented information for assessing and monitoring ecosystems and facilitating further research."

 Domain adaptation is crucial for information integration of remote sensing systems, such as satellite constellations and space stations, to intelligently achieving full domain awareness. The conventional methods focus on aligning spatial features without fully considering the topological structure and semantic information in the scene, resulting in loss of useful information and suboptimal classification results. This situation becomes more severe and further complicated to deal with under the condition of few labels available in the source domain. To address the above problems, a spatial-topological-semantic alignment method called STSA is proposed to implement unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) with few source labels, fully exploring multiple types of information and their complementarity in remote sensing images (RSIs). The proposed method is applied to complete the classification task on a multi-modal cross-domain datasets with synthetic aperture radar (SAR), thermal infrared (TI), near infrared (NI), and short wavelength infrared (SW) images derived from Chinese Tiangong-2 manned spacecraft, as well as a Single modal cross-domain datasets with optical images. Compared with the state of the art UDA methods, even with only one labeled RSI in the source domain, the proposed methods still perform better and achieve satisfying accuracy.

 Building generalization is an essential task in generating multi-scale topographic maps. The progress of deep learning offers a new paradigm to overcome the coordination challenges faced by conventional building generalization algorithms. Some studies have confirmed the feasibility of several original semantic segmentation networks, such as U-Net and its variants and the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN), for building generalization in image maps. However, they suffer from critical deformation effects, especially for large and geometrically complex buildings. Since learning building generalization essentially means modeling the subtle transformation of building footprints across scales, we argue that the spatial awareness of a neural network, for instance, regarding building size and shape, is crucial to effective learning. Thus, we propose a spatially-aware generative adversarial network, SpaGAN. It takes a representative cGAN, pix2pix, as the backbone, and modifies two modules: In the U-Net-based generator, an atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module replaces the conventional convolutional module to extract multi-scale features of buildings of varying sizes and shapes; in the PatchGAN-based discriminator, a signed distance map (SDM) module is used to capture the fine-grained shape difference for discrimination. The proposed network was comprehensively evaluated with a synthetic and a real-world dataset. The results demonstrate that SpaGAN outperforms existing baseline models (U-Net, ResU-Net, pix2pix) for building generalization, particularly in the real-world dataset. The new model can achieve more reasonable aggregation, simplification, and squaring generalization operators."

 This study aimed to create a model to identify land suitable for growing sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea) and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) in the Okavango River basin of the Kavango East region of Namibia.

In addition, this study proposed an innovative approach through the integration of subjective and objective analytical methods, which are independent of one another. The subjective component of the analysis employed a Multi-Criteria Decision Making-Analytic Hierarchy Process (MCDM-AHP). On the other hand, the objective component used a data-driven multivariate approach supported by tree-based learning algorithms. Twenty-two variables were considered, encompassing climatic conditions, hydro-geomorphologic features, soil characteristics, vegetation patterns, and socio-economic factors. These variables played a crucial role to identify the most suitable areas for growing the selected leguminous crops. The MCDM-AHP method utilised expert evaluations to rank the importance of variables, identifying water sources, slope, and soil properties as key factors. A suitability mapping analysis revealed that 17.63% of the area was highly suitable and 62.77% moderately suitable, while 10% was less suitable and 9.59% unsuitable for growing these two legumes.

 Under the background of climate change and global warming, extreme drought events in China are becoming increasingly frequent. Drought is one of the primary natural causes of damage to China’s agriculture, economy, and environment, making timely, accurate, and high-resolution drought monitoring particularly crucial. The global standardized precipitation − evapotranspiration index database (SPEIbase) is a widely accepted and used global-scale drought monitoring product. However, limited by its spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees, it is difficult to describe the local spatio-temporal structure of drought. How to improve its spatial resolution while maintaining spatio-temporal consistency is one of the current research hotspots. Based on the response of vegetation growth status to drought, this paper proposes a simple and feasible SPEI prediction method, which improves the resolution of SPEIbase from 0.5 degrees to 1 km. Sixteen remote sensing inversion indices, reflectance and elevation data related to drought were selected from Google Earth Engine (GEE) as features. After preprocessing such as gridding and sample balancing, a random forest regression model was constructed to achieve high spatial resolution prediction of SPEI. SPEI with time scales of 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 months in July 2020, August 2019 and August 2018 in China was selected for experiments. The accuracy of 1 km resolution SPEI was evaluated through metrics such as root mean square error (RMSE), Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and determination coefficient (R2). At the same time, it was compared with the existing 1 km resolution SPEI dataset and the site-scale SPEI values. The results show that the method in this paper can obtain accurate prediction results more stably. The PCC and R2 of different months and multiple time scales are all higher than 0.9 and 0.8, and the RMSE is lower than 0.4, showing a good application prospect. Despite the good consistency between the Proposed SPEI and SPEIbase with the site-scale SPEI values, there is still significant room for improvement."

 The boreal forest surrounds the Arctic region and is the most extensive ecosystem on Earth; one-third of its soil is influenced by permafrost and accompanying wetlands. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology has been widely utilized to monitor ground surface deformation in Arctic tundra and alpine grassland permafrost environments; however, its application in boreal forest areas is limited due to dense canopy cover and severe interferometric decorrelation. This study investigates the application of C-band InSAR to ground surface deformation monitoring in a southern boreal forest environment at Genhe River watershed in the northern part of the Greater Khingan Mountains, Northeast China. The analysis revealed that freezing-season interferograms have higher interferometric qualities and are more suitable for deformation monitoring. An InSAR pair correction and stacking algorithm was developed for retrieving extensive freezing-season deformation which could maximize the use of low-quality InSAR pairs, and reduce the effects of the snow depth phase and atmospheric distortions. The retrieved multiannual freezing-season deformation ranged from –32.8 mm to 129.1 mm. The uplift regions clearly indicate the extent of low-lying wetlands, which are influenced by frost heave caused by freezing soil water. Additionally, the “subsidence” areas correspond to farmland and evergreen coniferous forest regions in the study area, where liquid water content is higher than in other land cover types, thus resulting in a longer optical path for the radar signal. This study presents the first systematic analysis of applying C-band InSAR to ground surface deformation monitoring in the southern boreal forest environment. The retrieved seasonal deformation and deformation processes have a high potential for identifying wetlands, differentiating between forest types, and providing valuable insights into the hydrothermal conditions and dynamics of the boreal ecosystem."

 Land use/land cover (LULC) is one of the most impactful global change phenomenon. As a result, considerable effort has been devoted to creating large-scale LULC products from remote sensing data, enabling the scientific community to use these products for a wide range of downstream applications. Unfortunately, uncertainty associated with these products is seldom quantified because most approaches are too computationally intensive. Furthermore, uncertainty maps developed for large regions might fail to perform adequately at the spatial scale in which they will be used and might need to be customized to suit the specific applications of end-users.In this study, we describe the class-conditional conformal statistics method, an approach that quantifies uncertainty more uniformly for each class but that requires more calibration data than the conventional conformal method. Using the class-conditional method, we show that it is possible to create customized local uncertainty maps using local calibration data without requiring remote sensing and modeling work and that these local uncertainty maps outperform uncertainty maps calibrated based on global data. We use empirical data from Brazil (i.e., Dynamic World LULC product and Mapbiomas validation data) to demonstrate this methodology. The analysis of these data reveals substantial heterogeneity in observations of the same LULC class between Brazilian states, an indication that national-level data are not representative of the focal state, thus explaining why uncertainty maps calibrated using focal state-level data outperform maps calibrated using national-level data. Importantly, we develop straight-forward approaches to determine the spatial extent over which calibration data are still representative of the area of interest, ensuring that these data can be used to reliably quantify uncertainty. We illustrate the class-conformal methodology by creating uncertainty maps for a selected number of sites in Brazil. Finally, we show how these uncertainty maps can yield valuable insights for LULC map producers.Our methodology paves the way for users to generate customized local uncertainty maps that are likely to be better than uncertainty maps calibrated based on global data while at the same time being more relevant for the specific applications of these users.

 Effectively leveraging landslide spatial location information is crucial for improving the accuracy of deep learning in predicting landslide susceptibility and exploring the impacts of predisposing factors. Current single deep learning models for landslide susceptibility assessment require enhancements in both prediction accuracy and robustness. Inclusion of non-interrelated positional information among samples leads to reduced prediction accuracy and challenges in quantifying landslide risk covariates.

Using a stacking method, a 1D convolutional neural network (1D-CNN), a recurrent neural network (RNN), and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network were combined to form the CRNN-LSTM ensemble model. Additionally, we constructed a deep learning geographically weighted regression (GW-DNN) model based on the deep learning principles and geographically weighted regression to quantify the impacts of landslide-predisposing factors.The experimental results show that the CRNN-LSTM model achieved AUC values of 0.977 and 0.961 on the training and validation sets, significantly outperforming the individual classifiers (AUC of 0.944 and 0.940 for the 1D-CNN model, 0.950 and 0.948 for the RNN model, and 0.956 and 0.952 for the LSTM model).

 Recently Guangzhou and Foshan in China are experiencing significant urbanization and economic development. However, the accelerated urbanization process has contributed significantly to urban land subsidence, causing huge economic losses and endangering safety of infrastructure. This intricate activities on urban surfaces can also lead to pseudo danger in interpreting InSAR-based urban surface deformation, resulting in hazard misidentification in two cities. In order to more accurately identify the hazard of urban surface deformation, we innovatively present a combination of InSAR technology with multi-temporal optical remote sensing data. It can also analyze the specific causes of urban deformation at SAR pixel level in two cities. The SBAS-InSAR method was adopted to obtain an urban subsidence map from 2017 to 2020 based on 110 Sentinel-1 SAR image scenes. To obtain an urban surface change map with a high accuracy, an improved SwiT-UNet++ model was applied based on multi optical Google Earth imagery. By a combined analysis of SAR and optical images, we discovered multiple irregular funnels with subsidence at different scales in both cities, that are mostly relatable to urban surface constructions such as foundation compression, building demolition, and the construction of public facilities. Furthermore, to identify detailed hazard around surface changes, the buffer analysis based on InSAR surface deformation and urban surface change maps was conducted. It revealed the surface deformation signals around certain urban surface change areas are more obvious and pose certain hazard. Finally additional high-risk areas are found in the two cities. By subtracting the optical surface change detection map from the InSAR-based urban subsidence map, the “pseudo danger” caused by urban activities in the interpretation of InSAR-based urban surface deformation is eliminated, enabling precise identification of actual land subsidence hazards. It is realized through a risk assessment experiment in the research area by adding factors of urbanization processes. By combining multiple sources of data and using advanced analytical techniques, we could identify the determining factors contributing to urban subsidence and the detailed hazards and thus, provide valuable information for future urban developments."

 Glacier velocity is one of the crucial parameters in the research of glacier dynamics. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR), as an active microwave sensor, represents a common method to monitor glacier velocity. However, the changes of glacier surface could cause the data missing of glacier velocity due to incoherence. To meet the demand for glacier velocity monitoring, this paper employs the SAR images of Sentinel-1 in long time series and optical images of Sentinel-2 to investigate the velocity of Petermann glacier in 2021. Firstly, the time series of glacier velocity in the whole year of 2021 is obtained by using SAR images. The glacier velocity extracted from the optical image pairs is used as the initial value of the large missing part of the glacier velocity field. Then the spatiotemporal glacier velocity matrix is constructed and empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis is carried out. Among them, the glacier velocity is reconstructed by the glacier velocity estimation method based on confidence, and the complete glacier velocity time series is obtained by iterating to minimize the error of the reconstructed glacier velocity. Finally, the obtained time series of Petermann Glacier velocity in 2021 were statistically analyzed. The statistical results quantified the seasonal differences of Petermann Glacier. In addition, the analysis results show that the temporal and spatial variations of Petermann Glacier velocity are affected by topography and temperature."

 Sunlit and shaded components are commonly present in both airborne and satellite remote sensing images. In vegetated ecosystems, shaded component often result from sunlight being obstructed by topographic relief or canopy structures, and shaded component may impact plant growth, leaf photosynthesis, and ultimately carbon sequestration. To accurately estimate the fractional cover of the shaded and sunlit components, including both green and non-green vegetation within vegetated ecosystems, a novel method called the quasi-Hue-Saturation-Lightness (quasi-HSL) method is proposed in this study. Inspired by the RGB to HSL conversion, this method utilizes near-infrared, green, and red bands to compute hue (and normalized hue), saturation, and lightness. Subsequently, two indices, namely Hue-Lightness Index (HLI) and Saturation-Lightness Index (SLI), are introduced to construct a triangular space for estimating the fractional cover of the three components. Through unmanned aerial vehicle field experiments conducted in two forested areas, the accuracy of fractional cover estimation for three components reaches an R2 value of 0.50–0.67. Furthermore, this fractional cover estimation approach can be extended to a four-component estimation, including sunlit green vegetation, sunlit non-green vegetation, shaded green vegetation, and shaded non-green vegetation. With this detailed fractional cover estimation in vegetated area, the fractional vegetation coverage can be retrieved. Cross-validated with the fractional vegetation coverage retrieved by NDVI, the accuracy reaches R2 = 0.92. The advantages of the proposed method are (1) estimating fractional cover of shaded component without blue band, which is easily impacted by atmospheric conditions and sensor performance, and (2) differentiating the sunlit green and non-green vegetation components in the vegetated ecosystem."

 We investigated the performance of mass transfer from cloud water to rainwater, commonly referred to as ‘autoconversion’, in cloud microphysical schemes within high-resolution numerical models, such as the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF). The proper choice of autoconversion rate in the numerical model is crucial for droplet growth and conversion rates to form precipitation. The liquid water content and cloud properties, varying from shallow to convective clouds, are highly sensitive to autoconversion rates, and their sensitivity is closely linked with model biases. A parcel-bin model guided by observations can provide significant insights for selecting a more suitable suite of autoconversion rates for the forecasting model. The parcel-bin model is important for the explicit representation of hydrometeors population and calculating microphysical process rates. We calculated drop size distribution, relative dispersion, diffusion growth rate coefficient, and autoconversion rates for two environmental conditions using a small-scale model based on in situ airborne measurement data from the Cloud-Aerosol Interaction and Precipitation Enhancement Experiment (CAIPEEX) over the Indian subcontinent. We evaluated four different (Kessler, KES; Liu-Daum, LD; Khairoutdinov-Kogan, KK; Lee-Baik, LB) autoconversion rates in the WRF model for simulating two thunderstorm events over India.

Fernandez;S. Kim;T. Robinson,Standard fog collector and dual FM-120 comparisons,"•Upwind (free-stream) and leeward fog droplet spectra measurements from standard fog collectors. •Measurements of multiple efficiencies of field-based fog collectors. •Impact of environmental variables on fog collector efficiencies assessed. •First fog droplet spectra as part of fog collection deployment in Northern Hemisphere. •Comparison of results with those of previous studies in Chile. 
 For the first time in the northern hemisphere, extended measurements of fog droplet sizes and numbers were measured both upstream from and on the leeward side of a standard fog collector (SFC) using FM-120 optical spectrometers. These measurements, coupled with the water recorded by the standard fog collectors and accompanying meteorological data, have yielded efficiency measurements for field-based fog collectors for the first time in the northern hemisphere and only for the third time ever that we are aware of. Of note, two of these efficiencies are the ‘collector efficiency’ and the ‘mesh efficiency’. The collector efficiency is the ratio between the water draining from the collector and the upstream liquid water content (LWC) flux. This value describes the efficiency of the fog collector in collecting fog LWC. Using multiple-regression analysis, the collector efficiency has a significantly positive relationship with the mean volume diameter (MVD) (p = 0.0019), is negatively related with upstream LWC (p = 0.0012) and positively related with leeward LWC given all other variables held constant. The adjusted R-square of this regression model is 0.431. If we account for the interaction between upstream LWC and leeward LWC, which is statistically significant (p = 0.0219) given all other variables held constant, the adjusted R-square increases to 0.538. This interaction indicates that the positive relationship between collector efficiency and leeward LWC is significantly positive especially when the upstream LWC is low, but the positive relationship becomes weaker when the upstream LWC is high.The mesh efficiency describes the efficiency of the mesh in removing the fog LWC and it was calculated to have an average value of 35 % ± 19 %. It is equal to the difference between the LWC arriving at the surface of the SFC and what is measured behind the mesh all divided by the LWC arriving at the surface of the mesh. Like the collector efficiency, the mesh efficiency has a significantly positive relationship with the MVD (p = 0.0016), is positively related with upstream LWC (p = 0.0024) and is negatively related with leeward LWC (p = 0.0009) given all other variables held constant. In addition, the mesh efficiency is significantly related to the wind direction (p = 0.0003) in that it increases as the wind direction becomes more aligned with the SFC direction. This model has an adjusted R-square of 0.780. The interaction between the upwind and leeward LWC was not statistically significant for the mesh efficiency (p = 0.6521).Measurements from both FM-120 units generally indicate a clear reduction in the droplet numbers, MVD and LWC from the unperturbed ‘free-stream” fog on the upwind side of the SFC to the fog on the leeward side of the SFC, as would be expected. While the numbers of ∼5 μm droplets are reduced by the SFC to in some cases 50 % of their counts in the open-air fog, the volume of fog water reduced by the SFCs experiences its greatest reduction by the loss of relatively fewer droplets but at larger diameters that peak at around 25 μm. The droplets observed at this semi-coastal, low-elevation California location tend to have higher average diameters than those fog droplets observed at higher elevations in other studies done in Chile. Furthermore, the droplet numbers tend to be much lower at these sites compared to the higher-elevation sites at which studies in Chile took place, often close to 100 droplets per centimeter as compared to 300–500 droplets per centimeter in the Chilean studies. Similarly, despite the larger droplet sizes in the current study, the LWC in the coastal fogs observed in this study is typically at least a factor of 2 lower than that associated with the orographic fog observed in the Chilean studies."

 Cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation plays a crucial role in regional cloud-precipitation and global climate. However, inaccuracies in CCN activation parameterization, stemming from the presence of unactivated particles in CCN measurements that are mistakenly included in developing CCN activation parameterizations, can introduce biases in model predictions of cloud droplet number concentration, subsequently affecting cloud microphysics, precipitation initiation, and radiation. To address this issue, this study proposes correction coefficients for CCN activation parameterization using the Twomey power-law function and applies them in the large-eddy model to simulate continental shallow cumulus over the Southern Great Plains, USA. Results reveal that compared to simulations using uncorrected CCN parameterization, those using corrected parameterization decrease cloud droplet number concentration by 32.8 %, leading to an increase of cloud water autoconversion rate by 8.9 % and a decrease of cloud optical thickness by 17.3 %. This indicates a suppression of cloud-precipitation processes and an overestimation of cloud radiative cooling in the default scheme. Moreover, as aerosol loading increases, the differences between the corrected and uncorrected parameterization slightly diminish. Compared to uncorrected CCN parameterization, those using corrected parameterization exhibit stronger cloud sensitivity to aerosols, which partially mitigates the overestimation of cloud radiative cooling in the default scheme. The corrected CCN activation parameterization could help alleviate the overestimation of aerosol indirect effects, particularly in clouds with low supersaturation conditions, thereby contributing to reduced uncertainties in aerosol-cloud interaction simulations.Short summaryCloud condensation nuclei (CCN) are particles that help clouds form, but inaccuracies in measuring them can lead to errors in predicting cloud behavior. This study introduces a correction for CCN activation in models, showing that the uncorrected parameterization can significantly overestimate cloud droplet numbers. The corrected approach provides more accurate predictions, reducing uncertainties in weather and climate models and enhancing our understanding of how aerosols interact with clouds."

 The peak structure of relationships between extreme precipitation intensity (EPI) and temperature has triggered increasing attention. However, investigations into the correlation between extreme precipitation frequency (EPF) and temperature are relatively scarce. Leveraging an extensive dataset of daily precipitation and temperature data from 3825 grids over the 1961–2019 period, our research analyzes the EPI-temperature (EPI-T) and EPF-temperature (EPF-T) relationships at 11 Climate Zones in China. The investigation affirms the presence of peak structures in both EPI-T and EPF-T relationships in all Climate Zones. Significant differences are observed between these two relationships. Asymmetry characterizes the peak structures, with EPI and EPF occurrences more dominant at the low-temperature condition. Spatial disparities in peak structures are more distinct for EPI-T compared to EPF-T. The study also identifies significant spatial differences in the corresponding temperatures at the peaks of EPI (EPIpeaks) and EPF (EPFpeaks), with the highest and lowest peaks distributed in Southeastern China (>20 °C) and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau regions (<10 °C), respectively. Our results highlight that EPF peaks tend to occur at higher temperature conditions than EPI peaks. The peaks of EPI and EPF, as well as the temperatures at these peaks, are likely to increase in response to global warming. Most Climate Zones may experience more intense extreme precipitation peaks and higher associated temperatures in the future. This research contributes essential insights into the complex interplay between extreme precipitation and temperature, which is crucial for mitigating the impacts of climate change."

 The South Asian regions frequently encounter extreme rainfall events (EREs) during the summer monsoon season, causing property damage, environmental harm, and fatalities. Therefore, it is essential to comprehend how these events are evolving and may change in the future, particularly for developing countries like India. This study utilised selected models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) to evaluate the intensity and contribution of EREs to seasonal rainfall during the historical period (1950–2014), as well as to anticipate the variability of extremes in the future period (2015–2100) during the summer monsoon period. Compared to observational rainfall data from the Climatic Research Unit, the selected models showed similar spatial patterns for mean and extreme rainfall in the historical period with regional biases across CMIP6 selected models, mainly in the monsoonal regions such as the west coast, central India, the Himalayas and its foothills, and the northeastern regions. Four EC-Earth models accurately projected mean and extreme rainfall for central India, the southern west coast, and the western Himalayan regions, while NorESM slightly overestimated central India and underestimated) west coast extremes. Moreover, the selected models are not adequate to realistically capture the extremes in northeastern and Myanmar coastal areas. Future scenarios predict significant changes in extreme rainfall over central India and the rain shadow regions of southeast India. The increased ERE in the northern regions of the west coast and southwestern regions of central India could lead to increased vulnerabilities in the area, especially in higher forcing scenarios.

 The influence of microphysical processes on surface wind speeds is primarily indirect, primarily occurring through downdraft cooling and latent heat variations. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was adopted in this study to simulate a squall line that occurred in South China from May 6 to 7, 2023, during which the strongest observed surface wind reached 40.1 m s−1. This study analyzed the impact of microphysical processes on the strong surface winds of the squall line. The results showed that all four microphysics schemes—Thompson, Thompson aerosol-aware (Thompson-A), Morrison, and WSM6—could reproduce the strong winds of the squall line. The Thompson scheme was best suited for simulating the extremely high winds associated with the squall line process selected for this experiment. This scheme generated the strongest winds, largely owing to a concentrated precipitation area that produced strong negative buoyancy in localized regions. This effect was further intensified by high rates of rain evaporation and precipitation particle drag, which reduced downdraft interference and concentrated strong winds in specific areas. Additionally, the smaller raindrop sizes in both the Thompson and Thompson-A schemes enhanced evaporation, increased cooling, and strengthened downdrafts. However, the Thompson scheme achieved greater wind intensities than the Thompson-A scheme because of higher localized evaporation rates and a more focused precipitation distribution. In contrast, the Morrison and WSM6 schemes resulted in more dispersed cooling effects and weaker surface winds owing to broader evaporation areas and increased downdraft interference. However, in the Thompson-A scheme, the actual evaporation was somewhat weaker, likely influenced by the environmental temperature, which, along with the broader precipitation distribution, resulted in weaker surface winds than in the Thompson scheme. The Morrison scheme showed interference among downdrafts as they spread at the surface, leading to weaker surface winds. In the WSM6 scheme, a wider evaporation region and multiple negative buoyancy centers dispersed the effects of negative buoyancy because of broad precipitation and evaporation regions, further weakening the surface winds."

In present study, the multi-model boreal summer seasonal mean SAT prediction skill is investigated using Copernicus Climate Change Services (C3S) and Saudi-KAU Seasonal Forecasting Systems for the period 1993 to 2016. The models are validated against ERA5 reanalysis dataset. The observed maximum SAT variability over the central and northern AP region is captured well by 80 % of the models. We further defined AP temperature index (APTI) based on SAT anomaly over the central and northern AP. A statistically significant negative correlation of −0.52 (95 % confidence level) is noted in ERA5 between El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and APTI. Most of the models successfully capture the ENSO and SAT teleconnections with varying magnitude, except CMCC and DWD models, where opposite relationship is noted. During La Niña (cold ENSO phase) the positive geopotential anomalies over Eurasia strengthen due to the upper-level divergence over the Western Pacific and Eastern Indian Ocean through Sverdrup balance, which favour sinking motion and leads to above-normal temperature anomalies over AP. The opposite tends to happen during El Niño. The deterministic and probabilistic skill of the models are also assessed.

 Northwest Pacific, where the Kuroshio and Oyashio currents intersect, is the most active region of the mid-latitude air-sea interaction. Two dominant patterns of winter cold extremes were determined, i.e., a monopole pattern and a southwest–northeast dipole pattern. Autumn-mean sea surface temperature in northwest Pacific (SSTNWP) significantly impacts the first EOF pattern of the winter cold extremes in China. This research demonstrates that subseasonal SSTNWP reversal—characterized by opposite SSTNWP anomalies between early and late autumn—also affects cold extremes, but mainly on the second EOF pattern. Both observations and numerical experiments demonstrate that the subseasonal SSTNWP reversal in autumn induce an anomalous Eurasian-like pattern in winter. Specifically, early autumn warming followed by late autumn cooling of SSTNWP enhances the northeast China cold vortex, one of the centers of the Eurasian-like pattern, and thus intensified cold advection into northeast China. Concurrently, low-latitude anticyclonic anomalies block the intrusion of northern cold air and induce adiabatic warming in the Sichuan Basin through sinking motion. The second strongest subseasonal SSTNWP reversal resulted in the strongest cold northeast and warm southwest in China in 2001.

To quantify the positive impact of the improved initial TC intensity on the track simulations, we conducted additional simulations with the dynamical initialization (DI) scheme to enhance the initial TC intensity. Compared to the simulations without the DI scheme, the simulations with the DI scheme performed better in simulating TC tracks, with a 20.3 % reduction in TPE at 72-h. The improvement was understood based on the potential vorticity tendency diagnostic analysis. Results show that the TC motion in the simulations with the DI scheme was controlled by both horizontal and vertical advections, while that without the DI scheme was dominated by horizontal advection only, especially in the early stage of simulations when the TC intensity was considerably underpredicted. The finding highlights the importance of improving the initial TC intensity to the TC track simulations/predictions."

 Atmospheric electric filed (AEF) measured at the earthʼs surface varies in time and space in an irregular manner, which makes interpreting the results of such measurements a challenging task. Simultaneous measurements of the AEF using several sensors make it possible to study the spatiotemporal structure of AEF variations associated with local sources. In one dimension there is an optimal placement of sensors along a straight line with distances between them that are proportional to the divisions in the Golomb ruler such that, with a fixed number of sensors, there is a maximum possible number of different pairwise distances. An array of 7 electric field mills in a line and one more at a distance greater than the total length of the Golomb ruler was used to obtain simultaneous observational data set and estimate temporal and spatial autocorrelation functions of AEF variations in the range of distances 2.5–400 m and frequency range 10−3–1 Hz. In addition, to quantitatively describe and interpret the obtained dependences, the autocorrelation functions of the electric field created over a conducting plane by extended one-dimensional random Gaussian charge distribution with exponential autocorrelation function are analyzed. It is found that autocorrelation functions of observed and modeled electric field can be approximated by incomplete gamma functions with parameters depending on the height of charges and the correlation radius in charge distribution. The integral scales of AEF variations of local nature are examined depending on the same parameters, and the time integral scale is found to be inversely depends on the density of zeros of standardized time series of the AEF. The autocorrelation function of electric field created by charges, which are located at a distance from the earthʼs surface, much less than correlation radius in charge distribution, is the same as for the charges, and the rate of its decline decreases with increasing height of the system of charges."

 Severe hail activities have significant impacts on our society because they damage property and are dangerous to people and animals. However, we have little knowledge on recent changes in geographic locations of severe hail activity center over Canada. Prior to exploring this, we have carried out Canada hail data consistency and reliability checks using solid trend analyses of three independent methods for time series of hail counts and days, and robust verifications of reported hail data by a recently developed approach of sample generation by replacement. Here, we discover for the first time a statistically significant east shift of Canada severe hail activity and total hail activity using discriminant analysis. The spatial shift is from the western portion of continental Canada during 2005–2013 to the eastern Canada with a maritime environment during 2014–2022. With increase of hail severity, the hail activities increase from the colder period 2005–2013 to the warmer period 2014–2022. Our composite analyses show that over the continental Canada, the hail activities are enriched through thermodynamically driven convective instability and precipitable water associated with the warming climate, as well as dynamically driven processes such as vertical wind shear and vertically integrated water vapor flux convergence. Over the maritime Canada with the colder condition, the hail activities are enhanced by dynamically driven moisture advection and convergence as well as vertical wind shear, thermodynamically driven process of precipitable water, and partially due to convective instability. This research promotes our understanding of climate change impact on hail activities, shedding lights on long-term hail projection, adaptation, and mitigation strategies."

 Accurate representation of the stable atmospheric surface layer (ASL) in numerical models has been a challenging task due to the occurrence of different physical processes such as radiative transport, turbulent mixing, and the coupling of vegetation with the atmosphere and underlying soil, as well as aspects of land use heterogeneity, etc. The Monin-Obukhov similarity theory has been widely used to parameterize surface turbulent fluxes in numerical models, which utilize similarity functions to account for the effect of atmospheric stability. Over the years, researchers have proposed various forms of similarity functions, depending on different field experiment datasets around the globe. This study incorporates some of the well-established non-linear similarity functions under stable stratification in the revised MM5 surface layer scheme in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model version 4.2.2 and hence develop a scheme that has various functional forms of similarity functions for computing surface turbulent fluxes under stable stratification. The proposed scheme has been evaluated in simulating near-surface atmospheric variables and surface turbulent fluxes over the domain centered around the location of the Ranchi dataset site (23.412oN, 85.440oE; India) and the CASES-99 experiment site (37.38oN, 96.44oW; Kansas, USA) during the months of January 2009 and October 1999, respectively. The modified scheme is also evaluated for the three contrasting nights representative of intermittently turbulent, fully turbulent, and radiative ASL based on the CASES-99 dataset. In general, all the newly installed similarity functions are found to be consistent in predicting surface turbulent fluxes as well as near-surface atmospheric variables with respect to the default surface layer scheme and the observed data derived from the flux towers over the two domains. However, this study reveals that all the similarity functions are found to be inconsistent during the fully turbulent night while they seem comparable for the first and last nights based on the CASES-99 dataset."

 To enhance the understanding of the cloud and rain microphysical characteristics in Meiyu frontal systems, we performed a detailed analysis of stochastic collision processes in Meiyu frontal precipitation clouds, using observational data collected at the Bright Summit Meteorological Station on Huangshan (118°09′E, 30°08′N). By employing stochastic collection and breakup equations, this study investigates the primary microphysical processes influencing cloud and rain microphysical properties. Key findings are as follows: Compared to periods before and after the Meiyu season, the number concentration of small cloud droplets decreases, whereas the number concentration of large cloud droplets increases within the Meiyu season, because of relatively stronger collision-coalescence. Raindrop accretion of cloud droplets dominates the stochastic collision process, gradually reducing cloud droplet number concentration, especially, number concentration of small cloud droplets. Both cloud mean diameter and standard deviation increases with the decreasing cloud droplet number concentration, and the increase of standard deviation dominates. As a result, the correlation between cloud relative dispersion and number concentration is negative in general, but fluctuates for different number concentration ranges. This study enhances the understanding of cloud and rain microphysical processes and could be helpful to the development of microphysical parameterization schemes."

 Two back-to-back heavy rainfall events (HREs) produced enormous rainfall over a pilgrim city, Tirupati, located in the southern peninsular India, during 10–12 November 2021 (149.2 mm) and 17–19 November 2021 (234.2 mm). Surface measurements at Yerpedu, Tirupati (13.74°, 79.60°E) showed a drop of 2–3 °C in temperature and 8 hPa in pressure during HREs, indicating that these HREs were associated with two landfalling tropical depressions from the Bay of Bengal. The sporadic HREs in the past three decades caused floods over Tirupati and devastated landslides in the sacred Tirumala hills especially during the second HRE. Fundamental understanding of diurnal cycle of surface radiation is critical to model the climate. The effect of HREs on the surface essential climate variables at diurnal scale indicate a reduction in peak solar and net radiations by 500 W m−2 (> 62.5 %). Similar to observations, ERA5 reanalysis also indicates a significant reduction in net surface solar and thermal radiations, which are nearly equal in terms of % but vary in magnitude. Net solar and thermal radiations show dominant diurnal cycles with a reduced (66.7 % and 74.4 % respectively) diurnal amplitudes from no-rain to HREs. Soil moisture drydown curves at 5- and 10-cm depths shows 3 h long e-folding decay time for HREs, indicating an enhanced soil moisture memory after HREs. The soil drying process takes longer time at 10 cm than at 5 cm depth. Soil temperatures are significantly low at 5 cm to 30 cm depths and less than the 50 cm depth with weak diurnal variation during the events. The reflectivity (Z)-rain rate (R) and shape (μ)-slope (Λ) relations show variations from HREs to normal rain events. Knowing the importance of land-atmospheric processes feedbacks in model predictions at diurnal scale, this study quantified the HREs impact on surface essential climate variables, especially the energy balance and soil variables."

 In 2021, an exceptionally intense autumn rainfall event occurred in West China (WC), breaking historical precipitation records since 1961. A notable northward migration of rainfall center was observed during the season. This study utilized real-time forecast data from the ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) and CMA (China Meteorological Administration) models under the S2S (Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Prediction) project to examine the subseasonal predictability of the extreme ARWC event and its associated systems, providing a theoretical basis for forecasting extreme autumn rainfall. The results showed that both models underestimated the observed anomalous precipitation, however, ECMWF was able to predict the spatial distribution and intensity of different phases of the event up to 8 days in advance, while the CMA model exhibited poor skill. ECMWF and CMA both successfully predicted the intraseasonal northward migration of the rainfall 8 days and 5 days in advance, respectively. Further analysis revealed that ECMWF and CMA can reproduce the mid–high-latitude wave patterns associated with the intraseasonal variations in the EAWJ at lead times of 1–10 days, contributing to better predictions of the intraseasonal northward migration of the rainfall. Their ability to predict the tropical convection differed, with ECMWF more accurately reproducing the anomalous dipole tropical convection activities over the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool and the central-eastern Pacific 1–22 days in advance, and the characteristic that the convection eventually weakens over the maritime continent. This led to better predictions of the intraseasonal variations of the WPSH, giving the ECMWF model a higher forecasting skill for both periods of the extreme ARWC in 2021 compared to the CMA model."

 A deep convective system affected the southern Mediterranean on 3–4 December 2022 causing heavy rains and wind gusts over three Italian regions (Sicily, Calabria, and Apulia) and a tornado in Calabria. We study the forecast sensitivity of this multi-hazard weather event to different physical parameterizations and configuration settings of the WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) model, used at convection permitting horizontal resolution; in particular, we performed sensitivity tests on the role of the initial and boundary conditions, on the Sea Surface Temperature (SST), on the model horizontal resolution and on the cumulus parameterization. Moreover, a 6 h rapid update data assimilation analysis (3DVAR)/forecast cycle was investigated to further study the short-term forecast capabilities of the modeling system. Most of the WRF configurations are able to well simulate the characteristics of the weather system, even if there are differences among the configurations, especially at the local scale, which causes differences in forecast performances. We found that the quality of the forecast is sensitive to the initial and boundary conditions with the best members having a probability of detection around 30–40 % for rainfall intensities of 40–50 mm/6 h. Most of the forecasts decrease their performance for larger precipitation thresholds, with few exceptions. Specifically, we found that increasing the horizontal resolution was beneficial for the case study as the probability of detection remains larger than 0.2 for rainfall thresholds larger than 60 mm/6 h and up to 100 mm/6 h. In addition, the forecast with lightning and radar reflectivity data assimilation has a probability of detection larger than 0.4 for the same intense thresholds; in both cases false alarms are not increased.

 Drought forecasting is important for water resources management and effective response to drought, and the predictability of drought may change under a changing environment. Most of the studies have focused on developing drought forecasting techniques, but limited attention has been made to the theory of drought predictability, such as dynamics of meteorological drought predictability and possible driving mechanism. Here, we characterized the predictability of meteorological drought, based on the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE"") coefficient of support vector machine regression model. Then we measured the spatial distribution, agglomeration, and dynamic changes of drought predictability, and quantitatively analyzed the main driving forces and relationships of the spatial and temporal dynamics. The Loess Plateau (LP), which is a drought-prone region with frail ecological environment in China, was chosen as a case study. Results indicated that: (1) drought predictability in the western region was higher than that in the eastern region of the LP, with the hot spots concentrated in the western sandy land and agricultural irrigation; (2) meteorological drought predictability in the LP showed a downward trend from 1962 to 2019 under the changing environment, which the autumn drought predictability declined significantly; (3) meteorological, terrestrial factors and air-sea coupling elements dominated the spatial-temporal pattern of meteorological drought predictability via strongly affecting the coefficient of variation of drought index series, and related causal paths were explored.

 Snowfall plays a crucial role in the mountainous cryosphere cycle and is significantly influenced by climate change. This study utilizes the global climate models (GCMs) from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) with multivariate bias correction (MBC) to explore potential future variations in snowfall and its elevation dependency across the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Findings indicate a consistent decline in annual snowfall across the majority of the TP by the end of the century, except for certain high-elevation regions in the northwest. The decreasing trend is projected to intensify with strengthen Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios and exhibits elevation dependency below 5000 m. Specifically, under the SSP5–8.5 scenario, snowfall over the TP is expected to decrease by 39.74 % in the far future (2071–2100), with the elevation zone below 2000 m experiencing the most intense decline of approximately 62 %. This trend is largely attributed to the significant warming, which reduces the snow fraction as more precipitation falls as rain rather than snow. This shift is evidenced by the identification of turning points in snow fraction in the mid-2040s to 2050s, coinciding with rapid temperature increases. Furthermore, substantial decreases in future (heavy) snowfall days contribute to the overall reduction in snowfall. However, complex interplay between increased precipitation and temperature effects results in a slight increase in snowfall over high elevation areas in the northern edge. Uncertainty analysis indicates model uncertainty as the dominant source in snowfall projections, accounting for over 50 % of total variance. The projected declines in snowfall and snow fraction, as well as shortened snowfall days could considerably impact the cryosphere, hydrological and ecological systems of the TP."

 Recently, the frequency of heatwaves has increased worldwide, with significant implications for public health, the environment, and socio-economic stability. In densely populated urban areas such as Hong Kong, heatwave events are of particular concern owing to their potential to exacerbate air pollution and modulate weather patterns, including extreme precipitation events. Despite extensive research on these phenomena, there exists a gap in understanding the interconnections of heatwaves, pollution, and extreme precipitation in subtropical urban climates. Utilising in-situ meteorological data from the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO), we investigated the characteristics of heatwaves and explored their impact on pollution and local rainfall. We observed a significant increase in the frequency, intensity, and duration of heatwaves in Hong Kong, particularly after 2010. Synoptic analysis indicates that these heatwaves are often associated with persistent high-pressure systems or tropical cyclones periphery downdrafts, as these patterns could induce subsidence and reduce cloud cover, which contributes to temperature increase. Additionally, heatwaves significantly elevated concentrations of ground-level ozone and particulate matter owing to increased photochemical reactions and stagnant air conditions. These pollution spikes coincide with heatwaves, aggravating public health risks. Furthermore, the increased frequency of heatwaves has altered the composition of local precipitation, with heatwave-following extreme precipitation events occurring more frequently, suggesting a thermal-driven amplification of the hydrological cycle. Our results highlight the urgent need for integrated urban planning and health policies that address the compounding effects of heatwaves, pollution, and subsequent extreme precipitation, underscoring the importance of adapting to and mitigating these linked phenomena amid a changing climate."
