10.5194/acp-25-10747-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了通过在欧洲进行密集的Δ14CO2瓶采样监测活动来约束化石燃料CO2排放的方法。它通过模拟实验评估了不同采样策略对化石燃料排放估算的影响，包括采样频率、基于化石CO2含量和核活动影响的选择。研究结果表明，增加采样频率，并根据化石CO2和核14CO2的组成精心选择样本，可以提高化石燃料排放估算的准确性，降低不确定性和偏差。虽然该研究没有直接涉及卫星观测或遥感技术，但它与大气环境监测和大气成分分析密切相关，特别是通过地面采样来验证和改进大气传输模型，从而间接支持卫星遥感数据的应用。,"['fossil CO2 emissions', 'Δ14CO2', 'inverse modeling', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'air quality monitoring', 'nuclear 14CO2 contamination']",Carlos Gómez-Ortiz;Guillaume Monteil;Ute Karstens;Marko Scholze,Modeling support for an extensive Δ14CO2 flask sample monitoring campaign over Europe to constrain fossil CO2 emissions,"In 2024, an intensive sampling campaign was conducted to improve fossil CO2 emission estimates in Europe using 14C measurements. By testing different strategies for selecting air samples, this study shows that increasing sample frequency and carefully choosing samples based on their fossil fuel and nuclear content leads to more accurate results, reducing the uncertainty and bias of the estimates. 
 During 2024, an intensive Δ14CO2 flask sampling campaign was conducted at 12 sampling stations across Europe as part of the CO2MVS Research on Supplementary Observations (CORSO) project. These Δ14CO2 samples, combined with CO2 atmospheric measurements, are intended to enhance the estimation of fossil CO2 emissions over Europe through inverse modeling. In this study, we perform a series of Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) to evaluate the added value of such an intensive campaign as well as the different flask sample selection strategies on estimating fossil fuel emissions. We explore three main selection strategies and compare them against the currently more widely used method of two-week integrated samples: (1) collecting flask samples every 3 d according to a uniform schedule, without applying specific selection criteria; (2) selecting flask samples with high fossil CO2 content to better isolate anthropogenic signals; and (3) combining fossil CO2 selection with consideration of nuclear 14CO2 contamination to reduce potential biases from nuclear emissions. The results suggest that higher sampling density improves the estimation of fossil CO2 emissions, particularly during periods of high fossil fuel activity, such as in winter, while integrated sampling remains more effective during summer months when emissions are lower. Increasing the number of flask samples significantly reduces uncertainty and enhances the robustness of inverse modeling results. In addition, selecting samples with a high fossil CO2 content shows potential for improving the accuracy of emission estimates. The largest reduction in uncertainty is achieved when sample selection actively avoids periods of potential high nuclear 14CO2 contamination. This approach helps minimize potential biases, particularly in regions with significant nuclear activity such as France and the UK. These findings highlight the importance of not only increasing sampling frequency but also carefully selecting samples based on their fossil CO2 and nuclear 14CO2 composition to improve the reliability of fossil fuel emission estimates across Europe."
10.5194/acp-25-10707-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要探讨了α-蒎烯氧化过程中氮氧化物（NOx）的归宿和有机硝酸盐的化学过程，通过稳定氧和氮同位素技术，追踪了大气中氮化合物的转化和颗粒物的形成。研究结果有助于理解这些反应在空气污染中的作用，并为改进空气质量和气候政策的预测提供工具。虽然该论文没有直接涉及遥感技术或卫星观测，但其对大气成分（特别是氮氧化物和有机硝酸盐）的分析，以及对空气质量影响的评估，与大气环境遥感技术在空气质量监测和大气成分分析方面的应用密切相关。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术具有较强的相关性。,"['NOx', 'Organic nitrates', 'α-pinene oxidation', 'Air quality', 'Atmospheric composition', 'Nitrate formation mechanisms']",Wendell W.

Hastings,Evaluating NOx fate and organic nitrate chemistry from α-pinene oxidation using stable oxygen and nitrogen isotopes,"We studied how chemicals released from plants and pollution interact in the atmosphere, affecting air quality and climate. By combining laboratory experiments and chemistry models, we tracked unique chemical fingerprints to understand how nitrogen compounds transform to form particles in the air. Our findings help explain the role of these reactions in pollution and provide tools to improve predictions for cleaner air and better climate policies. 
 The oxidation of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) such as α-pinene in the presence of nitrogen oxides (NOx= NO + NO2) initiates complex photochemical processes that produce organic nitrates (RONO2) and influence atmospheric oxidation capacity, air quality, and the fate of reactive nitrogen. However, tracking the chemical fate of RONO2 remains challenging as it includes pathways such as renoxification, aerosol partitioning, deposition, and/or hydrolysis to nitric acid (HNO3). Stable oxygen (Δ17O, δ18O) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotope measurements can provide a unique tool to probe these processes, as NOy species can exhibit distinct isotopic signatures due to characteristic oxygen-transfer dynamics and isotope fractionation. Here, we present chamber experiments of α-pinene oxidation in the presence of NOx under a range of oxidant and photochemical conditions, reporting the Δ17O, δ18O, and δ15N values of simultaneously collected NO2, HNO3, and particulate nitrate (pNO3), the latter of which derived predominantly from RONO2 in the conducted experiments. A strong linear relationship between δ18O and Δ17O across all NOy species (r=0.992; p<0.01) supports a two-endmember mixing model, in which oxygen atoms are transferred from isotopically distinct sources that include ozone (O3) with high δ18O and Δ17O as well as peroxy and hydroxyl radicals (RO2, HO2, OH) with lower values. Nitrogen isotope fractionation, quantified as the difference in δ15N values (Δδ15N), revealed consistently positive Δδ15N(HNO3–NO2) values (+28.9 ± 13.4 ‰ in daytime experiments; +22.2 ± 1.4 ‰ at night) and negative Δδ15N(pNO3–NO2) values (−13.6 ± 5.8 ‰ in daytime experiments). This reflected distinct formation pathways and isotope effects including NOx photochemical cycling, thermal dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5)–nitrate radical (NO3)–NO2 equilibrium, and HNO3 production mechanisms. Box-model simulations based on Δ17O values as a constraint were conducted using a newly developed gas-phase mechanism, which reproduced Δ17O(NO2) and Δ17O(pNO3) (compared to simulated Δ17O(RONO2)) accurately, with an average model bias of 0.9 ± 2.4 ‰ (R2=0.98) and −1.4 ± 2.4 ‰ (R2= 0.55 and R2= 0.97 when excluding one outlier), respectively. We further empirically derived important isotopic parameters such as the Δ17O value transferred from O3 through comparison of model-simulated oxygen atom source contributions with observed Δ17O values for NO2 and pNO3 across experiments. This yielded best-fit slopes of 39.4 ± 0.6 ‰ for NOx photochemical cycling and 41.7 ± 1.2 ‰ for RONO2 formation, consistent with near-surface observations of Δ17O in the terminal oxygen atom of O3. Despite the agreement with NO2 and RONO2, accurately simulating Δ17O(HNO3) proved challenging. Sensitivity tests revealed that model biases likely stemmed from a combination of factors including background HNO3 chamber blanks affecting low-NOx experiments, missing N2O5 heterogeneous hydrolysis under nighttime conditions, and an overestimation in the Δ17O(HNO3) mass balance resulting from the NO2+ OH reaction, which was improved by adjusting the contribution from (2/3)Δ17O(NO2) to (1/2)Δ17O(NO2). These adjustments reduced the average model bias in Δ17O(HNO3) from 6.7 ± 3.3 ‰ (R2= 0.39) in the base mechanism to 1.6 ± 1.3 ‰ (R2= 0.48) in the modified mechanism. These findings demonstrate the utility of Δ17O and δ15N for disentangling nitrate formation mechanisms, while also highlighting critical gaps in our understanding of the isotope dynamics involving HNO3 formation. Future experimental work targeting isolated HNO3 pathways is essential to refine isotopic mass balance assumptions and nitrogen isotope fractionation."

The aqueous reaction medium conditions, dilute cloud/fog vs. concentrated aqueous aerosol conditions, governed the effects that pH, ionic strength, and sulfate have on the GLV degradation rates and aqueous secondary organic aerosol (aqSOA) mass yields. Most notably, reactions initiated by sulfate photolysis have significant effects in aqueous aerosols but not in cloud/fog droplets. 
 Biotic and abiotic stresses can lead to terrestrial green plants releasing green leaf volatiles (GLVs), which can partition into atmospheric aqueous phases where they can undergo oxidation to form aqueous secondary organic aerosol (aqSOA). Anthropogenic emission changes have resulted in nitrate becoming an increasingly important component of atmospheric aqueous phases, which has significant implications for aqSOA formation since nitrate photolysis produces oxidants. Nevertheless, sulfate remains the main inorganic aqueous component in most regions, and thus it controls the pH and ionic strength of atmospheric aqueous phases. We report results from laboratory investigations of the effects of pH, ionic strength, and sulfate on the reaction kinetics and aqSOA formation of the aqueous nitrate-mediated photooxidation of four GLVs: cis-3-hexen-1-ol, trans-2-hexen-1-ol, trans-2-penten-1-ol, and 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol. Our results showed that the aqueous reaction medium conditions, i.e., dilute cloud/fog vs. concentrated aqueous aerosol conditions, governed the effects that pH, ionic strength, and sulfate have on the GLV degradation rates and aqSOA mass yields. Most notably, reactions initiated by sulfate photolysis will have significant effects on the GLV degradation rates and aqSOA mass yields in aqueous aerosols but not in cloud/fog droplets. In addition to providing new insights into aqSOA formation from the aqueous reactions of GLVs in regions with substantial concentrations of nitrate in cloud, fog, and aqueous aerosols, this study highlights how nitrate and sulfate photochemistries can couple together to influence the reactions of water-soluble organic compounds and their aqSOA formation in aqueous aerosols, which have implications for our evaluations of aqueous organic aerosol lifetimes and composition."
10.5194/acp-25-10691-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注商业微塑料（如亮片和纤维）在大气中的沉降行为及其潜在的运输距离。虽然涉及大气传输，但重点在于微塑料的物理特性如何影响其在大气中的分布，而非利用遥感技术进行大气环境监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强。,"['microplastics', 'atmospheric transport', 'settling velocity', 'glitter', 'fibers']",Alina Sylvia Waltraud Reininger;Daria Tatsii;Taraprasad Bhowmick;Gholamhossein Bagheri;Andreas Stohl,The atmospheric settling of commercially sold microplastics,"Microplastics are transported over large distances in the atmosphere, but the shape-dependence of their atmospheric transport lacks investigation. We conducted laboratory experiments and atmospheric transport simulations to study the settling of commercially sold microplastics. We found that films settle up to 74 % slower and travel up to ~ 4x further than volume-equivalent spheres. Our work emphasizes the role of the atmosphere as a transport medium for commercial microplastics such as glitter. 
 The atmosphere plays a major role in the dispersion of microplastics in the environment. The atmospheric transport of large microplastics is strongly influenced by their settling behavior, which depends on their physical properties, including size and shape. However, experimental data on the settling behavior of commercially available microplastics with complex, nonspherical shapes in air are rare. Here we present experiments on the gravitational settling velocity of commercially available glitters (nominal diameters between 0.1 and 3 mm) and fibers (lengths between 1.2 and 5 mm). We observed that glitters and fibers settle up to 74 %  and 78 % slower compared to volume-equivalent spheres, respectively. The atmospheric transport of fibers has been studied previously; however, there are no studies on the atmospheric transport potential of glitters. Therefore, we used an atmospheric transport model constrained by our experimental results to assess the transport potential of glitters. Our results reveal that glitters exhibit transport distances 12 %–261 % greater than volume-equivalent spheres, highlighting their elevated atmospheric transport potential. As a result, the environmental impact of glitter particles, especially following their use in entertainment events, warrants attention and mitigation."

The design maximizes instrument optical stability over the wide range of temperatures experienced during flight. We demonstrate that key changes in the redesigned instrument have significantly improved the performance and precision of water vapor measurements. We did this research to enable improved scientific instrumentation for aircraft. 
 To improve the accuracy and precision of in situ water vapor measurements from aircraft, a new opto-mechanical design was implemented on the JPL Laser Hygrometer Mark2. The first JPL Laser Hygrometer (JLH Mark1), originally developed in mid-1990s, provided airborne in situ water vapor measurements for fifteen years from several platforms, including the NASA ER-2 and WB-57 aircraft. Due to heavy use over the years and aging of the instrument parts, many of the components in JLH Mark1 have been modified and replaced. This instrument paper reports on the redesigned opto-mechanical structure of the instrument, new data retrieval algorithms, and updated data analysis procedures, along with recent laboratory and field performance and a comparison with another water vapor instrument. Key changes in the redesigned instrument have significantly improved the performance, as demonstrated during the NASA Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC4RS) field mission and eight years of subsequent science flights on the Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation Flying Test Bed (FTB)."

Vogel,Real-time organic aerosol characterization via Orbitrap mass spectrometry in urban and agricultural environments,"We successfully deployed an online high-resolution Orbitrap MS (mass spectrometer) during field campaigns in urban and heavily polluted agricultural environments (Po Valley). The instrument provides high time and mass resolution, enabling the detection of short-term pollution events like biomass burning and diurnal patterns of CHO and CHON compounds. Laboratory experiments confirm its broad applicability to detect biogenic and anthropogenic compounds. 
 Mass spectrometry techniques traditionally deployed in the field often operate at low mass resolution, making it hard to unambiguously identify and attribute organic molecules. In this regard, in-situ, accurate and precise online mass-spectrometric measurements of organic molecules in atmospheric organic aerosol (OA) are essential for understanding its sources, formation and chemical composition. In this study, we demonstrate the field applicability of a high-resolution (Orbitrap) mass spectrometer with Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization (APCI-Orbitrap-MS) for real-time ambient OA measurements, achieving online, molecular resolution at atmospherically relevant concentrations with a high temporal resolution of 1 s, mass resolution of R = 120 000 at m/z 200, and mass accuracy of ±1.5 ppm. These features enable chemically reliable measurements in environments that are exhibiting chemically complex aerosol composition, through molecular-level detection and identification of anthropogenic pollutants, biogenic and biomass burning tracers. As proof of principle, we deployed the APCI-Orbitrap-MS for in-situ measurements in a mobile laboratory container at an urban background station at Campus Riedberg (CR, Frankfurt am Main, Germany) and an agricultural field site in Schivenoglia (SKI, Italy) in the heavily polluted Po Valley. The APCI-Orbitrap-MS showed good agreement with the organic aerosol mass of an aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM), with Pearson's R values of 0.91 and 0.70 for the urban and agricultural sites, respectively. In SKI, we resolved distinct diurnal variations in compounds such as MBTCA (C8H12O6), a biogenic marker of photochemical aging, and C8H13O8N, an organic nitrate indicative of nighttime chemistry. Additionally, nighttime biomass burning events were detected frequently, with durations ranging from 10 to 40 min, emphasizing the importance of high temporal resolution. During these events we found up to 30 isobaric peaks per unit mass that are baseline-resolved. For the first time, the hydroxypinonyl ester of cis-pinic acid (C19H28O7) could be measured and confirmed with MS2 experiments in ambient aerosol by an in-situ method at CR. In addition, laboratory experiments were performed to confirm the broad applicability of the APCI-Orbitrap-MS for the real-time detection of biogenic and biomass burning tracers, as well as specific anthropogenic pollutants, such as pesticides, organophosphates or organic esters from aircraft lubrication oil."

Most reanalyses are Eulerian, providing data at specific, fixed points in space and time. When studying how air moves, it is more convenient to follow air masses through space and time, requiring a Lagrangian Reanalysis (LARA). We explain how the LARA dataset is organised and provide four examples of applications. These include studying the evolution of wind patterns, understanding weather systems, and measuring air mass travel time over land. 
 Meteorological reanalyses are crucial datasets in atmospheric research, providing the foundation for many scientific applications. However, most reanalyses follow a Eulerian framework, providing data at specific, fixed points in space and time. This fixed-location approach is suitable for many scientific analyses, but studies focused on transport in the atmosphere would benefit from a Lagrangian framework, which provides data along dynamic, continuous trajectories following the movement of air.To achieve this, the Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART was driven offline with data from ECMWF’s (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) latest reanalysis, ERA5, to convert the Eulerian ERA5 data into a Lagrangian format. FLEXPART utilises the grid-scale winds from ERA5 and stochastic parameterisations of turbulence and convection to advect particles in a domain-filling mode, where the global atmosphere is represented by 6 million particles that move freely in the atmosphere, with their number density following closely the density of air. The resulting new Lagrangian Reanalysis (LARA: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14639472, Bakels, 2025) dataset has been stored in an easily searchable database and made accessible to researchers all over the world. It will enable a wide range of studies, including global and regional analyses of extreme events, water and energy transport in the atmosphere, and atmospheric energy budgets.Here, we describe the data format and how the data can be accessed and analysed. Using four examples, we give a non-exhaustive list of possible applications for which LARA could be used for. We show methods for how the evolution of air masses and their properties can be studied and how climatologies can be established. Our examples include a study of the evolution of the Hadley cell circulation, a climatology of warm conveyor belt events, a measure of continentality based on the time it takes for air to reach land from the ocean, and an evaluation of the dynamical consistency between subsequent ERA5 meteorological fields."

Using simulations, we developed a more accurate method that works efficiently, making it suitable for application in weather and climate prediction models. The new approach is numerically verified and provides precise predictions of ice formation events and reliable estimates of key parameters. 
 The present work aims to extend the parameterisation of homogeneous ice nucleation introduced in Dolaptchiev et al. (2023) by incorporating variable ice mean mass and generalising the approach under different conditions. The proposed method involves introducing an empirically derived correction to the parameterisation based on a large data set of parcel model simulations to account for the mean ice particle mass variations. The method is validated against ensemble simulations using time-resolved double-moment ice microphysics, showing a mean relative error of less than 16 %, with robust performance across a range of conditions. The uncertainty of the proposed parameterisation is evaluated for increasing integration time steps. The method remains computationally efficient and produces sufficiently accurate results, even with larger time steps, making it suitable for integration into numerical weather prediction and climate models. It is shown that the generalised approach not only provides a good representation of individual nucleation events but also effectively captures the statistics across the ensemble data. The prediction of the ice mixing ratio is also assessed against the reference double-moment system results. It is demonstrated that, following the nucleation event and re-initialisation of the ice mixing ratio, the system equilibrates toward the reference solution within a few time steps. This refined parameterisation offers a more accurate prediction of ice number concentration and ice mixing ratio, is not limited to perturbations induced by gravity waves (GWs), and can be supplemented by other relevant dynamical effects, such as large-scale motions or even turbulence."

These storms are responsible for substantial heat transport across the mid‐latitudes and deliver large amounts of precipitation to impacted locations. ARs occasionally penetrate the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes, resulting in elevated temperatures and anomalous precipitation, which can have a major influence on the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS), yet the impact ARs may have had on the GrIS in past climates remains unexplored. The Last Interglacial (LIG; 130,000–115,000 years before present) featured a warmer Arctic than present and a smaller GrIS configuration, providing an ideal time period for characterizing how AR impacts on the GrIS respond to orbital forcing and GrIS topography. Here, we use existing simulations spanning the LIG with a dynamic GrIS to study AR behavior around the GrIS. Results show that there are two mechanisms for AR migration through the LIG. There is a dynamical control across the mid‐latitudes through orbitally induced migrations of the prevailing winds and a thermodynamic control at high latitudes due to changes in atmospheric moisture. This results in more warm season ARs at high latitudes early in the LIG which drive substantial melt around the margins of the GrIS and accumulation on the ice sheet interior. Future AR impacts on the GrIS are shown to be similar to the early LIG where an increase in high latitude moisture increases summertime ARs and thus ice sheet ablation around the GrIS margins."

Compared to the Front type, the Warm type shows a significantly deeper convective structure with a larger number of large‐size hydrometeors. This results in lower number concentration and larger mean size of surface raindrops.

A total of 49 SSW and 31 S0 events were identified, with all S0 events occurring within ±20 days of SSW onset. Of these, 95% of S0 events occurred within 8.9 days of the nearest SSW onset, indicating a temporal association between S0 and SSW events. We classified the S0 into four scenarios: before and during major and minor SSW events. The average peak amplitude of S0 was higher before the onset of major SSW and after the onset of minor SSW, with the average peak amplitudes reaching 25.6 and 26.1 m/s, respectively. This variation is related to the Arctic background wind field: weak westerlies before major SSWs facilitate the propagation of S0, while reversed winds during SSWs suppress its propagation. In contrast, during minor SSW events, the weakening westerlies are favorable for the propagation of S0. Among the 31 identified S0 events, 13 (42%) are likely triggered by nonlinear interactions between traveling planetary waves and the stationary planetary wave with zonal wave number 1 (SPW1), as demonstrated by Eliassen‐Palm (EP) flux diagnostics and nonlinear interaction analysis. For the remaining 58% of events, other mechanisms, such as wave‐mean flow interactions and momentum deposition from gravity waves and tides, may be responsible."

During the Australian forest fires in 2019/2020, such convective plumes transported quantities of smoke into the tropopause region comparable to those of a large volcanic eruption. In this study, we investigate the heat emission threshold at which wildfire plumes transition into pyroCbs. We examine the sensitivity of the pyroCb to further changes in the total amount of heat released as well as to the latent to sensible heat flux ratio. Using the extreme Australian New Years Eve PyroCb event as a case study, we perform semi‐idealized simulations with a regional high‐resolution atmospheric model. The so simulated plumes show a pronounced bimodal behavior with an abrupt onset of pyroCb formation when the sensible heat flux exceeds 50 kW m−2. When a cloud is formed within the plume, the plume top height is mainly controlled by the sum of the sensible and latent heat flux, while the ratio between the two plays a subordinate role. Increasing either heat flux raises the plume water content and temperature anomaly within the cloud. The strong differences below the cloud between plumes with equal total heat flux but different sensible heat‐to‐latent heat ratios are buffered by changes in the cloud base height. These results show the importance of accurate estimates of heat and moisture released by fires for predicting pyroCb development. Encouragingly, a reliable estimate of the total heat flux might be sufficient to characterize the behavior of pyroCbs, reducing the need for detailed partitioning of sensible and latent heat."

 Global warming intensifies wildfires and exacerbates greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions1. However, global projections remain incomplete, hindering effective policy interventions amid uncertain warming futures2. Here, we developed an interpretable machine learning framework to project global burned areas and wildfire emissions. This framework accounts for the impacts of future climate change on fire activity and quantifies associated premature deaths and radiative forcing from fire-induced particulate matter (PM2.5). Here we show that from 2010–2014 to 2095–2099, fire carbon emissions are projected to increase by 23% under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 2-4.5. Increased fire-related aerosols reduce the 0.06 W m⁻² cooling effect north of 60°N. Projections show a surge in premature deaths from wildfire smoke, reaching 1.40 (95% Confidence Interval: 0.66–2.25) million annually during 2095–2099, roughly 6 times higher than current levels. Africa is projected to experience the greatest rise in fire-related deaths (11-fold), driven by emission changes and an aging population. Europe and the U.S. would experience a 1–2-fold increase under SSP2-4.5, linked to rising fire occurrences in the mid-latitude Northern Hemisphere. Overall, the health burden would become more evenly distributed across nations of differing development levels than present patterns, underscoring the need for coordinated efforts."

 Wildfire activity has increased in the US and is projected to accelerate under future climate change 1–3. However, our understanding of the impacts of climate change on wildfire activity, smoke, and health outcomes remains highly uncertain, due to the difficulty of modeling the causal chain from climate to wildfire to air pollution and health. Here we quantify the mortality burden in the US due to wildfire smoke fine particulate matter (PM2.5) under climate change. We construct an ensemble of statistical and machine learning models that link climate to wildfire smoke PM2.5, and empirically estimate smoke PM2.5-mortality relationships using data on all recorded deaths in the US. We project that smoke PM2.5 could result in 71,420 excess deaths (95% CI: 34,930 - 98,430) per year by 2050 under a high warming scenario (SSP3-7.0) – a 73% increase relative to estimated 2011-2020 average annual excess deaths from smoke. Cumulative excess deaths from smoke PM2.5 could reach 1.9 million between 2026-2055. We find evidence for mortality impacts of smoke PM2.5 that last up to three years after exposure. When monetized, climate-driven smoke deaths result in economic damages that exceed existing estimates of climate-driven damages from all other causes combined in the US 4,5. Our research suggests that the health impacts of climate-driven wildfire smoke could be among the most important and costly consequences of a warming climate in the US."

 Neuroendocrine and tuft cells are rare chemosensory epithelial lineages defined by the expression of ASCL1 and POU2F3 transcription factors, respectively. Neuroendocrine cancers, including small cell lung cancer (SCLC), frequently display tuft-like subsets, a feature linked to poor patient outcomes1–9. The mechanisms driving neuroendocrine–tuft tumour heterogeneity and the origins of tuft-like cancers are unknown. Using multiple genetically engineered animal models of SCLC, we demonstrate that a basal cell of origin (but not the accepted neuroendocrine origin) generates neuroendocrine–tuft-like tumours that highly recapitulate human SCLC. Single-cell clonal analyses of basal-derived SCLC further uncovered unexpected transcriptional states, including an Atoh1+ state, and lineage trajectories underlying neuroendocrine–tuft plasticity. Uniquely in basal cells, the introduction of genetic alterations enriched in human tuft-like SCLC, including high MYC, PTEN loss and ASCL1 suppression, cooperates to promote tuft-like tumours. Transcriptomics of 944 human SCLCs revealed a basal-like subset and a tuft–ionocyte-like state that altogether demonstrate notable conservation between cancer states and normal basal cell injury response mechanisms10–13. Together, these data indicate that the basal cell is a probable origin for SCLC and other neuroendocrine–tuft cancers that can explain neuroendocrine–tuft heterogeneity, offering new insights for targeting lineage plasticity.

 Autonomic dysreflexia is a life-threatening medical condition characterized by episodes of uncontrolled hypertension that occur in response to sensory stimuli after spinal cord injury (SCI)1. The fragmented understanding of the mechanisms underlying autonomic dysreflexia hampers the development of therapeutic strategies to manage this condition, leaving people with SCI at daily risk of heart attack and stroke2–5. Here we expose the neuronal architecture that develops after SCI and causes autonomic dysreflexia. In parallel, we uncover a competing, yet overlapping neuronal architecture activated by epidural electrical stimulation of the spinal cord that safely regulates blood pressure after SCI. The discovery that these adversarial neuronal architectures converge onto a single neuronal subpopulation provided a blueprint for the design of a mechanism-based intervention that reversed autonomic dysreflexia in mice, rats and humans with SCI.

 Most neurodevelopmental disorders with single gene diagnoses act via haploinsufficiency, in which only one of the two gene copies is functional1. SCN2A haploinsufficiency is one of the most frequent causes of neurodevelopmental disorder, often presenting with autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability and, in a subset of children, refractory epilepsy2. Here, using SCN2A haploinsufficiency as a proof-of-concept, we show that upregulation of the existing functional gene copy through CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) can rescue neurological-associated phenotypes in Scn2a haploinsufficient mice. We first show that restoring Scn2a expression in adolescent heterozygous Scn2a conditional knock-in mice rescues electrophysiological deficits associated with Scn2a haploinsufficiency (Scn2a+/−). Next, using an adeno-associated virus CRISPRa-based treatment in adolescent mice, we show that we can correct intrinsic and synaptic deficits in neocortical pyramidal cells, a major cell type that contributes to neurodevelopmental disorders and seizure aetiology in SCN2A haploinsufficiency. Furthermore, we find that systemic delivery of CRISPRa protects Scn2a+/− mice against chemoconvulsant-induced seizures. Finally, we also show that adeno-associated virus CRISPRa treatment rescues excitability in SCN2A haploinsufficient human stem-cell-derived neurons. Our results showcase the potential of this therapeutic approach to rescue SCN2A haploinsufficiency and demonstrates that rescue even at adolescent stages can ameliorate neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Using SCN2A haploinsufficiency as a proof-of-concept, upregulation of the existing functional gene copy through CRISPR activation was able to rescue neurological-associated phenotypes in Scn2a haploinsufficient mice and human neurons."

 Land disturbances are fundamental drivers of terrestrial ecosystem dynamics, influencing biodiversity, carbon cycling and land–atmosphere interactions. An understanding of changes in their regimes is crucial for predicting future ecosystem trajectories and guiding sustainable land management. Here we leverage the long-term record of Landsat imagery to create high-resolution (30 m) maps of annual land disturbance agents across the contiguous USA from 1988 to 2022. We find that 178.50 million hectares of US land have been cumulatively disturbed over this period. Human-directed disturbances account for 65% of this total, driven by logging, agricultural disturbance and construction. Our analysis reveals a widespread decline in human-directed disturbances (−59.21 kha yr−1) alongside a countervailing surge (20.31 kha yr−1) in less controllable, undirected ‘wild’ disturbances (fire, wind/geohazard and vegetation stress), which account for 24% of the total disturbed area. The disturbance regime shift analysis finds that although human-directed disturbances are now declining in frequency, wild disturbance frequencies are increasing at an accelerated pace. The patch size of human-directed disturbances is shrinking, while the wild disturbance patch size shows both expanding and contracting trends. Disturbance severity is rising across most of the USA. Our findings highlight an urgent need to understand and adapt to these diverging disturbance trajectories, as they will profoundly shape the future of US landscapes.

 Genetic mutations cause hereditary deafness, in which mutations in the POU4 transcription factor 3 gene (POU4F3) lead to autosomal dominant non-syndromic deafness 15 (DFNA15), for which no effective clinical treatment currently exists.

 AI scientists powered by large language models have demonstrated substantial promise in autonomously conducting experiments and facilitating scientific discoveries across various disciplines. While their capabilities are promising, these agents also introduce novel vulnerabilities that require careful consideration for safety. However, there has been limited comprehensive exploration of these vulnerabilities. This perspective examines vulnerabilities in AI scientists, shedding light on potential risks associated with their misuse, and emphasizing the need for safety measures.

Then, we explore the underlying causes of these vulnerabilities and provide a scoping review of the limited existing works. Based on our analysis, we propose a triadic framework involving human regulation, agent alignment, and an understanding of environmental feedback (agent regulation) to mitigate these identified risks.

 Gonorrhoea is a prevalent sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterial pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae. N. gonorrhoeae has demonstrated a remarkable capacity to evolve antibiotic resistance, with emerging strains that show resistance to all standard treatment options. The development of new antibiotics for gonorrhoea, especially those with novel targets and no pre-existing resistance, is critical. One such untapped antibacterial target in N. gonorrhoeae is FabI, an enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase enzyme that is essential for fatty acid biosynthesis in this pathogen. In the current report, structure-based drug design using novel N. gonorrhoeae FabI inhibitor co-crystals guides medicinal chemistry toward increasing potency in the sub-nanomolar range and drives the discovery of Debio 1453. Debio 1453 is optimized for activity against N. gonorrhoeae and is highly active in vitro against diverse N. gonorrhoeae isolates including those resistant to the last remaining treatment options. Additionally, the compound presents a low propensity for selection of mutants with reduced susceptibility. Debio 1453 is efficacious in vivo against N. gonorrhoeae isolates with clinically relevant multi-drug resistance phenotypes in a murine vaginal gonorrhoea infection model underscoring Debio 1453 as a promising candidate for the treatment of gonorrhoea.

 Mammals tightly regulate their core body temperature, yet how cells sense and respond to small temperature changes remains incompletely understood. Here, we discover RNA G-quadruplexes (rG4s) as key thermosensors enriched near splice sites of cold-repressed exons. These thermosensing RNA structures, when stabilized, mask splice sites, reducing exon inclusion. Specifically, rG4s near splice sites of a cold-repressed poison exon in the neuroprotective RBM3 are stabilized at low temperatures, leading to exon exclusion. This enables evasion of nonsense-mediated decay, increasing RBM3 expression at cold. Importantly, stabilizing rG4 through increasing intracellular potassium with an FDA-approved potassium channel blocker, mimics the hypothermic effect on alternative splicing, thereby increasing RBM3 expression, leading to RBM3-dependent neuroprotection in a mouse model of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Our findings unveil a mechanism how mammalian RNAs directly sense temperature and potassium perturbations, integrating them into gene expression programs. This opens new avenues for treating diseases arising from splicing defects and disorders benefiting from therapeutic hypothermia, especially hemorrhagic stroke.

 Climate change has large economic costs for society. An important effect is the disruption of natural resource supply by climate-mediated disturbances such as wildfires, pest outbreaks and storms.

By altering biogeochemical cycles, global plastic pollution may substantially impact the ability of the ocean to absorb and store carbon in the coming decades. 
 Increasing plastic waste has triggered global concerns for the potential detrimental effects on marine ecosystems. The impact of plastic reaches beyond the immediate harm to marine life to encompass the marine biogeochemical cycle and the global carbon budget. We investigate these effects by integrating an oceanic plastic simulation with a marine ecosystem model. We find that oceanic plastic could disturb the marine carbon cycle through three pathways: the plastic carbon buried in sediments, the release of dissolved organic carbon from water-column plastic and the toxicity effect on marine phytoplankton. Our scenario analysis suggests that there are 0.70 (0.13–3.8) Tg of plastics entering the ocean every year, however, the overall impact of oceanic plastics on decreasing ocean carbon uptake could reach 12.1 TgC yr−1. Our model predicts that the global plastic released into the ocean could result in up to 1.6 PgC of lost ocean carbon uptake and storage by 2050, given the foreseeable growth of plastic production and its long-lasting impacts. We urge comprehensive control policies to mitigate the losses caused by marine plastics both in ecosystem integrity and addressing climate change.

 Global water scarcity motivates sustainable clean water production from non-traditional water sources. While existing reverse osmosis (RO) membranes dominate seawater desalination, they are far from ideal for purifying diverse water sources due to inadequate removal of various low-molecular-weight contaminants. Here we overcome this limitation by developing ultraselective polyamide RO membranes via in situ interfacial plasmonic nanoheating integrated interfacial polymerization (IP). The rapid localized heating at the nano-interface of IP boosts the reactivity of monomers, improves the local mass transfer of amine monomers, and facilitates interfacial degassing/vaporization. Consequently, the resultant RO membrane, featuring highly crosslinked polyamide with extensive internal nanovoids, exhibits superior removal for a wide spectrum of toxic and hard-to-remove contaminants found in different water sources, revealing transformative potential for various water treatment scenarios. It also shows a transcendent desalination performance (water permeance of 3.4 l m−2 h−1 bar−1 and NaCl rejection of 99.7%), which further enables efficient desalination of natural seawater for high-quality freshwater, indicating great promise for practical applications.

This study quantifies the extent of global road effect zones, where ecological and environmental conditions are likely to be affected by road traffic, over the past few decades. 
 Road traffic outside of cities (that is, extra-urban road traffic) contributes to ecological and environmental degradation, but the global extent of the ecological impact of extra-urban road traffic is unknown. Using global time-series data on traffic volumes, we generated high-resolution traffic exposure maps that enabled us to estimate road effect zones in which ecological and environmental conditions are likely to be influenced by road traffic. We estimate that the extent of the global terrestrial land influenced by moderate to very high extra-urban road traffic increased by 53% since 1975, reaching 239 million hectares in 2015. Large extents of Europe and North America have been impacted by road traffic since 1975, while the impacted area in large parts of Asia grew rapidly. Alarmingly, 63% of key biodiversity areas were impacted by moderate to very high traffic, with the expansion of road effect zones in these areas outpacing regional rates. Of all land uses, agricultural land was most affected by road traffic. As extra-urban road effect zones are considerably more extensive than urban areas, the ecological and environmental impacts of road traffic are of global concern. Roads traversing agricultural and natural areas outside of city boundaries can have detrimental ecological effects. This study quantifies the extent of global road effect zones, where ecological and environmental conditions are likely to be affected by road traffic, over the past few decades."

 Amber, a fossilised resin, became widespread during the Barremian ( ~ 122 Ma), marking the onset of the Cretaceous Resinous Interval (125–72 Ma). While common in the Northern Hemisphere, amber containing terrestrial arthropod inclusions had not previously been reported from the Mesozoic of South America. Here, we report the major occurrence of such amber from the early Albian ( ~ 112 Ma) Hollín Formation in Ecuadorian Napo region. Discovered at the Genoveva quarry, the amber is associated with coeval pollen and plant macrofossils deposited in fluvio-lacustrine environments. Geochemical analyses suggest araucariacean trees as the resin source, while palynological and macrofloral data indicate moderately diverse forests and the earliest known angiosperm leaf assemblage from north-western South America. Arthropods (hexapods and arachnids) representing at least six orders are well preserved. These findings provide direct evidence of a humid, resinous forest ecosystem and its arthropod fauna in equatorial Gondwana during the Cretaceous Resinous Interval.

 The economy and the financial system, through its exposures to companies, have a dual relationship with nature. They do not only depend on it, but they can also affect it and be affected. This can give rise to nature-related risks, driven by the nature degradation, encompassing the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. We demonstrate how the economy and banks in the euro area are critically dependent on ecosystem services and how they simultaneously contribute to biodiversity loss through their biodiversity footprint. In our sample, 72% of the analysed companies in the euro area exhibit a high dependency on at least one ecosystem service. Out of the 2500 banks analyzed, 100 are responsible, through their loans to companies, for 87% of the total biodiversity footprint of the euro area banking system. Degradation of ecosystems and biodiversity loss can pose risks to the financial system by affecting companies’ production processes and, consequently, impairing their ability to repay debt. Such nature-related risks can be exacerbated by climate change. Our analysis reveals that nearly 60% of loans in the euro area are exposed to companies facing unmet flood protection needs, highlighting the compound financial risks from multiple, interacting ecosystem and climate hazards.

 Microbialites are organosedimentary structures that have existed since the Precambrian and have endured through geological time, serving as archives of Earth’s environmental evolution. Today, they persist in only a few environments markedly different from those in which they first arose. Here, we report a modern microbialite reef in Laguna Pozo Bravo (Puna region, Argentina), exposed to high radiation, low oxygen pressure, and volcanic inputs reminiscent of early Earth. Through physicochemical, mineralogical, spectroscopic, electron microscopy, and metagenomic analyses, we identified diverse microbial communities with metabolic capacities that induce mineralisation. Seasonal environmental fluctuations drive cyclical changes in community composition, producing potential mineralisation patterns. Our findings suggest that carbon fixation and the metabolic drivers of alkalinity in microbialites may have evolved over time. Moreover, the variability in prokaryotic compositions among modern microbialites demonstrates that carbonate precipitation is governed by metabolic potential rather than taxonomy, reinforcing their role as dynamic records of environmental conditions.

 Groundwater is a critical resource for supporting Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in arid and semi-arid regions, such as the Mongolian Plateau (MP), which accounts for over 82 % of total water usage in Mongolia; however, its spatiotemporal dynamics remain underexplored. In this study, aiming to enhance the connection between the Groundwater Storage (GWS) and local SDG implementation, we established an integrated analytical framework encompassing groundwater change detection, driving force analysis, and groundwater sustainability assessment. This framework quantifies groundwater storage changes across the MP from April 2002 to December 2023. Results reveal an overall groundwater change rate of −2.96 mm/yr in the MP, which increases in the west and north and decreases in the east, center, and south. The Gobi area has shown increase trends in GWS. Attribution analysis reveals that areas with increasing GWS are more influenced by climatic conditions such as higher precipitation and lower evapotranspiration, while regions with significantly decreasing GWS are associated with insufficient natural recharge and stronger human activity intensity. By contrast, winter precipitation recharge played a crucial role in slowing down the decrease in groundwater storage. In the five major basins of the MP, the dominant factors leading to groundwater depletion varied and were driven by various social factors, such as population, livestock, agriculture, and mining. A dual-index classification combining precipitation minus evapotranspiration (P−ET) and GWS trends provides a convenient, interpretable and objective approach to assessing groundwater sustainability, offering strong correspondence with the Reliability–Resilience–Vulnerability (RRV) framework. This combined strategy not only captures groundwater trends but also enhances interpretability by linking local sustainability levels to both environmental and anthropogenic drivers, underscoring the need for targeted management to support SDG 6.6. The findings of the present study provide an accurate assessment framework and valuable scientific evidence for groundwater resource management in arid and semi-arid regions."

 Sand ripples, shaped by fluid flow like wind or water, are common on dunes on Earth and Mars. Their patterns reveal local transport conditions, offering insights into wind regimes where direct observations are lacking. Since manual mapping is slow and subjective, automated methods are essential for consistent large-scale analysis. This study presents two novel and complementary methods for mapping ripple patterns on Martian dunes using high-resolution imagery: a U-Net model for pattern classification and a 2D semi-variogram for measuring ripple spacing and orientation. Tested on 42 barchan dunes across six Martian regions, the U-Net showed reliable ripple classification (F1-score 79 %), while the variogram method achieved high accuracy for ripple spacing (R2 = 0.78) and orientation (R2 = 0.98).

 Highly efficient and reliable monitoring of coral reef ecosystems is imperative for effective conservation and management under increasing anthropogenic and climatic pressures. However, current survey techniques either offer limited coverage and low efficiency or incur substantial manual costs for data processing. In this study, we propose a highly efficient towed optical camera array system, Speedy Sea Scanner version 2.0 (SSSv2), with an advanced electrical system supporting a stable power supply, reliable communications, and underwater illumination, which enables continuous video data collection and real-time monitoring. We also develop a semantic segmentation model, Coral-Lab, with high accuracy and robustness in coral identification task, which enables fully automated coral reef identification and coral coverage calculation. Coral-Lab model achieved an F-score of 0.802 and an mIoU of 0.665 on our test set. Leveraging SSSv2, we conducted field surveys off the northern coast of Kumejima Island, Okinawa, Japan, on July 14, 2024 and July 15, 2024 across seven sampling areas comprising 29 transect lines. Over two days survey, we collected video data covering a total seafloor area of 47,950 m2, which was converted into a georeferenced orthomosaic at an average spatial resolution of 2.5 mm via Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) techniques. This approach achieved an effective survey efficiency of approximately 7200 m2 per hour.

 Mountains provide vital ecosystem services that support the livelihoods of billions of people worldwide, playing a crucial role in biodiversity conservation and climate regulation. The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has established a specific target (SDG 15.4) dedicated to mountain protection. The Mountain Green Cover Index (MGCI) serves as a key indicator for assessing the health of mountain ecosystems. As the 2030 Agenda passes its midpoint, the mid-term assessment of the MGCI is essential for adjusting implementation strategies and ensuring the realization of the 2030 Agenda for the protection of mountain ecosystems. However, existing country-level MGCI values fail to account for the three-dimensional characteristics unique to mountains. Additionally, quantifying the detailed mechanisms of change and dynamics in highly heterogeneous mountain areas within countries remains challenging. In this study, we developed a high-resolution grid-based MGCI model for China and estimated MGCI values from 2000 to 2022 using 30 m annual land cover data and the true surface area of mountains. We analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of the MGCI and quantified the impacts of anthropogenic and natural factors on MGCI dynamics during the 2022 mid-term assessment. The results show that from 2000 to 2022, China’s overall MGCI increased from 78.15 % to 82.23 %, with an average annual growth rate of 0.18 %. Notably, 8.48 % of mountains experienced an MGCI increase within the (0, 0.5) range, while only 0.03 % of areas saw a decrease greater than 0.5, primarily concentrated on the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau. Spatial pattern analysis revealed clear variations in MGCI along elevation and hydrothermal gradients. Driving factor analysis indicated that water-related variables explain MGCI spatial distribution more effectively than thermal conditions. Furthermore, the interaction between grazing intensity and water factors demonstrated a strong synergistic effect on MGCI distribution. This research enhances the understanding of MGCI dynamics and its driving factors in China’s mountain ecosystems, offering valuable reference for the timely achievement of mountain sustainable development goals."

 The high PM2.5 concentrations significantly influence the air quality in the Maritime Continent region, especially in Peninsular Malaysia (PMY), which is affected by the annual burning season. However, the 2019 pollution case is unique due to the presence of a positive Indian Ocean dipole (pIOD) with a weak El Niño, which influenced the transport of pollutants toward PMY. This work aims to evaluate the ability of the numerical chemical weather prediction model (WRF-CMAQ) by performing a sensitivity analysis to reproduce the air quality during this event. Two model settings were studied: weather nudging and the burning emission amount of the fire inventory from NCAR (FINN). Three cases were established: 1) WRF-CMAQw (without nudging setting and with original fire emission), 2) WRF-CMAQn (with nudging setting and with original fire emission), and 3) WRF-CMAQa (with nudging setting and adjusted fire emission) to predict the PM2.5 concentration in PMY during the 2019 transboundary smoke event. The weather (temperature and wind profile) simulation results showed that WRF-CMAQa and WRF-CMAQn agreed up about 95 % and WRF-CMAQw agreed up to 93 % when compared with ground weather stations based on the statistical evaluation of correlation coefficient, bias, and error measures. For air quality, overall, WRF-CMAQa (87.23 %) demonstrated better performance compared to WRF-CMAQw (62.41 %) and WRF-CMAQn (78.72 %) in predicting the ground PM2.5. However, the diurnal prediction during the transboundary smoke event remains weak. For O3 concentration, the model performance agreement was quite low for all simulations. However, WRF-CMAQa could predict about 44.76 % compared to WRF-CMAQn (26.66 %) and WRF-CMAQw (41.90 %) in overall model performance, and all simulations managed to capture the diurnal trend of O3 when compared with ground observation station data. In conclusion, the sensitivity study on the weather and chemical prediction model, especially WRF-CMAQ, could help improve the air quality prediction system in PMY during the recurrence of transboundary smoke events."

10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108483,False,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文主要关注的是北太平洋涛动（NPO）对西北太平洋热带气旋（TC）的影响，特别是NPO的空间格局变化如何影响NPO与TC之间的关系。研究发现，大约在2004/2005年，这种关系经历了年代际变化，从正相关转为负相关。论文探讨了NPO如何通过影响海面温度（SST）来调节TC的生成。虽然该研究涉及大气环流和气候变化，但它与大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析，没有直接的强相关性。,"['North Pacific Oscillation', 'Tropical Cyclone', 'Sea Surface Temperature', 'Climate Change']",Chixiang Lin;Zeming Wu;Chundi Hu,Impact transition of spring North Pacific Oscillation on the Northwest Pacific tropical cyclone during autumn,"•Relationship between spring NPO and autumn WNP TCG reversed around 2004. •NPO-TCG relationship was positive prior to 2004, but shifted to negative afterward. •WNP SST anomalies maintain the spring NPO signal through autumn to modulate TC. •Prior to 2004, NPO induced cooling SST in WNP to suppress TCG. •NPO south lobe extends northwestward after 2004, inducing warming SST to promote TCG. 
 The North Pacific Oscillation (NPO) is the second dominant mode in the Northern Pacific sea-level pressure, exerting significant influences on the tropical cyclone (TC) over the western North Pacific (WNP). While studies show that the spatial pattern of NPO has undergone interdecadal changes, the impact of these changes on the NPO-TC relationship is unclear. Here we reveal that this relationship experienced an interdecadal shift from positive to negative correlation around 2004/2005. During the earlier period (1986–2004), the NPO induced a persistent cold pool over the WNP, which promoted northerly winds, enhancing subsidence and reduced relative humidity to suppress TC genesis. In contrast, during the later period (2005–2023), the southern lobe of the NPO extended northwestward, which led to the development of a localized warm pool over the subtropical WNP. The expanding warm pool persisted into autumn and contributed to a cyclonic circulation centered over the Philippines Sea, which enhanced upward motion and moisture convergence to promote TC genesis. Our findings provide important insights into the mechanisms driving interdecadal variability in TC activity and highlight the role of springtime NPO in improving seasonal prediction models under ongoing climate change."
