10.1029/2024GL112491,False,Geophysical Research Letters,这篇论文研究的是湿地和旱地土壤中结合态有机碳的长期稳定机制。研究使用了13C和14C同位素技术，分析了结合态有机碳的来源、周转以及金属（氢氧化物）对其稳定性的影响。研究发现，在湿地土壤中，结合态有机碳的保存程度相对更好，这与传统认识不同。该研究主要关注土壤碳循环过程，与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等，关系不大。,[],Tian Ma;Yiyun Wang;Guohua Dai;Juan Jia;Zongguang Liu;Yufu Jia;Simin Wang;Erxiong Zhu;Xinying Zhang;Negar Haghipour;Lukas Wacker;Bingrui Jia;Jin‐Sheng He;Hailong Zhang;Meixun Zhao;Timothy I.

However, the source and turnover of (metal‐) bound organic carbon (OC) in soils are poorly constrained. Here we present the first large‐scale study on the 13C and 14C characteristics of bound OC in 15 wetland and upland soil profiles. We find that bound OC has similar δ13C as SOC, suggesting no preference for plant‐ or microbe‐derived carbon. However, bound OC Δ14C is more negative than SOC in wetland but not upland mineral soils, and decreases with increasing reactive minerals. Hence, in contrast to the conventional assumption, bound OC is better preserved relative to SOC in wetlands with high contents of reactive metals. Our finding highlights the dynamic exchange of bound OC with SOC in upland soils and calls for a better recognition of reactive metals in stabilizing OC in wetlands."

This campaign was instigated to assess the feasibility of obtaining continuous daily measurements for the long term (over a period of more than 1 month), to distribute the data in a format designated for numerical weather prediction, and to evaluate data quality compared to conventional meteorological data. Three types of uncrewed aircraft systems were utilized, that is, a meteorological medium‐sized hexacopter and medium‐ and small‐sized commercial drones with meteorological sensors attached. The maximum flight height was limited to 900 m above ground level owing to airspace regulations around the observation site. Compared with routine radiosonde data, the bias of air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed measurements was less than 0.3 K, 1.5%, and 0.6 m s−1 ${\mathrm{s}}^{-1}$, respectively, thereby meeting WMO requirements. Moreover, data transfer to the WMO‐prepared repository was completed within 30 min after measurement acquisition. Based on user experience, several aspects regarding the UAS‐DC campaign were discussed from the perspective of sustainable operation and atmospheric boundary layer research."

These organics adsorbed at the air‐water interface can interact with the atmospheric oxidants and influence the exchange of organic materials between the water and the atmosphere. Here, we assess the chemical interaction between gaseous NO2 and authentic surface microlayers collected at the lake water (Dianchi Lake) situated in China. The formation of the gas‐phase product compounds was evaluated in real time using a novel secondary electrospray ionization ultrahigh‐resolution quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometer (SESI‐UHR‐MS) upon exposure of surface microlayer to gaseous NO2 (20 or 50 ppb) in dark and under simulated sunlight irradiation at two different temperatures: 5°C and 25°C. The obtained results revealed that the sampling sites of the lake impacted by human activities (municipal sewage and agricultural activities) significantly impact the number and the composition of the formed gas‐phase product compounds. The formation of nitrogen (N)‐containing compounds was observed as well, which contain most likely nitro or amino functional groups, or alternatively, they could be aromatic compounds. The observed N‐containing compounds may contribute to the “brown carbon” which act as light‐absorbing compounds, thus influencing the radiative forcing of aerosols in the atmosphere."

 Asia is one of the largest dust source regions in the world. However, the temporal variations and drivers of different types of dust events in this region remain unclear. Based on surface observation data, we explored spatiotemporal changes in three types of dust events and their driving factors in Asia by using machine learning methods. Results indicated that the frequency of moderate dust events (MDE) and severe dust events (SDE) decreased significantly from 2000 to 2022, which could be primarily attributed to a decrease in strong wind days (contribution >50%), and to a lesser extent to increases in soil moisture, precipitation, and leaf area index (LAI). When the daily maximum wind speed exceeds 13.0 m/s, the probability of MDE tends to decrease, while the probability of SDE tends to increase. These findings enhance our understanding of the variation in frequency and intensity of dust events in response to climate change."

 Characterizing deep subsurface microbial communities informs our understanding of Earth’s biogeochemistry as well as the search for life beyond the Earth. Here we characterized microbial communities within the Kidd Creek Observatory subsurface fracture water system with mean residence times of hundreds of millions to over one billion years. 16S rRNA analysis revealed that biosamplers well isolated from the mine environment were dominated by a putatively anaerobic and halophilic bacterial species from the Halobacteroidaceae family, Candidatus Frackibacter. Contrastingly, biosamplers and biofilms exposed to the mine environment contained aerobic Sphingomonas taxa. δ13C values of phospholipid fatty acids and putative functional predictions derived from 16S rRNA gene profiles, imply Candidatus Frackibacter may use carbon derived from ancient carbon-rich layers common in these systems. These results indicate that Candidatus Frackibacter is not unique to hydraulically fracked sedimentary basins but rather may be indigenous to a wide range of deep, saline groundwaters hosted in carbon-rich rocks.

 One debated scenario for the termination of the Messinian salinity crisis 5.33 million years ago is cataclysmic refilling of the Mediterranean Sea through the Zanclean megaflood. Here we present a clear line of onshore-to-offshore evidence for this megaflood spilling over a shallow-water marine corridor in south-east Sicily into the nearby subaqueous Noto Canyon: (i) >300 asymmetric and streamlined erosional ridges aligned with the megaflood direction, (ii) poorly-sorted breccia deposited between the Messinian and Lower Zanclean Trubi Formations, (iii) soft-sediment deformation structures and clastic injections in the breccia and underlying units, and (iv) a 20 kilometre wide erosional shelf channel connecting the ridges with Noto Canyon. Numerical modelling results support the modulation of flow velocity and direction by the excavation of the channel and Noto Canyon. Our findings demonstrate that the Messinian salinity crisis was terminated through a cataclysmic flood, which implies pronounced Mediterranean sea-level drawdown prior to the flooding.

 In the 1970s, US President Richard Nixon offered moon samples returned by the Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 missions to the leaders of the nations of the World. In this study, we used a combination of advanced X-ray analysis methods, including microtomography, tomosynthesis and hyperspectral chemical mapping to carry out a non-destructive forensic investigation of the Dutch Apollo 11 Goodwill sample, normally on display at the Boerhaave museum in the Netherlands. These powerful methods were uniquely able to non-destructively interrogate the samples encased in plastic without contact, providing 3D images of sample textures and compositional analysis, to assess whether the results agree with archive data on Apollo 11 coarse-grained soil sample number 10085, and to provide new insights on their origins. Our forensic investigation asked the question: were the rocks in the Dutch display actually picked up on the surface of the moon by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin?

 The retrieval of wheat green leaf area index (LAIG) from satellite imagery is critical for monitoring crop growth and assessing food security. Numerous vegetation indices (VIs) derived from spectral reflectance have been widely used to estimate LAIG. In particular, red edge VIs can mitigate the confounding effect of multiple factors, such as the soil background and leaf inclination angle variation, and typically are highly correlated with LAIG. However, their relationship to LAIG tends to be affected by variations in leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), because the position of the red edge of vegetation spectra shifts with changes in LCC. This issue directly limits the operational use of VI-LAIG models, especially those employing red-edge bands. Therefore, to reduce the sensitivity of VI-LAIG relationships to LCC variation, this study proposed an innovative approach, called the Difference Combination between Spectral Indices (DCSI). Using synthetic data simulated with the PROSAIL radiative transfer model, we tested the dependence of the algebraic difference between common VIs on LCC. The results show that many combinations of VIs are insensitive to LCC variation. The newly developed DCSI combination between the Sentinel-2 red edge position (S2REP) and B6-red edge band (RE2) (i.e., DCSI(S2REP&RE2)), produces the most accurate LAIG model when LCC varies. We also modified the constant of this DCSI combination, to develop the Sentinel-2 modified red edge position (S2MREP) for LAIG retrievals. In comparison to traditional VI-LAIG models, the S2MREP-LAIG model has higher accuracy, with Rcal2 of 0.76 in calibration, and in validation Rval2 of 0.72 and RRMSE of 23.61 %. In addition, the S2MREP-LAIG model (RRMSE=28.64 %) also outperforms the existing Sentinel-2 LAI product (RRMSE=38.20 %) in the retrieval of wheat LAIG. In summary, the proposed DCSI approach and S2MREP effectively mitigate the impact of LCC variations on LAIG retrievals, thus facilitating the large-scale retrieval of LAIG and the spatial mapping of wheat LAIG."

 Existing remote sensing applications in mining are often of limited scope, typically mapping multiple mining land covers for a single mine or only mapping mining extents or a single feature (e.g., tailings dam) for multiple mines across a region. Many of these works have a narrow focus on specific mine land covers rather than encompassing the variety of mining and non-mining land use in a mine site. This study presents a pioneering effort in performing deep learning-based semantic segmentation of 37 mining locations worldwide, representing a range of commodities from gold to coal, using multispectral satellite imagery, to automate mapping of mining and non-mining land covers. Due to the absence of a dedicated training dataset, we crafted a customized multispectral dataset for training and testing deep learning models, leveraging and refining existing datasets in terms of boundaries, shapes, and class labels. We trained and tested multimodal semantic segmentation models, particularly based on U-Net, DeepLabV3+, Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), SegFormer, and IBM-NASA foundational geospatial model (Prithvi) architecture, with a focus on evaluating different model configurations, input band combinations, and the effectiveness of transfer learning. In terms of multimodality, we utilized various image bands, including Red, Green, Blue, and Near Infra-Red (NIR) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), to determine which combination of inputs yields the most accurate segmentation. Results indicated that among different configurations, FPN with DenseNet-121 backbone, pre-trained on ImageNet, and trained using both RGB and NIR bands, performs the best. We concluded the study with a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance based on climate classification categories and diverse mining commodities. We believe that this work lays a robust foundation for further analysis of the complex relationship between mining projects, communities, and the environment."

 Supervised classification methods can distinguish between noise and signal in ice, cloud, and land elevation satellite-2 (ICESat-2) data across various feature perspectives and autonomously optimize parameters. Nevertheless, model generalization remains a significant limitation for practical applications. This study focuses on developing a universal denoising model for ICESat-2 using machine learning algorithms and analyzing its spatial transferability under various forest and terrain conditions. A photon-denoising feature parameter system is developed based on the analysis of the three-dimensional distribution of photons in forested regions. This system reduces the parameters dependent on absolute physical quantities and increases those that are less influenced by terrain and forest features to enhance the model’s transferability. Subsequently, automated machine learning algorithms (AutoML) are used for model selection and parameter optimization across six non-parametric regression models. We evaluate the accuracies of the local, global, and transfer models in estimating canopy height across four representative forested areas in China. Results show that the algorithm can effectively distinguish between signal and noise photons. The estimated canopy heights from signal photons are highly consistent with heights obtained using airborne laser scanning (ALS), exhibiting a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.89, root mean square errors (RMSE) of 3.75 m, relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of 0.27, relative bias (rBias) of −0.11 and mean Bias of −1.45 m. Notably, the accuracy of canopy height estimation by the global model has increased by an average of 21 % compared to ICESat-2 land-vegetation along-track products (ATL08). Furthermore, the model exhibits significant spatial transfer capabilities, with the accuracies of the transfer model exceeding those of ATL08 by margins ranging from 4 % to 41 %. This study marks a significant advancement in photon-denoising methodologies, providing a robust and transferable solution for large-scale environmental data analysis."

 Economic impact estimates of the initial lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic showed a significant reduction in economic activities globally. However, the succeeding impacts and their spatiotemporal distribution within countries remain unknown. Studies showed that nighttime light data (NTL) has effectively revealed the spatiotemporal dimensions of the economic effects of COVID-19. Thus, this study used NTL data to determine the medium-term regional monthly economic impacts of the pandemic in the Philippines in terms of the Economic Activity Reduction (EAR) index. We generated a spatial error model, regressing pre-pandemic NTL on mean temperature, maximum rainfall, and built-up area. This model explained 81.6% of the pre-pandemic NTL and was used to estimate the counterfactual NTL. We subtracted the actual from the counterfactual to compute the EAR. Then, the EAR was regressed on regional factors to determine which ones influence the impacts. Results showed uneven distribution of EAR across space and time. The EAR was generally higher in urban regions than in rural ones. Overall, more regions in the south had higher EAR. Temporally, the EAR showed a dynamic pattern, increasing in less urban regions and decreasing in highly urbanized regions. Regional analysis showed that urbanization level, population density, and poverty incidence had a significant positive relationship with the EAR.

The severity of these disasters can be assessed through remote sensing techniques, specifically using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for measurement. However, NDVI observations using optical sensors are often affected by cloud and fog in areas with numerous water bodies, such as Taihu Lake. Sensors operating in the microwave band can effectively mitigate this issue, particularly the emerging Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R), which offers high temporal resolution and cost-effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a new method to recover lake-surface NDVI on cloudy days, utilizing GNSS-R observables and auxiliary meteorological data in conjunction with a machine learning regression algorithm called Bagging Tree. We also examine the effective range of GNSS-R data within this application scenario. Meanwhile, the Weighted Linear Regression-Laplacian Prior Regulation Method (WLR-LPRM) image gap-filling algorithm is used as a benchmark to evaluate recovery accuracy. The regression coefficient of NDVI retrieved using the proposed method is 0.95, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.021 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.010. Compared to the previous work on GNSS-R algal bloom detection with overall accuracy of 0.82, this work shows significant improvement in both accuracy and utility. The recovery of lake surface NDVI provides detailed insights into algal blooms, including quantifiable metrics such as the amount and spatial distribution, which are crucial for effective monitoring and management. Additionally, the recovered image textures exhibit high clarity and closely resemble the reference NDVI images. Experimental evaluation using simulated and actual cloud blocks indicates the model’s robustness to recover NDVI under varying cloud cover conditions. In summary, this study demonstrates the capability of GNSS-R aided by supplementary data for recovering missing NDVI values on lake surfaces when optical observations are absent for the first time."

10.1016/j.atmosenv.2024.121019,False,Atmospheric Environment,这篇论文主要研究了黄渤海海域大气颗粒态汞的时空分布、形态和潜在来源。它通过采集总悬浮颗粒物样品，分析了黄渤海海域颗粒态汞的浓度水平、形态特征和潜在来源，结果表明，煤炭燃烧和海洋来源是黄渤海海域颗粒态汞的主要来源，冬季和夏季的污染物传输路径有所不同，干沉降是黄渤海海域汞的重要来源。研究中使用了地面观测数据，并未涉及到大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等。因此，这篇论文与大气环境遥感技术的相关性较弱。,"['Particulate mercury', 'Atmospheric mercury', 'Air quality', 'Dry deposition', 'Coal combustion', 'Marine sources', 'Yellow and Bohai Seas']",Bing Mo;Yan Wang;Xixi Chong;Ruhai Liu;Wen Zheng;Xuyuan Zhou;Dongting Li;Xue Ding;Xianxiang Luo;Fengmin Li,"Spatial and temporal distribution, species, and potential source analysis of atmospheric particulate mercury in the Yellow and Bohai seas","•Distribution and species of total particulate mercury (TPM) in the Yellow and Bohai Seas (YBS) were discussed. •Coal combustion and marine sources were the primary sources of TPM in the YBS in winter and summer. •The generation of volatile particulate mercury and reactive particulate mercury was closely related to secondary aerosols. •Dry deposition of TPM was an important source of mercury in the YBS region. 
 The distribution characteristics of total particulate mercury (TPM), as well as the species of mercury in particulate matter in the winter and summer in the Yellow and Bohai Seas (YBS), were not well understood. Total suspended particulate matter (TSP) samples were collected to determine the concentration level, species characteristics, and potential sources of TPM in the YBS. The annual average TPM concentration in the YBS was 40.4 ± 30.1 pg/m3, and the seasonal variation of TPM followed the order of spring (63.3 ± 26.8 pg/m3), winter (49.6 ± 21.8 pg/m3) and summer (12.7 ± 11.3 pg/m3). The average TPM concentration of the Bohai Sea and the North Yellow Sea (NYS) was higher than that in the South Yellow Sea (SYS). The average concentrations of volatile particulate mercury (VPM) and reactive particulate mercury (RPM) were 0.07 pg/m3 and 0.40 pg/m3, respectively. RPM/TPM exhibited the highest levels in the SYS during the winter and summer seasons. Polluted air masses from northern China in winter, southern China (such as Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions) in spring, eastern coastal provinces of China, and parts of Japan and South Korea in summer were identified as significant sources of TPM in the YBS. Coal combustion accounted for 77.4% of the total TPM emissions, which was the main source of TPM in the YBS. Secondary aerosol played an important role in the transformation of particulate mercury species. The total annual dry deposition of TPM in the YBS was estimated to be 11.6 t/yr, highlighting the significant role of dry deposition as a source of mercury in the YBS."
None,True,Atmospheric Environment,这篇论文研究了HCFOs（氢氯氟烃）臭氧分解反应生成CF3H的机制，特别是关注了E-和Z-CF3CH=CHCl两种异构体的差异。这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为HCFOs和CF3H都是重要的温室气体和大气痕量成分，它们在大气中的浓度变化会影响全球气候变化和臭氧层破坏。研究HCFOs臭氧分解反应的产物，有助于我们更准确地评估HCFOs对大气环境的影响，并改进大气化学模型。通过卫星遥感技术，特别是利用FTIR（傅里叶变换红外光谱）等技术，可以监测大气中HCFOs和CF3H的浓度分布，从而为大气环境监测和气候变化研究提供重要的数据支持。因此，这项研究对于提高大气成分分析的准确性和完善大气环境遥感技术具有重要意义。,"['Atmospheric composition', 'Halocarbons', 'Air quality', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'FTIR', 'Ozone']",O.J.

10.1016/j.atmosres.2024.107891,True,Atmospheric Research,这项研究使用WRF模式的敏感性实验，探究了热带气旋（TC）可能产生的过量云冰对西太平洋副热带高压（WPSH）的热力学反馈效应，以及对TC路径的影响。研究发现，TC路径北侧的过量云冰可以通过对流层上层（下层）水凝物的潜热释放（融化和蒸发导致的冷却）改变当地的温度和位势高度，并伴随加强的当地下沉气流。这改变了引导气流，导致TC提前转向北方。敏感性实验和对一些转向北方的TC的观测结果证实了高空水凝物的热力学反馈效应对TC路径的影响。 这项研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它利用了对云冰和水凝物等大气成分的观测（例如，可能用到卫星观测数据来验证模型结果），并将其应用于改进热带气旋路径预测。,"['cloud ice', 'hydrometeors', 'tropical cyclone track prediction', 'geopotential height', 'temperature', 'satellite observations', 'numerical weather prediction']",Zongbao Bai;Zhong Zhong;Yuan Sun;Yunying Li,Effect of the thermodynamic feedback of tropical cyclones on the subtropical high,"•The excess cloud ice possibly origins from tropical cyclones can feedback on the western Pacific subtropical high via thermodynamical process •Ensemble numerical experiments address that excess cloud ice can cause tropical cyclone Megi (2010) to turn northwards ahead of time •Excess cloud ice alters the local temperature and geopotential height and induces a low-pressure system over the sensitivity region •Observations validate that hydrometeors will increase to the north of origin west-bounding track before turning •Hydrometeors have potential value in predicting sudden turning tropical cyclone tracks 
 In this study, the thermodynamic feedback effect of excess cloud ice possibly originating from tropical cyclones (TCs) on the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) and, in turn, the TC track was investigated by use of sensitivity experiments with the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model. The results indicated that excess cloud ice in the area north of the TC track can alter the temperature and the geopotential height there via latent heat release (cooling due to melting and evaporation) of hydrometeors in the upper (lower) troposphere, accompanying by the enhanced local downdrafts. Moreover, under the influence of the changed steering flow, the TC turns northward ahead of time relative to its original track. The sensitivity experiments confirm that the thermodynamic feedback effect of hydrometeors aloft can ultimately affect the TC track, which is also supported by observations of some selected northward-turning TCs."
