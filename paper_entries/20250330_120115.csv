Linden,Systematic Review of Microorganism Removal Performance by Physiochemical Water Treatment Technologies,"Access to safe drinking water is crucial for public health necessitating the use of effective water treatment processes. We conducted a systematic literature review on microorganism removal by physical treatment processes used in drinking water treatment systems with the aim of providing current summary data to update the World Health Organization’s Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality (GDWQ) and to reflect on the data available for comparison of treatment technologies. We reviewed peer-reviewed articles reporting original data that were published between 1997 and March 2022 on the following physical treatment technologies: roughing filters, storage reservoirs, bank filtration, conventional and high-rate clarification, dissolved air flotation, lime softening, granular media filtration, slow sand filtration, precoat filtration, membrane filtration, granular activated carbon, ceramic membrane filtration, and soil aquifer treatment. The literature search was conducted in several databases including Web of Science and PubMed. Data from 165 articles were included in the analysis and used to calculate Log Reduction Values (LRVs) for each technology by microbial contaminant type (bacteria, virus, or protozoa). The quantity and quality of data ranged widely for each technology. We found granular media, membranes (microfiltration (MF), ultrafiltration (UF), and reverse osmosis (RO)), and precoat filtration to remove the most protozoa with average LRVs of 3.0 (95% CI 2.8–3.3), 5.7 (95% CI 5.4–6.0), and 4.4 (95% CI 4.1–4.7), respectively. Bacteria was removed most effectively by membrane filtration (MF, UF, RO) with average LRVs of 4.5 (95% CI 3.9–5.1) and moderately by dissolved air flotation, lime softening, and soil aquifer treatment with average LRVs of 2.7, 2.6, and 2.4 respectively. Viruses were removed most effectively by reverse osmosis membrane filtration with an average LRV of 4.9 (95% CI 4.0–5.7). This data provides valuable information on pathogen reduction and areas of needed research. The variation in results underscores the importance of further consideration when selecting technologies to use and the need for standardized reporting in both lab and field studies. It is important to consider variables in water quality and technology operation that may impact treatment effectiveness when selecting treatment options for use. The findings contribute to ongoing efforts to revise the WHO’s GDWQ, offering updated insights into LRVs for different water treatment technologies."

Although sunlight-induced photoreductive dissolution of ferrihydrite via ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) has been extensively studied, its potential impacts on mineralogical transformation and environmental behaviors of coexisting contaminants remain largely unknown. Here, we systematically investigated the effects of environmental parameters (e.g., solution pH, pO2 level, arsenic speciation, and content) on ferrihydrite transformation with the representative DOM-oxalate under simulated solar irradiation. Results showed that the oxalate-mediated LMCT process synchronously initiated Fe(II) production and proton consumption, the latter of which facilitated interfacial electron transfer and atom exchange (IET-AEFh-Fe2+) processes among ferrihydrite and newly formed Fe(II). At pH 5.0–8.0, ferrihydrite was prone to transform into goethite due to sufficient Fe(II) (approximately 80–2700 μM) from LMCToxa and enough affinity of Fe(II) with mineral to trigger IET-AEFh-Fe2+, while it only underwent reductive dissolution at pH 3.0–5.0 or kept a quasi-steady state over pH 8.0. Increasing the pO2 level and arsenic content hampered the recrystallization of ferrihydrite by reducing Fe(II) duration or altering the surface property of ferrihydrite, whereas the presence of As(III/V) also led to the formation of lepidocrocite with As(V) being more prominent. Additionally, chemical extraction and As K-edge EXAFS spectroscopy revealed that As was consecutively incorporated into the structures of goethite and lepidocrocite in the form of As(V) regardless of primary As speciation. These findings shed novel insights into low-crystalline iron oxide transformation and element migration driven by sunlight in natural environments."

With the objective of devising chemical design strategies, we initially explored the structure–activity relationship (SAR) and structure–toxicity relationship (STR) of isothiazolinones. By comparing the antimicrobial activities of commercial isothiazolinone analogues, chlorine substitutions were identified as key determinants of pathogen growth inhibition potency. The variability of reproductive endocrine-disrupting toxicity was primarily driven by the length of the alkyl carbon chain, based on interactions with molecular initiating events and disturbances in sex hormones. Inspired by the SAR and STR guidelines, two new isothiazolinones (i.e., Target 1 and Target 2) were designed and synthesized. Compared to the commercial analogue dichloro-octylisothiazolinone, Target 1, which has a shorter alkyl chain and the same chlorine count, demonstrated slightly stronger antimicrobial activity, significantly lower endocrine-disrupting toxicity, and longer environmental persistence. Meanwhile, Target 2, containing ether bonds within a shorter alkyl chain and the same chlorine count, exhibited weaker antimicrobial activity, significantly lower endocrine-disrupting toxicity, and slightly longer environmental persistence. Overall, this study proposes a mechanism-driven design strategy for isothiazolinone alternatives that successfully reduces endocrine toxicity while maintaining antimicrobial activity."

However, their long-term application is often limited by the trade-off between catalytic efficiency and durability. In this study, we present a stable monolithic ceramic membrane integrating a CoTiO3/TiO2 interface that successfully overcomes this trade-off. The CoTiO3/TiO2 interface enhances peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation while preventing Co2+ leaching, ensuring both high catalytic efficiency and structural integrity under reactive conditions. Finite element analysis suggests that the optimized distribution of the catalyst across our membrane regulates PMS utilization and minimizes the corrosive effects of radicals, extending the membrane’s lifespan. The synthesized membrane demonstrated exceptional catalytic performance and stability, achieving fast bisphenol A removal (up to 99% within 25 s of reaction time) and maintaining structural integrity during 120 h of prolonged exposure to reactive PMS environments. This membrane design not only overcomes efficiency and durability but also offers a scalable solution for advanced water treatment applications."

Given its stable presence in aquatic environments, long-term exposure of wild fish may pose a risk to offspring embryonic development. This study demonstrated that exposure of zebrafish to environmental concentrations of difenoconazole throughout their life cycle resulted in abnormal development of offspring embryos/larvae, including decreased heart rate, delayed hatching, increased malformation rate, shortened body length, and increased mortality. These changes were significantly correlated with the affected apoptosis, autophagy, energy metabolism and MAPK signaling pathways in F1 generation. This transgenerational toxic effect results from epigenetic alterations in gametes, impaired nutrient supply from the ovum, and maternal transfer of difenoconazole. After exposure to difenoconazole, the development of female fish offspring was affected more than that of male fish offspring, which was mainly caused by the impaired nutrient supply from the ovum and the maternal transfer of difenoconazole. Because this transgenerational developmental toxicity was observed at environmental levels, difenoconazole may pose a threat to the survival of wild larvae and therefore a risk to wild fish populations."

However, to date, the effects of terrestrial organic matter (OM) input and degradation on CH4 emissions from large reservoirs remain largely unknown. From May 2020 to April 2021, we conducted monthly sampling campaigns at 100 sites in Lake Qiandao (580 km2), a mega-reservoir in China, and made monthly vertical profile observations from March to September 2023. We estimated an annual mean FCH4 flux of 0.26 g C m–2 yr–1 (1.51 × 108 g C yr–1). Elevated FCH4 and enriched δ13C-CH4 coincided with low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations, high levels of organic suspended solids, terrestrial organic matter, nutrients, depleted δ18O-H2O, and low carbon isotope fractionation (αC) in the inflowing lake regions. Dissolved CH4 (cCH4) correlated positively to the relative abundance of aliphatic compounds. Anoxic bioincubation experiments revealed rapid degradation of riverine organic matter, accompanied by a 56-fold increase in cCH4, δ13C-CH4 enrichment (to −32.25‰), and a significant decrease in αC to 1.02. These findings indicate that acetoclastic CH4 production makes a substantial contribution to cCH4 and thus FCH4. Based on multiple lines of evidence, we conclude that input of terrestrial organic matter and its subsequent degradation lead to DO depletion, and their OM degradation byproducts serve as carbon substrates that promote CH4 emissions."

During this process, cytochrome c nitrite reductase (NrfA) is regarded as the rate-limiting enzyme. However, the precise electron transfer mechanism between CDs and NrfA remains unclear. Herein, a hybrid photosynthetic system composed of NrfA and redox CDs (NrfA/R-CDs) was constructed, achieving a maximum NH3 production rate of 12.5 ± 1.1 μmol (NH3)·mg–1 (NrfA)·h–1. R-CDs with aromatic ketone groups could store photoinduced electrons, enhancing carrier separation efficiency. These stored photoelectrons were capable of being directly transferred to NrfA without the need of cofactors. Even under dark conditions, direct electron transfer occurred from the stored photoelectrons in R-CDs to NrfA, providing an indirect illumination approach to reduce phototoxicity to NrfA. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations demonstrated the formation of a stable complex between the heme 2 region of NrfA and R-CDs. The short distance (10 Å) and π-electronic interactions between R-CDs and heme 2 facilitated the direct electronic transfer process. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the interfacial photoelectron transfer mechanism and guidelines for constructing nanomaterials with photoelectron storage and release properties."

However, the effectiveness of NBs under various operational conditions, including varying PFAS concentrations, pH levels, and the presence of coexisting ions, has remained insufficiently explored. A deeper understanding of these interfacial interactions is crucial to optimizing and maximizing the efficiency of NBs in PFAS removal. This study aims to bridge these knowledge gaps by systematically exploring the role of NBs in augmenting the adsorption of legacy PFAS on various carbon-based adsorbents, including granular activated carbon (GAC), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and graphene. Our experimental results demonstrated a significant improvement in PFAS adsorption on carbon-based adsorbents in the presence of NBs, with the enhancement effect particularly pronounced at a high initial PFAS concentration (50 mg L–1). Acidic conditions notably facilitated PFAS removal in the NB-assisted carbon adsorption system, aligning well with the predictions from the Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (DLVO) theory. Furthermore, ionic strength was found to play a critical role, with lower levels stabilizing NBs and promoting interactions with adsorbent surfaces, while higher levels reduced the effectiveness of NBs. Additionally, multivalent cations (particularly Fe3+) showed a substantially greater enhancement in PFAS removal efficiency compared to Na+ and Ca2+. This study deepens the understanding of NB-assisted PFAS removal using carbon-based adsorbents and provides practical insights into optimizing treatment processes."

The present study intends to elucidate the behavior of arsenic in Fe-SOM-As composites formed through adsorption or coprecipitation under redox conditions. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) showed that crystalline minerals were generated during Fe-HA-As coprecipitation, while other composites exhibited an amorphous structure. In an anoxic environment, iron-reducing bacteria reduced Fe(III) and As(V) to Fe(II) and As(III), respectively, enhancing the mobility of arsenic. The presence of SOM increased the concentrations of dissolved Fe(II) and As(III) through complexation. Notably, elevated As(III) and reduced Fe(II) were observed in the HA-containing coprecipitation group due to the weak adsorption capacity of crystalline minerals, which released As(V) into solution and competed with Fe(III) for electrons. Under oxic conditions, superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radical (•OH) were formed through the oxidation of Fe(II) and reduced SOM. As(III) was subsequently oxidized by superoxide and •OH, and the process was dominated by •OH. Substantial •OH in the HA-containing coprecipitation group mainly oxidized dissolved As(III), while limited •OH in other groups contributed greater to adsorbed As(III). These findings contribute substantially to understanding the mechanisms of the coupled transformation of iron and arsenic in soil under fluctuating redox conditions."

In this study, we investigated the effects of NMP size, concentration, and diatom supply on the production and settling of fecal pellets by the marine copepod Parvocalanus crassirostris. By employing an aggregation-induced emission fluorescence imaging technique, we visualized the distribution of NMPs in fecal pellets, measured their size and production rate, and developed a fluid dynamic model to simulate the settling process of fecal pellets in the water column. Our results indicated that NPs and MPs exhibited uniform and nonuniform distributions in the produced fecal materials, respectively. NMPs reduced both the size and integrity of copepod fecal pellets. Copepods ingested MPs in the absence of diatoms, but exposure to 5000 μg/L of NMPs decreased the fecal pellet production by 52% in the presence of diatoms due to feeding selectivity. The sinking rates of fecal pellets of varying sizes, as obtained from modeling simulations, ranged from 10.9 to 103.1 m/day.

However, population-based evidence about their effects on maternal gut microbiota dynamics, as well as the intergenerational impacts on neonatal gut microbiota, has been lacking. We examined the longitudinal microbiota data from mother–infant dyads and demonstrated that maternal trace element exposure played a pivotal role in shaping the composition and similarity of the mother–infant gut microbiota. Specifically, serum levels of cobalt (Co), molybdenum (Mo), and rubidium (Rb) were identified to cause further fluctuation in the shift of the maternal gut microbiota. Antibiotic usage shortly before or on the delivery day, as well as maternal zinc (Zn) exposure, affected the gut microbiota similarity within mother–infant dyads. Rb demonstrated an intergenerational effect on meconium Bifidobacterium abundance by altering its abundance in the maternal gut. Notably, this effect was strengthened in the vaginal delivery group without antibiotic usage, while it was attenuated in the c-section delivery group.

Results found that α34Sg→p (−3.7‰ to +9.9‰) obtained by gas-to-particle δ34S showed a significant difference with α34Sg→p-estimated(−6.4‰ to +1.4‰) obtained by δ34SO42–, implying different results for SO42– formation using the two methods. Among them, α34Sg→p results indicated the prominent pathway of NO2 oxidation (48–56%), while α34Sg→p-estimated suggested the dominant role of transition metal ion (TMI)-catalyzed O2 (54–80%). Additionally, α34Sg→p results show a more reasonable response to SO42– formation and consistent trends with oxidant concentrations. α34Sg→p-estimated overestimated the TMI-catalyzed O2 pathway contribution (38–47%) to SO42– formation. This is the first study to employ gas-to-particle δ34S to demonstrate the dominant role of NO2 oxidation in SO42– formation. This approach provides new insight into using δ34SO42– for the analysis of SO42– formation."

To address this gap, we investigate the chemical transformation of BBOA from wildfire events in the western U.S., using data from aerosol mass spectrometers aboard the DOE G-1 aircraft and at the Mt. Bachelor Observatory (∼2800 m a.s.l.) during the summers of 2013 and 2019. This study captures dynamic changes in submicron particulate matter (PM1) concentrations and chemical profiles within wildfire plumes that span a broad range of atmospheric ages, from fresh emissions (<30 min) to plumes transported for several days. As plumes age, the oxidation state of organic aerosols (OA) increases, accompanied by the formation of secondary aerosol components such as phenolic secondary OA (SOA) species, carboxylic acids, and potassium sulfate. Early plume evolution is marked by the evaporation of semivolatile components and the formation of alcohol and peroxide functional groups, while extended aging produces more oxidized species, including carboxylic acids and carbonyl compounds. Normalized excess mixing ratios (NEMRs) of OA to CO demonstrate a complex interplay between evaporation, SOA formation, and oxidative loss. Using positive matrix factorization (PMF), we identify distinct BBOA types representing various stages of atmospheric processing and assess the contributions of primary BBOA and secondary BBOA formed through atmospheric reactions. These findings shed light on the intricate mechanisms governing the evolution of BBOA characteristics within wildfire plumes, providing critical insights to improve atmospheric modeling of BBOA and better assess the environmental and climatic impacts of wildfire emissions."

The chemical analyses were conducted on archived extracts of polyurethane foam (PUF) disk passive air samplers deployed across eight locations (including residential, industrial, semiurban, and traffic areas) over successive 2-month periods in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada. Principal component analysis showed distinct profiles in traffic-heavy locations, where benzothiazole and 6PPD-quinone had maximal concentrations of 2100 pg/m3 and 3.4 pg/m3, and where several TDCs including 6PPD-quinone, benzotriazoles, and some benzothiazoles were elevated during winter months. HMMM had elevated concentrations in nontraffic sectors, suggesting anthropogenic sources other than tires. This study recognizes the unique challenges to accurately quantifying TDCs in ambient air and that results presented here should be considered semiquantitative. To reduce uncertainty, temperature-dependent PUF disk-air partition coefficients (KPUF-AIR) and gas-particle partitioning fractions of TDCs in ambient air are presented. These are calculated from KOA values derived from quantum chemical methods using COSMOtherm and show that TDCs span a wide range of volatilities and gas-particle partitioning behavior, with implications for atmospheric fate and exposure. Lastly, guidance is provided on future measures to evaluate and minimize degradation losses of TDCs during sampling, extraction, and storage."

Reduced bone mineral density (BMD) is associated with an increased risk of developing osteoporosis. This pioneering study aims to assess the effects of different PFAS compounds on bone mineral. We conducted searches on online databases. Inclusion criteria included the presence of associations between perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) and BMD, BMD z-score, and bone mineral content (BMC). Meta-analyses were performed. Best evidence synthesis (BES) was performed to summarize the results. The results of BES showed that the evidence of PFOS, PFOA and PFNA with reduced bone mineral were moderate. The variability in methods for assessing bone mineral and sex differences are potential sources of heterogeneity in the results. Meta analysis showed that PFOA was associated with BMD (β −0.01, 95% CI −0.01 to −0.00; I2 = 0%). Subgroup analysis by sex showed that PFOS (β −0.01, 95% CI −0.01 to −0.00; I2 = 50%), PFOA (β −0.01, 95% CI −0.01 to +0.00; I2 = 29%) were negatively correlated with BMD. This systematic review and BES revealed negative correlations between exposure to PFOS, PFOA, PFNA and bone mineral. Sex emerged as a potential factor affecting the negative effects of PFAS on bone mineral. The damage of PFAS to bone mineral still requires further exploration."

The RAPID mooring array has observed an AMOC weakening of 1.0 [0.4–1.6] Sv per decade from 2004 to 2023, consistent with climate model projections and not consistent with a collapse in the mid‐21st century. Here, we analyze the AMOC change within a signal‐to‐noise framework. We find a strong signal in Lower North Atlantic Deep Water (LNADW) and thermocline transports. By removing the influence of Ekman transport on AMOC and LNADW estimates, we reduce noise by 30% and 22%, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrate that a simple model of LNADW yields a comparable signal‐to‐noise ratio to the full AMOC estimate.

However, the effect of extreme heatwaves on this sensitivity remains uncertain. Here, we present controlled measurements of isoprene temperature responses for a subtropical eucalyptus species, revealing a surprising shift during heatwaves. During non‐heatwave periods, isoprene emissions followed established temperature sensitivity patterns with a well‐defined optimum temperature (Topt); However, heatwaves restricted plant physiological processes, resulting in an unexpected decrease in Topt. Current models, which consider acclimation effect based on long‐term temperature averages, failed to capture this shift, predicting higher Topt values during heatwaves. Remarkably, simulations using the default model curve that assumes no acclimation accurately replicated the observed isoprene emissions under both non‐heatwave and heatwave conditions. Our findings highlight the potential for extreme heat to suppress isoprene emissions in tropical regions and the need to reconsider isoprene‐temperature relationships under future climate."

Existing algorithms derive carbon export from satellite ocean color, but neglect spatiotemporal offsets created by the temporal lag between production and export, and by horizontal advection. Here, we show that a Lagrangian “growth‐advection” (GA) satellite‐derived product, where plankton succession and export are mapped onto surface oceanic circulation following coastal upwelling, succeeds in representing in situ export off the California coast. In situ export is best represented by a combination of GA export (proportional to modeled zooplankton) and export derived from ocean color (related to local phytoplankton). Both products also correlate with a long‐term time series of abyssal carbon flux. These results provide insights on export spatiotemporal patterns and a path toward improving satellite‐derived carbon export in the California Current and beyond."

Owing to the complexity of the climate system, the variability in US winter (DJF) precipitation response to ENSO is investigated. By regressing autoencoder neural network‐based ENSO types (i.e., encoded tropical Pacific Sea surface temperature anomaly patterns) onto DJF US precipitation, supplemented with support vector regression and extreme gradient‐boosting regression, we show that ENSO modulation of precipitation is regionally sensitive to the ENSO type. Certain regions exhibit significant nonlinear relationships between precipitation and strong ENSO event phase that was most pronounced over the eastern and northwestern quadrants of the US. The coherency of the response varies among individual events. Specifically, among individual events, differences in ENSO SST anomaly patterns were linked to meridional shifts in the positioning of the Pacific jet stream. This leads to variable anomalous upper‐level flow and atmospheric conditions influencing US winter precipitation during the ENSO events. By analyzing associations between DJF precipitation and ENSO types whilst assessing the consistency of precipitation anomalies during strong ENSO events, we identify the regional likelihood of consistent precipitation responses, thereby calibrating confidence in seasonal ENSO‐precipitation responses."

The organic molecular composition in ambient PM2.5 samples was measured using an ultrahigh performance liquid chromatograph coupled with an electrospray ionization Orbitrap high‐resolution mass spectrometer. We found that OrgS (including CHOS and CHONS herein) were ubiquitously present across these environments and predominated the number of organic species assigned in negative ionization mode. The fractions of OrgS (mean 41%–45%) in total number of organic species over the Guanzhong basin were at the upper range compared with those in worldwide areas (12%–37%), primarily attributing to the high levels of anthropogenic pollutants (SO2, NOx, sulfate, etc.) across this region. Organosulfates and nitrooxy‐organosulfates in aliphatic‐like structures from long‐chain alkanes and biogenic precursors constituted a majority number of OrgS, yet with distinct molecular characteristics in each environment. The distribution of the number of carbon atoms in the molecules revealed that OrgS mainly originated from complex mixed sources at the urban site, whereas biogenic precursors were more prevalent at the non‐urban sites. The production of OrgS resulted from synergistic interactions of multiple influencing factors in different conditions.

The ETM plays an important role in influencing ENSO's seasonal transition from boreal winter to the following summer by affecting zonal winds in the central‐eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean during boreal spring. In this study, we show that ETM's spatial pattern and seasonality are robustly captured by the CMIP6 models' historical simulations. However, they struggle to capture its multidecadal variability. Nonetheless, these models effectively depict ETM's influence on equatorial winds, thereby affecting the seasonal transition of ENSO from boreal winter to the following summer (ΔT). We further demonstrate that the models that more accurately represent the relationship between ETM and ΔT (referred to as “Good ETM models”) are those in which ΔT is less influenced by the preceding winter Niño3.4 sea‐surface temperature anomalies (N34DJF) and largely influenced by phases of ETM. Additionally, these models better capture the 2–7‐year spectral peak observed in N34DJF. On the contrary, Bad ETM models are characterized by a dominant higher‐frequency, 2–3‐year quasi‐biennial peak. Consequently, Good ETM models render ENSO states that align more closely with observations compared with Bad ETM models.

Accurate prediction of air quality effects from wildfires remains challenging due to uncertainties in fire emission estimates. To enhance the accuracy of fire emissions used in air quality forecast models, we developed a method that utilizes satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations and air quality simulations to calculate dynamic emission scaling factors and improve wildfire air quality forecasts. TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) UV Aerosol Index (UVAI) data are employed to fill AOD gaps under thick smoke using two approaches: a regression model and an artificial intelligence model. The scaling factor method was applied to NOAA blended Global Biomass Burning Emissions Product. The emission scaling factors exhibited significant variability across different fire points, highlighting the need for point‐specific scaling factors. On average, scaling factors were less than 1.0 (indicating emission overestimation) during the initial stages of fire events but exceeded 1.0 (suggesting underestimation) after 7 days of fire duration. An inverse relationship between scaling factors and fire radiative power (FRP) was observed, with emission underestimation for low‐intensity fires (FRP <5 MW) and substantial overestimation for high‐intensity fires (FRP >500 MW). The improved fire emissions were employed in the air quality model for the 2020 US Gigafire event.

The ice core was analyzed to investigate the relationship between sea salt aerosols (SSAs), sea ice dynamics, and atmospheric circulation. The first component of Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis (32SC REOF1), which explains 58% of the variance in the ice core ions, serves as a proxy for SSAs. Time series correlation analysis reveals that sea ice had a minimal impact on 32SC REOF1. Instead, it showed a significant correlation with winter meridional atmospheric transport from the Southern Indian Ocean to PEL. The sea salt records exhibit a significant increase from the period 1616–1850 to 1851–2016 CE, with the mean value increasing by a factor of 2.4. This centennial‐scale trend is likely linked to shifts in the position of the Southern Hemisphere Westerly Winds (SHWW). During the earlier period (1616–1850 CE), which was likely characterized by a colder climate, the SHWW in the Southern Indian Ocean sector may have shifted equatorward and weakened in intensity, potentially leading to reduced cyclone frequency and a subsequent decline in SSAs transport to high latitudes. In contrast, the period 1851–2016 CE, which is likely warmer, saw the SHWW shifted poleward, enhancing meridional wind speeds and increasing SSAs transport. Comparisons with other Antarctic ice core records suggest that the centennial‐scale shift in the SHWW is a regional phenomenon, particularly pronounced in the Southern Indian Ocean."

A seasonal analysis was conducted across specific regions in North America. Results showed that the use of COSP2 is essential for comparing CRCM6‐GEM5 outputs against satellite data to account for variable definitions and signal attenuation of active instruments (e.g., Cloud‐Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization: CALIOP). Spatial and vertical cloud distributions and seasonal patterns were generally well represented by the CRCM6‐GEM5 for both winter (December–February) and summer (June–August). High‐ and low‐level clouds were particularly well‐represented, especially in winter. The CRCM6‐GEM5 model demonstrated some difficulty producing enough clouds to accurately represent those at mid‐level. Cloud fraction representation was systematically better during winter than summer. The CRCM6‐GEM5 generally performed well over the whole North American domain for the four cloud categories and COSP2 was confirmed to help mitigate discrepancies in variable definitions. These results contribute to a better understanding of the CRCM6‐GEM5 cloud representations and the use of COSP2 with high‐resolution models."

Here, the authors show that dopamine neurons projecting to the posterior tail of the striatum encode a prediction error signal important for driving associative fear learning. 
 Learning by experience that certain cues in the environment predict danger is crucial for survival. How dopamine (DA) circuits drive this form of associative learning is not fully understood. Here, in male mice, we demonstrate that DA neurons projecting to a unique subregion of the dorsal striatum, the posterior tail of the striatum (TS), encode a prediction error (PE) signal during associative fear learning. These DA neurons are necessary specifically during acquisition of fear learning, but not once the fear memory is formed, and are not required for forming cue-reward associations. Notably, temporally-precise inhibition or excitation of DA terminals in TS impairs or enhances fear learning, respectively. Furthermore, neuronal activity in TS is crucial for the acquisition of associative fear learning and learning-induced activity patterns in TS critically depend on DA input. Together, our results reveal that DA PE signaling in a non-canonical nigrostriatal circuit is important for driving associative fear learning.

 The large indicated associations between aerosols and cloud radiative effects imply large negative radiative forcing, i.e., cooling incurred by the aerosols’ effects on clouds, if their relationships are causal. The alternative explanation is aerosol-meteorology co-variability. Here, we examine whether aerosols are the primary driver of aerosol-cloud co-variability, i.e., constituting susceptibility of the cloud properties to aerosols. It is done by domains affected by volcanic aerosols, where the aerosol-meteorology co-variability is expected to be minimized. We hypothesize that volcanic aerosols would reduce aerosol-meteorology co-variability under similar meteorology, thus diminishing aerosol-cloud co-variability. However, our findings in both volcanic and non-volcanic regions across the global oceans indicate a consistent pattern of aerosol-cloud co-variability. This does not prove definitively a causal link between aerosols and cloud properties, but mininimizes the probability that meteorological co-variability is a major cause."

 Winter atmospheric rivers (ARs) are crucial for water supply and extreme weather events over the western (WUS) and eastern US (EUS), yet their long-term trends and interplay remain unclear. Here we fill this gap by analyzing multiple observational AR products over the past four decades. Contrasting yet interrelated trends emerge in AR frequency, intensity, and associated mean precipitation. A decline in AR activity over WUS contributes to a drying trend, while notable increases over EUS foster a wetter climate. These trends are driven by large-scale atmospheric and oceanic variability in the Pacific, which strengthens anticyclonic circulation patterns near both coasts. These anticyclonic patterns, however, have opposing effects–impeding ARs from steering to WUS while facilitating their development over EUS. Our findings present a unified explanation for the observed AR trends and have co-beneficial implications for mitigating concerns related to AR-induced extreme events across both densely populated coastal regions."

 The long-term global cooling of the Late Cretaceous was interrupted by an intense warming period at ~69 Ma known as the mid-Maastrichtian event. The underlying mechanisms of this climatic event and associated change in the global carbon cycle are, however, strongly debated, including a possible major reorganization of deep-ocean circulation patterns. How this reorganization co-varied with climate shifts and global carbon cycling is not known, mainly due to the lack of high-resolution studies. Here, we present new high-resolution stable isotope, Mg/Ca-derived bottom-water temperature, and CaCO3 wt% records from IODP Site U1403 (North Atlantic) to reconstruct the climatic and oceanographic processes associated with the mid-Maastrichtian event. We observe a very dynamic and vigorous deep-ocean circulation that is characterized by precession-paced fluctuations that are proposed to reflect the interplay of different bottom-water source regions. Our results further point towards Large Igneous Province volcanism as a trigger not only for the mid-Maastrichtian event but also for the observed change in deep-water circulation. A clear shift towards the dominance of Northern Component Water bathing the North Atlantic at around 68 Ma signals the end of low-latitude waters in the North Atlantic, a bottom-water source that characterized the Cretaceous oceans for tens of millions of years.

 Fuels are a large source of uncertainty in fire emissions estimates due to variability in the physical and chemical properties of fuels and how they are represented. These uncertainties can be addressed using imaging spectroscopy and lidar data, that provide observations of the chemical and physical traits and spatial distribution of vegetation. Combined with ground fuel measurements, these data provide information on fuel distribution and quantity important for mapping and modeling fire effects. In this study, we present a methodology to develop models and continuous maps of pre-fire fuel characteristics for use in fire emissions modeling. We first addressed any spatial gaps over fire areas for Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) chemical trait data using Random Forests regression and for derived fractional cover. We used the AVIRIS fractional cover and chemical traits or AVIRIS estimates alongside lidar, multispectral, and topographic variables to build fuel characteristic models informed by ground measurements with partial least squares regression. We derived maps of predictive uncertainty alongside a suite of uncertainty statistics for each fuel characteristic that inform the use of fuels data within fire effects models. We used two study sites: the Williams Flats wildfire in eastern Washington state, USA and three prescribed crown fires in Utah, USA. The results show similar error between calibration and validation sets and NRMSE of around 20 % or lower for a majority of the fuel models.

The surface-exposed areas of the caldera were investigated using satellite hyperspectral imagery acquired by the German Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) mission. Satellite data were validated via ground spectroscopy, performed through hyperspectral imaging, complemented by mineralogical and geochemical analyses on specimens deriving from the Jindalee McDermitt Li deposit.The Li mineralization in the Jindalee McDermitt deposit is dominated by a Mg(Li)-smectite (hectorite) + amorphous silica assemblage, showing absorption features at 2306 nm and 2200 nm that can be detected in the spectral range covered by the EnMAP sensor. The analysis of the corresponding hyperspectral feature distribution maps and the comparison with ground control samples, confirmed that the above features together can be effectively used as mineralogical-hyperspectral vectors for Li-prospective areas on a caldera-scale.

 Increasing frequency and severity of drought events impact global and domestic agricultural productivity. Monitoring drought in agricultural fields with remote sensing can provide faster, lower-cost decision management support for critical field management activities. We evaluated the application of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) emitted at red (SIFRed) and far-red (SIFFarRed) wavelengths in comparison with chlorophyll- and xanthophyll-sensitive reflectance-based remote sensing indices (NDVI, NIRV, NIRVP and PRI) for drought stress monitoring at the canopy scale. To do so, we evaluated impacts of drought stress on two soybean varieties with similar phenology but contrasting affinities for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), which can provide host plants with extended access to water and nutrients in exchange for carbohydrates. Drought response physiology of the two genotypes was further explored using leaf level photosynthetic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, water potential and phenology. We observed distinct responses, with the low-affinity genotype exhibiting lower SIFRed and more negative midday leaf water potential, as well as reduced growth and development rate compared with the high-affinity genotype. SIFFarRed and NIRVP exhibited the strongest correlation with canopy photosynthesis followed by NIRV. We also observed different timing of drought response parameters associated with different remote sensing signals.

 High-resolution near-surface NO2 data are crucial for monitoring air pollution dynamics. Satellite-based machine learning models are commonly used to estimate NO2 concentrations, but tailoring advanced deep learning techniques to specific environmental problems remains challenging. This study applies a two-stage deep learning approach to estimate ground-level NO2 concentrations in England at a 1 km spatial resolution from 2019 to 2021. Initially, we imputed the TROPOMI NO2 column density to a continuous 1 km resolution. We then developed an efficient spatial-and-local-aware deep learning network (SLNet) for NO2 mapping by integrating the imputed TROPOMI NO2 data with multi-source information from meteorology, chemical transport model (CTM) simulations, and other auxiliary predictors. To address the translation invariance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we combined a local channel to identify spatial heterogeneity in the model. Our imputed TROPOMI NO2 surfaces, which initially covered only 34.12 % of valid data, achieved full coverage with reliability and continuity at 1 km spatial resolution. Cross-validation confirmed that the SLNet model outperformed other state-of-the-art methods in estimating ground-level NO2. The prediction model achieved R2 values of 0.914, 0.919, and 0.887 for 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively, and performed well in urban regions. Additionally, the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method revealed that features such as satellite and CTM NO2, precipitation, green space, and road density significantly contributed to estimations through both spatial and local channels. The mapping results closely aligned with ground-level observations and accurately captured spatial variations.

 The distribution of Arctic sea ice is an important direct indicator of climate change, and spaceborne optical remote sensing represents one primary technique for sea ice monitoring due to its high spatiotemporal resolution and wide swath coverage. However, this process is often impeded by heavy cloud cover, which shares similar visual and spectral features with sea ice. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel methodological framework for discriminating between sea ice and different cloud types (cirrus and cumulus) via the ultraviolet–visible-infrared observations from China’s Haiyang-1C/D (HY-1C/D) satellites, and the ultraviolet (UV) data from the onboard Ultraviolet Imager (UVI) are used to study sea ice and clouds over the Chukchi Sea for the first time. The spectral properties are characterized by the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance (ρTOA) in both UV and visible and near-infrared (VNIR) wavelengths. This indicates that the 355 nm UV band has the optimal sensitivity to the presence of sea ice and clouds, with cirrus clouds composed of high-altitude ice crystals exhibiting extremely high UV reflectivity. A hybrid threshold is subsequently determined to separate sea ice and cloud pixels. In comparison to the MODIS MOD29 sea ice product, which masks cloud pixels with brightness temperature (BT) differences, this algorithm can effectively reduce the misclassification resulting from surface temperature inversions in polar regions. The ice/cloud identification results have been further applied to sea ice concentration (SIC) estimation, and extensive trials of this UV-based ice/cloud detection approach in the Arctic Passages demonstrates its potential applicability."

 Driven by urban expansion and economic growth, China has carried out extensive coastal reclamation in the past four decades, leading to negative ecological impacts. Accurate mapping of reclamation dynamics helps analyze its environmental effects and supports the government in regulating reclamation projects. Nevertheless, existing methods for monitoring coastal reclamation dynamics face two major limitations: overestimating reclamation areas and low temporal accuracy. This study proposes a novel method to automatically distinguish artificial reclamation from natural expansion to reduce the overestimation of reclaimed areas and improve temporal dynamic accuracy through time-series analysis of long-term Landsat satellite imagery. In China’s coastal regions, our method achieves an overall classification accuracy of over 94 % for artificial reclamation and natural expansion. The estimation accuracies of the year of reclamation are 91.60 % (one-year tolerance) and 96.44 % (two-year tolerance), which are more accurate than the post-classification comparison method based on the Global Surface Water (GSW) dataset. From 1990 to 2022, China’s coastal reclamation totaled 5,121.1 km2, with a slowdown after 2014 and a shift toward green development after 2018. Reclamation patterns varied regionally, with most projects concentrated in economically developed bays, driven primarily by urbanization and industrialization.

 Aerosol properties over the Tibetan Plateau exert important impacts on weather and climate in this area and downstream regions. The influence of dust on aerosol properties over this region has been demonstrated by previous studies based on remote sensing. However, there is still a lack of knowledge regarding how aerosol properties were influenced by dust and the evolution of dust events, especially in a temporally and vertically resolved way. In this study, aerosol microphysical and optical properties in summer were investigated by in-situ surface and tethered-balloon borne observations, which were also utilized to explore dust events with a joint analysis of the MERRA-2 reanalysis data and HYSPLIT backward trajectories. The PM1/PM10 ratios and scattering Ångström exponents were found to be quite low at most of the time during the campaign even in the absence of dust events, evidently suggesting that surface aerosol properties were persistently influenced by dust. Particle mass size distributions in the free troposphere also clearly revealed fingerprints of dust. An examination on individual dust event indicated that dust particles could be of local origins or long-range transported from deserts to the north of the plateau.

 Brown carbon (BrC) is the ubiquitous part of the atmospheric organic carbon. It absorbs solar lights and greatly impacts the Earth's radiative balance. This study examines the spectral characteristics of BrC and its radiative effect in the Dhaka South (DS) site and Dhaka North (DN) site from July 2023 to January 2024 with a high-volume particulate matter sampler on quartz filters. Spectral characteristics such as absorption coefficient (babs-λ), mass absorption efficiency (MAE), absorption angstrom exponent (AAE), and refractive index (Κabs-λ) were determined by using a UV–visible spectrophotometer, and fluorescence emission spectra were analyzed in different pH by the fluorescent spectrophotometer. The concentrations of BrC and black carbon (BC) were determined by an aethalometer. The mean concentrations of BrC and BC in Dhaka city were 18.63 ± 3.84 μg m−3 and 17.93 ± 3.82 μg m−3, respectively. The AAE values lie in the range of 3.20–4.01 (DN) and 3.27–4.53 (DS), and the radiative forcing efficiency of BrC was obtained at 4.43 ± 1.02 W g−1 in DN and 3.93 ± 0.74 W g−1 in DS, indicating the presence of highly light-absorbing BrC in these locations. Average MAE and Κabs-λ values were 1.55 ± 0.45 m2g-1 and 0.044 ± 0.013, respectively, in DS, alternatively 1.84 ± 0.59 m2g-1 and 0.052 ± 0.016 in DN. The fluorescence excitation-emission spectra confirmed the presence of a polyconjugate cyclic ring with multifunctional groups in the structure of BrC. Light absorption properties and fluorescence emission spectra were varied with the change of pH. As the pH increased (2–8), the AAE value decreased and MAEBrC-365 increased due to protonation or deprotonation. This study highlights that the BrC has a significant impact on the air quality as well as the Earth's radiative balance, emphasizing its strong light-absorbing properties and variability with environmental factors."

 Satellite measurements of short-lived gaseous pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) provide an unprecedented opportunity to infer global distribution of their emission sources. However, the great differences in the magnitude of anthropogenic emissions have hampered the identification of pollution sources with satellite observations. In this study, we identified NO2 and CO pollution hotspots in China with oversampled TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) concentration data by utilizing an image segmentation method at provincial scale. We also determined the major emitting sectors associated with the pollution hotspots in each province. Based on NO2 pollution hotspots, we can find major emission sources, such as ports, airports, industrial and urban areas. In the hotspots of most provinces, Steel plant, Coke plant, and Power plant were identified as the main NOx emission sources. CO pollution hotspots were closely linked to Steel plant, with additional contributions from Coke plant, Chemical industry, and Non-ferrous metal smelting in certain provinces. The pollution hotspots and their corresponding concentrations yielded a relatively strong correlation with Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC) (For NO2, the R2 was 0.937 in provinces with small land area and 0.654 in others, while for CO, the R2 was 0.849 and 0.659, respectively). Our results can provide an observational constraint on the spatial locations of NOx and CO emission sources for emission inventories."

 Notable “roller coaster”-type temperature fluctuations occurred in the 2024 winter in China though the seasonal mean temperature displayed a normal value. The standard deviation of daily temperature anomalies broke the highest record since 1961. By adopting an objective definition of the “roller coaster”-type temperature fluctuation, 19 events of such occurrences are observed during 1981–2024, four of which occurred in the 2024 winter. Corresponds to the temperature fluctuations in the winter, the Siberian high exhibits a synchronous variation, with significantly greater intensities in the three cold spells and considerably weaker values in the three warm spells. In contrast, the Polar front jet displays an asymmetric influence, with significantly enhanced zonal wind speeds in warm spells, while normal intensity in cold spells. The statistical results for each of the 45-day warm and cold groups in the current winter also support this conclusion."

 El Niño event usually intensifies Hadley Circulation (HC), meanwhile reducing its meridional extension. From a global perspective, the width change of HC is associated with the meridional movement of baroclinic instability and eddy activities over the subtropics. However, these hypotheses may not work for regional HC. In this study, we construct the three-dimensional structure of HC and investigate the El Niño-related regional HC variability, focusing on the meridional extension. El Niño is associated with an expansion of HC over the central-eastern Pacific but a contraction over the west. Unlike the global HC, the strengthening (weakening) of regional HC usually coincides with an expansion (contraction). Nevertheless, the “narrow” equatorial intensification over the eastern Pacific and the “widespread” subtropical weakening over the Indo-Western Pacific of regional HC collectively form a strengthening and contraction of global HC. This spatial pattern of regional HC intensity changes is tightly associated with the ENSO-related precipitation and sea surface temperature (SST) gradient anomalies. Our result has broad implications for global climate predictability, highlighting the importance of a better understanding of the interactions between the regional HC and tropical/subtropical climate variabilities."

Here, we report a remarkable finding of compressed H2-molecular–type hydride CaH14exhibiting an unusual transition temperature (Tc) of 204.0 kelvin. The peculiarity of its electronic structure lies in the pronounced emergence of near-free electrons, which manifest metallic bonding, but molecular hydrogen fragments persist. This finding indicates that the necessary condition for superconducting transition is forming the Fermi sea with Cooper pairs rather than the monatomic hydrogen. Notably, the formation mechanism of free electrons can be effectively explained by the finite-depth potential wells model. Intriguingly, this H2-molecular–type hydride can downgrade the required pressure to 80 gigapascal while maintaining a highTcof 84 kelvin, well above the liquid-nitrogen temperature.

Here, we investigated the role of circadian clocks in regulating the pathogenesis of the fungal pathogenFusarium oxysporum, which has multiple genes homologous to theNeurospora crassa frqdue to gene duplication events, withFofrq1being the primary circadian clock gene. The pathogenesis ofF. oxysporumin plants is controlled by its circadian clock, with infections causing severe disease symptoms at dawn. Notably, disruption of clock genes dramatically reduces fungal pathogenicity. Circadian clocks regulate the rhythmic expression of several transcription factors, including FoZafA, which enables the pathogen to adapt to zinc starvation within the plant, and FoCzf1, which governs the production of the toxin fusaric acid. Together, our findings highlight the critical roles of circadian clocks inF. oxysporumpathogenicity by regulating zinc starvation response and secondary metabolite production."
