We explored how black carbon (BC) responded to these measures and found that a reduction in liquid fuel use was the main factor driving a decrease in BC levels. Additionally, meteorological factors also played a significant role in the long-term trends of BC. These factors should be considered in future emission reduction policies to further enhance air quality improvements. 
 Black carbon (BC) is an essential component of particulate matter (PM), with a significant impact on climate change. Few studies have investigated the long-term changes in BC and its sources, particularly considering primary emissions of BC, which is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. Here, 3-year BC observations (2019–2021) are reported in Nanjing, a polluted city in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, eastern China. The results revealed that the average BC concentration was 2.5 ± 1.6 µg m−3, peaking in winter, with approximately 80 % attributed to liquid fuel combustion. Based on 3-year monitoring data, the random forest (RF) algorithm was employed to reconstruct BC concentrations in Nanjing from 2014 to 2021. Source apportionment was conducted on the reconstructed time series, which revealed a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in BC levels over the 8-year period, primarily due to reduced emissions from liquid fuels. Compared to the earlier control policy period (P1: 2013–2017), BC concentrations declined more steeply after 2018 (P2) due to reduced solid fuel burning. The seasonal analysis indicated significant reductions (p < 0.05) in BC, BCliquid (black carbon from liquid fuel combustion) and BCsolid (black carbon from solid fuel combustion) during winter, with BCliquid accounting for 77 % of the reduction. Overall, emission reduction was the dominant factor in lowering BC levels, contributing between 62 % and 86 %, though meteorological conditions played an increasingly important role in P2, particularly for BC and BCliquid. Our results demonstrate that targeted control measures for liquid fuel combustion are necessary, as it is a major driver of BC reduction, and highlight the non-negligible influence of meteorological factors on long-term BC variations."

 Sulfur dioxide emitted during volcanic eruptions can be hazardous for aviation safety. As part of their activities, the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centres (VAACs) are therefore interested in the real-time atmospheric monitoring of this gas. A recent development aims at improving the forecasts of volcanic sulfur dioxide quantities made by the MOCAGE (Modèle de Chimie Atmosphérique à Grande Échelle) chemistry transport model. For this purpose, observations from both TROPOMI (Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument) and IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer; B and C) located on separate polar-orbiting satellites are assimilated into the model. These sulfur dioxide measurements are based on the eruption event of the La Soufrière Saint Vincent volcano in April 2021. Observations from OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) are considered validation data. The resulting assimilation experiments show that the combined assimilation of IASI and TROPOMI observations always leads to a better forecast compared to the independent assimilation of data from each instrument. Sulfur dioxide atmospheric field forecasts are better when the available observations are numerous and cover a long time window."

Gámiz-Fortis;María Jesús Esteban-Parra,HighResClimNevada: a high-resolution climatological dataset for a high-altitude region in southern Spain (Sierra Nevada),"This work aims to present a series of climate datasets for Sierra Nevada, a region especially vulnerable to climate change in southern Spain. The database consists of primary climate variables such as precipitation, temperature, radiation, wind speed, pressure, and atmospheric humidity and also bioclimatic variables and extreme indices, which are both useful pieces of information for assessing the impact of climate change in this region. These datasets are only available on Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14883471. 
 Climate datasets with very high spatiotemporal resolution are essential to assess the impacts of climate change in mountain areas, which are complex systems in which climate is very changeable. However, these regions are characterized by a lack of climatic information, and if there is any, it is usually short, sparse, or incomplete. This work presents a new series of very high resolution (1 km) gridded climate datasets for Sierra Nevada (SN), a mountain range classified as a double climate change hotspot as it is a semi-arid mountain range in the Mediterranean area that is particularly vulnerable to climate change. The database, called HighResClimNevada, consists of a set of climate data derived from a climate simulation using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model for the period from 1991–2022 and forced with the European ReAnalysis (ERA5).  HighResClimNevada provides not only hourly and daily primary climate variables (i.e., near-surface temperature, precipitation, near-surface relative humidity, surface pressure, surface net radiation, and wind speed), but also bioclimatic variables, extremes indices from the Expert Team of Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI), and precipitation-hour indicators, which were postprocessed using aggregated temperature and precipitation values from primary climate variables. To evaluate the database performance, HighResClimNevada temperature and precipitation values were compared with reference datasets from different sources. In general, HighResClimNevada captures reasonably well not only the spatiotemporal variability of raw temperature, but also bioclimatic variables and extreme indices in SN. It displays comparable behavior to other climatic products but with a greater level of detail due to its higher spatial resolution. For precipitation, which is variable, more uncertain, and difficult to characterize, HighResClimNevada exhibits a higher amount of precipitation when compared to station-based, coarse satellite-based, and reanalysis-based products. However, the latter two present problems in characterizing precipitation in high mountain regions probably due to the scarcity of data in areas with high spatiotemporal variability, such as SN. The precipitation from HighResClimNevada is comparable to other climatic products like CHIRPS or CERRA-Land, which captures better the spatiotemporal variability in this region. These findings, therefore, suggest HighResClimNevada as a valuable long-term climate tool for a variety of applications, including land management, hydrometeorological research, flora and fauna phenology, and risk assessment. The reported datasets are freely available for download via the Zenodo platform (Garcia-Valdecasas Ojeda et al., 2025, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14883471)."
10.5194/essd-17-2849-2025,False,Earth System Science Data,该论文主要关注植被光学厚度（VOD）的遥感反演，特别是利用L波段的SMOS和SMAP卫星数据，旨在生成高分辨率、无缝的全球VOD产品。研究重点在于填补数据缺失、融合多源数据，并验证重建和融合产品的质量。虽然VOD与全球碳循环和自然灾害有关，但该研究的核心在于植被参数的反演和时空融合，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、大气成分分析）的关联性不强。,"['vegetation optical depth', 'L-band sensors', 'SMOS', 'SMAP', 'vegetation water content', 'carbon cycle', 'natural disasters (floods, droughts, forest fires)']",Die Hu;Yuan Wang;Han Jing;Linwei Yue;Qiang Zhang;Lei Fan;Qiangqiang Yuan;Huanfeng Shen;Liangpei Zhang,A global daily seamless 9 km vegetation optical depth (VOD) product from 2010 to 2021,"Existing L-band vegetation optical depth (L-VOD) products suffer from data gaps and coarse resolution of historical data. Therefore, it is necessary to integrate multi-temporal and multisource L-VOD products. Our study begins with the reconstruction of missing data and then develops a spatiotemporal fusion model to generate global daily seamless 9 km L-VOD products from 2010 to 2021, which are crucial for understanding the global carbon cycle. 
 Vegetation optical depth (VOD) products provide information on vegetation water content and correlate with vegetation growth status; these are closely related to the global water and carbon cycles. The L-band signal penetrates deeper into the vegetation canopy than the higher-frequency bands used for many previous VOD retrievals. Currently, there are only two operational L-band sensors aboard satellites, i.e., the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite launched in 2010 and the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite launched in 2015. The former has the limitation of a low spatial resolution of only 25 km, while the latter has improved this resolution to 9 km but has a shorter usable time range. Due to the influence of sensor and atmospheric conditions as well as the observation methods of polar-orbiting satellites (such as scan gaps and observation revisit times), the daily data provided by both satellites suffer from varying degrees of missing data. In summary, the existing L-band VOD (L-VOD) products suffer from the defects of missing data and coarse resolution of historical data. There is little research on filling gaps and reconstructing 9 km long-term data for L-VOD products. To solve this problem, our study depends on a penalized least-square regression based on a three-dimensional discrete cosine transform to firstly generate the seamless global daily L-VOD products. Subsequently, the nonlocal filtering idea is applied to spatiotemporal fusion between high-resolution and low-resolution data, resulting in a global daily seamless 9 km L-VOD product from 1 January 2010 to 31 July 2021. In order to validate the quality of the products, time series validation and simulated missing-region validation are used for the reconstructed data. The fusion products are validated both temporally and spatially and are also compared numerically with the original 9 km data during the overlapping period. Results show that the seamless SMOS (SMAP) dataset is evaluated with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.855 (0.947) and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.094 (0.073) for the simulated real missing masks. The temporal consistency of the reconstructed daily L-VOD products is ensured with the original time series distribution of valid values. The spatial information of the fusion product and the original 9 km data in the overlapping period is basically consistent (R2: 0.926–0.958, RMSE: 0.072–0.093, and mean absolute error MAE: 0.047–0.064). The temporal variations between the fusion product and the original product are largely synchronized. Our dataset can provide timely vegetation information during natural disasters (e.g., floods, droughts, and forest fires), supporting early disaster warning and real-time responses.

This work presents the first publicly available daily global front dataset spanning 1982 to 2023, with comprehensive validations using in situ global observations. Our validations enhance confidence in the application of satellite-based front detection and provide independent support for global front occurrence patterns. The dataset is expected to be widely used in front-related studies. 
 Ocean fronts have garnered significant attention from researchers across various scientific disciplines due to their profound ecological and climatic impacts. The development of front detection algorithms has enabled the automatic extraction of frontal information from satellite observations, providing valuable tools for understanding the biophysical interactions within marine ecosystems. However, the lack of comprehensive validation and comparison of cross-satellite products against in situ observations, along with limited accessibility to frontal datasets, must be addressed to enable the broader application of front detection algorithms. This study promoted the improved histogram-based front detection algorithm to global oceans with additional enhancements, generating the first publicly available, high-resolution, daily global mesoscale front dataset spanning from 1982 to 2023 (Xing et al., 2024a, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14373832). Global validation using in situ underway observations shows that most in situ and satellite-detected fronts can be matched with each other, with high temporal and spatial consistency, demonstrating the dataset's acceptable performance in detecting fronts. Cross-dataset comparisons reveal that multi-satellite blended products offer the best front detection performance, followed by observation-assimilated ocean model products, while single-satellite and purely simulated products show the lowest performance. In addition, in situ observations show a strong spatial resemblance to global frontal frequency, providing independent validation of the satellite-based global frontal occurrence map. These results enhance confidence in the application of satellite-based front detection, and our global front dataset and detection algorithm may be valuable for both regional and global studies in marine ecology, fisheries, ocean dynamics, and climate change."

A total of 2,984 sandy beaches were identified with high accuracy by integrating Sentinel-1/2 satellite imagery, terrain, and nighttime light data. Since 1990, the area at risk from human infrastructure squeeze has significantly increased. This study provides an updated dataset to support sustainable coastal management. 
 Sandy beaches provide essential ecological and economic services, but their functions are increasingly threatened by human activities. Analyzing the spatial distribution of China's sandy beaches and the impacts of human activities offers valuable insights for coastal resource management and ecological protection. However, remote sensing technologies face challenges such as limited data sources and tidal influences, which affect recognition accuracy. Therefore, integrating multi-source remote sensing data and reducing the impact of tidal fluctuations to improve recognition accuracy remains a key challenge. This study proposes an innovative approach utilizing multi-source data and an ensemble learning model to identify sandy beaches in China (2016–2023). By integrating Sentinel-1/2 satellite data, terrain data, and nighttime light data, along with spectral, terrain, texture, and polarization features, sandy beaches were identified across multiple years, and the results were consolidated into a single-year dataset to analyze spatial patterns and risks from human infrastructure squeeze. (1) High-precision classification identified 2984 sandy beaches in China, covering a total area of 260.70 km2. Guangdong had the largest number, area, and perimeter, while Shanghai had the widest sandy beaches. (2) In Fujian, Guangdong, and Taiwan, the identified sandy beaches covered 149.68 km2, with perimeters of 5155.91 km and widths of 49.50 m, 32.83 m, and 50.70 m, respectively. These results were significantly better than those from reference datasets. (3) From 1990 to 2023, the area at risk from human infrastructure squeeze increased from 109.95 km2 to 245.58 km2, a rise of 135.63 km2, with the most significant increase occurring between 1990 and 2000. Guangdong and Fujian showed growth rates of 1.05 km2/year and 0.73 km2/year, respectively. This study provides an up-to-date dataset on China's sandy beaches. It assesses their spatial patterns and human impact risks, contributing to research and policy for the sustainable development of coastal zones (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15307240, Meng et al., 2025)."

Yokelson,Age of smoke sampled by aircraft during FIREX-AQ: methods and critical evaluation,"Smoke age is an important factor in the chemical and physical evolution of smoke. Two methods for determining the age of smoke are applied to the NASA-NOAA FIREX-AQ field campaign: one based on wind speed and distance, and another using an ensemble of modeled air parcel trajectories. Both methods are evaluated, with the trajectory method, which includes plume rise and uncertainty estimates, proving more accurate. 
 The age of smoke, meaning the time elapsed since it was produced in a fire, is an important parameter for interpreting measurements of evolving smoke composition. This study describes the smoke age estimates developed for large plumes sampled in the 2019 NASA-NOAA FIREX-AQ field experiment. Smoke ages are computed using two methods and applied to observations from two aircraft: the NASA DC-8 and a NOAA Twin Otter. The first method uses measurements of mean horizontal wind speed, as observed by the sampling aircraft, and distance to the fire to provide a single age estimate for each plume-crossing performed by the aircraft. While this ""mean-wind method"" uses accurate wind measurements, it can be systematically biased by assumptions that plume rise time is negligible and that winds are homogeneous horizontally and in time during the plume transport. Wind inhomogeneities due to terrain effects and day-to-night transition, among other factors, affected some plumes during FIREX-AQ. The mean-wind method therefore performs best for short-range transport over level terrain with steady winds. The second method relies on upwind air parcel trajectories and plume rise computed with multiple high-resolution meteorological datasets. This ""trajectory-based method"" quantifies age uncertainty from the meteorological ensemble, plume rise speed, wind speed errors, and fire location. The second method also resolves age differences from the center to edge of a transect. Still, it is susceptible to errors in the meteorological model. With careful comparison of the simulated trajectories to smoke transport observed from geostationary satellite imagery described here, we filter out many trajectory errors and improve the smoke age estimates. The two age methods are strongly correlated (R = 0.93) for the periods during FIREX-AQ when both ages are available. The mean-wind age is systematically 14 % younger than the trajectory-based age and the median absolute difference between them is 19 % (23 % for mean). The favorable agreement between the two age methods reflects that the mean-wind method was selectively applied to plumes with little wind variability. Trajectory-based ages are available for more of the FIREX-AQ smoke observations than the mean-wind ages. The median trajectory-based age uncertainty during FIREX-AQ is 24 % and the mean uncertainty is 37 %, due to a long-tailed distribution. The main source of age uncertainty is spread within the meteorological ensemble, followed by discrepancy between measured and modeled wind speed, then other factors like plume rise. The age uncertainty variable enables the user to identify periods with high or low confidence in the age estimate, thereby informing studies of smoke aging."

A prominent feature in our reconstruction is that it provides an ensemble of 35 complete time series at sites of tide gauge, which allows for direct statistical assessment. The average of our reconstructed global mean sea level shows strong agreements with other reconstructions. 
 Tide gauges record sea level changes along coast. They are widely used to determine the twentieth century global mean sea level (GMSL) rise. However, a major issue in tide gauge data is the presence of various, substantial, and sometime persistent data gaps, which hinder our understanding of sea level rise, especially at regional and local scales. Whilst the GMSL reconstructions have been provided by several influential studies, reconstructions at the exact sites of tide gauges are rarely available. Here, we present sea level reconstructions at global 945 tide gauges, covering the period over 1900 to 2022. Our approach relies on a data assimilation technique that integrates various physical sea level observations and predictions, including sea level simulations from 35 climate models. A prominent feature in our reconstruction is that it provides an ensemble of 35 reconstructions at each site of tide gauge, offering complete and refined sea level time series. This ensemble reconstruction allows for direct statistical assessment, e.g., average, median, spread, and percentile. The average of reconstructed sea level across 945 tide gauges reveals a GMSL rise of 1.75±0.05 mm/yr over 1900–2020, and shows strong agreements with other GMSL reconstructions for both the curves of time series and overall trends. At local scale, our reconstructions are comparable to an independent reconstruction, despite apparent rate differences at locations, it is suggested that our reconstructed sea level trends closely follow the raw records when they are available, emphasizing the importance of the observed sea level rise at tide gauges. Our sea level reconstructions offer a valuable resource for improving global and regional sea level projections, validating climate model performance, and informing coastal adaptation strategies.

Thanks to long-term, multi-temporal, and fine- and medium-resolution satellite missions such as Landsat, MODIS, Copernicus Sentinel and similar, it is possible to produce globally consistent predictions of key soil variables that match other 10–30 m spatial resolution global data sets. This paper describes data preparation, modeling, and production of OpenLandMap-soildb: global dynamic predictions of soil organic carbon content, soil organic carbon density, bulk density, soil pH in H2O, soil texture fractions (clay, sand and slit) and USDA subgroup soil types (USDA soil taxonomy subgroups) at 30 m spatial resolution based on spatiotemporal Machine Learning (Quantile Regression Random Forest with output predictions showing the mean plus the lower and upper prediction intervals of 68 % probability). To train the models, a large compilation of soil samples imported from legacy soil projects was used: 216,000 soil samples with soil carbon density (kg m-3), 408,000 soil samples with soil carbon content (g kg-1), 272,000 samples with soil pH in H2O, 363,000 samples with clay, silt, and sand (%), and 134,000 samples with bulk density oven dry (t m-3). Soil carbon and soil pH were mapped with 5 year time-intervals; soil texture fractions, bulk density, and soil types were mapped for recent years only. The cross-validation results indicate RMSE of 17.7 (kg m-3; 0.486 in log-scale) and CCC of 0.88 for SOC density, RMSE of 51.3 (g kg-1; 0.574 in log-scale) and CCC of 0.87 for SOC content, RMSE of 0.15 (t m-3) and CCC of 0.92 for bulk density of fine-earth, RMSE of 0.51 and CCC of 0.91 for soil pH, RMSE of 8.4 % and CCC of 0.87 for soil clay content, and RMSE of 12.6 % and CCC of 0.84 for soil sand content respectively. The most important variables for predicting soil organic carbon density (kg m-3) were: soil depth, Landsat-based uncalibrated Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and CHELSA bioclimatic indices. The global distribution of soil pH can be primarily explained by the CHELSA Aridity Index (long-term), annual precipitation, and salinity grade. The global stocks for 2020–2022+ period for 0–30 cm depth interval are estimated at 461 Pg (Peta grams); the results further indicate that, in the last 25 years, the world has lost at least 11 Pg of SOC in the top soil. Suggestions are made on how to set up global permanent monitoring stations to accurately track land degradation and enable land restoration projects.

However, whether metabolic profiles differ across biological matrices in response to contaminants remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed urinary concentrations of 38 legacy and emerging contaminants, including 15 metal(loid)s and 23 metabolites of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phthalates, and alternative plasticizers in 74 general residents from southern China using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. High-resolution metabolomics of paired serum and urine samples identified 186 serum and 774 urine metabolites significantly associated with measured contaminant, enriching 12 serum and 22 urine metabolic pathways. Cross-validation across serum and urine metabolomes revealed 37 overlapping metabolites (mainly as 12 lipids and 9 organic acids) and 8 metabolic pathways (7 amino acid-related and 1 sphingolipid pathway) as primary metabolic perturbations. Notwithstanding shared signatures, organic nitrogen and organ heterocyclic compounds comprise a significantly higher proportion in serum and urine. Only serum phenylalanine and leucine were associated with globulin. These findings first characterize metabolic responses to pollutant mixtures and highlight the complementary value of serum (for biomarker screening) and urine (for exposure assessment) metabolomics in environmental health research."

Molecular structure including carbon number and functional groups influences SOA formation. However, limited research was conducted on the vastly different SOA yields among aliphatic carbonyls, and the impact of the molecular structure remains unclear and controversial. In this study, 11 aliphatic carbonyls were photooxidized to study the SOA formation and gas-phase products in an oxidation flow reactor (OFR). The maximum SOA yields of C15 and C13 straight-chain carbonyls are 0.41–0.52 and 0.18–0.23, lower but within a comparable range with long-chain alkanes, whereas those for C8–C10 carbonyls are less than 0.04. Aliphatic carbonyls with more carbon have significantly higher SOA yields, accompanied by additional multigenerational products. The SOA yield of n-aldehyde is moderately higher than that of n-alkan-2-one with the same carbon number, due to the enhanced formation of long-chain acids with lower volatility than dicarbonyls. The saturated cyclic structure increases the SOA yield by forming more multifunctional products with additional aldehyde groups upon ring-opening, whereas the branched structure easily fragmented and decreased the SOA yield. This study highlights that the aliphatic carbonyls with more carbon numbers and a cyclic structure with less branching may have higher SOA yields."

This study simulated a realistic exposure scenario to evaluate the effects of drinking nitrate-contaminated water on the growth, physiology, and antipredator behavior of red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) chicks. Hatchlings were exposed to two nitrate concentrations commonly used in fertigation (100 and 500 mg/L) through ad libitum drinking water over a 28-day period. Nitrate exposure at both concentrations increased chick weight and elevated hematocrit levels, possibly as a compensatory response to nitrate-induced methemoglobinemia. Additionally, it reduced cell-mediated immune responsiveness, indicating a compromised immune function. We simulated aerial and terrestrial predator attacks (raptor and fox) and evaluated behavioral responses of exposed and control chicks. We report nitrate effects on antipredator responses, specifically reduced fleeing distances, altered freezing, and active escape behaviors, which would increase predation risk in the wild. These findings highlight new threats associated with nitrate contamination in agricultural landscapes, particularly for exposed birds that rely on irrigation water during the summer months. This study emphasizes the need to assess the sublethal effects of nitrates in high-exposure scenarios to improve environmental risk assessments and mitigate risks contributing to the population declines in farmland species."

Here we develop an assessment framework combining an agricultural management technology database and evaluate technology combinations for their potentials in NH3 emission reductions and consequent air quality and ecosystem benefits for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region. Results show that BTH agricultural NH3 emissions can be reduced by up to 57% (274 Gg of N per year) in 2019. With maximum feasible NH3 reduction (57%), annual PM2.5 concentrations and nitrogen deposition in BTH can be reduced by up to 7% and 13%, respectively, which are more significant than the effects of halving local anthropogenic NOx emissions. When combining NH3 and NOx emission reductions, the effects of NH3 controls on PM2.5 mitigation will be suppressed while facilitating more efficient local nitrogen deposition mitigation. Our findings implicate that technically feasible NH3 emission reductions are still useful for current PM2.5 management and nitrogen deposition mitigation. In the near future, with continuous NOx controls, additional NH3 controls are required to further mitigate nitrogen deposition in BTH, while associated air quality benefits would depend nonlinearly upon the levels of NH3 and NOx emission reductions."

Physicochemical properties of PFAA are known to influence their toxicokinetics in mammals, but mechanistic models capable of identifying the key drivers of absorption, distribution, and elimination are limited. Here, we develop and evaluate a physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) model parameterized to an in vivo mouse model using data from in vitro studies. We simulated tissue concentrations of 9 PFAA with perfluorinated carbon chains (ηpfc) ranging from 4 to 10 in wild-type mice, and for perfluorooctanesulfonic acid in knockout mice, following intravenous and oral exposures. The PBTK model quantifies blood flow, binding to tissue proteins and phospholipids, membrane permeability, hepatic and renal transporters, and fecal and urinary excretion. Model evaluation comparing experimental and simulated mice blood and tissue concentrations showed R2 values of ≥ 0.65 and relative root-mean-square errors of ≤ 122% for most PFAA. Model sensitivity analyses showed that permeability and phospholipid binding strongly influenced the elimination and distribution of long-chain PFAA (ηpfc ≥ 7), while elimination for short-chain PFAA (ηpfc ≤ 6) was more sensitive to renal transporters and albumin binding. This study illustrates how integrating in vitro-derived parameters into PBTK models enables mechanistic evaluation of PFAS toxicokinetics across diverse compounds and physiological conditions."

Dissolved organic matter (DOM) turnover plays an important role in controlling the stability of soil aggregates, affecting aggregate formation and microbial activity. Microplastics (MPs) are known to impact soil DOM composition and structure, but their effects on DOM transformation in different soil aggregates remain unclear. Herein, we conducted 450 day incubation assays to study the effects of nondegradable and biodegradable MPs with varying aging levels on DOM transformations in agricultural soil aggregates. MPs were found to increase DOM transformation in soil aggregates, leading to changes in soil aggregate stability, including a reduction in geometric mean diameter and mass-weighted diameter. The addition of MPs resulted in a decrease in the stability of DOM in large-sized aggregates but an increase in the aromaticity and unsaturation of DOM in small-sized aggregates, which were more pronounced in the PLAMPs-treated group. This phenomenon is primarily attributed to the transformation of unsaturated aliphatic compounds and highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds, which play a major role in the intra- and intergroup transformation of DOM. In this process, microbial communities play a significant role. They tend to consume DOM in larger aggregates and produce DOM in smaller aggregates, leading to an accumulation of DOM in smaller aggregates, thereby promoting the formation of smaller aggregates and reducing the aggregate stability. This study uncovers the mechanisms of DOM transformation in response to MPs in soil aggregates, providing a scientific basis for soil management and sustainable agricultural development."

With the chloramine formation assay, the total reactive amines were quantified for the main subgroups. An assay with continuous ozonation quantified three types of reactive amines based on nitrate formation rate constants (kNO3-): kNO3- < 0.1 M–1 s–1 for secondary and aliphatic primary amines; kNO3- = 0.9–1.9 M–1 s–1 for aryl-type primary amines; kNO3- = 15–110 M–1 s–1 for amino acids and peptidic amino groups. The analysis of 15N/14N ratios of nitrate helped to distinguish reactive amines based on 15N enrichment factors (εN): aliphatic (or aryl-type) primary amines (εN:-9 to -3‰), and amino acids and peptidic amino groups (εN:-28 to -19‰). Overall, 23–27% of the organic nitrogen in DOM isolates comprises oxidant-reactive amines, with 5–6% secondary amines, 10–14% aliphatic primary amines, 4% aryl-type primary amines, 1–4% amino acids, and 0–2% peptidic amino groups.

The results indicate that coal’s sulfur content and usage of certain APCDs promote the formation of p-SO42–, including selective catalytic reduction (SCR), wet flue gas desulfurization (WFGD), and semidry desulfurization (SDD), whereas the wet electrostatic precipitator (WESP) and desulfurization efficiency inhibit it.

Traditional NPF event classification schemes in the literature, primarily through visual inspection of particle number size distributions, are subjective, time-consuming, and laborious. Here, we introduced a fast object detection deep learning algorithm, You Only Look Once (YOLO), for the first time to detect NPF events. We used more than one year of asynchronous particle number size distribution data from 20 diverse geographical locations globally. The YOLO algorithm was first trained and validated using a small subset of manually annotated 252 NPF events and 195 non-events (approximately 25 images from each measurement site). The trained YOLO algorithm was then evaluated to detect NPF events against the remaining 6462 observation days across all measurement sites. The performance metrics of the trained YOLO algorithm revealed high precision and accuracy in detecting NPF events. The model accuracy for each measurement site was calculated by taking the ratio of the total number of NPF events detected by the trained YOLO algorithm at a confidence score (CoS) > 0.1 to the total number of visually identified NPF events. Considering all measurement sites, the trained YOLO algorithm’s accuracy (in fraction) for detecting NPF events ranged from 0.74 to 0.97 at a CoS > 0.1, although the accuracy decreased with increasing threshold CoS. This work underscores the efficacy and robustness of the YOLO algorithm and demonstrates its applicability in accurately detecting NPF events in diverse environmental conditions worldwide."

Qingdao is a coastal city in eastern China, located in the Asian continental outflow, where iron constitutes one of the major mineral species in fine particles (PM2.5). Using positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis of PM2.5 composition data (139 samples collected during the spring of 2017 and 2018) from Qingdao, we quantified the sources of total iron (FeT) and its water-soluble fraction (i.e., FeS) and the iron solubility (%FeS = FeS/FeT×100%) enhancement mechanisms. Our results revealed that while mineral dust contributed 71.1% of FeT, anthropogenic sources dominated FeS, accounting for 63.6% of FeS. During dust events, aged dust particles contributed about half of the FeS, with %FeS enhanced by up to 2.2-fold through atmospheric aging processes. In non-dust periods, anthropogenic sources accounted for 84.8% of FeS, with the %FeS mainly modulated by ship emissions, secondary aerosols, and aging of industrial particles. Notably, ship emissions exhibited exceptionally high %FeS, while secondary processes involving organic ligands and acid-processed industrial aerosols significantly enhanced %FeS. These findings quantitatively demonstrate the significance of anthropogenic air pollutants and secondary processes in FeS occurrence in Asian continental outflow, with important implications for understanding iron biogeochemical cycling in downwind marine ecosystems."

In this study we investigated when and where abrupt shifts occur in the latest generation of earth system models (CMIP6) under a scenario of 1% annual increase in CO2. We considered 82 ocean, atmosphere, and land variables across 57 models. We used a Canny edge detection method to identify abrupt shifts occurring on yearly to decadal timescales, and performed a connected component analysis to quantify the spatial extent of these shifts. The systems analyzed include the North Atlantic subpolar gyre, Tibetan Plateau, land permafrost, Amazon rainforest, Antarctic sea ice, monsoon systems, Arctic summer sea ice, Arctic winter sea ice, and Barents sea ice. Except for the monsoon systems, we found abrupt shifts in all of these across multiple models.

A number of studies have observationally quantified eddy effects, but most of these have focused on the diffusivity of passive tracers (Solomon‐Redi diffusivity). However, passive tracer diffusivity is not directly informative about the quasi‐Stokes transport, since this requires estimates of the buoyancy diffusivity (also known as the Gent‐McWilliams diffusivity). Here we obtain the first global observational estimates of the quasi‐Stokes transport, assuming that mesoscale eddies diffuse potential vorticity (PV) rather than buoyancy. These are also used to estimate the corresponding buoyancy diffusivity, which is what is needed in coarse‐resolution ocean models employing the Gent‐McWilliams parameterization.

However, a lack of in situ measurements limits the validation and incorporation of anisotropy, so most ice flow models assume isotropic ice. Especially observations of anisotropy in fast‐flowing ice streams are scarce. Here, we present an assessment of anisotropic ice fabric inside a fast‐flowing Greenlandic ice stream. Seismic anisotropy, measured through shear wave splitting in basal icequakes, reveals an anisotropic horizontal cone fabric. The corresponding fabric tensor suggests that ice likely deforms at least seven times easier along‐flow than across‐flow. The presence of such a strong anisotropic fabric within the fast‐flowing ice stream emphasizes that assuming isotropic fabric in ice flow models likely introduces significant inaccuracies. Furthermore, variations between our observations and measurements from other regions highlight the necessity of comprehensive in situ data to better understand spatial variations in ice anisotropy and how fabrics develop."

This pattern was corroborated by field data from Korean coastal macroalgal habitats and Yellow Sea macroalgal blooms. Contrary to the conventional view that macroalgal decomposition primarily releases CO2, over half of the inorganic carbon is released as HCO3− in oxygenated waters. This bicarbonate surge—potentially driven by sulfate reduction in anoxic macroalgal aggregates or intracellular HCO3− release—not only raises seawater alkalinity but also enhances carbon sequestration potential and mitigates ocean acidification.

On Earth, normalized channel belt width decreases approaching the coastline and drops sharply at the start of the backwater zone. This systematic decrease allows a backwater/belt‐width window to be defined, one backwater length upstream from the coast with normalized widths from 2 to 6. We use the backwater/belt‐width window to interpret backwater morphodynamics and estimate backwater length on Mars using narrowing channel belts at Aeolis Dorsa. We measure nine belts from martian delta deposits and compare normalized width to distance upstream from an ancient shoreline. Estimates range from ∼5 to 17 km, coinciding with lengths derived from avulsions. Observing these relationships on Mars demonstrates the universality of backwater morphodynamics, providing new methods for understanding martian hydrologic history.

Using a hierarchy of climate model ensembles, we find that the decline in AMOC, and its SST fingerprint within the North Atlantic warming hole region, are sensitive to external forcing level and wind driven ocean forcing. Once external forcing reaches a level at which sea ice melt increases the Labrador Sea vertical salinity gradient, localized cooling and resulting expansion of the sea ice edge decrease vertical mechanical stirring. Under greenhouse gas only forcing, this mechanism plays a large role and under SSP3.70 forcing, it plays a relatively minor role due to larger buoyancy forcing.

 Aromatic rings, also known as arenes, containing two or more adjacent different substituents are ubiquitously found in small molecule drugs1. Strategies that can rapidly introduce diverse vicinal substituents to readily available precursors would greatly benefit generation of analogues of bioactive compounds2, which, however, remain challenging to realize to date. The existing approaches for preparing vicinal difunctionalized arenes lack modularity, or regioselectivity, or generality. Here we report a nickel-catalyzed vicinal diborylation method that can directly install two chemically differentiated boryl groups in a regio- and site-selective manner using readily available aryl triflates or chlorides as substrates. This reaction operates under simple and mild conditions and is scalable. It also shows a broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. Given that each boryl group can be independently transformed into various functional groups, this method offers a modular, regioselective, and divergent approach to access diverse vicinal difunctionalized arenes, showing promise for constructing analogue libraries. The combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies reveal a highly unusual reaction pathway, involving the formation of a dearomatized gem-diboryl species and 1,2-boron migration. The site- and regioselectivity of this reaction are proposed to be controlled by steric interactions of the boryl groups with the nickel catalyst. The mechanistic insights gained in this investigation could have broad implications on developing other boron-mediated functionalization reactions."

 Cropland expansion has been the most notable change in global land use since industrialization. However, assessments of radiative forcing from land-use change have generally neglected the effects of cropland expansion on secondary organic aerosol. Here we perform a series of cropland expansion sensitivity experiments with an Earth system model that incorporates advanced secondary organic aerosol processes, including organic new particle formation. Our model results show an ~ 10% decrease in biogenic secondary organic aerosol burden due to cropland expansion since industrialization. This has reduced radiation scattering and cloud droplet formation associated with secondary organic aerosol, leading to a 146 ± 112 mW m−2 decline in its radiative cooling forcing, equivalent to 8% of CO2-induced radiative warming forcing since industrialization. The radiative impact is mainly attributed to the transition from evergreen and deciduous broadleaf forests to croplands. The radiative impacts are projected to increase by approximately 50% under future climate warming and reduced anthropogenic aerosol and precursor gas emissions, due to changes in biogenic emission intensity and background cloud condensation nuclei concentration. Policies addressing food security and climate change should account for the radiative impact of biogenic secondary organic aerosol from cropland expansion. Model simulations suggest that cropland expansion since industrialization has reduced atmospheric biogenic secondary organic aerosol by 10% and its associated radiative cooling effect by 11%."

 The estimation of low energies of many-body systems is a cornerstone of the computational quantum sciences. Variational quantum algorithms can be used to prepare ground states on pre-fault-tolerant quantum processors, but their lack of convergence guarantees and impractical number of cost function estimations prevent systematic scaling of experiments to large systems. Alternatives to variational approaches are needed for large-scale experiments on pre-fault-tolerant devices. Here, we use a superconducting quantum processor to compute eigenenergies of quantum many-body systems on two-dimensional lattices of up to 56 sites, using the Krylov quantum diagonalization algorithm, an analog of the well-known classical diagonalization technique. We construct subspaces of the many-body Hilbert space using Trotterized unitary evolutions executed on the quantum processor, and classically diagonalize many-body interacting Hamiltonians within those subspaces. These experiments demonstrate exponential convergence towards an estimate of the ground state energy, and show that quantum diagonalization algorithms are poised to complement their classical counterparts at the foundation of computational methods for quantum systems.

Here, Ghiasi et al. combine graphene with CrPS4 and detect quantum spin Hall states at zero magnetic field. 
 A promising approach to attain long-distance coherent spin propagation is accessing topological spin-polarized edge states in graphene. Achieving this without external magnetic fields necessitates engineering graphene band structure, obtainable through proximity effects in van der Waals heterostructures. In particular, proximity-induced staggered potentials and spin-orbit coupling are expected to form a topological bulk gap in graphene with gapless helical edge states that are robust against disorder. In this work, we detect the spin-polarized helical edge transport in graphene at zero external magnetic field, allowed by the proximity of an interlayer antiferromagnet, CrPS4. We show the coexistence of the quantum spin Hall (QSH) states and magnetism in graphene, where the induced spin-orbit and exchange couplings also give rise to a large anomalous Hall (AH) effect. The detection of the QSH states at zero external magnetic field, together with the AH signal that persists up to room temperature, opens the route for practical applications of magnetic graphene in quantum spintronic circuitries. Graphene was one of the first materials proposed to host the quantum spin Hall effect.

 Little is known about the genetic connection system and community organization of Late Neolithic and Early Copper Age populations of the Carpathian Basin. Here, we present a comprehensive genetic investigation of these populations, leveraging whole genome data from 125 individuals. Using population genetics, kinship analyses and the study of networks of identity-by-descent haplotype segment sharing, we elucidate the social and genetic dynamics of these communities between 4800−3900 calibrated years BCE. Despite changes in settlement patterns, burial practices, and material culture, we document a high degree of genetic continuity. While one set of individuals from a large community cemetery is genetically diverse, another site is more homogenous and closed, with numerous consanguineous relationships and evidence of patrilineality and patrilocality.

Here, the authors identify a role for apolipoprotein M in AMD that may present a therapeutic target. 
 Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness in people over 50. AMD and cardiovascular disease share risk factors including age, impaired lipid metabolism, and extracellular lipid deposition. Because of its importance in age-related diseases, we hypothesize that apolipoprotein M (ApoM), a lipocalin that binds sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), might restore lipid homeostasis and retinal function in AMD. In support, we find that human patients with AMD demonstrate significantly reduced ApoM compared to controls. In mice with impaired retinal cholesterol efflux, ApoM improves retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) function and lipotoxicity in an S1P- and S1P receptor 3-dependent manner. Ultrastructural evidence of enhanced melanosome-lipid droplet interactions led us to hypothesize and demonstrate that ApoM-S1P signaling drives RPE-specific lysosomal lipid catabolism. RPE-specific knockout of lysosomal acid lipase recapitulates features of AMD. Our study defines a novel role for ApoM/S1P signaling in AMD driven by RPE lipotoxicity, mediated by cell-autonomous lysosomal lipid catabolism.

 The development of non-human primate models is essential for the fields of developmental and regenerative biology because those models will more closely approximate human biology than do murine models. Based on single cell RNAseq and fluorescence-activated cell sorting, we report the identification and functional characterization of two quiescent stem cell populations (skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs) and mesenchymal stem cells termed fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs)) in the non-human primate Microcebus murinus (the gray mouse lemur). We demonstrate in vivo proliferation, differentiation, and self-renewal of both MuSCs and FAPs. By combining cell phenotyping with cross-species molecular profiling and pharmacological interventions, we show that mouse lemur MuSCs and FAPs are more similar to human than to mouse counterparts. We identify unexpected gene targets involved in regulating primate MuSC proliferation and primate FAP adipogenic differentiation. Moreover, we find that the cellular composition of mouse lemur muscle better models human muscle than does macaque (Macaca fascicularis) muscle. Finally, we note that our approach presents as a generalizable pipeline for the identification, isolation, and characterization of stem cell populations in new animal models.

 Avoiding severe global warming requires large-scale removals of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Forest regeneration offers cost-effective carbon removals, but annual rates vary substantially by location and forest age. Here we generate grid-level (~1-km2) growth curves for aboveground live carbon in naturally regrowing forests by combining 109,708 field estimates with 66 environmental covariates. Across the globe and the first 100 years of growth, maximum carbon removal rates varied 200-fold, with the greatest rates estimated in ~20- to 40-year-old forests. Despite a focus on new forests for natural climate solutions, protecting existing young secondary forests can provide up to 8-fold more carbon removal per hectare than new regrowth. These maps could help to target the optimal ages and locations where a key carbon removal strategy could be applied, and improve estimates of how secondary forests contribute to global carbon cycling.

 Irrigation expansion has been promoted as a way to improve global nutrition and health by increasing food production and income. However, its impact on the health and nutrition of local communities is unclear and might vary substantially across contexts, depending on who reaps the benefits and how. Here we combine georeferenced survey data from 9,144 rural communities (70,817 households) across 26 global south countries with data on global patterns of irrigation infrastructure changes to examine linkages between irrigation expansion and local changes in child diet diversity—a key indicator of micronutrient intake and development. We found a positive link between irrigation and child diet diversity, with substantial regional differences. Irrigation benefits were concentrated in regions without sufficient water resources to support it, suggesting trade-offs between dietary improvements and water stress. By contrast, irrigated areas with sufficient water tend to produce higher fractions of cash crops and export-oriented food items, with weaker associations to improved local diets. These findings suggest that while irrigation access is associated with overall improvements of child diet diversity in rural communities, water stress conditions can influence these outcomes. Nutrition-sensitive strategies thus need to be considered as an essential component of sustainable irrigation planning in the future. Irrigation is an important component of agricultural productivity, but its influence on health and nutritional outcomes—especially those of children—remains unclear.

 Pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) are among the deadliest manifestations of volcanic eruptions, commonly associated with volcanoes characterized by intermediate to felsic magma compositions and related to eruption column collapse, lateral blasts, or gravitational failures of lava-domes. However, even basaltic, small-moderate eruptions have recently generated potentially lethal PDCs. We analyzed the PDC from the lava fountain of 10 February 2022 at Mt. Etna’s South East Crater. We integrated field, remote sensing and petrological data on the PDC products, together with video-recordings of the eruptive activity and numerical modeling to evaluate its propagation dynamics. Our analysis suggests that hot, altered portions of steep volcanic edifices may collapse and remobilize large amounts of deposits, constituting precursors of highly mobile granular flows. Monitoring their pre-eruptive trigger conditions continuously is therefore crucial for a robust assessment of the potential hazard, especially in the proximal areas of very active basaltic volcanoes frequented by numerous tourists.

 Wildfires can dramatically alter water quality, resulting in severe implications for human and freshwater systems. However, regional-scale assessments of these impacts are often limited by data scarcity. Here, we unify observations from 1984–2021 in 245 burned watersheds across the western United States, comparing post-fire signals to baseline levels from 293 unburned basins. Organic carbon and phosphorus exhibit significantly elevated levels (p ≤ 0.05) in the first 1–5 years post-fire, while nitrogen and sediment show significant increases up to 8 years post-fire. During peak post-fire response years, average carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations are 3–103 times pre-fire levels, and sediment 19–286 times pre-fire concentrations. Higher responses are linked with greater forested and developed areas, which respectively explain up to 31 and 33% of inter-basin response variability. Overall, this analysis provides strong evidence of multi-year water quality degradation following wildfires in the western United States and highlights the influence of basin and wildfire features. These insights may aid water managers in preparation efforts, increasing resilience of water systems to wildfire impacts. Water quality in the western United States is affected by wildfires, with sediment and turbidity levels increasing up to 8 years post-fire, according to an analysis of sediment, dissolved organic matter, and nutrients in 538 watersheds."

 Urban greenspaces are widely recognized as an effective nature-based strategy to mitigate urban heat. However, previous studies have often oversimplified the cooling process of greenspaces, leaving their cumulative cooling effect insufficiently quantified. To address this gap, we developed a novel three-dimensional (3D) quantitative model to evaluate spatially accumulated cooling benefits. A total of 668 greenspace patches across 37 cities globally, representing varying climatic conditions, were selected. We then tested the relative importance of intrinsic drivers (landscape composition and spatial configuration) versus built environment drivers (landscape patterns of surrounding areas) in explaining the cooling effect. The results indicate that greenspaces provide an average cumulative cooling effect of 4.92 °C on the surrounding land surface temperature (LST), with a maximum reduction of up to 25.3 °C, far exceeding expectations. The cooling effect is primarily and positively influenced by patch area, the intrinsic green-blue proportion, and surrounding socioeconomic characteristics. More importantly, we emphasize the necessity of an accumulated perspective in the threshold value of efficiency (TVoE) assessments, as existing quantitative frameworks tend to largely underestimate the cooling benefits of large greenspaces. Our analysis reveals a U-shaped relationship between the aridity index and TVoE. To maximize cumulative cooling efficiency, optimal greenspace areas were identified as 2.25 ha for arid cities, 1.48 ha for semi-arid cities, 1.64 ha for dry sub-humid cities, and 1.8 ha for humid cities. This work opens new avenues for quantifying cumulative cooling effect from a 3D perspective, which may also scientifically inform urban greenspace planning and climate adaptation strategies."

 Frequency decomposition offers a promising approach for hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) by separating anomalies from redundant backgrounds. However, an improper decomposition strategy may cause domain shifts in the low-frequency component (LFC) and excessive suppression of the high-frequency component (HFC), ultimately affecting detection performance. To address those challenges, we propose a novel frequency decomposition framework wavelet-enhanced diffusion framework for HAD, termed as WDHAD. Following a 2D discrete wavelet transformation, the LFC and HFC are processed in parallel: 1) The LFC is handled via a Low-Frequency Diffusion Model (LFDM), which employs a Low-Frequency Denoising Autoencoder (LFDAE) with spatial-frequency attention to recover key features and remove background noise. 2) The HFC is processed through a High-Frequency Enhancement Module (HFEM) that preserves edges and textures to improve anomaly detection. Both components are then fused and passed through a 2D inverse wavelet transformation, with the detection map obtained by a Reed-Xiaoli detector. In addition, a negative log-likelihood noise loss is introduced to model uncertainty. Extensive experiments on six public and two real-world UAV datasets demonstrate that WDHAD achieves robust generalization and cross-domain adaptability.

 Data-driven models applied to landslide prediction have historically been mostly confined to the pure spatial context, as per landslide susceptibility requirements. Its standard definition assumes that the occurrence probability is conditional on a broad set of static predictors and that in turn, it does not change with time. To find data-driven models where the probability is temporally dynamic, we need to explore early-warning systems. However, these models traditionally rely only upon rainfall (intensity-duration characteristics) and neglect influences from terrain, geological, and other thematic contributors. Space-time data-driven models can incorporate both static and dynamic predictors, allowing for a rich description of the landslide process and for the susceptibility to change both in space and time. In this work, we present an overview of potential variations of space–time landslide susceptibility models for an area in Chongqing, China. In doing so, we present space–time models suited for long-term (yearly or seasonal models) or short-term (monthly or daily) planning. Therefore, the manuscript presents elements of a review as well as elements of methodological innovation.

 Existing remote sensing techniques provide insights into the global-scale daily distribution of tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) vertical column densities (VCDs). However, they struggle to quantify the diurnal variation of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, crucial for understanding air quality and atmospheric environment. We present a novel mass-conserving inversion method and sampling strategy that uses the overlap between adjacent swath edges of polar orbiting satellite Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI to quantify five years (May 2018 to April 2023) of global diurnal NOx emissions over upper mid-latitude regions. We account for first-order thermodynamics, chemical decay, and advective and pressure induced transport, allowing a flexible, rapid, and reliable alternative to complex models. By sampling two daytime NO2 VCDs across consecutive orbits approximately 100 min apart, emissions rates are computed for both the 100-min window around midday as well as the 24-h daily cycle. Robust climatological estimates and uncertainty quantification are enabled over major urban areas like New York, Benelux, North China Plain, and Almaty. The estimated diurnal emissions variation show that 100-min emissions are 21 %–105 % higher than 24-h averages, which reveals differences in chemical lifetime from different energy sources, unique spatial-temporal weekend effects over China, USA, and Europe, and see-saw of emissions underestimation over cleaner regions and improvement over polluted regions.

 Delhi-National Capital Region (Delhi-NCR) suffers from adverse air quality particularly during the winter season, thereby affecting climate, health, and economic activities, warranting the need for information on key species, sources and atmospheric pathways causing intense particulate pollution. Using over one month (February–March) of sub-micron particle (PM1) chemical composition data and κ-Köhler theory at a Delhi background site, we estimate that the water uptake ability of both PM1 (kappa, κ = 0.52 ± 0.10) and its organic component (κOA = 0.22 ± 0.04) during the late winter season are almost twice as that of global average for continental aerosols. Our results indicate that apart from previously identified ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), the semi-volatile oxygenated organic aerosols (SVOOA) directly increase the PM1 water uptake ability, and undergo co-condensation with water vapor under high RH and low temperature conditions during early morning hours, thereby increasing the cloud condensation nuclei counts (CCN vs SVOOA, linear correlation R = 0.81) and total PM1 mass (CCN vs PM1, R = 0.88) in the Delhi region. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) results of both gas and particle phase organics suggest that semi-volatile oxygenated organic compounds were mainly associated with solid-fuel and traffic-related combustion emissions, whereas correlation with source-specific tracers suggest non-combustion emissions for NH4Cl. Results suggest that semi-volatile oxygenated organic compounds produced from the photochemical oxidation of organics emitted from combustion activities likely undergo gas-to-particle partitioning in the evening and aqueous phase processing at night, leading to enhanced SOA formation, CCN and PM1 mass."

 Three years (2021 – 2023) of in-situ ground-based observations from a high-altitude site in Western Ghats, India, have been utilized to study the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation and closure during the monsoon (JJAS, June to September), including its transition periods (May and October). Aerosol-CCN characteristics showed an apparent temporal variation between monsoon and its transition periods. The estimated aerosol bulk hygroscopicity (κ) showed a narrow (broad) distribution during monsoon (transition periods). Aitken mode was dominant during JJAS, while Aitken-accumulation mode was dominant during the transition periods, suggesting that these modes primarily control the bulk hygroscopicity of the total aerosol population. These further indicate the increased wet scavenging of larger aerosol particles during JJAS compared to transition periods. The CCN closure study was performed using different κ values. The analysis showed a good closure in JJAS when κ = 0.15 was considered, while the transition periods showed a good closure at various κ and supersaturation (SS) values. This suggests that the CCN closure is less sensitive to the change in SS or κ during JJAS than the transition periods. Hence, the assumption of a single κ (e.g., κ = 0.15) or a narrow range of κ (= 0.15 – 0.20) can be considered during monsoon, while the same assumption cannot be applied during the transition periods for the study region.

Mid-level humidity was reduced by dry air transported from the Sahara Desert toward southern Italy.Numerical simulations with a mesoscale model show that it is possible to produce a simulated windstorm with a trajectory and evolution like the real one. The genesis of the downburst was favored by some mesoscale meteorological features: the cold and dry low-level air following a cold front reduced the convective inhibition and initiated convection over the Ionian Sea, while the unidirectional wind profile favored the possibility of downburst development.

 A large spread exists in future precipitation projections based on climate models, particularly at regional scales, and efforts are needed to reduce uncertainties for effective regional adaptation strategies. Using outputs of 27 CMIP6 models, this study investigates uncertainties in mean and extreme precipitation projections over China. It is shown that uncertainties in the fractional change of mean precipitation are proportional to the magnitude of projected changes, being higher in the northwest and lower in the southeast, while extreme precipitation exhibits a more uniform spatial distribution. An analysis of uncertainty decomposition reveals that internal variability dominates short-term projection uncertainty, particularly for extreme precipitation. By the end of the 21st century, model uncertainty emerges as the largest contributor to mean precipitation uncertainty and accounts for more than one-third of extreme precipitation uncertainty. Optimal model selection method can reduce model uncertainty up to about 40 %, and it is more effective for mean precipitation than for extreme precipitation. Besides, the effectiveness of the method varies largely with the evaluation metrics and regions considered, emphasizing the need for metric-specific and region-specific model evaluations. These findings highlight the importance of tailored strategies to improve the reliability of future regional precipitation projections."

 The atmospheric melting layer (AML), where snow transitions into rain, influences satellite signals, precipitation remote sensing, and a range of hydro-meteorological applications. AML has been extensively studied using radar technology, but methods for continuous and consistent monitoring remain limited. This paper presents the first comprehensive review of AML research, with a focus on the Micro Rain Radar (MRR), a specialized precipitation profiler based on K-band frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar. We have organized the literature into four main themes: AML detection using MRR, comparisons with other instruments (e.g., radiosonde, scanning weather radar, satellite, and lidar) and reanalysis data, spatiotemporal variations in AML height, and methods for classifying precipitation event types (e.g., convective vs. stratiform). The in-depth critical review highlights strengths in the MRR's high temporal and spatial resolution, portability, and ability to continuously monitor precipitation microphysics. MRR provides multiple moments (e.g., reflectivity, and fall velocity) invaluable for AML studies, and their combination can enhance the consistency of AML detection, and event type classification. Nonetheless, limitations such as the single-polarization design, signal attenuation during heavy rainfall, and limited vertical range necessitate complementary datasets and advanced data processing techniques including artificial intelligence. Key findings underscore opportunities for gap filling and regionalization of AML observations, using mobile setups and multi-sensor campaigns. Also, modeling AML using surface weather variables can help link climate change studies and precipitation projections to anticipated AML behavior. The review concludes by outlining future directions and opportunities to advance AML research and applications."
