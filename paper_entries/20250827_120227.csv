10.5194/acp-25-9295-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了休斯顿-加尔维斯顿地区气溶胶对孤立深对流云的影响。研究利用TRACER实验的地面观测数据，量化了气溶胶浓度与对流云的回波顶高、强度和面积之间的关系。结果表明，气溶胶浓度增加对这些对流特性的影响有限，但在某些条件下，超细颗粒物可能使云顶高度增加约1公里。海风影响下的对流云表现出更强的气溶胶效应，但可能受到未考虑的因素（如边界层上升气流）的影响。总体而言，该研究关注气溶胶与云之间的相互作用，以及气溶胶对降水的影响，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测）密切相关。,"['aerosols', 'convection', 'precipitation', 'cloud properties', 'aerosol-cloud interactions', 'ground-based observations', 'air quality']",Dié Wang;Roni Kobrosly;Tao Zhang;Tamanna Subba;Susan van den Heever;Siddhant Gupta;Michael Jensen,Aerosol impacts on isolated deep convection:  findings from TRACER,"We aim to understand how tiny particles in the air, called aerosols, affect rain clouds in the Houston–Galveston area. More aerosols generally do not make these clouds grow much taller, with an average height increase of about 1 km. However, their effects on rainfall strength and cloud expansion are less certain. Clouds influenced by sea breezes show a stronger aerosol impact, possibly due to factors that are unaccounted for like vertical winds in near-surface layers. 
 This study focuses on quantifying the conditional relationship between aerosol and convective precipitation properties of isolated deep convective clouds (DCCs) in the Houston–Galveston region, after adjusting for confounding effects. We leverage comprehensive ground-based observations from the TRacking Aerosol Convection interactions ExpeRiment (TRACER) to estimate aerosol effects on convective echo top height (ETH), intensity, and area separately. Our results show that greater aerosol number concentrations generally have a limited impact on these convective properties, showing relationships consistent with the possibility of both invigoration and suppression effects. Under certain conditions, where ultrafine particles are abundant, aerosols exhibit a positive effect on ETH, increasing it by about 1 km. However, it is inevitable to consider measurement uncertainties and the limitations of temporal and spatial resolution in the data, as these factors can further contribute to uncertainties in our estimates. In DCCs associated with sea breezes, the estimated aerosol effects on DCCs are found to be more pronounced. However, this heightened effect could be attributed to the exclusion of key confounders such as boundary layer updrafts in the analysis."

Particle mass increased 300-fold as particles and gases became more oxidized. Light absorption increased, but the total direct radiative forcing efficiency was estimated to have shifted from positive to negative. The results highlight the importance of considering secondary aerosol formation when assessing the impacts of aviation. 
 Aviation is an important source of urban air pollution, but the impacts of photochemical processing on the exhaust emissions remain insufficiently characterized. Here, the physical–chemical properties of fresh and photochemically aged emissions from a laboratory-scale jet engine burner operated with JP-8 kerosene were studied in detail with a range of online and offline methods. The fresh emissions contained high amounts of organic matter present predominantly in the gaseous phase. Photochemical aging in an oxidation flow reactor caused substantial formation of oxidized organic aerosol, increasing the particle mass approximately 300-fold. During aging, aromatic hydrocarbons and alkanes in the gas-phase decayed, while gas-phase oxidation products, such as small carbonyls and oxygenated aromatics, increased. The composition of organic matter became more complex by photochemical processing, with the average particulate carbon oxidation state increasingly growing throughout the addressed exposure range (equivalent to 0.2 to 7 d in the atmosphere) with a ΔH:C/ΔO:C slope of −0.54. Simultaneously, the near-UV wavelength absorption by the particles increased due to enhanced particulate mass. The imaginary refractory indices of organic particulate matter were 0.0071 and 0.00013 at the wavelength of 520 nm for the fresh and photochemically processed particles, respectively, indicating secondary production of weakly absorbing brown carbon. The direct radiative forcing by the exhaust particles was estimated by a Mie model, which revealed a prominent shift from a warming to cooling climate effect upon photochemical aging. The results highlight the importance of considering secondary aerosol formation when assessing the environmental impacts of aviation."
10.5194/acp-25-9263-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注全球海洋大气中多环芳烃（PAHs）及其烷基化（RPAHs）、硝基化（NPAHs）和含氧化合物（OPAHs）的分布、来源和变化。通过分析从中国到南极的海洋气溶胶样本，确定了不同区域PAHs及其衍生物的浓度和主要来源。研究发现，东海和西太平洋主要受煤炭和发动机燃烧的影响，俾斯麦海和东澳大利亚海主要受野火和煤炭燃烧的影响，而南极海洋则主要受生物质燃烧和当地船舶排放的影响。虽然该研究没有直接提及遥感技术或卫星观测，但其对大气成分的分析和空气质量的监测具有重要意义，可以为相关遥感研究提供地面验证数据和背景信息，因此与大气环境遥感技术具有较强的相关性。,"['PAHs', 'RPAHs', 'NPAHs', 'OPAHs', 'marine atmosphere', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'source apportionment']",Rui Li;Xing Liu;Yubing Shen;Yumeng Shao;Yining Gao;Ziwei Yao;Xi Liu;Guitao Shi,"Measurement report: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their alkylated (RPAHs), nitrated (NPAHs), and oxygenated (OPAHs) derivatives in the global marine atmosphere – occurrence, spatial variations, and source apportionment","We reveal for the first time the global variations of PAHs and derivatives in marine air. We found that marine aerosols in East China Sea (ECS) and Western Pacific (WP) were significantly affected by coal and engine combustion, while those in Bismarck Sea (BS) and East Australian Sea (EAS) were mainly influenced by wildfire and coal combustion. The Antarctic Ocean (AO) was dominated by biomass burning and local shipping emissions. This finding helps elucidate the mechanism of the global PAH cycle. 
 Ambient polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their derivatives have severe adverse impacts on organism health and ecosystem safety. However, their global distributions, sources, and fate in marine aerosol remain poorly understood. To fill the knowledge gap, high-volume air samples were collected along a transect from China to Antarctica and analyzed for particulate PAHs and derivatives. The highest PAH concentrations in marine aerosols were observed in the Western Pacific (WP: 447±228pgm-3), followed by the East China Sea (ECS: 195 pg m−3), the Antarctic Ocean (AO: 111±91pgm-3), the East Australian Sea (EAS: 104±88pgm-3), and (the lowest) the Bismarck Sea (BS: 17±12pgm-3). Unexpectedly, PAH concentrations in the AO were even higher than those in the EAS and BS. This could be attributed to the relatively low anthropogenic PAH emissions from Australia and Papua New Guinea, whereas AO is often affected by emissions from engine combustion and biomass burning. In contrast to the distribution of PAHs, OPAH levels in the EAS were much higher than those in the AO. It was assumed that OPAHs mainly originated from the secondary formation of parent PAHs through reactions with O3 and OH radicals, both of which are more prevalent in the EAS.  Several source apportionment models suggested that PAHs and their derivatives in marine aerosol are dominated by three sources: coal burning and engine combustion emissions (56 %), wood and biomass burning (30 %), and secondary formation (14 %). Specifically, marine aerosols in the ECS and WP were significantly affected by coal burning and engine combustion, while those in the BS and EAS were mainly influenced by wildfire and coal combustion.  AO was primarily dominated by biomass burning and local shipping emissions."

Prevot;Konstantinos Eleftheriadis,Implementation of real-time source apportionment approaches using the ACSM–Xact–Aethalometer (AXA) setup with SoFi RT: the Athens case study,"Air pollution from airborne particles is a major health and environmental concern, especially in cities. Understanding the particles' sources is key to addressing this issue, but traditional methods require time-consuming sampling, delaying action. Our study introduces a real-time monitoring system that uses advanced instruments and software to track pollution instantly. This technology allows faster, more precise pollution analysis, helping cities create targeted strategies to improve air quality. 
 Air pollution, particularly from particulate matter (PM), poses serious public health and environmental risks, especially in urban areas. To address this, accurate source apportionment (SA) of PM is essential for effective air quality management. Traditional SA approaches often rely on offline data collection, limiting timely responses to pollution events. SA applied on data from online techniques, especially with high temporal resolution, is advantageous over offline techniques, enabling the study of the diurnal variability of emission sources and also the study of specific events. Recent technological advancements now enable real-time SA, allowing continuous, detailed analysis of pollution sources. This study presents the first application of the ACSM–Xact–Aethalometer (AXA) setup integrated with SoFi RT software for real-time source apportionment of PM in Athens, Greece. The AXA setup integrates chemical, elemental, and black carbon (BC) data streams, covering a broad spectrum of PM components and capturing a comprehensive representation of PM sources in an urban environment. SoFi RT handles data from the AXA instruments as separate inputs within a single matrix, placing them in distinct diagonal blocks. Each main instrument's data (ACSM, Xact) is processed independently, with the model applying instrument-specific constraints and generating separate source factors, effectively performing two parallel source apportionments in a single run of the ME-2 solver. Equivalent sources identified across the two instruments are then combined post-analysis to provide a unified interpretation of source contributions. The apportionment of BC to BCsf and BClf (solid fuel and liquid fuel) can be performed in either of the main instrument experiments and does not require dedicated processing. The results demonstrate that traffic-related emissions are the largest contributors to PM, with significant contributions from secondary species such as sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and secondary organic aerosols, which together accounted for approximately 57 % of the PM mass. Primary sources such as biomass burning and cooking contributed around 10 % each, with natural sources like dust and sea salt comprising the remainder. The SoFi RT software is employed for continuous SA, offering automated analysis of PM sources in near real time (minutes after the measurements). Our findings demonstrate that this setup effectively identifies major pollution sources. This work underscores the AXA system's potential for advancing urban air quality monitoring and informs targeted interventions to reduce PM pollution."

 In this work, we describe the development of the Carbon monOxide Measurement from Ames (COMA) instrument for measurement of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) aboard NASA's WB-57 high-altitude research aircraft. While COMA has previously flown in the cabin of the NASA P3 platform, here the instrument was modified to operate in a significantly different environment – an unpressurized pallet flying primarily above 12 km (40 000 ft). Modifications were made to the laser to allow for detection of CO and N2O, ruggedization and thermal management were addressed, and a calibration system was designed to quantify the measurement stability in-flight. Testing was conducted in a thermal vacuum chamber to mimic anticipated ambient conditions experienced inside the WB-57 pallet bay and found that the electronic components remained within the thermal limits. COMA was operated successfully during 9 unattended transit flights to and from South Korea and 15 research flights during NASA's Asian summer monsoon Chemical & CLImate Project (ACCLIP) 2022 campaign, which was focused on studying the Asian summer monsoon anticyclone in the western Pacific. The CO measurement has an overall uncertainty ranging between 4.1 ppb (at 50 ppb CO) and 5.6 ppb (at 200 ppb CO). N2O has an overall uncertainty of 2.7 ppb (at 320 ppb N2O). In addition, COMA observations were compared with two other in situ CO instruments co-located on the WB-57: the Carbon Monoxide Laser Detector 2 (COLD2) and the Airborne Carbonic Oxides and Sulfide Spectrometer (ACOS). Comparisons for the 15 flights during the ACCLIP campaign indicate ranges in slope of 1.10–1.15 for COLD2 vs. COMA and 0.94–1.10 for ACOS vs. COMA."

It combines high-accuracy microwave and high-resolution infrared observations for retrieving daily precipitation, a respective sampling uncertainty for a more robust analysis, and monthly means. It is intended and suitable for climate monitoring and research and allows studies on water management, agriculture, and disaster risk reduction. A continuous extension from 2023 onwards will be implemented in 2025. 
 Here, we introduce the first version of the Global Interpolated RAinFall Estimation (GIRAFE v1), the first dedicated global climate data record for precipitation by the Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) of the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT). GIRAFE is based on precipitation rate estimates obtained from observations by a variety of passive microwave (PMW) radiometers on board low-Earth orbit satellites and related retrieval algorithms and frequent and highly resolved infrared observations from geostationary satellites covering all longitudes and used at latitudes below 55° N/S. At higher latitudes, only the PMW-based precipitation rates are utilised. GIRAFE v1 is available globally at 1° resolution as daily accumulations and monthly means for the years 2002–2022, with an implementation of continuous production planned for 2025 onwards. The daily product is accompanied by a dedicated sampling uncertainty estimate based on decorrelation scales in space and time in infrared-based instantaneous precipitation fields. The methods for the generation of GIRAFE v1 are described in detail, followed by the results of quality assessment and intercomparison activities. GIRAFE v1 reproduces reference datasets with a performance similar to that of established precipitation products, especially those that are – like GIRAFE v1 – not adjusted to ground-based observations. Likewise, GIRAFE v1 proves to be suitable for the analysis of regional precipitation extremes, e.g. in their relation to sea surface temperatures. The main objective in the production of GIRAFE v1 is climate applications, for which we find the dataset highly suitable according to the stability and homogeneity analysis. The GIRAFE v1 data record is hosted by CM SAF and is freely available at https://doi.org/10.5676/EUM_SAF_CM/GIRAFE/V001 (Niedorf et al., 2024a)."

The data reveal seasonal and interannual isotope variability in a monsoon-influenced mid-latitude region, reflecting moisture sources and atmospheric circulation. This integrated isotope dataset supports evaluation of isotope-enabled climate models, advances hydroclimate research in East Asia, and is openly available for the Earth system science community. 
 Precipitation stable isotopes are critical tracers for understanding climate variabilities and the hydrological cycles, as they enable the tracing of moisture sources, air mass mixing, and evaporation-condensation mechanisms. In mid-latitude regions such as South Korea, which are influenced by tropical and extratropical circulation, highly resolved and long-term isotope records remain scarce. Here, we analyze stable isotopes in precipitation collected bi-weekly in Seoul, South Korea, from 2016 to 2020. The oxygen isotope ratios (δ18O) ranged widely from 1.15 to –18.21 ‰, deuterium (δ2H) ratios varied from 3.3 to –132.0 ‰, and the 17O-excess ranged from 69 to –28 ‰. All three primary isotopes exhibited a coherent sinusoidal seasonal cycle, with the most depleted values in winter, gradual enrichment through spring, and sharp depletion during the summer monsoon, reflecting the combined influence of temperature and the amount effect. The deuterium excess (d‑excess) was highest during cold, dry months and lowest in humid, rainy months, reflecting shifts in relative humidity and kinetic fractionation. Meanwhile, 17O-excess (Δ17O) exhibited a similar season trend with a smaller amplitude, suggesting that, beyond its known dependence on relative humidity and kinetic fractionation, it is also modulated by large‑scale transport and water vapor mixing. The local meteoric water line closely matches the global line but winter samples show a higher intercept and a slightly steeper δ17O–δ18O slope, suggesting enhanced kinetic fractionation under continental air masses. A consistently negative δ18O–Δ17O relationship was observed except in winter when it weakened. This integrated analysis of δ18O, d‑excess, and Δ17O provides a comprehensive picture of source humidity, transport dynamics, and seasonal precipitation processes in a mid‑latitude East Asia, and offers a valuable reference for refining isotope‑enabled climate models over East Asia."

Using anonymous GPS signals from vehicles, we tracked traffic patterns throughout the year 2023. The results show that emissions vary significantly between cities and across different days and seasons. This method could help cities monitor on-road emissions in real time and design better strategies to reduce them. 
 On-road transportation is a major contributor to CO2 emissions in cities, and high-resolution CO2 traffic emission maps are essential for analyzing emission patterns and characteristics. In this study, we developed new hourly CO2 emission maps at 100 × 100 m resolution for 20 major cities in France, Germany, and the Netherlands in 2023.  We used commercial Floating Car Data (FCD) based on anonymized GPS signals periodically reported by individual vehicles, providing hourly information on mean speed and on the number of GPS sample counts per street. Machine learning models were developed to fill FCD data gaps and convert sample counts into actual traffic volumes, and the COPERT model was used to estimate speed- and vehicle type dependent emission factors. Hourly emissions, initially estimated at the street level, were aggregated to 100 × 100 m grid cells. Annual on-road CO2 emissions across the 20 European cities in 2023 ranged from 0.4 to 7.6 Mt CO2, with emissions strongly correlated with urban area (R² = 0.97) and, to a lesser extent, population size (R² = 0.72). Spatially, emissions are either highly concentrated along major highways in cities such as Paris and Amsterdam or more evenly distributed in cities such as Berlin and Bordeaux, highlighting the need for context-specific mitigation strategies. Temporally, this study shows the CO2 emission fluctuations due to holiday periods, weekly activity cycles, and distinct usage profiles of different vehicle types. Due to the low latency of FCD, this approach could support near-real-time traffic emission mapping in the future. Our approach enhances the spatial and temporal characterization of CO2 emissions in on-road transportation compared to the conventional method used in gridded inventories, indicating the potential of FCD data for near-real-time urban emission monitoring and timely policy making.

With high spatial accuracy and wide coverage, it enables evaluation of automated detection methods, improves model boundary conditions, and supports long-term studies of glacier change and sea-level rise. 
 Calving front positions of marine-terminating glaciers are a key indicator of variations in glacier dynamics, ice–ocean interactions, and serve as critical boundary conditions for ice sheet models. High-precision, long-term records of calving front variability are essential for understanding glacier recession and calving processes, improving mass loss estimates, and supporting the development and validation of robust automated front-tracking algorithms. However, existing datasets often exhibit limited spatial coverage, inconsistent temporal resolution, and heterogeneous delineation methods, which result in variable accuracy and insufficient detail, reducing the performance and transferability of automated calving front detection. Here, we present a spatially extensive, high-accuracy dataset of glacier calving front positions across Greenland, intended as a benchmark for algorithm training, model–data integration, and studies of seasonal glacier dynamics. The dataset comprises approximately 12,000 manually delineated calving front positions for ~290 outlet glaciers from 2002 through 2021, extracted from multi-source satellite imagery (Landsat, Sentinel-1/2, MODIS, ENVISAT, and ERS). Delineations were conducted using standardized workflows in the Google Earth Engine platform and ArcGIS, and each record is accompanied by comprehensive metadata, including acquisition date, digitization method, source imagery, and other relevant attributes. Positional accuracy was evaluated through comparison with high-resolution PlanetScope imagery and manually interpreted reference datasets, confirming high geometric fidelity with positional offsets ranging from about 40 to 100 m across representative glaciers, depending on image resolution and terminus complexity. In contrast, automated products tend to show reduced accuracy in verification areas with complex terminus morphology, reflecting their high sensitivity to image quality, limited generalizability across heterogeneous geometries, and the absence of large-scale, high-precision training data. This dataset contributes to mitigating these challenges by providing dense, manually validated, high-precision observations across Greenland, serving as a robust benchmark for developing and validating automated front detection algorithms, refining boundary representations in ice sheet models, and advancing understanding of ice–ocean interactions. The dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16879054 (Xi et al., 2025)."

Currently we have been able to understand this to a certain degree, but with data from the new Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite, we are now able to map the sea surface at a very small scale. We utilize this new data to better understand and map the shape of the global oceans. 
 We introduce a new Mean Sea Surface model (MSS) that incorporates the wide-swath altimetry obtained from the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite, along with long timeseries of conventional altimetry. The DTU25MSS constrains long wavelengths (> 20 km) from a suite of conventional altimeters while utilizing almost 2 years of SWOT observations to reduce the short wavelength noise and incorporate previously unmapped geodetic features into the MSS. Parametric long wavelength corrections of the SWOT data in order to compensate for the short time-scale is presented, and the resulting MSS model is compared with contemporary MSS models as well as data from the SWOT Cal/Val orbit. The MSS is available on http://doi.org/10.11583/DTU.29412275, and includes an experimental MSS which has the reference period moved to 2023 as opposed to 2003, to compensate for sea level rise. To extend the MSS into the coastal zone, the high-resolution 250 m SWOT data is used close to the coast (< 40 km), and resolves complex features previously not included. Using an updated MSS with better resolved short wavelength signals is seen to be a large benefit for interpreting the detailed SWOT observations with reduced leakage of geodetic features into the oceanographic signals, as well as ~30 % increase in spatial resolution. Due to incorporating complex novel features in the coastal zone that have been resolved by SWOT the full effect on other more coarse observations is a potential for further studies. The SWOT data and utilization of it is only expected to be improved with time and further development of methods for utilizing this new dataset will move it closer to its full potentials."

We found that the model did well simulating past ocean conditions like temperature and nutrient and oxygen levels and can even reproduce metrics used by, and important to, ecosystem managers. 
 Regional ocean models enable the generation of computationally affordable and regionally tailored ensembles of near-term forecasts and long-term projections of sufficient resolution to serve marine resource management. Climate change, however, has created marine resource challenges, such as shifting stock distributions, that cut across domestic and international management boundaries and have pushed regional modeling efforts toward “coastwide” approaches. Here, we present and evaluate a multidecadal hindcast with a Northeast Pacific regional implementation of the Modular Ocean Model, version 6, with sea ice and biogeochemistry that extends from the Chukchi Sea to the Baja California Peninsula at 10 km horizontal resolution (MOM6-COBALT-NEP10k, or NEP10k). This domain includes an Arctic-adjacent system with a broad, shallow shelf seasonally covered by sea ice (the eastern Bering Sea), a sub-Arctic system with upwelling in the Alaska Gyre and predominant downwelling winds and large freshwater forcing along the coast (the Gulf of Alaska), and a temperate, eastern boundary upwelling ecosystem (the California Current Ecosystem). The coastwide model was able to recreate seasonal and cross-ecosystem contrasts in numerous ecosystem-critical properties including temperature, salinity, inorganic nutrients, oxygen, carbonate saturation states, and chlorophyll. Spatial consistency between modeled quantities and observations generally extended to plankton ecosystems, though small to moderate biases were also apparent. Fidelity with observed zooplankton biomass, for example, was limited to first-order seasonal and cross-system contrasts. Temporally, simulated monthly surface and bottom temperature anomalies in coastal regions (<500 m deep) closely matched estimates from data-assimilative ocean reanalyses. Performance, however, was reduced in some nearshore regions coarsely resolved by the model's 10 km resolution grid and for point measurements. The time series of satellite-based chlorophyll anomaly estimates proved more difficult to match than temperature. System-specific ecosystem indicators were also assessed. In the eastern Bering Sea, NEP10k robustly matched observed variations, including recent large declines, in the area of the summer bottom water “cold pool” (<2 °C), which exerts a profound influence on eastern Bering Sea fisheries. In the Gulf of Alaska, the simulation captured patterns of sea surface height variability and variations in thermal, oxygen, and acidification risk associated with local modes of interannual to decadal climate variability. In the California Current Ecosystem, the simulation robustly captured variations in upwelling indices and coastal water masses, though discrepancies in the latter were evident in the Southern California Bight. Enhanced model resolution may reduce such discrepancies, but any benefits must be carefully weighed against computational costs given the intended use of this system for ensemble predictions and projections. Meanwhile, the demonstrated NEP10k skill level herein, particularly in recreating cross-ecosystem contrasts and the time variation of ecosystem indicators over multiple decades, suggests considerable immediate utility for coastwide retrospective and predictive applications."

In particular, green roofs can provide numerous environmental benefits, such as urban cooling, water retention, and carbon sequestration. The aim of this research is to develop a new module for calculating green roof CO2 fluxes within a model that can already simulate hydrological and thermal processes of such roofs. The calibration and evaluation of this module take advantage of long-term experimental data. 
 Green roofs are promoted to provide ecosystem services and to mitigate climate change in urban areas. This is largely due to their supposed benefits for biodiversity, rainwater management, evaporative cooling, and carbon sequestration.  One scientific challenge is quantifying the various contributions of green roofs using reliable methods. In this context, the green roof module already running in the Town Energy Balance urban canopy model for water and energy exchanges was improved by implementing CO2 fluxes and  carbon sequestration potential. This parameterization combines the Interactions between Soil–Biosphere–Atmosphere (ISBA) photosynthesis, biomass, and soil respiration module with the green roof module in order to quantify the net CO2 amount emitted or fixed by the green roof over a time period. Measurement data from an extensive non-irrigated Sedum green roof located at  Berlin Brandenburg (BER)  Airport in Germany from 2016 to 2020 are used to calibrate and evaluate the parameterization. Based on the 5 years of measurements, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to quantify the significance of selected parameterization parameters for the photosynthesis process, followed by a calibration over the most important parameters and an evaluation. Results show good agreement of the simulated leaf area index and CO2 fluxes with in situ observations, with good diurnal, seasonal, and inter-annual variability, although the model tends to be overly responsive on the day-to-day variability. The model effectively reproduces  net ecosystem exchange, which provides a reliable estimation of the annual carbon  sequestration. These results are encouraging in terms of quantifying the potential of carbon sequestration by green roofs and open up the possibility of applying the new parameterization on a city-wide scale to evaluate green roof scenarios."

This research contributes to a better understanding of hail formation. 
 Hail forecasting using numerical models remains a challenge due to the uncertainties and deficiencies in microphysics schemes. In this study, we assessed the hail simulation performance of the two-moment Milbrandt–Yau (MY2) microphysics scheme within the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model by simulating three heavy rainfall events in Meiyu systems in which hail was rarely observed, rather than focusing on hail cases as done in previous research. Simulation results showed that the MY2 scheme produced noticeable hail in these rainstorms. Further analysis revealed that the overprediction of hail was caused by the imperfect graupel-to-hail conversion parameterization method adopted in the MY2 scheme. By incorporating the graupel spongy wet growth process, the modified scheme significantly mitigated the hail overforecasting. Moreover, the modified MY2 scheme kept the ability to simulate hail in real hail cases, demonstrating its ability to differentiate between heavy rainfall and hail events – a distinction the original scheme lacked. By comparing simulations of both rainstorms and hailstorms, it is concluded that the upward transport of large raindrops near the 0 °C level is critical for the graupel-to-hail conversion."

Traditional models require complex methods that lack flexibility. We developed PINNICLE (Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Ice and CLimatE), an open-source Python library that integrates machine learning with physical laws to improve ice sheet modeling. By combining data and physics, PINNICLE enhances predictions and adaptability, providing a powerful tool for climate research and sea level rise projections. 
 Predicting the future contributions of the ice sheets to sea-level rise remains a significant challenge due to our limited understanding of key physical processes (e.g., basal friction, ice rheology) and the lack of observations of critical model inputs (e.g., bed topography). Traditional numerical models typically rely on data assimilation methods to estimate these variables by solving inverse problems based on conservation laws of mass, momentum, and energy. However, these methods are not versatile and require extensive code development to incorporate new physics. Moreover, their dependence on data alignment within computational grids hampers their adaptability, especially in the context of sparse data availability in space and time. To address these limitations, we developed PINNICLE (Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Ice and CLimatE), an open-source Python library dedicated to ice sheet modeling. PINNICLE seamlessly integrates observational data and physical laws, facilitating the solution of both forward and inverse problems within a single framework. PINNICLE currently supports a variety of conservation laws, including the Shelfy-Stream Approximation (SSA), MOno-Layer Higher-Order (MOLHO) models, and mass conservation equations, for both time-independent and time-dependent simulations. The library is user-friendly, requiring only the setting of a few hyperparameters for standard modeling tasks, while advanced users can define custom models within the framework. Additionally, PINNICLE is based on the DeepXDE library, which supports widely used machine learning packages such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX, enabling users to select the backend that best fits their hardware. We describe here the implementation of PINNICLE and showcase this library with examples across the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets for a range of forward and inverse problems."

Evaluation data include forest inventories, carbon and water fluxes between the forest and the atmosphere, and leaf area and canopy height from remote sensing products. The model realistically predicts the structure and composition as well as the seasonality of carbon and water fluxes at both sites. 
 TROLL 4.0 is an individual-based forest dynamics model that jointly simulates the structure, diversity, and functioning of tropical forests, including their water balance, carbon fluxes, and leaf phenology, while accounting for intraspecific trait variation for a large number of species. In a companion paper, we describe how the model represents the physiological and demographic processes that control the tree life cycle in a 1 m resolution spatially explicit scene and uses plant functional traits measurable in the field to parameterize such processes across species and individuals (Maréchaux et al., 2025). Here we evaluate the performance of TROLL 4.0 for two Amazonian sites with contrasting soil and climate properties. We assessed the model's ability to represent forest structure, composition, and dynamics using lidar-derived spatial distribution of top canopy height and forest inventories combined with information on plant functional traits. We also evaluated the model's ability to represent carbon and water fluxes, as well as leaf area variation, at daily and fortnightly resolution over a decade, using detailed information from on-site eddy covariance towers, satellite data, and ground-based or airborne lidar data. We finally compared the responses of carbon and water fluxes to environmental drivers between simulated and observed data. Overall, TROLL 4.0 provided a realistic representation of forests at both sites. The simulated canopy height distribution showed a high correlation coefficient (CC) with observed aerial and satellite data (CC > 0.92), while the species and functional composition were well represented (CC > 0.75). TROLL 4.0 also realistically simulated the seasonal variability of carbon and water fluxes (CC > 0.46) and their responses to environmental drivers, while capturing temporal variations in leaf area (CC > 0.76) and its partitioning into leaf age cohorts. However, TROLL 4.0 overestimated annual gross primary productivity at both sites (mean RMSEP = 0.94 ± 0.67 kgC m−2 yr−1) and evapotranspiration at one site (mean RMSEP = 0.75 ± 0.63 mm d−1), likely due to an underestimation of the soil water depletion and stomatal control during the dry season. This evaluation highlights the potential of TROLL 4.0 to represent ecosystem fluxes and the structure, diversity, and dynamics of plant communities at a fine resolution, paving the way for model predictions of the effects of climate change, fragmentation, and forest management on forest structure and dynamics."

Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants are widespread, including in oceans, yet their multigenerational impacts remain poorly understood. We investigated whether BDE-99, a ubiquitous PBDE, induces neurobehavioral and molecular effects across generations in the fish Fundulus heteroclitus. To assess influences of exposure route, we conducted two experiments: in the progenitor exposure, adults were dosed via diet, leading to maternal transfer into F1 eggs; in the direct embryonic exposure, embryos were exposed via water, achieving comparable doses. Both exposures altered larval photomotor responses in F1, but other outcomes differed between exposure route. In the progenitor exposure, maternally exposed F1 juveniles exhibited reduced anxiety-like behavior and altered brain gene expression. In the direct embryonic exposure, F0 fish showed no detectable effects but produced F1 descendants with behavioral changes. This suggests that F1 effects in the progenitor exposure were not driven by chemical transfer alone, but by additional maternal influences. While effects in the progenitor exposure diminished in F2, early behavioral changes were still observed. We conclude that maternal influences shape multigenerational effects of BDE-99 exposure, with exposure route affecting both the nature and persistence of neurobehavioral and molecular outcomes."

In this study, we coupled an ensemble of global climate models with a province-hour-level power system optimization model to explore feasible deep decarbonization pathways for China’s power system. The results indicate that climate change impacts the power balance by increasing cooling demand, decreasing heating demand, and shifting wind and solar power generation. Under these effects, achieving China’s carbon neutrality target by 2060 will require more than 93.2% of power generation from nonfossil sources and the addition of 4047.6–4053.9 GW in new transmission capacity. This means a 40.4–42.5% increase in transmission line costs ($37.9–39.6 billion) compared to the baseline scenario. Furthermore, under deep decarbonization pathways, abundant solar resources in provinces with insufficient local power supply help mitigate supply–demand imbalances under SSP1-2.6, resulting in a cost reduction of 0.7–1.4% ($1.0–1.7 billion) compared to SSP5-8.5. In conclusion, our findings underscore the potential of interregional dispatch in mitigating renewable energy intermittency, which is crucial for designing decarbonization pathways for power systems that account for climate change adaptation."

Pye,Implications of Printing Ink Composition for Ambient Air Pollutants,"Emissions from volatile chemical products (VCPs) have become increasingly important to anthropogenic organic carbon emissions and consequently to anthropogenic ozone and secondary organic aerosol (SOA), as emission control strategies have reduced contributions from combustion sources. Industrial and consumer printing inks contribute considerably to VCP emissions, yet emission speciation profiles for printing inks are outdated and ignore the increasing market share of water-based inks. This study develops organic compound emissions profiles for one organic-solvent-based industrial ink and two water-based consumer inks using microchamber emissions tests. The composition of the solvent-based ink differed from the declared composition. Emission profiles were applied to estimates of SOA and O3 formation potential and inhalation risk. The chemical species that drive the estimated O3 formation potential correspond closely to species that drive the total emissions mass. However, this study shows that species responsible for SOA and chronic inhalation risk are present in low quantities in inks, and those end points may be under-emphasized in mass-weight emission profiles. The SOA and O3 formation from printing inks is estimated to have decreased about 42% since 2001, principally due to decreasing total ink usage but aided by increased use of water-based inks, which have a low potential to form SOA and O3."

Here we introduce Deep Learning Earth System Model (DLESyM), a parsimonious deep learning model that accurately simulates the Earth's current climate over 1000‐year periods with minimal smoothing and no drift. DLESyM simulations equal or exceed key metrics of seasonal and interannual variability—such as tropical cyclogenesis over the range of observed intensities, the cycle of the Indian Summer monsoon, and the climatology of mid‐latitude blocking events—when compared to historical simulations from four leading models from the sixth Climate Model Intercomparison Project.

Lake drainage occurs through two distinct mechanisms, namely lateral drainage and internal drainage. Here, we identified 3,969 lake drainage events from 2001 to 2020 across the northern permafrost region using high‐resolution, multi‐temporal satellite imagery. For each drainage event, we determined its specific timing and mechanism, enabling the first circumpolar classification of lake drainage types at monthly resolution. Lateral drainage accounted for 90.6% of all cases and peaked in June, aligning with increased snowmelt and precipitation in continuous permafrost regions. In contrast, internal drainage events were concentrated in March, when soils begin to thaw in sporadic and isolated permafrost zones with limited surface water input. These findings highlight distinct seasonal and climatic drivers of lake drainage and underscore the need to differentiate between surface and subsurface pathways when assessing permafrost landscape responses."

The presence of 0°C ${}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ melting surface cools Tair and generates a unique boundary layer on glacierized regions, known as the cooling effect (CE). Ignoring the CE leads to inaccurate predictions of glacier melting and glacier response to future climate change. Based on in situ observations and large eddy simulation using the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF‐LES), we investigated the meteorological conditions of Yanong Glacier (165.4 km2 ${\text{km}}^{2}$), Parlung No. 4 Glacier (10.5 km2 ${\text{km}}^{2}$) and Parlung No. 94 Glacier (2.5 km2 ${\text{km}}^{2}$), aiming a better understanding of the CE pattern on the three glaciers of different sizes. Our study shows that Yanong Glacier has a favorable topography for the formation of strong and stable katabatic winds and exhibits a significant CE of −2.9°C ${-}2.9{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ during the 2023 ablation season. The medium‐sized P4 Glacier and the small P94 Glacier, by contrast, show a weaker CE of −1.6°C ${-}1.6{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and −0.8°C ${-}0.8{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, respectively. The WRF‐LES model with 240 m resolution effectively simulates boundary layer processes for larger glaciers. The model results highlight a strong correlation between Tair and katabatic wind speed, with significant CE observed below 4,700 m elevation for Yanong Glacier. The glacier CE does not increase uniformly along the flow line, especially for larger glaciers. Our finding suggested that future methods for estimating on‐glacier Tair should consider various factors such as glacier slope, area, geometry, flow line distance, and wind fields."

In this study, we investigated future changes in TC precipitation and its scaling with temperature in 10 TC events that impacted the United States and Caribbean Islands. We performed four‐member ensembles of convection‐permitting regional model simulations for each TC under historical conditions and under a high‐emissions scenario for the mid‐21st century. We found that future TC precipitation in a reference frame following the TC increased up to ∼1.5 times the historical for all 10 TCs and scaled at super‐CC rates of 9%–17% K−1 for nine of the 10 TCs. Precipitable water scaling was less than precipitation scaling for nine of 10 TCs, indicating that it alone did not fully explain the future TC precipitation changes. Midtropospheric ascent increased in the future by 8%–30% for nine of the 10 TCs and supported the super‐CC precipitation increases. For TC size, we found that the radius of maximum wind during peak TC intensity decreased for nine of 10 TCs by up to 40%; however, the correlation with precipitation scaling was weak and insignificant. In addition, we found that thermodynamically driven TC translation speed exhibited no systematic future change and poorly explained regional storm‐total precipitation changes. This study indicates that TCs can enhance future flooding risk regardless of changes in TC size or translation speed, with precipitation increases that exceed simple theoretical thermodynamic estimates."

 Tropical volcanic eruptions with a high volcanic explosivity index (≥5) impact the global climate system, but little is known about how they affect floods. Here, leveraging global climate model simulations with volcanic forcings and statistical relationships between seasonal climate drivers and peak discharge, we investigate the response of seasonal peak discharges at 7,886 streamgauges worldwide to three tropical explosive volcanic eruptions in the twentieth century: Agung 1963 (Indonesia), Santa Maria 1902 (Guatemala) and Pinatubo 1991 (Philippines), whose stratospheric aerosol plumes were distributed primarily in the Southern Hemisphere, primarily in the Northern Hemisphere and symmetrically across both hemispheres, respectively. For the eruptions with interhemispherically asymmetric aerosol distributions, tropical regions show more immediate and widespread responses to the eruptions than non-tropical regions, with a distinct interhemispheric contrast of decreasing (increasing) peak discharges in the hemisphere in which the eruption happened (did not happen). For the case of symmetric aerosol distribution, tropical (arid) regions have the strongest tendency to respond to the eruption by decreasing (increasing) peak discharges in both hemispheres. These regional flood responses are attributed mainly to seasonal precipitation changes across the climate regions.

Here, the authors show how a cis-natural antisense RNA promotes proximal polyadenylation of its cognate SlSPX5 gene in response to phosphate starvation in tomato. 
 Alternative polyadenylation (APA) generates transcript diversity by producing mRNA isoforms with distinct 3’ ends. Despite the critical roles that APA plays in various biological processes, the mechanisms regulating APA in response to stresses have remained poorly understood in plants. Here, we perform comprehensive analysis of APA in tomato, and focus on a phosphate (Pi)- regulated APA gene SlSPX5, encoding a putative Pi sensor protein. SlSPX5 interacts with and sequesters the transcription factor SlPHL1 in the cytosol, thereby inhibiting the expression of Pi starvation inducible genes. We discover that a cis-natural antisense RNA (cis-NAT) is activated from SlSPX5 to promote its proximal polyadenylation under Pi-depleted conditions. The transcription of this cis-NAT induces RNA Polymerase II pausing, generating Ser2 phosphorylation signals that recruit polyadenylation machinery to the 5’ end of SlSPX5. Our findings demonstrate that a cis-NAT regulates APA of its cognate gene in response to Pi starvation. Alternative polyadenylation is involved in plant responses to various stresses.

 Despite the development of various pseudocapacitive materials, full-cell pseudocapacitors have yet to surpass the power density of conventional electric double layer capacitors, primarily due to the lack of high-rate positive pseudocapacitive materials. This work reports a solid-state conjugated polyelectrolyte that achieves high-rate charge storage as a positive electrode, facilitated by a co-ion desorption mechanism. The conjugated polyelectrolyte retains 70% of its capacitance at 100 A g−1 with a mass loading of 2.8 mg cm−2 and exhibits a long cycling life of 100,000 cycles in a Swagelok cell configuration. Increasing the electrode thickness fourfold has minimal impact on ion diffusivity and accessibility, yielding a high areal capacitance of 915 mF cm−2.

Here, authors develop a Dyson sphere-like evaporator capable of self-generating internal convection to significantly improve evaporation rates. Energy allocation for direct water evaporation and vapor removal is investigated. 
 Enhancing solar evaporation performance while minimizing material consumption is essential for advancing the practical application of interfacial solar evaporation technologies. Although introducing external airflow can significantly boost evaporation rates, it requires additional components and electricity input, compromising the simplicity, passivity and sustainability of interfacial solar evaporation. To address this challenge, Dyson sphere-like evaporators (DSEs) capable of self-generating convective flow inside the evaporator are designed. This self-generated internal airflow facilitates the removal of generated vapor from both inner and outer evaporation surfaces, thus significantly improving the evaporation rate. Notably, despite sacrificing 36% of solar light energy to generate internal convection, the DSE still achieves a much higher evaporation rate (4.08 kg m−2 h−1) compared to a typical spherical evaporator (2.04 kg m−2 h−1) which utilizes all the solar light energy directly for water evaporation. This finding suggests that future evaporator design should consider the balance between the energy used for water evaporation and convection generation for vapor removal.

 A recent study suggested that morphologically diploblastic sea anemones (Cnidaria) have three segregated germ layer identities corresponding to the bilaterian germ layers. Here, we investigated how these germ layer identities are specified during early development of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. Our gene expression analysis shows that the mesodermal territory is specified at the animal pole at 6 h postfertilization, followed by the specification of the definitive endoderm between mesoderm and ectoderm. We then assessed the role of β-catenin, MAPK, and Notch signaling during mesoderm and endoderm formation. We show that the mesodermal marker genes are activated by MAPK signaling while being repressed elsewhere by β-catenin signaling. Delta-expressing mesoderm then signals to Notch-expressing ectoderm, inducing the definitive endoderm domain at the mesoderm/ectoderm interface. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments showed that Notch signaling is sufficient for endoderm induction. Based on our results, we propose a model of germ layer specification in Nematostella defined by a crosstalk of MAPK, β-catenin, and Notch signaling. Given the similarity of the germ layer specification between the sea anemone and echinoderms, we propose that triploblasty may have predated the split of cnidarians and bilaterians.

 Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) is associated with anti-tumoral immune response and with the efficiency of cancer immunotherapy, yet overcoming ITH remains a significant challenge. Notably, cellular MYC (c-MYC) has been shown to be a pivotal orchestrator of this ITH progression. Here, we develop a c-MYC-based sensing circuit (cMSC) that is activated exclusively by aberrant c-MYC levels, along with an exosome-based cell-to-cell (CtC) system that augments communication among tumor cells, effectively targeting all cells in tumors circumventing the limitations imposed by ITH. Further expression of multifunctional immunostimulatory agents in these cMSC-reprogrammed cancer cells remodels the tumor microenvironment, enhancing selective T-cell-mediated oncolysis. Our cMSC/CtC platform specifically senses aberrant c-MYC expression and subsequently triggers a robust cancer immunotherapeutic response.

 Nitrogen (N) fertilizer plays a crucial role in agriculture. The conventional production and use of solid nitrogenous fertilizers results in substantial energy consumption and severe groundwater pollution. Here we propose an absorption‒electroreduction relay strategy capable of the distributed production of directly accessible liquid N fertilizer (NH4NO3 solution) from NOx, a common constituent of exhaust gases. When combined with plasma-driven N fixation, the raw feedstock in this strategy can be further extended to air. NOx is first absorbed by an aqueous solution. The NOx− produced as well as the residual NOx are selectively reduced to NH4NO3 by a ruthenium‒cobalt electrocatalyst (Ru9Co91). Through the N balance established between the absorption and electroreduction processes, NH4NO3 solutions are produced continuously without any other additive ions. We successfully constructed an 8-l membrane-free system that outputs 8.5 l h−1 of NH4NO3 solution at a constant concentration (840 mg l−1 of N) to meet the N fertilizer requirements for 20 m2 of farmland.

 Submarine springs that drain inland karst aquifers may be subject to abrupt flow reversals in which alternatively freshwater outflows to the sea or saltwater inflows into the aquifer. Here we provide a full flow reversal long-duration data time series at the Vise spring (below Thau lagoon, south of France) during which saltwater inflows into the aquifer. We demonstrate that the driving parameter of the hydrosystem regime shifts is the hydraulic gradient between the aquifer and the lagoon, controlled by water density changes. We reveal the existence of two tipping points: (i) below a hydraulic gradient threshold, the hydrosystem suddenly degrades from a normal regime to saltwater intrusion, and (ii) a much larger hydraulic gradient is necessary for the recovery of the hydrosystem.

 Several US programs provide smaller-scale forest landowners access to carbon markets where they can earn payments in exchange for stricter timber management. We study participation in one program—the Family Forest Carbon Program—and find that 1% of likely eligible owners in five high-enrollment counties in Pennsylvania enrolled in the first 3 years, less than what landowner surveys predict. Comparisons of enrolled parcels with those of the likely eligible population reveal a similar average extent of harvesting over the 35 years prior to enrollment. Under the current owner, however, enrolled parcels had 50% more harvesting than comparable parcels. We find that more harvesting in the past 20 years reduces harvesting in the present, suggesting that, absent the Program, enrolled parcels might have less future harvests. The findings indicate that expanding carbon market access is one challenge, enrolling landowners, especially those with high offset potential, is another.

 Monoterpenes are key to plant communication and defence against biotic (e.g., herbivory) and abiotic (e.g., heat, drought) stress. Chiral monoterpenes, like alpha-pinene, exist as mirror image pairs, known as enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same atmospheric reactivity, but are produced and emitted by different enzymes and internal leaf mechanisms. Abiotic stress can alter their relative emissions, suggesting enantiomer ratios could indicate stress severity. Here we present (−)- and (+)-alpha-pinene and methyl salicylate measurements from the Amazon rainforest over time-of-day, season, and the 2023-24 El Niño. Correlations between alpha-pinene enantiomers shifted with stress, aligning with weakening carbon dioxide uptake by vegetation and transition between de novo and storage emissions. Low- and high-stress zones, along with a recovery zone, were defined through alpha-pinene enantiomer correlations, revealing a metric for ecosystem stress. This chiral ratio reveals diel, seasonal, El Niño, and edge effect stresses, offering a method to gauge drought severity due to climate change.

 Enhanced organic carbon burial associated with widespread black shale deposition functioned as a critical feedback mechanism for removing excess carbon from the atmosphere-ocean system during the Early Toarcian hyperthermal (~183 Ma). Although records from Chinese basins (Tarim, Ordos, Sichuan) suggest substantial terrestrial burial in lakes, spatial patterns and drivers remain unclear. To address this, we employ the fully coupled global climate model (Community Earth System Model, CESM 1.2.2) and the BIOME4 vegetation model to investigate the response of terrestrial organic carbon burial to Toarcian warming. Our simulations suggest that elevated atmospheric CO₂ during the Toarcian hyperthermal triggered a substantial poleward shift in global mid-latitude monsoon domains, resulting in spatial variations in moisture flux. Despite increased global productivity, moisture availability primarily controlled terrestrial carbon burial. Our results suggest that lakes with stable water supply were key carbon sinks during warming.

 Understanding how the El Niño–Southern Oscillation influences extreme streamflow events is essential for anticipating water-related risks in South America. Here, we analyse the relationship between this climate phenomenon and the likelihood of floods and droughts using a multi-decadal observational dataset of river discharge. We quantify how the probabilities of extreme events shift under different phases of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation. The results show that flood likelihood increases by over 120% during El Niño in the La Plata Basin and by over 120% during La Niña in the northern Amazon. Maximum precipitation and streamflow signals are generally aligned, but flood flows exhibit stronger amplification than high precipitation, suggesting a cumulative climate effect on extreme events. In contrast, increased drought probabilities of more than 120% is linked to El Niño in the Amazon, while La Niña raises drought risk in inland South America of more than 80%.

 The occurrence and fate of microplastics in forest ecosystems is a recognized knowledge gap. In this paper, we used an aligned extraction method to quantify microplastics (>20 µm) in organic and mineral forest soil horizons and throughfall deposition. Calculation of forest soil microplastic stocks and throughfall fluxes allowed an estimation of throughfall contribution to microplastic accumulation in forest soils back to 1950. We identified a short-term microplastic enrichment in decomposed litter horizons followed by an accumulation in lower mineral soil caused by litter turnover processes. Similar microplastic features in soil and throughfall deposition indicate that microplastics entering forest soils primarily originate from atmospheric deposition and litter fall, while other sources have a minor impact. We conclude that forests are good indicators for atmospheric microplastic pollution and that high microplastic concentrations in forest soils indicate a high diffuse input of microplastics into these ecosystems.

 As global urbanization accelerates and ecological challenges intensify, effective monitoring and assessing ecological conditions have become critical for sustainable development. Remote sensing technologies play an increasingly crucial role in this context. The Sustainable Development Goals Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1), a next-generation remote sensing satellite, provides 10-m spatial resolution and multispectral imaging capabilities, offering new opportunities for ecological monitoring. This study explores the ecological potential of SDGSAT-1 data, focusing on the comprehensive assessment of urban heat islands (UHI), urban vegetation coverage, and regional ecological conditions. This is achieved through a detailed comparison with the widely-used Landsat-8/9 data. The study develops several methodologies for cloud detection, atmospheric correction, and land dryness retrieval. Validation shows that the cloud removal effect achieved by the proposed SDGSAT Cloud Mask (SCM) algorithm is comparable to, or slightly better than, those of the CFMask algorithm for Landsat-9 and the machine learning-based S2cloudless algorithm for Sentinel-2A, with F1 scores greater than 0.92. The results show that the monitoring of regional ecological conditions by SDGSAT-1 is very similar to that of Landsat-8/9, with differences generally under 5 %. Because SDGSAT-1's multispectral and thermal infrared imagery has higher spatial resolution than Landsat-8/9, it can detect 5.6 % more vegetation area and 2.6 times larger high-temperature areas within urban environments than Landsat data. SDGSAT-1's finer resolution enables more detailed ecological assessments, supporting urban sustainability applications. However, due to the lack of shortwave infrared bands in the SDGSAT-1 imagery, it is less effective than Landsat-8/9 in interpreting land surface dryness and moisture content."

 Fluorescence light emitted by chlorophyll in plants is a direct probe of the photosynthetic process and can be used to continuously monitor vegetation status. Retrieving solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) using a machine learning (ML) approach promises to take full advantage of airborne and satellite-based instruments to map expected vegetation function over wide areas on a regular basis. This work takes a first step towards developing a ML-based SIF retrieval method. A general-purpose framework for the simulation of at-sensor radiances is introduced and applied to the case of SIF retrieval in the oxygen absorption band O2-A with the spaceborne DESIS and airborne HyPlant spectrometers. The sensor characteristics are modelled carefully based on calibration and in-flight data and can be extended to other instruments including the upcoming FLEX mission. A comprehensive dataset of simulated at-sensor radiance spectra is then assembled encompassing the most important atmosphere, geometry, surface and sensor properties. The simulated dataset is employed to train emulators capable of generating at-sensor radiances with sub-percent errors in tens of μs, opening the way for their routine use in SIF retrieval. The simulated spectra are shown to closely reproduce real data acquired by DESIS and HyPlant and can ultimately be used to develop a robust ML-based SIF retrieval scheme for these and other remote sensing spectrometers. Finally, the SIF retrieval performance of the 3FLD method is quantitatively assessed for different on- and off-band configurations in order to identify the best band combinations. This highlights how our simulation framework enables the optimization of SIF retrieval methods to achieve the best possible performance for a given instrument."

 Mapping surface water at high spatiotemporal resolution is critical for managing water resources and mitigating disasters. Current global surface water datasets are typically generated at a relatively coarse monthly temporal resolution and 30-meter spatial resolution. Moreover, the mixed pixel problem further limits their ability to precisely map small water bodies. This study produced the global Dynamic Surface Water Fraction (DSWF) mapping by combining Sentinel-2 imagery and Dynamic World dataset using Google Earth Engine (GEE). Different from the analysis-ready wall-to-wall global datasets, DSWF is generated on-demand online in response to user-defined areas of interest and time. DSWF explored sub-pixel surface water fraction information at 10-meter spatial resolution, enabling the precise representation of fine-scale spatial features of surface water and minimizing the blurring artifacts commonly associated with conventional hard classification. The accuracy of DSWF was evaluated across 113 validation tiles, demonstrating an overall root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.090 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.021 when validated against both pure and mixed pixels. In comparison to the 30-meter Landsat-based global datasets, DSWF provides more accurate spatial distributions of surface water, with particular effectiveness for small ponds and narrow rivers."

 Leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) is a crucial parameter reflecting vegetation’s photosynthetic activity. Many LCC inversion algorithms based on satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data have been developed in recent decades. The one-dimensional radiative transfer model, like PROSAIL (1D model), has been a classic tool for LCC inversion. In recent years, three-dimensional radiative transfer models (3D model) have been developed rapidly. However, studies on 3D models for LCC inversion are limited, and their impact on inversion accuracy across different sensor resolutions remains unclear. This study focuses on winter wheat and integrates the DART, Adel-Wheat, and PROSPECT models to construct the 3D-model-derived look-up table (LUT). The 3D-model-based LUT and 1D-model-based LUT were applied to Sentinel-2 (S2) and UAV data to retrieve LCC. Validation results demonstrate that the 3D-model-based algorithm significantly improves LCC inversion accuracy for both S2 and UAV images. For UAV data, the root mean square error (RMSE) decreases from 9.90 μg/cm2 to 7.97 μg/cm2, and the coefficient of determination (R2) improves from 0.70 to 0.79. For S2 data, the RMSE decreases from 12.40 μg/cm2 to 8.68 μg/cm2, while R2 increases from 0.66 to 0.85. Additionally, overestimation at low LAI levels and underestimation at high LCC levels are effectively reduced. The high accuracy achieved under varying LAI and LCC conditions allows the 3D model to capture temporal trends throughout the growing season better. The 3D-model-based LCC inversion algorithm can better utilize the high spatial resolution advantages, thereby playing a significant role in vegetation physiological monitoring and crop phenotyping."

 Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) exists across a broad particle size range plays a crucial role in regional air pollution and climate, yet its formation mechanisms under varying meteorological conditions remain poorly understood. In this study, size-segregated aerosol samples (0.056–18 μm) were collected in Jiaxing, a coastal city in eastern China. Samples were categorized into land breeze (LP), sea breeze (SP), and dust event periods (DP). Oxygenated organic aerosols (OOAs) were identified as the dominant component of organic matters across all periods (65.9–81.6 %). Radiocarbon (14C) analysis revealed that fossil-derived OOA exhibited a dominant contribution to total OOC (78.1 %). High correlations of OOA and O3 in both fine and coarse modes indicated the important role of gas-phase oxidation across all particle sizes, while a specific association between fine-mode SOA and Fe ions suggested an additional aqueous-phase contribution in the fine mode. During the LP, the relative short transport distance of land air masses resulted in lower oxidation states for both fine and coarse particles, leading to the lowest O/C values. In contrast, during the SP, increased aerosol liquid water enhanced SOA formation, elevating O/C in coarse particles. During the DP, extensive multi-generational oxidation occurred during long-range transport, yielding higher fine-mode O/C. The coarse-mode OOA was positively correlated with Cl− and Ca2+, implying heterogeneous formation related to soil dusts. This study highlights the complexity of SOA formation pathways through multiple air mass types and different particle sizes, underscoring the necessity to incorporate various formation pathways into atmospheric models for accurate simulations and policy guidance."

 In compliance with European air quality regulations and the Italian “Reti Speciali” agreement, a dedicated network of three strategically positioned monitoring stations was established in 2012. Designed to account for geographical variability, this network enabled the first coordinated sampling campaigns for atmospheric mercury (Hg) data in ambient air and deposition. The resulting representative nationwide data, collected from 2020 to 2023, enabled the detection of seasonal, temporal, and spatial variations, which are analyzed in this study. Throughout the observational period, atmospheric Hg levels varied among the stations, exhibiting annual mean values between 1.22 ± 0.25 and 2.01 ±0.42ng/m3. A notable decrease in concentrations was evident in the northern and central regions. Conversely, the southern station maintained relatively stable levels, likely attributable to the predominant influence of natural sources. Ambient air Hg concentrations were examined for the impact of potential sources, with analysis conducted at both synoptic and local scales. Long-range transport pathways were identified using Potential Source Contributing Function (PSCF) analysis, while local investigations incorporated meteorological parameters, ozone measurements, and nearby fire hot-spot data. Analysis of samples from Hg deposition monitoring campaigns (2021 - 2023) revealed total mercury deposition values below 20 ng/m2d.

 Air pollutant dynamics are influenced by various factors, leading to complex physical and chemical interactions in the atmosphere. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enable high-resolution measurements of spatiotemporal variability in air quality across different altitudes and locations. However, comprehensive studies that integrate vertical measurements with detailed analyses of meteorological conditions and impacts of transboundary pollution are lacking. We investigated the relationship between air pollution concentrations measured by UAVs during winter and various meteorological factors. We evaluated the relationship between irradiance and surface wind based on the measured concentrations of gaseous pollutants such as CO, NO2, O3, and SO2, as well as particulate pollutants such as PM2.5. The influence of long-range transport was assessed by clustering the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) backward air trajectories. Photochemical reactions were most active in the afternoon, resulting in decreased concentrations of CO and NO2, whereas O3 concentrations increased. While CO and NO2 concentrations were influenced by road traffic and the surrounding urban environment, those of O3 and PM2.5 were affected by long-range transport. High concentrations of CO, NO2, SO2, and PM2.5 were observed during periods of atmospheric stagnation.

10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108388,False,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文主要关注韩国极端气温的非平稳性分析，特别是热浪和热带夜的强度变化，以及这些变化与全球平均地表温度之间的关系。研究使用了广义极值（GEV）模型，并结合韩国60个气象站的观测数据，分析了1974年至2023年间的夏季和冬季极端气温。研究结果表明，极端气温的变化与全球气候变化有关，尤其是西海岸和南海岸的热带夜事件显著增加。虽然论文涉及大气过程（如北太平洋副热带高压和海洋变暖），但它主要侧重于气候变化的影响和适应策略，而不是大气环境遥感技术本身，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['Temperature extremes', 'Heatwaves', 'Tropical nights', 'Global warming', 'Climate adaptation', 'Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) model', 'Global Mean Surface Temperature (GMST)']",Jung-Hee Ryu;Jae-Heon Lee;Song-Lak Kang,Non-stationary temperature extremes in South Korea: An extreme value analysis of global warming impacts,"•Non-stationarity of South Korea’s heat extremes analyzed with GEV model using global mean surface temperature as covariate. •Heatwaves and especially tropical nights have intensified, with coastal areas experiencing markede changes. •Strengthened North Pacific High and warmer seas enhance humid air inflow, promoting tropical nights and heatwaves. 
 Understanding the evolution of temperature extremes under global warming is crucial for effective regional climate adaptation. In South Korea—a region undergoing rapid urbanization and facing rising heat-related risks—there is a growing need to better understand these changes, particularly in relation to global climate drivers. To meet this need, this study employs a non-stationary Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) model that incorporates global mean surface temperature (GMST) as a covariate. Daily maximum and minimum temperatures from 60 nationwide weather stations were analyzed, focusing on summer and winter extremes over durations ranging from 1 to 15 days during the period 1974–2023.The results reveal distinct regional and seasonal patterns of non-stationarity. Winter extremes have become milder, with broader temperature distributions and fewer cold events, indicating a weakening of cold spells. However, in terms of adverse societal and environmental impacts, summer extremes are more vulnerable. Tropical night events exhibit the greatest sensitivity to global warming, particularly along the west and south coasts, where their frequency and persistence have increased sharply. Heatwaves have also intensified, though less dramatically. These changes appear linked to large-scale climate dynamics, including intensification of the North Pacific Subtropical High and warming of surrounding seas, which enhance atmospheric moisture transport toward the Korean Peninsula. By integrating observational data with a dynamic statistical framework, this study provides new insights into the changing nature of temperature extremes and their drivers—offering a valuable basis for targeted adaptation strategies in South Korea."
