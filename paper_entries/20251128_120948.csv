10.1088/1748-9326/ae1b1f,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要关注绿色氢能在中国的电力和难以电气化行业脱碳方面的经济效益和成本竞争力。它探讨了如何利用绿色氢能来平衡可再生能源的季节性变化，并取代难以电气化行业中的化石燃料。研究重点在于能源系统的规划和运营，以及氢能基础设施的优化配置，以实现更经济高效的脱碳。虽然该研究涉及能源转型和减少碳排放，但它与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系。,"['Green Hydrogen', 'Decarbonization', 'Energy System Planning', 'Renewable Energy', 'Cost Optimization']",Haozhe Yang;Gang He;Eric Masanet;Ranjit Deshmukh,Economic benefits and cost competitiveness of green hydrogen in decarbonizing China’s electricity and hard-to-electrify sectors,"Green hydrogen has the potential to address two critical challenges in a zero-carbon energy system: balancing seasonal variability of solar and wind in the electricity sector, and replacing fossil fuels in hard-to-electrify sectors. In this study, focusing on China, we deploy a provincial-scale energy system planning and operation model to examine the technical and cost-optimal potential of green hydrogen to fully remove carbon-based fuels in the electricity and hard-to-electrify sectors by 2050. Our results show that green hydrogen infrastructure can enable more cost-effective decarbonization of both the electricity and hard-to-electrify sectors. First, in the zero-carbon electricity sector alone, utilizing green hydrogen as long-duration storage enables a 17% reduction in the electricity-only cost (ZE scenario) relative to one without hydrogen. However, cost savings hinge on the availability of underground hydrogen storage. Second, coupling the electricity and hard-to-electrify sectors by sharing green hydrogen infrastructure reduces the combined energy system cost by 6% compared to a decoupled energy system. Third, the coupled energy system also makes green hydrogen comparable to fossil fuel-based gray and blue hydrogen costs in China. Allocating the entire savings realized in the coupled energy system to just the hydrogen used as fuel/feedstock in hard-to-electrify sectors yields a 24% reduction in the hydrogen-only cost relative to the cost under the decoupled system. Last, coupling hydrogen infrastructure between electricity and hard-to-electrify sectors yields a substantially different spatial pattern of hydrogen production. In the decoupled energy system, 80% of hydrogen demand in electricity and hard-to-electrify sectors is produced locally within the same provinces, but the coupled energy system cuts local production to 30%, shifting production to high renewable energy generating provinces. Understanding the spatial patterns of optimal hydrogen infrastructure siting will help plan an integrated electricity and hydrogen system that can cost-effectively decarbonize multiple sectors and China’s broader economy."

Using 250 year simulations for Canada’s Taiga Plains, a priority of the 2 billion trees program, we tested afforestation and reforestation (A/R) strategies that combine species mix, planting density and surface albedo. Medium-density (600–1400 trees ha−1) mixed stands with ∼25%–40% deciduous trees stored 15%–30% more net ecosystem carbon than conifer monocultures by coupling rapid early growth with long-term retention and greater disturbance resilience. Replanting under-stocked stands with these mixtures raised long-term storage by 18%–30% over business-as-usual. Accounting for albedo showed pure evergreen or deciduous stands lost 6%–20% of their climate benefit, whereas mixed stands yielded net cooling and the highest sequestration (≈ 4.6–4.7 tCO₂e ha−1 yr−1). Partial harvesting plus replanting preserved, and sometimes increased, ecosystem carbon (≈ 300–340 tC ha−1) and productivity (≈ 1.6–2.0 tC ha−1 yr−1) without raising risk. Blending fast-growing deciduous trees with long-lived conifers at intermediate density maximizes boreal A/R climate value and informs reforestation policy elsewhere."

Subsurface conditions such as soil depth and groundwater availability can influence plant drought vulnerability. Yet, how subsurface factors interact with climate stress and shape forest vulnerability and die-off at landscape scales remains poorly understood. The record-breaking hot and dry 2023–2024 summer in southwestern Australia induced widespread stress in the Jarrah Forest ecosystem. Analysis of vegetation greenness anomalies using airborne geophysics data, groundwater depth records, climate data, and remote sensing revealed that vegetation die-off emerged from the interactions of heat, water stress, and subsurface conditions. Shallow soils, rocky substrates, and limited access to subsurface water predisposed vegetation to experience heat and drought stress. Identifying the role and location of subsurface features enables identification of vulnerable, and resilient, areas and will guide adaptive forest management for resilience against future climate extremes."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae1e16,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注全球气候敏感河流的径流量和时间变化，以及这些变化与降水之间的关系。虽然气候变化是大气环境的一个重要方面，但该研究的核心在于水文过程和河流生态系统，而非大气成分、空气质量或遥感技术。因此，它与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强。该研究强调了径流量和时间变化的长期趋势，以及这些变化可能导致的洪水、缺水和河流健康恶化等问题，并提出了相应的应对策略。,"['streamflow volume', 'streamflow timing', 'precipitation', 'climate-sensitive rivers', 'flooding', 'water shortages']",Rupesh Jayaram Patil;Yongping Wei;James Shulmeister,Over 100 global climate sensitive rivers are experiencing large and severe changes in streamflow volume and timing,"Only about one-third of global rivers (or tributaries) remain in a nearly natural condition, known as climate-sensitive rivers. We lack clear evidence on the changes in streamflow volume and timing of these rivers, which significantly compromises our capacity for protection. Here, we analyse alterations in streamflow and centre of timing at 1017 stream gauges across 812 climate-sensitive rivers and tributaries worldwide from 1950 to 2022. We observed increasing trends in streamflow volume (Q) at just over half of our sites (512), biased towards earlier changes in centre of timing (CT) (⩾−2 d yr−1), with more than 65% of records reflecting this trend. At over 80% of gauges, we found that rising Q and earlier CT are sensitive to increasing precipitation (P) and earlier centre of timing of precipitation (PCT). More than 60% of significant gauges show moderate to severe changes in Q and CT. We identified 104 global climate-sensitive rivers, located in subtropical, temperate and arctic regions, that have experienced large and severe changes based on long-term changes in Q seasonality (CT > ±15 d). Long-term changes in Q and CT may persist in rivers experiencing large and severe changes and intensify in those with minor and moderate changes. These changes will increase flooding, alter storage, cause water shortages, and degrade river health. We recommend proactive strategies including better streamflow monitoring, adaptive infrastructure (e.g. reservoirs, flood control), flexible flood management protocols, water-sharing agreements during droughts, and prioritised protection of ecosystems to buffer against variations in Q and CT."

We created a database of 8655 non-native insect records from 3059 non-native insect species of 312 families to better understand invasion vulnerability. Results showed that Coleoptera, Hemiptera, and Hymenoptera dominated, comprising 72.54% of all recorded non-native insects. Hotspots of non-native insects were primarily developed BRI corridor nations, such as New Zealand, Czechia, Austria and South Africa. These insects largely originated from Asia, Europe, and North America, with Oceania contributing the fewest. Model averaging and PLS path modeling showed that the merchandise imports and international tourism were positively correlated with non-native insect occurrences. 49.63% of the countries, including China, South Korea, Russia and Poland, were identified as medium- to high-vulnerable regions for non-native insect introduction.

Jimenez;Khanneh Wadinga Fomba,A nitrate photolysis source of tropospheric HONO is incompatible with current understanding of atmospheric chemistry,"HONO is key to tropospheric chemistry. Observations show high HONO concentrations in remote air, possibly explained by nitrate aerosol photolysis. We use observations to parameterize nitrate photolysis, evaluating simulated HONO against observations from multiple sources. We show improved agreement with observed HONO, but overestimates in NOx and O3, beyond observational constraints. This implies uncertainties in the NOx budget and our understanding of atmospheric chemistry. 
 Recent observations of nitrous acid (HONO) in the remote troposphere show much higher concentrations than can be explained through known sources, with important implications for air quality and climate. Laboratory evidence and modelling of field observations suggests that nitrate aerosol photolysis is the likely mechanism providing the additional HONO, offering a rapid route for recycling of NOx from nitric acid (HNO3). Previous studies of the global impact of this chemistry have used either very restricted HONO data or a “top-down” approach to parameterize the HONO source by reconciling simulated and observed NOx concentrations. Here, we use multiple, independent tropospheric HONO observations from different locations to parameterize nitrate photolysis, and evaluate its impacts on global atmospheric chemistry using GEOS-Chem. The simulations improve agreement between modelled and observed HONO concentrations relative to previous studies, decreasing the model bias by 5 %–20 %. The remaining (and large) underestimate of HONO in the model is due predominantly to an underestimate of total nitrate aerosol (−95 %) and is reduced to 20 % when accounting for low model nitrate. Despite the low bias in the model HONO, we find that nitrate aerosol photolysis leads to substantial global increases in NOx, O3 and OH concentrations, likely beyond the observational constraints. The additional source of NOx (∼ 48 Tg N yr−1 globally) is comparable to total NOx emissions from all sources (∼ 55 Tg yr−1). These HONO observations in the remote troposphere, thus imply a large uncertainty in the NOx budget and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric chemistry. Improved techniques to measure HONO at the low concentrations typical of remote areas, coupled with more measurements in these areas and improved process level understanding of nitrate photolysis are needed to provide quantitative assessment of its potentially global-scale atmospheric impacts."

Such variations further lead to 0.1 to 3.3 ppbv summertime ozone enhancement in agricultural hotspot regions and 6.7 ppbv to 16.6 ppbv reductions in global methane concentrations. 
 Natural and agricultural soils are important sources of nitrogen oxides (NOx), accounting for about 10 %–20 % of the global NOx emissions. The increased application of nitrogen (N) fertilizer in agriculture has strongly enhanced the N availability of soils in the last several decades, leading to higher soil NOx emissions. However, the magnitude of the N fertilizer-induced soil NOx emissions remains poorly constrained due to limited field observations, resulting in divergent estimates. Here we integrate the results from meta-analyses of field manipulation experiments, emission inventories, atmospheric chemistry modelling and terrestrial biosphere modelling to investigate these uncertainties and the associated impacts on ground-level ozone and methane. The estimated present-day global soil NOx emissions induced by N fertilizer application vary substantially (0.84–2.2 Tg N yr−1) among different approaches with different spatial patterns. Simulations with the 3-D global chemical transport model GEOS-Chem demonstrate that N fertilization enhances global surface ozone concentrations during summertime in agricultural hotspots, such as North America, western Europe and eastern and southern Asia by 0.1 to 3.3 ppbv (0.2 %–7.0 %). Our results show that such spreads in soil NOx emissions also affect atmospheric methane concentrations, reducing the global mean by 6.7 (0.4 %) ppbv to 16.6 (0.9 %) ppbv as an indirect consequence of enhanced N fertilizer application. These results highlight the urgent need to improve the predictive understanding of soil NOx emission responses to fertilizer N inputs and its representation in atmospheric chemistry modelling."

We improve the predictions of an Earth system model using deep learning, and evaluate the performance of difference types of statistical models. We find that simulations of future surface ozone are likely to become less accurate under a warmer climate. 
 Chemistry-climate models have developed significantly over the decades, yet they still exhibit substantial systematic biases in simulating atmospheric composition due to gaps in our understanding of underlying processes. Building on deep learning's success in different domains, we explore its application to correct surface ozone biases in the state-of-the-art chemistry-climate model UKESM1. Six statistical models have been developed, and the model Transformer outperforms others due to its advanced architecture. A simple weighted ensemble approach is further proved to enhance performance by 14 % over the best single model Transformer, reducing RMSE to 0.69 ppb. Applied to future scenarios (SSP3-7.0 and SSP3-7.0-lowNTCF), the UKESM1 shows a larger overestimation of ozone changes by up to 25 ppb compared to present-day conditions. Despite biases, UKESM1 captures the non-linear ozone sensitivity to precursors, with temperature-sensitive processes identified as a dominant contributor to biases. We highlight that simulations of future surface ozone are likely to become less accurate under a warmer climate. Therefore, the bias correction approaches introduced here have substantial potential to improve the accuracy of ozone impact assessments. These methods are also applicable to other chemistry-climate models, which is critical for informing air quality and climate policy decisions."

We found that meteorological variations, induced by a transition from El Niño to La Niña, were the main cause of persistent pollution, as stronger northerly winds enhanced pollutant transport into the region. In contrast, the effect of rapid emission reductions was limited. Recommendations for air quality improvement were also proposed. 
 Effective air quality management requires a comprehensive understanding of how meteorological variability and emission changes shape multiannual changes in regional PM2.5 pollution. During the cold seasons of 2015–2017, persistent PM2.5 pollution occurred in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), South China, despite rapid emission reductions. This study systematically investigated the interconnections between climate variability, meteorology, PM2.5 levels, source contributions and budgets during these periods, aiming to uncover the detailed impacts of meteorological and emission changes on PM2.5 pollution. We found that drastic meteorological changes, closely linked to a transition from strong El Niño (2015) to weak/moderate La Niña (2017), were the main drivers of the three-year PM2.5 changes. Strengthened northerly winds and reduced humidity enhanced cross-regional PM2.5 transport into the PRD while concurrently suppressing local PM2.5 production and accumulation. WRF/CMAQ simulations indicate that transport (non-local) contributions to PM2.5 in the PRD increased from 70 % in 2015 to 74 % in 2016 and 78 % in 2017. While the transport of secondary inorganic PM2.5 components overall intensified, their responses to meteorological and emission changes varied: Variations in sulfate were more sensitive to emission reductions outside the PRD, whereas those for nitrate were primarily driven by meteorological shifts. Simulated PM2.5 mass budgets further support the increasing dominance of transport, especially via advections. Our findings underscore the potentially crucial role of meteorological variability in driving multiannual PM2.5 pollution changes in the PRD and other regions strongly impacted by cross-regional transport, emphasizing the necessity for regionally coordinated emission control strategies to effectively mitigate PM2.5 pollution."

Quantifying detection limits of top-down methane monitoring infrastructures","Climate change is greatly affecting the Arctic. Among these changes is the thawing of permanently frozen soil, which may increase the release of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas (GHG). In this study we investigated the capabilities of tall GHG measuring towers and two satellite systems to detect this methane release. We find that these systems have different strengths and weaknesses, and that individually they struggle to detect these changes, though combined they might cover their weak spots. 
 Large quantities of carbon are stored in Yedoma permafrost. When temperatures rise, its high ice content is a catalyst for rapid degradation, which in turn may cause the release of large quantities of carbon. 40 % to 70 % of the radiative forcing from this release is expected to be in the form of CH4. In this observing system simulation experiment, we examined the capabilities of three atmospheric GHG monitoring platforms i.e. tall towers, and the TROPOMI and MERLIN satellite instruments, to detect changes in CH4 release from increased Yedoma thaw. A set of environments are simulated with the GEOS-5 model: one representing a “natural” emission case as the reference, a second featuring enhanced CH4 release from Yedoma soils. From within these modelled environments, synthetic measurements are generated following best in situ practices and realistic error characterizations.For the satellites we find the lowest detection limits when aggregating measurements over a 112 d period, at Yedoma fluxes of 144 % to 367 % of current conditions. These factors are up to 1.2 times higher when taking transport modelling uncertainties into account. The tall tower network shows a wide range of detection lower limits, the lowest at only 107 % of current fluxes, but has considerably higher lower detection limits when factoring in transport modelling errors. Overall, the individual systems appear to lack the ability to detect and attribute small changes in Yedoma CH4 fluxes, and would either need to be used in combination or require a considerable time to detect changes under higher emission scenarios."

 Large-sample hydrological datasets containing data for tens to thousands of catchments are invaluable for hydrological process understanding and modelling. CAMELS (Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies) datasets provide hydro-meteorological timeseries, catchment attributes and catchment boundaries. Here, we present the second version of CAMELS-GB. CAMELS-GB v2 collates millions of observations from across Great Britain at hourly to monthly timescales, including quality-controlled daily river flows, catchment boundaries, and catchment characteristics from the UK National River Flow Archive. The new features include (1) extended daily hydro-meteorological timeseries from 1970–2022 including meteorological timeseries from new observed climate datasets, (2) new hourly precipitation, river flow and level timeseries, (3) new groundwater level timeseries and attributes for 55 groundwater wells, and (4) new catchment attributes characterising changing land cover, peak flows and human influences. These data are provided for 671 catchments across Great Britain spanning a diverse range of geophysical characteristics and human influences. CAMELS-GB v2 represents a step change for environmental and modelling analyses across Great Britain, particularly for the characterisation of sub-daily hydrological processes, and is made available as an open dataset (Coxon et al., 2025; https://doi.org/10.5285/9a46d428-958f-4ac1-86eb-94eee70c0955)."

Using satellite images from the MODIS Terra and Aqua sensors, we monitored daily ice cover and seasonal freeze-up and breakup timing. On average, over 65 % of river segments show later freeze-up (~ 9 days), earlier breakup (~ 8 days), and shorter ice seasons (~ 14 days), revealing a clear signal of rapid warming across Arctic river systems. 
 River ice plays a critical role in Arctic freshwater routing, navigation safety, and biogeochemical exchange. However, consistent, daily-resolved observations across the pan-Arctic remain scarce. Here we present a harmonized, multi-decadal dataset of daily river ice concentration (RIC) and annual phenology (freeze-up, breakup, and ice duration) for the six largest Arctic rivers—Yukon, Mackenzie, Ob, Yenisey, Lena, and Kolyma—covering hydrological years 2001–2024. Built from >590,000 MODIS Terra/Aqua scenes, our workflow integrates a scalable threshold-based classifier on Google Earth Engine with dual-satellite daily synthesis, temporal-window cloud reclassification, and a high-latitude dark-period correction. Technical validation against higher-resolution optical imagery shows a mean RIC accuracy of 0.83 across basins. Phenological metrics derived from MODIS agree with in situ records with mean absolute errors (MAE) of 10.8 days for freeze-up and 11.4 days for breakup (improving to 8.4 days relative to the onset of ice drift), and with Landsat-based river-section phenology with MAE of 10.5 days (freeze-up) and 16.0 days (breakup). RIC correlates strongly with surface air temperature (mean Pearson r = −0.91) and increases systematically with latitude. Trend analysis from 2001 through 2024 shows delayed freeze-up in over 66 % of river segments, earlier breakup in more than 65 %, and shorter ice seasons in over 65 %. On average, freeze-up is delayed by 9.0 days, breakup occurs 7.8 days earlier, and ice duration shortens by 14.1 days over the study period. These basin-consistent, temporally resolved records provide an open benchmark for diagnosing cryospheric change in Arctic river corridors and for constraining model–data intercomparisons.

Collected over six monitoring periods between 2016 and 2025, it offers a critical basis for analysing thermal exposure of giant clams, identifying potential refugia, and supporting modelling of atoll responses to climate change. 
 In French Polynesia, semi-closed atolls of the eastern Tuamotu Archipelago are home to fisheries and mariculture activities based on giant clam resources. These activities are increasingly vulnerable to global warming, as evidenced by the mass bleaching event observed in Reao atoll in March 2024, triggered by the most intense and prolonged Marine Heatwave (MHW) ever recorded in this lagoon. The GAIA project (manaGement strAtegy evaluatIon for small-scale fisheries in Atoll lagoons) was launched to address this issue and aimed to explore the sustainability of giant clam fisheries under climate change, with a particular focus on processes driving thermal exposure during MHWs. To achieve this, spatial and temporal temperature fluctuations, lagoon circulation, and water exchange dynamics between ocean and lagoon across the atoll rim were monitored using moored autonomous oceanographic sensors. A total of 6 monitoring periods took place between December 2016 and May 2025, with the most extensive instrumentation covering the entire February–March 2024 MHW event. The strength of these observations lies not only in their coverage of a unique and poorly sampled ecosystem, but also in their comprehensive documentation of an exceptional MHW event, from its onset and peak to its dissipation, providing an unprecedented record of the full life cycle of a major thermal anomaly in a tropical semi-closed atoll lagoon. This dataset also supports future modelling efforts to simulate temperature dynamics and identify thermal refugia in atoll lagoons under changing climate scenarios. All data were post-processed, quality-controlled, and formatted into interoperable NetCDF files.

Using this methodology, we reveal systematic differences between high- and low-resolution DGVM simulations caused by under-representation of climate variability in the low-resolution data and poor representation of shore lines and inland water bodies. In a study area covering European Union, the differences in aggregated output variables were found to be 2.8%–7.3%. 
 Simulations of dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) are typically conducted at a spatial resolution of 0.5°, while higher-resolution simulations remain uncommon. This coarse resolution eliminates detailed orographic features and hence, associated climate variability, which are especially pronounced in mountainous regions. The impact of disregarding such variability on vegetation dynamics has not been thoroughly examined. In this study, we explore the differences in vegetation outcomes between the DGVM LPJ-GUESS simulations conducted at high and low spatial resolutions. Using the CHELSA algorithm, we create an elevation-informed high-resolution climate dataset for a domain encompassing the European Union. Distinctive features of this algorithm include orographic nature of formation of precipitation, a negative derivative of temperatures with respect to elevation, and also, detailed consideration of shadowing and exposure of the terrain to the Sun in computations of solar radiation. We design a custom experiment protocol and use it to perform LPJ-GUESS simulations on both resolutions. Comparative analysis reveals significant systematic discrepancies between the two resolutions. In mountainous areas, all of the considered output variables show statistically significant differences. In particular, carbon pools are smaller on the high resolution, with the total carbon pool being 37 %–39 % smaller. Furthermore, we quantify the extent to which the under-representation of orographic climate variation affects regional predictions across the European Union. This is expressed as a difference in the total value, which ranges from −3.8 % for the net ecosystem productivity to 2.9 % for the litter and soil C pools. These values are found to be comparable to differences caused by miss-representation of water bodies and shorelines on the low resolution."

Standard coupling algorithms introduce a numerical error, which one can compute with iterative coupling methods. We use such a method for a coupled model of a single vertical column of the atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice. We find that coupling errors in the atmosphere and at the ice surface can be substantial and that discontinuous physics parameterizations lead to convergence issues of the iteration. 
 The atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice components in Earth system models are coupled via boundary conditions at the sea surface. Standard coupling algorithms correspond to the first step of an iteration, so-called Schwarz waveform relaxation. Not iterating is computationally cheap but introduces a numerical coupling error, which we aim to quantify for the case of a coupled single column model: the EC-Earth AOSCM, which uses the same coupling setup and model physics as its host model, EC-Earth. To this end, we iterate until a reference solution is obtained and compare this with standard, non-iterative algorithms. Understanding the convergence behavior of the iteration, as well as the size of the coupling error, can inform model and algorithm development. Our implementation is based on the OASIS3-MCT coupler and allows to estimate the coupling error of multi-day simulations.In the absence of sea ice, SWR convergence is robust. Coupling errors for atmospheric variables can be substantial. When sea ice is present, results strongly depend on the model version. In the latest model version, coupling errors in sea ice surface and atmospheric boundary layer temperature are often large. Generally, we find that abrupt transitions between distinct physical regimes in certain parameterizations can lead to substantial coupling errors and even non-convergence of the iteration. We attribute discontinuities in the computation of atmospheric vertical turbulence and sea ice albedo as sources for these problems."

To support future satellite missions, we created a new land surface model based on the Crocus scheme that simulates snow microstructure. Key improvements include better snow albedo representation, enhanced Arctic snow modeling, and improved forest module to capture Canada's diverse snow conditions. Results demonstrate improved simulations of snow density and melt across large regions of Canada. 
 Snow microstructure – characterized by density, grain size, grain shape and arrangement – fundamentally determines snowpack macroscopic properties. Despite this critical role, many land surface models (LSMs) lack explicit representation of snow microstructure. This limitation has become increasingly critical as future spaceborne missions for snow water equivalent measurement demand advanced modelling systems capable of accurately estimating snowpack properties, including microstructure, across diverse climatic and vegetation regions. The Soil Vegetation and Snow (SVS) LSM, used by Environment and Climate Change Canada for operational land surface and hydrological predictions, has been substantially upgraded to address these challenges. SVS version 2.0 (SVS2) incorporates the detailed multilayer Crocus snowpack model, enabling distinct simulations of snowpack evolution in both open terrain and forested areas within each grid cell. Crocus within SVS2 has been upgraded from its original alpine design with three major enhancements to handle Canada's varied snowpack conditions: an advanced albedo parameterization that accounts for spatial variability in light-absorbing particle deposition, new physical parameterizations tailored to Arctic snow characteristics, and a refined canopy model for forest environments. Significant improvements in simulations of near-surface density predictions are evident along a latitudinal transect from southern Quebec to the Canadian Arctic, while challenges remain in simulation of density and specific surface area in basal snow layers. SVS2 achieved substantial gains in snow melt-out timing accuracy, reducing prediction errors by over 50 % compared to the alpine Crocus version and surpassing two established snow reference products (ERA5-Land and ERA5-Crocus). These enhancements position SVS2 as a substantial advancement for future operational snow modeling applications across Canada."

WUI fires emit a cocktail of chemicals from the combustion of anthropogenic materials, including compounds that may differ from the burning of biogenic‐only materials. There is currently limited knowledge on the mixture composition of combustible materials in WUI homes, representing a data gap and need to further characterize exposure chemistries and toxicological impacts of WUI‐relevant smoke exposures. To address this issue, this study integrated combustible materials in an average American WUI home to derive what we are referring to as the “Burning ExposHome.” Items such as structural materials, plumbing, furnishings, and appliances were included in the Burning ExposHome. Calculations were based on an average American household, a 2,016 sq. ft. single family home of four bedrooms, using materials typical to California due to the high incidence of WUI fires in that geographic region. All materials were sorted and summed by type of base material such as wood materials, plastics, textiles, and metals. This list is notably modular and detailed per item, allowing for the addition/subtraction of components to address future study designs. In summary, the total combustible mass of an average American home was around 46,500 kg, including 81% wood materials, 6% plastics, and 2% metals.

Although soil moisture (SM) and soil temperature (ST) are known to shape the fungal lifecycle, their effects on coccidioidomycosis remain understudied. Most prior studies have relied on their proxies—precipitation and air temperature—that might not accurately capture soil hydrothermal dynamics. We conducted multivariable negative binomial regressions to estimate seasonal associations between incidence and climate drivers—including SM, ST, and wind speed from the North American Land Data Assimilation Phase 2 (NLDAS‐2), and PM10‐based dusty‐day counts—in Arizona's hyperendemic counties (Maricopa, Pima, and Pinal) from 2000 to 2022. We found higher incidence in areas with hotter, drier soils and more seasonal dusty days. Multi‐year soil hydrothermal cycles—alternating wet–dry and cool–hot periods along with concurrent dry, dusty conditions—significantly influenced incidence. Notably, no antecedent dry–cool seasons were linked to increased incidence, indicating moisture and/or heat are prerequisites for fungal growth and dispersal. SM showed more consistent and widespread effects than ST across seasons and lags, with winter and spring soils most influential. Higher incidence followed wetter winters and monsoons, and dry, hot springs and falls. Our models using NLDAS‐2 SM and ST data showed robust performance and generalizability across exposure seasons. Our results support adding multi‐year soil indicators—with up to 3‐year lead times—into early‐warning systems to enhance VF forecasting and better prepare endemic regions for the challenges of a warming, drying, and increasingly variable climate."

To gain insights into this issue, we have constructed epidemic, drought, and flood indices for the Ming and Qing dynasties of China in a period of more than 400 years. Using adaptive fractal analysis, we find that the time series of epidemic, drought, and flood indices possess long‐range correlations of different degrees in different regions of China. More importantly, the scaling behavior for the cross correlations between the epidemic and the drought indices in Northern China is characterized by a non‐stationary emergent behavior rather than by a long‐range correlation, while this scaling behavior is close to the boundary of stationarity and non‐stationarity in the Central China.

 The molecular mechanisms that enable memories to persist over long timescales from days to weeks and months are still poorly understood1. Here, to develop insights into this process, we created a behavioural task in which mice formed multiple memories but only consolidated some, while forgetting others, over the span of weeks. We then monitored circuit-specific molecular programs that diverged between consolidated and forgotten memories. We identified multiple distinct waves of transcription, that is, cellular macrostates, in the thalamocortical circuit that defined memory persistence. Of note, a small set of transcriptional regulators orchestrated broad molecular programs that enabled entry into these macrostates. Targeted CRISPR-knockout studies revealed that although these transcriptional regulators had no effects on memory formation, they had prominent, causal and strikingly time-dependent roles in memory stabilization. In particular, the calmodulin-dependent transcription factor CAMTA1 was required for initial memory maintenance over days, whereas the transcription factor TCF4 and the histone methyltransferase ASH1L were required later to maintain memory over weeks. These results identify a critical CAMTA1–TCF4–ASH1L thalamocortical transcriptional cascade that is required for memory stabilization and put forth a model in which the sequential recruitment of circuit-specific transcriptional programs enables memory maintenance over progressively longer timescales.

 Lineage plasticity is a cancer hallmark that drives disease progression and treatment resistance1,2. Plasticity is often mediated by epigenetic mechanisms that may be reversible; however, there are few examples of such reversibility. In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), plasticity mediates resistance to androgen receptor (AR) inhibitors and progression from adenocarcinoma to aggressive subtypes, including neuroendocrine prostate cancer (CRPC-NE)3–5. Here we show that plasticity-associated treatment resistance in CRPC can be reversed through the inhibition of NSD2, a histone methyltransferase6. NSD2 upregulation in CRPC-NE correlates with poor survival outcomes, and NSD2-mediated H3K36 dimethylation regulates enhancers of genes associated with neuroendocrine differentiation. In prostate tumour organoids established from genetically engineered mice7 that recapitulate the transdifferentiation to neuroendocrine states, and in human CRPC-NE organoids, CRISPR-mediated targeting of NSD2 reverts CRPC-NE to adenocarcinoma phenotypes. Moreover, a canonical AR program is upregulated and responses to the AR inhibitor enzalutamide are restored. Pharmacological inhibition of NSD2 with a first-in-class small molecule reverses plasticity and synergizes with enzalutamide to suppress growth and promote cell death in human patient-derived organoids of multiple CRPC subtypes in culture and in xenografts. Co-targeting of NSD2 and AR may represent a new therapeutic strategy for lethal forms of CRPC that are currently recalcitrant to treatment. Inhibition of the histone methyltransferase NSD2 and the androgen receptor in preclinical models can reverse lineage plasticity to suppress tumour growth and promote cell death in multiple subtypes of castration-resistant prostate cancer."

 Plant metabolic activities are regulated to adapt to the fluctuating environment for optimized growth, while interplay between metabolic and chromatin pathways plays an essential role in environmental adaptation. However, how metabolic and chromatin regulators cooperate to control metabolite accumulation and gene expression required for stress tolerance remains unclear. Here, we show that the pyruvate kinase 1 (PK1) has a function to integrate stress signals for metabolic and epigenetic controls of heat tolerance in rice. Over-expression of PK1 enhances plant tolerance to heat, while its loss-of-function decreases the recovery rate from heat stress. Heat stress induces PK1 production, nuclear enrichment, lysine acetylation and activity for pyruvate accumulation, H3T11 phosphorylation (H3T11p) and H3K9 acetylation (H3K9ac), and gene expression. In addition, PK1 phosphorylates General control non-repressed protein 5 (GCN5) and stimulates its activity for H3K9ac. Conversely, under heat stress GCN5 enhances PK1 lysine acetylation and enhances its activity for H3T11p and pyruvate production. The PK1 and GCN5-controlled H3T11p and H3K9ac are required for heat stress-responsive gene expression. These results establish PK1 as key player linking metabolic and chromatin pathways and uncover a mutually stimulating mechanism between metabolic and chromatin regulators for stress tolerance in rice.

 Squeezed states of light are essential for emerging quantum technology in metrology and information processing. Chip-integrated photonics offers a route to scalable and efficient squeezed light generation, however, parasitic nonlinear processes and optical losses remain significant challenges. Here, we demonstrate single-mode quadrature squeezing in a photonic crystal microresonator via degenerate dual-pump spontaneous four-wave mixing. Implemented in a scalable, low-loss silicon-nitride photonic-chip platform, the microresonator features a tailored nano-corrugation that modifies its resonances to suppress parasitic nonlinear processes. In this way, we achieve an estimated 7.8 dB of on-chip squeezing in the bus waveguide, with potential for further improvement. These results open a promising pathway toward integrated squeezed light sources for quantum-enhanced interferometry, Gaussian boson sampling, coherent Ising machines, and universal quantum computing.

Here the authors use porous organic cages for separations with high selectivity at high concentrations. 
 Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) based on homochiral microporous materials have emerged as a promising approach for enantioselective separation. However, constructing MMMs for achieving efficient enantioselective separation at a high feed concentration still remains a great challenge due to the suboptimal interfacial compatibility. Here, we employ soluble porous organic cages (POCs) of intrinsic chiral sites as fillers to fabricate MMMs devoid of interfacial defects, exhibiting fast and selective enantioseparation for racemic 2-phenylpropionic acid with a flux of 2.93×10-3 mol m-2 h-1 and an enantiomeric excess (ee) value up to 100% at a high concentration of 0.1 mol L-1. The POC-based MMMs demonstrate a long-term operation stability with a low ee decline rate of 0.56% h-1. This work reveals the imperative role of the microporous chiral environment in POCs for the enantioselective recognition and furnishes guidelines for the construction of POC-based membranes for efficient chiral separation.

Here, the authors show that combined PARP and ATR inhibition triggers ZBP1-dependent PANoptosis in cancer and normal cells, revealing a mechanism to balance efficacy and toxicity in DDR inhibitor therapies. 
 The combination of DNA damage response inhibitors (DDR inhibitors) has emerged as a promising strategy for anticancer therapy. Herein, we demonstrate that the combined administration of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) inhibitors elicits PANoptosis across diverse cellular lineages, including non-cancerous cell populations. The induction of PANoptosis is dependent on mitotic entry and ZBP1-dependent PANoptosome (ZBP1-RIPK1-Caspase8-Caspase6). We identify the Aurora kinase B (AURKB) as the upstream regulator, essential for phosphorylation of ZBP1 which impacts ZBP1-dependent PANoptosome assembly and activation. The Trp53-/- Brca1-/- model of ID8 and two patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models further confirm the occurrence of PANoptosis following combination administration in vivo. The toxicity is mitigated in ZBP1-knockout mice. This study unveils a mechanism that dictates cell fate during DDR inhibitors-induced aberrant mitosis, emphasizing the critical balance between efficacy and safety in optimizing DDR inhibitors combination therapies.

 The multiplexity of current antibody-based imaging is limited by the number of reporters that can be detected simultaneously. Compressed sensing can be used to reconstruct high-dimensional information from low-dimensional measurements. Previously, compressed sensing using composite in situ imaging (CISI) of transcriptomic data leveraged gene co-regulation structure to recover spatial expression of 37 RNA species from images of 11 composite channels. Here, we extend the CISI framework to protein expression data measured by imaging mass cytometry (IMC). CISI-IMC accurately recovers spatial expression of 16 immune and stromal marker proteins from images of 8 composite channels with an average Pearson’s correlation of 0.8 across protein. Training the CISI-IMC framework using data collected on multiple human tissues enables universal decompression of composite data from a wide range of tumor and healthy tissue types. The expression dictionary and barcoding matrix described here are immediately implementable for general immune and stromal cell type classification, but CISI-IMC can in principle be applied to other markers or other antibody-based imaging methods.

They show that short-distance shifts towards dense vegetation or vertically downwards in canopies reduce velocities, highlighting that structurally complex ecosystems may provide short-term climate refuges. 
 Climate velocity—the speed and direction species must move to track climate change—is often estimated without accounting for vegetation-driven microclimatic variation. Using mechanistic microclimate models parameterized with three-dimensional maps of topography and vegetation structure, here we show that microclimate heterogeneity reduces the magnitude and alters the direction of climate velocity for maximum and minimum temperatures. For understory-dwelling organisms, the magnitude of maximum temperature velocity was halved and generally oriented towards areas with dense vegetation. For canopy-dwelling organisms, the magnitude of maximum temperature velocity was nearly zero, with vectors oriented vertically downward. These results demonstrate that vegetation complexity produces localized microrefugia, enabling short-term persistence of species under warming conditions. Our findings emphasize the need to integrate fine-scale habitat heterogeneity into predictions of climate resilience and highlight the value of structurally complex forests in providing microclimatic refugia.

This capability provides a direct means to quantify the spatial heterogeneity of subsurface chlorophyll maximum layers, shifting the characterization of the ocean’s carbon cycle from an inferred picture to a directly observed reality. Our work provides a technological basis for next-generation of space-based missions to monitor the ocean’s interior. An airborne blue lidar system, utilising a deep-penetrating blue laser (486 nm) and a hybrid detector can produce high-resolution profiles of chlorophyll architecture down to 100 meters depth, according to lidar campaigns in the South China Sea."

 Urban vertical growth has emerged as a crucial strategy for China. However, its potential impacts on cropland protection and global food security have not been thoroughly evaluated. This study compares the modes of urban vertical growth in China, the United States, Europe and other Asian countries, based on the definition of city boundaries. It further examines how China’s urban vertical growth can protect cropland resources and its impact on global food security under different scenarios. The results indicate that if China adopted the urban development scenarios of other regions, food production would decrease by 7.6–13.7% in 2020. This could potentially cause a reduction of 8.4–15.3% in the global grain trade volume, and the global prevalence of undernourishment would also increase. China’s urban vertical growth has effectively contributed to global food security and thereby supports the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal of Zero Hunger. Vertical growth of Chinese cities contributes more effectively to global food security than urban development in the United States, Europe, and other Asian countries, based on urban expansion simulations."

 Catastrophic earthquakes have struck along the East Anatolian Fault (EAF), including the 2020 Elaziğ earthquake and the 2023 Kahramanmaraş earthquake doublet. We integrated ground velocity from 2015-2020, together with co- and post-seismic deformation from the 2020 and 2023 earthquakes to investigate the fault slip evolution of the EAF, aiming to reveal the potential future seismic hazards. The spatiotemporally continuous deformation field allows us to derive complete slip distribution models throughout the earthquake cycle, including an interseismic period, two distinct postseismic periods, and three coseismic events. The results demonstrate that the slip patterns exhibit complementary characteristics across the interseismic, coseismic, and postseismic phases. Additionally, by integrating historical earthquake records with the strain accumulated and released during the observation period and quantifying the corresponding slip deficits, we evaluated the seismic potential of the EAF. Among these, the Palu segment emerged as having particularly high seismic risk, emphasizing the need for close monitoring.

 A better understanding of country-scale anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions and natural flux estimates and the carbon-climate feedback, is critical in formulating national climate policies to attain net zero emissions. Here, we use the atmospheric carbon dioxide column observations from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 satellite to unravel the response of the Indian land biosphere to global climatic phenomena such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation and Indian Ocean Dipole. An ensemble of global flux inverse models constrained by satellite observations indicates a reduction in carbon uptake by the Indian land biosphere during El Niño and an enhanced uptake during La Niña and positive Indian Ocean Dipole events. We find that the large Gross Primary Production variations, as compared to total ecosystem respiration, determined the response of flux variability to climatic phenomena. The carbon-climate constraints imposed by satellite observations over India help elucidate how biospheric uptake may offset anthropogenic emissions in the future.

 Recent reports on anomalously large ozone holes imply the uncertainty of the Antarctic ozone recovery. This study demonstrates that the sea surface temperature trends during this century hinder this recovery, despite declining ozone-depleting substances. Observations show a significant recovery of the polar mean total column ozone in September during 2000-2021, contrasted by robust ozone loss in the South Pacific middle stratosphere during October-November. Numerical experiments reveal that ozone-depleting substance reduction alone drives significant Antarctic ozone recovery throughout austral spring. However, superimposing observed sea surface temperature linear increments causes significant stratospheric ozone decreases over the South Pacific in October-November and reduces the spring mean recovery by approximately 46%. Both reanalysis data and simulations indicate that sea surface temperature forcing weakens Antarctic stratospheric planetary wave activity, causing regional cooling and nitric acid loss. These changes increase the ratios between the active halogens and the halogen reservoirs, thereby promoting ozone depletion. Recent sea surface temperature trends weaken Antarctic stratospheric planetary wave activity, reducing atmospheric nitric acid and promoting ozone depletion, according to analyses of observations, reanalysis data, and model simulations."

 Improving Urban Land Use Efficiency (LUE) can curb urban sprawl, protect farmland and ecological spaces, and promote low-carbon, intensive development models. Although numerous studies have been conducted, uncertainty and bias in LUE assessments—stemming from data sources, LUE calculations, and trend analysis methodology—has rarely been investigated. After a series of tests, here we propose a reliable, comprehensive, and equitable framework, which uses Built-Up Area per capita (BUP) metrics and provincial population data, along with time-series analysis tools, to assess LUE trends. Our global evaluation reveals that 79.6% of provinces saw significant BUP growth from 1985 to 2020, with an average increase of 15 m² per capita per five years - a trend that challenges progress toward Sustainable Development Goal 11.3. Considerable—and widening—disparities in BUP are observed across provinces and countries. In 2020, the BUP in some high-income countries was thirty times greater than in low-income countries, while the latter exhibited higher BUP growth rates—likely due to their smaller initial base. However, they could still be considered inefficient in land use if assessed solely based on growth rate metrics.

 Eruptions at continental basaltic volcanoes can take and combine various forms, including lava lakes, lava flows and fountaining, explosions or structural collapses. Aside from a few well-instrumented cases worldwide, accurately reconstructing eruptive scenarios is hampered by the lack of detailed visual observations. However, volcanoes also have their own acoustic signatures composed of low-pitched inaudible sounds, called infrasounds. Here we analyze infrasound records close to Nyiragongo volcano (D.R. Congo) ( <20 km) up to Kenya ( ~800 km), which are converted using acoustic numerical modeling into time-lapse observations of the catastrophic drainage of the world’s largest lava lake on 22 May 2021. The emitted infrasounds also enable tracking of fissure openings and lava eruptions along the flank, occurring simultaneously with the lava lake drainage. This striking example supports the growing role of infrasound as a key component of volcano monitoring and early-warning systems, as it provides unique information inaccessible to other ground-based instruments.

 Atmospheric deposition plays an important role in the global distribution and long-range transport potential of micro- and nanoplastic particles. However, our mechanistic understanding of contributing processes remains limited. While similarities in wet and dry deposition processes can be expected between micro- and nanoplastics and well-studied natural and anthropogenic aerosols (e.g. mineral dust, pollen, black carbon), no holistic theoretical framework currently accounts for specific micro- and nanoplastic properties and their inherent heterogeneity. Here, we present an integrated mathematical model of atmospheric particle transport which incorporates micro- and nanoplastic properties (size, shape, density and surface characteristics, including effects of environmental ageing) based on theory and empirical data. We find that estimated micro- and nanoplastic half-lives in air can range from seconds to weeks, depending on particle characteristics, land surface type, surface wind speed, atmospheric stratification and precipitation. Micro- and nanoplastic particles with diameters of around 1 µm and fibres have the highest potential for long-range atmospheric transport.

 Buried lakes are widely distributed on the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) after summer. Some of these lakes may drain over winter, thereby delivering meltwater into the ice sheet and potentially influencing ice flow dynamics. However, to date, only a limited number of buried lake drainages (BLDs) have been identified and their spatiotemporal dynamics across the GrIS remain unclear. Here we detect pan-GrIS wintertime BLDs by integrating Sentinel-1 and -2 satellite imagery and ArcticDEM data. We begin by locating potential buried lakes with topographic depressions. Then we identify the depressions with significant wintertime backscatter increases as potential BLDs using Sentinel-1 SAR imagery. Next, we map the maximum summertime meltwater area using Sentinel-2 imagery and select the potential BLDs with sufficient summertime meltwater as final BLDs. Finally, we categorize these final BLDs into three types (complete BLDs, partial BLDs, and low-confidence BLDs), and we also investigate potential ice velocity anomalies (IVAs) triggered by BLDs using ice velocity data. The results show that: (1) 167 complete and partial BLDs are identified over seven winters from 2017 to 2023 on the GrIS, including 25 cascade drainages; their spatiotemporal distributions vary significantly, with most BLDs detected at the NW, CW, and SW basins in November. (2) Wintertime BLDs potentially trigger 10 significant IVAs (up to 50 %), and may lead to a net increase in annual ice motion. (3) Wintertime IVAs triggered by BLDs are significantly higher than summertime IVAs triggered by supraglacial lake drainages; they propagate downstream along subglacial hydrologic pathways rather than ice flowlines. (4) BLDs can even trigger rerouting of subglacial hydrologic pathways over a short time period. In conclusion, we present a new method of detecting sparse wintertime BLDs over large areas and reveal that BLDs have a more profound effect on ice flow dynamics than previously assumed."

The monitoring results indicated that mean odor unit (OU, dimensionless) values were higher in PMZs at night (10.2) than during the day (8.3) and on ambient routes (7.08). Seasonal peaks occurred in summer (July–August) and winter (December), corresponding to periods of low wind speeds and temperature inversions.

Lee,Extreme precipitation scaling under synoptic air mass regimes,"•GWTC-2 air masses (AMs) modulate extreme precipitation scaling by region and season. •The bin-shifting effect in Tropical stations is stronger in humid AMs than dry AMs. •Negative scaling rates dominate Mediterranean stations across most AMs. •Semi-arid stations are highly sensitive to warming, with super-CC driven by dynamics. •Dynamic amplification of extremes is most common during Warm Front passages. 
 Observed sensitivity of extreme precipitation to surface temperature (apparent scaling) often deviates markedly from the Clausius Clapeyron (CC) relation, and so cannot be used to reliably infer future changes in extreme precipitation under climate change (climate scaling). These deviations from the CC relation results from the superimposition of thermodynamic influences with those of diverse synoptic weather regimes when using the binning method. To disentangle these influences, this study stratifies by synoptic regime prior to scaling analysis. This novel approach employs the Gridded Weather Typing Classification version 2 (GWTC-2), a multivariate scheme that categorizes daily weather conditions into 11 distinct air masses. It is found that scaling precipitation against temperature produces rates that are skewed by the bin-shifting effect and moisture limitations at higher temperatures, especially in tropical regions. While scaling with dew point temperature corrects those limitations, it might overestimate the true response of precipitation to warming, as it more directly reflects moisture availability. Importantly, scaling rates behave differently under different synoptic air masses, which together potentially offers a more realistic range of scaling behaviors against which future extreme precipitation changes may be compared. Within GWTC-2-stratified scaling, we show that most sub-CC and super-CC scaling involve dynamical suppression or amplification of precipitation extremes, respectively. Also, warm front passages are the main synoptic conduit through which the dynamic contribution modulate extreme precipitation. Future work should evaluate climate scaling across diverse climate models and scenarios to determine whether GWTC-2–stratified scaling offers a reliable reference range for projecting extreme precipitation."

For the high-quality data, R is 0.44, with an RMSE as high as 9112 μg/m2; the poorest performance is observed in the medium and low-quality data, with an R of 0.21. In contrast, the constructed model increased R by 0.29 and decreased RMSE by 2396 μg/m2 across the entire dataset, with the number of sites showing good correlation improving by 34 %. For the high and medium-quality data, R ranged from 0.70 to 0.86, and the RMSE decreased by 1475—4569 μg/m2. In addition, MERRA-2 BCE column concentration and BC aerosol optical depth are the key factors in the model, while surface-level PM2.5, organic matter, and BC concentrations are also important variables. Spatiotemporal evolution analysis shows a high degree of spatial overlap between regions with elevated BC column concentrations and China's key national urban agglomerations as well as major energy corridors. From 2001 to 2023, the national BC column concentration exhibited a trend of initial increase followed by a steady decline, with an average annual decrease of 42.36 μg/m2. Significant emission reduction achievements were observed in the central and eastern regions, while high concentrations persist in the western region. This study provides a critical data and technical foundation for both regional climate research and atmospheric environmental governance."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108642,True,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文探讨了同化AMSR2卫星和GNSS地基观测的PWV数据对华南地区降雨预报的影响。研究表明，同化这些数据可以提高降雨预报的准确性和空间分布，尤其是在强降水事件中。该研究使用了三维变分数据同化（3DVAR）方法，并将这些数据整合到WRF数值天气预报模型中，从而改善了降雨预报性能。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是卫星观测和大气成分分析（水汽含量）在降雨预报中的应用。,"['Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV)', 'Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2)', 'Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)', 'rainfall prediction', 'satellite observations', 'water vapor']",Yangzhao Gong;Zhizhao Liu;Hong Liang;Yunchang Cao;Hui Su;Yuting Sun,Exploring the impacts of assimilating AMSR2 and GNSS PWV data on rainfall prediction in South China,"•Assimilating AMSR2 and GNSS PWV enhances the rainfall forecast scores. •The rainfall spatial pattern is appreciably improved after assimilating AMSR2 and GNSS PWV. •Assimilating a combination of AMSR2 and GNSS PWV generally outperforms assimilating either dataset individually. 
 Assimilating accurate water vapor observations is an effective way to enhance the rainfall forecasting performance of numerical weather prediction models. In this study, using the three-dimensional variational data assimilation (3DVAR) method, Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) data observed by two kinds of powerful water vapor instruments, i.e., the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) onboard the Global Change Observation Mission 1st–Water (GCOM-W1) satellite and the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), are assimilated into the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to enhance its rainfall forecasting capacity. The assimilation impacts of AMSR2 and GNSS PWV are comprehensively examined for the extreme rainfall events occurred in South China during the period of April 01 to 30, 2024. Assessed by the rainfall observations from the densely distributed automatic weather stations, our results indicate that assimilating AMSR2 and GNSS PWV improves rainfall forecasting performance in terms of both rainfall forecast scores and spatial patterns. For the intense-precipitation days, with a threshold of 150 mm accumulated rainfall within 24-h, assimilating AMSR2 PWV improves the equitable threat score (ETS) by up to 0.020 (26.3 % of improvement), while assimilating GNSS PWV improves the ETS by 0.021 (27.6 % of improvement). When both AMSR2 and GNSS PWV are assimilated, the ETS score increases by up to 0.030 (39.5 % of improvement)."
