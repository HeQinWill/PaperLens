10.1088/1748-9326/adbd58,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注气候变化对宏观经济的影响，而非直接涉及大气环境遥感技术。论文探讨了全球天气状况对经济增长的影响，并评估了气候变化对全球GDP的潜在损害。虽然气候变化与大气环境密切相关，但该研究的重点在于经济模型和政策影响，而不是使用遥感技术进行大气成分分析或空气质量监测。,[],Timothy Neal;Ben R Newell;Andy Pitman,Reconsidering the macroeconomic damage of severe warming,"Projections of macroeconomic damage from future climate change tend to suggest mild to moderate impacts. This can lead to welfare-optimal climate policies in integrated assessment models (IAMs) that recommend very slow emissions reductions over the coming decades, in sharp contrast with the ambitions of the Paris Agreement. These econometric models assume that weather impacting a single country is all that affects the economy of that country. We examine whether the addition of global weather conditions in the empirical modelling of economic growth affects the projections of the impact of climate change on global gross domestic product (GDP). In effect, we explore whether the interconnectedness of the global economy makes individual countries vulnerable to weather changes that impact other countries. Using three influential econometric models we add global weather to the regressions. We find that this leads to significant worsening of the projections of macroeconomic damage for given future emissions scenarios. Damage to world GDP in 2100 under SSP5-8.5, averaged across both econometric models and climate models increases from ∼11% under models without global weather to ∼40% if global weather is included. Further, we demonstrate that when the damage function used in a recent IAM is estimated from empirical models augmented with global weather conditions, they reduce the welfare-optimal amount of climate change from ∼2.7 C to ∼1.7 C which is consistent with the Paris Agreement targets. Our results highlight the need for econometric modelling and climate science’s understanding of extreme events to be integrated much more consistently to ensure the costs of climate change are not underestimated."

While existing studies highlight the technological complexities, flexibility challenges, and cost implications of achieving carbon neutrality, mitigating the last 10%–20% of power system emissions in China has not been sufficiently addressed. Here, we estimate the impacts of eliminating the last 10%–20% of CO2 emissions on new capacity, the transmission network, system costs, and climate and public health benefits. We find that although system costs slightly increase (less than 1%) under deep decarbonization in China, climate and health benefits are substantial. We further investigate the role of three important emission mitigation technologies (nuclear, offshore wind, and carbon capture and storage) in power system deep decarbonization. Our analysis shows that none of these technologies would significantly affect future system costs but they influence both the quantity and location of renewable energy installations and the expansion of China’s transmission network. With China’s power system, the world’s largest, we demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of achieving a net-zero electricity sector and offer insights on implications for renewable development and transmission expansion when prioritizing decarbonization technologies."
10.5194/acp-25-3753-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了大气中氯乙酸的生成机制，重点关注挥发性有机化合物与氯化学反应的多相过程。研究结合了现场观测、量子化学计算和箱式模型模拟，发现异戊二烯及其氧化产物是氯乙酸的重要前体，并提出了氯乙醛等多相反应对氯乙酸生成的贡献。虽然论文没有直接涉及遥感技术或卫星观测，但它深入研究了大气成分和空气质量相关的化学过程，特别是氯乙酸这种大气污染物，因此与大气环境遥感技术领域具有相关性。遥感技术可以用于监测VOCs的浓度，从而间接支持对氯乙酸生成机制的理解。,"['chloroacetic acid', 'Cl-OVOCs', 'volatile organic compounds (VOCs)', 'chlorine chemistry', 'multiphase processes', 'air quality', 'atmospheric composition']",Mingxue Li;Men Xia;Chunshui Lin;Yifan Jiang;Weihang Sun;Yurun Wang;Yingnan Zhang;Maoxia He;Tao Wang,Mechanistic insights into chloroacetic acid production from atmospheric multiphase volatile organic compound–chlorine chemistry,"Our field campaigns observed a strong diel pattern of chloroacetic acid as well as a strong correlation between its level and that of reactive chlorine species at a coastal site. Using quantum chemical calculations and box model simulation with an updated Master Chemical Mechanism, we found that the formation pathway of chloroacetic acid involved multiphase processes. Our study enhances understanding of atmospheric organic chlorine chemistry and emphasizes the importance of multiphase reactions. 
 Chlorine-containing oxygenated volatile organic compounds (Cl-OVOCs) are indicators of atmospheric chlorine chemistry involving volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, their formation mechanisms are insufficiently understood. Herein, a strong diel pattern of chloroacetic acid (C2H3O2Cl) was observed with daytime peaks at 19 and 13 ppt (1 h averages) in 2020 and 2021, respectively, at a coastal site in southern China. Ethene was previously proposed as the primary precursor responsible for daytime C2H3O2Cl levels, but a photochemical box model based on Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) simulations indicates that ethene accounts for less than 1 %. Quantum chemical calculations suggest that other alkenes also can act as chloroacetic acid precursors. Using an updated gas-phase VOC–Cl chemistry model, we find that isoprene, the most abundant VOC at the sampling site, along with its oxidation products, accounts for 7 % of the observed C2H3O2Cl.  Moreover, the simulation with the updated MCM produces appreciable levels of other Cl-OVOCs, especially chloroacetaldehyde, a precursor of C2H3O2Cl. We proposed the multiphase reaction of Cl-OVOCs to reconcile the overestimation of Cl-OVOCs and the underestimation of C2H3O2Cl in our gas-phase model. The estimated reactive uptake coefficients for various Cl-OVOCs range from 3.63×10-5 to 2.34×10-2, based on quantum chemical calculations and linear relationship modelling. The box model simulation with multiphase chemistry shows that the heterogeneous conversion of chloroacetaldehyde to C2H3O2Cl can contribute 24 %–48 % of the observed levels. Our study thus proposes a formation mechanism of gaseous C2H3O2Cl and highlights the potential importance of multiphase processes in atmospheric organic acid formation."

They are used worldwide to help assess the trace gas exchange, critical to understanding climate change. However, their physical framework interferes with the flow they measure. We present a new way of correcting measurements from sonic anemometers of several types. The method uses measurements of vertical wind velocity and other turbulent velocities, compares their ratios, and from this yields correction factors for sonic anemometers. 
 Non-orthogonal sonic anemometers are used extensively in flux networks and biomicrometeorological research. Previous studies have hypothesized potential underestimation of the vertical velocity turbulent perturbations, necessitating correction to increase flux measurements by approximately 10 %, while some studies have refuted that any correction is needed. Those studies have used cross-comparisons between sonic anemometers and numerical simulations. Here we propose a method that yields a correction factor for vertical velocity that requires only a single sonic anemometer in situ but requires some assumptions and adequate fetch at a sufficient distance above roughness elements where surface similarity is valid. Correction factors could be important in adjusting flux network and other flux data, as well as assessing the energy budget closure that is used as one of the flux data quality measures. The correction factor is confirmed in one field experiment and comparison between a CSAT3 and RMY 81000VRE, but it does not work well for the more complex form factors shown in a field comparison of an IRGAson and a CSAT3a."

The distinction between these processes can be achieved using lidar or spectral techniques, as demonstrated in the case studies. The capability of the new method to identify rimed particles and aggregates without differentiating them can simplify statistical work. 
 Advancing the understanding of mixed-phase cloud microphysical growth processes requires a thorough detection of the transition processes from pristine hydrometeor states toward aggregates, rimed particles and graupel. In this study,  a versatile combination of techniques is applied to detect and characterize aggregated and strongly rimed hydrometeors even under adverse atmospheric conditions, such as the presence of orographic gravity waves. This approach combines dual-frequency observations from vertical-stare Doppler cloud radars and measurements from a polarimetric scanning cloud radar. The core of the approach is to use profiles of the vertical distribution of particle shape (VDPS) method that serve as a proxy for identifying the presence of oblate, isometric or prolate cloud particles. At height levels within the VDPS-based shape profiles where isometric particles are identified, Doppler spectra and dual-wavelength vertical-stare cloud radar observations are used to discriminate between the occurrence of aggregation and graupel formation.The underlying dataset was acquired in the framework of the 3-year field experiment Dynamics, Aerosol, Cloud and Precipitation Observations in the Pristine Environment of the Southern Ocean (DACAPO-PESO) at the southern hemispheric midlatitude site of Punta Arenas, Chile (53° S, 71° W). The frequent presence of layers of supercooled liquid water and the permanent occurrence of orographic gravity waves motivate a strong interest to understand the formation of precipitation and the role of aggregation and riming at this site. Therefore, two case studies representing both processes, strong riming events and aggregation, from the DACAPO-PESO campaign are presented to demonstrate the potential of combining the new VDPS retrieval with spectral methods, which analyze particle fall velocity and the coexistence of multiple particle types. We found that the identification of layers of supercooled liquid water is essential to pin down regions of riming in the observed cloud systems. In consequence, considering the general notion of the excess of liquid water in clouds over the Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes, our study serves as a preliminary investigation into the occurrence of riming and aggregation processes above Punta Arenas."

By studying them, we can learn about past environments, sea level and climate changes, and where the sediments came from. To aid in understanding the geology, georesources, and potential hazards in the Iberian Peninsula and its surrounding seas, we present the SedDARE-IB sediment data repository. As an application in geothermal exploration, we investigate how sediment thickness affects the depth of the 150 °C isotherm. 
 Sediments provide valuable information for geologists and geophysicists whenever they strive to understand, and reproduce, the geological evolution, lithology, rock properties, seismic response, and geohazards of a region. The analysis of sedimentary sequences is thus useful for the interpretation of depositional environments, sea-level change, climate change, and recognition of the sediments' source areas. By integrating sedimentary data into geophysical modeling, such interpretations are improved in terms of their accuracy and reliability. To further help our understanding of the Iberian Peninsula's geological evolution, geological resources, and geohazards, this work presents to the scientific community the SedDARE-IB data repository. This repository includes available data on the depth to the Base of the Cenozoic and Top of the Paleozoic stratigraphic markers for the Iberian Peninsula, the surrounding West Iberian Atlantic Margin and Western Mediterranean Neogene basins, or the acoustic basement as interpreted for the Valencia Trough and Alboran Mediterranean basins. As an example of the broad applicability of the data included in SedDARE-IB, we investigate how sediment thickness affects the depth to the 150 °C isotherm in specific basins, as commonly used in geothermal exploration. The calculated trend suggests that, given constant measured surface heat flow and thermal conductivity, the 150 °C isotherm becomes shallower as the sediment thickness increases, until a critical threshold value is reached for the latter. The SedDARE-IB database has been compiled thanks to a Portuguese–Spanish collaboration promoting open data exchange among institutions and research groups. SedDARE-IB is freely available at https://doi.org/10.20350/digitalCSIC/16277 (Torne et al., 2024), bringing opportunities to the scientific, industrial, and educational communities for diverse applications."

We reconstructed past vegetation cover on the Tibetan Plateau, a climate-sensitive and ecologically vital region, using machine learning. This spatiotemporal dataset, spanning 16,000 years, reveals vegetation changes and improves understanding of climate dynamics. It also provides crucial data for climate models to simulate past and future impacts, enhancing predictions of vegetation-climate feedbacks. 
 Spatiotemporally contiguous paleo-vegetation reconstructions are essential for studying climate-vegetation interactions, providing critical data for paleoclimate modeling, and refining past land cover in Earth System Models (ESMs) and scenarios of anthropogenic land-cover changes (ALCCs). Here, we present the first spatiotemporally contiguous paleo-vegetation cover dataset for the Tibetan Plateau, spanning from the last deglaciation (16 ka) to the preindustrial era. This dataset was achieved using two sets of random forest (RF) models: one focused on temporal reconstructions (RF-temporal) and the other on spatial reconstructions (RF-spatial). RF-temporal reconstructs temporal trends from 61 fossil pollen records across the Tibetan Plateau, while RF-spatial interpolates site-based cover, producing a dataset with a spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.5° and a temporal resolution of 400 years. The dataset provides estimates of vegetation cover, along with standard errors, for three vegetation types (vegetation, woody plant, and herbaceous plant). To illustrate, we present the temporal trends and spatial distribution of vegetation cover for these vegetation types, comparing them with the vegetation cover used in ESMs. We further discuss the dataset’s reliability and applications, along with the discrepancies between our reconstructed results and those used in ESMs, highlighting possible reasons for these differences."

Through comparison and cross-validation with other data sources, this dataset has been proven to have significant advantages in accuracy and applicability. 
 Ecosystem services are the various benefits provided by ecosystems to humans, establishing a crucial link between the natural environment and human well-being. High-resolution ecosystem service datasets can provide more detailed and accurate information, enabling the identification of site-specific differences at local scales. In this study, we produced a high spatial resolution dataset of ecosystem services in China from 2000 to 2020, simulated using ecological process models. Model parameters were calibrated based on literature summaries, ground monitoring data, and reconstructed remote sensing data. The dataset, with a spatial resolution of 30 meters, includes net primary productivity, soil conservation, sandstorm prevention, and water yield. The validation results show high consistency between this ecosystem services dataset and both in situ observations and existing datasets. From 2000 to 2020, the overall trends for net primary productivity, soil conservation, and sandstorm prevention in China showed a weak increase, while water yield decreased during this period.

 This study investigates the long-term monitoring of physico-chemical parameters and biogeochemical cycles in coastal ecosystems, focusing on three stations in Normandy: Blainville-sur-Mer, Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue, and Utah Beach. Over a 24-year period, we analyzed trends in temperature, pH, chlorophyll a concentrations, and nutrient levels, aiming to assess the impacts of climate change and human activities on marine ecosystems. Results show a consistent rise in winter temperatures, particularly since 2013, alongside increasing ocean acidification, especially at Blainville-sur-Mer. These trends suggest potential consequences for planktonic communities and mollusk health. Nutrient analysis revealed significant variations, including high ammonium concentrations on the East coast and a gradual decline in phosphates over the last 15 years, highlighting the influence of anthropogenic activities. The study also identified nutrient limitations, with phosphorus dominating the East coast and nitrogen on the West coast. Our findings emphasize the need for effective nutrient management strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change and human impact, ensuring the sustainability of coastal ecosystems and aquaculture practices.

Knowledge of these organics remains limited as traditional targeted analyses potentially overlook important molecules and their atmospheric impacts. Here, we employed comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC-TOFMS) to analyze the molecular compositions of organics in CPM from typical ultralow emission coal-fired power plants and iron and steel sintering plants in China. We established a nontargeted screening approach to obtain molecular fingerprints of these organics, identifying more than 180 and 200 compounds from over 1000 peaks from the two types of plants. Key contributors to CPM organics include substituted benzenes, polyfunctional aliphatic compounds, alkanes, and cycloalkanes, differing from the previously reported alkane dominance observed using traditional one-dimensional GC analysis. Intermediate/semivolatile organic compounds (I/SVOCs) dominate organics in CPM, with a significant fraction of low volatile organic compounds detected especially in iron and steel sintering plant emissions. Iron and steel sintering plants emit higher concentrations of organics in CPM, particularly aromatics, due to their lower combustion efficiency in the sintering processes. These findings enhance our understanding of the atmospheric behavior of organics in CPM and their impacts on air quality."

The assessments of extreme events often rely on percentile‐based indices using a 30‐year baseline period. In China, the Blue Book on Climate Change has traditionally been based on the 1981–2010 baseline period, and it began to use the 1991–2020 baseline period since 2024. However, the impact of baseline changes on assessing extremes in China remains unclear. This study examines how baseline period updates influence the detection of long‐term climate change in China, particularly in estimating the Time of Emergence (ToE) for climate change signals. The results show that for temperature extremes, updating the baseline period leads to more (10%∼38%) cold extremes identified by 10th percentile indices and fewer (−32%∼−11%) warm extremes identified by 90th percentile indices across China. It slows the increase in identified warm extremes and accelerates the decrease in cold extremes. It delays the ToE for warm events and advances the ToE for cold events. For precipitation extremes, the update leads to fewer (−12%∼−1%) but more intense (at most 4%) extreme precipitation events identified by 95th and 99th percentile indices across China with slower increases in frequency and faster rises in intensity. The baseline period update advances the ToE for extreme precipitation intensity and delays it for frequency. The update of the baseline significantly affects the assessment of changes in climate extremes in China due to the background warming and wetting in 1991–2020 compared to 1981–2010."

In this study, we explored the boreal summer meridional quadrupolar rainfall changes in eastern China during the AA period, distributed as positive‐negative‐positive‐negative anomaly pattern form north to south in eastern China. This pattern is significantly linked with the heterogeneous variations of the polar front jet (PJ) and subtropical jet (SJ), as the PJ displaced poleward over the Eurasia and the SJ displaced equatorward from the North Atlantic to East Asia. Such movement of different branches of jets are referred as the wavier jets that can be maintained by the negative phase of East Atlantic‐Europe Pacific teleconnection (−EAUP), which might be associated with the positive phase of the Victoria mode over the North Pacific, the tripole sea surface temperature mode over the North Atlantic, and the reduction of sea ice concentration over Arctic.

Direct deposition measurements are generally more reliable at local scale than dust deposition models, even those based on aerosol concentration measurements. Whatever the scale, relevant local observations are necessary for model evaluation. We present here the results obtained by direct measurement of atmospheric aerosols and total atmospheric deposition using a 14‐month time series from the Caribbean region. Total deposition velocity, lifetime, and scavenging ratio of major and trace elements were determined. Comparing total deposition fluxes of aluminum (dust proxy) and sea‐salt sodium (sea‐salt proxy) with Community Atmosphere Model (CAM6) outputs shows that the modeled total deposition rate is underestimated by a factor of two for dust and by a factor of eight for sea salt, while model aerosol concentration is larger than concentration measured near ground level. This result is due to wet deposition being underestimated in the model. The scavenging ratio (w/w) of Saharan dust elements ranges from 95 to 1,390, with a median of 530, close to the geometric mean value of 513. Sea salt presents a greater range of scavenging ratio values, from 325 to 2,355, with a median of 1,180, close to the geometric mean value of 1,030.

E. Roelvink;G. Masselink;C. Stokes;R. T. McCall,Climate Adaptation for a Natural Atoll Island in the Maldives ‐ Predicting the Long‐Term Morphological Response of Coral Islands to Sea Level Rise and the Effect of Hazard Mitigation Strategies,"Coral atoll islands, common in (sub)tropical oceans, consist of low‐lying accumulations of carbonate sediment produced by fringing coral reef systems and are of great socio‐economic and ecological importance. Previous studies have predicted that many atoll islands will become uninhabitable before the end of this century due to sea level rise exacerbating wave‐driven flooding. However, the assumption that such islands are morphologically static has been challenged by observations and modeling that show the potential for overwashing and sediment deposition to maintain island freeboard. Reliable long‐term predictions of island change and future flood risk, essential for adaptation planning, are, however, lacking. Here, we adopt a novel, efficient approach for modeling the long‐term island response and illustrate the morphological response of an atoll island to future sea level rise and the effect of various adaptation measures. We demonstrate that wave‐driven sediment deposition increases island (beach) crest freeboard. We find that the assumption of static island morphology leads to a significant increase in the predicted frequency of future island flooding compared to morphodynamically active islands. Reef adaptation measures were shown to modify the inshore wave energy, influencing the equilibrium island crest height and therefore the long‐term morphological response of the island, while beach restoration mainly delays the island's response. Accounting for long‐term natural island dynamics, including the morphodynamic feedback from adaptation measures, offers more realistic projections of future flood risk compared to current static island model predictions. These local projections of island response can serve as decision support tools for climate adaptation."

The Fisheries and Marine Ecosystems Model Intercomparison Project (FishMIP) uses an ensemble modeling approach to fill this crucial gap. Yet FishMIP does not have a standardised skill assessment framework to quantify the ability of member models to reproduce past observations and to guide model improvement. In this study, we apply a comprehensive model skill assessment framework to a subset of global FishMIP models that produce historical fisheries catches. We consider a suite of metrics and assess their utility in illustrating the models' ability to reproduce observed fisheries catches. Our findings reveal improvement in model performance at both global and regional (Large Marine Ecosystem) scales from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 and 6 simulation rounds. Our analysis underscores the importance of employing easily interpretable, relative skill metrics to estimate the capability of models to capture temporal variations, alongside absolute error measures to characterize shifts in the magnitude of these variations between models and across simulation rounds. The skill assessment framework developed and tested here provides a first objective assessment and a baseline of the FishMIP ensemble's skill in reproducing historical catch at the global and regional scale. This assessment can be further improved and systematically applied to test the reliability of FishMIP models across the whole model ensemble from future simulation rounds and include more variables like fish biomass or production."

 El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, whether in warm or cold phases, that persist for two or more consecutive years (multi-year), are relatively rare. Compared with single-year events, they create cumulative impacts and are linked to extended periods of extreme weather worldwide. Here we combine central Pacific fossil coral oxygen isotope reconstructions with a multimodel ensemble of transient Holocene global climate simulations to investigate the multi-year ENSO evolution during the Holocene (beginning ~11,700 years ago), when the global climate was relatively stable and driven mainly by seasonal insolation. We find that, over the past ~7,000 years, in proxies the ratio of multi-year to single-year ENSO events increased by a factor of 5, associated with a longer ENSO period (from 3.5 to 4.1 years). This change is verified qualitatively by a subset of model simulations with a more realistic representation of ENSO periodicity. More frequent multi-year ENSO events and prolonged ENSO periods are being caused by a shallower thermocline and stronger upper-ocean stratification in the Tropical Eastern Pacific in the present day. The sensitivity of the ENSO duration to orbital forcing signals the urgency of minimizing other anthropogenic influence that may accelerate this long-term trend towards more persistent ENSO damages.

 Catalytic methods to couple alkynes and alkenes are highly valuable in synthetic chemistry. The cobalt-catalyzed intermolecular reductive coupling of alkenes and alkynes is particularly attractive due to the unique reactivity and cost-effectiveness of cobalt catalysts. However, the enantioselective transformations of this kind are less developed. The limited successful enantioselective examples are restricted to the use of electronically biased activated olefins as the coupling partners. Herein, we report an asymmetric desymmetric reductive coupling of electronically unbiased succinimide-containing cyclobutenes with alkynes to synthesize enantioenriched, synthetically important vinyl cyclobutanes via photoredox and cobalt dual catalysis. Excellent enantioselectivities, good diastereoselectivities and regioselectivities are obtained. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that Hantzsch ester is a better reducing reagent when used in combination with Et3N.

 Millennial-scale variations in the strength and position of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current exert considerable influence on the global meridional overturning circulation and the ocean carbon cycle. The mechanistic understanding of these variations is still incomplete, partly due to the scarcity of sediment records covering multiple glacial-interglacial cycles with millennial-scale resolution. Here, we present high-resolution current strength and sea surface temperature records covering the past 790,000 years from the Cape Horn Current as part of the subantarctic Antarctic Circumpolar Current system, flowing along the Chilean margin. Both temperature and current velocity data document persistent millennial-scale climate variability throughout the last eight glacial periods with stronger current flow and warmer sea surface temperatures coinciding with Antarctic warm intervals. These Southern Hemisphere changes are linked to North Atlantic millennial-scale climate fluctuations, plausibly involving changes in the Atlantic thermohaline circulation.

Here, the authors show that pathogenic Shigella flexneri can use its effector IpaH1.4 to directly target and subvert RNF213 to evade host antibacterial immunity. 
 Ubiquitination plays vital roles in modulating pathogen-host cell interactions. RNF213, a E3 ligase, can catalyze the ubiquitination of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and is crucial for antibacterial immunity in mammals. Shigella flexneri, an LPS-containing pathogenic bacterium, has developed mechanisms to evade host antibacterial defenses during infection. However, the precise strategies by which S. flexneri circumvents RNF213-mediated antibacterial immunity remain poorly understood. Here, through comprehensive biochemical, structural and cellular analyses, we reveal that the E3 effector IpaH1.4 of S. flexneri can directly target human RNF213 via a specific interaction between the IpaH1.4 LRR domain and the RING domain of RNF213, and mediate the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of RNF213 in cells. Furthermore, we determine the cryo-EM structure of human RNF213 and the crystal structure of the IpaH1.4 LRR/RNF213 RING complex, elucidating the molecular mechanism underlying the specific recognition of RNF213 by IpaH1.4. Finally, our cell based functional assays demonstrate that the targeting of host RNF213 by IpaH1.4 promotes S. flexneri proliferation within infected cells. In summary, our work uncovers an unprecedented strategy employed by S. flexneri to subvert the key host immune factor RNF213, thereby facilitating bacterial proliferation during invasion.

 The global outbreak of monkeypox virus (MPXV), combined with the termination of smallpox vaccination and the lack of specific antiviral treatments, raises increasing concerns. The surface proteins M1R and B6R of MPXV are crucial for virus transmission and serve as key targets for vaccine development. In this study, a panel of human antibodies targeting M1R and B6R is isolated from a human antibody library using phage display technology. Among these antibodies, A138 against M1R and B026 against B6R show the most potent broad-spectrum neutralizing activities against MPXV and Vaccinia virus (VACV). When used in combination, A138 and B026 exhibit complementary neutralizing activity against both viruses in vitro. X-ray crystallography reveales that A138 binds to the loop regions of M1R, similar to the vulnerable epitope of 7D11 on VACV L1R. By contrast, A129 targets a more cryptic epitope, primarily comprising the β-strands of M1R. Moreover, prophylactic and therapeutic administration of A138 or B026 alone provides partial protection, while combining these two antibodies results in enhanced protection against VACV in male C57BL/6 mice. This study demonstrates of a dual-targeting strategy using two different components of the virion for the prevention and treatment of MPXV infection.

 Allogeneic transplantation of CCR5 null hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) is the only known cure for HIV-1 infection. However, this treatment is limited because of the rarity of CCR5-null matched donors, the morbidities associated with allogeneic transplantation, and the prevalence of HIV-1 strains resistant to CCR5 knockout (KO) alone. Here, we propose a one-time therapy through autologous transplantation of HSPCs genetically engineered ex vivo to produce both CCR5 KO cells and long-term secretion of potent HIV-1 inhibiting antibodies from B cell progeny.

 Reduced snow cover is becoming increasingly common in the Arctic-Boreal region under amplified warming, complicating efforts to isolate its specific impacts on plant productivity during the subsequent snow-free seasons. Here, we compiled a multi-source remote sensing dataset to disentangle the effects of warming-independent reduced snow cover across the northern permafrost region over the past 30 years. In years with shortened snow cover duration but normal climate conditions, gross primary productivity increased by a rate of 1.48 g C m−2 for every 10-day shortened snow cover duration and normalized difference vegetation index of 0.0024 in regions with increased soil temperature compared to the long-term mean. This productivity boost was primarily driven by shortened snow cover duration and early snowmelt, which enhanced soil heat uptake, accelerated permafrost thaw, and improved plant water and nutrient availability, thereby advancing spring greening. This study offers valuable insights into Arctic-Boreal climate feedback under a warming climate.

 Accurate estimation of terrestrial ecosystem respiration (TER) is essential for refining global carbon budgets. Current large-scale TER models rely on empirical structures derived from site-scale observations, often driven solely by hydrothermal factors. However, incorporating ecosystem-scale information is critical for more accurate large-scale TER modeling. Such ecosystem-scale variables have not been well parameterized, since the mechanisms by which they affect TER remain unclear. To address this gap, here we developed a Causality constrained Interpretable Machine Learning model for TER estimation (named “CIML-TER”) which consider the ecosystem-scale information. CIML-TER exhibited higher estimation accuracy (reducing relative mean absolute error by approximately 15%) and overcame the “artificial discontinuities” phenomenon of traditional models. Meanwhile, we quantitatively revealed that although environmental factors, such as temperature and water, were still the dominant drivers of TER (contributing ~44.15% of global TER variability), biotic factors (e.g., vegetation structure, ~25.91%) and spatiotemporal variation factors (e.g., land cover and phenology, ~29.94%) were also critical.

 This study investigated the source characteristics of submicron non-refractory particulate matter (NR-PM1) over a highly growing urban industrial city near the western coast of India. Using a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS), we conducted continuous measurements from June 2020 to May 2021, capturing seasonal variations in aerosol composition. The annual average NR-PM1 concentration was 16.4 ± 15.4 μg m−3, with substantially higher concentrations observed during winter (33.3 ± 22.2 μg m−3). Chemical analysis revealed distinct contributions of organic aerosols (OA), nitrate (NO3−), sulfate (SO42−), ammonium (NH4+), and chloride (Cl−) to NR-PM1. Organic aerosol consistently contained the most significant fraction of NR-PM1 (49–67 % seasonally). Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) resolved four distinct OA sources: traffic-related hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), biomass-burning OA (BBOA), and two oxygenated OA factors (Semi-Volatile Oxygenated OA (SVOOA) and Low-Volatile Oxygenated OA (LV-OOA)). Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) was a large OA fraction, with LVOOA being most abundant in winter and post-monsoon, while SV-OOA was higher in monsoon and summer, suggesting photochemical and potentially aqueous-phase formation. Seasonal changes were also observed in OA elemental composition (O/C: 0.67–0.74; H/C: 1.53–1.61; OM/OC: 2.07–2.16) and carbon oxidation state (OSc: 0.25 in monsoon/winter to −0.06 in summer), further supporting the influence of photochemical processes. Size distribution analysis indicated that aerosols were predominantly in the accumulation mode (300–800 nm), suggesting aged and internally mixed aerosol particles. Back trajectory and Concentration Weighted Trajectory (CWT) analyses indicated varied regional influences on PM1 source characteristics."

10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108078,True,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文探讨了非洲西部亚热带海洋层积云的月度变化如何受到大气气溶胶和热力学变量的影响。论文利用卫星和再分析数据，研究了撒哈拉沙尘气溶胶和生物质燃烧气溶胶对云层覆盖的影响，特别是在加那利群岛和纳米比亚附近的海洋层积云区域。研究结果表明，沙尘气溶胶比传统的热力学预测因子更能解释加那利群岛区域的低云覆盖，而生物质燃烧气溶胶的影响相对较小。虽然论文没有直接涉及特定的空气质量监测技术，但它对气溶胶（空气质量的重要组成部分）与云层相互作用的分析，以及对卫星数据的应用，使其与大气环境遥感技术领域密切相关。,"['aerosols', 'marine stratocumulus clouds', 'satellite data', 'cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)', 'aerosol optical depth', 'air quality']",Waren Dale Soriano;Tra Dinh;Gilles Bellon,Effects of the estimated inversion strength and aerosols on monthly variations of subtropical marine stratocumulus to the west of Africa,"•The estimated inversion strength (EIS) isa poor predictor of marine low-cloud cover (LCC) near the Canary Islands. •Dust aerosols explain the LCC maximum in the Canary LCC region better than EIS and other known thermodynamic predictors of LCC. •The effect of aerosols on LCC as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) is physically independent from EIS. •Biomass-burning aerosols are less effective as CCN and have a smaller effect on the monthly variations of LCC. 
 Satellite and reanalysis data over the 2003–2022 period are used to study how the monthly variations of marine stratocumulus (MSc) to the west of Canary Islands and Namibia are influenced by thermodynamic variables and aerosols. Although the estimated inversion strength (EIS) has been thought to be the main predictor of low-cloud cover (LCC), the seasonal cycles of EIS and LCC differ significantly in the Canary MSc region. In linear regression models, adding dust aerosol (DA) optical depth as a predictor improves the prediction of LCC across all seasons and almost everywhere in the region compared to using EIS alone. In boreal summer, large amount of DAs are transported from the Sahara to the Canary MSc region. Analysis of the regression models shows that DAs contribute more than EIS to the Canary summer LCC maximum, reducing the error by up to 11 %. Biomass-burning aerosols (BBAs) also improve the prediction of LCC in the Canary MSc region, but less so than DAs, suggesting that BBAs are less effective as cloud condensation nucleii. Other known thermodynamic predictors of LCC (sea surface temperature, horizontal surface temperature advection, near-surface wind speed, and free-tropospheric relative humidity and vertical velocity) also improve the prediction, but much less effectively than the aerosols. In the Namibia MSc region, there are virtually no DAs but BBAs are abundant. There, EIS alone captures well the seasonal cycle of LCC. In this region, the effect of BBAs on LCC is hidden behind that of EIS, potentially because BBA optical depth and EIS coincidentally have similar seasonal cycles."
