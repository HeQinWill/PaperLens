10.5194/acp-25-15785-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注欧洲地区超细颗粒物（PM0.1）的浓度和化学成分的季节性和空间变化模拟。虽然涉及空气质量，但侧重于地面模型模拟和化学成分分析，而非大气环境遥感技术，如卫星观测或遥感数据分析。因此，与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强。,"['ultrafine particulate matter', 'PM0.1', 'PM2.5', 'chemical composition', 'air quality modeling']",Konstantinos Mataras;Evangelia Siouti;David Patoulias;Spyros N. Pandis,Simulation of the seasonal and spatial variability of the concentrations and chemical composition of ultrafine particulate matter over Europe,"Predicted levels of ultrafine particle mass (PM0.1) vary substantially over Europe with higher values in the summer than in the winter. In summer, PM0.1 was mostly comprised of sulfate (38 %) and secondary organics (32 %). During winter the sulfate fraction increased to 47 % and primary organics contributed 23 %. Correlations between PM0.1 and the regulated PM2.5 were low. This suggests that there are significant differences between the dominant sources and processes of PM0.1 and PM2.5. 
 Ultrafine particles (UFPs) have attracted interest as perhaps the most dangerous fraction of atmospheric PM. This study focuses on the ultrafine particulate matter (PM0.1) mass concentrations and their chemical composition during a summer and winter period in Europe.Predicted levels of PM0.1 varied substantially, both in space and in time. The average predicted PM0.1 mass concentration was 0.6 µg m−3 in the summer, higher than the 0.3 µg m−3 predicted in the winter period. PM0.1 chemical composition exhibited significant seasonality. In summer, PM0.1 was mostly comprised of secondary inorganic matter (38 % sulfate and 13 % ammonium) and organics (9 % primary and 32 % secondary). During the winter, the fraction of secondary inorganic matter increased, with sulfate contributing 47 % and ammonium 19 %, on average. Primary organic matter contribution also increased from 9 % in summer to 23 % in winter, while secondary organic matter decreased significantly to 6 % on average during winter.During summertime, the model performance at 12 sites for daily average ultrafine particle volume (PV0.1) concentrations was considered good, with normalized mean error (NME) equal to 46 % and normalized mean bias (NMB) equal to 15 %. For the winter period, the corresponding values for daily average levels were −27 % for NMB and 64 % for NME, indicating an average model performance.Correlations between PM0.1 and the currently regulated PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter less than or equal to 2.5 µm) were generally low. Better correlations were observed in cases where the primary component of PM0.1 was significant. This suggests that there are significant differences between the dominant sources and processes of PM0.1 and PM2.5."

 Tropospheric ozone (O3) is a harmful secondary atmospheric pollutant and an important greenhouse gas. Multiple satellite records have shown conflicting long-term O3 trends across regions of the globe, including Europe. Here, we investigate lower-tropospheric sub-column O3 (LTCO3, surface – 450 hPa) records from three ultraviolet (UV) sounders produced by the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL): the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME, 1996–2010), the Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY, 2003–2011) and the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI, 2005–2017). GOME and SCIAMACHY detect negative trends of approximately −0.2 DU yr−1, while OMI indicates a negligible trend. The TOMCAT 3-D chemical transport model was used to investigate processes driving simulated trends and to identify possible reasons for satellite trend discrepancies. The simulated LTCO3 trends were negligible (consistent with ozonesonde trends), even when spatiotemporally co-located to the satellite level-2 swath data and convolved by averaging kernels (i.e. a measure of the satellite retrieval vertical sensitivity). Model sensitivity experiments with the emissions or meteorology fixed to 2008 also showed negligible LTCO3 trends between 1996 and 2018, indicating that changes in emissions and meteorology had a limited impact on LTCO3 temporal evolution. Given the substantial decrease in air pollutant emissions, this was unexpected, while year-to-year variability dominated the meteorological influence on LTCO3. Finally, we find a negligible trend in the long-term stratosphere O3 flux into the free troposphere over this period arriving over Europe. Overall, our observational and modelling analysis indicates that European LTCO3 trends have been stable between 1996 and 2018."
10.5194/acp-25-15969-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文对比了六个全球地面臭氧数据集，这些数据集使用地统计学、机器学习或化学再分析方法开发。研究发现这些数据集在臭氧浓度和趋势上存在显著差异，并通过与观测数据对比，评估了它们的性能。虽然该研究没有直接涉及卫星观测或特定的遥感技术，但它与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它关注地面臭氧这一重要的大气成分，并评估了不同估算方法（包括可能使用遥感数据进行校准或验证的方法）的准确性。研究结果对于利用遥感数据进行空气质量监测和大气成分分析，以及评估臭氧对健康的影响具有重要意义。该研究揭示了不同臭氧数据集之间的差异，强调了提高全球臭氧分布估算准确性的必要性，这对于遥感技术的应用和发展至关重要。,"['ground-level ozone', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'health impacts', 'chemical reanalysis', 'geostatistical methods', 'machine learning']",Hantao Wang;Kazuyuki Miyazaki;Haitong Zhe Sun;Zhen Qu;Xiang Liu;Antje Inness;Martin Schultz;Sabine Schröder;Marc Serre;J. Jason West,Intercomparison of global ground-level ozone datasets for health-relevant metrics,"We compare six datasets of global ground-level ozone, developed using geostatistical, machine learning, or reanalysis methods. The datasets show important differences from one another in ozone magnitude, greater than 5 ppb, and trends, globally and regionally. Compared with measurements, performance varies among datasets, and most overestimate ozone, particularly at lower concentrations. These differences among datasets highlight uncertainties for applications to health and other impacts. 
 Ground-level ozone is a significant air pollutant that detrimentally affects human health and agriculture. Global ground-level ozone concentrations have been estimated using chemical reanalyses, geostatistical methods, and machine learning, but these datasets have not been compared systematically. We compare six global ground-level ozone datasets (three chemical reanalyses, two machine learning, one geostatistics) relative to observations and against one another, for the ozone season daily maximum 8 h average mixing ratio, for 2006 to 2016. Comparing with global ground-level observations, most datasets overestimate ozone, particularly at lower observed concentrations. In 2016, across all stations, grid-to-grid R2 ranges from 0.50 to 0.75 and RMSE 4.25 to 12.22 ppb. Agreement with observed distributions is reduced at ozone concentrations above 50 ppb. Results show significant differences among datasets in global average ozone, as large as 5–10 ppb, multi-year trends, and regional distributions. For example, in Europe, the two chemical reanalyses show an increasing trend while other datasets show no increase. Among the six datasets, the share of population exposed to over 50 ppb varies from 61 % [28 %, 94 %] to 99 % [62 %, 100 %] in East Asia, 17 % [4 %, 72 %] to 88 % [53 %, 99 %] in North America, and 9 % [0 %, 58 %] to 76 % [22 %, 96 %] in Europe (2006–2016 average). Although sharing some of the same input data, we found important differences, likely from variations in approaches, resolution, and other input data, highlighting the importance of continued research on global ozone distributions. These discrepancies are large enough to impact assessments of health impacts and other applications."
10.5194/acp-25-16009-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了2000年至2021年期间欧洲和美国城市地区的臭氧变化趋势。它使用了地表监测站的数据，分析了臭氧浓度随时间的变化，并识别出不同区域的趋势模式。虽然该研究没有直接提及遥感技术或卫星观测，但它使用了地表监测数据来评估大气成分（即臭氧）的变化，这与大气环境遥感技术在空气质量监测方面的应用密切相关。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术有很强的关联性。,"['ozone', 'air quality monitoring', 'surface monitoring', 'atmospheric composition']",Beth S. Nelson;Will S. Drysdale,Urban ozone trends in Europe and the USA (2000–2021),"Urban O3 trends across Europe and the USA were explored between 2000–2021. Most warm season trends in high O3 in Europe were shown to be decreasing, though low values in both warm and cold seasons were increasing. Trends in the USA were similar, but showed less increasing trends low O3 in the warm season. Sites with similar trends were grouped, more different were seen in the USA, and identified ones where trends in high O3 values had started to increase later in the period. 
 Trends in urban maximum daily 8 h average ozone concentrations, alongside annual ozone episodic and exposure metrics, across Europe and the United States of America were explored between 2000–2021. Using surface monitoring site data from the TOAR-II and European Environment Agency databases, piecewise quantile regression (PQR) analysis was performed on 353 time series (204 European, 149 USA). The PQR analysis permitted 2 break points over the period to balance the intent to describe changes over a large time period, while still capturing the abrupt changes that can occur in urban atmospheres. We found that there were many sites across Europe with high certainty increasing trends in the 5th and 50th quantiles, whereas the majority of high certainty trends in the 95th quantile were found to be decreasing. A similar pattern was observed across the USA, with 5th quantile trends increasing and 95th quantile trends decreasing, though a small but increasing number of sites showed a return to increasing trend at τ = 95. To group trends, hierarchical clustering with dynamic time warping was employed and these groups used to guide analysis. Clustering was typically regional across Europe and the USA, and increasing trends were identified across southern and the central alpine regions of Europe, and in California and the Intermountain West of the USA. Recent high certainty increasing trends in the Intermountain West may be related to warmer summers and increased wildfire events in the region, highlighting the need to monitor changing ozone trends with climate change, to assess human exposure risk to elevated levels of ozone."

Using simulations with high resolution, we found that fire heat and moisture help form these clouds, lifting particles high into the atmosphere. This process is crucial for understanding how fires affect the environment. Despite some differences from observational data, our findings match well over time, showing the importance of fire-induced heat in cloud formation. 
 Understanding pyro-convective clouds is essential. These clouds transport significant quantities of aerosols and gases into the upper atmosphere and therefore influence atmospheric composition, weather, and climate on a global scale. This study investigates the dynamics of pyro-convective clouds during the Australian New Years Event 2019/2020 using convection-resolving simulations that incorporate the effects of sensible heat and moisture released by fires. These effects are modeled through parameterizations using retrievals from the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS). The results show that the plume top height remains unchanged when accounting for fire-induced heat and moisture release in regions where convective cells form independently of the fire. In areas with the most intense fires, the sensible heat and moisture release from the fire provide the necessary buoyancy for enabling the formation of pyro-convective clouds. Pyro-convective clouds lift aerosol masses up to altitudes of 12.0 km. During their formation, the plume top height more than doubles, compared with a reference simulation in which such clouds do not develop. Additionally, the plume height increase is, on average, just 0.87 km by fire-induced heat and moisture in cloud-free areas. We demonstrated that sensible heat release is the primary contributor to pyro-convective cloud formation. However, the release of moisture enhances the formation process and increases the lifetime of the pyro-convective cloud. Comparisons with observational data show that the plume's distribution and height are underestimated. However, the simulations align well with observations after a 5–6 h delay, indicating that pyro-convective cells are accurately modeled but occur later in the model than are actually observed."

Satellite data, surface measurements and air mass modeling tracked the smoke from fires in Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay, transported to São Paulo within 2 d. The smoke–cloud interaction reduced surface irradiance to zero for 40 min and increased radiative efficiency by 7 %, highlighting impacts on air quality and radiation budget. 
 Biomass burning is a worldwide practice applied to deforestation that can have disastrous consequences for local and regional environments. This paper describes a case study of an extreme event of biomass burning smoke transport toward the São Paulo metropolitan area (MASP), on 19 August 2019, when the city experienced an uncommon completely dark sky around 15:00 UTC−3. A synergy between air mass back trajectories, satellite-retrieved aerosol fields and surface radiometric measurements was used to find the origin of the smoke plume affecting the city and to analyse the radiative impact of the transport of the smoke toward the city. Results showed that the MASP atmosphere was affected by the transport of a dense smoke plume with aerosol optical depth at 550 nm above 1. Air mass back trajectories and auxiliary data indicated that most of the smoke was emitted 2 d before arrival. The smoke plume in combination with clouds, associated with a frontal system, produced a strong radiative impact, as observed by a regional network of pyranometers. During the day of darkness, the diurnal clearness index was below 0.1 in all five MASP stations, and a maximum of the cloud optical depth higher than 300 was retrieved, producing irradiances at surface that dropped to 0 for approximately 40 min. The strong radiative efficiency (cloud radiative effect per cloud optical depth unit) of this extreme event was 7 % higher than other overcast days observed in a 2-year period."

Pfannerstill;Jonathan Williams,Seasonal isoprene emission estimates over tropical South America inferred from satellite observations of isoprene,"Isoprene released by plants can impact atmospheric chemistry and climate. The Amazon rainforest is a major source of isoprene. We derived isoprene emissions using satellite retrievals of isoprene columns and a chemical transport model. We evaluated our isoprene emission estimates using ground-based isoprene observations and satellite retrievals of formaldehyde. We found that using satellite retrievals of isoprene can help us better understand isoprene emissions over the Amazon. 
 Isoprene, a volatile organic compound (VOC) emitted by plants, plays a significant role in atmospheric chemistry and climate. The Amazon rainforest is a globally relevant source of atmospheric isoprene. We report isoprene emissions inferred from a full-physics retrieval of isoprene columns from the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) and the local sensitivities between isoprene emissions and isoprene columns determined by the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model. Compared with the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) isoprene emissions, the isoprene emission estimates inferred from CrIS have  different spatial and seasonal distributions with generally lower emission rates but higher emission rates over the northern Amazon basin and southeast Brazil. The observed mean isoprene concentration at the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO), March–December 2019, is 3.0 ± 2.2 ppbv, which is reproduced better by the GEOS-Chem model driven by isoprene emissions inferred from CrIS (2.8 ± 1.4 ppbv) than by the MEGAN inventory (4.1 ± 1.3 ppbv). Isoprene emission estimates inferred from CrIS generally agree better than MEGAN with in situ observations of seasonal isoprene fluxes over the Amazon. GEOS-Chem model formaldehyde (HCHO) columns, corresponding to isoprene emissions inferred from CrIS, are generally more consistent with TROPOMI data (normalized mean error, NME = 43 %) than the HCHO columns corresponding to MEGAN isoprene emissions (NME = 50 %), as expected. CrIS-inferred isoprene emission rates can vary by ±20 % considering potential model biases in nitrogen oxide emissions. Our results provide confidence that we can use CrIS data to examine future impacts of anthropogenic activities on isoprene emissions from the Amazon."

Chipperfield;Chris Wilson;Wuhu Feng,Global optimal estimation retrievals of  atmospheric carbonyl sulfide over water  from IASI measurement spectra for 2018,"We use satellite measurements to estimate quantities of a gas called carbonyl sulfide (OCS) in the atmosphere. OCS is consumed during photosynthesis, much like carbon dioxide (CO2). Our data is focused mostly over the global oceans for the year 2018, and we find it compares well with past satellite observations, ground-based measurements and modelled OCS. We hope to extend this measurement record and use it in data-driven tools in the future to better understand the carbon cycle globally. 
 Carbonyl sulfide (OCS) is consumed by vegetation during photosynthesis in a one-way hydrolysis reaction, making measuring OCS vegetative uptake a means of inferring and quantifying global gross primary production. Recent studies highlight that uncertainties in OCS surface fluxes remain high and OCS datasets with better spatial coverage are required, particularly from satellite. Here OCS profiles are retrieved using measured radiances from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) instruments. We estimate total column amounts over oceanic and inland water regions for the example year 2018, using an optimal estimation scheme, using the University of Leicester IASI retrieval scheme (ULIRS) for selected microwindows in the 2000–2100 cm−1 wavenumber range. Information content exceeds one between ±50° latitude and a peak in vertical sensitivity around 6–10 km (500–300 hPa) in the troposphere. Diurnal variations are limited to ±2 %, showing larger total column amounts at the daytime overpass. The IASI OCS observations show a correlation of at least 0.74 at half the ground-based flask measurement sites compared. Results also agree with the University of Leeds TOMCAT 3-D chemical transport model simulations within ±5 % throughout most tropical regions. This study demonstrates the ability of the IASI instrument to detect OCS in the troposphere and observe a reasonable seasonal cycle indicative of being driven by photosynthesis. Further data acquisition is recommended to gain insight into inter-annual variability in OCS. This novel work will also help improve our understanding of the role of vegetation in the carbon cycle, particularly when utilised in inversion methods."

To reduce the uncertainty in quantifying present-day climate change, we combine two satellite sensors and a model to assess the aerosol effects on radiation in all-sky conditions. Satellite-based and coincident aircraft measurements of aerosol radiative effects agree well over the southeast Atlantic. This constitutes a crucial first evaluation before we apply our method to more years and more regions of the world. 
 The improvement of satellite-derived calculations of direct aerosol radiative effects (DARE) is essential for reducing the uncertainty in the impact of aerosol on solar radiation. We develop a framework to compute DARE at the top of the Earth's atmosphere, in the shortwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and in all-sky conditions along the track of the A-Train constellation of satellites. We use combined state-of-the-art aerosol and cloud properties from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensors. We also use a global reanalysis from the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) to provide vertical distribution of aerosol properties and atmospheric conditions. Diurnal mean satellite DARE values range from −25 W m−2 (cooling) to 40 W m−2 (warming) over the southeast Atlantic during 3 days from the NASA ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS (ORACLES) aircraft campaign. These 3 days indicate agreement between our satellite-calculated DARE and co-located airborne Solar Spectral Flux Radiometer (SSFR) measurements. This paper constitutes the first step before applying our algorithm to more years of combined satellite and model data over more regions of the world. The goal is to ultimately assess the order of importance of atmospheric parameters in the calculation of DARE for specific aerosol and cloud regimes. This will inform future missions about where, when, and how accurately the retrievals should be performed to reduce all-sky DARE uncertainties."

Results show PM is dominated by organic aerosol (73 %), black carbon (16 %), and inorganics (11 %), with BC largely from fossil fuel (59 %) and biomass burning (41 %). Findings highlight the impact of solid fuels and aging vehicles and stress the need for regional mitigation strategies to reduce air pollution-related health risks. 
 Ambient air pollution poses a significant threat to public health, particularly in low and middle-income countries, where detailed data on particulate matter (PM) mass and composition are scarce. We conducted a year-long study on PM composition and sources in Eastern Africa (Kigali, Rwanda). The annual mean concentration of PM1 was 31±15µgm-3 , with slightly higher concentrations during the dry season. Organic aerosols (OA) contributed 73 % of the observed PM1 mass, black carbon (BC) 16 %, nitrate 6 %, sulfate and ammonium 2 % each, and chlorine 1 %. BC is approximately 60 % due to fossil fuel emissions and 40 % from biomass burning emissions. Tracer ions detected by the aerosol mass spectrometer suggest that photochemistry plays a significant role in the formation of secondary OA during the daytime (06:00 a.m.–06:00 p.m.), while primary OA dominates in the morning and evening due to increased anthropogenic activity and shallower boundary layer height. PM1 OA in Kigali is primarily composed of Oxygenated Organic Aerosols (OOA, 45 %), Hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA, 32 %), and Biomass Burning OA (BBOA, 23 %). Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) accounted for 47 % and 41 % of PM1 OA during the rainy and dry seasons, while primary OA (POA: BBOA + HOA) contributed 53 % and 59 %. Short-term interventions that limit traffic activity on some Saturdays and Sundays had a mixed impact on ambient PM1 and PM2.5 concentrations, with car-free Sundays reducing PM1 concentrations throughout most of the day."

Here we show, using observations and model experiments, that aerosols also intensify rainfall variability on two- to four-week timescales over South China primarily through cloud-microphysical processes, while radiative effects play a secondary role, thereby amplifying prolonged heavy rainfall events. 
 Persistent heavy rainfall events over densely populated South China are closely linked to the intensification of quasi-biweekly (8–30 d) oscillations. This study examines whether and how aerosols influence quasi-biweekly oscillations using observational analyses and model experiments. Statistical analysis reveals a significant phase-leading relationship between increased aerosol loadings, quantified by aerosol optical depth, and subsequent enhancement of 8–30 d rainfall anomalies. At the 8–30 d timescale, aerosols primarily influence rainfall intensity through cloud microphysical processes, with radiative effects playing a secondary role. Approximately four days before enhanced rainfall events, positive aerosol anomalies contribute to increased low-level cloud water content, leading to condensational latent heat release. This low-level latent heating strengthens low-level moisture convergence and ascending motion, which uplifts cloud droplets above the freezing level. Subsequently, additional latent heat release from mixed-phase processes (freezing/deposition) further intensifies vertical motion, amplifying precipitation anomalies. Once deep convection develops, clouds absorb longwave radiation, sustaining precipitation intensification. Sensitivity experiments using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) confirm these mechanisms, demonstrating that anthropogenic aerosol enhancement intensifies precipitation anomalies through both aerosol-cloud microphysical interactions and longwave cloud-radiative effects, with the former being more dominant. Quantitatively, aerosol-induced latent heating exceeds aerosol-induced longwave radiative heating by a factor of ∼ 4–7 in both observations and model simulations. These findings highlight the need to improve aerosol-cloud microphysical parameterizations in operational models to enhance the accuracy of extended-range heavy rainfall predictions in South China."

This study examined the complex diurnal aging cycles on biomass burning aerosol composition and oxidative potential, a key toxicity metric. Additional organic aerosol (OA) mass was produced after the two (day/night and night/day) cycles, varying from 35 to 90 % of the initial OA.

 Residential biomass burning is an important wintertime source of aerosols. These particles are subjected to complex diurnal aging processes in the atmosphere, contributing to urban and regional air pollution. The cumulative impact of these aging cycles on aerosol composition and oxidative potential, a key toxicity metric, remains unclear. This study examined the oxidation cycles of biomass burning emissions during day-to-night and night-to-day transitions in the FORTH (Foundation for Research and Technology – Hellas) atmospheric simulation chamber, focusing on emissions from burning of olive wood. The final high-resolution AMS spectra of biomass burning organic aerosol (bbOA) after either oxidation cycle were almost identical (R2 > 0.99, θ= 3°). This indicates transformation into similar biomass burning secondary organic aerosol (bbSOA) regardless of the initial step of the diurnal cycle. A 56 % average increase in the bbOA oxygen-to-carbon (O:C) ratio was observed during both cycle cases (from 0.38 ± 0.06 for the fresh to 0.59 ± 0.07 after aging). Additional OA mass was produced after the two cycles, varying from 35 % to 90 % of the initial OA. The aging of the emissions led to a final water-soluble oxidative potential (WS-OP) increase of 60 % to 68 ± 18 pmol min−1 µg−1 for both cycles, but with notably different transient values that depend on the order of the oxidation regimes. The effect of each oxidation regime on the WS-OP of the bbOA depends on the airmass history. The evolution of the WS-OP was not well correlated with that of the O:C."

These measurements revealed missing reaction pathways in current chemical mechanisms. Our findings help improve predictions of air quality and deepen understanding of chemical processes in the atmosphere. 
 Bicyclic peroxy radicals (BPRs) from aromatics hydrocarbons oxidation play increasingly recognized roles in the formation of secondary air pollutants. However, their reaction mechanisms remain poorly constrained, largely due to the lack of direct measurement techniques. In this study, we developed a method for quantitative measurement of BPRs using an iodide chemical ionization mass spectrometer (Vocus AIM). Following instrument optimization, the sensitivity for BPRs reached 0.3–0.6 ncps pptv−1, with a detection limit of ∼ 1 pptv and an uncertainty of ∼ 41 %. Our flow reactor experiments revealed that the bicyclic pathway dominates the OH-initiated oxidation of aromatics under low-NOx conditions, accounting for 57.0 % and 69.5 % of the oxidation products of toluene and m-xylene, respectively. Comparative analysis further demonstrated that conventional product-yield-based approaches underestimate the branching ratio of the bicyclic pathway by 4 %–9 % relative to direct BPR quantification. This discrepancy suggests the presence of unaccounted reaction channels in current chemical mechanisms, even when autoxidation and accretion reactions are considered. By directly quantifying BPRs, this study provides new insights into the atmospheric oxidation of aromatics and highlights the need for further mechanistic investigation. Moreover, the reaction-pathway-controlled quantification approach proposed here effectively reduces the challenges associated with measuring functionalized RO2 radicals and demonstrates strong potential for sensitive, speciated RO2 detection using Vocus AIM in both laboratory and ambient environments."

Using quantum-chemical calculations and photochemical box model simulation with an updated Master Chemical Mechanism, we found that the formation pathway of acetic acid from the 2-butene + OH reaction involves NO-mediated multi-generation oxidation processes. Our findings enhance the understanding of organic acid formation and highlight the pivotal role of NO in polluted urban atmospheres. 
 Alkenes are primary pollutants in petrochemical source atmospheres, and their atmospheric chemistry is of great importance for tropospheric ozone and secondary organic aerosol formation. Hence, combining quantum chemical calculations and kinetic modelling, we investigated the oxidation mechanism and kinetics of 2-butene (BU), as one of the most important alkenes, and its impact on the environment. The mechanism results show that OH addition is the dominant pathway for cis- and trans-isomers of BU, and then the corresponding OH-adducts are attacked by O2 to produce peroxy radicals, which further react with NO to form acetaldehyde and hydroxyalkyl radicals. Different from the one adopted in current atmospheric models, addition of hydroxyalkyl radicals by O2 and NO to form acetic acid proceeds with a smaller barrier than that for H-abstraction by O2 to form acetaldehyde. A lifetime of less than a few hours (<4 h) for BU is estimated in the petrochemical regions. Kinetic modelling demonstrates that oxidation of BU is predicted to yield significant amounts of organic acids (>56 %) in the petrochemical areas, larger than those are currently recognized, even in environments with low NO concentrations. Our results reveal that the OH-initiated oxidation of BU contributes importantly to organic acid budgets, particularly in the petrochemical regions, bridging the gap in organic acid budgets."

Our study shows that the presence of surfactants alters the spreading coefficients of the organic and inorganic phases. Therefore, the phase-separated particle morphology can shift from the conventional core-shell structure to partial engulfing configurations, or even to inverse core-shell forms where the organic phase is surrounded by an outer inorganic shell. 
 The mixing state of atmospheric aerosols undergoing liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is crucial for regulating atmospheric chemistry and influencing global climate, often adding uncertainties to atmospheric and climate models. Despite its significance, understanding how coexisting species, such as surfactants, affect the mixing state of phase-separated aerosols remains limited. This study investigated the phase transition behaviors and resulting mixing states of aerosols composed of 1,2,6-hexanetriol and ammonium sulfate, with added surfactants. Contrary to the commonly assumed core-shell structure, we observed that at very low concentration of hydrocarbon surfactants, the organic phase partially engulfed the aqueous inorganic phase, a configuration we termed partial organic-phase engulfing. Furthermore, we discovered the formation of partial inorganic-phase engulfing and inverse core-shell structures, where the inorganic phase partially or fully spread over the organic domain at higher surfactant levels. We identified a relationship between equilibrium particle morphology and spreading coefficients, primarily governed by surface tension reduction in the separated organic and inorganic phases. These distinctive mixing states may substantially alter the chemical, physical, and optical properties of organic-inorganic aerosols under real atmospheric conditions. Our findings bridge a critical knowledge gap regarding the role of surface tension evolution in the equilibrium particle morphology of internally mixed atmospheric particles and its potential impact on aerosol-chemistry-climate interactions. These insights emphasize the need to refine current aerosol models to incorporate the specific LLPS morphologies observed in this study."

The reconstructed fields can be used to monitor ARs. It studies what low-Earth orbit (LEO) radio occultation (RO) constellation is appropriate to quantify the structure, location and timing of ARs. 
 Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are long filaments that transport large amounts of water vapor from the Tropics to mid- and high latitudes. They are directly related to heavy precipitation and extreme weather leading to flooding and mud slides. Accurate identification of AR structures over the ocean is important to improve the forecast of their landfall location and timing. Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) is a space-based technique that can measure meteorological variables with high vertical resolution. While RO can observe structures like ARs in individual RO profiles, RO observations have non-uniform and sparse spatial and temporal sampling, so it is not yet possible to fully characterize AR morphology using RO alone.In this work, we use previous research in which we applied machine learning (ML) to enhance the spatial and temporal resolution of RO observations. Here, we train neural networks (NNs) to map RO observations and help resolve ARs. Analyses using existing RO data, such as from the COSMIC-2 mission, showed that the sampling density is insufficient to resolve and geo-locate ARs. Adding observations from the other available missions (for example METOP) improved matters, but was still insufficient to reliably reconstruct AR structure.We undertake a study to determine how many LEO RO satellites would be needed to quantify the structure, location, and timing of ARs. We simulate RO observations as would be obtained with Walker constellations of 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 LEO RO satellites. First, we investigate possible constellations for proper AR monitoring. We aim for constellations that lead to hourly RO counts that change as little as possible during the AR (up to several days). This allows us to resolve ARs with similar accuracy during the scenario. We conclude that 3 or 6 orbital planes and inclinations between 85 and 90° perform best. Second, we make use of 12 h forecasts of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) system to interpolate the forecasts to the simulated RO constellation sampling coordinates. Third, we use the ECMWF-based RO observations to train ML models and map them to the ECMWF grid. We compare ML-mapped RO sampled grids to ECMWF products in a closed-loop validation. Initially, we map RO refractivity at 2 km geopotential height, where small-scale structures related to water vapor are visible. We find that at least 36 RO satellites are needed to characterize the morphology of ARs in the Pacific basin with useful precision and accuracy (from the ML produced maps). Then, we use a framework with two consecutive NNs to map column-integrated water vapor (IWV) from profiles of RO. The first NN maps the refractivity into IWV, and the second NN maps the IWV spatially. In this case, we find that a constellation of 48 satellites is needed to continuously map IWV fields accurately and thus reconstruct the morphology of ARs with useful precision and accuracy. Finally, when using RO, we find that mapping refractivity into IWV is less accurate over land than over oceans. To further improve the AR mapping over land, we made use of IWV from ground-based (GB) GNSS. The significantly higher spatial and temporal resolutions of GB data compared to RO lead to much improved IWV fields and thus AR path and shape over land."

This result enables continuous aerosol monitoring and highlights microwave radiometry's under-utilized potential in atmospheric research. 
 Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a crucial parameter for understanding the impact of aerosols on Earth's atmosphere and air quality. Nevertheless, most existing remote sensing techniques rely on the shortwave spectrum, precluding nighttime measurements. While lunar and stellar photometry can measure nighttime AOD, their data availability is limited due to the scarce moonlight for lunar photometry and the rarity of application for stellar photometry. In this study, we made a first attempt to retrieve AOD from ground-based microwave radiometer (MWR) measurements in Beijing Nanjiao Meteorological Observatory in China. Brightness temperatures (BTs) at the K-band (from 22.23  to 30.00 GHz) and V-band (from 51.25 to 58.80 GHz) are trained against daytime spectral AOD from sun photometer measurements together with the temperature profile using the random forest regression (RFR) retrieval model, and the model is then used to retrieve nighttime AOD. The algorithm demonstrates satisfactory performance, with reasonable agreement with lunar AOD retrievals from the lunar photometer (R=0.91 and RMSE =0.14). The results also reveal a distinct day–night cycle of AOD, with nighttime AOD typically higher than its daytime value for the Beijing-CAMS Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) site and AOD estimated based on MWR measurements. The physical basis of our approach is verified using vertical temperature and humidity profiles from sounding observation and simulation results from WRF-Chem as well as the monochromatic radiative transfer model (MonoRTM). Our study provides an effective and convenient approach to estimate nighttime aerosol loading from surface, which has great potential in environmental monitoring and climate forcing research."

It can also be measured (from ground or space) by radar and lidar. We compare satellite data we developed using the oxygen method with other estimates to help us refine our technique. 
 We previously developed the Cloud Height Retrieval from O2 Molecular Absorption (CHROMA) algorithm for the Ocean Color Instrument (OCI) on the new NASA Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission. Here, we apply CHROMA to observations from the Ocean Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) to guide expectations for PACE, as it will take some time to obtain large-scale validation data for OCI. We use cloud top height (CTH), phase, and (for liquid clouds) cloud optical thickness (COT) data from the ground-based Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) network to evaluate the OLCI retrievals. We found that OLCI and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) CTH compare similarly well to the ARM reference. OLCI has a tendency to underestimate CTH as CTH increases, and algorithm assumptions about cloud geometric thickness may contribute to this. ARM COT from multifilter shadowband radiometers (MFRSR) and Sun photometers are well-correlated with one another, albeit with a roughly 30 % offset on average; OLCI and MODIS COT agree more closely with the MFRSR data. OLCI retrieval uncertainty estimates show skill at telling low-uncertainty cases from high-uncertainty ones, although CTH uncertainties are underestimated. Additionally, we compare the OLCI data to satellite retrievals based on thermal infrared measurements from MODIS and  Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) data. Differences are broadly consistent with physical expectations based on the A-band vs.  thermal techniques, although one key challenge in such aggregated comparisons is different cloud masking sensitivities and algorithm failure rates meaning additional sampling differences are introduced. We conclude by discussing the transition to and possible enhancements for PACE OCI."

We evaluate measurements of five furanoids under laboratory conditions. Sensitivities were stable across humidity and electric field changes, though some compounds fragmented or formed hydrated ions. Long-term gas standard concentrations were stable. Overall, measurements are accurate but affected by unknown ions and fragments. 
 Furanoids are significant contributors to volatile organic compound hydroxyl radical reactivity in biomass burning emissions, yet their accurate measurement using proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) remains challenging due to potential interferences and measurement uncertainties. In this study, we conduct detailed laboratory characterizations of furan (C4H4O, protonated m/z 69.033), 2(3H)-furanone (C4H4O2, m/z 85.028), 2-furaldehyde (C5H4O2, m/z 97.028), 2,5-dimethylfuran (C6H8O, m/z 97.065), and maleic anhydride (C4H2O3, m/z 99.008). Sensitivities for these compounds were found to have minimal dependence (less than 15 %) on both sample humidity and drift tube electric field strength (E/N). At high E/N (150 Td), fragmentation was observed for 2-furaldehyde (∼ 8 %) at m/z 69.033, potentially interfering furan measurements, while hydrolysis products corresponding to m/z+18 ions were detected for 2(3H)-furanone, 2-furaldehyde, and maleic anhydride. The hydrolysis of maleic anhydride to maleic acid is most prominent, with the hydrate accounting for 7 %–31 % of the parent ion signal across E/N conditions.Gas standard recertification confirmed the long-term stability of furanoids, and 21 other VOCs, in compressed gas mixtures, with changes in mixing ratios of less than 5 % over seven years, although PTR-ToF-MS instrument sensitivities decreased by ∼ 30 % during this time, likely due to aging of the microchannel plate (MCP). While the stability of gas standards and the minimal humidity and fragmentation effects support the accurate measurement of furanoids by PTR-ToF-MS, discrepancies with co-deployed gas chromatography-mass spectrometry highlight the need to further investigate potential isomeric and fragment interferences, particularly in aged BB smoke."

 The 2023 Canadian wildfires yielded record-breaking emissions that were transported long distances over large sections of the mid-Atlantic region, significantly impacting regional surface air quality. In this study, we analyzed the effect of long-distance transported wildfire smoke on the Baltimore-Washington Corridor (BWC), a highly populated and industrialized metropolitan region prone to air quality exceedances. Central to the analysis is the Vaisala CL61 ceilometer in Beltsville (suburban BWC), whose linear depolarization ratio (LDR) profiles provide a continuous, altitude-resolved fingerprint for distinguishing wildfire smoke from locally generated urban aerosols. By combining the LDR-derived with satellite imagery, surface air quality observations, and NOAA HYSPLIT trajectories, we analyzed four discrete smoke events to characterize smoke's vertical distribution and interaction with the planetary boundary layer (PBL). One of the cases showed that the timing of the smoke plume's apparent lowering over the study site in relation to synoptic frontal passage was decisive in determining its impact on air quality. In contrast, those events with well-mixed smoke in the PBL during the advection-driven conditions exhibited a clear deterioration in air quality near the surface, with particulate levels exceeding the regulation threshold. The results underscore the importance of accurately representing vertical mixing in smoke forecasts and illustrate the added value of routine ceilometer LDR measurements for real-time identification of lofted smoke plumes – information not attainable from column-integrated satellite products or surface monitors alone."

The Heidelberg Radon Monitor (HRM) measures 214polonium (Po), a progeny of Rn. This study presents Po-based Rn activity concentrations measured with the HRM at eight stations in Germany with guidelines for estimating Rn from Po measurements. Comparison between modeled and measured activity concentrations shows that at high relative humidity Po measurements cannot be interpreted as Rn. 
 Atmospheric measurements of the short-lived radioactive noble gas radon-222 (222Rn) have many applications. Its concentrations are driven by atmospheric mixing as well as seasonal variations, which follow the seasonality of 222Rn exhalation from continental soils, with lower values during the wet winter and spring months compared to more dry summer conditions. Hence, it can be used as a tracer to distinguish marine from continental air masses or for transport model validation. The Heidelberg Radon Monitor (HRM) is a static filter detector measuring atmospheric 214polonium (214Po), which is a progeny of 222Rn. These measurements can be used to infer atmospheric 222Rn activity concentrations if the radioactive disequilibrium between 214Po and 222Rn at the measurement site is known. In this study, 214Po activity concentrations measured with the HRM at eight stations in the Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) Germany  network are presented, along with guidelines for evaluating these data to estimate atmospheric 222Rn activity concentrations. In addition to the established line loss and disequilibrium corrections applied when sampling through long tubing or from air intake heights close to the ground, respectively, an upper limit for relative  humidity (RH) is suggested, where secular equilibrium can still be assumed. At higher RH, aerosol scavenging effects can cause disequilibrium between 214Po and 222Rn. Using comparison with the model this threshold is determined to be at about 98 % RH and was applied uniformly at all measurement sites. A clear diurnal cycle of 222Rn is observed at all German tower stations during the summer and autumn months as is a seasonal cycle with a maximum during summer and autumn months. Overall, our results demonstrate that the 214Po-based 222Rn measurements with the HRM are reliable if the equilibrium conditions between 214Po and 222Rn can be ensured, i.e., for air intake heights above 80–90 ma.g.l. during conditions with  RH<98 %.

Pure liquid water droplets are liquid until about −35 °C without the presence of a small subset of aerosols, ice-nucleating particles (INPs). These INPs lead to primary ice formation and therefore impact the phase of clouds. The dataset described herein provides INP concentration measurements at two altitudes. Connecting this data to synoptic conditions and ambient data might provide a better understanding of INPs in Finnish Lapland. 
 A novel filter-based sampler was deployed during the Pallas Cloud Experiment (PaCE) 2022 for a one-month period in September and October 2022 in Finnish Lapland around 5 km north of the Sammaltunturi station. This area frequently features low-level clouds during autumn. The sampler was deployed on-board of an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) and on the ground. Two filters were deployed simultaneously on the ground and on the UAV to enable a comparison between the two vertical levels. The dataset contains 9 ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentration spectra that feature a temporal overlap at both altitudes, a handling blank filter to assess possible contamination during handling and additional samples from both setups without the temporal overlap. The dataset is the first of its kind, providing altitude-based INP concentrations in Finnish Lapland, and is available at the Zenodo Open Science data archive (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13911633, Böhmländer et al., 2024). There is no clear systematic difference between INP concentrations measured at the different altitudes. The INP concentration is variable over the period measured and also does show some differences on the vertical level. The INP concentration at 253 K varies between 0.15 and 3.06 Lstd-1 on the ground, and between 0.48 and 1.69 Lstd-1 at higher altitudes. The connection to synoptic conditions and ambient measurements might provide a better understanding of the origin, lifetime, and distribution of INPs in Finnish Lapland."

One of these interactions happens due to a small subset of aerosols, ice-nucleating particles (INPs). These INPs lead to the freezing of pure water droplets above −35 °C, which otherwise would stay liquid. This has impacts on the weather and climate. The present data set presents a unique data set with a high temporal resolution. 
 The Portable Ice Nucleation Experiment (PINE) was deployed during the Pallas Cloud Experiment (PaCE) 2022 for a three-month-period at the Sammaltunturi station in autumn 2022 (between late September 2022 and late December 2022). The station is located on top of a hill on the edge between sub-Arctic and boreal forest environments, typically receiving air masses from the Arctic and the south. Since clouds are frequently present at the station during autumn, the present aerosol particles can have a direct impact on cloud properties. Ice-nucleating particles (INPs) are aerosol particles that facilitate primary ice nucleation in supercooled cloud droplets. The PINE measured the INP concentration with a high temporal resolution of six minutes at different nucleation temperatures between 240 and 252 K. The INP concentration varied exponentially with the freezing temperature and differences between different months were observed. The highest median INP concentration was measured during December over the whole temperature range, while during November the lowest median INP concentration was measured. The data presented here is useful to study aerosol-cloud interactions for a sub-Arctic location with minimal anthropogenic influence. The high temporal resolution allows to correlate the INP concentration with other measurements, such as size distribution data and meteorological data. In addition, the data provides the ice nucleating ability of ambient aerosol particles, which can be combined with models to study the nature, the source and the age of the INPs."

PaleoRiada, the first open palaeoflood database for Spain, addresses these issues by compiling data from 299 palaeoflood records, accessible through an open-access web platform. The database supports the revision of Potential Significant Flood Risk Areas and provides insights for regions not included in current national flood maps. 
 Palaeoflood records are natural evidence of past flood events (typically found in landforms, sediments, or vegetation). Over the last 25 years, several palaeoflood record databases have been implemented. However, many of these databases are outdated, lack accessible or comprehensive palaeohydrological information, and present challenges in terms of data accessibility and reuse, particularly for non-research communities (e.g. planning administrations or flood risk managers). This work introduces PaleoRiada, the first open database that compiles published palaeoflood records from Spain. PaleoRiada stores typological, hydrological, temporal, and spatial data collected from approximately 126 publications (including journal articles, scientific reports, and book chapters). This database has been implemented using a simple Relational Database Management System (RDMS), integrated into a web platform, and is freely accessible at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17391823 (Sandoval-Rincón et al., 2025). The PaleoRiada database contains 299 palaeoflood records (both geological and biological) dated between 2014 CE and 97 000 BP and distributed across both Atlantic (164) and Mediterranean (135) catchments. PaleoRiada includes 157 records with specific discharge values ranging from 0.02 to 320 m3km-2s-1. These records are associated with a variety of river systems, including wide alluvial plains (25), Mediterranean ephemeral streams (17), mountain torrents (36), and confined valley rivers (79). Additionally, they encompass overbank flood events (102), flash floods (48), dam failures (1), and hyperconcentrated flow events (6). The relationship between PaleoRiada and the Spanish Flood-prone Mapping Project (SNCZI) indicates that approximately 80 % of the PaleoRiada records are not included in the flood-prone areas defined by SNCZI. Therefore, several records can be consulted to prioritise or propose new areas for preliminary flood risk assessment. Accessibility and simplified data query and entry in PaleoRiada can facilitate the application of palaeoflood data in land planning and flood risk management."

To help improve emergency response, we created a global dataset called BRIGHT using both optical and radar images to detect building damage in any weather. We tested many artificial intelligence models and showed how well they work in real disaster scenes. This work can guide better tools for future disaster recovery and help save lives faster. 
 Disaster events occur around the world and cause significant damage to human life and property. Earth observation (EO) data enables rapid and comprehensive building damage assessment, an essential capability crucial in the aftermath of a disaster to reduce human casualties and inform disaster relief efforts. Recent research focuses on developing artificial intelligence (AI) models to accurately map unseen disaster events, mostly using optical EO data. These solutions based on optical data are limited to clear skies and daylight hours, preventing a prompt response to disasters. Integrating multimodal EO data, particularly combining optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, makes it possible to provide all-weather, day-and-night disaster responses. Despite this potential, the lack of suitable benchmark datasets has constrained the development of robust multimodal AI models. In this paper, we present a Building damage assessment dataset using veRy-hIGH-resoluTion optical and SAR imagery (Bright) to support AI-based all-weather disaster response. To the best of our knowledge, Bright is the first open-access, globally distributed, event-diverse multimodal dataset specifically curated to support AI-based disaster response. It covers five types of natural disasters and two types of human-made disasters across 14 regions worldwide, focusing on developing countries where external assistance is most needed. The dataset's optical and SAR images with spatial resolutions between 0.3 and 1 m provide detailed representations of individual buildings, making it ideal for precise damage assessment. We train seven advanced AI models on Bright to validate transferability and robustness. Beyond that, it also serves as a challenging benchmark for a variety of tasks in real-world disaster scenarios, including unsupervised domain adaptation, semi-supervised learning, unsupervised multimodal change detection, and unsupervised multimodal image matching. The experimental results serve as baselines to inspire future research and model development. The dataset (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14619797, Chen et al., 2025a), along with the code and pretrained models, is available at https://github.com/ChenHongruixuan/BRIGHT (last access: 7 November 2025) and will be updated as and when a new disaster data is available. Bright also serves as the official dataset for the 2025 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest Track II. We hope that this effort will promote the development of AI-driven methods in support of people in disaster-affected areas."

By comparing downwind and background conditions, the study revealed significant reductions in pollutants linked to traffic: -35.6 % for CO, -52.3 % for NOₓ, -56.7 % for eBC, and -15 % for CO2. These trends align with emission decrease estimates from AIRPARIF inventories over the same period. 
 CO2 is the main contributor to global warming, and cities now account for more than two-thirds of emissions of this gas. Atmospheric observatories located on the outskirts of cities are therefore important facilities for measuring the impact on atmospheric composition of the emission reductions planned by cities. The Saclay observatory, part of the ICOS and ACTRIS research infrastructures and located 20 km southwest of Paris, has been monitoring greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4), reactive gases (NOx, O3, CO), and carbonaceous aerosols (eBC) since 2012. This study presents 10 years of monitoring of these compounds, characterizing diurnal, seasonal cycles and decadal trends. In order to best characterize the impact of Parisian emissions, we defined two sets of data depending on whether the station is downwind of Paris or, conversely, in background conditions with westerly winds. This strategy allows us to characterize the urban offset in the Saclay measurement series. The results show a significant decrease in the urban offset of compounds mainly linked to traffic emissions: -35.6 %, -52.3 %, and -56.7 % for CO, NOx, and eBClf. There was also a 15 % decrease in urban offset of CO2 between the 2012–2017 and 2019–2022 periods, a figure consistent with the Airparif inventories' estimate of the decrease in emissions in Paris over the same period."

Climate simulations with injection are more expensive than standard future projections. We propose a method that dynamically scales the forcing fields based on pre-existing full-complexity data. This opens up possibilities for ensemble generation, new scenarios and higher resolution runs. We show that our method works for multiple model versions, injection scenarios and resolutions. 
 Climate model simulations incorporating stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) generally require more computational resources compared to out-of-the-box applications, due to the importance of stratospheric chemistry. This presents a challenge for SAI research, especially because there are numerous ways and scenarios through which SAI can be implemented. Here, we propose a novel application of pattern-scaling techniques that allows us to generate SAI forcing in the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) – a model without interactive stratospheric chemistry – using pre-existing data from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM), a state-of-the-art model with interactive stratospheric chemistry, but expensive to run. In doing so, a significant portion of the computational budget is saved. The present method requires a pre-existing dataset of a representative SAI experiment and its corresponding control experiment, with interactive stratospheric chemistry. The data is converted into a set of relations to determine the forcing fields given any required optical depth of the aerosol field. The present method is suitable for applications that use dynamical feedback controllers and is intended to aid impact research into the tropospheric and (sub)surface climate changes due to SAI. The results of climate simulations with aerosols prescribed by the present procedure are in close agreement with those from the full-complexity model, even for different model versions, horizontal resolutions and SAI forcing scenarios."

Including MD chemistry in GEOS‐Chem increases the global formic acid source by 11% but has otherwise minimal impact on the model chemistry.

The enhancements of perpendicular and parallel temperatures in this deep MH result in a quasi‐isotropic ion pitch angle distribution.

 Extreme precipitation events are driven by complex multiscale atmospheric dynamic interactions, fuelled by available moisture. They are expected to intensify with climate change, posing increasing risks to human communities and ecosystems. However, current low-resolution climate models struggle to accurately represent key extreme precipitation-generating phenomena, limiting our ability to generate robust and reliable future projections. Here we present an ensemble of climate simulations with a 10-to-25-km resolution and an improved representation of mesoscale convective systems to assess future changes in daily extreme precipitation and its drivers. Our high-resolution simulations more realistically capture the observed spatial distribution and intensity of daily extreme precipitation over the historical period than the 100-km resolution counterparts. In a future scenario with high carbon dioxide emissions, daily extreme precipitation over land could increase by about 41% by 2100, mainly as a result of increased mesoscale moisture convergence. The impact of this dynamical contribution to extreme precipitation is underestimated by a factor of three in the low-resolution model. These results highlight the crucial role of high-resolution climate modelling in constraining future extremes and informing more effective climate risk assessments and adaptation strategies.

 Thwaites and Pine Island glaciers—located in the Amundsen Sea Embayment, West Antarctica—are responsible for more than one-third of the total ice loss from Antarctica. These glaciers are experiencing accelerated retreat due to a combination of complex air–sea-ice processes. The ice cavities—the ocean-filled spaces beneath glaciers where the ice becomes afloat in the form of ice shelves—are particularly vulnerable to warm water intrusions but remain severely understudied due to their remote location and the lack of numerical models capable of resolving small-scale ice–ocean processes. Here we show that ocean submesoscale features (1–10 km size) regularly form in the open ocean, propagate towards Thwaites Glacier, intrude its cavity and melt the ice from below. We use an ice–ocean numerical model at 200-m resolution and observations below the ice to reveal that submesoscale motions are ubiquitous year round in the Amundsen Sea Embayment. Results show that submesoscales account for one-fifth of the total submarine melt variance in the area and highlight a positive feedback loop between submesoscale motions and submarine melting. Following this loop, as future climate warming implies greater ocean-induced melting, these events will become increasingly frequent, with far-reaching implications for ice-shelf stability and global sea-level rise.

 Therapeutic options for refractory depression are urgently needed. We conducted a deep brain stimulation (DBS) randomized controlled trial of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), an extended amygdala structure, and nucleus accumbens (NAc) in 26 refractory depression patients to assess treatment efficacy and predictors of response. BNST-NAc DBS had a 50% depression response rate and 35% remission rate in the open-label phase. We identified an objective intracranial physiological biomarker using acute and chronic intracranial recordings, machine learning, and an integrated framework combining electrophysiology, neuroimaging, and behavior: lower BNST theta and prefrontal-BNST coherence with top-down connectivity predicted better depression outcomes and quality-of-life after chronic stimulation at 3, 6 and 12 months, confirmed across eyes -open and -closed states and machine learning. We identified a physiology-guided connectivity network involving dorsal anterior cingulate and lateral inferior frontal cortex tracts. These biomarkers, linked to negative emotional bias and anxiety, highlight the efficacy of BNST-NAc DBS for refractory depression and has potential broader clinical implications.

 Spiders’ ability to spin foraging webs using silk from specialized glands represents a remarkable evolutionary innovation, yet the molecular evolution of silk glands remains unclear. Here, we investigated the evolution of silk glands in Araneoidea spiders through genomic and transcriptomic mining. After the divergence of the Araneoidea clade, numerous new genes with simplified structures and constrained expression emerged, expressed predominantly in silk glands and coexpressed with ancient genes to drive the evolution of silk glands. Among these, SpiCE-DS8, a newly evolved small secretory peptide unique to the Nephilinae subfamily, interacted with the N-terminal of MaSp1b and was incorporated into dragline silk, potentially aiding in silk solidification. In vitro wet-spinning experiments demonstrated that SpiCE-DS8 enhanced fiber properties, likely enabling spiders to arm their foraging webs for more efficient prey capture. These findings highlight the pivotal role of lineage-specific genes in silk gland evolution and provide insights for synthetic silk development.

 Non-invasive systemic visualization is crucial in biomedical research. Photoacoustic imaging transcends the optical scattering limitations, capturing optical absorption from deep tissue at high resolution. Nevertheless, the full exploitation of its physical advantages faces challenges due to unsatisfactory field of view (FOV), spatiotemporal resolution, and imaging quality. Here, we demonstrate that 3D panoramic photoacoustic computed tomography (3D-PanoPACT) mitigates these limitations by combining dynamical and functional contrasts, high spatiotemporal resolution, and broad three-dimensional FOV, allowing for visualizing cross-regional dynamics from organ to whole-body level. Leveraging its single-pulse-volumetric imaging capability, 3D-PanoPACT imaged the whole liver at 25 Hz, facilitating the extraction of arterial networks. Real-time monitoring of whole-brain vasculatures and functional hemodynamics induced by pharmacological action and physical stimulation was demonstrated, especially in the Circle of Willis. The dynamic visualization of the whole trunk at 10 Hz further substantiates its capacity for systemic imaging. We tracked the metabolic pathways of a small-molecule probe across multiple organs using 3D-PanoPACT, highlighting its value in whole-body, cross-regional dynamic studies. 3D-PanoPACT, being a potent novel imaging tool, exhibits substantial potential for advancing biotechnology.

Here, the authors show that cytosolic TBC1D1 inhibits nuclear entry of the AS160-STAT3 complex and regulates MuSC proliferation. Deficiency of TBC1D1 improves muscle regeneration. 
 The Rab GTPase activating protein (RabGAP) AS160 translocates from the cytosol into the nucleus acting as a transcriptional co-activator of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) to regulate proliferation of muscle satellite cells (MuSCs). How this AS160–STAT3 complex is regulated remains largely unclear yet. Here, we show that TBC1D1, a RabGAP related to AS160, forms a super-complex with AS160 and STAT3 to retain the AS160–STAT3 complex in the cytosol. Phosphorylation of TBC1D1-Thr596 by protein kinase B dissociates TBC1D1 from AS160 thus releasing the cytosolic retention of the AS160–STAT3 complex. A non-phosphorylatable alanine substitution of Thr596 inhibits MuSC proliferation and impairs repair of injured muscle. In contrast, TBC1D1 deficiency, but not its GAP-inactive mutation, promotes MuSC proliferation and muscle regeneration. Thus, TBC1D1 is a negative regulator of MuSC proliferation through cytosolic retention of the AS160–STAT3 complex and might be a valuable therapeutic target for muscle regeneration. MuSCs are vital for muscle renewal with unclear regulatory mechanisms. Here, the authors show that cytosolic TBC1D1 inhibits nuclear entry of the AS160-STAT3 complex and regulates MuSC proliferation.

 Strong coupling between distinct quasiparticles in condensed matter systems gives rise to hybrid states with emergent properties. We demonstrate the hybridization of confined phonons and finite-wavelength magnons, forming a magnon-polaron cavity with tunable coupling strength and spatial confinement controlled by the applied magnetic field direction. Our platform consists of a low-loss, single-crystalline yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film coupled to a zinc oxide (ZnO)-based surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonator. This heterostructure enables exceptionally low magnon-polaron dissipation rates below κ/2π < 1.5 MHz. The observed mode hybridization is well described by a phenomenological model incorporating the spatial profiles of magnon and phonon modes. Furthermore, we report the first observation of Rabi-like oscillations in a coupled SAW-spin wave system, revealing the dynamical formation of magnon-polarons in the time domain. These results establish a platform for engineering hybrid spin-acoustic excitations in extended magnetic systems and enable time-resolved studies of magnon-polaron states.

Here, by mapping accessible chromatin during early embryonic development of Xenopus tropicalis, the authors show how maternal factors E2f1 and Otx1 work together to control zygotic genome activation. 
 Zygotic genome activation is tightly associated with the modulation of chromatin accessibility via maternal transcription factors. Understanding how chromatin accessibility is established and identifying key maternal regulators are crucial to comprehending this process. Here, by developing CANTAC-seq, we generate a genome-wide map of accessible chromatin of early Xenopus tropicalis embryos and find that the open chromatin landscape is progressively established at cis-regulatory elements during zygotic genome activation. Based on the motif analysis and perturbation experiments, we demonstrate that E2f1 maintains a repressive chromatin environment and inhibits zygotic gene transcription before the mid-blastula transition. Moreover, we identify that Otx1, another maternal transcriptional activator, coordinates with E2f1 in regulating chromatin accessibility and zygotic genome activation. Together, E2f1 and Otx1 determine the timely expression of a subset of genes required for zygotic gene transcription and germ layer differentiation. Zygotic genome activation coincides with extensive chromatin remodeling coordinated by maternal transcription factors.

 The potential death toll of exceptional extreme heat events is crucial for climate risk analysis and adaptation planning but may not be captured by existing projections. Here we combine machine learning-based projections of five historical European heat waves under present or future global temperatures with empirical exposure–response functions to quantify the potential for extreme heat events to generate mass mortality. For example, if August 2003 meteorological conditions recur at the recent annual global temperature anomaly of 1.5 °C, we project 17,800 excess deaths across Europe in one week, rising to 32,000 at 3 °C. This mortality is comparable to peak COVID-19 mortality in Europe and is not substantially reduced by climate adaptation currently observed across Europe. Our results suggest that while mitigating further global warming can reduce heat mortality, mass mortality events remain plausible at near-future temperatures despite current adaptations to heat.

Reichle;Seung-bum Kim;Ruhollah Taghizadeh-Mehrjardi;Jeffrey Walker;Liujun Zhu;Carsten Montzka,Soil moisture retrieval from Sentinel-1: Lessons learned after more than a decade in orbit,"•A decade of Sentinel-1-based retrievals has aided the global soil moisture record. •Vegetation effects issues and data assimilation conflicts require further research. •Non-homogeneous landscapes require an enhanced representation of soil roughness. •In arid & semi-arid areas, InSAR-derived soil moisture retrievals appear promising. •Operational readiness hinges on stronger validation and new observation modes. 
 Soil moisture is a critical variable for hydrology, agriculture and climate. However, large-scale soil moisture observation remains difficult due to sparse in situ networks and the inability of optical sensors to capture it under cloud cover. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) missions, e.g., Sentinel-1, yield unique all-weather, day and night observations with a fine spatial and temporal resolution that makes them of interest for development of global soil moisture monitoring. Consequently, this review discusses the application of C-band SAR observations from the Sentinel-1 satellite mission to estimate high-resolution near-surface soil moisture. First, the importance of SAR backscatter monitoring from Sentinel-1 is emphasized. Next, the current state-of-the-art in soil moisture retrieval from Sentinel-1 is presented. Although considerable progress has been made in near-surface soil moisture retrieval, several limitations remain. Factors such as the effects of vegetation and surface roughness on the signal, sensor and scattering model limitations, spatial and temporal constraints, and uncertainties, e.g. in data assimilation, pose challenges to its usage. While Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based retrieval methods have shown promise, their interpretability, dependence on large datasets, vulnerability to data quality, and computational burden have been major challenges. Beyond methods that rely on backscatter, there have been recent works indicating that SAR interferometric observables have the potential to estimate soil moisture, especially in arid and semi-arid regions where these are particularly sensitive to moisture changes. To address these challenges, this paper recommends integrating Sentinel-1 with other satellite mission data for a multi-sensor data integration approach (e.g., Sentinel-2 and Soil Moisture Active Passive - SMAP data), refining physical and semi-empirical models, developing advanced AI techniques able to consider physical principles, and combining with emerging data from other high temporal resolution SAR missions (e.g., NASA-ISRO SAR). The review concludes with identification of key research priorities, including standardization of retrieval frameworks, improved validation efforts on standardized reference sets, and cloud processing for real-time user cases. Overall, the review provides a thorough foundation for understanding, refining, and advancing Sentinel-1 based soil moisture retrieval methods."

 Soil moisture plays a crucial role in regulating land-atmosphere interactions, directly influencing hydrological and ecological processes. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has significant advantages in soil moisture retrieval; however, the accuracy of retrieval under different land cover conditions requires further investigation. This study systematically evaluates the performance of optical and radar-derived Vegetation Indices (VIs) in the WCM-Oh coupling model using Sentinel-1C-band dual-polarization SAR data, covering five land cover types (grassland, crops, shrubland, forest and desert). Additionally, a new radar-based vegetation index, SVIdp, is proposed and tested for the first time. This index is based on the interaction of dual-polarization scattering components. The results show: (1) The WCM-Oh model significantly improved retrieval accuracy in typical vegetation areas (grasslands and crops), with the correlation coefficient (R) increasing by 0.10 and the root mean square error (RMSE) decreasing by 2 %–14 %, compared to the independent WCM model; (2) Under different land cover types, the WCM-Oh2004 coupling model based on GNDVI demonstrated high prediction accuracy (R = 0.66–0.85, ubRMSE = 0.0392–0.0698 m3/m3) in areas with moderate vegetation cover (e.g., grassland A, herbaceous vegetation A/B, wheat/corn rotation areas). However, areas such as alpine grasslands, artificial lawns, sparse vegetation, and tea plantations exhibited asymmetric errors, with underestimations in low-value regions and overestimations in high-value regions; (3) Performance of different vegetation indices: Biochemical optical indices (e.g., GNDVI, CVI) performed best in herbaceous vegetation areas, while structural radar indices (e.g., DpSVI, RVI) demonstrated superior stability in dense or structurally complex vegetation areas; (4) SVIdp outperformed DpRVI and NDVI in shrublands and grasslands.

 Plant traits serve as critical indicators of how plants adapt to environmental changes and influence ecosystem functions. While airborne hyperspectral remote sensing effectively maps plant traits through detailed reflectance properties, it is limited by cost and scale, making large-scale and temporal studies challenging. The recently launched spaceborne hyperspectral imager, PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA), offers frequent, large scale and high-fidelity observations on a spatial resolution of 30 m and a revisit time of around 29 days, making it suitable for large-scale seasonal trait mapping. However, their potential remains largely unexplored. This study developed a multi-stage framework by leveraging the PRISMA spaceborne hyperspectral data and National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) hyperspectral data to investigate the seasonal dynamics of four key plant traits — chlorophyll content, carotenoid content, equivalent water thickness, and nitrogen content — across eleven NEON sites representing diverse forest types and ecoregions in the contiguous U.S. Our results demonstrated that PRISMA hyperspectral data can reliably track seasonal variability in plant traits, achieving overall R2 values ranging from 0.78 to 0.88 and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) values ranging from 5.4 % to 8.4 % for the four traits. Seasonal patterns revealed bell-shaped trajectories for chlorophyll and carotenoids, while equivalent water thickness decreased steadily across most sites, driven by structural changes during leaf maturation and senescence. Nitrogen content exhibited less pronounced seasonal variation but followed expected nutrient resorption patterns. Analysis of environmental drivers showed that seasonal variability is primarily controlled by solar radiation and day length in northern sites, vapor pressure in semi-arid regions, and temperature in mid-southeastern sites. Spatial variability, meanwhile, was primarily driven by soil properties, particularly during the peak growing season. However, the influence of soil variables slightly declines toward the end of the season at several sites, as climatic factors become more prominent. This study highlights the capability of PRISMA, and potentially other similar spaceborne hyperspectral data for large-scale, time-series plant trait mapping and provides valuable insights into the interactions between plant traits and environmental factors. These findings contribute to advancing our understanding of plant functional ecology and improving predictions of ecosystem responses to environmental changes."

 Sun-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) is the most promising remote-sensing proxy of Gross Primary Production (GPP) in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the estimation of GPP using SIF is challenging when plants experience stress, particularly during extreme climatic events whose frequency is projected to increase in the future. Recently, the feasibility of canopy-level active chlorophyll fluorescence measurements (LED-induced chlorophyll fluorescence), which directly measure the apparent fluorescence yield (FyieldLIF), has provided new perspectives on detecting the responses of plants to stress. This study was conducted during the summer 2022 European heat waves in a mixed temperate deciduous broadleaf forest, located in the French Fontainebleau-Barbeau station. Continuous measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2) and energy exchanges, SIF, FyieldLIF, and ancillary environmental variables were acquired. We investigated how heat-wave induced high atmospheric dryness, measured as Vapor Pressure Deficit, affected canopy chlorophyll fluorescence (both SIF and FyieldLIF) and GPP, as well as their relationships. At the half-hourly scale, our results revealed a decrease of the correlation between SIF and GPP (R2 decreased from 0.49 to 0.17) at high atmospheric dryness. In contrast, the correlation between FyieldLIF and GPP increased significantly under high atmospheric dryness (R2 increased from 0.07 to 0.43). However, at the daily scale, the correlations between SIF and GPP and between FyieldLIF and GPP showed an overall increase compared to the half-hourly scale, suggesting a time-scale-dependent response of these relationships to atmospheric dryness. This study also highlighted FyieldLIF's advantage in detecting plant responses to high atmospheric dryness, and emphasized the potential of canopy-level active chlorophyll fluorescence for assessing the chlorophyll fluorescence-photosynthesis relationship under extreme climatic conditions."

 The rapid expansion of rice-crayfish farming in China has triggered significant land-use transformations, yet long-term mapping of these patterns remains challenging due to sample limitations and spectral complexities.

In our article, we attempted to assess the hydromorphological condition of rivers based on available riverscape photos in Google Street View (GSV). In accordance with the River Habitat Survey protocol, one of the classic methods of assessing the hydromorphological condition implemented worldwide, we assessed the parameters of the hydromorphological condition of 60 stretches of selected Polish rivers located in different regions of the country, having specific and different physiographic features (slope, flow velocity, discharge, degree of modification). Then, based on available multimedia materials (GSV photos), we independently assessed the same parameters affecting the class of the hydromorphological condition of rivers and performed a comparative statistical analysis. No statistically significant difference between the assessment of the hydromorphological river status using the standard RHS field protocol and the assessment using GSV (p values of the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test 0.19 – 0.98). Although the results require further verification on larger data sets, we see significant potential for using GSV in supplementing field methods of river hydromorphology assessment with this data.

 Mitigating volcanic eruption disasters is a key priority in Indonesia’s national development agenda. Due to the high density of active volcanoes near populated areas, even eruptions with a relatively low Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) can result in significant fatalities and losses. Therefore, rapid mapping of eruption impacts is essential both during and following an eruption. Machine learning with Earth Observation (EO) data enhances the speed and accuracy of volcanic impact mapping, critical for timely disaster response. In this study, we evaluate the performance of three machine learning classifiers − Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost – for mapping land surface changes resulting from volcanic deposits (e.g. lahars, pyroclastic density currents and lava) across three different data availability scenarios using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 optical data. Scenario I use a traditional approach, where training and validation data are sourced from the same eruption event. In Scenario II, the spatial transfer scenario, we simulate the absence of local training data by using data from different volcanoes. In Scenario III, the spatial–temporal transfer scenario, we include training data from past eruptions of the target volcano in addition to other events. Our results demonstrate that Scenario I achieve the highest classification accuracy, with Random Forest and XGBoost consistently outperforming SVM, achieving f1-scores exceeding 0.90. Scenario III improves average model performance compared to Scenario II (Δf1-score – 0.12), highlighting the value of historical eruption data for enhancing classification accuracy in data-scarce environments. These findings underscore the critical role of integrating EO data and machine learning in advancing volcanic impact mapping, offering a scalable and efficient approach to support disaster management efforts globally."

 Excessive groundwater pumping is a significant driver of land deformation, potentially threatening regional geological stability. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has been widely used to monitor such deformation. However, existing studies primarily focus on retrieving InSAR line-of-sight (LOS) or ground vertical deformation, limiting insights into three-dimensional (3D) ground displacements driven by subsurface processes. To address this, we propose a novel approach for modeling 3D surface displacement by integrating dual-orbit Multi-Temporal InSAR measurements with multiple prior deformation models. Specifically, we first estimate two sets of 3D displacements using a Bayesian approach by integrating dual-orbit InSAR measurements into prior models. Subsequently, bidirectional matching is employed to identify reliable homologous points, which are then used to reconstruct the complete horizontal displacement fields through the surface horizontal force equilibrium equation. Following the proposed methodology, for multi-track and high-coherence data, minimum acceleration (MinA) combination, multiple-aperture interferometry (MAI), and burst-overlap interferometry (BOI) techniques can serve as alternatives to conventional approaches. Moreover, incorporating along-track motion will further enhance 3D deformation estimation using SAR data. In the Lorca basin, Spain, we utilized Sentinel-1A ascending and descending SAR images to construct high-precision 3D cumulative displacement fields between October 7, 2015, to March 24, 2017. The experimental results reveal a maximum cumulative subsidence of 121.5 mm and notable horizontal displacements with a peak magnitude of 18.6 mm, a component that has received limited attention in earlier studies. The proposed approach eliminates the need for ground-based observations and yields improvements of 33.7 %, 51.3 %, and 43.9 % in the accuracy of vertical, east–west, and north–south deformation components, respectively, compared to the SMVCE method that integrates both InSAR and GNSS data. This study addresses the low sensitivity of InSAR in monitoring north–south displacement induced by groundwater extraction, offering new evidence to elucidate deformation mechanisms and providing valuable implications for sustainable groundwater management and geohazard mitigation."

 Mapping forest landscape fragmentation (FLF) after fires is essential for maintaining ecosystem balance, reducing fire-related losses, and minimizing environmental damage. However, the “salt-and-pepper” phenomenon complicates accurate FLF mapping at fine resolutions (≤ 10 m) in mountainous regions. To relieve the phenomenon, this study used the multi-vegetation index (MVI) to represent FLF and applied the Simple Non-Iterative Clustering (SNIC) algorithm to convert pixels into objects before classification, and then SNIC-MVI RF was introduced to map FLF using Sentinel-2 imagery and land use data. In combination with topographical and meteorological data, the Geodetector was employed to analyze the influencing factors on FLF patterns across different fire severity ranges. The results indicate that: (1) The proposed SNIC-MVI RF can accurately retrieve FLF across a range of fire severity using 10-m Sentinel-2 imagery while mitigating the “salt-and-pepper” phenomenon, with an average precision of 96.2 % and an average F1-score of 97.4 %. (2) The FLF spatial patterns exhibit significant differences across fire severity. Low fire severity (LFS) leads to an increase in the number of small patches, moderate fire severity (MFS) results in more complex patch edges, and high fire severity (HFS) promotes greater patch aggregation. (3) Pre-fire meteorological conditions and vegetation cover are major influences on the spatial patterns of FLF under different fire severities. This study will provide a new method for exploring the impact of different fire severities on FLF in central Yunnan. As an important indicator for assessing ecological disturbance and habitat degradation, analyzing the response of fragmentation to different fire severities can help administrators evaluate the impacts of fire on FLF more scientifically and develop more targeted and sustainable forest management and ecological restoration strategies."

Tai observatory,"•Primary air pollutants decreased from the ground surface to the free troposphere during COVID-19. •O3and Oxlevels at Mt. Tai remained stable, contrasting with sharp increases at ground-level sites. •PM2.5rose significantly at Mt. Tai, driven by enhanced secondary aerosol formation. 
 To prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19), China adopted a series of rigorous containment measures, resulting in dramatic anthropogenic emission reductions, and thus exerted great influences on air quality. Ground-based measurements reported notable decrease in major air pollutants such as CO, NOx, SO2, PM2.5 during the lockdown period, however, O3 concentration increased markedly due to the alleviated NO-titration. However, the impact of these emission reductions on the regional air quality in the free troposphere remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated the influence of the emission reductions on air pollutant concentrations at the summit of Mt. Tai, which lies above the identifiable residual layer (RL) and planetary boundary layer (PBL) during wintertime and is therefore representative of the lower free troposphere over the central North China Plain (NCP). Our results showed that during the lockdown period, NO2, SO2, and CO concentrations decreased significantly by 37.1 %, 27.6 % and 23.4 %, respectively, compared to the pre-COVID period. O3 and Ox concentrations remained largely unchanged, but PM2.5 concentrations increased significantly by 21.9 %, diverging from most ground-level stations. Combined with the RACM-CAPRAM model simulations, the result suggests that the increased in PM2.5 was mainly attributed to enhanced secondary aerosol formation, as indicated by enhanced formation of sulfate, nitrate, ammonium and organic aerosol component associated with aqueous-phase reactions. This enhancement was more pronounced during nighttime. These findings suggest that enhanced secondary aerosol formation during the lockdown period can offset primary emission reductions, contributing to the elevation of PM2.5 in the free troposphere of the NCP."

 In this study the emission-driven aerosol–meteorology feedback on winter PM2.5 variations in Central and East China (CEC) from 2014 to 2020 is examined by applying the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with Chemistry. Emission reductions from 2014 to 2020 led to increases in downward shortwave radiation at the surface, 2-m temperature and planetary boundary layer height, as well as decreases in 2-m relative humidity in the central part of CEC. This also led to an increase in precipitation and a decrease in the liquid water path in the southern part of CEC. The change in the PM2.5 concentration induced by aerosol‒meteorology feedback (ΔM PM2.5) was −10 μg m−3 to −5 μg m−3 in eastern Hunan Province and −5 μg m−3 to −2 μg m−3 in other CEC regions. The average percentages of ΔM PM2.5 relative to the total change in the PM2.5 concentration due to emission reduction were 9.8 %, 5.7 %, 5.6 %, 9.2 %, and 20.3 % for CEC, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), the Fenwei Plain (FWP), the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and the Pearl River Delta (PRD), respectively. In the central part of CEC, the contribution of aerosol‒radiation interaction (ARI) dominated, with a very slight contribution from aerosol‒cloud interaction (ACI). In the southern part of CEC, both ACI and ARI contributed to ΔM PM2.5, with ACI playing a more significant role. ΔM PM2.5 exhibited distinct diurnal variations in the BTH, the FWP, and the YRD, with greater contributions during the day and smaller contributions at night, which was attributed primarily to the diurnal variation in the ARI contribution. This study emphasizes the necessity of considering aerosol–meteorology feedback when assessing the effects of emission control measures on PM2.5 concentrations."

 Aerosol-Radiation Interaction (ARI) and Aerosol-Cloud Interaction (ACI) significantly affect radiation budgets and hydrological cycles. However, quantifying the contribution of anthropogenic aerosols to regional precipitation remains a major challenge. In this study, utilizing the Regional Climate Model version 5 (RegCM5), we unraveled the mechanisms related to the disparities between daytime and nighttime in the impact of the anthropogenic aerosols on the summer precipitation over the middle and lower Yangtze River Basin (MLYRB). The results indicate that the ARI decreases the daily total precipitation amount (PA) by 0.05 mm (12 h)−1 and precipitation frequency (PF) by 0.74 %. This suppression occurs primarily through a reduction in daytime convective precipitation, driven by radiative cooling (up to 14.02 W m−2 reduction in surface net shortwave radiation) that enhances lower-atmospheric stability, manifested as a significant suppression of the planetary boundary layer height (PBLH), leading to moisture divergence and widespread subsidence. Compared to ARI, ACI exerts a stronger suppression, reducing daily total PA (PF) by 0.16 mm (12 h)−1 (1.91 %) mainly by reducing daytime light to moderate convective precipitation. This is attributed to increased high cloud cover (3.89 %), which reduces surface net radiation and profoundly enhances atmospheric stability, quantified by a significant reduction in Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE), thereby weakening ascending motion. This study quantifies that ACI has a stronger impact than ARI, and both effects are significantly more pronounced during the daytime, revealing the critical role of diurnal processes in modulating aerosol-precipitation interactions."

 Despite increasing concern over PM2.5 exposure, high-resolution, real-time assessments of elemental health risks, integrated with source attribution and diurnal variability, remain scarce in rapidly urbanizing cities. This study presents near-real-time, multi-site monitoring of PM2.5-bound trace elements through a mobile laboratory platform-assisted campaign using an Xact-625i in a major city of the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) in India. We conducted measurements across four land-use categories, residential, industrial, commercial, and traffic-dominated, over two seasonal cycles: Cycle-I (post-monsoon to early winter) and Cycle-II (late winter to early summer). Elemental concentrations showed a twofold increase during Cycle-I, driven by poor atmospheric dispersion and enhanced combustion activities. Across both cycles, the industrial site consistently recorded the highest concentrations due to proximity to continuous emissions. An episodic event, the Diwali fireworks period, resulted in extreme concentration spikes, peaking at 367.5 μg/m3. Health risk assessment, conducted with and without the episodic event, employed deterministic and probabilistic (Monte Carlo) approaches across both cycles. Mn and Cr6+, emitted primarily from traffic-related sources, dominated non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks, respectively. The event increased the non-carcinogenic risk from 1.44 to 1.98 and doubled the probability of risk exceedance from 49.8 % to 99.67 %. Source apportionment using positive matrix factorization resolved traffic, industrial, combustion, and fireworks-related emissions, with the non-exhaust factor contributing >35 % to both risk categories. Diurnal risk analysis identified high exposure windows during morning and evening hours across both cycles, aligned with urban activity patterns. This mobile laboratory platform framework enables real-time urban pollution hotspots mapping, identification of high-exposure windows, and source characterization to support targeted air quality and public health interventions."

 Based on CLARA-A2, TRMM-3B43, and ERA5 datasets, this study analyzes the influence of environmental conditions and cloud properties on Potential Cloud Precipitation Capacity (PCPA) over China, with a specific focus on the physical mechanisms underlying their differential dependence between dry and wet years. Results show that annual precipitation in wet years is significantly higher than in dry years, particularly in South China (SC), the Sichuan Basin (SB), and Northeast China (NE), where the difference exceeds 50 mm. Increased cloud fraction cover (CFC), liquid water path (LWP), and ice water path (IWP) during wet years provide more favorable conditions for precipitation. Among meteorological environmental factors, Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE), low-level relative humidity (RH), and surface latent heat flux (SLHF) significantly influence PCPA. CAPE increases in wet years, promoting precipitation, the positive influence of RH on PCPA strengthens when RH exceeds 50 %, and SLHF exhibits a significant positive correlation with PCPA in the wet years over the Tarim Basin (TB) and NE. Correlation analysis between cloud attributes and PCPA indicates that CF, LWP, and IWP are generally positively correlated with PCPA. However, within perennial cloudy background in SB, LWP shows a negative correlation with PCPA. The liquid cloud particle effective radius (LREF) is positively correlated with PCPA in SC and NE, whereas the ice cloud particle effective radius (IREF) generally exhibits a negative correlation. Comparing dry and wet years reveals that PCPA in the TB and NE is more sensitive to changes in cloud properties during wet years. This study highlights distinct cloud-precipitation interactions across different typical regions over China, providing a scientific basis for cloud water resources development and utilization."

 We reported on the nighttime observations of totally 20 transient luminous events (TLEs), including ten produced by negative cloud-to-ground (CG) strokes, over a coastal thunderstorm in South China on August 28, 2021. The lightning activity in this thunderstorm exhibited typical characteristics for coastal thunderstorms, with intense negative single-stroke flashes accounting for 76 % of all flashes with peak current exceeding −200 kA. Remarkably, most of the negative CG flashes related to TLE observations spawned only one negative CG stroke with high peak current (typically > −100 kA). Moreover, the outbreak of TLEs with elves and halo features requiring high peak current is likely linked to the intensification of convection in the thunderstorm, which occurred while the thunderstorm approached the coastline from the open sea, followed by a substantial growth in the cloud-top height and radar reflectivity. On the other hand, red sprites produced by positive CG strokes were observed almost throughout the observation period, with peak currents (averaging at +63 kA) much smaller than that of negative sprite-producing CG strokes. Overall, the TLE observations over this particular thunderstorm provide more insights into the TLE phenomenology of oceanic thunderstorms, and our analyses contribute to a better understanding on how oceanic thunderstorms affect the middle and upper atmosphere by producing intense negative CG strokes."

 Skillful prediction of large-scale environmental conditions is essential for reliable seasonal forecasting of tropical cyclone (TC) activity. However, the capability of current state-of-the-art operational models in predicting these conditions remains unclear due to limited evaluation. This study evaluates the performance of the Climate Forecast System (CFS) in predicting the Dynamic Genesis Potential Index (DGPI)—a metric that integrates large-scale conditions influencing TC genesis—in the Western North Pacific (WNP), focusing on interannual variability in both spatial distribution and basin-wide mean values. Results show that CFS exhibits limited skill in capturing DGPI spatial variability, with a mean spatial correlation of only 0.21 during 1990–2022. While CFS Reforecast predictions (1990–2010) capture interannual variability well in basin-mean DGPI (r = 0.71), the operational CFSv2 forecasts (2011−2022) perform poorly (r = 0.19), mainly due to an inability to reproduce mean state changes. To address this limitation, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models were developed, initially trained on Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) historical simulations and then refined through transfer learning with reanalysis data. The CNN models significantly improve DGPI prediction skill, achieving a mean spatial correlation of 0.85 for anomaly fields during 2011–2022 and a strong correlation with observed basin-mean DGPI (r = 0.88), markedly outperforming CFSv2. These findings highlight the potential of CNN-based approaches to enhance seasonal forecasting of TC genesis in the WNP."
