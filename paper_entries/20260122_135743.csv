 Vertical profiles of pollen and biomass burning particles were obtained at the MeteoSwiss station of Payerne (Switzerland) using a novel multi-channel elastic-fluorescence lidar combined with in situ measurements during the spring 2023 wildfires and pollination season during the PERICLES (PayernE lidaR and Insitu detection of fluorescent bioaerosol and dust partiCLES and their cloud impacts) campaign. This original approach provided, for the first time in this region, reliable information on pollen speciation aloft, bridging the gap between ground-based sampling and remote sensing observations. Pollen particles were detected near ground (up to 2 km height), showing strong fluorescence backscatter coefficients (bF) (up to 8×10-4 Mm−1 sr−1). Smoke plumes from Canada and Germany were detected at higher altitudes (3–5 km) with lower bF values compared to those from pollen particles near ground. In situ measurements and in vivo fluorescence spectra were used to classify pollen particles near ground. Ice nucleating particle (INP) concentrations relevant for mixed-phase clouds were enhanced at warm temperatures, characteristic of the contribution of biological particles to the INP population. This was further supported by the correlation between INPs at −14 °C and fluorescent bioaerosol particles detected by the Wideband Integrated Bioaerosol Sensor, while INPs at −20 °C were more strongly linked to coarse-mode dust. Comparison of bF values from two European Laser Induced Fluorescence lidar stations revealed that aged air masses containing smoke particles exhibited ∼ 50 % lower fluorescence during long-range transport in the free troposphere, possibly due to photochemical aging, mixing with non-fluorescent particles and dispersion."

These models show large discrepancies in simulating the interannual variability of historical dust emissions, as well as the relative importance of wind speed versus hydroclimate drivers. This study underscores the need to improve near-surface wind simulations in hyperarid areas and land surface process representations in arid and semiarid areas to reduce dust emission uncertainties. 
 Windblown dust emissions are controlled by near-surface wind speed and sediment erodibility, the latter modulated by hydroclimate and land-use conditions. Accurate representations of these drivers are critical for reproducing historical dust variability and projecting future dust changes in Earth system models (ESMs). This study examines the discrepancies among 21 ESMs in the relative importance of wind speed versus five hydroclimate drivers in explaining the historical (1980–2014) variability of dust emissions from global drylands. In hyperarid areas, models show poor agreement in the simulated dust variability, with only 9 % out of 210 inter-model comparisons exhibiting significant positive correlations. In contrast, arid and semiarid areas exhibit a dual pattern driven by a “double-edged sword” effect of land surface memory: models with coherent hydroclimate variability show better agreement, whereas those with divergent hydroclimate representations show larger disagreement. While the ESMs capture the dominant role of wind speed in hyperarid areas, they diverge markedly in the relative contributions of wind and hydroclimate drivers in arid and semiarid areas. Replacing the Zender et al. (2003) dust scheme with the Kok et al. (2014) scheme in CESM and E3SM generally strengthens hydroclimate influences while reducing wind speed contributions to simulated dust variability. MERRA-2 reanalysis produces stronger wind influences than most ESMs across all dryland regions. These results underscore the need for improved near-surface wind simulations in hyperarid areas and more realistic land surface and hydroclimate representations in arid and semiarid areas to reduce uncertainties in global dust emission simulations."

T. Pye;Jingyi Li;Linghan Zeng;Song Guo;Min Hu;Jianlin Hu,Evaluating simulations of organic aerosol volatility and degree of oxygenation in eastern China,"We evaluated how well a widely used air quality model simulates key properties of organic particles in the atmosphere, such as volatility and oxygen content, which influence how particles age, spread, and affect both air quality and climate. Using observations in eastern China, we found the model underestimated particle mass and misrepresented their properties. Our results highlight the need for improved emissions and chemical treatments to better predict air quality and climate impacts. 
 Volatility and oxygen-to-carbon (O/C) molar ratios are critical properties of organic aerosols (OA), influencing their viscosity, hygroscopicity, and light absorption thereby resulting in impacts on air quality and climate. While atmospheric models often track these properties to simulate OA evolution, their performance remains insufficiently evaluated. This study assessed OA volatility and O/C simulations by comparing CMAQ model outputs using official AERO7i and community-contributed two-dimensional volatility basis set (2D-VBS) schemes, against two field measurements in eastern China. Apart from baseline modelling, two additional simulations using AERO7i incrementally incorporated low-volatility/semi-volatile/intermediate-volatility organic compound (L/S/IVOC) emissions and enhanced anthropogenic secondary organic aerosol (SOA) yields. An optimized 2D-VBS simulation further constrained O/C ratios of primary organic aerosol (POA) emissions using observations. The results showed that OA mass concentrations were underestimated by 24 % in 2D-VBS and 27 %–34 % with updated AERO7i, likely due to underrepresented vehicular POA emissions and nighttime SOA formation. All simulations captured the substantial contribution of low-volatility products (C*<0.1 µg m−3) but failed to reproduce the detailed volatility distributions within this range. Simulated O/C ratios were biased low in aged air masses (notably with 2D-VBS) and slightly overestimated in areas with more local emissions using updated AERO7i. Misrepresentations of OA volatility significantly led to biases in viscosity predictions, while the hygroscopicity parameter played a more important role. These findings highlight the need to better constrain OA volatility and O/C in models to improve projections of OA air quality and climate impacts."

We demonstrate that a graph-based approach – leveraging spatial information from sensor networks – can significantly enhance Ta forecasting at individual locations. Furthermore, we introduce an automated framework to streamline graph construction and model implementation. This study also demonstrates the distinct spatiotemporal dynamics of intra-city Ta patterns. 
 Air temperature (Ta) has critical implications for various socioeconomic sectors, yet its dynamics are particularly complex in urban areas due to heterogeneous built environments, landscapes, and diverse anthropogenic activities. Physics-based models struggle with intra-city Ta forecasts due to inadequate urban representation and limited spatial resolution. While weather observation networks offer promising alternatives for direct modeling with local Ta time-series, an effective framework to leverage these intra-city discrete sensor data remains lacking. Here, we demonstrate that graph neural networks (GNNs) can harness observation network information to refine Ta prediction at individual locations and elucidate underlying mechanisms. Our novel Mix-n-Scale framework with GNNs achieves over 12 % improvement in short-term Ta forecasts compared to conventional local time-series approaches. Further model evaluation disentangles performance variations with local Ta variability in diverse spatiotemporal contexts, indicating distinct patterns of intra-city heterogeneity across seasonal and diurnal scales. Our findings establish graph-based approaches for leveraging proliferating urban sensor data and advancing understanding of Ta spatiotemporal dynamics in complex urban environments."

We found that unusual sea surface warming patterns in the midlatitude Indian Ocean can disrupt winds and temperatures in the middle atmosphere, including the stratosphere and mesosphere, of the Southern Hemisphere. These disturbances alter ozone and air movement and may affect polar climate. Our results highlight the need to include Indian Ocean variability in climate models for better predictions. 
 An index representing the midlatitude Indian Ocean Dipole (MIOD) is  derived from the second empirical orthogonal function (EOF) mode of  austral winter (JJA) sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies to examine its impact on the Southern Hemisphere middle and upper atmosphere. ERA5 reanalysis datasets, together with satellite observations and WACCM6 simulations, are used to analyze the associated atmospheric responses to MIOD. The results show pronounced but asymmetric impacts between positive and negative events, primarily driven by differences in wavenumber-1 planetary wave activity. Positive MIOD events enhance planetary-wave  propagation from the Indian Ocean sector, leading to momentum deposition, variations in temperature, zonal winds, as well as a strengthening of the residual meridional circulation. These dynamical anomalies warm the midlatitudes and modify the vortex's vertical–meridional structure. Changes in stratospheric winds further regulate gravity-wave filtering, providing a pathway for SST signals to extend upward into the mesosphere. In contrast, negative events generally produce weaker and less statistically robust signals. These results identify Indian Ocean SST variability as an additional driver of large-scale atmospheric variability and reveal a previously underappreciated pathway through which the Indian Ocean can influence the middle and upper atmosphere at interannual timescales."

Gaston,Transported African Dust in the Lower Marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer is Internally Mixed with Sea Salt Contributing to Increased Hygroscopicity and a Lower Lidar Depolarization Ratio,"Coordinated observations from MAGPIE 2023 show that Saharan dust in the marine atmospheric boundary layer becomes internally mixed with sea spray. This mixing increases particle sphericity and hygroscopicity, likely leading to suppressed lidar linear depolarization ratios despite high dust concentrations. The findings have key implications for interpreting lidar-derived dust retrievals, estimating surface dust from satellite products, and improving dust representation in models. 
 Saharan dust is frequently transported across the Atlantic, yet the chemical, physical, and morphological transformations dust undergoes within the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) remain poorly understood. These transformations are critical for understanding dust's radiative and geochemical impacts, it's representation in atmospheric models, and detection via remote sensing. Here, we present coordinated observations from the Office of Naval Research's Moisture and Aerosol Gradients/Physics of Inversion Evolution (MAGPIE) August 2023 campaign at Ragged Point, Barbados. These include vertically resolved single-particle analyses, mass concentrations of dust and sea spray, and High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) retrievals. Single-particle data show that dust within the Saharan Air Layer (SAL) remains externally mixed, with a corresponding high HSRL-derived linear depolarization ratio (LDR) at 532 nm of ∼ 0.3. However, at lower altitudes, dust becomes internally mixed with sea spray, and under the high humidity (>80 %) of the MABL undergoes hygroscopic growth, yielding more spherical particles, suppressing the LDR to <0.1; even in the presence of high dust loadings (e.g., ∼ 120 µg m−3). This low depolarization in the MABL is likely due to a combination of the differences between the single scattering properties of dust and spherical particles, and the potential modification of the dust optical properties from an increased hygroscopicity of dust caused by the mixing with sea salt in the humid MABL. These results highlight the importance of the aerosol particle mixing state when interpreting LDR-derived dust retrievals and estimating surface dust concentrations in satellite products and atmospheric models."

The model matched many observed patterns but showed nighttime and background errors. We identified the main human and natural sources and sinks, offering insights to improve future greenhouse gas monitoring and climate modelling. 
 Understanding the variability and sources of atmospheric CO2 is essential for improving greenhouse gas monitoring and model performance. This study investigates temporal CO2 variability at the Xianghe site in China, which hosts both remote sensed (TCCON-affiliated) and in situ (PICARRO) observations. Using the Weather Research and Forecast model coupled with Chemistry, in its greenhouse gas option (WRF-GHG), we performed a one-year simulation of surface and column-averaged CO2 mole fractions, evaluated model performance and conducted sensitivity experiments to assess the influence of key model configuration choices. The model captured the temporal variability of column-averaged mole fraction of CO2 (XCO2) reasonably well (r=0.7), although a persistent bias in background values was found. A July 2019 heatwave case study further demonstrated the model’s ability to reproduce a synoptically driven anomaly. Near the surface, performance was good during afternoon hours (r=0.75, MBE =2.44 ppm), nighttime mole fractions were overestimated (MBE = 7.86 ppm), resulting in an exaggerated diurnal amplitude. Sensitivity tests revealed that land cover data, vertical emission profiles, and adjusted VPRM-parameters (Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model) can significantly influence modeled mole fractions, particularly at night. Tracer analysis identified industry and energy as dominant sources, while biospheric fluxes introduced seasonal variability – acting as a moderate sink in summer for XCO2 and a net source in most months near the surface. These findings demonstrate the utility of WRF-GHG for interpreting temporal patterns and sectoral contributions to CO2 variability at Xianghe, while emphasizing the importance of careful model configuration to ensure reliable simulations."

Focusing on six days with potential contrails over Europe, we show that these clouds cause daytime cooling and nighttime warming. Validation through various comparisons shows that our approach provides accurate estimates of contrail radiative forcing. 
 Contrails, anthropogenic ice clouds formed by aircraft at cruise altitudes, strongly influence the Earth’s radiation budget but the measurement of their radiative forcing (RF) remains poorly quantified at high temporal resolution. In this study, we present the Rapid Contrail-RF Estimation Approach, which uses geostationary satellite observations to estimate the radiative forcing of high-altitude ice clouds, including potential contrail cirrus clouds. Starting from a cloud retrieval product, we apply pre-computed Look-Up Tables (LUTs) to generate radiative forcing maps for high-altitude ice clouds. Specifically, observations from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) onboard Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) were used to visually identify days with potential contrails. For 6 selected days, ice clouds were characterized using the Optimal Cloud Analysis (OCA) product from MSG/SEVIRI data provided by the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT). The LUTs were constructed using the libRadtran radiative transfer model to quantify the radiative effect of ice clouds in the short-wave (SW) and long-wave (LW) spectral regions. A cloud top pressure filter was applied to isolate high-altitude ice clouds, including potential contrails. The resulting data set provides a quantification of SW, LW, and net radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere due to potential contrails. We show that these clouds contribute to daytime cooling and nighttime warming, with a net effect that varies between diurnal cycles. We assess the validity of the Rapid Contrail-RF Estimation Approach through correlation exercises focusing on uncertainties in the use of LUTs, a single ice cloud parameterization, and a calculated cloud top height, supplemented by comparisons with polar orbiting satellite observations from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments. In general, these correlative comparisons indicate that the proposed approach provides accurate data on the estimation of the radiative forcing of high-altitude ice clouds, including potential contrails, with an accuracy of approximately 15 %."

Observing a record convective  rainfall with national and local monitoring  networks and opportunistic sensors,"Extreme rainfall can cause severe damage, especially in cities. However, national meteorological institutes have difficulties to observe such events. In this study we show that rainfall observations collected by local actors, such as municipalities and even citizens, can contribute to better rainfall observations. Sweden’s official monitoring network could not capture the event under study, whereas the complementary sensors contributed to a better understanding of the magnitude of the event. 
 Short-duration extreme rainfall can cause severe impacts in built environments and flood mitigation measures require high-resolution rainfall data to be effective. It is a particular challenge to observe convective storms, which are expected to intensify with climate change. However, rainfall monitoring networks operated by national meteorological and hydrological services generally have limited ability to observe rainfall at sub-hourly and sub-kilometer scales. This paper investigates the capability of second- and third-party rainfall sensors to observe a highly localized convective storm that hit southwestern Sweden in August 2022. Specifically, we compared the observations from professional weather stations, C-band radar, X-band radar, Commercial Microwave Links and Personal Weather Stations to get a full impression of the sensors' strengths and weaknesses in the context of convective storms. The results suggest that second- and third-party networks can contribute important information on short-duration extreme rainfall to national weather services. The second-party network assisted in quantifying the magnitude and spatial variability of the event with high accuracy. The third-party network could contribute to the understanding of the duration and spatial distribution of the storm, but it underestimated the magnitude compared with the reference sensors."

Observations revealed clean conditions over the South Atlantic, with thin transported aerosol plumes from Southern Africa. Clouds were detected in 53 % of lidar profiles with higher occurrence in the first 2 km. The results show how combined lidar and photometer measurements can improve our understanding of aerosols in marine environment. 
 The TRANSAMA campaign (Transit to AMARYLLIS-AMAGAS oceanographic cruise), conducted aboard the research vessel Marion Dufresne II assessed instrument performance and investigated aerosol properties during its transit from La Reunion Island to Barbados (April–May 2023). A set of remote sensing instruments, including two CE318-T Sun-sky-lunar photometers and a CE370 single-wavelength elastic lidar, was deployed under the MAP-IO (Marion Dufresne Atmospheric Program–Indian Ocean) framework. Performance assessments of the deployed instrumentation support the development of coupled lidar–photometer systems for shipborne atmospheric observations, while acknowledging current detection limits. Synergistic observations provided vertically resolved aerosol properties, such as extinction coefficients, alongside atmospheric structure, highlighting the marine boundary layer (MBL) top at 800 ± 300 m. While the photometer observations revealed clean atmospheric conditions over the South Atlantic (AOD440=0.08±0.04), thin aerosol layers above the MBL were identified as long-range transported residual biomass-burning-urban aerosols from Southern Africa with effective LR of 33±12 sr. Cloud layers covering a large range of altitudes (up to 16 km) were observed in 53 % of the lidar profiles, with a higher frequency at lower altitudes, where aerosol layers were more frequently detected. These findings emphasize the impact of continental aerosols on remote oceanic regions and demonstrate the capabilities of synergistic lidar–photometer measurements for advancing our understanding of aerosol variability, cloud formation, and climate processes over the oceans."

Davis;Yue Jia,Validation of SNPP OMPS limb profiler version 2.6 ozone profile retrievals against correlative satellite and  ground based measurements,"The Montreal Protocol has led to a slow recovery in the Earth's ozone layer. To detect such changes, and to monitor the health of the ozone layer, long term global observations are needed. The OMPS Limb Profiler (LP) series of satellite sensors are designed to meet this need. We validate the latest version OMPS LP ozone profiles against other satellite and ground based measurements. We find that OMPS LP ozone is consistent with other data sources and is suitable for use in ozone trend studies. 
 The Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite Limb Profiler (OMPS LP) was launched onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite in 2011 and began routine science operations in April 2012. The OMPS LP uses measurements of scattered solar radiation in the ultraviolet, visible and near infrared wavelengths to retrieve high vertical resolution profiles of ozone from 12 km (or cloud tops) up to 57 km. In mid-2023, version 2.6 of the OMPS LP ozone profile retrievals was released, featuring improvements in calibration, retrieval algorithm, and data quality. We evaluate OMPS LP version 2.6 ozone retrievals using correlative data from other satellite instruments and ground based data for the period April 2012 to April 2024. Our results show agreement between OMPS LP and all correlative data sources between 20 and 50 km at all latitudes with differences of less than 10 %, with OMPS generally exhibiting a negative bias, except between 32 and 38 km in the tropics and southern mid-latitudes, where the bias is positive. In the tropics and southern mid-latitudes the differences between OMPS LP and MLS, and OMPS LP and SAGE III/ISS are less than ±5 % between 20 and 45 km. Above 50 km, the agreement with MLS is still on the order of −5 % or better. Larger positive biases, up to ∼ 35 %, are seen in the upper troposphere lower stratosphere layer (∼ 15 to 20 km) between approximately 40° S and 40° N. We find that OMPS version 2.6 ozone exhibits the same seasonal cycle as compared to all correlative measurement sources and our analysis shows that there is no significant seasonal bias in OMPS LP. We find drifts relative to correlative observations at all latitude bands of less than ±2 % per decade (±1 % per decade) between 25 and 50 km for the 2012–2024 period, with larger drifts above 50 km and below 20 km. These drifts vary between correlative measurements and straddle the zero line, we therefore conclude that there is no significant systematic drift in OMPS LP version 2.6 ozone for the period 2012 to 2024. The drift results represent an improvement in the long term stability of version 2.6 ozone over that of version 2.5."

We demonstrate PrecipBE's utilization with a brief 30-year trend analysis of ARM Southern Great Plains (SGP) site data, suggesting shorter, less intense events, but rising annual rainfall, driven by rare extremes. 
 Surface precipitation measurements are essential for Earth system model (ESM) evaluation and understanding cloud processes. An ever-growing need for robust, temporally evolving, and easy-to-use statistical datasets provides motivation for a baseline ground-based precipitation properties data product. The U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) user facility operates an extensive suite of precipitation instruments with various sensitivities and operating mechanisms, which render the decision of which instrument to use based on one or more fixed thresholds challenging and prone to errors and bias. Using a long-term instrument inter-comparison from a unique per-precipitation event perspective, rather than instantaneous sample comparison, we demonstrate that ARM rainfall-measuring instruments are generally consistent with each other at the statistical level. Inter-instrument deviations at the single event level can be large, especially for specific rainfall event properties such as maximum precipitation rates. A machine-learning (ML) analysis using a random forest regressor indicates that in some cases, depending on instrument, local site climatology, and/or specific deployment configuration, certain atmospheric state variables influence the measured quantities in an unpredictable manner. Thus, a-priori weighting of different instruments does not necessarily lead to more accurate and less biased synthesis of instrument data. These results motivate the design of the ARM precipitation best-estimate (PrecipBE) value-added product, which incorporates all valid precipitation data while considering data quality and other instrument limitations.PrecipBE consists of time series and tabular statistics datasets in an easy-to-use and insightful per-precipitation event format. It provides a large set of precipitation event properties supplemented with ancillary data from ARM datasets that correspond to the detected precipitation events. We describe the PrecipBE algorithm and demonstrate its use via the examination of a single-day output as well as a long-term trend analysis of precipitation events at the ARM Southern Great Plains (SGP) site, covering more than 30 years of data. The trend analysis tentatively suggests a long-term temporal tendency for mainly shorter and less intense precipitation events at the SGP site, but a long-term increase in annual rainfall by more than 36 mm (5 %) per decade. This rainfall trend is catalyzed primarily by more extreme event properties of relatively rare, intense precipitation events, with event total and 1 min maximum precipitation rate at a 1 year timeframe increasing up to 5 mm and 9 mm h−1 (several percent) per decade, respectively. While the currently available PrecipBE datasets (at https://adc.arm.gov/discovery/, last access:  8 December 2025) cover rainfall from multiple ARM deployments up to March 2025, PrecipBE is planned to be expanded to include solid-phase precipitation and will soon become an operational product with a several-day lag from real-time. We invite the ARM user community to leverage this new product and welcome user feedback to further enhance the dataset."

This method can identify the composition of these aerosols faster and more accurately. We tested it using ground-based data. Our results show that this method can help monitor air quality and better understand the impact of aerosols on the climate. 
 Accurate aerosol composition retrievals support radiative forcing assessment, source attribution, air quality analysis, and improved modeling of aerosol–cloud–radiation interactions. Aerosol retrievals based solely on visible-wavelength aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations provide limited spectral sensitivity, which may be insufficient to reliably distinguish among aerosol types with similar optical properties. In this study, we present a new retrieval framework that combines multi-wavelength AOD observations from both the visible and shortwave infrared spectrum, enhancing aerosol type discrimination. A neural network forward model trained on simulations from the Model for Optical Properties of Aerosols and Clouds (MOPSMAP), which relates aerosol optical properties to spectral AOD, is embedded in an optimal estimation method (OEM) to retrieve aerosol composition. This machine learning-based forward model achieves computational efficiency without making compromises in accuracy. The neural network forward model achieves a mean R2 of 0.99 with root-mean-square error below 0.01. The retrieval resolves up to four independent aerosol components, with degrees of freedom for signal about 3.75. We apply this hybrid method to ground-based observations, including data from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and Fourier Transform Infrared spectrometer (FTIR) measurements. The retrieved aerosol compositions are consistent with physical expectations and validated through backward trajectory analysis."

We used the MultiVI algorithm, which employs satellite images from various angles to enhance accuracy. Our method outperformed traditional statistical methods compared to field measurements, enabling precise large-scale mapping of vegetation cover for improved environmental monitoring and planning. 
 Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) is an important vegetation structure factor for applications in agriculture, forestry, ecology, etc. Due to its simplicity, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based mixture model is widely used to estimate FVC from remotely sensed data. However, the accuracy and efficiency of FVC estimation require the precise calculation of two key parameters: the NDVI of fully covered vegetation and bare soil. Despite their importance, these two endmember NDVI values have not yet been produced as large-scale maps. Traditional statistical methods for obtaining endmember NDVI from satellite datasets highly rely on the assumption that a certain amount of pure pixels of vegetation and soil must be present, which is often invalid for many areas. This study generated 30 m resolution maps of endmember NDVI across China using the MultiVI algorithm, incorporating multi-angle remote sensing data. The quality and accuracy of the endmember NDVI maps were evaluated using various validation data, including statistically obtained pure NDVI, soil spectra from a soil library, and field-measured FVC. The NDVI values for bare soil derived from the MultiVI algorithm were consistent with those obtained from the soil spectral library. Additionally, the FVC estimated using the MultiVI-derived endmember NDVI and the VI-based mixture model exhibited reasonable accuracy compared to the field measurements. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) values for MultiVI FVC were below 0.13 in the Heihe, Hebei, and Three Gorges Reservoir regions of China. These regions include typical arid and humid zones, facilitating the evaluation of the algorithm's performance under diverse climatic conditions. Furthermore, the MultiVI FVC outperformed those calculated using the traditional statistical methods. The endmember NDVI maps provide a convenient and reliable source of key parameters for the accurate and rapid estimation of FVC at large scales.

Shutler,Decadal and spatially complete global surface chlorophyll-a data record from satellite and BGC-Argo observations,"Chlorophyll a is routinely monitored using ocean colour satellites, however, these data records have gaps. Here we present a methodology to provide a spatially and temporally complete chlorophyll-a record, using Biogeochemical Argo floats as a constraint on wintertime chlorophyll-a, and a statistical kriging approach to fill cloud gaps. Thereby, providing a complete record at monthly 0.25° resolution between 1997 and 2024, consistent to the underlying climate data record. 
 Decadal-scale satellite-based climate data records of chlorophyll-a (chl-a), an essential climate variable, are now readily available at high accuracy and precision. These data are being extensively used for research and, increasingly, for operational services. However, these observations rely on availability of sunlight and the satellite sensor being able to view the ocean, so there are gaps in data due to the presence of clouds and more widely during the polar winter. This is an issue when spatially complete data are needed for global climate studies, or as inputs to machine learning methods and for data assimilation. Whilst addressing cloud cover is well studied, methodologies to overcome missing data due to the polar winter has received little attention and simple approaches to overcome these gaps can lead to unrealistic values. Biogeochemical Argo (BGC-Argo) floats have widely been deployed, and they represent an opportunity to address these gaps. We present an approach that combines BGC-Argo data and a satellite chl-a climate data record to produce a spatially and temporally complete, global monthly chl-a record between 1997–2024 at 0.25° spatial resolution. Clouds gaps were filled using an established spatial kriging approach. Polar wintertime chl-a were reconstructed using relative changes between the wintertime BGC-Argo chl-a, and the previous autumntime or next springtime satellite observations, for individual hemispheres. Uncertainties were calculated on a per-pixel basis to retain the underlying uncertainty fields in the climate data record and were modified to account for the uncertainties related to the gap filling. The seasonal cycles in the resulting polar data are consistent with light availability. Clear interannual and inter-hemisphere variability in the wintertime chl-a were observed. Independent assessment of solely the gap filled wintertime chl-a estimates against in situ data (N=201 total) indicates that the accuracy and precision of the underlying satellite data, a key component of a climate data record, are maintained. The 26 year global and spatially complete chl-a data, that are consistent with the underlying climate data record can be downloaded from Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15689006, Ford et al., 2025b)."

Due to complex physical and optical properties, BC remains poorly constrained. We combined satellite observations with physical models to build a daily, high-resolution, decadal global dataset of BC mass, number, size, and mixing details. The data contains both known sources and new hotspots. These results can support climate models, satellite products, and pollution mitigation. 
 Black carbon, a major absorbing component of atmospheric aerosols, plays an important role in climate regulation, air quality, and human health, yet its column concentration and microphysical properties at regional and global scales remains highly uncertain. In this study, we implement an integrated approach that combines multi-angle, multi-band observations from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) with a Mie scattering framework to estimate black carbon column properties including size and mixing state globally on a daily basis. By constraining particle size distributions with absorption aerosol optical depth and single scattering albedo across all four bands, the method simultaneously retrieves number and mass concentrations. Long-term simulations from 2005 to 2020 reveal distinct spatial and temporal patterns, with particularly high levels over biomass burning regions in Africa and South America as well as industrial and urban centers in Asia. Comparisons with ground-based sun photometer measurements and reanalysis data confirm the robustness and accuracy of the estimates. The resulting dataset provides a consistent global record of black carbon column concentrations, offering valuable support for constraining climate models, improving assessments of aerosol radiative forcing, and informing targeted mitigation strategies.

They impact the amount of solar energy entering the sea ice-ocean system. We describe the retrieval method of a new data set of the daily melt-pond coverage on Arctic sea ice north of 60 degrees latitude North for June to August of years 2000 to 2024 based on satellite remote sensing. The results of the quality assessment against independent observations demonstrate the data set’s credibility and usefulness for Arctic climate system studies. 
 We report on a novel data set of the melt-pond fraction on Arctic sea ice. Melt ponds on Arctic sea ice are an important phenomenon of the summer-melt process. They reduce the surface albedo of sea ice substantially, by that influence the net shortwave radiation balance, and with that the amount of solar radiation energy that is received by the sea ice-ocean system in the Arctic during summer. This has also implications for under-ice biogeochemical processes and ice mechanics. Melt ponds have been observed by a number of satellite sensors, mostly in the optical and near-infrared wavelength range. Here we present an updated version of a spectral un-mixing approach published earlier that led to a data set of melt-pond fraction on Arctic sea ice with 8-daily sampling for months May through August from 2000 through 2011. The approach is based on reflectance measurements of channels 1, 3 and 4 of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS on board the Earth Observation Satellite (EOS) Terra satellite. We modified the approach and derived the daily melt-pond fraction on Arctic sea ice at 500 m and at 12.5 km grid resolution for months June through August from 2000 through 2024 from MODIS v6.1 observations. In addition, we provide the net ice surface fraction – aka the fraction of sea ice without melt ponds – and the fraction of open water between the ice floes. Our MODIS melt-pond fraction agrees within -3 % to +4 % with independent estimates of the melt-pond fraction from very-high resolution optical satellite imagery and from Operation Ice Bridge Digital Camera System imagery. The MODIS open-water fraction we find to be too small by 2 % to 6 %; the net ice-surface fraction tends to be too large by 2 % to 9 %. The 12.5 km gridded product shows a slightly worse (by 1 %) agreement. While our 12.5 km gridded MODIS product under-estimates the melt-pond fraction from very-high resolution optical satellite imagery by about 2 % in the mean (median: 3 %), the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) product over-estimates these independent estimates by about 8 % (median: 9 %).

Using satellite images, we tracked when and how often rice was grown and confirmed the results with thousands of field samples. The maps closely match national statistics and offer a valuable resource for understanding food production, water use, and climate impacts in this vital region. 
 South and Southeast Asia, a major global hub for paddy rice cultivation, exhibits the highest rice cropping intensity worldwide due to its favourable hydrothermal conditions, and also has experienced considerable spatiotemporal changes due to climate change and anthropogenic activities. However, the absence of long-term spatial distribution and cropping intensity of paddy rice hinders effective agricultural and environmental management. This gap is particularly critical especially in the 21st century, with enhanced impacts from changing climate, water resources, and food trade pattern. Using all the available Landsat and Sentinel-2 archives, we refined a phenology-based algorithm to generate 30-m rice maps and cropping intensity across South and Southeast Asia for the years 1995, 2005, 2015, and 2024. The algorithm overcomes the challenge of detecting rice cropping intensity in long time-series and comprises three core steps: (1) identifying pixel-level rice phenological peaks using an enhanced peak detection method, thereby defining potential transplanting windows and minimizing monsoon-induced cloud and precipitation interference; (2) detecting paddy flooding signals and delineating rice cultivation areas based on phenological rules derived from the relationship between the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI); (3) determining rice cropping intensity according to the number of valid crop peaks and associated flooding signals within a single year. The resulting maps were validated using 23,396 samples collectively derived from a field photo library, visual interpretation of Sentinel-1/2 satellite imagery, and a sample migration algorithm. Across the four periods, the maps achieved overall accuracies ranging from 83 % to 87 %. In addition, the resultant products were compared with existing regional and period-specific rice datasets (e.g., NESEA-RICE10 and Open-SEA-Rice-10) for further evaluation. The comparisons demonstrated that the refined approach achieved higher accuracy and robustness in mapping both rice distribution and cropping intensity, whereas the existing products performed well only in partial environments. When compared with the FAO official statistics for South and mainland Southeast Asian countries, the derived maps yielded R² values exceeding 0.9. This dataset holds great potential for applications such as methane emission estimation, water resource management, and crop yield monitoring, thereby supporting sustainable agricultural practices and policy development in the region."

To better project their future evolution, we measured the ice thickness of the four glaciers using radio-echo sounding and mapped the bed topography beneath the ice. These maps provide essential insights into future landscapes, ecosystems, and policymaking. 
 Sweden currently hosts 270 glaciers, four of which belong to the 61 reference glaciers monitored worldwide. Eight Swedish glaciers disappeared during the warm summer of 2024, and under the global warming scenario associated with current climate policies, all four Swedish reference glaciers (Mårmaglaciären, Storglaciären, Rabots glaciär, and Riukojietna) are projected to vanish within this century. Such change will have implications for people, ecosystems, infrastructure, and local meteorological processes, highlighting the need to better constrain the resultant emerging post-glacial landscapes. During 2024–2025, we conducted radio-echo sounding (RES) surveys on the four Swedish reference glaciers and obtained a total of 40470 ice thickness point measurements. The mean and maximum measured ice thicknesses are 97 and 242 m for Mårmaglaciären, 88 and 225 m for Storglaciären, 85 and 158 m for Rabots glaciär, and 32 and 87 m for Riukojietna. The corresponding mean ice-thickness uncertainties are 12.0, 12.4, 11.4, and 7.5 m, respectively. The RES-measured ice thicknesses were used to produce high-resolution (10 m × 10 m) maps of ice thickness distribution and subglacial topography for each reference glacier, and to calculate their ice volumes as 0.32 (Mårmaglaciären), 0.25 (Storglaciären), 0.23 (Rabots glaciär), and 0.10 km3 (Riukojietna).

Here, we investigated the spatial variability and fluxes of two major aromatic DOM components, dissolved black carbon (DBC) and dissolved lignin phenols (DLP), in groundwater from a subtropical intertidal mangrove. Results showed significantly higher DBC and DLP concentrations in shallow groundwater than in deeper layers. The monomer ratios of DBC and DLP revealed distinct transformation patterns: more condensed DBC accumulated at depth, while DLP showed higher degradation in the recharge zone compared with the discharge zone. Hydrological factors such as hydroperiod and infiltration capacity dominated over geochemical factors (e.g., pH, dissolved oxygen, and salinity) in shaping DBC and DLP characteristics. Area-normalized fluxes of DBC (2.38 mg m–2 d–1, equivalent to 869.7 kg km–2 yr–1) and DLP (0.13 mg m–2 d–1, equivalent to 46.0 kg km–2 yr–1) via mangrove SGD significantly exceeded those from major global river systems, identifying intertidal mangroves as previously underappreciated sources of aromatic DOM to coastal waters. These findings expand our understanding of mangrove carbon cycling and highlight the need to incorporate SGD-derived aromatic DOM into the refinement of global carbon budgets."

In the present study, we report concentrations of total mercury (THg), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and 13 PFAS in the liver and muscle of Svalbard reindeer culled in August 2022 and October 2023. Seasonal differences were observed, with higher concentrations of THg, Cd, and several PFAS in October, likely reflecting an extended foraging time following the winter fasting. The PFAS profiles, dominated by PFOS and long-chain PFCAs, primarily suggest exposure to long-range transported contaminants rather than local sources, highlighting that even remote terrestrial wildlife is affected by emissions from industrialized regions. While Cd and Pb concentrations have decreased compared to levels reported in the 1980s, PFAS concentrations have increased over the past decade. These findings underscore the need for continued monitoring of Arctic terrestrial wildlife, particularly in the context of environmental change and remobilisation of legacy contaminants."

Microbial community analysis confirmed the establishment of the anammox-associated genus Candidatus Brocadia in A-VBS (1.2–2.2% relative abundance, along with a 4-fold increase in anammox 16S rRNA gene abundance), undetectable in C-VBS. 15N tracer assays showed that anammox contributed approximately 46.2% of N2 production in A-VBS. Quantitative modeling revealed co-occurrence and synergistic interactions among nitrification (amoA, nxrA), anammox (anammox 16S rRNA), and denitrification (narG, nirK, nirS, qnorB, nosZ) pathways in driving total nitrogen removal. These findings suggest the potential of anammox-integrated VBS as an effective, sustainable solution for enhanced nitrogen management in urban water systems."

Direct impacts involve the conversion of natural or vegetated land into impervious surfaces, whereas indirect impacts result from urbanization-induced changes in the climate, environmental conditions, and human activities. This study quantifies these direct and indirect effects across 360 Chinese cities using spatial statistical analyses and a random forest model along urban–rural gradients. Our findings show that indirect urbanization fosters vegetation growth (36.2%) and enhances carbon sinks (24.2%), with stronger effects in urban centers that decrease toward rural areas. Furthermore, 52.5% of the study grids demonstrated positive synergies between vegetation growth and carbon sinks, primarily driven by indirect urbanization factors, with significant influences from climatic and anthropogenic variables. Notably, indirect urbanization offsets approximately 38.5% of the carbon losses caused by impervious surface conversion. These results underscore the complex interplay between vegetation dynamics and urbanization, offering valuable insights for sustainable urban planning."

Here, we characterize the environmental and economic impacts of industrial organic loading reductions on centralized WRRFs via process modeling, life cycle assessment (LCA), and techno-economic analysis (TEA) under uncertainty. We demonstrate sustainability benefits of upstream organic carbon valorization will be amplified at WRRFs designed for BOD removal and nitrification but undermined at biological nutrient removal (BNR) or enhanced nutrient removal (ENR) WRRFs. Through uncertainty and sensitivity analyses, we find that operational cost changes at WRRFs following industrial load reduction are driven by unit electricity cost, solids disposal cost, and blower efficiency─along with external carbon addition in nutrient removal systems─while changes in GHG emissions are primarily driven by grid carbon intensity and fugitive methane emissions. A national spatial linkage of 4500 F&B facilities to their nearest WRRFs highlights regional clusters where industrial pretreatment could most improve WRRF sustainability."

Herein, we developed an automated approach integrating stable isotopic labeling with reactivity-directed principles. Normal and deuterated glutathione (GSH) probes were used to generate paired isotopic signatures enabling precise localization of reactive DBPs. Customized bioinformatics tools were employed to efficiently extract paired GSH–DBP adducts. The workflow allowed rapid automated processing of large data sets within minutes while maintaining high coverage and accuracy. When applied to chlorinated and chloraminated water samples, 255 adducts were screened from >50 000 raw features, leading to annotation of 202 DBPs, including 193 newly reported. GSH reaction mechanism analysis attributed 65 chlorinated and 132 unsaturated DBPs to nucleophilic substitution and addition, respectively. Notably, 5 sulfur-containing DBPs enabled thiol oxidation, indicating a new GSH reaction pathway. Among annotated DBPs, chlorination favored unsaturated carbonyls, while chloramination generated more nitrile/nitro group DBPs. Toxicity predictions verified that annotated DBPs exhibited toxicities comparable to or greater than those of regulated DBPs. Prevalent toxic DBPs exhibited a high molecular weight or structural characters, such as benzene rings, carbonyls, and Cl/N functionalization. This approach significantly accelerated toxic DBP discovery, and the findings provided new insights into toxicity drivers in disinfected waters."

To study this sustainability paradox, we evaluated associations between per capita GHG emissions and mortality across 76 major countries from 1990 to 2019 and projected future trends. GHG emissions and mortality data were from the Global Carbon Project and Global Burden of Disease 2021, respectively. We identified an N-shaped nonlinear association with inflection points at five and 15 tons per capita. Mortality initially decreased with rising emissions when below five tons per capita with reductions in communicable diseases, then increased by 15 tons per capita with increments in noncommunicable diseases, and eventually slightly declined beyond 15 tons. Health inequality worsened, with the concentration index falling from −0.812 (1990) to −0.882 (2019), indicating longer life expectancies in low emitters. Males and older adults faced a higher climate-related mortality risk, including cardiovascular death and extreme temperature-related injuries. Projections under a low-emission scenario indicated greater mortality reductions for low- and middle-income countries from 2025 to 2040, whereas high-income countries were expected to meet complex trade-offs. Our findings highlight the urgent need for context-specific decarbonization and climate justice policies to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals."

This study developed and parametrized a dynamic energy budget theory-based toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TKTD) model to assess the mortality of immature whitefly stages and the impacts of spidoxamat exposure on fecundity and fertility in adults. The TKTD model was integrated into an individual-based model (IBM) to predict population dynamics and efficacy under field conditions, validated with field trial data from different locations in India, Pakistan, and Brazil. The integrated model identified optimal application strategies across varying pest pressure and temperature regimes. The IBM simulation results indicate that a second application can substantially enhance population control, particularly when timed between 7 and 14 days postinitial treatment, depending on ambient temperature and population structure. This timing is influenced by the efficacy half-life and the developmental duration of immature stages, emphasizing the importance of precise application strategies in managing B. tabaci populations effectively. The findings underscore the importance of integrating empirical data with modeling for a mechanistic understanding of effects and the development of effective pest management strategies in the face of evolving agricultural challenges."

In plants, BPA is easily conjugated to form conjugates such as glycosyl BPA, and humans can be exposed to such conjugates when ingesting BPA-contaminated plant foods. This study considered the potential of deconjugation of glycosyl BPA in a simulated human gastrointestinal tract system and evaluated the subsequent changes in biological activity using the Caco-2 colon cell model. Glycosyl BPA was found in both soil and lettuce with concentrations ranging from not detected (ND) to 82.51 ng/g dry weight in edible plant tissues, and the level of glycosyl BPA was correlated significantly with that of BPA. Gastrointestinal digestion triggered progressive deglycosylation of glycosyl BPA with the deconjugation rate significantly higher in the intestinal phase (41.7–47.8%) than the gastric phase (13.4–23.3%). Deglycosylation of glycosyl BPA was associated with decreased Caco-2 cell activity and increased markers of oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in the cell. The re-released BPA may be key to the increased toxic effects. These findings highlight the underestimated health risks posed by plant-derived conjugated xenobiotics through transformation reactivation in the human digestive system."

Here, we report the application and validation of the first automatic microplastic pretreatment unit, Shimadzu’s MAP-100, designed to standardize this critical step. The unit was evaluated using river water spiked with aged standard microplastics for controlled testing and field-collected seawater for real-sample validation. After automatic pretreatment, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectral integrity was preserved, enabling reliable polymer identification and recovery rate determination. Detection of soluble organic matter demonstrated effective organic matter removal. Mineral particles were completely eliminated, with zero residual mineral detection. The MAP-100 achieved a higher recovery of aged microplastics (95.6 ± 2.5%) than manual pretreatment (92.7 ± 3.0%), with the greatest improvement observed for small (≤1 mm) and high-density particles. In seawater samples, overall performance remained robust; however, foam microplastics showed reduced recovery due to the overflow tube’s narrow diameter and sharp curvature, indicating a need for structural refinement. Despite this limitation, the closed-loop automatic workflow substantially reduces labor and processing time while improving reproducibility and operational safety for standardized microplastic monitoring."

However, current analytical strategies cause information loss when using aggregated features and are unable to establish comprehensive associations between single-cell metallomic data and health outcomes. We developed an analytical framework with more accurate characterization of multimetal distribution features, enabling the integration of single-cell metallomic data into health-related studies. We used quantiles to comprehensively extract the features of multimetals in spermatozoa population. Then, machine learning and factor analysis further consolidated key features into interpretable indices of multimetal co-occurrence characteristics. This framework addressed the conservation of the pseudobulk method and bias of the single-cell method, due to a more detailed characterization and appropriate integration of multimetal features at single-cell resolution. We showcase a negative association between multiple metals and sperm motility in the Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) model with a 10% increase in the collective features of 34 metals corresponding to a 3.3% reduction in sperm motility. Notably, the contribution of the multifaceted effects of lead and platinum suggests that dynamic changes in metal distribution may hold biological significance comparable to their total content. Finally, the generalizability of this analytical framework was validated with an additional single-cell metallomic data set. This method facilitates the application of single-cell metallomic measurement techniques in health effect studies, providing deeper insights for understanding the collective biological roles of metals in multicell organisms."

This study presents the first comprehensive assessment of traditional and emerging PFAS in the Amundsen Sea Polynya (ASP) during the austral summer (December 2023 to January 2024), integrating their occurrence in seawater and biological samples with key hydrographic and biogeochemical parameters. Short-chain compounds, such as perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), exhibited nearshore enrichment driven by atmospheric deposition followed by summertime meltwater release. Continuous sea-ice formation and brine rejection within the ASP further promoted the expulsion of PFBA with brine and its accumulation in the underlying Winter Water layer. In contrast, long-chain compounds, particularly 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid (6:2 FTSA), were preferentially incorporated into sea ice and advected toward the ASP margin─typically the marginal ice zone (MIZ)─by strong offshore winds. Their subsequent release during late-summer melting, coincident with elevated colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), resulted in enhanced 6:2 FTSA concentrations throughout the MIZ water column, possibly modulated by both microbial transformation and particle adsorption–settling processes. High bioaccumulation and biomagnification of 6:2 FTSA in Antarctic krill and Adélie penguins highlight its ecological risk to the Antarctic marine ecosystem. Furthermore, PFBA detection in Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) suggests potential interbasin transport via the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC), implying that global mid- and deep-ocean waters may serve as a long-term reservoir for PFAS."

However, NH4+ oxidation at bioanodes can result in substantial nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions─a potent greenhouse gas with significant climate impact. We investigated the potential of hydrogenotrophic denitrification within the anodic compartment to mitigate N2O emissions during NH4+ removal. In situ hydrogen (H2) addition effectively reduced N2O concentrations to below 0.01 mg of N/L, without nitrate or nitrite accumulation. Batch experiments demonstrated that the suspended biomass exhibited a high capacity for N2O reduction, which was strongly dependent on H2 availability and linked to denitrification activities. Integrating hydrogenotrophic denitrification with NH4+ oxidation in MECs presents a promising approach for sustainable nitrogen management with near-zero N2O emission."

Satellite-based instruments provide a way to independently monitor methane emissions from various sources at different scales, helping to assess the progress toward emission reduction targets. In this paper, we apply several data-driven methods to estimate methane emissions from the Secunda CTL (coal-to-liquids) synthetic fuel plant in South Africa, utilizing satellite observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) aboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) satellite and the GHGSat fleet of high-resolution commercial satellites. We find annual mean emissions of about 13–22 t/h based on S5P/TROPOMI observations. These results are consistent with estimates from an automated TROPOMI methane plume detection and quantification method. Estimates based on GHGSat observations from individual sources within the plant sum to about 6 t/h, on average. For comparison, Sasol, the operator of the Secunda CTL facility, reported methane emissions of 11.5 t/h for the period July 2023–June 2024, a value that falls between the TROPOMI- and GHGSat-based estimates. Our results highlight the value of satellite observations as a useful audit complementing reported emissions and demonstrate the importance of combining coarse- and fine-resolution data to monitor methane emissions at the plant and intrafacility level in complex sources."

To strengthen our knowledge of the drivers of plastic ingestion, we used two approaches: a systematic literature review and controlled experiments. Both approaches corroborated these factors as drivers of plastic ingestion, but despite these advances, studies are still needed that address holistic questions applicable to broader scenarios rather than focusing solely on taxon-specific traits or plastic characteristics in isolation from their ecological context. Additionally, a new driver has emerged─the social environment─which adds further complexity to how group formation may affect plastic ingestion across species."

In this paper we consider a simplified version of a LDAR program and demonstrate how to simulate the underlying system in an efficient manner, resulting in estimators of the quantities of interest that have a smaller variance than is possible using contemporary techniques. The proposed method relies on two ideas: the first is to leverage the underlying stochastic models to perform an event-driven simulation rather than a daily one; and the second is to use low-discrepancy sampling rather than plain random sampling to generate samples of potential scenarios for the underlying system, which results in a more systematic and balanced exploration of the scenario space. We show that in the context of a sensitivity analysis example, the proposed approach reduces the error of the estimates by factors of about 3 to 4 for the same computation time. This increased precision can provide conclusive statistical evidence that an LDAR program significantly reduces emissions compared to another, while the naive method’s error is often too large to draw any conclusion."

Fault cores formed by slow faulting exhibit much higher porosity and permeability compared to the surrounding damage zone and wall rocks, unlike those formed through brittle faulting. Since slow slip events associated with high pore fluid pressures are common in active tectonic regions, we propose that slow slip events can serve as a mechanism to maintain the permeable pathways beneath the seismogenic zone, facilitating the movement of mantle‐derived fluids from deep reservoirs toward the surface."

Despite a strong increase in regional VPD due to climate change, we find no significant trend in VPD on fire ignition days (VPDF). This discrepancy is due to a decreasing climatological mean (VPDF‐m), driven by the expansion of fires into higher‐latitude and higher‐altitude regions with climatologically lower VPD, and a relatively stable anomaly (VPDF‐a). The weak trend in this VPDF‐a is, in turn, a result of two opposing trends: a significant increase in the thermodynamic contribution from background warming, offset by a weakening of the dynamic contribution from circulation patterns. This lowering of the circulation “bar” for ignition, where less extreme weather is now sufficient to start large fires, explains the observed spatial expansion of fire risk, meaning regions historically less prone to fires now face heightened risk."

We attribute this to an overly strong simulation of Indonesian Throughflow, which suppresses the cooling effect of SMOC upwelling. Our results highlight the crucial role of SMOC in connecting the SST bias and subsurface thermal state in climate models and emphasize the need to constrain tropical IO air‐sea interactions for improving SST simulations."

Incorporating locally collected Eaton Fire endmembers into the library improves the accuracy by 1.3%. This demonstrates the feasibility of assessing structural damage from airborne imaging spectroscopy to rapidly inform post‐fire response and recovery efforts in WUI communities."

Besides the expected “too frequent, too light” precipitation biases in most models and reanalyses over the region, our study reveals other undocumented features such as notorious peak shifts and shape changes in the frequency distributions from 35°–50° to 50°–65° bands, which do not occur in satellite estimates. We also evaluated snowfall over mid to high latitudes and found that models have a substantial bias in frequency and intensity of snow days (>1 mm/day). The fraction of snow to total precipitation is substantially smaller for AMIP, but due to a rainfall overestimation rather than a deficit in snowfall. The intercomparison of the 7 precipitation data sets that employ remote‐sensing observations (including GPCPv3.2 and IMERGv7) is characterized by large uncertainties, which are additionally discussed. Using previous studies based on in situ data over the SO as well as CloudSat, we can also infer biases in most satellite data sets."

Among these, the quasi‐two‐day wave (QTDW) plays a prominent role in modulating MLT dynamics. In this study, we utilize more than 11 years (November 2013–March 2025) of Sri Venkateswara University (SVU) meteor radar observations made at a low‐latitude site (13.63°N, 79.4°E), SVU, Tirupati, India, to investigate the characteristics and impacts of the QTDW, as well as its contribution to momentum and heat transport in the MLT region, which remains poorly understood. The horizontal momentum flux (u′v′‾) $\overline{{u}^{\mathit{\prime }}{v}^{\mathit{\prime }}})$ zonal heat flux (u′T′‾ $\overline{{u}^{\mathit{\prime }}{T}^{\mathit{\prime }}}$), and meridional heat flux (v′T′)‾ $(\overline{{v}^{\mathit{\prime }}{T}^{\mathit{\prime }})}$ were analyzed using horizontal winds and the ambipolar diffusion coefficient (derived from meteor decay time). The ambipolar diffusion coefficient, which is directly related to the background temperature, was used for the heat flux estimation. The results reveal distinct seasonal and height‐dependent variations. In general, the horizontal momentum flux and zonal heat flux exhibited opposite trends relative to the background zonal mean wind during the solstices above 90 km ‐positive flux during the winter solstice and negative flux during the summer solstice. The meridional heat flux remained positive throughout, with enhanced values during the solstices and in October. This study is the first to quantify QTDW‐induced horizontal momentum and heat fluxes using meteor radar observations over a low‐latitude MLT region, providing new insights into wave‐mean flow interactions."

Here, an automated dynamic chamber system equipped with dual measurement chambers (MC1, MC2) was employed to measure HONO fluxes from wheat fields in the Huaihe River Basin, with alternating measurements of gas concentrations inside the chambers achieved via solenoid valve switching. Laboratory and field evaluations confirmed the feasibility of this flux measurement system. Two MCs were separated by 7 m, covering a wheat field at the seedling stage with low seedling coverage. The field results revealed similar diurnal variation patterns of HONO fluxes in MC1 and MC2, with higher fluxes observed at noon, and their mean values were 1.06 and 1.41 ng N m−2 s−1, respectively. Correlation analysis indicated that photosensitized conversion of NO2 on soil surfaces and microbial processes contribute comparably to HONO flux in the MC1, whereas microbial processes play a relatively more important role in the MC2. The higher inorganic nitrogen levels in the MC2 further suggest that enhanced nitrification may have increased HONO emissions. Further analysis showed that when the HONO flux difference between MC1 and MC2 is most significant, it may be caused by temperature‐induced variations in soil microbial processes, while the flux difference on some dates is likely associated with changes in NO2 × J(NO2). Our study provides the field evidence for understanding the spatial heterogeneity of HONO emissions from agricultural soils."

To clarify this critical issue, we approached the problem from two perspectives. First, it is found that the rupture of a sub‐100 μm bubble (diameter < 100 μm) generates only 3–4 jet drops. Second, as sub‐100 μm bubbles ascend, their size distributions would remain relatively unchanged. Based on the above results and model calculations, it is concluded that sub‐100 μm bubbles in the ocean are unlikely to be a dominant source of submicron sea spray aerosols. Moreover, the production rate of jet drops from sub‐100 μm bubbles decreases with increasing temperature, with no significant change in drop size. These findings would help elucidate the role of jet drop production in sea spay aerosols generation and material transfer through sea air interface."

We estimate the monetized health burden due to mortality caused by chronic PM2.5 exposure among adults living in the northern hemisphere, using a generalized concentration‐response function. The health impact sensitivities show large spatial variability over the northern hemisphere and exhibit a great deal of seasonal variability, especially for inorganic precursor emissions. The largest marginal impacts are seen for NH3 and primary PM2.5. The estimated health impacts for a 10% reduction in emissions reveal a hemispheric burden of 513,700 avoided mortality and monetized health benefits at above 1.2 trillion USD2016. The largest regional contribution to hemispheric mortality is found to be in East and South Asia, particularly China and India (183,760 and 123,440 for a 10% reduction in emissions, respectively). Monetized health burdens are estimated to be highest in China and Europe (∼365 and ∼252 million USD for a 10% reduction in emissions) while it is relatively similar in India (∼175 million USD) as in Canada and the United States (∼177 million USD). Sectoral source contribution analysis demonstrates that the agriculture (19%) and residential (15%) sectors are the largest contributors to the northern hemispheric scale health burden, however, regional differences exist in the results. Examining location‐ and sector‐specific health impacts can inform more effective regulatory measures."

 The Afar depression in northeastern Ethiopia contains a rich palaeontological and archaeological record, which documents 6 million years of human evolution. Abundant faunal evidence links evolutionary patterns with palaeoenvironmental change as a principal underlying force1. Many of the earlier hominin taxa recognized today are found in the Afar, but Paranthropus has been conspicuously absent from the region. Here we report on the discovery, in the Mille-Logya research area, of a partial mandible that we attribute to Paranthropus, dated to between 2.5 and 2.9 million years ago and found in a well-understood chronological and faunal context. The find is among the oldest fossils attributable to Paranthropus and indicates that this genus, from its earliest known appearance, had a greater geographic distribution than previously documented2. Often seen as a dietary specialist feeding on tough food, the range of diverse habitats with which eastern African Paranthropus can now be associated shows that this suggested adaptive niche did not restrict its ability to disperse as widely as species of Australopithecus and early Homo. The discovery of Paranthropus in the Afar emphasizes how little is known about hominin evolution in eastern Africa during the crucial period between 3 and 2.5 million years ago, when this genus and the Homo lineage presumably emerged. With its attribution to Paranthropus, a 2.6-million-year-old partial mandible expands the range of the genus into the Afar region of Ethiopia and adds to our understanding of hominin evolution in eastern Africa."

 The ability to construct entirely new synthetic DNA sequences de novo is essential to engineering and studying biology. However, the ability to produce long complex synthetic DNA sequences and libraries currently lags behind the ability to sequence and edit DNA1,2. All existing DNA-assembly technologies rely on DNA sequence information found within the final construct to direct assembly between DNA molecules3–11. As a result of this paradigm, these sequences cannot be extensively optimized specifically for assembly without affecting the final sequence. To fundamentally address this challenge, here we show the development of a new DNA assembly technique named Sidewinder that separates the information that guides assembly from the final assembled sequence using DNA three-way junctions. We demonstrate the transformative nature of the Sidewinder technique with highly robust and accurate construction of a 40-piece multifragment assembly, complex DNA sequences of both high GC content and high repeats, parallel assembly of multiple distinct genes in the same reaction and a combinatorial library with a large number of diversified positions across the entire length of the gene for high coverage of a library of 442,368 variants. This technology enables high-fidelity DNA assembly with a misconnection rate at the three-way junction of approximately 1 in 1,000,000.

 Refrigeration is indispensable to modern society1, yet the dominant vapour-compression systems rely on environmentally harmful fluorocarbon refrigerants with high global warming potential2–4. Solid-state caloric refrigeration offers a low-carbon alternative5–7, but its practical deployment has been hindered by limited cooling capacity and the inefficient indirect heat transfer that requires secondary fluids. Here we report an extreme barocaloric effect in NH4SCN aqueous solutions enabled by pressure-tuned dissolution and precipitation. This mechanism delivers an exceptionally large cooling capacity and markedly enhanced cooling efficiency. We obtain an in situ temperature drop of 26.8 K in the solution at room temperature, surpassing all known caloric materials. A Carnot-like cycle is designed to deliver 67 J g−1 cooling capacity per cycle with a second-law efficiency of 77%, benefiting from the extremely large temperature drops and direct heat transfer due to the self-circulating aqueous solution. Beyond the phase-transition scenario, this dissolution-based approach that combines the merits of current leading technologies emerges as a promising sustainable refrigeration solution.

 Physiological and pathological processes such as inflammation and cancer emerge from interactions between cells over time1. However, methods to follow cell populations over time within the native context of a human tissue are lacking because a biopsy offers only a single snapshot. Here we present one-shot tissue dynamics reconstruction (OSDR), an approach to estimate a dynamical model of cell populations based on a single tissue sample. OSDR uses spatial proteomics to learn how the composition of cellular neighbourhoods influences division rate, providing a dynamical model of cell population change over time. We apply OSDR to human breast cancer data2–4, and reconstruct two fixed points of fibroblasts and macrophage interactions5,6. These fixed points correspond to hot and cold fibrosis7, in agreement with co-culture experiments that measured these dynamics directly8. We then use OSDR to discover a pulse-generating excitable circuit of T and B cells in the tumour microenvironment, suggesting temporal flares of anticancer immune responses. Finally, we study longitudinal biopsies from a triple-negative breast cancer clinical trial3, in which OSDR predicts the collapse of the tumour cell population in responders but not in non-responders, based on early-treatment biopsies. OSDR can be applied to a wide range of spatial proteomics assays to enable analysis of tissue dynamics based on patient biopsies.

 The recent discovery of altermagnetism was in part motivated by the research of compensated magnets towards highly scalable spintronic technologies. Simultaneously, altermagnetism shares the anisotropic higher-partial-wave nature of ordering with unconventional superfluid phases, which have been at the forefront of research for the past several decades. These examples illustrate the interest in altermagnetism from a broad range of science and technology perspectives. Here we review the symmetry, microscopy and spectroscopy signatures of altermagnetism. We describe the spontaneously broken and retained symmetries that delineate altermagnetism as a distinct phase of matter with d-, g- or i-wave compensated collinear spin ordering. In materials ranging from weakly interacting metals to strongly correlated insulators, the microscopic crystal-structure realizations of the altermagnetic symmetries feature a characteristic ferroic order of anisotropic higher-partial-wave components of atomic-scale spin densities. These symmetry and microscopy signatures of altermagnetism are directly reflected in spin-dependent electronic spectra and responses. We review salient band-structure features originating from the altermagnetic ordering, and from its interplay with spin–orbit coupling and topological phenomena. Throughout, we compare altermagnetism with traditional ferromagnetism and Néel antiferromagnetism, and with magnetic phases with symmetry-protected compensated non-collinear spin orders. We accompany the theoretical discussions with references to relevant experiments.

 The mammalian cerebral cortex comprises a complex neuronal network that maintains a precise balance between excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. Accumulating evidence indicates that specific interneuron subtypes form stereotyped microcircuits with distinct pyramidal neuron classes1–3. Here we show that pyramidal neurons have an active role in this process by promoting the survival and terminal differentiation of their associated interneuron subtypes. In the wild-type cortex, interneuron subtype abundance mirrors the prevalence of their pyramidal neuron partners. In Fezf2 mutants, which lack L5b pyramidal neurons and are expanded in L6 intratelencephalic neurons, corresponding subtype-specific shifts occur through two distinct mechanisms: somatostatin interneurons adjust their programmed cell death, whereas parvalbumin interneurons switch their subtype identity. Silencing neuronal activity or blocking vesicular release in L5b pyramidal neurons revealed that their communication with interneurons does not require voltage-gated synaptic activity but engages both tetanus toxin-sensitive and tetanus toxin-insensitive pathways. Moreover, a targeted bioinformatic screen for ligand–receptor pairs displaying subtype-specific expression and reduced expression of pyramidal neuron-derived ligand in Fezf2 mutants identified candidate secreted factors and adhesion molecules. These findings reveal distinct, pyramidal neuron-driven mechanisms for sculpting interneuron diversity and integrating them into local cortical circuits.

 The Indonesian archipelago is host to some of the earliest known rock art in the world1–5. Previously, secure Pleistocene dates were reported for figurative cave art and stencils of human hands in two areas in Indonesia—the Maros-Pangkep karsts in the southwestern peninsula of the island of Sulawesi1,3–5 and the Sangkulirang-Mangkalihat region of eastern Kalimantan, Borneo2. Here we describe a series of early dated rock art motifs from the southeastern portion of Sulawesi. Among this assemblage of Pleistocene (and possibly more recent) motifs, laser-ablation U-series (LA-U-series) dating of calcite overlying a hand stencil from Liang Metanduno on Muna Island yielded a U-series date of 71.6 ± 3.8 thousand years ago (ka), providing a minimum-age constraint of 67.8 ka for the underlying motif. The Muna minimum (67.8 ± 3.8 ka) exceeds the published minimum for rock art in Maros-Pangkep by 16.6 thousand years (kyr) (ref. 5) and is 1.1 kyr greater than the published minimum for a hand stencil from Spain attributed to Neanderthals6, which until now represented the oldest demonstrated minimum-age constraint for cave art worldwide. Moreover, the presence of this extremely old art in Sulawesi suggests that the initial peopling of Sahul about 65 ka7 involved maritime journeys between Borneo and Papua, a region that remains poorly explored from an archaeological perspective. A hand stencil painted on a cave wall on a small island off the coast of Sulawesi more than 67,800 years ago suggests a very early occupation of Wallacea."

 Sub-Neptunes and super-Earths, the most abundant types of planet in the galaxy, are unlike anything in the Solar System, with radii between those of Earth and Neptune1,2. Fundamental questions remain regarding their structure and origin. Although super-Earths have a rocky composition3, sub-Neptunes form a distinct population at larger radii and are thought to consist of a rocky core overlain by a hydrogen-rich envelope4,5. At the extreme conditions of the core–envelope interface (exceeding several gigapascals and several thousand kelvin4,6), reaction between core and envelope seems possible, but the nature and extent of these reactions are unknown. Here we use first-principles molecular dynamics driven by density functional theory to show that silicate and hydrogen are completely miscible over a wide range of plausible core–envelope pressure–temperature conditions. We find the origin of miscibility in extensive chemical reaction between hydrogen and silicate, producing silane, SiO and water species, which may be observable with ongoing or future missions. Core–envelope miscibility profoundly affects the evolution of sub-Neptunes and super-Earths, by dissolving a large fraction of the hydrogen of the planet in the core and driving exchange of hydrogen between core and envelope as the planet evolves. First-principles molecular dynamics driven by density functional theory is used to show that silicate and hydrogen are completely miscible over a wide range of plausible core–envelope pressure–temperature conditions."

 Vertebrate vision is mainly accommodated by a pair of lateral image-forming camera-type eyes and is supplemented in non-mammalian vertebrates by a dorsal pineal complex (pineal and parapineal organs) functioning as photoreceptive and/or endocrine organs1. The pineal complex shares a common genetic and embryological basis with the lateral eyes, both derived from evaginations during the development of diencephalon2. Despite being widely heralded as the ‘third eye’ in crown vertebrates3, the nature of the pineal complex and its presumed visual capability in early vertebrates2 remain unknown. Here we describe two pigmented features situated between the lateral eyes in two species of myllokunmingids, the earliest known fossil vertebrates (approximately 518 million years ago), and interpret these as pineal/parapineal organs. In both myllokunmingid species, the pineal complex contains abundant melanin-containing melanosomes identical to those in the retinal pigment epithelium in the lateral eyes, together with a distinctive, regularly ovoid structure interpreted as a lens. Our results indicate that the lateral eyes and pineal complex in myllokunmingids probably functioned as camera-type eyes capable of image formation. Thus, we propose that the four camera-type eyes represent an ancestral vertebrate character, corroborating hypotheses about the deep homology between the eyes and pineal complex. Early vertebrates, particularly myllokunmingids, possessed four camera-type eyes (a pair of lateral eyes and pineal and parapineal organs), which indicates that these structures functioned in image formation, in support of the hypothesis that the four camera-type eyes represent an ancestral vertebrate trait."

 Cereblon (CRBN) is the target of thalidomide derivatives1 that achieve therapeutic efficacy against some haematologic neoplasias2–4 by recruiting neosubstrates for degradation5–7. Despite the intense investigation of orthosteric thalidomide derivatives, little is known about alternate binding sites on CRBN. Here we report an evolutionarily conserved cryptic allosteric binding site on CRBN. Small-molecule SB-405483 binds the allosteric site to cooperatively enhance the binding of orthosteric ligands and alter their neosubstrate degradation profiles. A survey of over 100 orthosteric ligands and their degradation targets reveals trends in the classes of compounds and neosubstrates in which degradation outcomes are enhanced or inhibited by SB-405483. Structural investigations provide a mechanistic basis for the effects of the allosteric ligand by shifting the conformational distribution of CRBNopen to a novel CRBNint and increasing the CRBNclosed state. The discovery of a cryptic allosteric binding site on CRBN that alters the functional effects of orthosteric ligands opens new directions with broad implications for improving the selectivity and efficacy of CRBN therapeutics. An allosteric site on the E3 ligase adapter cereblon can be targeted to modulate the efficacy of cereblon in targeted protein degradation applications."

Lightfoot,Predatory aggression evolved through adaptations to noradrenergic circuits,"Noradrenergic circuits support and balance aggressive behavioural states in predatory nematodes, distinguish predatory from non-predatory nematode species and are associated with the evolution of complex behavioural traits. 
 Behaviours are adaptive traits evolving through natural selection. Crucially, the genetic, molecular and neural modifications that shape behavioural innovations are poorly understood1. Here, we identify specialized adaptations linked to the evolution of invertebrate aggression2. Using the predatory nematode Pristionchus pacificus, we developed a machine learning model from behavioural tracking data and identified robust behavioural states associated with aggressive episodes. Strikingly, predatory aggression coincides with a rewiring of key circuits across nematode evolution. We find modifications to the noradrenergic pathway, with octopamine promoting aggressive predatory bouts whereas tyramine antagonistically induces passive states. Modulation occurs through the octopamine receptors Ppa-ser-3 and Ppa-ser-6, and tyramine receptor Ppa-lgc-55. These localize to sensory neurons whose inhibition diminishes aggressive events. Crucially, this octopaminergic innovation emerged within this predatory lineage, consistent with an ancient divergence in function. Thus, evolutionary adaptations in noradrenergic circuits facilitated the emergence of aggressive behavioural states associated with complex predatory traits. Noradrenergic circuits support and balance aggressive behavioural states in predatory nematodes, distinguish predatory from non-predatory nematode species and are associated with the evolution of complex behavioural traits."

 Earth’s early mantle probably existed as a deep, vigorously convecting magma ocean, and its solidification is considered central to the long-term chemical and dynamical evolution of the planet. Yet a notable uncertainty is the grain size of bridgmanite—the dominant lower-mantle phase—whose nucleation behaviour at extreme pressure has remained experimentally inaccessible. Here we show, using a combination of cutting-edge techniques, including large-scale molecular dynamics simulations consisting of up to 1 million atoms driven by machine learning potentials (MLPs), seeding and enhanced sampling, that crystal–melt interfacial energies of MgSiO3 bridgmanite increase substantially with pressure, surpassing those of silicate–liquid systems at ambient pressure by a factor of up to ten (refs. 1–3). In a deep basal magma ocean (BMO), this amplified interfacial energy, combined with the potential sluggish cooling, may permit the formation of unusually large bridgmanite crystals, up to centimetre-to-metre-scale sizes. Such potentially large crystals could drive efficient fractional crystallization and cause substantial chemical differentiation and mantle compaction. If operative, this mechanism would provide a new physical pathway linking lower-mantle material properties to early Earth stratification and it motivates future geodynamic models that explicitly incorporate supercooling, compositional convection and elemental partitioning. Our findings thus offer a plausible hypothesis connecting microscopic nucleation processes with macroscopic planetary structure, refining present views of how the Earth’s interior acquired its initial compositional architecture. Large-scale molecular dynamics simulations show that the crystal–melt interfacial energies of MgSiO3 bridgmanite increase substantially with pressure, potentially forming unusually large bridgmanite crystals and suggesting a new physical mechanism driving magma ocean segregation."

 Neurodegenerative diseases affect 1 in 12 people globally and remain incurable. Central to their pathogenesis is a loss of neuronal protein maintenance and the accumulation of protein aggregates with ageing1,2. Here we engineered bioorthogonal tools3 that enabled us to tag the nascent neuronal proteome and study its turnover with ageing, its propensity to aggregate and its interaction with microglia. We show that neuronal protein half-life approximately doubles on average between 4-month-old and 24-month-old mice, with the stability of individual proteins differing among brain regions. Furthermore, we describe the aged neuronal ‘aggregome’, which encompasses 1,726 proteins, nearly half of which show reduced degradation with age. The aggregome includes well-known proteins linked to diseases and numerous proteins previously not associated with neurodegeneration. Notably, we demonstrate that neuronal proteins accumulate in aged microglia, with 54% also displaying reduced degradation and/or aggregation with age. Among these proteins, synaptic proteins are highly enriched, which suggests that there is a cascade of events that emerge from impaired synaptic protein turnover and aggregation to the disposal of these proteins, possibly through microglial engulfment of synapses. These findings reveal the substantial loss of neuronal proteome maintenance with ageing, which could be causal for age-related synapse loss and cognitive decline. Newly developed mouse models that enable cell-specific analyses of proteostasis dynamics across the lifespan of the mice reveal key aspects of neuronal proteostasis with ageing."

 Neural tissues are exceptionally sensitive to oxygen deprivation and rely on a dense network of blood vessels to support their extraordinarily high metabolic demands for oxygen, nutrients and clearance of waste products1–4. In birds, one of the metabolically most demanding neural tissue—the retina—lacks internal blood vessels5,6. This raises the question of how such a metabolically demanding neural tissue can function without blood perfusion. Here we show that, while the photoreceptor outer segments in the outer retina have access to oxygen, the inner bird retina operates under chronic anoxia, supported by anaerobic glycolysis in the retinal neurons. We provide evidence that the pecten oculi—a uniquely vascularized structure in the vitreous humour of birds, the function of which has been debated for centuries5–9—supplies the anoxic inner retina with glucose and removes lactic acid. We suggest that the pecten’s metabolic support of the bird retina’s anoxia tolerance enabled first the evolution of a thick cell-dense, avascular retina, which secondarily served as an exaptation enabling retinal function during high-altitude migrations. While the photoreceptor outer segments in the bird outer retina have access to oxygen, the inner retina operates under chronic anoxia, supported by anaerobic glycolysis in the retinal neurons."

 Plasticity—the ability of cells to undergo phenotypic transitions—drives cancer progression and therapy resistance1–3. Recent studies have suggested that plasticity in solid tumours is concentrated in a minority subset of cancer cells4–6, yet functional studies examining this high-plasticity cell state (HPCS) in situ are lacking. Here we develop mouse models enabling the detection, longitudinal lineage tracing and ablation of the HPCS in autochthonous lung tumours in vivo. Lineage tracing reveals that the HPCS cells possess a high capacity for cell state transitions, giving rise to both early neoplastic (differentiated) and progressed lung cancer cell states in situ. Longitudinal lineage tracing using secreted luciferases reveals that HPCS-derived cells have a high capacity for growth compared with bulk cancer cells or another cancer cell state with features of differentiated lung epithelium. Ablation of HPCS cells in early neoplasias abrogates benign-to-malignant transition, whereas ablation in established tumours by suicide gene or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells robustly reduces tumour burden. We further demonstrate that the HPCS gives rise to therapy-resistant cell states, whereas HPCS ablation suppresses resistance to chemotherapy and oncoprotein-targeted therapy. Notably, an HPCS-like state is ubiquitous in regenerating epithelia and in carcinomas of multiple other tissues, revealing a convergence of plasticity programs. Our work establishes the HPCS as a critical hub enabling reciprocal transitions between cancer cell states. Targeting the HPCS in lung cancer and in other carcinomas may suppress cancer progression and eradicate treatment resistance. The high-plasticity cell state (HPCS) is a critical hub that enables reciprocal transitions between cancer cell states, and targeting the HPCS may suppress cancer progression and eradicate treatment resistance."

 At every scale they occupy, magnetic fields affect various phenomena, including star formation, cosmic-ray transport, charged-particle acceleration, space weather, transport in planetary atmospheres and laboratory plasmas. These fields are often generated and sustained by turbulent flows in a process called the dynamo. In 1955, E. N. Parker parameterized the effects of small-scale turbulence to propose a mean-field dynamo theory1. The widely used theory reproduces observed large-scale fields but suffers from difficulty in tuning parameters as they are not justified from first principles: studies of turbulent flows show tangled magnetic fields, which are folded and fragmented into small-scale structures owing to shear-flow straining2,3. Here, considering a shear flow that is unstable and driven, we develop analytic theory and perform three-dimensional, advanced computer simulations of turbulence with up to 4,096 × 4,096 × 8,192 grid points, showing ab initio generation of quasi-periodic, large-scale magnetic fields. The generation occurs via the mean-vorticity effect—an additional mean-field dynamo process postulated4 in 1990. Crucial to this dynamo is the prior generation of large-scale three-dimensional jets, robustly produced as topologically protected and exact nonlinear solutions of the magnetohydrodynamic equations. The jet-driven dynamo applies to shear-driven laboratory and astrophysical systems. These include binary neutron star mergers5,6, where the reported dynamo probably operates on microsecond timescales to produce in milliseconds some of the strongest magnetic fields in the Universe7, providing signals for multi-messenger astronomy8.

 The leading cause of human pregnancy loss is aneuploidy, often tracing to errors in chromosome segregation during female meiosis1,2. Although abnormal crossover recombination is known to confer risk for aneuploidy3,4, limited data have hindered understanding of the potential shared genetic basis of these key molecular phenotypes. To address this gap, we performed retrospective analysis of pre-implantation genetic testing data from 139,416 in vitro fertilized embryos from 22,850 sets of biological parents. By tracing transmission of haplotypes, we identified 3,809,412 crossovers, as well as 92,485 aneuploid chromosomes. Counts of crossovers were lower in aneuploid versus euploid embryos, consistent with their role in chromosome pairing and segregation. Our analyses further revealed that a common haplotype spanning the meiotic cohesin SMC1B is associated significantly with both crossover count and maternal meiotic aneuploidy, with evidence supporting a non-coding cis-regulatory mechanism. Transcriptome- and phenome-wide association tests also implicated variation in the synaptonemal complex component C14orf39 and crossover-regulating ubiquitin ligases CCNB1IP1 and RNF212 in meiotic aneuploidy risk. More broadly, variants associated with aneuploidy often showed secondary associations with recombination, and several also exhibited associations with reproductive ageing traits. Our findings highlight the dual role of recombination in generating genetic diversity, while ensuring meiotic fidelity.

Pollen,Dissecting gene regulatory networks governing human cortical cell fate,"Systematic screening of transcription factors reveals conserved mechanisms governing cortical radial glia lineage progression across primates and provides a framework for functional dissection of gene regulatory networks in human cortical neurogenesis. 
 Human cortical neurogenesis involves conserved and specialized developmental processes during a restricted window of prenatal development. Radial glia (RG) neural stem cells shape cortical cell diversity by giving rise to excitatory neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, as well as olfactory bulb interneurons (INs) and a recently characterized population of cortical INs1,2. Complex genetic programs orchestrated by transcription factor (TF) circuits govern the balance between self-renewal and differentiation, and between different cell fates3–8. Despite progress in measuring gene regulatory network activity during human cortical development9–12, functional studies are required to evaluate the roles of TFs and effector genes in human RG lineage progression. Here we establish a human primary culture system that allows sensitive discrimination of cell fate dynamics and apply single-cell CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screening13,14 to examine the transcriptional and cell fate consequences of 44 TFs active during cortical neurogenesis. We identified several TFs with new roles in cortical neurogenesis, including ZNF219—previously uncharacterized—that represses neural differentiation and NR2E1 and ARX that have opposing roles in regulating RG lineage plasticity and progression across developmental stages. We also detected convergent effector genes downstream of multiple TFs enriched in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders and observed conserved mechanisms of RG lineage plasticity across primates. We further uncovered a post-mitotic role for ARX in safeguarding IN subtype specification through repressing LMO1. Our study provides a framework for dissecting regulatory networks driving cell fate consequences during human neurogenesis.

 Sensing technologies that exploit quantum phenomena for measurement are finding increasing applications across materials, physical and biological sciences1–7. Until recently, biological candidates for quantum sensors were limited to in vitro systems, had poor sensitivity and were prone to light-induced degradation. These limitations impeded practical biotechnological applications, and high-throughput study that would facilitate their engineering and optimization. We recently developed a class of magneto-sensitive fluorescent proteins including MagLOV, which overcomes many of these challenges8. Here we show that through directed evolution, it is possible to engineer these proteins to alter the properties of their response to magnetic fields and radio frequencies. We find that MagLOV exhibits optically detected magnetic resonance in living bacterial cells at room temperature, at sufficiently high signal-to-noise for single-cell detection. These effects are explained through the radical-pair mechanism, which involves the protein backbone and a bound flavin cofactor. Using optically detected magnetic resonance and fluorescence magnetic-field effects, we explore a range of applications, including spatial localization of fluorescence signals using gradient fields (that is, magnetic resonance imaging using a genetically encoded probe), sensing of the molecular microenvironment, multiplexing of bio-imaging and lock-in detection, mitigating typical biological imaging challenges such as light scattering and autofluorescence. Taken together, our results represent a suite of sensing modalities for engineered biological systems, based on and designed around understanding the quantum-mechanical properties of magneto-sensitive fluorescent proteins.

 Membrane transport proteins translocate diverse cargos, ranging from small sugars to entire proteins, across cellular membranes1–3. A few structurally distinct protein families have been described that account for most of the known membrane transport processes4–6. However, many membrane proteins with predicted transporter functions remain uncharacterized. Here we determined the structure of Escherichia coli LetAB, a phospholipid transporter involved in outer membrane integrity, and found that LetA adopts a distinct architecture that is structurally and evolutionarily unrelated to known transporter families. LetA localizes to the inner membrane, where it is poised to load lipids into its binding partner, LetB, a mammalian cell entry (MCE) protein that forms an approximately 225 Å long tunnel for lipid transport across the cell envelope. Unexpectedly, the LetA transmembrane domains adopt a fold that is evolutionarily related to the eukaryotic tetraspanin family of membrane proteins, including transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs) and claudins. Through a combination of deep mutational scanning, molecular dynamics simulations, AlphaFold-predicted alternative states and functional studies, we present a model for how the LetA-like family of membrane transporters facilitates the transport of lipids across the bacterial cell envelope.

 The quantum superposition principle is a fundamental concept of physics1 and the basis of numerous quantum technologies2,3. Yet, it is still often regarded counterintuitive because we do not observe its key features on the macroscopic scales of our daily lives. It is, therefore, interesting to ask how quantum properties persist or change as we increase the size and complexity of objects4. A model test for this question can be realized by matter-wave interferometry, in which the motion of individual massive particles becomes delocalized and needs to be described by a wave function that spans regions far larger than the particle itself5. Over the years, this has been explored with a series of objects of increasing mass and complexity6–9 and a growing community aims at pushing this to ever larger limits. Here we present an experimental platform that extends matter-wave interference to large metal clusters, a qualitatively new material class for quantum experiments. We specifically demonstrate quantum interference of sodium nanoparticles, which can each contain more than 7,000 atoms at masses greater than 170,000 Da. They propagate in a Schrödinger cat state with a macroscopicity10 of μ = 15.5, surpassing previous experiments5,9,11 by an order of magnitude. Quantum interference of sodium nanoparticles, which can each contain more than 7,000 atoms at masses greater than 170,000 Da, is demonstrated."

Thornalley,Relatively warm deep-water formation persisted in the Last Glacial Maximum,"During the Last Glacial Maximum, the deep Northwest Atlantic was only about 2 °C colder than today, suggesting sustained production of relatively warm North Atlantic Deep Water during the Last Glacial Maximum. 
 The Last Glacial Maximum (19–23 thousand years ago) was characterized by low greenhouse gas concentrations and continental ice sheets that covered large parts of North America and Europe1. Glacial climate was therefore very different, with colder global mean temperatures and an increased Equator-to-pole temperature gradient, probably resulting in stronger westerlies2. However, the state of the deep North Atlantic Ocean under these glacial climate forcings remains uncertain3–6, particularly owing to the rarity of deep-ocean temperature and salinity constraints. Here we show that the temperature of the glacial deep (>1.5 km) Northwest Atlantic was approximately 0–2 °C (only 1.8 ± 0.5 °C (2 s.e.) colder than today), and, after accounting for the whole-ocean change, seawater δ18O was 0.3 ± 0.1‰ (2 s.e.) higher and can be traced back to the surface subtropics via the subpolar Northeast Atlantic and Nordic Seas. Together, our hydrographic data reveal the thermal and isotopic structure of the deep Northwest Atlantic and suggest sustained production of relatively warm and probably salty North Atlantic Deep Water during the Last Glacial Maximum. Furthermore, our results provide updated constraints for benchmarking Earth system models used to project future climate change. During the Last Glacial Maximum, the deep Northwest Atlantic was only about 2 °C colder than today, suggesting sustained production of relatively warm North Atlantic Deep Water during the Last Glacial Maximum."

 The early infant microbiome is largely primed by microbial transmission from the mother between birth and the first few weeks of life1–3, but how interpersonal transmission further shapes the developing microbiome in the first year remains unexplored. Here we report a metagenomic survey to model microbiome transmission in the nursery setting among babies attending the first year, their educators and their families (n = 134 individuals). We performed dense longitudinal microbiome sampling (n = 1,013 faecal samples) during the first year of nursery and tracked microbial strain transmission within and between nursery groups across 3 different facilities. We detected extensive baby-to-baby microbiome transmission within nursery groups even after only 1 month of nursery attendance, with nursery-acquired strains accounting for a proportion of the infant gut microbiome comparable to that from family by the end of the first term. Baby-to-baby transmission continued to grow over the nursery year, in an increasingly intricate transmission network with single strains spreading in some classes, and with multiple baby-acquisition and species-transmissibility patterns. Having siblings was associated with higher microbiome diversity and reduced strain acquisition from nursery peers, while antibiotic treatment was the condition that most accounted for the increased influx of strains. This study shows that microbiome transmission between babies is extensive during the first year of nursery, and points to social interactions in infancy as crucial drivers of infant microbiome development.

 Fibre electronic devices are transforming traditional fibres and garments into new-generation wearables that can actively interact with human bodies and the environment to shape future life1–5. Fibre electronic devices have achieved almost all of the desired functions, such as powering6,7, sensing8,9 and display10,11 functions. However, viable information-processing fibres, which lie at the heart of building intelligent interactive fibre systems similar to any electronic product, remain the missing piece of the puzzle12–15. Here we fill this gap by creating a fibre integrated circuit (FIC) with unprecedented microdevice density and multimodal processing capacity. The integration density reaches 100,000 transistors per centimetre, which effectively satisfies the requirements for interactive fibre systems. The FICs can not only process digital and analogue signals similar to typical commercial arithmetic chips but also achieve high-recognition-accuracy neural computing similar to that of the state-of-the-art in-memory image processors. The FICs are stable under harsh service conditions that bulky and planar counterparts have difficulty withstanding, such as repeated bending and abrasion for 10,000 cycles, stretching to 30%, twisting at an angle of 180° cm−1 and even crushing by a container truck weighing 15.6 tons. The realization of FICs enables closed-loop systems in a single fibre, without the need for any external rigid and bulky information processors. We demonstrate that this fully flexible fibre system paves the way for the interaction pattern desired in many cutting-edge applications, for example, brain–computer interfaces, smart textiles and virtual-reality wearables. This work presents new insights that can promote the development of fibre devices towards intelligent systems. Fibre integrated circuits created by first preparing circuitry on extremely thin and flexible substrates and then mechanically rolling them up demonstrate microdevice density reaching 100,000 transistors per centimetre and excellent stability under harsh service conditions."

 The movement of dendritic cells and T cells within secondary lymphoid organs is critical for the development of adaptive immune responses1,2. Central to this process is the fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC) network, which forms a highly organized conduit system that facilitates the movement of and interactions between dendritic cells and T cells3–6. Previous studies have partly characterized how FRCs support these interactions7,8. However, the molecular mechanisms that operate under physiological conditions remain unknown. Here we show that the viral protein m11, encoded by the herpesvirus murine cytomegalovirus (CMV), inhibits antiviral immunity by targeting the FRC network and interfering with a critical function of cellular CD44. We found that m11 binds to CD44 and established that m11 perturbs the molecular interactions of CD44 with its natural ligand, hyaluronic acid. The interaction of m11 with CD44 impairs the trafficking of dendritic cells within the spleen, thereby impeding efficient priming of naive T cells and the initiation of antiviral CD8 T cell responses. The targeting of CD44 by CMV reveals CD44 as a molecule that is essential to the functioning of the FRC network and uncovers a previously unrecognized stroma-based mechanism that is critical for the generation of effective T cell responses. CD44 expressed by fibroblastic reticular cells in secondary lymphoid organs regulates trafficking of dendritic cells, and thus has an essential role in the priming of T cells and the adaptive immune response."

 Schizophrenia and related psychoses occur in all human populations, with the highest rates of diagnosis among Black individuals and those of mainly African ancestry1. Decades of research have established a highly heritable and polygenic basis for schizophrenia, which is mostly shared across populations2–4. However, a recruitment bias towards European cohorts5 has led to discoveries that are poorly generalizable to African populations. This exclusion of the world’s most genetically diverse populations narrows our understanding of disease biology and risks exacerbating health disparities. Here we show that electronic health records linked with genomic data from the Million Veteran Program (MVP)6—a national research programme that looks at the effects of genes, lifestyle, military experiences and exposures on the health and wellness of veterans—enable a comprehensive assessment of schizophrenia genetics in populations of African ancestry in the USA. We identify ancestry-independent associations in African populations and expand the catalogue of implicated regions by more than 100 loci. Through statistical fine-mapping and integrative transcriptomic analyses, we refine disease-associated signals to consensus genes with convergent neurobiological functions. These findings provide a much-needed view of schizophrenia’s genetic architecture in populations of African ancestry, and offer biological insights that both extend previous work and broaden its global relevance. Genome-wide association studies incorporating data for populations of African ancestry provide an expanded view of the genetic basis of schizophrenia, which has previously been studied mainly in European and East Asian cohorts."

 Crystalline silicates form at high temperatures (>900 K) (refs. 1,2). Their presence in comets3–6 suggests that high-temperature dust processing occurred in the early Solar System and was subsequently transported outwards to comet-forming regions. However, direct evidence for this crystallization and redistribution in Sun-like protostars has remained unknown. By comparing James Webb Space Telescope mid-infrared spectra of the periodically bursting protostar EC 53 (ref. 7), we detect crystalline silicate (forsterite and enstatite) emission features that appear only during the burst. The emergence of these features indicates active crystal formation by thermal annealing in the hot inner disk during the accretion burst. We also detect a nested outflow—a collimated atomic jet enclosed by slower molecular outflows, consistent with magnetohydrodynamic wind models8. This configuration provides a mechanism for the outward transport of freshly crystallized silicates9. To our knowledge, our results provide the first direct observational evidence of in situ silicate crystallization during episodic accretion bursts in a very young star still embedded in its dense envelope. Although we do not directly detect grains transported to the outer disk, the observed trends are consistent with outward redistribution, indicating that both dust processing and transport occur during the earliest and most dynamic stages of star formation. The detection of forsterite and enstatite emissions in EC 53 during accretion bursts marks one of the first pieces of direct evidence of in situ silicate crystallization in young stars."

 The vertebrate central nervous system is protected by the blood–brain barrier and meningeal membranes, which ensure immune privilege1. In the mammalian brain, microglia and barrier-associated or border-associated macrophages (BAMs) provide immune surveillance and scavenge wastes2, yet how evolution shaped immune-cell diversity and function is not understood. In zebrafish, a vascular-derived mural lymphatic endothelial cell (muLEC) lineage fulfils scavenger cell functions at central nervous system borders3–5. Here we identify the transcription factor odd-skipped related 2 (osr2) as a specific marker and regulator of muLEC differentiation and maintenance. osr2 controls the transition of muLECs from interconnected endothelial cells to individual scavenger cells in part by means of control of cadherin-6. muLECs are more transcriptionally similar to BAMs than to other mammalian meningeal cells and share several functions in tissue homeostasis. However, BAMs are absent from zebrafish and muLECs from mice and humans. Analysis of osr2, lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) and BAM markers in diverse vertebrate species reveals muLECs as an ancient lineage and BAMs a recent mammalian specialization. muLECs and BAMs share functional analogies but are not homologous, providing an example of convergent evolution. This highlights the physiological importance of meningeal scavenger cells and the developmental plasticity of LECs in generating specialized cell types throughout evolution.

 Microplastics (MPs) are global pollutants1, yet their atmospheric distribution is poorly understood2. Although atmospheric MP measurements have become more abundant, estimates of emissions into the atmosphere vary by orders of magnitude3,4. Here we compile a global atmospheric MPs dataset and compare it with size-aligned MP model simulations. Our model simulations show two to four orders of magnitude overestimation of the measured global median atmospheric MP concentrations. Measured median concentrations over the ocean are 27 times lower than over the land (0.003 and 0.08 particles m−3, respectively). Applying a simple scaling method, we estimate that oceanic emissions are lower in number than land-based emissions. The total global land-based and oceanic emissions are 6.1 × 1017 (1.3 × 1017 to 1.1 × 1018) particles year−1 and 2.6 × 1016 (2.7 × 1015 to 5.0 × 1016) particles year−1, respectively. Our results indicate that fewer MP particles are emitted into the atmosphere than previously thought. Land sources dominate the number but not the mass emissions, indicating that MPs emission size distributions should be investigated further.

 Tissue-resident macrophages (RTMs) form during embryogenesis, self-renew locally, and regulate tissue homeostasis by clearing dead cells and debris1–6. During tissue damage, however, bone-marrow-derived monocytes enter tissues and differentiate into RTMs, repairing the tissue and replenishing macrophages in the niche1. The universal cell-intrinsic mechanisms that control the monocyte-to-RTM transition and the maintenance of mature RTMs across tissues remain elusive3. Here we show that deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS), an enzyme that mediates spermidine-dependent hypusine modification of translation factor eIF5A5,7, is required for RTM differentiation and maintenance. Mice with myeloid cell lack of DHPS (Dhps-ΔM mice) had a global defect in RTMs across tissues, resulting in persistent but ultimately futile monocyte influx. Transcriptional analyses of DHPS-deficient macrophages indicated a block in their ability to differentiate into mature RTMs, whereas proteomics revealed defects in cell adhesion and signalling pathways. Sequencing of ribosome-engaged transcripts identified a subset of mRNAs involved in cell adhesion and signalling that rely on DHPS for efficient translation. Imaging of DHPS-deficient macrophages in tissues showed differences in morphology and tissue interactions, which were correlated with their failed RTM differentiation. DHPS-deficient macrophages were also defective in critical homeostatic RTM functions including efferocytosis and tissue maintenance. Together, our results demonstrate a cell-intrinsic, tissue-agnostic pathway that drives differentiation of monocyte-derived macrophages into RTMs. In mice, DHPS supports the maturation, maintenance and function of tissue-resident macrophages via the polyamine–hypusine axis, with implications for macrophage-targeting therapies."

 The psychedelic psilocybin may have lasting therapeutic effects for patients with chronic pain syndromes. Some preclinical data suggest these putative benefits derive from direct analgesic effects; however, this possibility has not been comprehensively tested in preclinical models. Here, we evaluated the analgesic properties of a single exposure to psilocybin at acute and chronic time points in Complete Freund’s Adjuvant-induced inflammatory pain, spared nerve injury model of neuropathic pain, and acid-induced muscle pain. Across these models, we tested a range of doses (0.3, 2, and 10 mg/kg i.p.) in male and female mice using multiple behavioral assays evaluating sensory aspects (von Frey, cold plate, Hargreaves, thermal place preference, and muscle withdrawal threshold) and functional aspects of pain (marble burying). We further tested the effects of psilocybin on the affective dimension of pain in a surgical model of acute pain (mouse grimace scale). Except for cold sensitivity, we found no effect of psilocybin across pain models, behavioral assays, drug doses, or sex. The apparent reduction in cold sensitivity may be explained by profound hypothermia induced by psilocybin rather than true analgesia.

Here, the authors synthesise a family of hybrid metal halide glasses, and show that the molecular shape and polarity determine rotational disorder, enabling diverse glass-forming abilities. 
 The critical progression of structural disorder, which governs the bulk glass-forming ability (GFA), can be elucidated as an ergodicity-breaking process. Understanding the atomic characteristics involved is imperative for establishing advanced glass design principles. However, conventional glasses present significant challenges due to their inherently complex and ambiguous disorder motifs, such as intricate and random atomic clusters or ring distributions. In this work, we synthesize a family of zero-dimensional hybrid metal halides with tunable short- to medium-range structural arrangements to form glasses with diverse GFAs. Through altering molecular shape and surface electrostatic potential of organic cations, their rotational order is able to be broken in a controlled manner. This leads to distinct phase space partitions of molecular movements, allowing for tunable GFAs. Our findings provide a fundamental design approach for synthesizing property-oriented glasses by controlling molecular rotational order, which can be applicable to a wide range of molecular glasses and amorphous solids.

 Organic molecular crystals with controllable bending angles are crucial interconnectors in integrated optoelectronic chips, which can precisely guide optical signals along a predetermined path to achieve effective optical path steering. Nevertheless, current methods of tailoring molecular crystals with desired bent geometric features yet without fractured bending interface has not yet been fully realized. Here, we addresses this issue by proposing a universal “molecular cocrystal” strategy that introduces directional charge-transfer non-covalent interactions into molecular systems to weaken the original interactions, thereby triggering the spontaneous deformation transition from crystal slippage to bending. Significantly, a diverse range of self-assembled bent crystals with accurate angles ranging from 61.8° to 85.0° have been synthesized without destroying the structural integrity of the crystals. The proposed strategy is also applied to construct hierarchical bent microstructures with 2 to 6 bends. These as-prepared bent crystals exhibit excitation position-dependent anisotropic optical behaviors, which are applied into the photonics switch with adjustable on/off ratio. This methodology offers a versatile pathway to purposely design bent crystals with tailored angles, thereby laying a structural foundation for the on-chip organic optoelectronics.

Here, authors show spatiotemporal gene-expression maps across neuronal types revealing ligand receptor interactions that support migration and circuit formation. 
 The cerebral cortex comprises diverse excitatory and inhibitory neuron subtypes, each with distinct laminar positions and connectivity patterns. Yet, the molecular logic underlying their precise wiring remains poorly understood. To identify ligand–receptor (LR) interactions involved in cortical circuit assembly, we tracked gene expression dynamics in mice across major neuronal populations at 17 developmental stages using single-cell transcriptomics. This generated a comprehensive atlas of LR-mediated communication between excitatory and inhibitory neuron subtypes, capturing known and novel interactions. Notably, we identified NEOGENIN-1 as the principal receptor for CBLN4 during the perinatal period, mediating synapse formation between somatostatin-expressing interneurons and glutamatergic neurons. We also identified members of the cadherin superfamily as candidate regulators of perisomatic inhibition from parvalbumin-expressing basket cells onto deep and superficial excitatory neurons, exerting opposing effects on synapse formation. These findings suggest a context-dependent role for cadherins in synaptic specificity and underscore the power of single-cell transcriptomics for decoding the molecular mechanisms of cortical wiring.

 T cells contribute to immune protection and pathogenesis in tuberculosis, but measurements of polyclonal responses have failed to resolve correlates of outcome. We report the temporal evaluation of the human in vivo clonal repertoire of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-reactive T cell responses, by T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing at the site of the tuberculin skin test, as a model for a standardised antigenic challenge. Initial non-selective recruitment of T cells is followed by enrichment of Mtb-reactive clones arising from oligoclonal T cell proliferation. We introduce a modular computational pipeline, Metaclonotypist, to sensitively cluster distinct TCRs with shared epitope specificity, which we apply here to establish a catalogue of public Mtb-reactive HLA-restricted T cell metaclones. Although most in vivo Mtb-reactive T cells are private, 10 metaclones were sufficient to identify Mtb-T cell reactivity across our study population (N≥128), indicating striking population level immunodominance of specific TCR-peptide interactions that may inform patient stratification and vaccine development.

 Ultra-long-acting (ULA) antiretroviral parenteral formulations, with low injection volumes, high resistance barriers, and short pharmacokinetic (PK) tails, can transform HIV-1 therapeutics. Here, we converted bictegravir (BIC), a potent daily oral antiretroviral drug, into monomeric and homodimeric ester prodrugs. The homodimeric prodrug nanosuspension, NMXBIC, shows sustained plasma BIC levels > 16 times the protein-adjusted 95% inhibitory concentration (PA-IC95) for six months after a single injection in Sprague Dawley rats. The results paralleled a short PK tail with the potential for late dose forgiveness. The monomeric prodrug nanosuspension, NM2BIC, shows lower year-long plasma BIC concentrations above PA-IC95 after a single injection. After repeated injections, NMXBIC and NM2BIC are well tolerated in New Zealand White rabbits. NMXBIC’s physicochemical properties and high BIC loading/unit mass of the prodrug contribute to its unique ULA PK profile. These results support its development as a ULA formulation for HIV-1 treatment and prevention.

 Elevated sugar intake has been linked to poor cardiovascular health, but the effects of early-life sugar restriction on the lifelong risk of heart failure remain unclear. Using the end of sugar rationing in the United Kingdom in 1953 as a natural experiment, we classify participants in the UK Biobank by birth timing to define early-life exposure to sugar rationing. Here we show that individuals exposed to early-life sugar rationing exhibit an approximately 14% lower risk of heart failure and develop the condition about 2.6 years later than those unexposed. Longer exposure is associated with stronger effects, and population-level estimates suggest that around 4–5% of heart failure cases may be attributable to the absence of early-life sugar restriction. Genetic susceptibility does not modify these associations but acts additively. These findings underscore the long-term importance of early-life sugar exposure for heart failure, and further studies are warranted.

McBride;Lichun Tang;Zifeng Yu;Klaus Fraedrich,Do rapidly and non-rapidly intensifying tropical cyclones represent two different dynamical regimes,"Do rapidly and non-rapidly intensifying tropical cyclones represent two different dynamical regimes 
 Rapid intensification (RI) of tropical cyclones (TCs) poses a major challenge in intensity forecasting and is a key contributor to the observed bimodal distribution of cyclone peak intensities. However, it remains unclear whether RI represents a distinct dynamical process. Here, we use lag plot (phase space) analysis from nonlinear dynamical systems theory to examine the underlying dynamics of RI and non-RI cyclones. Case studies of Typhoon Yagi (RI) and Typhoon Bebinca (non-RI) that made landfall in southern China in September 2024, combined with statistical analyses of a global cyclone dataset (1990–2021), reveal systematic differences in phase trajectories and correlations between lifetime maximum intensity (LMI) and intensification time. Our findings suggest that RI is not merely an amplification of normal intensification but represents a distinct dynamical regime, characterised by a transient intensification process, rather than the approximately steady intensity growth of the non-RI cyclones. A simple trend-persistence model is used as a dynamical diagnostic to examine error growth in the two regimes."

 Magma reservoir organization is hidden from view but important to systematic understanding of active volcanoes and intrusive igneous rocks. Seismic anisotropy in active silicic reservoirs suggests horizontally elongated melt sheets or sills, but it remains unclear if shallow silicic reservoirs in low strain rate settings without recent recharge maintain similar organization. Here we present new 3-D seismic tomography of the upper crustal reservoir beneath the tectonically quiescent Valles Caldera using dense nodal arrays. Results reveal >15% radial anisotropy consistent with up to 17-24% melt in horizontally elongated volumes interspersed with melt-poor layers, despite net crystallization since about 0.5 Ma and little contemporary strain. Structural similarity of Valles Caldera to more dynamic modern systems indicates that intrinsic reservoir processes like iterative magma injection, crystal settling, and melt compaction organize long-lived horizontally-layered structure, largely independent of tectonic setting and recharge rate.

 The Moon is depleted in moderately volatile elements compared with Earth, likely due to high-temperature processes during its formation. How this depletion evolved and the role of later surface processes remain unclear. Here we report high-precision zinc isotope measurements of basalt fragments and soils collected by the Chang’e-5 (CE-5) mission from a ~ 2-billion-year-old volcanic region. The basalts have zinc isotope values similar to those of Apollo mare basalts, consistent with global volatile loss during the Moon-forming impact. In contrast, soils show lighter zinc isotope signatures than Apollo soils and no variation with depth, suggesting little effect from space weathering. Instead, the data indicate that low-temperature volcanic outgassing deposited isotopically light zinc on the surface. These results show that young lunar soils can retain evidence of late-stage volcanic degassing, distinct from the intense volatile loss that shaped the early Moon.

 Obliquely rifted continental margins are common, yet oblique spreading ridge segments are surprisingly rare. Oblique oceanisation, as seen in the southeast Indian Ocean, the Central Gulf of Aden, and the Equatorial Atlantic, invariably evolved into orthogonal ridge segments connected by transform faults. It remains unclear why the orthogonal ridge-transform configuration is preferred, and how it develops under sustained oblique divergence. Using 3D thermomechanical numeric models, we show that slow/ultraslow oblique spreading inherited from oblique rifting is a dynamic process. It enhances asymmetric oceanic plate growth with alternating directions and spontaneously self-organizes into orthogonal ridge segments connected with transform faults. The offset and spacing of the oceanic transform faults are controlled by the obliquity angle and the spreading rate. The step-wise orthogonal ridge-transform pattern is favored because it minimizes the total length of stronger ridge segments relative to weaker transforms, thereby reducing the mechanical work required for plate separation. Oblique spreading at slow to ultraslow rates fosters asymmetric growth of the ocean floor and leads to spontaneous formation of orthogonal ridge segments and new transform faults, according to thermomechanical simulations."

 How Stonehenge’s building blocks arrived on Salisbury Plain remains debated, with glacial and human transport mechanisms proposed. Here we test the possibility of Pleistocene glacial sediment input using grain-scale U–Pb fingerprinting of detrital zircon and apatite from modern stream sediments surrounding Stonehenge.

Salisbury Plain detrital zircon ages match those of southern British rocks sourced from the London Basin, implying local sediment recycling rather than glaciogenic transport. Apatite ages of ~60 Ma reflect post-depositional U–Pb resetting, consistent with the distal effects of the Alpine orogeny.

 Seagrasses play a vital role in coastal ecosystems, providing habitat, stabilising sediments, and contributing to carbon sequestration. However, global warming has increased the frequency and intensity of heatwaves, posing a significant threat to seagrass health. This study investigates the effects of marine and atmospheric heatwaves on the spectral reflectance of the intertidal seagrass Zostera noltii. Laboratory experiments were conducted under controlled heatwave conditions, where hyperspectral reflectance measurements were taken to assess the impacts over time. Simulated heatwave conditions caused a substantial decline in seagrass reflectance, particularly in the green and near-infrared regions, corresponding to the darkening of green leaves. Key vegetation indices, including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Green Leaf Index (GLI), showed pronounced reductions under heatwave stress, with NDVI values decreasing by up to 34% and GLI by 57%. A novel metric, the Seagrass Heat Shock Index (SHSI), was developed to quantify the transition of seagrass leaves from green to brown, demonstrating a stronger ability to capture the effects of heatwave exposure on seagrass colouration. Multispectral satellite observations corroborated the laboratory results, revealing widespread darkening of seagrass leaves during marine and atmospheric heatwave events in South Brittany, France. Notably, darkened seagrass patches were observed in intertidal areas exposed to air temperatures exceeding 32 °C for over 13.5 h per day. These findings highlight the potential of spectral reflectance as a tool for detecting early signs of heatwave-induced stress in seagrasses, offering a valuable method for remote sensing-based habitat assessment. The present study underscores the potential of remote sensing to capture rapid environmental changes in intertidal zones, enabling for continuous monitoring of seagrass meadows under the current and future climate regimes."

 Accurate pan-sharpening of multispectral images is essential for high-resolution remote sensing, yet supervised methods are limited by the need for paired training data and poor generalization. Existing unsupervised approaches often neglect the physical consistency between degradation and fusion and lack sufficient constraints, resulting in suboptimal performance in complex scenarios. We propose RevFus, a novel two-stage pan-sharpening framework. In the first stage, an invertible neural network models the degradation process and reverses it for fusion with cycle-consistency self-learning, ensuring a physically grounded mapping. In the second stage, structural detail compensation and spatial–spectral contrastive learning alleviate detail loss and enhance spectral–spatial fidelity. To further understand the network’s decision-making, we design a quantitative and systematic measure of model interpretability, the Interpretability Efficacy Coefficient (IEC). IEC integrates multiple statistics derived from SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values into a single unified score and try to evaluate how effectively a model balances spatial detail enhancement with spectral preservation. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that RevFus outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and traditional methods, delivering superior spectral fidelity, enhanced spatial detail, and high model interpretability, thereby validating the effectiveness of the interpretable deep learning framework for robust, high-quality pan-sharpening."

 Obtaining accurate geometric positioning information for images is crucial for the application of remote sensing images in stereo mapping, map production, and target positioning. However, for optical remote sensing satellite images and archived historical images, the geometric positioning methods vary, and different control data formats are needed. This limits the timeliness of applying optical remote sensing images and has become a bottleneck for the unified and standardized processing of such images. In response, this paper presents a framework for optimizing the geometric positioning accuracy of optical remote sensing images. A lightweight vector control library (LVCL) is constructed to serve as the control data for the geometric positions of the optical images, and a rough positioning method based on a mutual feedback constraint-matching strategy and multiple associated images is proposed to obtain approximate positions of the target images quickly. Moreover, optimal iteration and segmented connection based vector matching methods are proposed to accurately match the target image to images in the LVCL, thereby providing the target image’s geographical information based on the control data. Experiments conducted across multiple regions show that this framework can effectively match remote sensing images with the geographic coordinates in the LVCL: the data storage volume is only 1/10 to 1/3893 of that of traditional and existing lightweight methods, demonstrating prominent lightweight advantages; among the images from 13 cities, the correct rough positioning matching results for 12 cities rank among the top 10, with 7 achieving the first place; the number of vector construction nodes in 62 regions is better than that of the comparison strategy; the vector matching results are correct and the number of matching points is the largest; for the 13 regions, the average positioning deviation decreases from 156.590 m to 4.098 m, and the maximum deviation decreases from 582.142 m to 10.588 m, with systematic errors significantly corrected. Thus, the proposed framework is expected to become a new paradigm for obtaining the geometric positions of optical remote sensing images."

 Mitigating pollutants and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is a core strategic imperative for China, necessitating integrated technological solutions. Satellite remote sensing (SRS) has emerged as a pivotal tool for environmental monitoring, enhancing our understanding of pollutants and GHG emissions from space and supports policy-making. Here we summarize the recent research advances regarding the role of SRS in monitoring pollutants and GHG emissions in China, focusing on three key applications: 1) pollutant emission tracking, 2) carbon emission quantification, and 3) synergistic monitoring of pollution-carbon interactions. Current analysis identifies substantial progress achieved over the past decades, but critical limitations remain. From a scientific perspective, both ground observation networks and professional sensors are lacking for improving retrieval accuracy. Moreover, artificial intelligence (AI)-based data-mining theory is inadequate. From a practical perspective, high-resolution satellite provides insufficient coverage for nationwide carbon monitoring and data deficiencies hinders intelligent monitoring systems. To address these challenges, we provide the following strategic priorities: 1) establishing integrated Space-Air-Ground observation systems, 2) accelerating the deployment of next-generation monitoring satellites and developing related retrieval algorithms, and 3) developing AI-based monitoring systems through multisource data integration. This review enhances the understanding of SRS applications and provides directions for future research aimed at mitigating pollutant and GHG emissions, thereby supporting China’s dual carbon goals and sustainable development worldwide."

 Rapid decline in lung function is a key phenotype of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is associated with disease progression and a poor prognosis. However, time-specific dynamics of pollutant exposure and their impacts on this phenotype remain unclear. In this retrospective cohort study, we investigated how period-specific particulate matter (PM) exposure relates to lung function rapid decline in individuals with COPD. Clinical and individual factors and ambient PM exposures were collected, and participants were categorized into rapid-decline and non-rapid-decline groups based on forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) trajectories. A modified exponentially weighted moving average approach was used for estimating PM2.5 and PM10 exposure levels across the baseline, early follow-up, and late follow-up periods. Regression and machine learning models assessed period-specific effects, with variable importance evaluated via Shapley additive explanation. The rapid-decline group had significantly higher baseline lung function but greater annual FEV1 reductions than the non-rapid-decline group (both p < 0.01). After adjusting for confounding factors, PM exposures were associated with FEV1 declines (PM2.5: −280.62 to −267.38 mL/year; PM10: −305.15 to −246.89 mL/year, all p < 0.01) and increased odds ratio of rapid FEV1 decline (PM2.5: 1.76–1.95; PM10: 1.62–1.96, all p < 0.05), particularly evident in models emphasizing the baseline and late follow-up periods. Baseline PM2.5 and PM10 exposures, and age were identified as the most influential predictors. These findings suggest that period-specific PM exposure may critically contribute to the development of lung function rapid decline in COPD. Considering environmental, temporal, and individual-level factors may help improve disease management."

 To examine decadal changes in aerosol pollution, trends, hotspots, and aerosol types across the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), north-east India (NEI), and the Himalayas, a 25-year (2000–2024) analysis was conducted using MODIS and MERRA-2 datasets. The highest aerosol loading and trend (MODIS AOD) occurred over the lower IGP (0.71 ± 0.09; 0.016 yr−1), followed by the middle IGP (0.65 ± 0.10; 0.009 yr−1), upper IGP (0.51 ± 0.10; 0.003 yr−1), and NEI (0.40 ± 0.10; 0.008 yr−1). Within the Himalayas, the central region showed the highest AOD (0.24 ± 0.09) with low trends (0.001–0.003 yr−1). Significant rising trends were observed in SO42−AOD over the lower IGP (0.006 yr−1) and OCAOD over NEI (0.004 yr−1). AOD across the entire IGP and NEI increased by more than 20 % in the 2010s relative to the 2000s. Notably, SO42−AOD increased by ∼30–40 % over the lower IGP, while OCAOD rose by over 50 % in NEI and the eastern Himalayas, with an additional 30–40 % rise during 2020–2024. Bangladesh, the lower IGP, and NEI consistently emerged as hotspots of carbonaceous and sulphate aerosols, shifting into highly polluted zones after 2020. The upper and middle IGP for the western and central Himalayas and NEI and the lower IGP acted as major source regions. Clean-continental and biomass/urban aerosols dominated the Himalayas, whereas anthropogenic aerosols prevailed over the IGP and NEI, with notable increases across the Himalayas after 2020.

 Indoor dust (ID) is a key indicator of indoor air quality, reflecting both human activity and the infiltration of outdoor pollutants. This study integrates magnetic, geochemical, and microscopic methods to identify pollution sources by characterizing magnetic particles (MPs) in ID collected from residential locations in the Warsaw metropolitan area. Fine (<0.071 mm) and coarse (0.071–1.0 mm) dust fractions were analyzed alongside road dust (RD) and wood ash to differentiate between indoor and outdoor contributions. Magnetite was identified as the primary magnetic mineral, accompanied by metallic Fe and/or iron-based alloys. Decomposition of isothermal remanent magnetization acquisition curves revealed two main coercivity components in ID, while RD and ash exhibited distinct magnetic signatures. Scanning electron microscopy identified technogenic MPs, such as ferrospheres and abrasion-derived flakes, while geochemical analyses highlighted associations between Fe and heavy metals (e.g., Zn, Pb). Cluster analysis indicated both anthropogenic (traffic, biomass combustion, industry) and natural (soil, crustal) origins. Based on these findings, potentially toxic metals were correlated with their likely sources: sulfur from coal burning; zinc, copper, and lead from vehicle emissions; calcium from construction activities; and chromium from indoor sources such as chrome-plated surfaces. Variations in dust composition among apartments—especially in the fine fraction mass and magnetic properties—underscore the influence of ventilation, proximity to traffic, and resident behavior. This study confirms that magnetic methods provide a nondestructive, cost-effective approach for tracking external pollutants in ID and underscores their potential as a screening tool for assessing urban environmental health risks."

 Reliable near–surface air temperature (Ta) over the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is critical for energy balance closure, cryosphere assessment, and land–atmosphere modeling, yet complex relief and sparse gauges challenge gridded fields. We build a daily, lineage-spanning benchmark across 20 research-grade stations to evaluate five representative datasets—global land reanalysis, observation-conditioned regional fusions, and recent kilometer-scale, observation-based interpolations—under a unified collocation. Performance is stratified by eco-climatic zone (HI/HII), ground-thermal state (permafrost/seasonally frozen), and 500-m elevation bands. Observation-conditioned fields outperform the purely model-driven ERA5-Land reanalysis at the daily scale; the reanalysis shows a pervasive cold bias, strongest in HII winter. Elevation composites indicate rising R2 and shrinking MAE from 3.0 to 4.5 km, with winter weakest seasonally. A lightweight two-stage correction—regime-aware height normalization (γ) followed by quantile mapping—cuts MAE by 0.5–2.0 °C and removes height-dependent cold bias. A unitless usability matrix translates multi-metric skill into scene-specific guidance by season–zone–elevation, offering an operational pathway to select and minimally correct TP Ta forcings transferable to other high-relief regions."

 This article provides a comprehensive overview of the spatiotemporal variation, chemical characteristics, and source identification of PM2.5 in the coastal and island regions of East Asia. We aimed to comprehensively ascertain the mass concentration and chemical signature of PM2.5 in these distinctive maritime environments. To begin with, the inter-comparison of PM2.5's sampling and analytical methods applied by previous researches were extensively employed. The spatial distribution of PM2.5's mass concentrations and chemical composition were explored throughout the coasts and islands in East Asia. Coastal regions commonly exhibited considerably higher PM2.5 concentrations (152.40 ± 51.20 μg/m3 in North China to 8.34 ± 4.60 μg/m3 in South Taiwan) than those at the island sites (63.08 ± 39.04 μg/m3 in Bohai Sea to 8.82 ± 4.09 μg/m3 in Western Pacific Ocean) with the distinct chemical fingerprints of PM2.5 originated from continental and maritime sources, respectively. The source identification of PM2.5 in the coastal and island regions clarify their distinct chemical characteristics and dominant sources. Coastal regions were predominantly influenced by industrial emissions, vehicular exhausts, and shipping activities, whereas island regions showed greater contributions from long-range transport, oceanic spray, and ship emissions. This article further investigated three major influential factors specifically affecting PM2.5 levels in coastal regions and at islands of East Asia, including pollution sources, weather patterns, and transporting pathways. The study identified three distinct transport channels, namely the West, East, and South Channels which exhibited markedly different PM2.5 levels: the West Channel (38.65 ± 17.07 μg/m3), East Channel (11.28 ± 5.11 μg/m3), and South Channel (9.16 ± 2.71 μg/m3). Anthropogenic sources were the major contributors to PM2.5, while weather patterns and meteorological phenomena also played essential roles in shaping its spatiotemporal variation in East Asia. Moreover, this article further addressed the cluster of transport pathways in assessing three transport channels of PM2.5. By synthesizing the findings from previous investigations, it provided a comprehensive understanding of PM2.5 pollution dynamics in the coastal regions and at the islands of East Asia.

Boopathy,A genome-wide genetic screen reveals the P2Y2-integrin axis as a stabilizer of EGFR mutants in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),"Activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene drive non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Oncogenic EGFR mutants are ligand-independent and more stable, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We hypothesized that EGFR mutants selectively leverage cellular stabilizers to evade degradation. Genome-wide RNA interference screens identified genes (encoding for stabilizers) responsible for mutant EGFR stability, with P2Y2 receptor (P2Y2) emerging as a bona fide stabilizer. Mechanistically, high extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels transactivate EGFR mutants via P2Y2 activation, previously shown to signal through Src kinase–dependent EGFR phosphorylation. Our study reveals that ATP-driven P2Y2 activation stabilizes EGFR mutants by forming a P2Y2-integrin β1-EGFR complex enriched in endosomes. Targeting this axis destabilizes EGFR mutants and offers a strategy against drug resistance. Elevated P2Y2 and integrin β1 expression in patients with NSCLC implies clinical relevance. Our results provide previously unidentified insight that EGFR mutants enhance extracellular ATP levels to activate P2Y2-integrin for enhanced stability of EGFR mutants to drive the oncogenic program."

Olson,Slowing planetary rotation influences ocean nutrient cycling and oxygenation,"Marine habitability for complex life on Earth and Earth-like planets requires bioavailable nutrients and dissolved oxygen. The cycling of nutrients and oxygen is controlled by physical ocean circulation. However, our understanding of how circulation has varied through time and space is incomplete for Earth and unconstrained for Earth-like exoplanets. Earth’s rotation has slowed over time, affecting ocean circulation by modifying the Coriolis effect. We use a three-dimensional Earth system model to explore how slowing planetary rotation influences ocean circulation and biogeochemistry. We show that slower rotation enhances wind-driven upwelling and global circulation. Nutrient recycling is consequently more efficient, increasing photosynthetic productivity. Additionally, enhanced ocean oxygenation improves habitability for aerobic life under a well-oxygenated atmosphere. However, under a poorly oxygenated atmosphere, slowing rotation increases oxygen fluxes from the ocean to the atmosphere. Therefore, Earth’s rotational history may have been a long-term background control on surface oxygenation and the evolution of animals."

Peelen,Dynamic context–based updating of object representations in the visual cortex,"Objects in real-world scenes are often poorly or partially visible, for example because they are occluded or appear in the periphery. An additional challenge of real-world vision is that it is dynamic, causing the appearance of objects (e.g., their size and orientation) to change as we move. Notably, however, these changes are predictable from the three-dimensional structure of the surrounding scene. In two functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, we find that the visual cortex dynamically updates object representations using this predictive contextual information. First, visual cortical representations of objects were enhanced when they rotated congruently (versus incongruently) with the surrounding scene. Second, the inferred orientation of the object could be decoded from visual cortex activity even when the object was fully occluded. These findings indicate that predictive processes in the visual cortex follow the geometric structure of the environment, providing a mechanism to support object perception in dynamic natural vision."

Yet, a notable challenge remains: the absence of compact and programmable building blocks for EM wave-based neural networks. To overcome this limitation, we propose a piezoelectric surface acoustic wave (SAW) memristor that integrates an Ag/SiO2/Au memristor with an acoustoelectric phase shifter. Operating at shorter wavelengths than EM waves, it offers a compact footprint and encodes tunable neural network parameters via nonvolatile programmability and the acoustoelectric effect. A proof-of-concept SAW memristor neural network was experimentally demonstrated on a vector classification task, achieving 91.7% accuracy on par with software while reducing footprint by 105times versus EM systems and energy consumption by 37 times versus digital systems.

Two cell-based modalities can target pHLA-expressing tumors: T cell receptors (TCRs) or TCR-mimetic (TCRm) antibodies reformatted as chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). Using HLA-A2/MAGEA4230–239as a model pHLA, we discerned the relative potency of TCR-T and CAR-T cells, informing how to best deploy these for clinical benefit. Although TCR-T cells were more sensitive at detecting low-density pHLA, TCR-T cells exerted only transient in vivo antitumor efficacy followed by tumor relapse due to deficient TCR-T cell proliferation and persistence that was associated with a more differentiated and dysfunctional phenotype. By contrast, CAR-T cells with encoded costimulatory signaling fully regressed tumors. Insufficient TCR-T cell durability was overcome by coengaging 41BB or IL-2 signaling pathways, thereby enhancing tumor control in vivo. These data establish differential activities of human TCR-T and CAR-T cells targeting the same pHLA and inform the development of optimal targeting strategies to induce durable clinical responses."

Whether this protection extends into early adulthood remains uncertain. We conducted genome-wide association studies on body mass index (BMI) in nulliparous women from menarche to <40 years across five cohorts, with additional analyses in three subintervals of this life stage. Results were meta-analyzed, and two-sample univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization was applied within a lifecourse framework to assess the effect of BMI on breast cancer risk. Between menarche and <40 years, we observed heterogeneity in genetic effects. Genome-wide correlations further suggest that BMI during this early adult period may be partly influenced by distinct genetic factors compared with adiposity at other life stages. Higher genetically proxied BMI between menarche and 40 years reduced breast cancer risk. This protective effect attenuated after adjusting for prepubertal adiposity. These findings refine our understanding of adiposity’s role in breast cancer and highlight earlier life stages as critical windows for risk modulation."

We previously showed a hallmark of CAF-like EwS cells is their hybrid transcriptional state wherein the driver fusion oncogene, EWS::FLI1, maintains activation of proliferative programs but loses capacity to repress mesenchymal genes. Here, we studied primary patient tumors and cell line models to identify molecular drivers of this hybrid state. Our data reveal that hybrid EwS cells are induced and maintained by a transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ) signaling positive feedback loop. Hybrid cells derepressTGFBR2and up-regulate expression and secretion of TGFβ2 to sustain pathway activation and ECM deposition. Although TGFβ ligands can potently induce growth arrest in cells of epithelial origin, we show that TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 promote cell invasion of EwS cells without affecting proliferation. Thus, stroma-derived and tumor-derived TGFβ ligands induce and maintain hybrid EwS cells to promote pro-metastatic cell phenotypes."

Despite advances in measurement methods, long-term (>1 day) acquisition techniques remain limited, hindering continuous monitoring. Current long-term techniques rely on invasive electrodes, as noninvasive electrodes fall short in operational duration and conformability. Here, a capacitively coupled electrode with an adaptable coupling layer is developed for noninvasive, month-long electrophysiological monitoring on diverse plants. The adaptable coupling layer is formed by in situ sol-gel transition, followed by dehydration of thermoresponsive hydrogel on plants, achieving high conformability to complex surfaces and stable electrical coupling. For 1 month on trichome-covered plant surfaces, the electrode maintains a high signal-to-noise ratio comparable to a gold-standard noninvasive electrode, which typically lasts a few hours. Long-term monitoring reveals drought-specific signal features that correlate with plant water status. Physiological investigations indicate an essential role of calcium and reactive oxygen species, highlighting the potential of our electrode in generating biological insights and inspiring plant sensing innovations."

Two-dimensional (2D) material-based membrane technology provides an energy-efficient approach; however, the existing 2D lamellar membranes and nanoporous membranes struggle with low permeability and complex preparation procedures. Here, we constructed 2D lamellar nanosheet membranes with intrinsic size-sieving nanopores by assembling nanoporous polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) nanosheets into a lamellar membrane. These membranes exhibit high selectivity and permeance and ease of preparation. By applying MXene as the strong interaction patch for covering and repairing defects on PCN nanosheets, the resultant membranes demonstrated an ultrahigh H2permeance of 870 to 8046 GPU, considerable selectivity, and superior long-term stability, outperforming most current state-of-the-art membranes. Economic analysis revealed that MXene/PCN membranes achieved ultralow energy consumption and minimal membrane area demands for practical applications. This study inspires the construction of 2D lamellar membranes with intrinsic nanopores and provides a simple and scalable approach to preparing high-performance 2D nanosheet membranes for hydrogen separation."

It fosters the circulation of goods and information and enables kinship ties across different scales, including long-distance contacts. While such behaviors are known since at least the Upper Palaeolithic, evidence for geographically extensive social networks remains scarce. This evidence is limited to indirect inferences based on shared cultural traits, “art” styles, and symbolic items, while lithic raw material movements are mostly local and regional, with few cases exceeding 300 kilometers. We provide geochemical evidence for the largest confirmed distance between the source and discard location of a knapped lithic object in Palaeolithic Europe. Solutrean artifacts discarded at Peña Capón, Central Iberia, were sourced in Southwest France, 600 to 700 kilometers away. This demonstrates social networks of unprecedented geographic scale maintained during ∼1400 years during the Last Glacial Maximum. It also suggests that stone tools were exchanged as symbolic items to solidify social contacts and sustain far-reaching networks as risk-buffering mechanisms among widely dispersed hunter-gatherers."

Poulton,Dynamic redox–promoted iron and nutrient cycling drove graptolite evolution across the Ordovician-Silurian transition,"Graptolites were abundant and cosmopolitan zooplankton in Early Paleozoic oceans, but a prominent change in species occurred across the Late Ordovician mass extinction. We use ocean redox, iron isotope (δ56Fe), and phosphorus phase partitioning records from shelf and deep-ocean settings to evaluate the drivers behind this major reshaping of the pelagic marine ecosystem. A marked decrease in mesopelagic graptolites coincided with a stepwise negative δ56Fe shift on the shelf, driven by partial seawater Fe drawdown resulting from episodic intensification of mid-depth euxinia. Subsequently, a positive δ56Fe shift in both deep-ocean and shelf sediments reflects extensive seawater Fe removal during the development of more widespread euxinia. This led to enhanced sedimentary phosphorus recycling from sediments, which ultimately fueled the radiation of epipelagic graptolites. Thus, wide-scale changes in Fe cycling, linking the global oceanic redox state to phosphorus cycling, were ultimately responsible for the initial demise and subsequent radiation of select graptolite species."

Here, we present a solution-processed photovoltaic nanoassembly comprising a ZnO nanowire array sensitized with AgBiS2nanocrystals that enables efficient near-infrared (NIR) neural stimulation through capacitive photocurrents. By optimizing nanowire morphology and nanocrystal interdigitation, the platform achieves high charge injection densities (tens of microcoulombs per square centimeter) at low NIR intensities (<1 milliwatt per square millimeter). The nanoassembly was subretinally placed in an ex vivo blind rat retina, where it elicited repeatable and robust responses in retinal ganglion cells under NIR pulses. Notably, these responses were achieved at light intensities substantially below established ocular safety limits. The nexus of neuronal systems and nanoassemblies offers potential for enabling unconventional visual prosthetics and advanced neuromodulation therapies."

Two common approaches are kinetic modeling and constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA). COBRA models analyze steady-state fluxes using linear constraints but lack kinetic detail. Kinetic models offer mechanistic descriptions via differential equations but require (often unknown) kinetic parameters and enzyme concentrations. To bridge this gap, we introduce COBRA-k, a framework integrating nonlinear kinetic rate laws into COBRA models to consistently constrain metabolic fluxes, enzyme abundances, and metabolite concentrations. COBRA-k enables flexible exploration of metabolic steady states with optimization techniques, even with incomplete parametrization. COBRA-k models require solving computationally demanding mixed-integer nonlinear programs. We therefore developed a dedicated iterative algorithm, implemented in an open-source Python package. We applied COBRA-k to a large-scaleEscherichia colimodel, demonstrating its effectiveness and revealing holistic metabolic insights. For example, it accurately predicts and explains the phenomenon of high intracellular glutamate concentration. COBRA-k combines the flexibility of COBRA with kinetic precision, offering a powerful tool for predictive metabolic modeling and engineering."

Despite its importance, the landscape and consequences of transcription stress remain underexplored. Here, we used maps of DSBs identified through sBLISS (in-suspension break labeling in situ and sequencing) with transcription stress markers to delineate the transcription stress landscape in cancer. We found that transcription stress sites are shaped by the superenhancer regulatory landscape. Notably, γH2AX is enriched at transcription stress sites; however, not all DSB-enriched genes show similar γH2AX marking. Instead, genes with DSBs tied to transcription stress are distinctly marked. Genes with high DSBs marked by γH2AX exhibited substantially higher DSB turnover and repair than those with low γH2AX, and are associated with vulnerability to mutagenesis. These findings underscore superenhancer activity as a determinant of the transcription stress landscape in cancer, posing a threat to the genomic stability of oncogenes."

Expanding the alphabet beyond the canonical base pairs can therefore be the key to push the technology to the next level. Here, we describe examples of DNA nanostructures built from an “anthropogenic evolvable genetic information system (AEGIS).” Because AEGIS uses the same backbone as DNA, the existing rules for designing DNA nanostructures can be readily applied to AEGIS nanostructures, which also show greater stability, both thermal and enzymatic, greater control over autonomous assembly, and good phase separation. AEGIS can have as many as 12 different units and six different pairs with Watson-Crick-Franklin geometry.

However, the contribution of inflammatory forms of cell death in lung carcinogenesis and their effects on the composition of the tumor-immune microenvironment remain unclear. Our multi-omics analyses of samples from patients with primary lung adenocarcinoma revealed that necrosome signaling is repressed because of reduced expression of receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3). Distinct methylation signatures, both in theRIPK3promoter and nonpromoter regions, correlated with lower transcription levels ofRIPK3. This resulted in limited expression of inflammatory genes, advanced histologic features, reduced immune cell invasion, and decreased patient survival. Mechanistically, we confirmed the tumor-suppressive role of necrosome signaling through the genetic deletion ofRipk3in two independent, clinically relevant mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma. Functionally, RIPK3 shaped a diverse immune environment by promoting the invasion of innate and adaptive immune cells in patient samples and experimental mice. Thus, RIPK3-mediated inflammatory signaling enhances a diverse immune microenvironment and hinders progression in lung adenocarcinoma."

The granuloma’s necrotic core, where bacteria reside extracellularly in humans, is difficult to assess in many experimentally tractable models. Here, using necrotic mycobacterial granulomas in adult zebrafish, we develop dual RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) across different host genotypes to identify the transcriptional alterations that enable bacteria to survive within this key microenvironment. Using pharmacological and genetic interventions, we find that neutrophils within mature, necrotic granulomas promote bacterial growth, in part through up-regulation of the bacterialdevRregulon. We identify conserved suites of bacterial transcriptional programs induced only in the context of this unique necrotic extracellular niche, including bacterial modules related to K+transport andrpfgenes. Analysis ofMycobacterium tuberculosisstrains across diverse lineages and human populations suggests that granuloma-specific transcriptional modules are targets for bacterial genetic adaptation in the context of human infection."
