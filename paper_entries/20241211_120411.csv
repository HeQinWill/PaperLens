10.1088/1748-9326/ad91ca,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究的是如何结合气候模型和观测数据来预测不同区域达到特定温度阈值（例如1.5°C、2.0°C、3.0°C）所需的时间。它采用了一种机器学习方法，利用卷积神经网络对气候模型的预测结果进行训练，并通过迁移学习将模型与观测数据相结合，从而提高预测精度。研究中使用了2023年的温度异常数据作为当前气候状态的输入，预测结果显示许多区域将在2040年或之前达到1.5°C和2.0°C的升温阈值。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它利用了卫星观测数据（虽然文中没有明确指出具体的卫星或传感器类型）来改进气候模型的预测，并最终用于预测区域温度变化，这与大气温度组成分析直接相关。,"['Temperature anomalies', 'Satellite observations', 'Climate models', 'Regional warming thresholds', 'Convolutional neural network', 'Transfer learning', 'Climate change prediction']",Elizabeth A Barnes;Noah S Diffenbaugh;Sonia I Seneviratne,Combining climate models and observations to predict the time remaining until regional warming thresholds are reached,"The importance of climate change for driving adverse climate impacts has motivated substantial effort to understand the rate and magnitude of regional climate change in different parts of the world. However, despite decades of research, there is substantial uncertainty in the time remaining until specific regional temperature thresholds are reached, with climate models often disagreeing both on the warming that has occurred to-date, as well as the warming that might be experienced in the next few decades. Here, we adapt a recent machine learning approach to train a convolutional neural network to predict the time (and its uncertainty) until different regional warming thresholds are reached based on the current state of the climate system. In addition to predicting regional rather than global warming thresholds, we include a transfer learning step in which the climate-model-trained network is fine-tuned with limited observations, which further improves predictions of the real world. Using observed 2023 temperature anomalies to define the current climate state, our method yields a central estimate of 2040 or earlier for reaching the 1.5 °C threshold for all regions where transfer learning is possible, and a central estimate of 2040 or earlier for reaching the 2.0 °C threshold for 31 out of 34 regions. For 3.0 °C, 26 °C out of 34 regions are predicted to reach the threshold by 2060. Our results highlight the power of transfer learning as a tool to combine a suite of climate model projections with observations to produce constrained predictions of future temperatures based on the current climate."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad959d,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文评论了Kornhuber等人(2019)的一篇关于2018年夏季早期极端天气事件与7波数半球罗斯贝波型相关性的文章。评论指出，K19文章中使用的低通滤波处理后的Hovmöller图导致了对罗斯贝波型的不准确和不完整的描述，夸大了其环球性和准静止性。评论认为，使用未经滤波的Hovmöller图则不支持K19文章中提出的结论。因此，该论文主要关注的是大气环流中的罗斯贝波模式及其在描述极端天气事件中的应用，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）关系不大。,"['Rossby waves', 'Hovmöller diagrams', 'wave patterns', 'atmospheric circulation', 'extreme weather events']",Jacopo Riboldi;Emmanuele Russo,Comment on ‘Extreme weather events in early summer 2018 connected by a recurrent hemispheric wave-7 pattern’,"The depiction of Rossby wave patterns in Hovmöller diagrams can be severely altered if low-pass filtering is applied to the data. Due to filtering, transient waves may appear stationary, and unphysical wave properties may emerge. This observation is particularly relevant in the context of the discussion about the existence of circumglobal, quasi-stationary Rossby waves related to extreme weather events. This commentary shows that the wavenumber-7 Rossby wave pattern of early Summer 2018 discussed by Kornhuber et al (2019 Environ. Res. Lett.14 054002) (K19) emerged from a low-pass filtered version of an Hovmöller diagram, which displayed an unrealistic and incomplete representation of the hemispheric Rossby wave pattern. The use of an unfiltered Hovmöller diagram, on the other hand, does not support the claimed circumglobal extent and quasi-stationary propagation of the Rossby wave pattern claimed by K19."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad95a5,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文探讨了2018年夏季北半球持续存在的7波长型波浪模式，这种模式与北半球和南半球中纬度地区的极端天气事件同步发生有关。文章认为，这种大尺度环流对人为气候变化的响应，需要来自气候和天气研究领域的多种视角和诊断方法。虽然文章没有直接提及具体的空气质量监测技术或卫星传感器类型，但其研究主题与大气环流、温度异常等密切相关，而这些都需要通过例如卫星遥感等技术进行观测和分析。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术，特别是利用卫星观测来研究大气环流和气候变化，具有很强的关联性。,"['temperature anomalies', 'wave patterns', 'mid-latitude jets', 'atmospheric circulation', 'climate change', 'satellite observations']",Kai Kornhuber;Dim Coumou;Stefan Petri;Scott Osprey;Stefan Rahmstorf,Reply to Comment on ‘Extreme weather events in early summer 2018 connected by a recurrent hemispheric wave-7 pattern’,"Circumglobal teleconnections from wave-like patterns in the mid-latitude jets can lead to synchronized weather extremes in the mid-latitudes of Northern and Southern hemispheres. The simultaneous occurrence of record breaking and persistent northern hemisphere temperature anomalies in Summer 2018 were previously discussed in the context of a persistent zonally elongated wave-7 pattern that stretched over large parts of the northern hemisphere over an extended time and let to considerable societal impacts. Various diagnostics have been put forward to quantify and detect such wave patterns, many of which incorporate low-pass time filtering to separate signal from noise. In this response we argue that advancing our understanding of the large-scale circulation’s response to anthropogenic climate change and reducing associated uncertainties in future climate risk requires a diverse range of perspectives and diagnostics from both the climate and weather research communities."
10.5194/acp-24-13587-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了郑州市交通枢纽处挥发性有机物（VOCs）的时空变化特征及其来源，重点关注了奥密克戎疫情防控政策变化对VOCs污染的影响。研究通过为期两个月的连续在线监测，分析了不同时期VOCs的组成、来源以及二次有机气溶胶（SOA）的生成潜力。结果表明，工业排放是VOCs的主要来源，其次是车辆排放和燃烧排放。疫情防控政策变化前后，主要污染源的贡献比例有所变化，例如，疫情期间工业排放贡献最大，而政策取消后，车辆排放成为主要来源。研究还识别出两个重污染事件，并分析了其污染特征和SOA生成潜力。总的来说，该研究利用地面监测数据，定量分析了政策变化对空气质量的影响，为VOCs污染控制提供了科学依据。虽然没有直接使用遥感技术，但其研究结果与大气环境遥感密切相关，可以为遥感反演模型的改进和应用提供数据支持。,"['Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)', 'Air Quality Monitoring', 'Ground-based observation', 'PM2.5', 'Source apportionment', 'Pollution events']",Bowen Zhang;Dong Zhang;Zhe Dong;Xinshuai Song;Ruiqin Zhang;Xiao Li,The variations in volatile organic compounds based on the policy change for Omicron in the traffic hub of Zhengzhou,"To gain insight into the impact of changes due to epidemic control policies, we undertook continuous online monitoring of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at an urban site in Zhengzhou over a 2-month period. This study examines the characteristics of VOCs, their sources, and their temporal evolution. It also assesses the impact of the policy change on VOC pollution during the monitoring period, thus providing a basis for further research on VOC pollution and source control. 
 Online volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were monitored before and after the Omicron policy change at an urban site in polluted Zhengzhou from 1 December 2022 to 31 January 2023. The characteristics and sources of VOCs were investigated. The daily mean concentrations of PM2.5 and total VOCs (TVOCs) ranged from 53.5 to 239.4 µg m−3 and 15.6 to 57.1 ppbv, respectively, with mean values of  111.5 ± 45.1 µg m−3 and 36.1 ± 21.0 ppbv, respectively, throughout the period. Two severe pollution events  (designated as case 1 and case 2) were identified in accordance with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) (China's National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) from 2012). Case 1 (5 to 10 December PM2.5 daily mean = 142.5 µg m−3) and case 2 (1 to 8 January PM2.5 daily mean = 181.5 µg m−3) occurred during the infection period (when the policy of “full nucleic acid screening measures” was in effect) and the recovery period (after the policy was canceled), respectively. The PM2.5 and TVOC values for case 2 are, respectively, 1.3 and 1.8 times higher than those for case 1. The precise influence of disparate meteorological circumstances on the two pollution incidents is not addressed in this study. The results of the positive matrix factor modeling demonstrated that the primary source of VOCs during the observation period was industrial emissions, which constituted 32 % of the total VOCs, followed by vehicle emissions (27 %) and combustion (21 %). In case 1, industrial emissions constituted the primary source of VOCs, accounting for 32 % of the total VOCs. In contrast, in case 2, the contribution of vehicular emission sources increased to 33 % and became the primary source of VOCs. The secondary organic aerosol formation potential for case 1 and case 2 were found to be 37.6 and 65.6 µg m−3, respectively. In case 1, the largest contribution of SOA formation potential (SOAP) from industrial sources accounted for the majority (63 %; 23.8 µg m−3), followed by vehicular sources (18 %). After the end of the epidemic and the resumption of productive activities in the society, the difference in the proportion of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) generated from various sources decreased. Most of the SOAP came from solvent use and fuel evaporation sources, accounting for 32 % (20.9 µg m−3) and 26 % (16.8 µg m−3), respectively. On days with minimal pollution, industrial sources and solvent use remain the main contributors to SOA formation. Therefore, the regulation of emissions from industry, solvent-using industries, and motor vehicles needs to be prioritized to control the PM2.5 pollution problem."

Squires;Ben Laurence;Ben Wōden;Andrew J. Smith;Andrew D. Ward;Christian Pfrang,Experimental observation of the impact of nanostructure on hygroscopicity and reactivity of fatty acid atmospheric aerosol proxies,"We followed nano-structural changes in mixtures found in urban organic aerosol emissions (oleic acid, sodium oleate and fructose) during humidity change and ozone exposure. We demonstrate that self-assembly of fatty acid nanostructures can impact water uptake and chemical reactivity, affecting atmospheric lifetimes, urban air quality (preventing harmful emissions from degradation and enabling their long-range transport) and climate (affecting cloud formation), with implications for human health. 
 Atmospheric aerosol hygroscopicity and reactivity play key roles in determining an aerosol's fate and are strongly affected by its composition and physical properties. Fatty acids are surfactants commonly found in organic aerosol emissions. They form a wide range of different nanostructures dependent on water content and mixture composition. In this study we follow nano-structural changes in mixtures frequently found in urban organic aerosol emissions, i.e. oleic acid, sodium oleate and fructose, during humidity change and exposure to the atmospheric oxidant ozone. Addition of fructose altered the nanostructure by inducing molecular arrangements with increased surfactant–water interface curvature. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was employed for the first time to derive the hygroscopicity of each nanostructure, thus addressing a current gap in knowledge by measuring time- and humidity-resolved changes in nano-structural parameters. We found that hygroscopicity is directly linked to the specific nanostructure and is dependent on the nanostructure geometry. Reaction with ozone revealed a clear nanostructure–reactivity trend, with notable differences between the individual nanostructures investigated. Simultaneous Raman microscopy complementing the SAXS studies revealed the persistence of oleic acid even after extensive oxidation. Our findings demonstrate that self-assembly of fatty acid nanostructures can significantly impact two key atmospheric aerosol processes: water uptake and chemical reactivity, thus directly affecting the atmospheric lifetime of these materials. This could have significant impacts on both urban air quality (e.g. protecting harmful urban emissions from atmospheric degradation and therefore enabling their long-range transport) and climate (e.g. affecting cloud formation), with implications for human health and well-being."

 Ozone depletion events (ODEs) occur every spring in the Arctic and have implications for the region's atmospheric oxidizing capacity, radiative balance, and mercury oxidation. Here, we comprehensively analyze ozone, ODEs, and their connection to meteorological and air mass history variables through statistical analyses, back trajectories, and machine learning (ML) at Villum Research Station, Station Nord, Greenland, from 1996 to 2019.We show that the ODE frequency and duration peak in May, followed by April and March, which is likely related to air masses spending more time over sea ice and increases in radiation from March to May. Back trajectories indicate that, as spring progresses, ODE air masses spend more time within the mixed layer, and the geographic origins move closer to Villum. Positive trends in ODE frequency and duration are observed during May (low confidence) and April (high confidence), respectively. Our analysis revealed that ODEs are favorable under sunny, calm conditions, with air masses arriving from northerly wind directions with sea ice contact.The ML model was able to reproduce the ODE occurrence and illuminated that radiation, time over sea ice, and temperature were important variables for modeling ODEs during March, April, and May, respectively. Several variables displayed threshold ranges for contributing to the positive prediction of ODEs vs. non-ODEs, notably temperature, radiation, wind direction, time spent over sea ice, and snow on land. Our ML methodology provides a framework for investigating and comparing the environmental drivers of ODEs between different Arctic sites and can be applied to other atmospheric phenomena (e.g., atmospheric-mercury depletion events)."

Moreover, the analysis evaluates the partial role of urban vegetation in impacting all biogenic emissions. We found substantial increases in ozone due to these emissions, and about 10% of this increase is attributable to vegetation within urban areas. 
 The paper evaluates the long-term (2007–2016) impact of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions on urban ozone patterns over central Europe, specifically focusing on the contribution of urban vegetation using a regional climate model coupled offline to a chemistry transport model. BVOCs are emitted by terrestrial ecosystems, and their impact is considered especially important over NOx-rich environments such as urban areas. The study evaluates the impact of BVOC emissions on ozone (O3), formaldehyde (HCHO), and hydroxyl radical (OH) near-surface concentrations, showing an increase in summer ozone by 6 %–10 % over large areas in central Europe due to their emissions. It also demonstrates a substantial increase in formaldehyde concentrations. Additionally, the impact of BVOC emissions on hydroxyl radical concentrations shows a decrease over most of the modeled region by 20 %–60 %, with some increases over urban areas. Impacts on peroxy radicals (HO2 and higher RO2) are shown too.Importantly, the study explores the partial role of urban vegetation in modulating ozone and evaluates its contribution to the overall ozone formation due to all BVOC emissions. The findings reveal that urban BVOC emissions contribute to around 10 % of the total impact on ozone and formaldehyde concentrations in urban areas, indicating their significant but localized influence.The study also conducts sensitivity analyses to assess the uncertainty arising from the calculation of the urban fraction of BVOC emissions. The results show that the impact of urban BVOC emissions responds to their magnitude nearly linearly, with variations up to 4-fold, emphasizing the importance of accurately quantifying the urban BVOC fluxes. Overall, the study sheds light on the intricate relationship between urban vegetation, BVOC emissions, and their impact on atmospheric chemistry, providing valuable insights into the regional chemistry of BVOC emissions over central Europe and the causes of urban ozone pollution."

Terminal velocity is fastest at Nyalam and slowest at Lhasa.  Five microphysical characteristics exhibit different correlations with altitude. Z–I relationships differ by site, and both exponential and gamma distributions fit DSD, with gamma parameters varying with altitude. 
 To enhance the precision of precipitation forecasting in the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau region, a comprehensive study of both macro- and micro-characteristics of local precipitation is imperative. In this study, we investigated the particle size distribution, droplet velocity, droplet number density, Z–I (radar reflectivity–rainfall intensity) relationship, and gamma distribution of precipitation droplet spectra with a single precipitation duration of at least 20 min and precipitation of 5 mm or more at four stations (Nyalam, Lhasa, Shigatse, and Naqu) in Tibet during recent years from June to August. The results are as follows: (1) in the fitting relationship curve between precipitation raindrop spectral particle size and falling speed at the four stations in Tibet, when the particle size was less than 1.5 mm, the four lines essentially coincided. When the particle size exceeded 1.5 mm, the speed in Nyalam was the highest, followed by Naqu, and the speed in Lhasa was the lowest. The falling speed of particles correlated with altitude. (2) The five microphysical characteristics (mean diameter (Dm), average volume diameter (Dv), mode diameter (Dd), dominant diameter (Dp), and median diameter (Dnd)) at the four stations have different correlation relationships with altitude under different rainfall intensities. Dm exhibits a negative correlation with altitude at the same rainfall intensity; in contrast, Dv shows a positive correlation with altitude. For microphysical parameters such as Dd and Dp, a rainfall intensity of 10 mm h−1 serves as the boundary line, and they have different correlation relationships with altitude under the same rainfall intensity level. (3) The Z–I relationships at the four stations exhibited variations. Owing to the proximity in altitude between Lhasa and Shigatse, as well as between Nyalam and Nagqu, the coefficient a and index b in the Z–I relationships of the two groups of sites were relatively similar. (4) The fitting curves of the exponential and gamma distributions of the precipitation particle size at the aforementioned four stations are largely comparable. The exponential distribution fitting exhibits a slightly better effect. The parameter μ in the gamma distribution decreases with an increase in altitude, while N0 and λ in the exponential distribution show a clear upward trend with altitude."

 Polarimetric radio occultations (PROs) represent an augmentation of the standard radio occultation (RO) technique that provides precipitation and cloud vertical information along with the standard thermodynamic products. A combined dataset that contains both the PRO observable retrievals and the RO standard retrievals, the resPrf, has been developed with the aim of fostering the use of these unique observations and fully exploiting the scientific implication of having information about vertical cloud structures with an intrinsically collocated thermodynamic state of the atmosphere. This paper describes such a dataset and provides detailed information on the processing of the observations. The procedure followed at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) to combine both horizontal (H) and vertical (V) observations to generate profiles equivalent to those in standard RO missions is described in detail, and the obtained refractivity is shown to be of equivalent quality compared to that from TerraSAR-X. The steps for the processing of the PRO observations are detailed, derived products such as the top of the signal are described, and validation is provided.Furthermore, the dataset contains the simulated ray trajectories for the PRO observation and collocated information with global satellite-based precipitation products, such as merged rain rate retrievals or passive microwave observations. These collocations are used for further validation of the PRO observations, and they are also provided within the resPrf profiles for additional use. It is also shown how accounting for external collocated information can significantly improve the effective PRO horizontal resolution, tackling one of the challenges of the technique.

Uncertainty in Vs impacts seismic hazard predictions. Stochastic procedures model this uncertainty, but must be calibrated using detailed geological data and Vs databases. This paper provides a new Vs profile database for Piedmont (NW Italy), integrating geological modeling and geophysical data, supporting similar studies in other regions. 
 The prediction of earthquake ground motions, and consequent seismic hazard of a specific area of study, is usually based on ground response evaluations of a statistical representative sample of possible soil and rock profiles. With this aim shear wave velocity (Vs) properties of the profiles are of paramount importance, given that uncertainty in this parameter play a major role in ground motion prediction and in its variability. Usually, stochastic procedures are adopted to model this uncertainty, and several stochastic approaches have been developed. These approaches should be however calibrated on detailed geological-geomorphological information and specific Vs profiles databases. Within this context the present paper is aimed to provide a new extensive database of Vs profiles over the Piedmont Region (NW Italy). These data are obtained through a specific workflow developed for their evaluation at the regional scale merging the information of specific geological-geomorphological modelling and devoted geophysical data collection. The obtained database (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13685087) could be used as the basis of Vs randomization approaches also in different geological contexts and results from the specific data analyses performed could be adopted as reference for similar materials in analogous geological contexts."

These innovations improve understanding of livestock seasonal dynamics and provide data for effective livestock management and policy-making. 
 Understanding the spatial-temporal distribution of grazing livestock is crucial for assessing the sustainability of livestock systems, managing animal diseases, mitigating climate change risks, and controlling greenhouse gas emissions. In China, grazing ruminants are mostly distributed across the vast grasslands in semi-humid and alpine areas. However, existing datasets of gridded distribution of grazing ruminants in China do not distinguish grazing ruminants with other livestock production systems, nor capture their long-term and seasonal dynamics, and tend to overestimate grazing livestock distribution. This study uses the county-level data from the Grassland Ecological Protection Subsidies to differentiate grazing livestock from other forms of livestock rearing. Interpretable machine learning models were used to detect the seasonality of grazing pasture and map the China’s long-term annual ruminant livestock distribution in grazing livestock production systems from 2000 to 2021 (CLRD-GLPS). The model's internal ten-fold cross-validation results (adjusted R2) for cattle ranged from 0.850 to 0.952 and for sheep from 0.780 to 0.836. External validation using province-level livestock meat production data yielded Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.83–0.88 for cattle and 0.92–0.94 for sheep, respectively. The CLRD-GLPS datasets provide more detailed, gridded information on local livestock distribution than census-based data. Compared to actual census data and the GLW datasets, they better capture the spatial-temporal dynamics of livestock distribution. Spatially, the largest cattle numbers on seasonal pastures were in the south-eastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), while the largest sheep numbers were in north-eastern Qinghai and Xinjiang. Temporally (2000–2021), cattle numbers increased near the Three-River Source National Park and Helan Mountains, while sheep numbers decreased on seasonal pastures on the QTP, with no significant changes on year-round pastures in Inner Mongolia.

It combines prior sedimentation scenarios with chronological information such as dated horizons, dated intervals, stratigraphic links and (for ice cores) Δdepth observations. Paleochrono-1.1 is available under an open-source license. 
 Past climate and environmental changes can be reconstructed using paleoclimate archives such as ice cores, lake and marine sediment cores, speleothems, tree rings, and corals. The dating of these natural archives is crucial for deciphering the temporal sequence of events and rates of change during past climate changes. It is also essential to provide quantified estimates of the absolute and relative errors associated with the inferred chronologies. However, this task is complex since it involves combining different dating approaches at different paleoclimatic sites and often on different types of archives. Here we present Paleochrono-1.1, a new probabilistic model to derive a common and optimized chronology for several paleoclimatic sites with potentially different types of archives. Paleochrono-1.1 is based on the inversion of an archiving model: a varying deposition rate (also named growth rate, sedimentation rate or accumulation rate) and also (for ice cores) a lock-in depth of air (since, in the absence of significant surface melt, the air is trapped in the ice at about 50–120 m below the surface) and a thinning function (since glacier ice undergoes flow). Paleochrono-1.1 integrates several types of chronological information: prior knowledge of the archiving process, independently dated horizons, depth intervals of known duration, undated stratigraphic links between records, and (for ice cores) Δdepth observations (depth differences between events recorded synchronously in the gas and solid phases of a certain core). The optimization is formulated as a least-squares problem, assuming that all probability densities are near-Gaussian and that the model is nearly linear in the vicinity of the best solution. Paleochrono-1.1 is the successor of IceChrono, which produces common and optimized chronologies for ice cores. Paleochrono-1.1 outperforms IceChrono in terms of computational efficiency, ease of use and accuracy. We demonstrate the ability of Paleochrono-1.1 in an experiment involving only the MSL speleothem in Hulu Cave (China), and we compare the resulting age model with the Speleothem Isotope Synthesis and Analysis version 2 (SISALv2) age models. We then demonstrate the multi-archive capabilities of Paleochrono in a new ice-core–speleothem dating experiment, which combines the Antarctic Ice Core Chronology 2023 dating experiment, based on records from five polar ice cores, with data from two speleothems from Hulu Cave, dated using uranium / thorium radiometric techniques. We analyze the performance of Paleochrono-1.1 in terms of computing time and memory usage in various dating experiments. Paleochrono-1.1 is freely available under the open-source MIT License."

The updated model shows increased fluxes in high-wind-speed and high-wave regions and vice versa, enhancing spatial heterogeneity. It shows that elemental mercury (Hg0) transfer velocity is more sensitive to wind speed. These findings may elucidate the discrepancies in previous estimations and offer insights into global Hg cycling. 
 The air–sea exchange of elemental mercury (Hg0) plays an important role in the global Hg cycle. Existing air–sea exchange models for Hg0 have not considered the impact of sea surfactants and wave breaking on the exchange velocity, leading to insufficient constraints on the flux of Hg0. In this study, we have improved the air–sea exchange model of Hg0 in the three-dimensional ocean transport model MITgcm (MIT General Circulation Model) by incorporating sea surfactants and wave-breaking processes through parameterization, utilizing the total organic carbon concentration and significant wave height data. The inclusion of these factors results in an increase of 62 %–225 % in the global transfer velocity of Hg0 relative to the baseline model. Air–sea exchange flux is increased in mid-latitude to high-latitude regions with high wind and wave-breaking efficiency, while it is reduced by surfactant and concentration change at low latitudes with low wind speeds and in nearshore areas with low wave heights. Compared with previous parameterizations, the updated model demonstrates a stronger dependence of Hg0 air–sea exchange velocity on wind speed. Our results also provide a theoretical explanation for the large variances in estimated transfer velocity between different schemes."

The system combines advanced, open-source models and can be used to study, for example, the ocean capture of atmospheric carbon dioxide, which is a key process in the global climate. The system produces realistic results, and we use it to investigate the roles of tides and sea ice in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. 
 This study presents DalROMS-NWA12 v1.0, a coupled ocean circulation–sea ice–biogeochemistry modelling system for the northwest Atlantic Ocean (NWA) in which the circulation and biogeochemistry modules are based on ROMS (Regional Ocean Modeling System). The circulation module is coupled to a sea ice module based on the Community Ice CodE (CICE), and the physical ocean state simulated by the circulation module drives the biogeochemical module. Study of the biological carbon pump in the NWA is one of the main intended applications of this model. Global atmospheric and ocean reanalyses are used to force DalROMS-NWA12 at the sea surface and as part of its lateral boundary input, respectively. The modelling system is also forced by tides, riverine freshwater input, and continental runoff. The physical ocean state and sea ice from two simulations of the period 2015–2018, with and without nudging of the simulated temperature and salinity towards a blend of observations and reanalysis, are examined in this study. Statistical comparisons between model results and observations or reanalyses show that the control (nudged) simulation outperforms the prognostic (un-nudged) simulation in reproducing the paths of the Gulf Stream and the West Greenland Current, as well as propagation of the estuarine plume in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The prognostic simulation performs better in simulating the sea ice concentration. The biogeochemical module, which is run only in the control simulation, performs reasonably well in reproducing the observed spatiotemporal variations in oxygen, nitrate, alkalinity, and total inorganic carbon. To examine the effects of tides and sea ice on the physical fields in the study area, results of simulations from which either component is absent are compared to results of the prognostic simulation. In the absence of tides, Ungava Bay in summer experiences a simulated surface salinity that is higher by up to ∼7 psu than in the simulation with tides, as well as experiencing changes in horizontal distributions of surface temperature and sea ice. Without coupling to the sea ice module, the circulation module produces summertime sea surface temperatures that are higher by up to ∼5 °C in Baffin Bay."

The model performance is evaluated for its ability to simulate El Niño and Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-related processes. The newly developed HCMROMS is expected to become an effective modeling tool for studying the multi-scale and multi-sphere interactions associated with ENSO in the tropical Pacific. 
 The El Niño and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) constitutes the most prominent interannual climate variation mode in the climate system, originating from ocean-atmosphere interactions in the tropical Pacific. Accurately modeling ENSO variation has consistently posed a great challenge, exhibiting strong model-dependent representations and simulations of ENSO. This study presents a novel Hybrid Coupled Model (HCM), denoted as HCMROMS, built upon the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) that has been widely used for regional modeling studies. For basin-wide applications to the tropical Pacific, here, the ROMS is incorporated with a statistical atmospheric model, which is based on singular value decomposition (SVD), capturing interannual relationships of atmospheric perturbations such as wind stress and freshwater flux anomalies with sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. The model is constructed in a flexible way so that various components representing atmospheric forcing and oceanic biogeochemistry can be easily included as a module in the HCMROMS. Results demonstrate that the HCMROMS can simulate a stable quasi-three-year ENSO cycle when the interannual wind stress coupling coefficient, ατ , is set at 1.5. The HCMROMS reproduces the three-dimensional (3D) evolution of ENSO-related anomalies, revealing that the most pronounced temperature anomalies occur beneath the surface at 150 m. The interannual temperature anomaly budget highlights the dominance of the advection process in the simulated ENSO. Vertical mixing contributes negatively to ENSO anomalies, damping temperature anomalies from the surface due to the turbulent heat flux feedback. This newly developed HCMROMS is poised to serve as an efficient modeling tool for ENSO research in the future."

To model these errors as accurately as possible, it is necessary to use a signal ray tracing algorithm which is informed of the state of the atmosphere. We developed such algorithm and tested it by modelling errors in GNSS network observations. Our algorithm's main advantage is loss-less utilization of atmospheric information provided by numerical weather prediction models. 
 Electromagnetic signals commonly used in geodetical applications, such as the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), undergo bending and delay in the neutral gas atmosphere of the Earth. The least-travel-time (LTT) concept is one of the approaches to model signal slant delays via a ray tracing (RT) procedure. In this study, we developed an LTT-based RT algorithm (LTT v2), where the 3-dimensional refractivity field of the atmosphere is based on the atmospheric model data. This representation is complete in a sense that the domain of the RT conforms to the native grid geometry of the atmospheric model. In addition, some physical and numerical approximations are improved compared to the previous version (LTT v1). The atmospheric states are generated using a global numerical weather prediction model, the Open Integrated Forecast System of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The slant delays of LTT v2 are compared with the products of the original least-travel-time GNSS delay model (LTT v1) and the products of the state-of-the-art VieVS Ray Tracer (RADIATE). The skill of slant delay estimation is assessed using metrics that are indicative of the quality of GNSS products derived using the GROOPS (Gravity Recovery Object Oriented Programming System) orbit solver software toolkit of the Graz University of Technology. Employment of slant delay products of the LTT RT algorithm shows radical improvement in GNSS processing. When using LTT v2 delay estimates, the GNSS orbit midnight discontinuities are reduced by more than 10 % compared to RADIATE, and more than 2 % compared to LTT v1. The residuals of ground station precise positioning are analysed with respect to the IGS14 reference positions. The RMS of residuals (accuracy) and standard deviation (precision) are substantialy reduced compared to RADIATE."

Copper bioavailability depended on the phytoplankton Cu nutritional state and whether Cu′ diffusion to the cell surface was sufficient to meet the cellular demands for growth. Under Cu-limiting conditions when [Cu′] was less than the diffusion concentration threshold (DCT: 10–14.13 M), growth rate was a hyperbolic function of [Cu-L]. Increasing [Cu′] above the DCT caused growth rate to increase proportionally, but growth rate also increased with increasing [Cu-L] so that both Cu′ and Cu-L were bioavailable. Short-term photosynthesis assays conducted under Cu-limiting conditions showed a similar response to Cu speciation. In contrast, the growth rate of Cu-inhibited cells at high [Cu′] varied inversely with [Cu2+] and was independent of [Cu-L], as previously reported. The change in Cu-L bioavailability correlated with expression levels of genes encoding the reduction-dependent, high-affinity Cu uptake pathway, which was regulated by [Cu′]. Our analysis shows that at [Cu′] typical of the open sea, T. oceanica-like phytoplankton are diffusion limited and must rely on Cu-organic complexes to fulfill their Cu requirements for growth."

Temporal sampling provided evidence for biotransformation of multiple precursors including tri- or dimethyl ammonio propyl perfluoroalkane sulfonamides. Additionally, the environmental stability (i.e., resistance to transformation) of ECF-based precursors was found to depend upon structural characteristics, including perfluoroalkyl chain length, presence of sulfonamide or carboxamide groups, and functional groups (e.g., a branch of carboxyalkyl group) attached to the nitrogen atoms.

A significant charge transfer between Pt species and ceria in the embedding structure occurred via the Pt-CeO2 interface, which induced the formation of a Pt4+-Ov-Ce3+ interfacial structure. Experimental research and theoretical calculations demonstrated that the active Pt4+-Ov-Ce3+ interface promoted the activation and migration of lattice oxygen, thus facilitating the participation of oxygen species in toluene oxidation. Consequently, Pt/CeO2-N showed excellent catalytic performance for toluene degradation.

However, the combined effects of eutrophication and such trait-based regulation on plankton communities and interactions remain poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated these effects by integrating trait-based mechanistic modeling and field observations in China’s eutrophic Pearl River Estuary. Our model predicted that the species with the weakest defensive capacities dominated under nutrient-poor conditions. As eutrophication increased, a concave growth–defense trade-off favored species with high growth rates and strong defense capacities, whereas a convex trade-off curve favored species that were either the least or the most well-defended. High grazing pressure accelerated these shifts. In the estuary, similar patterns emerged in the relative abundance of different phytoplankton species along a gradient of the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio (N:P), indicating changes from high nutrient uptake and low grazing under oligotrophic conditions to eutrophic conditions, in which some phytoplankton face considerable grazing pressure despite high nutrient uptake, whereas others grow slowly with less grazing pressure. These results enhance our understanding of trait-based plankton interactions in eutrophic bodies of water and provide support for more effective conservation and management strategies."

A key process is the co-boiling at the water–NAPL interface, which lowers the boiling point due to combined vapor pressures, potentially reducing energy needs. However, determining the optimal end time for heating is challenging due to the invisible nature of underground NAPL, often resulting in excessive energy use. The initial NAPL pool size and distance from the heat source influence the spatiotemporal evolution of the NAPL–water interface, defining three zones: the co-boiling equilibrium zone, a nonequilibrium zone, and an unaffected zone. The temperature data collected by fixed temperature sensors can reflect the spatiotemporal evolution of these zones, offering valuable insights into NAPL removal. This study tackles these challenges using a two-dimensional visualized sandbox integrated with real-time image processing and an array of temperature sensors to monitor the NAPL removal and temperature variation. The results reveal semiquantitatively the impact of different initial NAPL amounts and spatial distributions on temperature variations. An optimized strategy is proposed for temperature sensor positioning, and a qualitative relationship is established between the temperature increase and NAPL removal. These findings can enhance our understanding of subsurface temperature dynamics, supporting more efficient, decarbonized remediation practices."

The EEG has an impact on various soil ecological functions, primarily related to soil aggregation formation and stability as well as water repellence. Here, analytical pyrolysis–gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) was used for studying the molecular composition of soil EEG, and a detailed description of the chemical composition is reported. Samples extracted from Mediterranean soils under different vegetation covers (Pinus halepensis and shrubland species, Rosmarinus officinalis, and Brachypodium spp, predominantly), impacted or not by forest fires and collected at different times, were studied. A total of 139 compounds were identified and grouped based on their probable biogenic origin. The EEG chemical composition is dominated by lipids, aromatic compounds, steranes, and hydroaromatics with a remarkable abundance of compounds from plant origin. Significant EEG structural changes can indicate environmental disturbances such as those after a wildfire. The EEG soil organic fraction is found to be a stable and heat-resistant material in nature if soil temperatures remain below 200–250 °C. This study advances the understanding of EEG by providing a detailed molecular characterization and highlighting its role as a stable, heat-resistant component of soil organic matter in Mediterranean ecosystems.

This study estimates net GHG emissions of nations from the consumption perspective, considering both GHG sources and sinks influenced by human activities. Results show that 26% of global net GHG emissions were embodied in international trade. GHG footprints in tropical nations would be significantly underestimated if only sources are considered and sink changes are neglected, especially in Indonesia (counting 65% of its GHG footprints) and Africa (44%). After considering sink changes, the consumption of processed foods and animal products exerted larger impacts on GHG footprints of tropical nations, which is mainly attributed to emissions from forest conversion; and the GHG leakage through international trade from tropical nations (e.g., Indonesia) to other nations (e.g., India and the United States) was more prominent.

Departing from traditional models that attribute the increase in pHECM primarily to H+ expulsion via Ca2+-ATPase, we emphasize the significant role of polyamines. These ubiquitous biogenic amines conveyed by calicoblastic cells through polyamine transporters demonstrate a remarkable affinity for CO2. Their ability to form stable carbamate complexes is pivotal in facilitating carbonate ion transport, which is crucial for pH regulation and skeletal structure formation. In this study, a polyamine transporter inhibitor and a polyamine biosynthesis inhibitor in conjunction with the pH-sensitive probe 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (HPTS) were employed to monitor pH variations. Furthermore, FM1–43FX dye was utilized to delineate the extracellular calcifying medium (ECM), whereas calcein was applied to visualize paracellular gaps and ECM.

Our finding reveals a notable decrease in freezing rain occurrence in most areas. Despite a substantial temperature increase, internal variability overshadows climate forcing across a large portion of the eastern United States until about 2050.

Wise;Matthew P. Dannenberg;Gregory J. McCabe,"The Role of the Great Plains Low‐Level Jet in Moisture Transport, Streamflow, and Flooding in the Missouri River Basin","The Missouri River Basin, one of the primary agricultural regions in North America, is prone to large hydroclimatic variability and extreme events. The Great Plains low‐level jet (GPLLJ) is one of the major sources of moisture transport into this region, and concerns over moisture extremes already seen in the interior U.S. have been linked to changes in GPLLJ. However, the relationship between GPLLJ and precipitation in this region remains uncertain, with studies showing conflicting results that may be related to distinct types of jet events. Here, we use daily GPLLJ data to study connections between different types of jet events and precipitation, integrated water vapor transport, and synoptic conditions to better understand GPLLJ‐streamflow linkages. We assess GPLLJ conditions during historical flood events and potential future changes using CMIP6 projections. We find: (a) in May–September, GPLLJ is associated with 29%–46% of monthly precipitation and with increased precipitation intensity; (b) GPLLJ has a consistently positive impact on Missouri River streamflow over the warm season; (c) coupled jets have a larger impact on moisture transport than uncoupled jets, but streamflow impact is reduced, likely due to seasonal timing; (d) unusual jet conditions preceded historical warm‐season flood events; and (e) future projections indicate relatively small changes in GPLLJ meridional wind velocities along with large increases in moisture transport driven by humidity increases. Although future streamflow will be partially dependent on snowmelt from the upper basin, the projected intensification of warm‐season moisture transport to the Missouri River suggests possible increases in future flood risk."
10.1029/2024JD041566,False,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文主要研究华北地区干旱与土壤-大气耦合之间的关系。它利用ERA5再分析数据，定义了干耦合和湿耦合两种状态，并提出了一个标准化耦合干旱指数(SCDI)来描述干旱的时空演变。研究发现，干耦合加剧了土壤干旱和大气干燥，而湿耦合则有利于干旱的恢复。该研究关注的是陆面过程与大气环流的相互作用，而非大气环境遥感技术本身。虽然研究使用了再分析数据，但这是一种数据产品，而非遥感技术的直接应用。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强。,"['soil moisture', 'vapor pressure deficit', 'land-atmosphere coupling', 'drought monitoring', 'meteorological reanalysis']",Shuwen Zhang;Lan Wang;Chentao He,Dry Coupling Aggravates Soil Drought and Atmospheric Aridity Over North China,"The north China region frequently experiences drought during the warm season, significantly impacting the local water cycle and socioeconomic life. To better understand the role that local land‐atmosphere (L‐A) coupling plays in the modulation of drought, we utilize 40 years of the fifth generation of European Re‐Analysis (ERA5) data set. With the aid of two metrics, that is, convective triggering potential (CTP) and low‐layer humidity index (HI) that classify the local L‐A coupling into four regimes, we identify days characterized by dry and wet coupling patterns in the region and define a standardized coupling drought index (SCDI) based on the relative number of dry and wet coupling days over a period of time. The results show that on the dry coupling day, the atmosphere exhibits a higher demand for moisture with an increased net radiation and surface sensible heat flux, and a reduced latent heat flux, so the dry coupling promotes drying. Similarly, the wet coupling promotes wetting. During the dry coupling events (i.e., multiple days with similar coupling states), the positive feedback between soil moisture and atmospheric humidity, along with atmospheric conditions unfavorable for precipitation, result in a continuous decrease in soil moisture and an increase in vapor pressure deficit, which sustain and intensify both soil drought and atmospheric aridity. In contrast, wet coupling events are conducive to drought recovery. The SCDI effectively captures the spatiotemporal evolution of drought across varying intensities, showing that dry and wet coupling play an important role in the persistence and recovery of drought in north China."

In this paper, we present the first time‐resolved leader spectra of the optical component associated with a downward TGF. The TGF was observed by the Telescope Array Surface Detector (TASD) simultaneously with other lightning detectors, including a Lightning Mapping Array (LMA), an INTerFerometer (INTF), a Fast Antenna (FA), and a spectroscopic system. The spectroscopic system recorded leader spectra at 29,900 frames per second (33.44 μ ${\upmu }$s time resolution), covering a spectral range from 400 to 900 nm, with 2.1 nm per pixel. The recordings of the leader spectra began 11.7 ms before the −18 ${-}18$ kA return stroke and at a height of 2.37 km above the ground. These spectra reveal that optical emissions of singly ionized nitrogen and oxygen occur between 167 μ ${\upmu }$s before and 267 μ ${\upmu }$s after the TGF detection, while optical emissions of neutrals (H I, 656 nm; N I, 744 nm, and O I, 777 nm) occur right at the moment of the detection. The time‐dependent spectra reveal differences in the optical emissions of lightning leaders with and without downward TGFs."

 Paratyphoid B fever (PTB) is caused by an invasive lineage (phylogroup 1, PG1) of Salmonella enterica serotype Paratyphi B (SPB). However, little was known about the global population structure, geographic distribution, and evolution of this pathogen. Here, we report a whole-genome analysis of 568 historical and contemporary SPB PG1 isolates, obtained globally, between 1898 and 2021. We show that this pathogen existed in the 13th century, subsequently diversifying into 11 lineages and 38 genotypes with strong phylogeographic patterns. Following its discovery in 1896, it circulated across Europe until the 1970s, after which it was mostly reimported into Europe from South America, the Middle East, South Asia, and North Africa. Antimicrobial resistance recently emerged in various genotypes of SPB PG1, mostly through mutations of the quinolone-resistance-determining regions of gyrA and gyrB. This study provides an unprecedented insight into SPB PG1 and essential genomic tools for identifying and tracking this pathogen, thereby facilitating the global genomic surveillance of PTB.

 Driven by human ingenuity and creativity, the discovery of super-resolution techniques, which circumvent the classical diffraction limit of light, represent a leap in optical microscopy. However, the vast space encompassing all possible experimental configurations suggests that some powerful concepts and techniques might have not been discovered yet, and might never be with a human-driven direct design approach.

Here, the authors show that cyanobacterial endosymbionts expressing plastidic ADP/ATP carrier translocases from red algae and glaucophyte support photosynthesis-driven bioenergetic endosymbiosis, but not those from green land plants. 
 Cyanobacterial photosynthesis (to produce ATP and NADPH) might have played a pivotal role in the endosymbiotic evolution to chloroplast. However, rather than meeting the ATP requirements of the host cell, the modern-day land plant chloroplasts are suggested to utilize photosynthesized ATP predominantly for carbon assimilation. This is further highlighted by the fact that the plastidic ADP/ATP carrier translocases from land plants preferentially import ATP. Here, we investigate the preferences of plastidic ADP/ATP carrier translocases from key lineages of photosynthetic eukaryotes including red algae, glaucophytes, and land plants. Particularly, we observe that the cyanobacterial endosymbionts expressing plastidic ADP/ATP carrier translocases from red algae and glaucophyte are able to export ATP and support ATP dependent endosymbiosis, whereas those expressing ADP/ATP carrier translocases from land plants preferentially import ATP and are unable to support ATP dependent endosymbiosis. These data are consistent with a scenario where the ancestral plastids may have exported ATP to support the bioenergetic functions of the host cell. Cyanobacterial bioenergetics may have driven chloroplast evolution.

Here, authors identify two molecularly distinct sympathetic pathways that independently control the adrenal medulla and intestine. 
 The sympathetic nervous system is crucial for responding to environmental changes. This regulation is coordinated by the spinal sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPNs), innervating both postganglionic neurons and the adrenal gland. Despite decades of research supporting the concept of selective control within this system, the neural circuit organization responsible for the output specificity remains poorly understood. Here, by combining recent single-cell transcriptome data with viral-genetic toolkits in mice, we identify two subtypes of SPNs in the lower thoracic spinal cord, defined at the molecular level, exhibiting nonoverlapping patterns of innervation: one specifically projecting to the celiac/superior mesenteric ganglia, and the other targeting the adrenal grand. Chemogenetic manipulations on these distinct SPN subtypes revealed selective impacts on the motility of the gastrointestinal tracts or glucose metabolism mediated by the adrenal gland, respectively.

 Future carbon management strategies require storage in elemental form, achievable through a sequence of CO2 hydrogenation reactions. Hydrogen is recycled from molecular intermediates by dehydrogenation, and side product acetylene selectively hydrogenated to ethylene. Existing Pd alloy catalysts for gas purification underperform in concentrated feeds, necessitating novel concepts. Atomistic simulations unveil superior selectivity of Pd:C solid solutions that optimize chemisorption energies and preclude sub-surface hydrides, verified here with model thin films. Multiple design criteria deduced from conventional catalysts facilitate synthesizing a self-repairing Pd:C system of a laterally condensed catalyst (LCC). A Pd layer prepared on a designated SiO2 buffer layer enables control of reactive interface, sub-surface volume and extended functional interface towards the buffer. Function and metric are supervised by operando micro-spectroscopy. This catalyst design shows, ethylene productivity >1 kmolC2H4/gPd/hour is reproducibly achieved and benchmarked against known catalysts. Photovoltaics deposition technologies enable scalability on real-world substrates saving active metal. A design-of-experiment approach demonstrates the improvement potential of the LCC approach.

 Mountain permafrost, constituting 30% of the global permafrost area, is sensitive to climate change and strongly impacts mountain ecosystems and communities. This study examines 21st century permafrost warming in European mountains using decadal ground temperature data from sixty-four boreholes in the Alps, Scandinavia, Iceland, Sierra Nevada and Svalbard. During 2013–2022, warming rates at 10 metres depth exceed 1 °C dec−1 in cases, generally surpassing previous estimates because of accelerated warming and the use of a comprehensive data set. Substantial permafrost warming occurred at cold and ice-poor bedrock sites at high elevations and latitudes, at rates comparable to surface air temperature increase. In contrast, latent heat effects in ice-rich ground near 0 °C reduce warming rates and mask important changes of mountain permafrost substrates. The warming patterns observed are consistent across all sites, depths and time periods. For the coming decades, the propagation of permafrost warming to greater depths is largely predetermined already.

 Anthropogenic nitrogen inputs from the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River Basin have caused substantial environmental challenges in the northern Gulf of Mexico, such as coastal eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, and seasonal hypoxia. Addressing these issues requires a better understanding of the complex sources of nitrogen, which include fertilizers, groundwater, manure, and sewage. In this study, we analyzed the nitrogen isotopic composition of dissolved nitrate and particulate nitrogen from the Wax Lake Delta, a major distributary of the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River Basin that flows into the Gulf of Mexico. Our findings revealed that during the wet season, δ15N values of both nitrate and particulate nitrogen were consistently 2-3‰ lower compared to the dry season. This suggests that fertilizer-derived nitrogen, which has lower δ15N, is predominantly exported to the Gulf of Mexico during periods of high water discharge. These findings imply that adjusting fertilizer application timing could help reduce nitrogen loading and mitigate its environmental impact on the Gulf of Mexico.

Tree implementation reduces peak monthly temperatures to below 26 °C in 83% of the cities. Trees can lower pedestrian-level temperatures by up to 12 °C through large radiation blockage and transpiration.

 NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamic Investigation (GEDI) mission provides billions of lidar samples of canopy structure over the Earth's temperate and pantropical forests. Using the GEDI sample data alone, gridded height and biomass products have been created at a spatial resolution of 1 km or coarser. However, this resolution may be too coarse for some applications. In this study, we present a new method of mapping high spatial resolution forest height across large areas using fusion of data acquired by GEDI and TanDEM-X (TDX) Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR). Our method utilizes GEDI waveforms to provide vertical profiles of scatterers needed to invert a physically-based InSAR model to solve for canopy height. We then use 2-year GEDI canopy height and adaptive wavenumber (kZ)-based calibration models to reduce errors in the inverted canopy height caused by the limited penetration capability of the X-band signal in dense tropical forests and the impact of terrain. We apply this novel method over large areas including Gabon, Mexico, French Guiana and most of the Amazon basin, and generate continuous forest height products at 25 m and 100 m. After validating against airborne lidar data, we find that our canopy height products have a bias of 0.31 m and 0.46 m, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 8.48 m (30.02 %) and 6.91 m (24.08 %) at 25 m and 100 m respectively, for all sites combined. Compared to existing data products that integrate GEDI with passive optical data using machine learning approaches, our method reduces bias, has a lower RMSE, and does not saturate for tall canopy heights up to 56 m. A key feature of this study is that our canopy height product is complemented with an uncertainty of prediction map which provides information on the predictor's uncertainty around the actual value —an advancement over the standard error maps used in earlier studies, which provide uncertainty around the expectation of the predicted value. This integration approach enables the first-ever accurate and high-resolution mapping of forest canopy heights at unprecedented large areas from GEDI and TDX InSAR data fusion, serving as an essential foundation for pantropical aboveground biomass mapping."

 Domain adaptation is crucial for information integration of remote sensing systems, such as satellite constellations and space stations, to intelligently achieving full domain awareness. The conventional methods focus on aligning spatial features without fully considering the topological structure and semantic information in the scene, resulting in loss of useful information and suboptimal classification results. This situation becomes more severe and further complicated to deal with under the condition of few labels available in the source domain. To address the above problems, a spatial-topological-semantic alignment method called STSA is proposed to implement unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) with few source labels, fully exploring multiple types of information and their complementarity in remote sensing images (RSIs). The proposed method is applied to complete the classification task on a multi-modal cross-domain datasets with synthetic aperture radar (SAR), thermal infrared (TI), near infrared (NI), and short wavelength infrared (SW) images derived from Chinese Tiangong-2 manned spacecraft, as well as a Single modal cross-domain datasets with optical images. Compared with the state of the art UDA methods, even with only one labeled RSI in the source domain, the proposed methods still perform better and achieve satisfying accuracy. It properly explores valuable knowledge from unlabeled RSIs and improves the robustness and flexibility of the model, which is more suitable for UDA with few source labels in RSIs scene classification."

 Effectively leveraging landslide spatial location information is crucial for improving the accuracy of deep learning in predicting landslide susceptibility and exploring the impacts of predisposing factors. Current single deep learning models for landslide susceptibility assessment require enhancements in both prediction accuracy and robustness. Inclusion of non-interrelated positional information among samples leads to reduced prediction accuracy and challenges in quantifying landslide risk covariates. This study proposes a landslide susceptibility assessment method that integrates ensemble learning with geographically weighted concepts. Using a stacking method, a 1D convolutional neural network (1D-CNN), a recurrent neural network (RNN), and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network were combined to form the CRNN-LSTM ensemble model. Additionally, we constructed a deep learning geographically weighted regression (GW-DNN) model based on the deep learning principles and geographically weighted regression to quantify the impacts of landslide-predisposing factors.The experimental results show that the CRNN-LSTM model achieved AUC values of 0.977 and 0.961 on the training and validation sets, significantly outperforming the individual classifiers (AUC of 0.944 and 0.940 for the 1D-CNN model, 0.950 and 0.948 for the RNN model, and 0.956 and 0.952 for the LSTM model). Additionally, the GW-DNN model achieved R2 coefficients of 0.876 and 0.860 during the training and validation phases. These findings indicate that our proposed method not only highly accurately predicts landslide susceptibility but also provides a precise quantitative assessment of the impact of landslide-predisposing factors at specific spatial points (landslide units) in high-risk areas. These findings offer valuable technical support for landslide disaster prevention and mitigation."

 Accurate, rapid, and automated landslide detection is crucial for early warning, emergency management, and landslide mechanism analysis. Increasingly general-purpose detection models are being deployed for these complex and dynamic tasks involving features that are difficult to characterize. However, these models are computationally expensive and memory-hungry, while the accuracy and detection efficiency remain wanting. To address the above problems, this paper proposes an end-to-end model with high-precision and lightweight design for integrated landslide detection and segmentation. Here, we customized the backbone utilizing the advanced Efficient MOdel (EMO), and further used the linear cheap operation from GhostNet to reduce computational complexity. As a result, the total parameters of our models were reduced by up to 48.13%, compared to the baseline. Building on this, we employed a dynamic detection head with multiple attention mechanisms, and proposed a lightweight attention enhancement module for strengthened multi-scale feature extraction and fusion.

 Building generalization is an essential task in generating multi-scale topographic maps. The progress of deep learning offers a new paradigm to overcome the coordination challenges faced by conventional building generalization algorithms. Some studies have confirmed the feasibility of several original semantic segmentation networks, such as U-Net and its variants and the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN), for building generalization in image maps. However, they suffer from critical deformation effects, especially for large and geometrically complex buildings. Since learning building generalization essentially means modeling the subtle transformation of building footprints across scales, we argue that the spatial awareness of a neural network, for instance, regarding building size and shape, is crucial to effective learning. Thus, we propose a spatially-aware generative adversarial network, SpaGAN. It takes a representative cGAN, pix2pix, as the backbone, and modifies two modules: In the U-Net-based generator, an atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module replaces the conventional convolutional module to extract multi-scale features of buildings of varying sizes and shapes; in the PatchGAN-based discriminator, a signed distance map (SDM) module is used to capture the fine-grained shape difference for discrimination. The proposed network was comprehensively evaluated with a synthetic and a real-world dataset. The results demonstrate that SpaGAN outperforms existing baseline models (U-Net, ResU-Net, pix2pix) for building generalization, particularly in the real-world dataset. The new model can achieve more reasonable aggregation, simplification, and squaring generalization operators."

10.1016/j.atmosenv.2024.120981,True,Atmospheric Environment,这篇论文研究了4-硝基邻苯二酚（4NC），一种重要的光吸收物质，即棕色碳（BrC）的模型化合物，在水溶液中的光解过程。研究重点在于4NC在不同光解途径（∙OH自由基引发、三重态激发态3C*引发和直接光解）下的反应动力学、化学组成变化、光吸收特性和氧化电位变化。结果表明，∙OH自由基引发的光氧化反应速率最快，其次是3C*引发和直接光解。不同光解途径生成的产物种类和数量有所不同，3C*引发光解产生更多含氧物种。光解过程导致4NC的光吸收能力下降，但同时也产生一些新的BrC物种。∙OH自由基引发的光解能显著降低4NC的氧化电位，使其毒性降低。最后，论文估算了4NC在大气中不同环境下的寿命。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为棕色碳是影响大气辐射平衡和空气质量的重要组分，研究其光化学行为对于改进大气成分分析模型和提高卫星遥感监测精度具有重要意义。,"['Brown Carbon', 'Air Quality', 'Nitrophenols', 'Photolysis', 'Atmospheric Lifetime', 'Satellite Observation', 'Absorption', 'Spectroscopy']",Ruoyuan Lei;Yingying Sha;Haifeng Meng;Yu Huang;Jianhuai Ye;Dan Dan Huang;Yunjiang Zhang;Yun Wu;Yongjie Li;Xinlei Ge,"Aqueous phase photolysis of 4-nitrocatechol: Reaction kinetics, evolutions of chemical composition, light absorption and oxidation potential","•Aqueous photolysis of 4NC against ∙OH is the fastest, and can decreases its oxidation potential quickly. •Second-order aqueous photolysis and photo-bleaching rate constants of 4NC with ∙OH are 4.3 × 1010and 1.77 × 1010M−1s−1. •Aqueous photolysis with3C∗ produces more oxygenated and stronger light-absorbing species than it with ∙OH. 
 4-nitrocatechol (4NC) is a model compound of nitrophenols, an important group pf light-absorbing species, a.k.a., brown carbon (BrC), that have significant impacts on air quality and radiation forcing. This work aims to elucidate the kinetics, chemical and optical properties as well as oxidation potential (OP) of 4NC during aqueous photolysis. Results show that hydroxyl radical (∙OH) initiated photo-oxidation has the fastest reaction rate (6.1 × 10−5 s−1) followed by organic triplet state (3C∗) induced photolysis (3.8 × 10−5 s−1) and direct photolysis (2.4 × 10−5 s−1); the second-order rate constant of ∙OH with 4NC is determined to be 4.3 × 1010 M−1s−1. Reaction pathways of 3C∗-initiated photolysis and ∙OH-initiated photolysis are largely different, with the former generating more oxygenated species, but their mass yields of products after 12 h of irradiation are close (∼40 %). Aqueous ageing of 4NC overall leads to the decrease of light absorption, and the photo-bleaching rates are in an order of ∙OH (2.58 × 10−5 s−1) > 3C∗ (1.06 × 10−5 s−1) > direct photolysis (5.83 × 10−6 s−1); the second-order photo-bleaching rate constant of ∙OH with 4NC is 1.77 × 1010 M−1s−1. On the other hand, aqueous ageing can also produce BrC species (not sufficient to offset the photo-bleaching effect) of which some nitrogen-containing organics are an important part, and 3C∗-photolysis has the strongest production ability. Furthermore, aqueous photolysis of 4NC can decrease its OP, especially the ∙OH-photolysis products are nearly non-toxic while those from 3C∗-photolysis still has significantly high OP at the end of oxidation. Finally, we estimated the atmospheric lifetimes of 4NC against ∙OH in different atmospheric environments, which range from a few seconds to tens of hours."

10.1016/j.atmosres.2024.107826,True,Atmospheric Research,这篇论文研究了印度西高止山脉热带常绿山地环境中气溶胶的化学特性。研究使用了地面观测数据，分析了气溶胶不同粒径上的化学成分，包括碳质组分、水溶性离子、金属元素和气溶胶液态水（ALW）。通过正矩阵分解（PMF）分析，区分了长距离传输、局部排放和云处理对气溶胶的影响。结果表明，东北季风期间的主要气溶胶成分是(NH4)2SO4、有机物和ALW，它们源于长距离传输的生物质排放，并在云处理和与SO2的均相反应中发生转化。研究还发现，印度河-恒河平原（IGP）地区的气团富含硫酸盐，而东亚气团富含有机物，并与孟加拉湾的海洋排放混合。该研究与大气环境遥感技术间接相关，因为对气溶胶化学成分的深入了解有助于改进大气成分分析和空气质量监测模型，并为卫星观测数据的解释提供参考。虽然研究本身没有直接使用卫星数据，但其结果可以用于验证和改进大气遥感模型，从而间接地与大气环境遥感技术相关。,"['Aerosol chemistry', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Atmospheric composition', 'Satellite observations (indirectly)', 'PM2.5', 'PM10', 'Cloud processing', 'Long-range transport', 'Biomass burning', 'Sulfate', 'Organic matter', 'Elemental carbon', 'Sea salt']",A.R.

Suresh Babu,Size-speciated chemistry of aerosols during the continental to marine air-mass transition phase from tropical Western Ghats environment in peninsular India,"•Size-speciated aerosol chemistry from a tropical evergreen mountain environment. •PMF and diagnostic chemical ratios distinguish long-range, local, and cloud-processed aerosols. •Fine mode aerosols influenced by cloud-processed biomass emissions undergoing aqueous-phase reactions with SO2. •Presence of complex EC mixtures: locally influenced by sea-salt and long-range influenced by sulfate/secondary organics. •Sulfate-rich composition from IGP air-mass, organic-rich from East Asian air-mass characterized by high OM/OC factor. 
 Atmospheric aerosol characteristics from the Western Ghats (WG), a region that plays a prominent role in modulating the Indian monsoon, was evaluated to study the impacts of long-range transport, local sources, and cloud processing on their chemical properties. Size-segregated aerosols collected from Ponmudi (8.8°N, 77.1°E), a tropical high altitude location (960 m a.s.l.) in the southern part of the WG, during the continental to marine air-mass transition phase (January–April 2020–2021) were analysed for major chemical components, including carbonaceous species, water-soluble ionic species, metallic elements and aerosol liquid water (ALW). The major aerosol components during the north-east monsoon period were identified as (NH4)2SO4, organic matter, and ALW derived from long-range transported biomass emission plumes undergoing cloud processing and aqueous-phase reactions with SO2. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analysis revealed the presence of aged and mixed aerosol types, with influence from local anthropogenic emissions and secondary formation processes. The source profiles for different air-masses indicate that the IGP air-mass is dominated by anthropogenic continental sources rich in sulphates, while the East Asian air-mass comprises highly aged continental emissions rich in organics and mixed with marine emissions from the Bay of Bengal. Fine mode aerosol mass was reconstructed, and organic matter to organic carbon conversion factor was estimated after mass closure, which revealed relatively high values for East-Asian air-mass, providing evidence for their oxidation during long-range transport. The hill station was also influenced by local urban valley emissions transported to the site via daytime convection and sea-breeze circulation. Consequently, the aerosol system over this region exhibited a complex mixture, with elemental carbon particles coexisting with sea-salt, sulphate, and secondary water-soluble organics. The findings highlight the need for further studies to understand the role of chemically processed and mixed aerosol system in modifying regional climate dynamics and air quality over such sensitive ecosystems."

 In 2021, an exceptionally intense autumn rainfall event occurred in West China (WC), breaking historical precipitation records since 1961. A notable northward migration of rainfall center was observed during the season. This study utilized real-time forecast data from the ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) and CMA (China Meteorological Administration) models under the S2S (Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Prediction) project to examine the subseasonal predictability of the extreme ARWC event and its associated systems, providing a theoretical basis for forecasting extreme autumn rainfall. The results showed that both models underestimated the observed anomalous precipitation, however, ECMWF was able to predict the spatial distribution and intensity of different phases of the event up to 8 days in advance, while the CMA model exhibited poor skill. ECMWF and CMA both successfully predicted the intraseasonal northward migration of the rainfall 8 days and 5 days in advance, respectively. Further analysis revealed that ECMWF and CMA can reproduce the mid–high-latitude wave patterns associated with the intraseasonal variations in the EAWJ at lead times of 1–10 days, contributing to better predictions of the intraseasonal northward migration of the rainfall. Their ability to predict the tropical convection differed, with ECMWF more accurately reproducing the anomalous dipole tropical convection activities over the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool and the central-eastern Pacific 1–22 days in advance, and the characteristic that the convection eventually weakens over the maritime continent. This led to better predictions of the intraseasonal variations of the WPSH, giving the ECMWF model a higher forecasting skill for both periods of the extreme ARWC in 2021 compared to the CMA model."

 A deep convective system affected the southern Mediterranean on 3–4 December 2022 causing heavy rains and wind gusts over three Italian regions (Sicily, Calabria, and Apulia) and a tornado in Calabria. We study the forecast sensitivity of this multi-hazard weather event to different physical parameterizations and configuration settings of the WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) model, used at convection permitting horizontal resolution; in particular, we performed sensitivity tests on the role of the initial and boundary conditions, on the Sea Surface Temperature (SST), on the model horizontal resolution and on the cumulus parameterization. Moreover, a 6 h rapid update data assimilation analysis (3DVAR)/forecast cycle was investigated to further study the short-term forecast capabilities of the modeling system. Most of the WRF configurations are able to well simulate the characteristics of the weather system, even if there are differences among the configurations, especially at the local scale, which causes differences in forecast performances. We found that the quality of the forecast is sensitive to the initial and boundary conditions with the best members having a probability of detection around 30–40 % for rainfall intensities of 40–50 mm/6 h. Most of the forecasts decrease their performance for larger precipitation thresholds, with few exceptions. Specifically, we found that increasing the horizontal resolution was beneficial for the case study as the probability of detection remains larger than 0.2 for rainfall thresholds larger than 60 mm/6 h and up to 100 mm/6 h. In addition, the forecast with lightning and radar reflectivity data assimilation has a probability of detection larger than 0.4 for the same intense thresholds; in both cases false alarms are not increased. For the tornado simulation, no improvement was found adopting 3DVAR. A possible forecasting strategy for severe weather events is outlined."
