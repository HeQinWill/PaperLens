This study assesses the health impacts of these emissions under business-as-usual and various policy scenarios across 186 countries and territories, including 13 135 urban areas, until 2040, at a 1 km resolution. We evaluate emissions for 15 scenarios based on different combinations of key emission control measures. We use Goddard Earth Observing System -Chem Adjoint v35n for pollutant concentration modeling. We estimate PM2.5 and ozone-attributable premature mortalities following global burden of disease 2019 methodology, and an epidemiologically-derived concentration-response model for NO2-attributable new paediatric asthma cases. Implementing all measures identified in this study is projected to avoid 1.9 million (95% confidence interval 1.3 million-2.4 million) premature deaths and 1.4 million (95% confidence interval 0.7 million-1.7 million) new cases of paediatric asthma cumulatively from 2023 to 2040. These health benefits differ by region and age group. Adults aged 65 and older account for 70% of global avoidable years of life lost, and children under 5 represent 50% of global avoidable new paediatric asthma cases. In countries without Euro 6/VI-equivalent standards, implementing such standards could achieve 56% and 63% of the total benefits of all identified measures combined for avoidable premature deaths and new paediatric asthma cases respectively. Regional disparities in road transport-attributable air pollution and health burdens are projected to widen without additional policies. Less developed countries are projected to experience more adverse impacts. Developing countries and urban areas show substantial potential in reducing new paediatric asthma cases. Stronger policies are needed to mitigate these health impacts, particularly for vulnerable groups such as children and older adults, and to address the growing inequities in air pollution exposure and related health impacts across regions. This evidence is valuable to policymakers to identify and prioritize actions to protect public health."

Edwards;Fangzhou Guo;Jack Dibb;James H. Flynn III;Becky Alexander;Manabu Shiraiwa;Cort Anastasio,"Hydrogen peroxide photoformation in particulate matter and its contribution to S(IV) oxidation during winter in Fairbanks, Alaska","Hydrogen peroxide (HOOH) is an important oxidant that forms atmospheric sulfate. We demonstrate that the illumination of brown carbon can rapidly form HOOH within particles, even under the low-sunlight conditions of Fairbanks, Alaska, during winter. This in-particle formation of HOOH is fast enough that it forms sulfate at significant rates. In contrast, the formation of HOOH in the gas phase during the campaign is expected to be negligible because of high NOx levels. 
 The high levels of sulfate in wintertime particles in Fairbanks, Alaska, are a subject of keen research interest and regulatory concern. Recent results from the 2022 Alaska Layered Pollution And Chemical Analysis (ALPACA) field campaign indicate that roughly 40 % of wintertime sulfate in Fairbanks is secondary, with hydrogen peroxide (HOOH) the dominant oxidant. Since formation of HOOH in the gas phase should be negligible during ALPACA because of high levels of NOx, we examined whether reactions within particles could be a significant source of HOOH. To test this, we collected particulate matter (PM) samples during the ALPACA campaign, extracted them, illuminated them with simulated sunlight, and measured HOOH production. Aqueous extracts showed significant light absorption, a result of brown carbon (BrC) from sources such as residential wood combustion. Photoformation rates of HOOH in the PM extracts (PMEs; normalized to Fairbanks winter sunlight) range from 6 to 71 µM h−1. While light absorption is nearly independent of pH, HOOH formation rates decrease with increasing pH. Extrapolating to the concentrated conditions of aerosol liquid water (ALW) gives an average rate of in-particle HOOH formation of ∼ 0.1 M h−1. Corresponding rates of sulfate formation from particle-produced HOOH are 0.05–0.5 µgm-3h-1, accounting for a significant portion of the secondary sulfate production rate. Our results show that HOOH formed in particles makes an important contribution to sulfate formation in ambient wintertime particles, even under the low actinic flux conditions typical of winter in subarctic locations like Fairbanks."

McDonald;Colin Harkins;Owen R. Cooper,Surface ozone trend variability across the United States and the impact of heat waves (1990–2023),"Exposure to high levels of ozone can be harmful to human health. This study shows consistent and robust evidence of decreasing ozone extremes across much of the United States over the period from 1990 to 2023, previously attributed to ozone precursor emission controls. Nevertheless, we also show that the increasing heat wave frequencies are likely to contribute to additional ozone exceedances, slowing the progress of decreasing the frequency of ozone exceedances. 
 This paper outlines a comprehensive trend assessment of surface ozone observations across the conterminous USA over 1990–2023. A change point detection algorithm is applied to evaluate seasonal trends at various percentiles. We found that highly consistent and robust negative trends in extreme values have occurred in spring, summer, and fall since the 2000s across the eastern USA. A less strong but similar picture is found in the western USA, while increasing winter trends are commonly observed in the Southwestern and Midwestern regions of the country. The impact of a potential climate penalty that might offset some of the improvement in the ozone extremes is also investigated based on various heat wave metrics. By comparing ozone threshold exceedances, we found that the exceedance probabilities during heat waves are higher than those under normal conditions; moreover, the differences have decreased over time, as the effectiveness of emission controls has led to a great reduction in ozone extremes under both heat wave and normal conditions. When the increasing heat wave trends are accounted for, we find evidence that decreases in exceedances during heat waves have likely halted at 20 %–40 % of sites, depending on heat wave definitions. By identifying monitoring sites with (1) reliably decreasing ozone exceedances and (2) reliably increasing co-occurrences of ozone exceedances and heat wave events, we can show that several sites in California have been impacted by the ozone climate penalty (1995–2022). These findings are limited by the availability of long-term continuous ozone records, which are sparsely distributed across the USA and typically less than 30 years in length."

This paper presents a new technique for error-weighted PMF that drastically reduces the computational costs of previously developed algorithms. We use this technique to deliver interpretable factors and solution diagnostics from an atmospheric chemistry dataset. 
 Weighted positive matrix factorization (PMF) has been used by scientists to find small sets of underlying factors in environmental data. However, as the size of the data has grown, increasing computational costs have made it impractical to use traditional methods for this factorization. In this paper, we present a new external weighting method to dramatically decrease computational costs for these traditional algorithms. The external weighting scheme, along with the randomized hierarchical alternating least squares (RHALS) algorithm, was applied to the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS 2013) dataset of gaseous highly oxidized multifunctional molecules (HOMs). The modified RHALS algorithm successfully reproduced six previously identified interpretable factors, with the total computation time of the nonoptimized code showing potential improvements of the order of 1 to 2 orders of magnitude compared to competing algorithms. We also investigate rotational ambiguity in the solution and present a simple “pulling” method to rotate a set of factors. This method is shown to find alternative solutions and, in some cases, lower the weighted residual error of the algorithm."

Hilmar Gudmundsson;Jan De Rydt,Coupling framework (1.0) for the Úa (2023b) ice sheet model and the FESOM-1.4 z-coordinate ocean model in an Antarctic domain,"The new coupled ice sheet–ocean model addresses challenges related to horizontal resolution through advanced mesh flexibility, enabled by the use of unstructured grids. We describe the new model, verify its functioning in an idealised setting and demonstrate its advantages in a global-ocean–Antarctic ice sheet domain. The results of this study comprise an important step towards improving predictions of the Antarctic contribution to sea level rise over centennial timescales. 
 The rate at which the Antarctic ice sheet loses mass is to a large degree controlled by ice–ocean interactions underneath small ice shelves, with the most sensitive regions concentrated in even smaller areas near grounding lines and local pinning points. Sufficient horizontal resolution is key to resolving critical ice–ocean processes in these regions but difficult to afford in large-scale models used to predict the coupled response of the entire Antarctic ice sheet and the global ocean to climate change. In this study we describe the implementation of a framework that couples the ice sheet flow model Úa with the Finite Element Sea Ice Ocean Model (FESOM-1.4) in a configuration using depth-dependent vertical coordinates. The novelty of this approach is the use of horizontally unstructured grids in both model components, allowing us to resolve critical processes directly, while keeping computational demands within the range of feasibility. We use the Marine Ice Sheet Ocean Model Intercomparison Project (MISOMIP) framework to verify that ice retreat and readvance are reliably simulated, and inaccuracies in mass, heat and salt conservation are small compared to the forcing signal. Further, we demonstrate the capabilities of our approach for a global ocean–Antarctic ice sheet domain. In a 39-year hindcast simulation (1979–2018) we resolve retreat behaviour of Pine Island Glacier, a known challenge for coarser-resolution models. We conclude that Úa–FESOM is well suited to improve predictions of the Antarctic ice sheet evolution over centennial timescales."

Krol;Mihalis Vrekoussis,Top-down CO emission estimates using TROPOMI CO data in the TM5-4DVAR (r1258) inverse modeling suit,"We estimate carbon monoxide emissions through inverse modeling, an approach where measurements of tracers in the atmosphere are fed to a model to calculate backwards in time (inverse) where the tracers came from. We introduce measurements from a new satellite instrument and show that, in most places globally, these on their own sufficiently constrain the emissions. This alleviates the need for additional datasets, which could shorten the delay for future carbon monoxide source estimates. 
 Carbon monoxide in the atmosphere adversely affects air quality and climate, making knowledge about its sources crucial. However, current global bottom-up emission estimates retain significant uncertainties. In this study, we attempt to reduce these uncertainties by optimizing emission estimates for the second half of the year 2018 on a global scale with a focus on the Northern Hemisphere through the top-down approach of inverse modeling. Specifically, we introduce observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) into the TM5-4DVAR model. The emissions are further constrained using NOAA surface flask measurements. We conducted six experiments to investigate the impact of data use in our inversions, varying the a priori emissions and observational datasets.Notably, the inversion driven by satellite observations alone agrees with flask measurements south of 55° N almost as well as the inversions that included those measurements. This indicates that our method could be suitable for inversions based purely on satellite observations. Compared to the bottom-up estimates, all experiments result in strong (up to 75 %) broad-scale emission reductions in China and India throughout the entire inversion period. Part of the reduction in China can be attributed to policy and technology changes (e.g., coal to gas). Additionally, the OH climatology used to simulate chemical loss appears to be underestimated in that region, which also skews the inversions towards lower emissions. In the experiments that include the surface flask measurements, we find strong localized emission increments over Europe and the Sahara, which are traced back to limitations of the model in reproducing point measurements on mountain tops."

Our model is designed to learn from observational data, with a particular emphasis on understanding the influence of vegetation on water movement. By closely aligning with real-world observations, our model offers new possibilities for enhancing our understanding of the water cycle and its interactions with vegetation. 
 The proposed hybrid hydrological model with vegetation (H2MV) uses dynamic meteorology and static features as input to a long short-term memory (LSTM) to model uncertain parameters of process formulations that govern water fluxes and states. In the hydrological model, vegetation states are represented by the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), and soil storage capacity (SMmax), which depends on effective rooting depth besides soil properties. SMmax and fAPAR are both learned and predicted by the neural networks directly. These parameters have an explicit role to model soil moisture (SM) storage and the partitioning of evapotranspiration (ET). The model is optimized concurrently against global observations and observation-based data of terrestrial water storage (TWS) anomalies, fAPAR, snow water equivalent (SWE), ET, and gridded runoff in a 10-fold cross-validation (CV) setup. To this end, we infer where the model is under-constrained such that different processes could explain the observational constraints in the model due to equifinality. The model reproduces the observed patterns of global hydrological components and fAPAR, while emergent patterns of runoff ratio, evaporative fraction, and the ratio of transpiration to ET are consistent with our current understanding. Despite robustly predicted temporal patterns of TWS anomalies, we found that the mean soil moisture state is not well constrained, causing uncertainty in mean TWS. This emphasizes the importance of SMmax and the necessity for associated enhanced constraints. The proposed model is open-source and has a highly flexible and modular structure to facilitate future integration of carbon and energy cycles, advancing toward a hybrid land surface model."

However, the complex international trade of raw wood materials and HWPs and the associated biogenic carbon conversion along the global supply chain are not properly accounted for in the existing HWP carbon accounting schemes, precluding effective climate policy design. To address the gap, we developed a generalizable Trade-Linked Approach to account for trade and the associated carbon stocks and emissions. In the case study for China-made HWPs in 1990–2020, trade partners supplied 22% (1425 MtCO2e, or 389 MtC) of raw materials and consumed 13% (691 MtCO2e, or 189 MtC) of the HWPs, with the latter double that of the FAOSTAT statistics that were used in the existing studies. In the same period, the trade partners contributed 13% (570 MtCO2e) of the total HWP carbon stocks. The HWPs consumed overseas provided a 43 MtCO2e yr–1 carbon sink (15% of the total) from 2016 to 2020, which is close to the “forest and land use carbon credits” transacted in global voluntary carbon markets in 2020.

Results showed Mn release is negatively correlated with DO (R2 = 0.93, p = 0.034), with oxygen driving reactions between dissolved organic matter (C2 and C3 components) and forming functional groups (−OH, −COOH) that remove Mn through adsorption or complexation (C2: R2 = 0.57, p < 0.001; C3: R2 = 0.53, p < 0.001).

Substantial data support an AOP related to estrogen receptor (ER) antagonism, leading to decreased fecundity in fish. In this study, data were generated for an ER agonism AOP leading to reduced fecundity in avian species (AOP537). Chicken embryos and the chicken leghorn male hepatoma cell line, LMH, were used to elucidate key events associated with estrogen signaling following exposure to 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and bisphenol A (BPA). Embryos were exposed via egg injection. Viability and hepatic estrogen-responsive gene expression data were collected at midincubation (embryonic day [ED] 11). Changes in plasma vitellogenin (VTG), gonad morphology and growth were evaluated prior to pipping (ED20). Both chemicals dysregulated estrogen-responsive genes in hepatic tissue and increased plasma VTG concentrations. In LMH spheroids, EE2 and BPA altered estrogen-responsive genes and VTG concentrations at 24 and 48 h, respectively. Gonadal histology revealed oocyte-type cells and loss of testicular cords in male embryos exposed to EE2 and BPA.

Comprehensive measurements and chemical box model analysis conducted in Hangzhou, China reveal that the formation of O3  is strongly attributed to the increased atmospheric oxidation capacity (AOC). The observed OVOCs contribute 46.5 ± 8.3% to the AOC, especially during the pollution periods, with formaldehyde (HCHO) and acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) accounting for 19 ± 3.8% and 13.8 ± 4.1%, respectively. Various OVOCs (especially CH3CHO) act as  key precursors for the initial production of the crucial radicals. These include the hydroperoxy radical (HO2), methyl peroxy radical (CH3O2), and acetyl peroxy radical (CH3CO3), accounting for 53.7 ± 5.0%, 13.9 ± 2.5%, and 10.0 ± 2.4% of the daytime O3 production (P(O3)), respectively. HCHO acted as the key accelerator of HO2 radical production and subsequently speeded up O3 production. Model simulation and observational evidence reveal that the OVOC initiated secondary channel dominates the HCHO formation. The radical propagation chain of CH3CO3 → CH3O2→ CH3O→ HO2 accounts for 62.4 ± 6.9% of HCHO production. CH3CHO chemistry can account for 14.0% of the production of O3,  and degradation of secondary HCHO derived from CH3CHO accounts for 5.2% of total HO2 production. These findings underscore the significant effect of OVOCs, particularly CH3CHO, on AOC and O3 production in the urban atmosphere in eastern China. Given the decreasing trend of NOX concentration, model simulations under different NOX levels further imply that reducing anthropogenic emission sources of OVOCs is a crucial strategy for current O3 control, and excessive reduction of NOX emissions (the daytime average concentration of NOX decreases to below ∼ 2 ppb) may affect the effectiveness of reducing VOCs and promote a radical self-reaction."

 Five years before the 2022 multi-country mpox outbreak, Nigeria and Cameroon reported their first cases in over three decades.1,2 While Nigeria's outbreak is recognized as an ongoing human epidemic, the drivers of Cameroon's resurgence remain unclear.3,4 The rate of zoonoses remains uncertain in both countries, and gaps in genomic data obscure the timing, zoonotic and geographic origin of mpox virus (MPXV) emergence in humans. To address these uncertainties, we generated 118 MPXV genomes from Nigeria and Cameroon from 2018-2023. Our findings show that, in contrast to Nigeria, cases in Cameroon are the result of repeated zoonoses, with two distinct zoonotic lineages circulating across the Nigeria-Cameroon border. Our findings suggest that shared animal populations in the cross-border forest ecosystems drive virus emergence and spread. Accordingly, we identify the closest zoonotic outgroup to the Nigerian human epidemic lineage (hMPXV-1) in a southern Nigerian border state. We estimate that the shared ancestor of the zoonotic outgroup and hMPXV-1 circulated in animals in southern Nigeria in late 2013. We estimate that hMPXV-1 emerged in humans in August 2014 in the southern Rivers State and circulated undetected for three years. Rivers State acted as the main source of viral spread across the human epidemic. Our study sheds light on MPXV's recent establishment in the human population and highlights the risk of persistent zoonotic emergence of MPXV in the complex border regions of Cameroon and Nigeria."

 Spatially-resolved transcriptomics (SRT) technologies now allow exploration of gene expression with spatial context. Recent advances achieving subcellular resolution provide richer data but also introduce challenges, such as aggregating subcellular spots into individual cells, which is a task distinct from traditional deconvolution. Existing methods often grid SRT data into predefined squares, which is unrealistic for accurately capturing cellular boundaries. We propose a method, STP, that integrates subcellular SRT data with nuclei-stained images to partition individual cells. STP first segments nuclei and maps their masks onto the SRT data, then uses a simulated-annealing-inspired approach to expand nuclear boundaries to the full cellular level. Evaluated on subcellular SRT datasets from Drosophila embryos at multiple developmental stages and from mouse embryos with a large field-of-view, STP demonstrated accurate single-cell partitioning, unveiling significant spatial tissue patterns and identifying undetected cell types beyond previous methods.

Here, the authors reconstruct ancestral karyotypes of Camelinodae and Brassicodae, identify cascading fusions, and highlight their stable inheritance and role in evolutionary relationships. 
 The ancestral crucifer karyotype and 22 conserved genomic blocks (CGBs) facilitate phylogenomic analyses in the Brassicaceae. Chromosomal rearrangements reshuffled CGBs of ancestral chromosomes during karyotype evolution. Here, we identify eight protochromosomes representing the common ancestral karyotype (ACBK) of the two Brassicoideae supertribes: Camelinodae (Lineage I) and Brassicodae (Lineage II). The characterization of multiple cascading fusion events allows us to infer evolutionary relationships based on these events. In the Camelinodae, the ACBK first evolved into the AKI genome, which remained conserved in the Cardamineae, whereas it was altered to tAKI by a reciprocal translocation that preceded the diversification of most Camelinodae tribes. The identified fusion breakpoints largely overlap with CGB boundaries, suggesting that CGBs are mainly disrupted by chromosome fusions. Our results demonstrate the stable inheritance of chromosome fusions and their importance for reconstructing evolutionary relationships. The chromosomal breakpoint approach provides a basis for ancestral state reconstruction based on chromosome-level genome assemblies.

 Basal cell adenoma (BCA) and basal cell adenocarcinoma (BCAC) of the salivary gland are rare tumours that can be difficult to distinguish from each other and other salivary gland tumour subtypes. Using next-generation sequencing, we identify a recurrent FBXW11 missense mutation (p.F517S) in BCA that is mutually exclusive with the previously reported CTNNB1 p.I35T gain-of-function (GoF) mutation with these mutations collectively accounting for 94% of BCAs. In vitro, mutant FBXW11 is characterised by defective binding to β-catenin and higher protein levels within the nucleus. This is consistent with the increased nuclear expression of β-catenin and activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. The genomic profiles of BCAC are distinct from BCA, with hotspot DICER1 and HRAS mutations and putative driver mutations affecting PI3K/AKT and NF-κB signalling pathway genes. These findings have important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of BCA and BCAC, which, despite histopathologic overlap, may be unrelated entities.

 Lipase represents one of the most important industrial biocatalysts, with a global market value of $590.5 million by 2020. However, their catalytic efficiency is often hindered by a closed “lid” conformation. Here, we present an aggregation-induced conformation locking strategy that enables the facile synthesis of highly activated lipase hybrid biocatalysts. Lipase is self-activated into an open-lid conformation via solvent-mediated aggregation, followed by conformational locking within a two-dimensional metal-organic framework (MOF). The resulting MOF biocatalyst provides high accessibility to the locked lipase aggregates through its long-range ordered pore channels, achieving a hydrolytic efficiency 5.30 times greater than that of native lipase. To the best of our knowledge, this represents a record-high activation efficiency for ester hydrolysis among the reported lipase-based hybrid biocatalysts to date. We also demonstrate its feasibility to catalytically accelerate transesterification and esterification reactions, showing up to as 6.64 times higher yield than native lipase and impressive recyclability.

Here the authors show irreversible global glacier loss for centuries after overshoot, implying long-term reductions in glacial water resources with amplified impacts in regions where glaciers regrow. 
 Exceeding 1.5 °C of global warming above pre-industrial levels has become a distinct possibility, yet the consequences of such an overshoot for mountain glaciers and their contribution to raising sea levels and impacting water availability are not well understood. Here we show that exceeding and then returning to below 1.5 °C will have irreversible consequences for glacier mass and runoff over centuries. Global climate and glacier simulations project that a 3.0 °C peak-and-decline scenario will lead to 11% more global glacier mass loss by 2500 compared with limiting warming to 1.5 °C without overshooting. In basins where glaciers regrow after peak temperature, glacier runoff reduces further than if the glaciers stabilize, a phenomenon we call ‘trough water’. Half the studied glaciated basins show reduced glacier runoff with overshoot compared with without for decades to centuries after peak warming. These findings underscore the urgency of near-term emissions reductions and limiting temperature overshoot.

However, here the authors show that some natural climate solution practices tend to lower yields and that maintaining yields lowers the potential GHG mitigation. 
 The assumption that crop-land natural climate solutions (NCS) have benefits for both climate change mitigation and crop production remains largely untested. Here we model GHG emissions and crop yields from crop-land NCS through the end of the century. We find that favourable (win–win) outcomes were the exception not the norm; grass cover crops with no tillage lead to cumulative global GHG mitigation of 32.6 Pg CO2 equivalent, 95% confidence interval (29.5, 35.7), by 2050 but reduce cumulative crop yields by 4.8 Pg, 95% confidence interval (4.0, 5.7). Legume cover crops with no tillage result in favourable outcomes through 2050 but increase GHG emissions for some regions by 2100. Crop-lands with low soil nitrogen and high clay are more likely to have favourable outcomes. Avoiding crop losses, we find modest GHG mitigation benefits from crop-land NCS, 4.4 Pg CO2 equivalent, 95% confidence interval (4.2, 4.6) by 2050, indicating crop-land soil will constitute a fraction of food system decarbonization.

Here the authors use a unique dataset from 164 European forest stands to explore the associations between forest types and well-being. 
 The benefits and risks of forests to human health are widely recognized. Yet, variation across forest types and their ecological characteristics driving health effects remain underexplored. Based on a continental-scale, interdisciplinary empirical database from 164 European forest stands, we constructed a Bayesian Belief Network to quantify seven causal pathways relating distinct forest types to physical and mental health. These forest–health pathways included mental well-being via visual or auditory stimuli, thermal comfort, polyphenol content of medicinal plants, mushrooms and nutrition, air quality, and ticks and Lyme disease. Results show that forests consistently provide net health benefits regardless of their ecological characteristics. Forest canopy density and tree species diversity emerge as key drivers, but their effect size and directionality are strongly pathway-dependent. Changes in forest canopy density can generate trade-offs. For example, forests optimized for heat buffering and air pollution mitigation may compromise medicinal plant yield and enhance Lyme disease prevalence. Tree diversity effects were weaker but more uniformly positive. Therefore, forest management should account for such trade-offs to tailor forest biodiversity and functioning to local public health priorities.

Here the authors use a unique dataset from 164 European forest stands to explore the associations between forest types and well-being."

 The East Asian monsoon (EAM) and the Australian monsoon (AUM), which constitute the two subsystems of the Asian-Australian monsoon system, are dynamically linked through cross-equatorial flows while also responding distinctly to external forcings. Although previous studies have examined their relationships across various timescales, their connection at the orbital timescale remains underexplored. Through a series of simulations, we demonstrate that Australian Summer Monsoon (AUSM) precipitation varies out of phase with East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) precipitation at the precession timescale due to local insolation changes. At the same timescale, the relationship between AUSM circulation and East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) circulation is weak. This weak linkage arises from the precession-induced inter-hemispheric insolation gradient, which diminishes cross-equatorial flow and consequently weakens the dynamical links between AUSM and EAWM circulations."

 Cold events occur in North America (NA) frequently, which pose a significant threat to extensive damage to traffic and agriculture. Research on cold events in NA has mainly focused on the individual impacts of the sea surface temperature (SST) variabilities in the North Pacific and the North Atlantic, with less analysis of their synergistic effect. Here we utilize observational data and numerical experiments to show that the positive North Pacific Victoria mode (VM) and the negative North Tropical Atlantic (NTA) SST exert significant synergistic effects on the winter–spring cold events in eastern NA via Rossby waves propagation. Specifically, the VM-related negative western North Pacific (WNP) SST anomalies are linked to upper-tropospheric wind convergence anomalies in situ, which excite a Rossby wave train from the WNP to the North Atlantic and thus strengthen the high-level negative geopotential height anomalies (GHAs) over eastern NA and the positive air-ocean feedback over the North Atlantic. As a result, the negative GHAs strengthened by the positive VM and negative NTA SST cause increased extreme cold events. Further results reveal that the negative GHAs and cold events in eastern NA during the co-occurrence of the positive VM and negative NTA SST events are more than three times stronger than those for the two kinds of single events. This study suggests that the synergistic effect of the positive VM and negative NTA SST anomalies could advance our comprehensive understanding of the combined effect of the inter-basin SST anomalies on the mid-to-high-latitude climate."

Hagos,Faster recovery of North Atlantic tropical cyclone-induced cold wakes in recent decades,"Faster recovery of North Atlantic tropical cyclone-induced cold wakes in recent decades 
 Intense winds associated with tropical cyclones (TCs) generate surface ocean cooling in their wakes, which can persist for several weeks in their aftermath. While multi-decadal observations of the sea surface have shown a substantial warming of the ocean, long-term changes in cold wake recovery time remain largely unknown. Here we find a trend toward faster recovery of TC cold wakes in the Atlantic main development region (MDR) since 2001. This is due primarily to a decrease in the strength of the North Atlantic trade winds, which reduces evaporative cooling of the ocean. The faster damping of TC cold wakes has led to a significant increase in the intensification of subsequent TCs that encounter lingering wakes from prior TCs, with a magnitude that is about 9% of that from long-term warming of the ocean. Finally, earth system model simulations indicate that the observed decrease in the cold wake recovery time will likely continue into the future."

 Satellite measurements of nitrogen dioxide have been used to infer nitrogen oxide emissions, a critical component in tropospheric chemistry and pollution. New observations from the Geostationary Environmental Monitoring Spectrometer offer a breakthrough by providing a daytime record of nitrogen dioxide over Asia. Here we present the summertime diurnal patterns of nitrogen dioxide at major cities, power plant regions, and the Strait of Malacca. The Geostationary Environmental Monitoring Spectrometer data across various regions show high nitrogen dioxide in the morning which decrease in the afternoon, with varying hourly peaks, troughs, and amplitudes reflecting diurnal characteristics of local emissions and chemistry. Nitrogen oxide emissions inferred from Geostationary Environmental Monitoring Spectrometer and the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry also show distinct patterns among regions: early morning peaks occur over Hanoi, Guangzhou, and Bangkok; mid-to-late morning peaks appear over Seoul and Beijing; and late afternoon peaks are noted in the Yangtze River Delta region. Top-down emissions incorporating temporal changes in the Geostationary Environmental Monitoring Spectrometer nitrogen dioxide yield the most accurate nitrogen dioxide simulations.

 Accurate identification of subsidence funnels is essential for assessing surface deformation in mining areas, preventing disasters, and optimizing resource management. However, recognizing subsidence funnels of varying sizes in large-scale interferograms poses significant challenges, particularly for small-sized funnels. Their indistinct features and susceptibility to background noise interference often result in suboptimal detection accuracy. To address these challenges, this study proposes a deep learning network based on the YOLO architecture—SFD-YOLO (Sinking Funnel Detection-YOLO). The model incorporates the DWR-C2f module, which enhances multi-scale feature extraction and significantly improves the detection of small-sized subsidence funnels. Additionally, the innovative Inner-WIoU regression loss function improves the localization accuracy of detection boxes while also alleviates the imbalance between hard and easy samples. Experimental results demonstrate that the fully trained SFD-YOLO model achieves an mAP50 accuracy of 92.00% while maintaining high efficiency, significantly outperforming other advanced methods. Applying the SFD-YOLO model to interferograms across China detected a total of 3,842 subsidence funnels, with Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, and Anhui identified as the four provinces with the highest funnel number. Overall, subsidence funnels are predominantly distributed in northern and northwestern China. Further analysis and experimental evaluation reveal that the SFD-YOLO model exhibits strong generalization capabilities across complex surface environments nationwide and multi-source satellite data."

 On 8 August 2022, a quasi-stationary mesoscale convective system (MCS) produced prolonged extreme rainfall (> 100 mm h−1) over the Seoul metropolitan area, Republic of Korea. These organized convective systems, primarily composed of convective components with interspersed stratiform elements, are characterized by the successive local generations of convective cells. This study analyzes data from multiple observational platforms to understand the formation of the MCS and its microphysical evolution. The convective cells were initiated just off the west coast near Seoul, along the boundary between warm and cold air masses. Low-level convergence and favorable environmental conditions, including low lifting condensation level, level of free convection, and large convective available potential energy, facilitated the triggering of these cells. As the cells moved inland, they intensified rapidly due to the land-sea surface-friction contrast. Radar data show that as the MCS matured, reflectivity increased and the differential reflectivity decreased downward above the melting level, indicating the growth of ice crystals and graupels. The evolution of microphysical structure led to increases in both the mean diameter (Dm) and the number concentration (NT) of raindrops. This observation also suggests that the rainfall intensity was more closely related to the increase in NT than Dm during the period of heavy downpours. This study improves our understanding of the mesoscale processes related to extreme rainfall in Korea, critical for forecasting local heavy rainfall."
