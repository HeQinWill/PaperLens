10.1088/1748-9326/ad6888,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要研究的是人们的环保行为与主观幸福感之间的关系，以及环保行为对环境影响的程度如何影响这种关系。论文通过元分析方法，发现环保行为与幸福感之间存在微弱的正相关关系，但这种关系只存在于低环境影响的环保行为中，高环境影响的环保行为与幸福感之间没有显著关系。因此，论文认为环保行为与幸福感之间的关系比之前文献描述的更为复杂，环境影响是需要考虑的重要因素。论文的结论对政策制定者具有重要意义，可以帮助他们制定更有效的政策，平衡当前和未来世代的福祉。,[],Laura Krumm,"The relationship between pro-environmental behavior, subjective well-being, and environmental impact: a meta-analysis","A substantial change towards more pro-environmental behavior (PEB) is essential to reach the required reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change. These behavior changes will have consequences on people’s daily lives and thus might affect their well-being. Previous research generally finds positive correlations between PEB and well-being. This meta-analysis explores whether the relationship between PEB and well-being depends on the environmental impact of the performed PEB. Overall, the paper finds a small but significant positive relation between PEB and well-being. When accounting for the environmental impact of the PEB, however, the positive relationship only remains for low-impact PEB. The meta-analysis does not provide any evidence that engaging in high-impact PEB relates to well-being. Consequently, these findings demonstrate that there is more ambiguity in the relationship between PEB and well-being than previously described in the literature and that the environmental impact of PEB matters when evaluating its relationship with well-being. These findings have important implications for policy-making trying to facilitate mitigation efforts that ultimately aim to balance the well-being of the current and future generations."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad6ea7,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究了中亚干旱地区草原对季节性降水亏缺的响应，利用归一化植被指数（NDVI）来评估降水亏缺对草原生长的影响。研究发现，春季的降水亏缺对干旱地区的草原生长影响最大，而夏季的降水亏缺则对半干旱和半湿润地区的草原生长影响最大。这表明，季节性降水亏缺对草原生长的影响存在时间滞后效应，需要考虑前一季度的降水量。这项研究利用卫星遥感技术来监测草原生长状况，并分析了气候变化对草原生态系统的影响。,"['satellite observations', 'NDVI', 'vegetation', 'precipitation', 'drylands', 'climate change']",Ye Yuan;Anming Bao;Cun Chang;Liangliang Jiang;Guoxiong Zheng;Tao Yu;Ping Jiang,Divergent impacts of seasonal precipitation deficiency on grassland growth in drylands of Central Asia,"Water availability and its timing are essential for determining dryland dynamics, and grasslands in Central Asia are particularly vulnerable to water provided by precipitation. Climate change is projected to alter the seasonal distribution of precipitation patterns and increase the frequency of extreme events. Little is known about the response of grasslands to seasonal precipitation deficiency (PD), especially considering the time lag effect. Here, we evaluated the impacts of PD on grassland growth at the seasonal scale based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Our findings showed that grassland growth during spring was mostly affected by PD in arid regions, with PD occurring during the nongrowing season and spring causing mean standardized anomalies (SAs) of −0.83 and −0.54, respectively, for the NDVI. In semiarid and subhumid regions, summer PD caused not only the largest negative response in summer (with SAs of −0.94 and −0.80 for semiarid and subhumid regions, respectively) but also in autumn (−0.80 and −0.74). PD in autumn had a less adverse effect on grassland growth. The divergent seasonal responses primarily stemmed from shifts in the dominant factors influencing grassland growth across seasons. PD reduced soil moisture in spring and summer, which in turn affected grassland growth. However, summer PD affected autumn grassland growth primarily through the carryover effect. Our results highlighted the importance of the timing of PD and suggested that precipitation in the previous season should receive more attention when considering the relationship between vegetation and precipitation at the seasonal scale."

Introducing trees into agricultural systems can positively affect water resources, soil characteristics, biomass and microclimate. We studied an AFS in South Africa in a multidisciplinary approach to assess the different influences and present the resulting dataset consisting of water, soil, tree and meteorological variables. 
 Trees established in linear formations can be utilised as windbreak structures on farms as a form of agroforestry system. We present an extensive data package collected from an active berry farm located near Stellenbosch, South Africa, considering hydrological, pedological, dendrological and meteorological measurements centred around an Italian alder (Alnus cordata (Loisel.) Duby) windbreak and a blackberry (Rubus fruticosus L. Var. “Waldo”) crop. Data were collected between September 2019 and June 2021. The data are available from  Hassler et al. (2024) and include the following measurements (i) meteorological variables – solar radiation, precipitation characteristics, vapour pressure deficit, air temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed and direction, gust speed, and lightning strikes and distance recorded at 10 min intervals; (ii) hydrological measurements – soil moisture and matric potential in two profiles at 15 min intervals alongside soil samples at various depths describing soil texture, hydraulic conductivity, and water retention parameters; (iii) soil characteristics – a soil profile description accompanied by 60 topsoil samples describing carbon, nitrogen, and exchangeable base cation concentrations, as well as potential cation exchange capacity and descriptions of soil texture; and (iv) dendrological measurements – point cloud data for the studied windbreak trees and surrounding features, cylinder models of the windbreak trees with volume and biomass data, and foliage data as a product of an existing leaf creation algorithm. The described dataset provides a multidisciplinary approach to assess the impact and interaction of windbreaks and tree structures in agroforestry landscapes, aiding future work concerning water fluxes, nutrient distribution, microclimate and carbon sequestration. The dataset, including high-resolution time series and point cloud data, offers valuable insights for managing the windbreak's influence and serves as a unique training dataset for spatial analysis (https://doi.org/10.5880/fidgeo.2023.028, Hassler et al., 2024)."

The accuracy – i.e., mean absolute error – improved from 1.28 K to 0.67 K between the seasons thanks to an improved camera setup and temperature stabilization. The dataset represents a major advance in the validation of satellite measurements and physical snow models over a complex topography. 
 The surface temperature of snow cover is a key variable, as it provides information about the current state of the snowpack, helps predict its future evolution, and enhances estimations of the snow water equivalent. Although satellites are often used to measure the surface temperature despite the difficulty of retrieving accurate surface temperatures from space, calibration–validation datasets over snow-covered areas are scarce. We present a dataset of extensive measurements of the surface radiative temperature of snow acquired with an uncooled thermal-infrared (TIR) camera. The set accuracy goal is 0.7 K, which is the radiometric accuracy of the TIR sensor of the future CNES/ISRO TRISHNA mission. TIR images have been acquired over two winter seasons, November 2021 to May 2022 and February to May 2023, at the Col du Lautaret, 2057 m a.s.l. in the French Alps. During the first season, the camera operated in the off-the-shelf configuration with rough thermal regulation (7–39 °C). An improved setup with a stabilized internal temperature was developed for the second campaign, and comprehensive laboratory experiments were carried out in order to characterize the physical properties of the components of the TIR camera and its calibration. Thorough processing, including radiometric processing, orthorectification, and a filter for poor-visibility conditions due to fog or snowfall, was performed. The result is two winter season time series of 130 019 maps of the surface radiative temperature of snow with meter-scale resolution over an area of 0.5 km2. The validation was performed against precision TIR radiometers. We found an absolute accuracy (mean absolute error, MAE) of 1.28 K during winter 2021–2022 and 0.67 K for spring 2023. The efforts to stabilize the internal temperature of the TIR camera therefore led to a notable improvement of the accuracy. Although some uncertainties persist, particularly the temperature overestimation during melt, this dataset represents a major advance in the capacity to monitor and map surface temperature in mountainous areas and to calibrate–validate satellite measurements over snow-covered areas of complex topography.

10.5194/gmd-17-6513-2024,False,Geoscientific Model Development,该研究主要关注珊瑚礁的碳酸盐生产对全球碳循环和大气CO2浓度的影响。研究人员将珊瑚礁碳酸盐生产模块整合到一个气候模型中，并通过模拟珊瑚礁的生长和碳酸盐生产来评估其对气候变化的影响。研究中使用了气候模型和珊瑚礁碳酸盐生产模型，但没有涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析。,"['coral reefs', 'carbon cycle', 'climate model', 'carbonate production', 'atmospheric CO2', 'aragonite saturation state']",Nathaelle Bouttes;Lester Kwiatkowski;Manon Berger;Victor Brovkin;Guy Munhoven,Implementing the iCORAL (version 1.0) coral reef CaCO3 production module in the iLOVECLIM climate model,"Coral reefs are crucial for biodiversity, but they also play a role in the carbon cycle on long time scales of a few thousand years. To better simulate the future and past evolution of coral reefs and their effect on the global carbon cycle, hence on atmospheric CO2 concentration, it is necessary to include coral reefs within a climate model. Here we describe the inclusion of coral reef carbonate production in a carbon–climate model and its validation in comparison to existing modern data. 
 Coral reef development is intricately linked to both climate and the concentration of atmospheric CO2, specifically through temperature and carbonate chemistry in the upper ocean. In turn, the calcification of corals modifies the concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity in the ocean, impacting air–sea gas exchange, atmospheric CO2 concentration, and ultimately the climate. This feedback between atmospheric conditions and coral biogeochemistry can only be accounted for with a coupled coral–carbon–climate model. Here we present the implementation of a coral reef calcification module into an Earth system model. Simulated coral reef production of the calcium carbonate mineral aragonite depends on photosynthetically active radiation, nutrient concentrations, salinity, temperature, and the aragonite saturation state. An ensemble of 210 parameter perturbation simulations was performed to identify carbonate production parameter values that optimize the simulated distribution of coral reefs and associated carbonate production. The tuned model simulates the presence of coral reefs and regional-to-global carbonate production values in good agreement with data-based estimates, despite some limitations due to the imperfect simulation of climatic and biogeochemical fields driving the simulation of coral reef development. When used in association with methods accounting for bathymetry changes resulting from different sea levels, the model enables assessment of past and future coral–climate coupling on seasonal to millennial timescales, highlighting how climatic trends and variability may affect reef development and the resulting climate–carbon feedback."

Only a few complex models exist to simulate this phenomenon, and the respective hazard is hard to predict. This work provides a novel flow model that focuses on simple relations while still encapsulating the significant behaviour. The model is applied to reconstruct two catastrophic powder snow avalanche events in Austria. 
 Numerical simulations have become an important tool for the estimation and mitigation of gravitational mass flows, such as avalanches, landslides, pyroclastic flows, and turbidity currents. Depth integration stands as a pivotal concept in rendering numerical models applicable to real-world scenarios, as it provides the required efficiency and a streamlined workflow for geographic information systems. In recent years, a large number of flow models were developed following the idea of depth integration, thereby enlarging the applicability and reliability of this family of process models substantially. It has been previously shown that the finite area method of OpenFOAM® can be utilized to express and solve the basic depth-integrated models representing incompressible dense flows. In this article, previous work (Rauter et al., 2018) is extended beyond the dense-flow regime to account for suspended particle flows, such as turbidity currents and powder snow avalanches. A novel coupling mechanism is introduced to enhance the simulation capabilities for mixed-snow avalanches. Further, we will give an updated description of the revised computational framework, its integration into OpenFOAM, and interfaces to geographic information systems. This work aims to provide practitioners and scientists with an open-source tool that facilitates transparency and reproducibility and that can be easily applied to real-world scenarios. The tool can be used as a baseline for further developments and in particular allows for modular integration of customized process models."

A limiting factor is the supercomputers at hand and how best to utilize them. This study focuses on the refactorization of one part of a sea ice model (CICE), namely the dynamics. It shows that the performance can be significantly improved, which means that one can either run the same simulations much cheaper or advance the system according to what is needed. 
 This study focuses on the performance of the elastic–viscous–plastic (EVP) dynamical solver within the sea ice model, CICE v6.5.1. The study has been conducted in two steps. First, the standard EVP solver was extracted from CICE for experiments with refactored versions, which are used for performance testing. Second, one refactored version was integrated and tested in the full CICE model to demonstrate that the new algorithms do not significantly impact the physical results.The study reveals two dominant bottlenecks,  namely (1) the number of Message Parsing Interface (MPI) and Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) synchronization points required for halo exchanges during each time step combined with the irregular domain of active sea ice points and (2) the lack of single-instruction, multiple-data (SIMD) code generation.The standard EVP solver has been refactored based on two generic patterns. The first pattern exposes how general finite differences on masked multi-dimensional arrays can be expressed in order to produce significantly better code generation by changing the memory access pattern from random access to direct access. The second pattern takes an alternative approach to handle static grid properties.The measured single-core performance improvement is more than a factor of 5 compared to the standard implementation. The refactored implementation of strong scales on the Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors series node until the available bandwidth of the node is used. For the Intel® Xeon® CPU Max series, there is sufficient bandwidth to allow the strong scaling to continue for all the cores on the node, resulting in a single-node improvement factor of 35 over the standard implementation. This study also demonstrates improved performance on GPU processors."

However, the notorious accumulation of polychlorinated species and excessively strong NH3 adsorption on the catalysts lead to the deterioration of multipollutant control (MPC) activity. Herein, protonated sulfate (−HSO4) supported on vanadium-titanium catalysts via a preoccupied anchoring strategy are designed to prevent polychlorinated species and alleviate NH3 adsorption for the multipollutant control. The obtained catalysts with −HSO4 modification achieve an excellent NOx and CB conversion with turnover frequency values of ∼ 3.63 and 17.7 times higher than those of the pristine, respectively. The protonated sulfate promotes the formation of polymeric vanadyl with a higher chemical state and d-band center of V. The modulated catalysts not only substantially alleviate the competitive adsorption of multipollutant via the “V 3d–O 2p–S 3p” network, but also distinctly strengthen the Brønsted acid sites. Besides, the introduced proton donor of the −HSO4 connecting polymeric structure could markedly reduce the reaction barrier of breaking the C–Cl bond. This work paves an advanced way for low-loading vanadium SCR catalysts to achieve highly efficient NOx and CB oxidation at a low temperature."

We conduct controlled numerical experiments with the Thermosphere‐Ionosphere Electrodynamic General Circulation Model (TIEGCM). Coulomb collisional heat flux derived with the Comprehensive Inner Magnetosphere Ionosphere (CIMI) model and empirical subauroral polarization streams (SAPS) are implemented in TIEGCM. The heat flux causes electron temperature enhancement, electron density depletion, and consequently SAR arcs formed in the dusk‐to‐midnight subauroral ionosphere region. SAPS cause more substantial plasma and neutral heating and plasma density variations in a broader region. The maximum enhancement of subauroral red line emission rate is comparable to that caused by the heat flux.

It was shown that the intensity and periodicity of the ISPNA was much stronger and slightly longer in La Niña winters than in the El Niño winters. The phase‐locked association between the ISPNA and MJO indicate that this skewness was controlled by the MJO. The northward Rossby wave activities derived from the tropics associated with the MJO to the subtropical Pacific sector of the ISPNA clarified that the stronger intensity of the MJO convection in the western Pacific during the La Niña winters, as well as the slower eastward propagation of the MJO, led to the asymmetric intensity and period of the ISPNA in the two ENSO phases."

 Gold nuggets occur predominantly in quartz veins, and the current paradigm posits that gold precipitates from dilute (<1 mg kg−1 gold), hot, water ± carbon dioxide-rich fluids owing to changes in temperature, pressure and/or fluid chemistry. However, the widespread occurrence of large gold nuggets is at odds with the dilute nature of these fluids and the chemical inertness of quartz. Quartz is the only abundant piezoelectric mineral on Earth, and the cyclical nature of earthquake activity that drives orogenic gold deposit formation means that quartz crystals in veins will experience thousands of episodes of deviatoric stress. Here we use quartz deformation experiments and piezoelectric modelling to investigate whether piezoelectric discharge from quartz can explain the ubiquitous gold–quartz association and the formation of gold nuggets. We find that stress on quartz crystals can generate enough voltage to electrochemically deposit aqueous gold from solution as well as accumulate gold nanoparticles. Nucleation of gold via piezo-driven reactions is rate-limiting because quartz is an insulator; however, since gold is a conductor, our results show that existing gold grains are the focus of ongoing growth. We suggest this mechanism can help explain the creation of large nuggets and the commonly observed highly interconnected gold networks within quartz vein fractures.

 Wildfire activity in Arctic and boreal regions is rapidly increasing, with severe consequences for climate and human health. Regional long-term variations in fire frequency and intensity characterize fire regimes. The spatial variability in Arctic–boreal fire regimes and their environmental and anthropogenic drivers, however, remain poorly understood. Here we present a fire tracking system to map the sub-daily evolution of all circumpolar Arctic–boreal fires between 2012 and 2023 using 375 m Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite active fire detections and the resulting dataset of the ignition time, location, size, duration, spread and intensity of individual fires. We use this dataset to classify the Arctic–boreal biomes into seven distinct ‘pyroregions’ with unique climatic and geographic environments. We find that these pyroregions exhibit varying responses to environmental drivers, with boreal North America, eastern Siberia and northern tundra regions showing the highest sensitivity to climate and lightning density. In addition, anthropogenic factors play an important role in influencing fire number and size, interacting with other factors. Understanding the spatial variability of fire regimes and its interconnected drivers in the Arctic–boreal domain is important for improving future predictions of fire activity and identifying areas at risk for extreme events.

 Thermoelectrics converting heat and electricity directly attract broad attentions. To enhance the thermoelectric figure of merit, zT, one of the key points is to decouple the carrier-phonon transport. Here, we propose an entropy engineering strategy to realize the carrier-phonon decoupling in the typical SrTiO3-based perovskite thermoelectrics. By high-entropy design, the lattice thermal conductivity could be reduced nearly to the amorphous limit, 1.25 W m−1 K−1. Simultaneously, entropy engineering can tune the Ti displacement, improving the weighted mobility to 65 cm2 V−1 s−1. Such carrier-phonon decoupling behaviors enable the greatly enhanced μW/κL of ~5.2 × 103 cm3 K J−1 V−1. The measured maximum zT of 0.24 at 488 K and the estimated zT of ~0.8 at 1173 K in (Sr0.2Ba0.2Ca0.2Pb0.2La0.2)TiO3 film are among the best of n-type thermoelectric oxides.

 Climate warming disproportionately impacts countries in the Global South by increasing extreme heat exposure. However, geographic disparities in adaptation capacity are unclear. Here, we assess global inequality in green spaces, which urban residents critically rely on to mitigate outdoor heat stress. We use remote sensing data to quantify daytime cooling by urban greenery in the warm seasons across the ~500 largest cities globally. We show a striking contrast, with Global South cities having ~70% of the cooling capacity of cities in the Global North (2.5 ± 1.0 °C vs. 3.6 ± 1.7 °C). A similar gap occurs for the cooling adaptation benefits received by an average resident in these cities (2.2 ± 0.9 °C vs. 3.4 ± 1.7 °C). This cooling adaptation inequality is due to discrepancies in green space quantity and quality between cities in the Global North and South, shaped by socioeconomic and natural factors.

 The discovery of valuable minerals in the mineral-abundant eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo can stimulate extensive migration into remote areas of the Congo Basin rainforest. Despite the widespread practice of artisanal mining, its role in the ongoing deforestation has not received adequate attention. Using difference-in-differences estimation, we show that artisanal mining triggers deforestation at least 5 km from mining sites. Within this distance, the onset of mining causes an additional 4 percentage points of forest loss after 10 years. In total, the indirect deforestation caused by mining through the expansion of other land uses is 28 times larger than the forest area directly cleared for mining. Most of this loss is caused by increased farming around mines, followed by forest cleared for settlements. These indirect effects reveal a much larger role played by artisanal mining in deforestation dynamics than previously assumed and explain at least 6.6% of the total deforestation in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.

 Despite the profound societal impacts of intense tropical cyclones (TCs), prediction of future changes in their regional occurrence remains challenging owing to climate model limitations and to the infrequent occurrence of such TCs. Here we reveal projected changes in the frequency of major TC occurrence (i.e., maximum sustained wind speed: ≥ 50 m s−1) on the regional scale. Two independent high-resolution climate models projected similar changes in major TC occurrence. Their spatial patterns highlight an increase in the Central Pacific and a reduction in occurrence in the Southern Hemisphere—likely attributable to anthropogenic climate change. Furthermore, this study suggests that major TCs can modify large-scale sea-level pressure fields, potentially leading to the abrupt onset of strong wind speeds even when the storm centers are thousands of kilometers away. This study highlights the amplified risk of storm-related hazards, specifically in the Central Pacific, even when major TCs are far from the populated regions.

 Paleotsunami deposits provide a compelling record of these events, including valuable insights into their recurrence and associated magnitudes. However, precisely determining the sources of these sedimentary evidence remains challenging due to the complex interplay between hydrodynamic and geological phenomena and the intricacy of the processes responsible for forming and preserving tsunami deposits. Here, we introduce a novel approach that employs Bayesian inference methods to divide the complex tsunami process into segments and independently handle uncertainties, thereby enabling more precise and comprehensive modelling of the sources. We provide a list of potential earthquake scenarios with different likelihoods instead of a single best fit. Based on this method, we calculated that the source of the 869 Jogan earthquake had a magnitude ranging from Moment Magnitude 8.84 to 9.1 (within one standard deviation) with different slip distributions along the Japan Trench. Our results reaffirm that the Jogan event had a similar order of magnitude to the 2011 Tohoku-oki tsunami and enhanced the applicability of paleotsunami deposits to hazard assessment.

 Some of the largest magmatic-hydrothermal copper ore deposits and deposit clusters are associated with arc-oblique fault systems. Whether this structural context impacts the geochemistry of hydrothermal fluids, including their copper contents, remains unknown. Here, we investigate the copper concentration and helium isotope signature of geothermal fluids as modern analogs of hydrothermal ore deposits in the Andes of central-southern Chile. We show that fault systems broadly parallel to the regional stress field facilitate the early release of fluids from deep primitive magmas. By contrast, fault systems oblique to the regional stress field prevent the early escape of fluids and promote magmatic enrichment in copper, volatiles, and ligands, enhancing the potential to form copper deposits. We conclude that the orientation of fault systems actively influences the copper budget of ascending hydrothermal fluids, explaining the contrasting distribution of metals along distinct structures often observed in porphyry-epithermal systems and other types of magmatic-hydrothermal deposits. The enrichment of copper in magmatic hydrothermal fluids is influenced by the orientation of fault systems in arcs, according to geochemical analyses of gases and hot spring waters from active fumarole fields in the Southern Volcanic Zone of Chile."

 In subduction zones, water expelled from the subducting slab is believed to be involved in seismic activity. However, little is known about its quantity and flow processes. Here, we show that the Arima hot springs in western Japan contain high concentrations of water derived from the subducting Philippine Sea slab. A long-term record spanning over half a century reveals that the fraction of slab-derived water exhibited a temporary surge in the year preceding and/or subsequent years of the 1995 Kobe (Hyogo-ken Nanbu) earthquake. In total, an estimated 2.6–4.2 × 105 cubic meters of slab-derived water was introduced in conjunction with the earthquake. We infer that the earthquake was triggered by a flood-like release of water from the slab or by the bursting of clogged flow paths to the hypocenter. Our findings highlight the importance of hydrologically slab-connected hot springs for understanding ultradeep water cycles and their causal relationships with seismic phenomena. Water expelled from subducting slabs has a strong control over seismic events, with changes in hot spring water chemistry recording the surge of slab derived water, according to geochemical studies of water samples from the Arima hot springs, Japan."

10.1016/j.jag.2024.104120,False,International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation,该研究主要关注北太平洋海面二氧化碳浓度（pCO2）的时空分布及其影响因素。研究利用时空加权神经网络模型（GSTNNWR）对北太平洋海面pCO2进行高精度预测，并通过量化分析识别了影响pCO2的潜在环境机制。研究中使用了海面温度、叶绿素浓度和盐度等海洋数据，并通过卫星观测获取了相关数据。虽然研究涉及卫星观测，但主要侧重于海洋环境，而非大气环境遥感技术。,"['surface seawater pCO2', 'North Pacific Ocean', 'carbon cycle', 'satellite observations', 'oceanographic data', 'remote sensing']",Yi Liu;Yijun Chen;Zihang Huang;Haoxuan Liang;Jin Qi;Sensen Wu;Zhenhong Du,Spatiotemporal weighted neural network reveals surface seawater pCO<sub>2</sub> distributions and underlying environmental mechanisms in the North Pacific Ocean,"•A new explainable spatiotemporal intelligent regression model − GSTNNWR was purposed. •Monthly high-precision distribution of surface pCO2 in the North Pacific Ocean were obtained. •Underlying environmental mechanisms affecting surface pCO2 have been identified through quantitative analysis. 
 The North Pacific Ocean plays a pivotal role as a carbon sink within the global carbon cycle. However, a comprehensive understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of carbon dioxide concentration and its determinants in this domain remains elusive due to its vast dimensions and the intricacies of influencing factors, with previous research on carbon dioxide partial pressure in the North Pacific Ocean also being relatively scarce. While prevalent machine learning methodologies have been extensively applied to predict the partial pressure of ocean carbon dioxide (pCO2), their limited interpretability has impeded substantial progress in elucidating the underlying mechanisms. This study introduces a gridded spatiotemporal neural network weighted regression (GSTNNWR) model to illuminate temporal and spatial relationships among relevant environmental variables and pCO2. The GSTNNWR model achieves high-precision and high-resolution forecasts of surface pCO2 in the North Pacific Ocean, demonstrating commendable performance (R2 = 0.863 and RMSE=15.123 µatm). Simultaneously, we obtain a quantitative characterization of how various environmental factors influence pCO2 across different temporal and spatial scales. Results show a dominant positive effect of temperature on the pCO2, with an averaged normalized coefficient of 0.28, and variability in the effects of chlorophyll and salinity on the pCO2 at different spatial and temporal locations and temperatures, whose average normalized coefficients are −0.10 and −0.04.The findings of our study will provide insights into the mechanisms and interactions within the North Pacific carbon cycle, contributing to a better understanding of ocean carbon sink formation and the dynamic regulation of the North Pacific carbon cycle."
