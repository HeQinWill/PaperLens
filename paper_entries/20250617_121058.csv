10.1088/1748-9326/addf60,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注海洋增强风化（mERW）技术，通过在海洋环境中添加橄榄石等矿物来提高海水的碱度，从而增加二氧化碳的吸收能力。论文通过一个空间模型，以法国沿海地区为例，量化了 mERW 的碳移除潜力。虽然该研究与二氧化碳的封存有关，但它主要集中在海洋环境中的地球化学过程，而不是大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。因此，它与大气环境遥感技术的关联性较弱。,"['CO2 sequestration', 'Ocean alkalinity enhancement', 'Marine enhanced rock weathering', 'Carbon dioxide removal']",Luna J J Geerts;Astrid Hylén;Filip J R Meysman,The CDR potential of olivine-based enhanced rock weathering in marine systems: a case study for the coastal zone of France,"Marine enhanced rock weathering (mERW) is proposed as a method to achieve ocean alkalinity enhancement, thus increasing the CO2 storage capacity of seawater. Deposition of minerals in shallow waters results in enhanced dissolution rates via the ‘benthic weathering engine’, thus inducing an additional alkalinity release from the seabed on top of the natural alkalinity efflux. However, the application potential of mERW as a carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technology remains uncertain. Here, we quantified the CDR potential via mERW through a spatially explicit model, using the coastal zone of France as a case study. We simulated the one-time addition of dunite (olivine-rich source rock) distinguishing between three sediment types: bedload, permeable, and cohesive seafloor environments. The average CO2 sequestration rate was estimated at 0.32 kg CO2 m–2 seafloor kg–1 dunite over 100 yr. The sediment type was identified as the most important factor governing the CO2 sequestration rate, as it critically constrains the olivine dissolution kinetics. Coarse sediments exposed to bedload transport provide the highest CO2 sequestration rates. The application area was restricted to the territorial seas of mainland France (12 nautical miles offshore), and we estimated that 45% of this zone is suited for mERW. This area is further reduced to 23% when nature conservation areas are excluded from application. Assuming a dunite (olivine-rich mineral) loading of 20 kg m–2 seafloor, the CO2 sequestration capacity over 100 yr for the entire mERW area in France is estimated to be 210 Mt. As such, mERW will not be able to cover the entire CDR need for a country like France but could be one technology in a larger portfolio of CDR techniques. Our model analysis identifies a number of uncertainties and knowledge gaps in the assessment of the mERW potential."

This study provides a comprehensive analysis of land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes with a focus on forest cover changes in Huế, central Vietnam, over the period from 1988 to 2022. Huế is a region of ecological and cultural significance, home to diverse forest ecosystems that play a critical role in water regulation, flood mitigation, and soil stabilization. The province’s forests also support rich biodiversity and provide vital resources for local livelihoods. By leveraging time-series Landsat observations and employing the continuous change detection and classification—spectral mixture analysis method, we synthesized multi-decadal geospatial data to track and categorize forest dynamics. The results indicate substantial LULC changes, highlighted by a significant reduction in stable forest cover from 58.3% in 1993 to 48.9% in 2022, accompanied by an increase in degraded forests from 11.7% to 18.0%. Peak forest loss was recorded at 1.5% by the end of 2013. The study discusses economic expansion, infrastructure development, climate variability, and agricultural intensification as key drivers of forest cover change. The findings underscore the importance of sustainable land management practices and provide actionable insights to inform policy development, particularly in regions with complex socio-economic and ecological interactions."

AU is thus considered a marine carbon dioxide removal option among other potential uses. Due to the typical temperature and salinity depth profiles in wide parts of the oceans, a self-sustaining up or downflow within a vertical pipe can be established. This concept was introduced by Stommel et al (1956 Deep Sea Res.3 152–3) as the perpetual salt fountain. Using a one-dimensional numerical performance prediction method for Stommel upwelling pipe (SUP) systems, previously developed and verified by Kemper et al (2025 Appl. Ocean Res.160 104624), several studies on the potential of the SUP concept for AU are reported in the present work. A global assessment of the AU potential of SUP systems is presented, and the spatial and temporal variability of their performance is discussed. Additionally, an overview of upscaling and optimization design considerations for SUP systems is given based on a parametric study. Our results show that considerable parts of the global oceans are suitable for SUP-based AU of nutrients. The highest potential is found in the subtropical ocean gyres. We further find a significant seasonal pattern in the upwelling velocity. Upscaling of SUP systems to achieve practically significant flow rates for AU is found possible."
10.1088/1748-9326/ade16e,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇研究论文主要关注全球变暖对南美洲南大西洋辐合带（SACZ）中热带-温带云带的影响，特别是极端降雨事件的频率和强度。研究使用高分辨率气候模拟来预测未来在SACZ区域内强降雨集群的增加，以及由此可能导致的洪水、滑坡等灾害风险。虽然论文涉及大气现象，但其重点在于气候变化的影响和预测，而非大气环境遥感技术本身，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['rainfall extremes', 'South Atlantic convergence zone (SACZ)', 'tropical-extratropical cloud bands', 'convection-permitting simulations', 'climate change', 'flooding risk']",Marcia T Zilli;Neil C G Hart;Kate Halladay;Ron Kahana,Threefold increase in most intense South Atlantic convergence zone events by 2100 in convection-permitting simulation,"Unprecedented rainfall extremes resulting from global warming are becoming more frequent each year, including over South America. In this region, tropical-extratropical (TE) cloud bands in the South Atlantic convergence zone (SACZ) produce most of the rainy season precipitation. In this study, we diagnose the impacts of warming on the frequency and intensification of SACZ TE cloud bands. The cloud bands are identified using a feature-detection algorithm applied to a suite of convection-permitting simulations produced by the UK Met Office. Intensely raining clusters embedded within these large-scale cloud bands are diagnosed in order to identify the most intense events. Although the total number of cloud-band days will see a 20%–30% decrease in their frequency under high-emission global warming, the present day 1-in-5 most intense cloud-band days will happen every 3-in-5 cloud-band days in the future. Therefore, despite fewer cloud-band days occurring in a given year, when they form they will frequently be more intense than is typical in the current climate. This increase is primarily due to warming-driven intensification of rain rates within the heavily raining clusters embedded in these weather systems. These results highlight the growing risk of intense SACZ rainfall over South America under warming, increasing the likelihood of flash floods, landslides, and unprecedented catchment-scale fluvial flooding."
10.1088/1748-9326/ade170,True,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文利用卫星遥感技术反演中国城市尺度的氮氧化物（NOX）排放量，分析了2012年至2020年间不同规模城市NOX排放的变化趋势。研究发现，与大型城市相比，小型和中型城市的NOX排放量下降幅度较小，甚至部分小型城市排放量有所增加。这种城市间排放差异的变化趋势，传统的自下而上的排放清单难以反映。该研究强调了基于卫星高分辨率反演技术在追踪城市尺度排放量，从而支持有针对性的排放控制方面的重要价值。,"['Nitrogen oxides (NOX)', 'Satellite-based inversion', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Emission changes', 'High-resolution PHLET inversion']",Hao Kong;Jintai Lin;Ruijing Ni;Mingxi Du;Jingxu Wang;Lulu Chen;Chenghao Xu;Yingying Yan;Hongjian Weng;Yuhang Zhang,Satellite detected weak decline of nitrogen oxides emissions in economically small cities of China,"Nitrogen oxides (NOX = NO + NO2) are a major air pollutant under stringent emission regulation in China. The nation has effectively cut its total anthropogenic emission since the peaking around 2012, with cities at the forefront of implementing mitigation measures. However, the city-level emission changes and cross-city contrast remains poorly understood, due to inaccuracies in existing emission data. Using the satellite-based high-resolution PHLET inversion, we derived city-level NOX emissions in China from 2012 to 2020. We found much weaker emission declines in small cities (by 14.7% from 2012–2014 mean to 2018–2020 mean, for the bottom one-third of cities ordered by economic volumes) and medium cities (by 21.3%, for the middle one-third), compared to those in large cities (by 30.6%, for the top one-third) and provincial capital cities in the North Region of China (by 54.2%). Emissions even grew in 43.0% of small cities, compared to 17.4% for large cities. Cross-city emission differences both within each province and among the provinces decreased substantially over time, resulting in a relative shift of emission burdens towards small and medium cities. Such a tendency is hardly resolved by bottom–up emission inventories, highlighting the value of satellite-based high-resolution inversion for tracking city-level emissions to support targeted emission control."

Traffic-related sources are the largest contributor to NMHC concentrations in Marseille, and shipping strongly contributes to the formation of aerosols. Finally, the Covid-19 lockdown had an impact on NMHC concentrations, reaching a 50 % decrease for traffic-related sources. 
 Long-term measurements of volatile organic compound (VOC) concentrations are crucial to improve our knowledge about their role in atmospheric chemistry, especially in regions with high photochemistry, such as the Mediterranean Basin. A field measurement campaign of 18 months has been conducted in Marseille from March 2019 to August 2020 with online measurements of C2 to C16 non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) using two thermal desorber–gas chromatography–flame ionization detector (TD-GC-FID) instruments. The positive matrix factorization model has been applied to this dataset for each season. Six yearlong factors were identified (traffic exhaust, fuel evaporation, industrial sources, shipping, regional and local urban backgrounds, and IVOCs), and two  seasonal factors were identified  (biogenic sources in summer and residential heating during cold periods).Traffic (exhaust and evaporation) is the largest contributor to  measured NMHC concentrations, with a relative contribution of about 40 %, with the exception of spring 2020, where the relative contribution was only 25 %. The potential contribution of each factor to secondary pollutant formation has been evaluated. Results reveal that the shipping source is potentially one of the most important contributors to secondary organic aerosol formation potential, despite the low contribution of this factor to NMHC concentrations.The impact of the lockdown due to Covid-19 is clearly visible across all sources, especially the traffic source. The contribution of this source decreased by half during spring 2020 in comparison with other seasons.A comparison of these results with emission inventories may be useful to evaluate their accuracy for a better understanding of the atmospheric pollution occurring in Marseille."

N. Power;Aldona Wiacek,"On path length, beam divergence, and retroreflector array size in open-path FTIR spectroscopy","The choice of path length and retroreflector array size in open-path Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy must be made with care.  Longer paths increase target gas absorption (lowering detection limits), and larger retroreflector arrays increase the return signal (improving retrieved concentration precision), but there are limitations to both. An optimum array size and path combination exists in each specific observational environment and application, as explored in this work. 
 Open-path Fourier transform infrared (OP-FTIR) spectroscopy is an established technique used to measure boundary layer trace gas concentrations, consisting (in this work) of a spectrometer with an active mid-IR source coupled to a single transmitting and receiving telescope, as well as a cube-corner retroreflector array separated from the spectrometer and telescope by an atmospheric path. The detection limit at first increases with increasing optical path length (OPL) in the atmosphere, which controls target gas spectral absorption depth; however, open-path beam divergence can lead to overfilling of the distant retroreflector array for separations greater than ∼ 150 m (OPL ∼ 300 m; the details depend on specifics of spectrometer and telescope optics, plus array size), resulting in decreased returning radiation at the detector. In this case, the absorption signature of the target gas increases, but the signal-to-noise ratio of the recorded spectrum decreases. We present the results of theoretical spectral simulations for formaldehyde (HCHO) that show how path length, interfering water concentration, and HCHO target concentration affect the expected differential absorption spectrum of the HCHO target at 1 ppb. HCHO serves as a proxy for any low-abundance trace gas with relatively weak absorption features, which makes it sensitive to changes in the performance and setup of the OP-FTIR system, as explored in this study. We demonstrate that optical path lengths  >∼ 300 m are necessary for robust HCHO spectral signatures (at our typical random plus systematic noise levels). Next, we present the results of two field experiments where the retroreflector array area was increased to collect a larger fraction of returning radiation, at two-way path lengths ranging from 50 to 1300 m. We confirm that the larger retroreflector array resulted in a slower decrease in the signal as a function of optical path length. Finally, we perform retrievals of HCHO concentrations from spectra collected at the same field site and path length in Halifax Harbour during 2018 and 2021, with a smaller and a larger retroreflector array, respectively. We demonstrate that retrievals based on larger retroreflector array spectra exhibit ∼2× higher precision (average standard deviation in hourly formaldehyde data bins over 2 d), even though systematic errors remain in the fitted spectra, due to water vapour. Where systematic fitting errors in interfering species (e.g., water) are significant, a longer path may not be optimal for a given target gas, leading instead to biased retrievals; moreover, at very long optical path lengths the signal-to-noise ratio decreases with increasing water vapour due to broadband mid-IR spectrum signal reduction in water-saturated regions. We discuss factors to consider in the choice of path length and retroreflector array size in open-path FTIR spectroscopy, which must be made with care."

Gijsbert Tilstra;David P. Donovan;Gerd-Jan van Zadelhoff;J. Pepijn Veefkind,Improvements in aerosol layer height retrievals from TROPOMI oxygen A-band measurements by surface albedo fitting in optimal estimation,"The aerosol layer height (ALH) from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) has been constantly improved since its release in 2019. Over bright surfaces, fitting the albedo improved the retrieval, as shown for a set of situations, ranging from multiple layers of smoke to thick desert dust plumes and low-altitude industrial pollution. The latest results of the operational ALH are compared to profiles from the ATmospheric LIDar (ATLID) on board the recently launched EarthCARE mission. 
 The aerosol layer height (ALH), from the Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI L2_AER_LH product, is based on an optimal estimation (OE) approach, fitting cloud-free measurements to synthetic reflectances in the strongest oxygen absorption band, provided by a neural network trained with high-resolution simulated reflectances. The ALH has been continuously improved since its release in 2019, focusing especially on (bright) land surfaces, over which the ALH product showed  underestimated ALHs (biased towards the surface).  This paper describes the latest updates of the ALH product, which includes first the introduction of the directional Lambertian-equivalent reflectance (DLER) climatology to improve the surface albedo characterization over land. Second, the paper describes a further improvement, adding the surface albedo in the feature vector of the OE inversion, using the DLER as prior information. Using this approach, the retrievals over land largely match the retrievals over ocean, which have shown a good comparison with validation data since its release, most notably with Cloud-Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) weighted extinction heights. The albedo is fitted for both land and ocean surfaces, but the implementation is different over land and ocean because of the large range of land surface albedos. Over land, the a priori surface albedo values are relaxed so the fitting procedure can incorporate the albedo effects in the retrieval over land. Over ocean, the retrievals are optimized by tuning the a priori error settings. The current implementation improves retrievals over land with approximately 1.5 times more converged results and decreases land–ocean contrasts in the ALH retrievals. The average difference between CALIOP weighted extinction height decreased for selected cases from approximately −1.9 to −0.9 km over land and from approximately −0.8 to +0.1 km over ocean. An independent verification with ATmospheric LIDar (ATLID) data from EarthCARE showed consistent behaviour between the new operational data and the test cases."

 Recent global fire activity has highlighted the importance of understanding fire dynamics across time and space, with records of past fire (palaeofire) providing valuable insights to inform us on current and future management challenges.

 The turnover time (τ) of global soil organic carbon is central to the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Yet our spatially explicit understanding of the depth-dependent variations and environmental controls of τ at a global scale remains incomplete. In this study, we combine multiple state-of-the-art observation-based datasets, including over 90 000 geo-referenced soil profiles, the latest root observations distributed globally, and large numbers of satellite-derived environmental variables, to generate global maps of apparent τ in topsoil (0–0.3 m) and subsoil (0.3–1 m) layers, with a spatial resolution of 30 arcsec (∼1 km at the Equator). We show that subsoil τ (385203485 years (mean, with a variation range from the 2.5th to 97.5th percentile)) is over 8 times longer than topsoil τ (1511137 years). The cross-validation shows that the fitted machine learning models effectively captured the variabilities in τ, with R2 values of 0.87 and 0.70 for topsoil and subsoil τ mapping, respectively. The prediction uncertainties of the τ maps were quantified for better user applications. The environmental controls on topsoil and subsoil τ were investigated at global, biome, and local scales. Our analyses illustrate the ways in which temperature, water availability, physio-chemical properties, and depth jointly exert impacts on τ. The data-driven approaches allow us to identify their interactions, thereby enriching our comprehension of mechanisms driving nonlinear τ–environment relationships at global to local scales. The distributions of dominating factors of τ at local scales were mapped for purposes of identifying context-dependent controls on τ across different regions. We further reveal that the current Earth system models may underestimate τ by comparing model-derived maps with our observation-derived τ maps. The resulting maps, with new insights, as demonstrated in this study, will facilitate future modelling efforts relating to carbon cycle–climate feedbacks and support effective carbon management.

When dipoles are asymmetric in strength, the stronger dipole eddies generally drive weaker ones to move around, resulting in a reduction of discrepancies in their kinematic properties, which is referred to as the “gear-like” process. An integrated observation of an asymmetric eddy dipole was conducted in the South China Sea in April 2023, which evidences the “gear-like” process. 
 Mesoscale dipoles consist of mesoscale eddies with opposite signs. They are globally discovered and play a significant role in eddy-eddy interactions. Due to the complexities of the marine environment, many dipoles are asymmetric, characterized by unequal strengths between the dipole eddies. The strong interaction has been observed between asymmetric dipole eddies, a phenomenon referred to as the “gear-like” process. Specifically, stronger dipole eddies generally drive weaker ones to move around, resulting in a reduction of discrepancies in their kinematic properties, such as rotational speed, amplitude, and eddy kinetic energy. An integrated observation of an asymmetric eddy dipole was conducted in the South China Sea in April 2023. The general characteristics of the dipole eddies were derived from satellite altimeter data, and the evolution of their vertical structures was studied based on the joint data from Argo floats, gliders, drifters, and a survey vessel. Employing rigorous criteria, a 10−day successive coupling process of an asymmetric dipole was identified between a weaker anticyclonic eddy (AE) and a stronger cyclonic eddy (CE) from 13 to 22 April 2023. AE was initially weaker than CE in early April and strengthened when it coupled with CE, which is similar to the “gear-like” process. In addition, the drifting speed of the drifters further confirmed the “gear-like” process between the target asymmetric dipole. The vertical temperature anomalies were surprisingly positive (~0.5 °C at 50−300 m) on the CE periphery and reveal a distinct conical AE structure at 60−350 m. AE induced a significant sinking of dissolved oxygen saturation during the coupling process. Furthermore, the coupling interaction increased CE’s positive temperature anomaly near the contact zone and deepened AE’s temperature and dissolved oxygen saturation structures. Both thermohaline and biological responses provide evidence that the interaction between the asymmetric dipole eddies impacted the vertical transport of water. These findings, on the one hand, support the observations that weaker dipole eddies strengthen after coupling with stronger ones. On the other hand, the results offer valuable vertical structure information of the asymmetric eddy dipole."

Direct measurements of dissolved oxygen are sparse, and interpolation methods are needed to study the variability and changes in oxygen content. In this work, we used machine learning to improve estimates of oxygen levels across the global ocean. Our approach produces a new gridded product that captures detailed changes in oxygen over time and space. 
 Ocean deoxygenation, driven by climate change, poses significant challenges to marine ecosystems and can profoundly alter nutrient and carbon cycling. Quantifying the rate and regional patterns of deoxygenation relies on spatio-temporal interpolation tools to fill gaps in observational coverage of dissolved oxygen. However, this task is challenging due to the sparsity of observations, and classical interpolation methods often lead to high uncertainty and biases, typically underestimating long-term deoxygenation trends. In this work, we develop a novel gridded dissolved oxygen product by integrating direct oxygen observations with machine-learning-based emulated oxygen estimates derived from temperature and salinity profiles. The gridded product is then generated through optimal interpolation of both the observed and emulated data. The resulting product shows strong agreement with baseline climatology and captures well-known patterns of seasonal variability and long-term deoxygenation trends. It also outperforms current state-of-the-art products by more accurately capturing dissolved oxygen variability at synoptic and decadal scales, and by reducing uncertainty around long-term changes. This study highlights the potential of combining machine learning with classical interpolation methods to generate improved gridded biogeochemical products, enhancing our ability to study and understand ocean biogeochemical processes and their variability under a changing climate."

Previous studies reported that individual disinfectants induce the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR); however, the impacts of the coexposure to multiple disinfectants on the development of AMR and its toxicity associated with bacterial pathogenicity are still unclear. Here, we conducted a 30-day stepwise exposure experiment to investigate the impacts of the commonly used disinfectants polyhexamethylene guanidine (PHMG), benzalkonium chloride (BAC), and their combination on AMR and pathogenicity of Wild-Type Escherichia coli. Results reveal that the coexistence of dual disinfectants dramatically led to higher levels of AMR (2.0- to 14.8-fold) and pathogenicity (8.7-fold) in the evolved strains. Dual disinfectant-induced bacterial evolution is primarily driven by the alteration in the expression of key functional genes, such as those involved in biofilm formation and cell motility. In contrast, genetic mutations may not account for the increased AMR and pathogenicity in combination of dual disinfectant treatment, as similar gene mutations are responsible for both dual and single disinfectant stress. The evolved strains induced by disinfectant combination, characterized with transcriptional regulation, exhibited a synergistic or additive response on AMR and pathogenicity, which was further confirmed by a toxicology prediction model. This study demonstrated that dual disinfectants synergistically enhanced AMR and the associated pathogenicity, advancing our understanding of the risks posed by coexistence of multiple chemical pollutants in the environment."

Here, we quantify the OP of the PM originating from commonly used indoor sources via three different assays, i.e., dithiothreitol consumption (OPDTT), glutathione consumption (OPGSH), and hydroxyl radical generation (OPOH). The intrinsic (mass-normalized) OPm of several sources (candles, incense, cigarettes, humidifiers using tap water, toasters, and air fryers) were comparable (0.75–1.25×) or exceeded (1–6×) that of typical ambient PM2.5. Emissions from candles in the presence of a wind-draft had the highest OPDTTm and OPOHm while OPGSHm was highest for cigarette emissions. Elemental carbon determined the OP of PM emitted from sources undergoing incomplete combustion, whereas, for noncombustion sources (water evaporation and heating-based), metals were the important drivers. An exploratory exposure assessment in a hypothetical apartment (volume = 100 m3, air change rate = 0.45 h–1, and penetration coefficient = 0.6) revealed that certain sources (e.g., incense, cigarettes, toasters, and air-fryers) could result in occupants being exposed to higher OP in less than 1 h of indoor operation than that resulting from inhaling typical U.S. ambient PM2.5 (8 μg/m3) over an entire day.

These clusters correspond to distinct hydrologic regimes and reveal specific salinization risks: (1) phosphorus pollution mobilized during summer storms (Cluster 1); (2) elevated concentrations of sulfate and bicarbonate during baseflow (Cluster 2), likely reflecting groundwater discharge; and (3) elevated specific conductance and sodium, chloride, and potassium ion concentrations during snowmelt and rain-on-snow events (Cluster 3), driven by deicer and anti-icer wash-off.

There is increasing evidence that eco-corona plays a critical role in determining the fate, transport, and impact of nanoplastics. In this study, we show that even a low mass of eco-corona formed on nanoplastics significantly affects the cotransport of nanoplastics and organic contaminants in porous media. Specifically, eco-corona formation promotes the transport of 4-nonylphenol with polystyrene nanoplastics, especially when the eco-corona forms after contaminant adsorption to nanoplastics. Spectroscopic evidence indicates that 4-nonylphenol molecules are sequestered between the nanoplastics and the eco-corona due to the simultaneous binding to surface O-functional groups of the nanoplastics and to the polar macromolecules preferentially acquired by the nanoplastics. Transport modeling and supplementary adsorption/desorption experiments confirm that this binding configuration effectively inhibits or retards the release of 4-nonylphenol from the nanoplastics-eco-corona complex. Conversely, for 2,2′,4,4′-tetrabromodiphenyl ether, an eco-corona inhibits its cotransport with nanoplastics by blocking the porous domains of the nanoparticles, which are the preferred binding sites for nonpolar, nonionic, hydrophobic compounds. The dynamic interplays between nanoplastics, macromolecules, and contaminants have important implications for predicting the spread, release, and bioaccumulation of plastic additives in aquatic environments."

However, its potential is hindered by the lack of dual-functional cathode materials for simultaneously achieving efficient in situ H2O2 generation and activation. Particularly, developing cathode-based electron transfer channels for the green activation of H2O2 without Fe(II) regeneration presents significant challenges. Here, we designed a nonheme iron catalyst, which employs polypyrrole as an auxiliary ligand to direct the reduction of oxygen into H2O2 and superoxide radicals (O2•–). A pathway was innovatively constructed in which the O2/O2•– redox couple was employed to transfer electrons from the cathode for activating in situ generated H2O2. Although the reaction between O2•– and H2O2 is typically considered unfeasible traditionally due to the slow rate, the energy barrier was lowered to 48% and kinetically accelerated through biomimetic electrocatalysis, which led to a 370% enhancement in water purification efficiency. We confirmed that only the presence of coordination between the auxiliary ligand and the nonheme iron catalyst can obtain the formation of O2•–.

To address this gap, we conducted a process‐based evaluation to examine the atmospheric processes and physical mechanisms influencing regional climate simulations. We used downscaled data from the Conformal Cubic Atmospheric Model (CCAM) driven by European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) over Australia at 10 km spatial resolution. Using ERA5 driven downscaling is useful for model evaluation, as it avoids the inherent biases from initial and boundary conditions present in free running CMIP6 coupled global climate models.

CCAM also successfully captured key large‐scale circulation features, such as the monsoonal westerly, subtropical jet, and Australian precipitation teleconnections with climate modes of variability (e.g., El Niño‐Southern Oscillation and Indian Ocean Dipole). CCAM underestimated mean sea level pressure in northern Australia, resulting in stronger wind circulation (monsoonal westerly) over ocean north of Australia. This led to dry biases in humidity over northern Australia and contributed to dry biases over the north and northeast coasts. CCAM simulated stronger north‐south wind and moisture flux in central Australia, which may be associated with wet biases over western Queensland.

From 1990 to 2021, global age‐standardized SHDI (age ≥60 years) averagely decreased by 1.2% for both men and women. Our analysis further revealed that socio‐economic factors (e.g., socio‐demographic indices, governance) strongly impacted global SHDI changes, while climatic and environmental factors (e.g., extreme climate and air pollution) showed significant differences across genders. Our study highlights the need for implementing comprehensive healthcare strategies, focusing on reducing health disparities and addressing environmental and socio‐economic determinants to address inequalities in age‐related diseases effectively."

 Long (>200 nucleotides) non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in diverse aspects of life. Over 20 classes of lncRNAs have been identified in bacteria and bacteriophages through comparative genomics analyses, but their biological functions remain largely unexplored1-3. Due to the large sizes, the structural determinants of most lncRNAs also remain uncharacterized. Here we report the structures of two natural RNA nanocages formed by the lncRNA ROOL (rumen-originating, ornate, large) found in bacterial and phage genomes. ~2.9 Å cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures reveal that ROOL RNAs form an octameric nanocage with a 28-nm diameter and 20-nm axial length, whose hollow inside features poorly ordered regions. The octamer is stabilized by numerous tertiary and quaternary interactions, including triple-strand A-minors that we propose to name “A-minor staples”. The structure of an isolated ROOL monomer at ~3.2-Å resolution indicates that nanocage assembly involves a strand-swapping mechanism resulting in quaternary kissing loops. Finally, we show that ROOL RNA fused to an RNA aptamer, tRNA, or microRNA retains its structure forming a nanocage with radially displayed cargos. Our findings therefore may enable the engineering of novel RNA nanocages as delivery vehicles for research and therapeutic applications."

 Large-scale quasi-stationary Rossby waves in the tropospheric jet stream favour spatially compounding hot–dry and cold–wet weather across the northern hemisphere. However, how this circumglobal circulation pattern affects northern hemisphere ecosystem productivity remains unexplored. Here, using satellite proxies of vegetation photosynthesis, we assess the impact of Rossby wave-7 events during which the jet stream exhibits seven peaks and troughs and tends to produce prolonged weather anomalies. Our results show organized declines in vegetation productivity in warm cores and enhancement in cold cores at northern mid-latitudes during summer Rossby wave-7 events. Mid-latitude biomes within warm cores become much more susceptible to water limitations, resulting from an increased exposure to compound hot–dry (or cold–wet) extremes and a nonlinear physiological response to compound stressors. Of the warm cores analysed, wave events elevate the climatic risk of productivity declines by a factor of 8.3, 6.2 and 4.0 over western Europe, western Asia and the western United States, respectively, due to hot–dry extremes. In particular, 32–44% of the warm anomalies and 52–88% of the dry anomalies fall within the range of warmer–drier conditions projected for 2081–2100 by state-of-the-art climate models under a medium emissions scenario. Therefore, the observed Rossby-wave-driven impacts provide an indication of how a warmer–drier future climate could reduce the carbon uptake capacity of northern hemisphere ecosystems. Satellite observations suggest that prolonged hot–dry conditions induced by Rossby waves in the jet stream reduce ecosystem productivity, providing insights into the potential impacts of a future warmer and probably drier climate."

 Spatial multi-slice multi-omics (SMSMO) integration has transformed our understanding of cellular niches, particularly in tumors. However, challenges like data scale and diversity, disease heterogeneity, and limited sample population size, impede the derivation of clinical insights. Here, we propose stClinic, a dynamic graph model that integrates SMSMO and phenotype data to uncover clinically relevant niches. stClinic aggregates information from evolving neighboring nodes with similar-profiles across slices, aided by a Mixture-of-Gaussians prior on latent features. Furthermore, stClinic directly links niches to clinical manifestations by characterizing each slice with attention-based geometric statistical measures, relative to the population. In cancer studies, stClinic uses survival time to assess niche malignancy, identifying aggressive niches enriched with tumor-associated macrophages, alongside favorable prognostic niches abundant in B and plasma cells. Additionally, stClinic identifies a niche abundant in SPP1+ MTRNR2L12+ myeloid cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts driving colorectal cancer cell adaptation and invasion in healthy liver tissue. These findings are supported by independent functional and clinical data. Notably, stClinic excels in label annotation through zero-shot learning and facilitates multi-omics integration by relying on other tools for latent feature initialization.

 A major challenge hampering therapeutic advancements for high-risk sarcoma patients is the broad spectrum of molecularly distinct sarcoma types and the corresponding lack of suitable model systems. Here we describe the development of a genetically-controlled, yet versatile mouse modeling platform allowing delivery of different genetic lesions by muscle electroporation (EPO) in wildtype mice. This EPO-GEMM (EPO-based genetically engineered mouse model) platform allows the generation of ten genetically distinct sarcomas on an isogenic background, including the first model of ETV6::NTRK3-driven sarcoma. Comprehensive histological and molecular profiling reveals that this mouse sarcoma cohort recapitulates a spectrum of molecularly diverse sarcomas with gene fusions acting as major determinants of sarcoma biology. Integrative cross-species analyses show faithful recapitulation of human sarcoma subtypes, including expression of relevant immunotherapy targets. Comparison of syngeneic allografting methods enables reliable preservation and scalability of sarcoma-EPO-GEMMs for preclinical treatment trials, such as NTRK inhibitor therapy in an immunocompetent background.

 Zygotic genome activation (ZGA) is a critical developmental milestone characterized by the rapid and simultaneous activation of genome-widely silenced chromatin. Various active histone modifications accumulate upon ZGA and have long been implicated in ZGA. However, their biological relevance still remains unclear. Here, we comprehensively examined the functional significance of active histone modifications and their writers during ZGA in teleost embryos. Our data propose that developmental genes and housekeeping genes are distinctively regulated during ZGA; CBP/P300 activity is required for developmental gene activation, whereas housekeeping genes depend on non-CBP/P300 histone acetylations H3K9ac/H4K16ac/H3K14ac. Moreover, accumulation of H3K4me2/3 is not prerequisite for activation of all types of genes during ZGA, in contrast to previous reports with cell lines. Finally, temporal accumulation of H3.3S31ph greatly enhances CBP/P300 activity specifically at ZGA, ensuring the activation of developmental genes. Our data demonstrate that multiple histone modifications cooperatively shape ZGA-specific gene activation programs in non-mammalian vertebrates.

 Current national emissions targets fall short of the Paris Agreement goals, prompting the need for equitable ways to close this gap. Fair emissions allowances rely on effort-sharing formulas based on fairness principles, yielding diverse outcomes. These variations, shaped by normative decisions, complicate policymaking and legal assessments of climate targets. Here we provide up-to-date numbers, comprehensively accounting for three dimensions—physical and social uncertainties, global strategies and equity—and the relative impact of them on each country’s emissions allowance. In the short run, normative considerations substantially impact fair emissions allowances—directing current discussions to this debate—while global discussions on temperature targets and non-CO2 emissions take over in the long run. We identify many countries with insufficient nationally determined contributions in light of fairness and discuss implications for increased domestic mitigation and financing emissions reductions abroad—yielding a total international finance flux of $US0.5–7.4 trillion in 2030.

 In numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, horizontal and vertical turbulent mixing is parameterized separately within the dynamic solver of a model and by a one-dimensional standalone module outside the dynamic core. This method becomes problematic as model resolution increases to the gray zone of turbulence parameterization where three-dimensional (3D) anisotropic turbulence tends to generate inter-connected horizontal and vertical mixing that cannot be artificially separated. To remediate the problem, a 3D scale-aware (SA) turbulence scheme based on a generalized turbulence closure applicable across scales has been developed and implemented in the Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System (HAFS). Simulations of 11 Atlantic basin storms of 2024 show that the new scheme substantially improves HAFS’s forecasting skill for storms with hurricane strength, suggesting that an appropriate account for 3D anisotropic turbulent transport is important for track and intensity forecast of tropical cyclones and provides a venue for realistically representing sub-grid-scale turbulence in NWP."

 We investigate the drivers of projected summer precipitation changes and their uncertainties across Africa in the second half of the 21st century under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios using CMIP6 models. Our results reveal distinct regional precipitation changes, particularly under SSP5-8.5, with robust increases of 75%, 24%, and 17% over the Sahara, South Eastern Africa, and South Central Africa, respectively, and a decline of up to 5% over West Southern Africa (WSAF). In most regions, precipitation increases are driven by enhanced vertical thermodynamic processes associated with temperature-induced moisture increases and enhanced moisture convergence. In contrast, the WSAF decrease is associated with vertical dynamic processes driven by a weakening of the Hadley circulation’s ascending branch. Model uncertainty accounts for over 85% of total projection uncertainty across all regions and is largely due to subgrid-scale parameterizations.

 The spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation significantly impacts human lives. While reanalysis datasets provide consistent long-term global precipitation information that allows investigations of rainfall-driven hazards like larger-scale flooding, they lack the resolution to capture the high spatio-temporal variability of precipitation and miss intense local rainfall events. Here, we introduce spateGAN-ERA5, the first deep learning-based spatio-temporal downscaling of precipitation data on a global scale. SpateGAN-ERA5 enhances ERA5 precipitation data from 24 km and 1 h to 2 km and 10 min, delivering high-resolution rainfall fields with realistic spatio-temporal patterns and accurate rain rate distribution, including extremes. Its computational efficiency enables the generation of a large ensemble of solutions, addressing uncertainties inherent to downscaling challenges and supports practical applicability for generating high-resolution precipitation data for arbitrary ERA5 time periods and regions on demand. Trained solely on data from Germany and validated in the US and Australia, considering diverse climates, including tropical rainfall regimes, spateGAN-ERA5 demonstrates strong generalization, indicating robust global applicability. It fulfills critical needs for high-resolution precipitation data in hydrological and meteorological research."

 The impact of climate change on tropical cyclones (TCs) remains a critical concern, but understanding is limited by short instrumental records and low-resolution prehistoric data. Here, we present the first daily-resolution proxy data for investigating prehistoric TC activity, using a 12-year growth rate record of a fossil Tridacna shell (circa 3 ka BP) from the northern South China Sea (NSCS). By analyzing temporal patterns in the proxy data, we derived monthly TC frequency estimates. While modern TC frequency in the NSCS peaks in autumn (September–October), our results showed that TCs at 3 ka BP occurred more frequently in summer (June–July–August), with approximately 15% higher frequency than present. Combined with paleoclimate records, we suggested that this seasonal shift and increased frequency were likely linked to the relatively northward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, which provided favourable conditions for TC formation and development. Our findings imply that future warming would contribute to earlier TC seasons and increased TC frequency in the NSCS."

 Water availability limits evapotranspiration on land, shaping the energy balance, land carbon uptake, and climate extremes. Despite its importance, Earth system models struggle to capture where and how often water-limited conditions occur. Here we investigate the representation of water limitation and its link to land water storage capacity in simulations from the Sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) driven by consistent observational atmospheric forcing. Using observations of remotely sensed solar-induced vegetation fluorescence and terrestrial water storage, together with ecosystem flux data, we find that CMIP6 models overestimate the frequency of water limitation by 14% over land and 26% in the tropics. Model overestimation occurs over 57% of the land area, and 78% in the tropics. These too frequent water-limited conditions are not conclusively linked to a potential underestimation of land water storage capacity in the models, hinting at gaps in how ESMs represent rooting depths, plant water uptake, and plant water-use strategies. Our study highlights the need for model development in these areas, with implications for projections of future climate on land.

 Glacial lakes in high-altitude regions influence both water systems and greenhouse gas emissions, yet the effects of different hydrological recharge mechanisms on methane release and microbial ecosystems remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated methane fluxes and microbial community patterns in glacier-fed and non-glacier-fed lakes on the Tibetan Plateau during peak ablation stage. Our findings revealed that total methane flux from non-glacier-fed lakes were approximately three times higher than from glacier-fed lakes, with ebullition being the predominant emission pathway. Network analysis showed that the microbial community structure in glacier-fed lakes was more stable. The neutral community model confirmed deterministic processes mainly shape microbial assembly in glacial lakes with different recharge types. Microbial communities in glacier-fed lakes were more stable and tightly connected, while those in non-glacier-fed lakes were more fragmented. As glacier melting accelerates with climate change, more lakes may lose glacier input, potentially increasing methane emissions and disrupting microbial ecosystems.

 Minerals are pivotal environmental factors influencing the adaptation and evolution of microbial communities. Conventional wisdom has long regarded the impact of minerals as a byproduct of their role in providing nutrients and energy to organisms, largely overlooking the significance of non-nutritive and energy-neutral mineral species. In this study, we explore the influence of minerals on microbial development in nutrient- and energy-rich media through a serial passage evolution experiment. Our results show both the inert mineral kaolinite and the energy/nutrient-rich olivine exert evident effects on the microorganisms. Both minerals induced substantial shifts in community structure. Notably, kaolinite and olivine selectively enriched specific taxa, including Acinetobacter and Clostridium. Metatranscriptomic analyses revealed substantial changes in gene expression, with both minerals enriching unique metabolic pathways. Interestingly, kaolinite specifically enriched pathways related to streptomycin biosynthesis. Both minerals stimulated the expression of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), particularly those associated with multidrug and macrolide resistance. Furthermore, both minerals induced the upregulation of genes involved in the degradation of complex organic matter, highlighting their potential role in soil carbon cycling. These findings underscore the intricate interplay between minerals and microbes, challenging the conventional notion that minerals function solely as material sources for organism growth.

 Deep-sea mud is rich in rare-earth elements, primarily found in fluorapatite, a mineral deposit that forms over hundreds of thousands to millions of years through the accumulation of fish remains. After fish die, biogenic apatite captures rare earth elements from seawater on the seafloor and from pore waters during the diagenesis process. The conventional model for rare earth element enrichment suggests that they are incorporated into the bioapatite crystal structure through solid-state diffusion. However, our data reveal that cerium atoms are instead precipitated within an amorphous layer surrounding bioapatite nanocrystals, as shown by high-energy-resolution X-ray absorption spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Computational simulations further support this finding, predicting that cerium atoms cluster on the surface of fluorapatite. These results suggest that the fluorapatite-water interface plays a crucial role in the enrichment of cerium, as well as other rare earth elements, in marine sediments.

 International export is a key driver of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution in China, but the specific pollution contribution among foreign consumers to Chinese regions is still unclear. Here, we integrate atmospheric and economic models to explore this contribution. International export accounts for 9.9% of China’s ambient PM2.5 pollution in 2017, ranging from 7.2% in the Southwest to 13.8% in the East Coast. Material & energy production and transportation are the key producing contributors. The USA and Western Europe are the leading pollution contributors to most provinces. Foreign consumption on construction and manufacturing products contributes most pollution. Over 75.0% of the pollution is embodied in indirect exports and the proportion decreases as the supply chain deepens. Although inland regions only account for 19.8% of China’s export volume, their associated pollution contributions reach 65.0%.

 The Yucatan Peninsula is one of the largest coastal and lowland karst regions worldwide. This groundwater-dependent region is highly vulnerable to contaminants that spread easily due to the karst environment. Here, the spatio-temporal patterns of major ions in 1528 water samples sourced from a government institution suggest the main factors triggering salinization in the aquifer system. The hydrogeochemical analysis, supported by dimensional reduction and network-based clustering, linked one-third of the samples to contamination outbreaks from seawater intrusion, extensive gypsum dissolution in the south, and nitrate pollution in the ubiquitous carbonate aquifer matrix. Temporal variations of water quality indicated changes in regional recharge trends and increasing human impact in recent decades. Moreover, ~23% of water samples from human-use sources exceeded acceptable sulfate and nitrate limits for drinking water purposes. The study underscores the need for continuous water quality monitoring and enhanced regional knowledge to support management plans.

 The East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) shape China's summer climate. The transition from July to August marks a critical shift between the Meiyu season and the North/Northeast China rainy season, yet the underlying drivers of the inter-monthly evolution in precipitation during this period remains unclear. This study investigates the relationship between sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) in the northern Indian Ocean (NIO)-South China Sea (NIO-SCS) and the inter-monthly precipitation evolution in eastern China during July–August. A significant interdecadal shift in the relationship between the NIO-SCS SSTAs and eastern China's precipitation around 1995/96. Before 1995, warm NIO-SCS SSTAs consistently enhanced precipitation in the Huaihe-Yangtze River Basin (HYRB) throughout July and August, primarily altered by the Pacific-Japan (PJ) teleconnection pattern. However, after 1996, a distinct pattern emerged: warm NIO-SCS SSTAs increased precipitation over the HYRB and simultaneously reduced precipitation in North/Northeast China in July. In contrast, this pattern is reversed in August. Based on observations and numerical experiments, the interdecadal shift is linked to a weakening of Indian Ocean SSTAs after 1996 compared to before. During the post-1996, cooler Indian Ocean SSTAs in July weaken the Kelvin wave, shifting the PJ pattern westward and broadly influencing precipitation across eastern China. In August, the cooler Indian Ocean SSTAs induce westward-shifted Walker circulation anomalies, with a descending branch near the Philippine Sea extending to 30°N, leading to decreased precipitation in the HYRB and increased precipitation over North/Northeast China. Furthermore, the reduction in NIO-SCS SSTAs' amplitude after 1996 may be attributed to a weakened spring ENSO amplitude, potentially linked to the positive phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation."

 Spaceborne dual-frequency precipitation radar provides valuable insights into precipitation microphysics on a larger scale than ground-based sensors. In this study, the spatial distribution pattern of warm-season heavy precipitation microphysics in China is investigated using observations from China's first precipitation satellite, FY-3G PMR, from April to September 2024. Firstly, the quality of this new satellite dataset is evaluated by comparing it to ground-based polarimetric radar observations and retrievals. Subsequently, the spatial evolution of heavy precipitation microphysics is demonstrated in terms of the monsoon's advancement and the three-step topography across China, in association with the variation in raindrop size distribution (DSD) and the responsible microphysical processes. As the raindrop diameter increases and the number concentration decreases with increasing latitude, the maritime-DSD feature of the South China Sea, the monsoonal-DSD of South and Central-East China, and the continental-DSD of North China, are identified. Typically, the monsoonal-DSD, which is shaped by a predominant accretion process in the warm layer, is newly defined based on large-scale satellite observations.
