10.1021/acs.est.4c13066,False,Environmental Science & Technology,这篇论文主要关注渔业对海洋生态系统生物多样性的影响，并提出了在生命周期评估（Life Cycle Assessment）中量化这些影响的新方法。它结合了动态生态系统建模和物种敏感性分布曲线，来评估渔业活动通过捕食者-猎物关系对海洋生物群落的影响。论文重点在于开发一种新的评估框架，用于评估渔业对生物多样性的潜在影响，并使用亚得里亚海的案例来验证该方法的可行性。该研究与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系。,[],Chloe Stanford-Clark;Cécile Bulle;Eléonore Loiseau;Arnaud Helias,Ecosystem-Scale Biodiversity in Fisheries Life Cycle Impact Assessment,"The impact of fisheries was recently operationalised in Life Cycle Assessment, accounting for effects on individual exploited species at both regional and global scales. Now, this emergent pathway is expanded to the ecosystem scale by incorporating additional indirect impacts associated with fishing through the integration of ecosystem dynamics. The methodology combines a novel coupling of dynamic ecosystem modeling and species sensitivity distribution curves to quantify fisheries effects on marine biodiversity, using an adaptation of the USEtox effect factor modeling that assesses community-scale ecotoxicity impacts. Innovative elements include the incorporation of indirect effects through a fished community via predator–prey interactions, and a bidirectional threshold interval that captures both potential population depletion and expansion dynamics resulting from exploitation. A proof of concept is presented in the Adriatic Sea, deriving novel midpoint characterization factors for 26 exploited functional groups, with impacts reported in potentially affected fraction (PAF) units. Impact values are spread over 6 orders of magnitude (1.58× 10–7 PAF small/medium rays −2.16 × 10–1 PAF small pelagic fish), validating the operability of the approach. Methodological choices and assumptions introduced by the novel approach are discussed. The original combination of modeling tools employed in this characterization approach contributes to the progressive enhancement of the fisheries impact pathway and how biodiversity loss is considered in life cycle impact assessment."

Given that most of the extreme precipitation in the extratropics is associated with cyclones, fronts, and moisture transport axes, we analyze the changes in precipitation characteristics associated with these weather features, as well as their combinations, in a climate model (CESM2‐LE) for the period 1950–2100. We find that extreme precipitation associated with fronts increases substantially in the extratropics. Extreme precipitation associated with non‐frontal conditions, on the other hand, does not increase and even decreases in some regions. Hence, atmospheric fronts are the main driver of future extreme precipitation changes in the extratropics."

J. Tuckman,Understanding ENSO Weakening in Warmer Climates,"El Niño and La Niña events control much of Earth's interannual variability, impacting surface temperatures and precipitation worldwide. Despite their importance, how these events will change as the climate warms is not fully understood. Here, we use idealized atmosphere‐ocean simulations to study the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) under equilibrated greenhouse warming. In warmer climates, the atmosphere transports energy more efficiently, smoothing the Pacific zonal temperature gradient and weakening the Walker Circulation. Since these zonal asymmetries are the source of ENSO instability, ENSO growth rates decrease in warmer climates, leading to less extreme ENSO events. Additionally, the weakening of ENSO leads to less ENSO asymmetry so the strengths of El Niño and La Niña events become more similar in warmer climates. We interpret these results with an energy budget of the Central‐Eastern Equatorial Pacific."

Traditionally attributed to prolonged photoionization and ionospheric uplift during summer, the WSA is not reproduced by the latest Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model. We introduce a data‐driven flux approach to incorporate more realistic diffusive flux, significantly improving the model's ability to replicate key WSA features. Simulations show that topside plasma diffusion turns downward in the evening, peaking near midnight, contributing notably to the NmF2 enhancement. Around 22:00 local time, downward plasmaspheric diffusion becomes the dominant plasma source, rivaling or exceeding local photoionization (12.08 vs. 8.50 cm−3s−1 ${\text{cm}}^{-3}{\mathrm{s}}^{-1}$ at 22:30).

However, observational noise often obscures waves, complicating such comparisons. To address this, we have developed a GW detection method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN is trained on Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) temperatures with labels indicating wave presence based on Berthelemy et al. (2025, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere‐2025‐455). Their method detects noise‐induced pixel‐to‐pixel variations in horizontal wavelengths; in contrast, the CNN robustly identify waves even when applied to smoothly varying model data. Using this method, we compare stratospheric GWs in boreal winters between AIRS observations and a high‐top GW‐permitting GCM, Japanese Atmospheric GCM for Upper Atmosphere Research (JAGUAR). The results agree well and exhibit similar interannual variability, with discrepancies also identified, including a more zonally elongated distribution of tropical GWs in JAGUAR.

Accurate estimation of ERR can help identify regions with a strong dependence on the terrestrial water cycle, offering valuable implications for land use management. However, the existing techniques for calculating ERR at continental or global scales depend on the accuracy of simulations on complicated and underlying processes, which are difficult to conduct. To address this methodological gap, we propose a novel method that integrates precipitation, surface evaporation, and water vapor flux divergence, incorporating the microphysics scheme of clouds and precipitation. This method utilizes remote sensing data, including precipitation, evaporation, specific humidity, wind speed, water vapor, water content, and other variables, without relying on complicated simulation results. It features a simple structure and low computational cost. Using this approach, we map historical ERR from 1985 to 2014 to establish a baseline for spatial distributions and driving factors. To further validate the results from this study, we calculate the response of ERR to climate change under SSP5‐8.5 and SSP1‐2.6 scenarios for the near term (2024–2040) and long term (2081–2099), and then compare our results with other existing climate change studies. The comparisons demonstrate the robustness of our method. We conclude that the proposed method can offer an effective approach for quantifying ERR at continental or global scales."
10.1029/2024JD042597,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文提出了一种基于NICAM的亚网格降水生成方法，用于模拟通用环流模式（GCMs）中的云雷达信号。该方法旨在解决GCMs在模拟云和降水细节方面的不足，这些细节通常以亚网格过程表示，依赖于参数化和空间覆盖的假设。通过使用全球风暴解析模型NICAM获取亚网格变率，该方法首先基于概率情景生成亚网格降水掩模，然后根据给定的云量和网格尺度降水率，从广义伽马分布中生成亚网格降水率。该方法能够较好地重现NICAM数据集的降水比例和基于雷达的云量剖面。虽然在热带地区精度稍逊，但云内信号频率也得到了较好的重现。将该方法应用于GCM表明，其在低层液态云方面存在稳健的偏差。此外，降水的亚网格变率导致了更多小信号的出现，尤其是在高降水率范围内。该方法旨在生成地理相关的降水亚网格变率，为使用全球风暴解析模型评估传统GCM提供了一种有效途径。虽然该研究没有直接涉及空气质量监测或大气成分分析，但通过改进GCM中云和降水的模拟，可以间接提高卫星观测数据在这些领域的应用。,"['radar reflectivity', 'cloud fraction', 'precipitation', 'general circulation models (GCMs)', 'global storm-resolving model (NICAM)', 'sub-grid precipitation', 'cloud radar signals', 'satellite observations (indirectly through GCM evaluation)']",Tempei Hashino;Masaki Satoh;Takuji Kubota;Tsuyoshi Koshiro;Kozo Okamoto;Yuichiro Hagihara;Hajime Okamoto;Tatsuya Seiki,A Sub‐Grid Precipitation Generator Based on NICAM for Simulating Cloud Radar Signals With GCMs,"The forward simulation of radar reflectivity requires details of clouds and precipitation from general circulation models (GCMs). But such details are represented as sub‐grid processes that involve parameterizations and assumptions about the spatial coverage and thus depend on the GCM. In this research, we propose the use of a statistical method to generate sub‐grid precipitation for generic use. The sub‐grid variability is obtained from simulation with a global storm‐resolving model called NICAM (non‐hydrostatic icosahedral atmospheric model). The proposed method first generates sub‐grid precipitation masks based on probabilistic scenarios and then sub‐grid precipitation rates are generated from the generalized gamma distribution for the given cloud fraction and grid‐scale precipitation rates. Compared to the standard method (which neglects the probabilities) that overestimates the precipitation fraction, our method well reproduces the NICAM data set profiles of both the precipitation fraction and the radar‐based cloud fraction. The in‐cloud signal frequencies are also reproduced, although less accurately over a tropical region. Inclusion of sub‐grid variability in precipitation rates was particularly important for the tropical region to obtain agreement of the precipitation fraction. Application of the two methods to a GCM shows it to have a robust bias for low‐level liquid clouds. Furthermore, the sub‐grid variability of precipitation led to more occurrences of the small signals, particularly for a range of high precipitation rates. The proposed method was designed to produce geographically dependent sub‐grid variability in precipitation, indicating an effective way to use a global storm‐resolving model to evaluate conventional GCMs."

However, the drivers, impacts, and characteristics of the rapid transition in India have not been examined. Here, we use a well‐calibrated hydrological model to simulate root‐zone SM to identify rapid SM transitions in India for the 1951–2024 period. We show that rapid transition predominantly occurs during the monsoon season (June to September) in India with an average duration of two pentads. Soil moisture rapid transitions show a nonsignificant decreasing trend in transition duration and an increasing trend in intensity during 1951–2024. Most (more than 66%) of the large‐scale rapid transitions are from drought to wet phase. Only two out of six homogeneous precipitation regions in India experienced equal numbers of drought‐to‐wet phase and wet phase‐to‐drought transitions, while the other four had more drought‐to‐wet phase transitions. Long dry spells/monsoon breaks during the monsoon season and positive air temperature anomalies rapidly deplete SM resulting in droughts. On the other hand, the sudden influx of moisture into the drought‐affected region caused wet phases. The major country‐level rapid transitions from wet phase to drought occurred during the monsoon seasons of 1972, 2009, and 2023; whereas transitions from drought to wet phase occurred in 2005, 1972, 1970, and 1962. Notably, 1972 experienced both types of rapid transitions, highlighting intraseasonal variability during the monsoon season."

However, existing studies on WPSH seasonal prediction have primarily focused on the recent 20–30 years, limiting our ability to assess decadal variations in prediction skill. Here, based on CSF‐20C seasonal hindcast (1901–2010), we find the prediction skill of WPSH improved post‐1960s due to increased signal‐to‐noise ratio in model, which is driven by strengthened predictable signals rather than noise reduction. Through comparative analysis of high‐skill (1961–2010) and low‐skill (1901–1950) periods, we identify three persistent oceanic predictors of WPSH variability: sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in tropical central‐eastern Pacific, tropical North Atlantic, and Indo‐Pacific. Notably, the Indo‐Pacific region's relative contribution to prediction skill increased substantially from 40% to 59%, establishing it as the dominant driver of enhanced predictability. The expansion of observational data and intensification of quasi‐biennial ENSO variability since the 1960s may be two primary factors contributing to the enhanced predictable components of WPSH. Beyond predictable signals, we also examine the unpredictable noises in both observations and CSF‐20C. For observations, unpredictable component of SST across three key oceanic regions constitutes the primary source of WPSH‐related unpredictable noises during low‐skill period. In contrast, during high‐skill period, the main contributors to unpredictable noises shift to the SST‐independent atmospheric teleconnections in mid‐high latitudes (e.g., the East‐Atlantic pattern and summer North Atlantic Oscillation), which influence WPSH by modulating the East Asian westerly jet. Our findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms governing seasonal prediction of WPSH."

This stable stratification results in a positive lapse rate feedback, which is a major contributor to Arctic amplification. A second state, with cloudy conditions, weaker stability, and near‐zero net surface longwave flux is also observed. Previous work has shown that many CMIP5 models fail to appropriately partition water between liquid and ice phases in mixed‐phase clouds, leading to a lack of this cloudy state. In this study, we assess the representation of the Arctic winter atmospheric boundary layer over sea ice in global climate models contributing to the latest phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). We compare boundary layer process relationships in these models to those in surface‐based and radiosonde observations collected during the MOSAiC (2019–2020) and SHEBA (1997–1998) expeditions, and by North Pole drifting stations (1955–1991). The majority of CMIP6 models fail to realistically represent the cloudy state over winter Arctic sea ice. Despite this, CMIP6 multimodel mean LLS falls within the observational range, and models mostly capture the observed dependence of LLS on near‐surface air temperature and wind speed. CMIP6 models predict a decline in winter LLS with Arctic warming, with mean stability falling below zero by 2100 under the SSP2‐4.5 scenario.

However, challenges persist in evaluating hydrometeor classification (HMC) algorithms, thereby impacting the accuracy of precipitation estimates. This study proposes to use full Doppler spectra in both polarizations from a Ka‐ and W‐band Doppler‐polarimetric profiler with a 45° elevation angle to provide insights into hydrometeor characteristics. A novel methodology was developed to link the observed spectra with the output of an HMC scheme. We applied the wradlib HMC scheme using C‐band weather radar data from the Netherlands for six cases (2021–2022). The HMC scheme output is used to calculate mixing ratios that are combined with the corresponding scattering properties using the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator microwave single scattering properties database (frozen hydrometeors) and T‐matrix calculations (liquid hydrometeors) to simulate Doppler spectra of polarimetric variables that would be measured by the profiler. Comparing these simulations with actual profiler measurements enables a quality assessment. The method works in stratiform cases, but convective cases reveal the influence of turbulence and wind variability. Uncertainty arises from the selection of specific parameterizations for the particle size distribution and the relationship between hydrometeor size and terminal fall velocity as well as from the derived mixing ratios. Additionally, the 45° angle complicates separating horizontal wind from hydrometeor fall velocities, although the Mie notch in the dual‐wavelength ratio can be effectively used to remove the radial wind component. Our results underline limitations that must be addressed but also show that integrating spectral and dual‐frequency observations could yield valuable insights into hydrometeor characteristics."

This study, based on observational data from summer campaigns (July and August) in 2021 and 2022 in Chengdu, a megacity in the Sichuan Basin, investigated O3 formation sensitivity to meteorological parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, and solar radiation (represented by the photolysis coefficient of NO2). In August 2022, the urban area of Chengdu experienced its hottest month in nearly 20 years, with maximum temperatures reaching 41.6°C. By calculating the photochemical initial concentrations (PICs) of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to assess O3 reactivity, we found that summer O3 formation in Chengdu operated under a transitional regime, colimited by both VOCs and NOx. An observation‐based box model, using PIC data, further demonstrated that during the heat waves of 2022, O3 peak values increased by 31.4% compared to 2021. Additionally, when solar radiation increased by 10% from average to maximum values, O3 peak levels rose by approximately 9%, highlighting the significant effect observed. Heat waves could increase the emission and reactivity of certain VOCs, particularly from solvent use and vehicular exhaust, such as m/p‐xylene, trans‐2‐butene, and trans‐2‐pentene. These findings enhance our understanding of how extreme weather influences O3 pollution and provide valuable insights for future control strategies."
10.1029/2024EF005555,True,Earth's Future,该研究论文探讨了人为气溶胶排放和灌溉变化对南亚地区气候的影响，重点关注了两者之间的非线性相互作用。研究发现，气溶胶和灌溉的共同作用会增强气溶胶水合作用和云量，从而显著减少到达地面的短波辐射。这进一步影响了地表能量平衡。此外，研究还发现，这两种因素共同作用时，可能会导致季风风力的增强，这与单独考虑这些因素时的结果不同。这项研究表明，当前的气候变化检测和归因方法可能无法充分考虑不同气候强迫因子之间的相互作用，因此与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是关于气溶胶、云和辐射的观测和分析。,"['anthropogenic aerosols', 'aerosol hydration', 'cloud cover', 'downwelling shortwave radiation', 'surface energy balance', 'monsoon winds', 'atmospheric stability', 'climate forcing']",Veronika J. Redensek;Sonali McDermid;Deepti Singh;Geeta Persad,Nonlinear Response of the Surface Energy Balance to Changes in Anthropogenic Aerosols and Irrigation Over South Asia,"The regional climate impacts of anthropogenic aerosol emissions and irrigation growth in South Asia have conventionally been studied separately. These forcings have overlapping influences on surface temperature and atmospheric stability, but detection and attribution simulations typically quantify the impact of individual time‐evolving climate forcings, which does not account for nonlinear interactions between forcings or their impacts, when forcings evolve in tandem. Using transient simulations in GISS ModelE 2.1‐G, we assess the summertime surface energy balance in five different sub‐regions of South Asia by comparing the linear addition of anthropogenic aerosol and land use single‐forcing historical simulations with novel dual‐forcing simulations. We find that the combination of aerosol emissions and irrigation changes between preindustrial and present‐day increases aerosol hydration and cloud cover more strongly than does the linear addition of the individual forcings. This results in a strong nonlinear decrease in downwelling shortwave radiation, which drives subsequent nonlinearities in the surface energy balance through a relative suppression of energy availability at the surface. While aerosols and irrigation are each credited with suppressing monsoon winds and delaying onset, combined simulations of both forcings suggest that surface pressure is nonlinearly reduced over the northern Indian Subcontinent. This results in a net increase in 850 mb winds from the Bay of Bengal toward northwest India and Pakistan in combined simulations, suppressing the weakening of summer monsoon winds from single forcing results. The nonlinearities identified in our study suggest that the current framework for detection and attribution may not adequately account for potential interactions between forcings."

Heit;Ruike Renee Zhao,Milli-spinner thrombectomy,"The milli-spinner thrombectomy facilitates fast, complete clot removal by using spinning-induced compression and shear forces to mechanically modify the clot microstructure through densifying the fibrin network and releasing red blood cells, thus reducing clot volume. 
 Clot-induced blockage in arteries or veins can cause severe medical conditions1. Mechanical thrombectomy is a minimally invasive technique used to treat ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism and peripheral vascular disease2–4 by removing clots through aspiration5, stent retriever6 or cutting mechanisms7. However, current mechanical thrombectomy methods fail to remove clots in 10–30% of patients8–10, especially in the case of large, fibrin-rich clots11. These methods can also rupture and fragment clots12, causing distal emboli and poor outcomes13. To overcome these challenges, we develop the milli-spinner thrombectomy, which uses a simple yet innovative mechanics concept to modify the clot’s microstructure, facilitating its removal. The milli-spinner works by mechanically densifying the clot’s fibrin network and releasing red blood cells through spinning-induced compression and shear forces. It can shrink the clot volume by 95% for easy and fast removal. In vitro tests in pulmonary and cerebral artery flow models and in vivo experiments in swine models demonstrate that the milli-spinner achieves ultrafast clot debulking and high-fidelity revascularization, outperforming aspiration thrombectomy. The milli-spinner thrombectomy directly modifies the clot microstructure to facilitate clot removal, improving mechanical thrombectomy success rates compared with current methods that rely on clot rupture or cutting. This approach offers a promising new direction for mechanical thrombectomy devices, especially for treating ischaemic stroke, pulmonary embolism and peripheral thrombosis. The milli-spinner thrombectomy facilitates fast, complete clot removal by using spinning-induced compression and shear forces to mechanically modify the clot microstructure through densifying the fibrin network and releasing red blood cells, thus reducing clot volume."

 Plenty of leaf optical spectra datasets have been employed in the calibration and validation of leaf optical or empirical models. However, no experiment has been conducted that measures the true leaf reflectance and transmittance spectra while isolating chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) contributions, which results in a superimposed effect on measured reflectance or transmittance. As a result, to date, the simulated accuracy of leaf spectra in the red-edge domain remains limited due to the absence of true leaf spectra used in calibration of leaf models. This study aims to enhance the accuracy of simulating leaf spectral characteristics in the red-edge domain by combining an existing leaf physical model (PROSPECT-D) with the data-driven method that is typically used to establish leaf empirical models. A new leaf spectra dataset without ChlF contributions, including reflectance and transmittance data for 849 leaves, was first measured and replace the existing leaf spectra datasets in the modelling process. A coupled leaf optical properties model (PROSPECT-DP) was then established, in which a principal component analysis (PCA) approach was employed to model leaf spectra in red-edge domain using the spectral vectors derived from the training dataset, while the coefficients of spectral vectors were determined by leveraging the PROSPECT-D simulated leaf spectra except for the red-edge domain. Finally, validation of the PROSPECT-DP model with an independent validation dataset of 203 leaf samples showed that it performed much better than the PROSPECT-D model for spectral simulation in the red-edge domain. Furthermore, the PROSPECT-DP model exhibited better performance in leaf trait inversions with a closer relationship between measured and PROSPECT-DP-derived leaf chlorophyll a + b and carotenoid pigments compared to the PROSPECT-D model. Therefore, the novel coupled leaf model presented in this study will be highly beneficial for the integration of leaf models into canopy models and for applications in remote sensing to assess plant traits."
