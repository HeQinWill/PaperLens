Spider webs, due to their distinctive chemical composition and adsorption properties, have emerged as promising tools for monitoring environmental pollutant. This study quantified 58 HOCs in insects, spider tissues, and webs of Nephila pilipes across mangroves with varying pollution levels, using quantitative fatty acid signature analysis (QFASA) to estimate spider diets. Significantly elevated concentrations of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), alternative halogenated flame retardants (AHFRs), hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs), and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) were observed in all matrixes from heavily polluted areas, driven by habitat contamination and dietary intake. Concentrations of HCHs, PCBs, PBDEs, and AHFRs in spider webs were highly correlated with those in spider tissues (cephalothorax and abdomen; p < 0.05), whereas DDTs and HBCDs exhibited weak correlations (only in the abdomen; p < 0.05), and TBBPA showed no significant correlation, potentially attributed to compound-specific properties and web characteristics. Integration of HOC concentrations in spider webs with chemical properties (log KOW, log KOA, and molecular weight) yielded significant correlations with biomagnification factors (R2 = 0.415–0.539, p < 0.01) and with tissue HOC levels (R2 = 0.511–0.795, p < 0.001), supporting predictive models for biomagnification and tissue partitioning. These findings underscore the potential of spider webs as noninvasive, sustainable bioindicators that integrate pollutant data to enhance ecological risk assessments and pollution monitoring in sensitive ecosystems, providing a viable alternative to destructive sampling."

Lechtenfeld,Temporal Dynamics and Intermediate Product Formation in DOM Phototransformation Revealed by Liquid Chromatography Ultrahigh-Resolution Mass Spectrometry,"The complex composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) has been extensively studied by modern high-resolution analytical methods. However, DOM reactivity is still enigmatic due to a lack of experimental data with sufficiently high temporal resolution to resolve the intrinsic dynamics within DOM. Likewise, extensive isomeric overlap prevents studying transformation of DOM components with respect to their chemical properties, e.g., molecular polarity. Online ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography with ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-UHRMS) increases the resolution of isomeric DOM composition across a wide range of polarity. We performed a TiO2-aided photo-irradiation experiment with wastewater treatment plant effluent with high temporal sampling resolution (8 time points, 5 h irradiation). Besides new products (<10%) and removed components (25–60%), intermediate products (IntP) were also found, representing 20–60% of components within distinct polarity fractions. The reaction time to reach the peak magnitude maximum was positively related to the H/C ratio of IntP. About 35% of the DOM components showed different reactivities for different polarity fractions. If applied to experiments in the future, our approach offers new perspectives for biogeochemical interpretation and provides important information for drinking water processing or wastewater treatment with respect to potential toxic IntP."

This study classified 35 typical LCMs into three groups based on structure, namely, fluorinated LCMs (Group A, without ether or nitrile groups), cyanated LCMs (Group B, with nitrile functional groups), and others with ether bonds or unsubstituted benzene rings (Group C). For the distribution in mice, LCMs predominantly accumulated in adipose tissue, with mean concentrations of 502 ng g–1 (Group A) > 159 ng g–1 (Group B) ≈ 147 ng g–1 (Group C). All 35 LCMs were detectable in feces, with a log Kow of 9 as a critical threshold distinguishing gradual versus rapid excretion. Nine stable, frequently detected LCMs were selected for RBA assessment in indoor dust using adipose tissue as the biological end point. The RBA of the 9 LCMs in dust ranged from 8.32 to 108%, highlighting that assuming 100% bioavailability would overestimate the exposure risk of LCMs in dust. A significantly negative correlation (p < 0.01) was found between the total organic carbon (TOC) content of dust and RBA, likely due to the strong adsorption of LCMs by TOC."

In this work, the most common ligand, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), was used to enhance Mn(II) activation of periodate (PI, IO4–) for the degradation of the sulfisoxazole (SIZ). Chromatographic analysis of EDTA showed that EDTA, like SIZ, also exhibits self-accelerated degradation in this system. This suggests that the accelerated degradation of pollutants may be closely related to the structural changes of Mn(II)-EDTA. Oxidative pretreatment of Mn(II)-EDTA showed that the decay of Mn(II)-EDTA was accompanied by the disappearance of the self-accelerated degradation characteristic of the pollutants. Mass spectrometry analysis suggested that the decarboxymethylation of Mn(II)-EDTA to Mn(II)-ED3A is an important pathway for its structural transformation. The standard ED3A exhibited superior assistance to the Mn(II)/PI system compared to EDTA, without showing the self-accelerated degradation trend. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that Mn(II)-ED3A more readily reacts with PI, and the corresponding oxygen transfer product (O–Mn(IV)-ED3A)− possesses stronger oxidative properties. A series of mechanistic investigations confirmed the formation of transient Mn-oxo species, accompanied by the generation of hydroxyl radicals (•OH) as secondary radicals in the system. The degradation of SIZ primarily involves processes such as hydrolysis, hydroxylation, and nitration, accompanied by the attenuation of toxicity. This study provides mechanistic insights into the evolution of ligands in the Mn(II)/EDTA/PI system and highlights the need for greater attention to structural changes of organic ligands in catalytic oxidation systems."

While the EPA’s high-cost Federal Reference Methods and Federal Equivalent Methods provide reliable data, they are often sparsely distributed, limiting community-scale assessments. Low-cost sensors like PurpleAir (PA) offer a promising alternative but require careful location-specific calibration and correction for environmental influences. Although several correction factors have been developed for use across regions and nationwide, these models often exhibit bias due to the predominance of data from temperate and warmer climates. This study was conducted to evaluate the performance of PA sensors in measuring PM2.5 in extremely cold environments, specifically North Pole, Alaska. Data from PA sensors and a Beta Attenuation Monitoring (BAM) reference sensor were used to develop correction models. The study found that temperature and relative humidity significantly influenced PA sensor accuracy in the region. By comparing various regression models, including Ordinary Least Squares, Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net, an optimal model was identified that substantially reduced errors and aligned PA sensor data with BAM measurements. This research highlights the importance of localized calibration models to enhance the reliability of low-cost air quality sensors in diverse environmental conditions, particularly in cold regions."

Yde,Meteorological Impact of Glacier Retreat and Proglacial Lake Temperature in Western Norway,"Glaciers are retreating worldwide, yet, little is known about the influence of these changes on local weather and climate in glacial landscapes. Changes in glacier extent and proglacial lakes alter the thermodynamic forcing in glacier‐lake‐valley systems, and it is still an open question if their importance for future microclimate is greater than direct effects of global warming. To study the impact of these changes, we combine the first set of high‐density spatiotemporal observations of a glacier‐lake‐valley system at Nigardsbreen in western Norway with high‐resolution numerical simulations from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The sensitivity of the thermodynamic circulation to glacier extent and proglacial lakes is tested using glacier outlines from 2006 to 2019 and varying lake surface temperature. The model represents the evolution of glacier winds and cold air pools well when thermal forcing dominates over large‐scale forcing. During a persistent down‐glacier wind regime, the glacier‐valley circulation is sensitive to lake temperature and glacier extent, with strong impacts on wind speed, convection in the valley, and interaction with mountain waves. However, when the large‐scale forcing dominates and the down‐glacier wind is weak and shallower, impacts on atmospheric circulation are smaller, especially those related to lake temperature. This high sensitivity to meteorological conditions is related to whether the wind regime promotes thermal coupling between the glacier and the lake. The findings of this study highlight the need for accurate representation of glacier extent and proglacial lakes when evaluating local effects of past and future climate change in glacial regions."

Báez,Digital Holographic Microscopy and Machine Learning for Quantitative 3D Analysis and Automatic Classification of Volcanic Ash Particles,"Determining the shapes, sizes and optical properties of volcanic ash presents a significant challenge in volcanology, the aviation industry and atmospheric models involving transport and dispersion of particles. Eruptive dynamics, including fragmentation mechanisms, magma viscosity and particle transport processes, among others, are encoded in the intricate shapes and sizes of these particles. Traditionally, the analysis of ash particles' morphology has relied on quantitative non‐dimensional parameters, primarily derived from their 2D silhouette projected area, using conventional microscopy or particle analyzers. However, these fail to capture the 3D structure of their morphology. Additionally, atmospheric dispersion models often assume spherical particles with uniform refractive indices, introducing uncertainties in particle size estimations and dispersion calculations. In this study, we introduce a novel 3D characterization method for volcanic ash using digital holographic microscopy (DHM) combined with machine learning (ML). We implemented an off‐axis interferometer to register holograms of volcanic ash samples. We show that segmented phase maps from the reconstructed holograms can be used to derive both 2D and 3D phase‐based morphological parameters for individual ash particles or to estimate their refractive index. To illustrate the potential of this technique, we analyzed morphological differences between ashes acccording to their transport mechanism: fallout and flow. A ML algorithm based on support vector machine (SVM) was trained to classify particles into one of these two categories, achieving an average accuracy of 76%. These results show that the proposed approach serves as a valuable tool for monitoring volcanic eruptions providing insights on their characteristics and associated environmental impact."

However, the anthropogenic fingerprint in past and future changes in daily CHEs and the corresponding population exposure remain unclear. Here, using a fingerprint‐based detection and attribution method, we quantify contributions of different external forcings to the historical increase in CHEs by defining three daily scale metrics: the probability ratio (PR) of CHEs and the proportion of CHEs in the number of extreme hot days/nights (PTday/PTnight). All three metrics increased significantly by 117.9%, 128.7%, and 133.4% globally from 1950 to 2014. It is very likely (>90%) for human to leave fingerprints in increasing daily CHEs. The increases in PR, PTday, and PTnight that are attributable to greenhouse gas emissions are 121.2%, 123.1%, and 121.5%, respectively. By the end of the 21st century under a high‐emission scenario, fingerprint‐constrained projections show the PR of CHEs will be about 60 times higher than the climatological period, with around 41% of hot days and 49% of hot nights as CHEs, reducing the magnitude compared to raw projections. In some regions such as mid and high‐latitudes, almost all daytime or nighttime extreme‐heat events would become CHEs. The growing difference between CHE days per person and per unit of land area suggests that CHEs will disproportionately affect densely populated areas. Our results indicate that adaptive measures are required to alleviate the increasing proportion of CHEs and the disproportionate population exposure in densely populated areas."

 The 87Sr/86Sr isotopic ratio has emerged as a valuable geochemical tracer in fields such as environmental forensics, archaeology, and provenance research. However, generating accurate and spatially continuous isoscape maps from sparse isotopic measurements remains a major challenge due to limited data availability and spatial heterogeneity. To address this, we propose a hybrid framework for 87Sr/86Sr isoscape mapping that integrates a kriging-based data augmentation method with a deep learning (DL) classifier. The kriging component generates synthetic training samples by interpolating sparse isotopic data while preserving underlying spatial correlations and geological anisotropy. These augmented data, along with spatial geological features (e.g., lithology, tectonic settings) and geochemical compositions, are used as input variables for training a feedforward deep neural network. The approach was applied to 409 soil samples collected across South Korea, and its performance was benchmarked against conventional kriging and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The proposed model achieved significantly higher classification accuracy (91.67%) compared to kriging-based and CNN-based models (76.7% and 86.7%, respectively). Furthermore, the isoscape outputs revealed meaningful isotopic patterns linked to geological and geomorphological controls, such as metamorphic rock distributions, fault density, and surface slope. This framework demonstrates the effectiveness of combining geostatistics with DL to improve predictive accuracy and interpretability in isotopic provenance research and environmental monitoring."

 Photolysis and gas-phase reaction schemes (PHS and GRS, respectively) are two modules that significantly influence the modeling performance of tropospheric ozone in chemical transport models (CTMs). Quantifying the impacts of updating both PHS and GRS on simulated ozone has significant implications for effectively improving the modeling performance of CTMs, which has not been previously studied. In this study, based on the architecture of multi-option scientific modules in the Emission and atmospheric Processes Integrated and Coupled Community (EPICC)-Model, two PHSs (a highly parameterized approach (EXPR) and a streamlined version of the TUV model (STUV)) and two GRSs (CBMZ and CB6r5) were developed to assess their impacts on simulated tropospheric ozone concentrations in the North China Plain during winter and summer. Compared to the cbmzEXPR scheme, the cb6r5STUV scheme showed a significant improvement in ozone simulation performance in both winter and summer, with the normalized mean bias of the maximum daily 8-h average ozone improving from −0.24 to −0.10 in winter and from 0.11 to −0.01 in summer. These improvements were attributed to better representation of photolysis rates by STUV, along with a more detailed description of gas-phase reactions by CB6r5 with distinct seasonal effects. In winter, updates of the GRS dominated the total improvement, with a contribution of 2.29 ppb (91 %) to daytime ozone changes. In summer, updates of the PHS played a dominant role, contributing −6.58 ppb (66 %) to daytime ozone changes. This study highlights the importance of simultaneously updating the PHS and GRS in CTMs to achieve better ozone simulation performance."

 Accurately profiling the vertical distribution of particulate matter (PM) remains challenging. This study presents a novel approach for retrieving vertical PM concentrations using a single coherent Doppler lidar (CDL) combined with machine learning (ML) models. The models were trained using in-situ PM2.5 and PM10 data as true values, along with input features including the particle extinction coefficient at 1550 nm, signal-to-noise ratio, wind speed, wind direction from CDL observations, as well as temperature and relative humidity from ERA5 reanalysis data. Observations from Qingdao, China, during winter and spring (2020–2024) were used for model development and evaluation. The models show good performance that the R2, RMSE, MAE of the PM2.5 test set comparison are 0.787, 18.11 μg/m3, 11.23 μg/m3, and those of the PM10 test set are 0.803 and 29.98 μg/m3, 18.93 μg/m3, respectively. Case studies of haze and dust events demonstrated the capability of this method in capturing and characterizing vertical PM distribution. From the statistical results, the PM layers of the typical haze and dust events in Qingdao were primarily concentrated within 1 km and 1.2 km in altitude, respectively. With the atmospheric dynamics information including wind speed and vertical velocity provided by CDL, the evidence can be found that the enhancement of wind speed and negative vertical velocity in the later phase of the PM events may result in the dissipation and deposition of the PM. Combining the PM backward trajectory simulation, the results show that the haze event during the Chinese Spring Festival in Qingdao was influenced by both local emissions and regional transport, while the dust event in the spring exhibited multi-phase structures driven by long-range transport. This CDL-based approach provides a promising pathway for three-dimensional PM observation with atmospheric dynamics information, offering the potential to enhance air quality monitoring through expanded CDL networks and ML applications."

 Accurate precipitation forecasts are crucial for societal development and safety, particularly during extreme precipitation events. Current Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models have been widely used and play a key role in precipitation forecasts, however, systematic biases persist. Consequently, statistical methods and deep learning models have been proposed for the post-processing of precipitation forecasts, which improve the original forecasts to a certain degree. However, owing to the highly nonlinear and nonstationary nature of precipitation, these methods fail to perform adequately for extreme precipitation. Thus, in this study, we first proposed a novel deep learning model, coupling the Long Short-Term Memory and Nonstationary Transformer (LNT), to capture nonstationary precipitation features. Second, we designed a novel loss function, called the generalized exponential likelihood (GEL) loss function to capture extreme precipitation by balancing clustering and outlier features. Furthermore, we proposed a dual-layer dynamic learning rate adjustment strategy (A) for handling dynamic learning demands to get the global optimal solution and the higher precision of post-processing. The dataset from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) was used as inputs for the models in the experimental post-processing of daily precipitation forecasts. The results show that precipitation post-processed by the LNT_GEL_A outperformed the original ECMWF forecasts and the other models. Particularly, at the lead time of 240 h, when the precipitation was above 50.0 mm/d, LNT_GEL_A could better balance the precipitation intensity and reliability, with a CORR of 0.66, the lowest RMSE (14.95 mm/d), and a probability of detection (POD) of 0.8. Additionally, the LNT_GEL_A model demonstrated superior performance in capturing high precipitation areas during the spatial distribution analysis of typical extreme precipitation events. Overall, the proposed LNT_GEL_A model offers an innovative approach, enhancing the precision of original precipitation forecasts and providing valuable insights for post-processing short- and medium-term daily precipitation forecasts."
