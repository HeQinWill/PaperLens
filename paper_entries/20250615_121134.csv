Here, we developed an Ecopath model for the East China Sea (ECS) with 45 functional groups and constructed an Ecosim model with 15 scenarios, using fishing effort (FE) and sea surface temperature (SST) as driving variables. The resistance resilience stability (RRS) index was proposed to quantify the comprehensive changes in total biomass and stability of the ECS under dual pressures from 2000 to 2100. SST increase led to biomass declines eight to 12 times greater than FE increase, though 63.06% of economic species were negatively affected by rising FE. Notably, several key economic species may face the risk of extinction by the end of the century under a 10% FE increase and 4.0 °C SST rise. This will pose a significant disturbance to the ecosystem stability. However, our results suggest that reducing FE to 50% of current levels and limiting SST rise to within 1.5 °C could effectively prevent a further biomass reduction and keep the RRS index within reasonable limits. The research contributes to a quantitative analysis of ecosystem stability under dual pressures, providing a scientific basis for sustainable fishery resource management."

Herein, carbon doped Pt catalysts supported on SBA-15 (PtCx/SBA-15) were prepared by ethane (C2H6) heat treatment on SBA-15 supported Pt catalysts (Pt/SBA-15). Characterization results disclose that carbon atoms are successfully introduced in Pt particles, forming unique PtCx active sites. The PtCx active sites exhibit strong C2H4 adsorption and activation ability, enhanced hydrophobicity, and high catalytic activity for CO oxidation. As a result, PtCx/SBA-15 catalysts exhibit much higher C2H4 conversion and CO2 yield than Pt/SBA-15 catalysts at 0 °C. Particularly, 3PtCx/SBA-15 maintains 100% conversion of 50 ppm of C2H4 for more than 7 h and even displays 93.2% C2H4 conversion and 88.8% CO2 yield after 20 h of time-on-stream (TOS), exhibiting unprecedentedly prominent catalytic performance. This study provides a universal and efficient strategy to accurately enhance the surface hydrophobicity of noble metal particles employed in the low-temperature catalytic oxidation of C2H4. More importantly, it opens a new pathway for constructing highly active catalysts from the perspective of accelerating the oxidation of intermediate species to achieve improved utilization efficiency of active sites."

The fate of nascent particles is dependent on their ability to take up water, a process influenced by particle size, composition, and morphology. However, there is a lack of comprehensive characterization of the hygroscopic properties of sub-20 nm particles that are compositionally similar to those of atmospheric new particles, leading to uncertainties in predicting their growth and survival. In this study, we examine the hygroscopic properties of particles composed of both inorganic (NaCl and gas-phase reaction products of sulfuric acid and ammonia) and organic components (derived from α-pinene oxidation) by tandem differential mobility analysis. For NaCl-organic particles, we find that the organic coating reduces the particle deliquescence relative humidity (DRH), efflorescence relative humidity (ERH), and hygroscopic growth factor (GF). These reductions are size-dependent, but the Zdanovskii–Stokes–Robinson (ZSR) rule successfully predicts the particle GF once the Kelvin effect is considered. In contrast, particles containing sulfuric acid-ammonia reaction products exhibit no well-defined DRH or ERH. These particles, which are rich in acids, progressively approach the behavior of ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4) as their size increases. The ZSR rule underestimates the particle GF, possibly due to partial mixing of the organic and aqueous phases. Based on our experimental data, simulations of particle growth show that incorporating hygroscopic growth is essential for accurately estimating particle survival probabilities, even at moderate relative humidity. Our findings enhance the understanding of the factors governing water uptake by atmospheric new particles and contribute to the development of more accurate models for simulating new particle growth."

In this study, we collected matched samples of indoor dust, drinking water, and urine from 81 households in Indiana, United States, and analyzed these samples for 82 CUPs, including 48 insecticides, 25 herbicides, and 9 fungicides. Of these, 47 CUPs were identified across samples of indoor dust, drinking water, and urine with median total CUP (∑CUP) concentrations of 18 300 ng/g, 101 ng/L, and 2.93 ng/mL, respectively. Notably, concentrations of neonicotinoids (NEOs) in indoor dust were higher than those reported in other studies. Herbicides were the most abundant CUPs detected in drinking water, constituting 55% of the ∑CUP concentrations. Insecticides were the most abundant CUP group detected in urine (median total insecticide concentration: 2.30 ng/mL), followed by herbicides (median: 0.409 ng/mL) and fungicides (median: 0.0531 ng/mL). The highest estimated daily intake (EDI) from drinking water and dust exposure was found for imidacloprid, with a median value of 1.00 ng/kg of body weight/day. Our results show that indoor dust is a significant exposure pathway for most insecticides and fungicides, while herbicides are mainly consumed through drinking water. In addition, the toxicity equivalent factor model, incorporated with data retrieved from the ToxCast database, indicated that imidacloprid poses the greatest health risk based on its high exposure levels and toxicity. This study underscores the importance of monitoring CUPs in indoor environments and sheds light on their potential health risks."

However, during this transformation, the reduction capacity of the Fe(II)aq–Fe(III) oxyhydroxide system evolves substantially over time and its impacts on contaminant attenuation processes remain unclear. In this study, a single quantitative relationship between contaminant reduction rates (ksa) and shifts in the reduction capacity during the ferrihydrite transformation (log(ksa) = 0.91·(−EH/59 mV – pH) + 2.96) was established using nitrobenzene as a representative contaminant, despite variations in transformation pathways and product assemblages at different pH values and Fe(II)aq concentrations. The reduction capacity of such systems was dependent on the iron oxide composition when ferrihydrite was transformed to more thermodynamically stable Fe(III) oxyhydroxides. EH decreased from 1.5 and – 46.8 mV to −113.1 and −136.5 mV (all measurements vs. a standard hydrogen electrode) as ferrihydrite transformed to lepidocrocite and goethite, respectively. When structural Fe(II)-containing magnetite was formed, decreases in the pH and Fe(II)aq concentration increased EH from −159.7 to −79.9 mV. This work provides an effective method for predicting the abiotic attenuation of organic contaminants during complex mineral transformation processes and deepens our understanding of the natural transformation behavior of contaminants in aquifers."

Despite their advantages, the use of 3D fish cell models in toxicological studies remains limited. This study aims to characterize the lipidomic and gene expression profiles of zebrafish liver (ZFL) spheroids and evaluate their metabolic and functional differences compared to those of conventional monolayer cultures. Seven-day-old spheroids (400 μm diameter) exhibited increased levels of neutral lipids─cholesterol esters (CEs) and diacylglycerols (DGs)─alongside reduced expression of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis (fasn, acc, and scebf1) compared to cell monolayers. This suggests a metabolic shift from lipid synthesis to lipid storage. Additionally, spheroids showed a reorganization of membrane lipids, with an increased ratio of phosphatidylcholines (PCs) to phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs) and elevated levels of phospholipids containing long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6). Upon exposure to β-naphthoflavone (BNF), the spheroids showed a markedly higher expression of cyp1a (650-fold) compared to monolayers (57-fold increase), indicating increased metabolic competence. Overall, ZFL spheroids represent a more mature and functionally relevant hepatocyte model than cell monolayers, particularly in terms of lipid composition and metabolic function. The study highlights the importance of lipidomic studies in characterizing 3D models and provides valuable insights into molecular changes associated with spheroid maturation."

The oxygenation of Fe(II) under oxic conditions produces hydroxyl radicals (•OH). However, the influence of PC on this process remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of PC on •OH generation during ferrihydrite transformation by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 at the redox interfaces. The results showed that PC increased •OH generation by 2.3–6.5-fold during the oxygenation of Fe(II) and this enhancement correlated with the redox properties of PC. Electrochemical analysis indicated that PC decreased the redox potential of Fe(II) and facilitated the interfacial electron transfer of Fe(II), thereby increasing Fe(II) oxidation by 33–86%. PC mediated electron transfer from Fe(II) to O2 to sequentially generate O2•–, H2O2, and •OH through oxygen-containing functional groups and graphitic structures. During the decomposition of H2O2 by Fe(II) to produce •OH, PC inhibited Fe(IV) formation by preventing O-atom transfer from H2O2 to Fe(II) and promoted •OH generation by facilitating electron transfer from Fe(II) to H2O2. Consequently, PC increased •OH generation efficiency by 2.9–3.3-fold, making a major contribution to the enhanced •OH generation than to the increased Fe(II) oxidation (9–13% at most). This study improves our understanding of the effect of PC on Fe cycling and provides mechanistic insights into PC-enhanced •OH generation from the oxygenation of Fe(II) during the microbial transformation of Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides at redox interfaces."

This study aims to examine the association between energy burden and CKD prevalence across 500 U.S. cities by using nationally representative data sets. Utilizing propensity score matching and a random intercept analysis, we found that census tracts with high energy burden were significantly associated with a 0.195 higher chronic kidney prevalence [95% CI: 0.144–0.246] compared to those with low energy burden, after adjusting key observed characteristics such as living, housing, and sociodemographic conditions of census tracts. Other risk factors contributing to increased CKD prevalence included older building age, higher percentages of nonwhite populations and older adults, lower educational levels, and lower average household incomes. The findings highlight that energy burden is not merely a financial problem but rather a social determinant of CKD health and a significant risk factor for increased CKD prevalence in U.S. urban areas. Our results indicate that state and local energy assistance programs may serve as important interventions not only for improving kidney health outcomes but also for reducing health disparities in the U.S."

Druhan,Deep Roots Supply Reactivity and Enhance Silicate Weathering in the Bedrock Vadose Zone,"In upland environments, roots commonly extend deep below soil into partially saturated bedrock. This Bedrock Vadose Zone (BVZ) has been shown to store and circulate water, host organic carbon respiration and serve as a critical source of rock‐derived nutrients. However, the extent to which deep roots influence chemical weathering rates remains poorly understood. Here, we report 4 years of depth‐resolved major ion chemistry over a 16‐m thick BVZ hosting a deep rhizosphere in a catchment subject to a Mediterranean climate. These data allow development and validation of a reactive transport model (RTM), revealing that the timescales of water storage and drainage in the BVZ are sufficient to facilitate substantial chemical weathering of the shale bedrock. However, observed solute concentrations are only reproduced by the RTM when we explicitly include measured rates of CO2(g) ${\text{CO}}_{2(g)}$ production meters below soil driven by the deeply rooted forest. By combining direct observations and a process‐based RTM we conclude that the carbon respiration promoted by deep roots significantly enhances chemical weathering rates in the BVZ, constituting 43% ± $\pm $ 3% of total solute flux from the base of the BVZ to the water table."

Achieving these objectives requires accurate reconstruction of wind speeds and wind directions that assimilate real‐time observations, but current methods used for such reconstructions remain computationally expensive and challenging to solve highly nonlinear equations. By selecting multiple regions in the Pacific Ocean as case studies, we explore the fusion of sparse scatterometer observations from different satellites with physics‐informed neural networks (PINNs) to reconstruct large‐scale sea surface wind fields, effectively integrating observations and filling data gaps. The result demonstrates that PINNs can efficiently reconstruct full realistic wind fields from sparse data at a low computation cost. Moreover, we propose a novel loss function that can preserve fine‐scale details while capturing the key features of the wind field. Evaluation against reference data sets, including buoy measurements, ERA5, and cross‐calibrated multiplatform (CCMP) wind speed and direction, highlights the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method. Compared to the reanalysis data of ERA5 and CCMP, the wind field reconstructed by the PINN closely aligns with the observation. These findings underscore the potential of the PINN technique as an alternative, computationally efficient approach for operational sea surface wind reconstruction."

 Antarctica, once considered pristine, is increasingly threatened by plastic pollution, with debris found in its waters, sediments, sea ice, and biota. Here, we provide a comprehensive molecular survey of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic diversity on plastics around the Antarctic Peninsula, addressing a gap in existing research. Using eDNA metabarcoding, we identified diverse communities, with Pseudomonadota and Bacteroidota dominating prokaryotic communities, while Gyrista (mostly diatoms), Fungi and Arthropods were prevalent among eukaryotes. Geographic location significantly influenced community composition, with differences between the Bransfield Strait and the Gerlache Strait/Bellingshausen Sea.

 Compared with those provided by polar-orbiting satellites/sensors (e.g., Landsat/MODIS), new-generation geostationary satellites, such as Himawari-8 and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R series (GOES-R), offer temporally continuous and much more frequent observations of the land surface over the course of the diurnal cycle. In this study, Himawari-8 land surface temperature (LST) data and GLASS leaf area index (LAI) were assimilated into a coupled two-source surface energy balance–vegetation dynamics model (TSEB-VDM) via the variational data assimilation (VDA) method to retrieve the regional sensible heat flux (H), latent heat flux (LE), and gross primary productivity (GPP) (hereafter referred to as the VDAHimawari-8 scheme). Regional H, LE, and GPP values were estimated across the Heihe River Basin (HRB) in northwestern China, with a spatial resolution of 0.02° × 0.02°. Moreover, LST data from the MODIS, which is an instrument onboard polar-orbiting satellites (i.e., Terra and Aqua), were assimilated into the TSEB-VDM model (hereafter referred to as the VDAMODIS scheme) for comparison with the VDAHimawari-8 scheme. Four unknown parameters of the TSEB-VDM model, i.e., the neutral bulk heat transfer coefficient (CHN), the evaporative fractions of the soil and canopy (EFS and EFC, respectively), and the specific leaf area, were optimized via the VDA approach. The estimated H and LE values were validated against ground measurements from the large-aperture scintillator, and the GPP estimates were validated against eddy covariance data at three sites (Arou, Daman, and Sidaoqiao) in the HRB. The results indicated that the assimilation of geostationary satellite-based LST data significantly improved the performance of the VDA model. The three-site-average root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the H, LE, and GPP estimates from the VDAMODIS scheme were 45.27 W m−2, 83.77 W m−2, and 3.30 g C m−2 d−1, respectively. Compared with the VDAMODIS scheme, the VDAHimawari-8 scheme notably enhanced the performance of the VDA framework and decreased the RMSE by 15.0 % for H, 22.5 % for LE, and 38.5 % for the GPP, with an especially notable enhancement in humid (or vegetated) areas. The primary factors contributing to the enhancement in the performance of the VDA framework were the availability of much more frequent LST observations and the diurnal sampling capability of the Himawari-8 satellite."

 The impacts of climate change pose significant challenges to global forest ecosystems, particularly in Mediterranean evergreen forests dominated by Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.). Since the CLMS 10-daily Gross Dry Matter Productivity (GDMP) product represents the potential productivity and, by definition, does not account for water stress, this study aims to evaluate and improve the Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) estimation based on GDMP for these forests. To achieve this, we assessed the GDMP-derived GPP (RS-GPPst) against eddy covariance GPP data (EC-GPP) from six Aleppo pine forest stands across the Mediterranean basin, covering 30 site-years and spanning a climatic gradient from semi-arid to semi-humid conditions. Additionally, we analyzed the ecophysiological response of Aleppo pine to drought, focusing on environmental factors such as temperature and water stress (i.e., atmospheric based on vapor pressure deficit and edaphic based on soil water content) to refine the GPP model. Our results indicated that the RS-GPPst underestimates EC-GPP during cold periods. Using ERA5-Land data, we proposed a simplified approach to remove the temperature limitation factor and incorporated a soil water content factor, which significantly enhanced model accuracy, reduced uncertainty, and improved precision. The soil water-corrected GPP model achieved a Pearson correlation of r = 0.85, a negligible bias, and an RMSE of 1.1 gC m−2 d−1, providing a more accurate representation of GPP across varying climatic conditions. These findings highlight the importance of identifying and integrating key limiting environmental stressors, particularly water stress, into GPP models for water-limited ecosystems. The improved model, relying solely on remote sensing data without requiring in-situ measurements, offers a robust approach for large-scale carbon cycle monitoring."

 The surveillance and detection of civil aircraft over a wide area has long been a technical challenge, with no available datasets and complete detection methods yet. The first global space-based three-channels thermal infrared flying civil aircraft dataset (TIFAD.v1) is established by this paper, covering 17 months, six continents, with 21,004 aircraft and 1252 contrail aircraft, integrating ADS-B civil aviation data. TIFAD.v1 is a fine-grained dataset of small flying targets with aircraft type, calibrated altitude, ground speed, and track. We investigates the radiative feature of high-altitude flying targets and finds that their thermal radiation peaks are primarily distributed in the 10.3–12.5 μm band. Additionally, a significant altitude-dependent difference in transmittance is observed at 11.72 μm, which helps suppress background interference and enhances the reliability of target detection. And an innovative detection method for wide-area flying target is developed, combined YOLOv11n-based deep learning algorithms with in-situ radiative characteristics including the top of atmosphere radiance, temperature contrast, SCR to enhance detection accuracy. This technology provides an effective and robust new approach for all-weather detection of maneuverable flight targets on a global scale, demonstrating the significant potential of intelligent technology in the field of thermal infrared remote sensing applications. Moreover the in situ data allows for quantitative measurement of the radiative feature of flight targets, providing essential data for research on infrared and atmospheric transmittance."

 In recent years, increasing wildfire activity in the western United States has led to significant emissions of smoke aerosols, impacting the atmospheric energy balance through their absorption and scattering properties. Single scattering albedo (SSA) is a key parameter that governs these radiative effects, but accurately retrieving SSA from satellites remains challenging due to limitations in sensor resolution, low sensitivity of traditional remote sensing methods, and uncertainties in radiative transfer modeling, particularly from surface reflectance and aerosol characterization. Smoke optical properties evolve rapidly after emission, influenced by fuel type, combustion conditions, and chemical aging. Accurate SSA retrieval near the source thus requires high-temporal-resolution satellite observations. Critical Reflectance (CR) method provides this capability by identifying a unique reflectance value at which top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance becomes insensitive to aerosol loading and primarily reflects aerosol absorption. SSA can be retrieved from this critical reflectance. This study presents a geostationary-based CR method using the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) on GOES-R satellites. The approach leverages ABI’s high temporal (5–10 min) and spatial (3 km) resolution, consistent viewing geometry, and wide coverage. A tailored look-up table, based on an AOD-dependent smoke model for North America, links CR to SSA. Case studies show strong agreement with AERONET measurements, with retrieval differences mostly within 0.01—well below AERONET’s ±0.03 uncertainty. The method captures temporal and spatial variations in smoke absorption and demonstrates robustness across daylight hours. This GEO-based CR approach offers an effective tool for high-resolution SSA retrieval, contributing to improved aerosol radiative forcing estimates and climate modeling."

 Snowmelt provides critical water resources that impact ecosystem health and hazard frequency; however, the timing of melt is difficult to infer across large spatial scales. While Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been used to detect snowmelt onset, the accuracy of different methodological approaches requires evaluation. We use Sentinel-1 SAR observations to estimate snowmelt timing at automated snow water equivalent (SWE) stations (n = 52) across British Columbia between 2018 and 2021. The timing of backscatter minima are compared to snowmelt onset estimates derived from continuous SWE and surface air temperature records. First, we develop a manual selection method, which requires SWE and air temperature records, to determine the feasibility of SAR for estimating snowmelt onset. Using this approach, we demonstrate that images with identical viewing geometries (i.e., those from the same orbital track) should be utilized for snowmelt onset estimation with SAR, and that including the timing of local minima, a minimum value over an interval, as potential dates of snowmelt initiation increases accuracy compared to the use of absolute minima alone. Accuracy further increases when snowmelt analysis is constrained to specific timeframes informed by region and topography, with error reduced by greater than 50 % in some study years. After demonstrating the potential accuracy of SAR with manually selected estimates (RMSE = 5.3 d), we develop an automated method that can produce SAR estimates of melt onset that are independent of surface observations. While accuracy was reduced from automated approaches, the mean date of absolute backscatter minima in track-separated SAR time series (both cross and co-polarized images) provided the most accurate automated estimates of snowmelt (RMSE = 11 d). We observed no spatially coherent bias in SAR error which suggests that SAR observations can be used to detect snowmelt onset across large regions."

 This paper contributes to developing novel ensemble models for delineating flood-prone areas in a West African context. One critical West African city with a history of flooding in Ghana, the Cape Coast Metropolis (CCM), was chosen with flood inventories, comprising 70% training and 30% validation, prepared as the basis for accurate prediction modeling. Furthermore, 13 conditioning parameters were chosen via multicollinearity evaluation. Three bivariate statistical algorithms, namely evidential belief function (EBF), relative frequency ratio (RFR), and Shannon entropy (SE) were combined through basic arithmetic operations to produce nine ensemble scenarios. Model performances were adjudged using the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC/ROC) ratings and the overall best-performing model with a predictive accuracy of 99.6% was selected. Based on the findings, CCM’s total area was categorized into very low (20.0%), low (22.1%), moderate (20.2%), high (18.8%), and very high (18.9%) susceptibility zones. Moreover, the resultant map revealed middle portions down to the coast are most sensitive to floods compared to the northern part due to flat slope surfaces, decreasing vegetative cover, and low elevated lands. These delineated flood zones have substantial implications for national and local flood management to proactively plan and manage floods within the region and contribute to the global agenda of sustainable cities and communities."

 Accurate and timely information on the spatiotemporal distribution of crops is essential for sustainable agricultural practices and ensuring food security. The significant challenges persist in accurately classifying crop types in highly fragmented cropland regions characterized by small field sizes, complex landscapes, and highly frequent cloud cover. This study presents a novel classification workflow designed to generate archaic/historic and reliable land cover (LC) maps from integrating time series data from multiple EO sources—Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and the Highly Scalable Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (HISTARFM)—with the Random Forest (RF) classifier and cloud computing technology. To the evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, Northeast (NE) Thailand was selected as a case study region, focusing on the classification of 14 crop types between 2021 and 2023. Different combinations of EO datasets and a RF classifier were evaluated using a substantial dataset of 13,453 reference points. The crop type/LC transitions from 2021 to 2023 were then analysed and a temporal transfer model was employed to map historical crop fields. The combined all EO datasets in this work achieved high overall accuracy and F1 scores (>85 %) with the high spatial consistency of crop fields when compared to the use of combined both datasets. Results demonstrated the high potential and excellent efficiency of the RF, utilising an extensive reference dataset and the continuous temporal monthly information of gap-filled data. The most dominant crops were rice, followed by cassava, sugarcane and rubber trees throughout the three study years. The transfer learning RF model proved effective in mapping historical crop types and LC even when ground data was limited. Transitions of 7,287 km2 (∼5%) appeared from 2021 to 2022, with major crop decreases in rice and sugarcane. From 2022 to 2023, cropland changes totaled 8,466 km2 (∼6%), primarily as reductions in sugarcane and rubber trees.

 The impact of wildfire smoke on surface air quality is examined for one of the largest metro areas in the United States (Phoenix, Arizona) as a case study of urban areas in arid regions. While many studies have examined direct smoke impacts at surface level, the present work seeks to also identify the composite impact of smoke throughout the atmospheric column on surface air quality. O3 and PM2.5 concentrations increased on smoke days compared to no smoke days, although increases in these pollutants were not distributed equally across the study region. O3 and PM2.5 showed concurrent increases on smoke days, while no relationship between the two was found for no smoke days. Smoke days tended to have higher mean daily air temperatures than no smoke days (34.1 °C vs. 32.9 °C, respectively). Given that the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for O3 was exceeded on 51 % of smoke days compared to 28 % of no smoke days examined, results of this work highlight the need to understand the mechanisms by which wildfire smoke throughout the atmospheric column impacts surface air quality to develop effective strategies for protecting vulnerable populations and improving air quality."

 Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a key parameter for evaluating climate change and air quality, yet ground-based AOD observations in China remain limited, and satellite data often suffer from acquisition gaps due to cloud cover. Surface visibility (VIS) offers a promising alternative for AOD retrieval, but the relationship between VIS and AOD is complex and shaped by multiple factors such as meteorological conditions, the vertical distribution of aerosols, topography, and population density. This study systematically explored the influence of these factors on the hourly VIS–AOD relationship, using over ∼2300 automatic VIS measurements and Himawari-8 satellite-retrieved AOD data collected across China from 2016 to 2021. The results reveal significant spatiotemporal variations in the VIS–AOD relationship, with stronger diurnal aerosol fluctuations in eastern China compared to the west, and a consistent inverse correlation between VIS and AOD. The correlation peaks in the late afternoon and reaches a seasonal maximum during winter. These relationships are influenced not only by regional meteorological thresholds but also by constraints from aerosol vertical distribution patterns and geographical conditions. Crucially, adjusting the AOD by incorporating the planetary boundary layer height markedly improves its correlation with VIS, underscoring the importance of daily planetary boundary layer dynamics. These findings offer valuable insights for refining hourly AOD retrieval methods from VIS, thereby enhancing the understanding of aerosol behavior across China."

 The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) suffers severe surface ozone (O3) pollution during summer (June-July-August, JJA). Elucidating the role of meteorology and emissions is crucial for effective controls on O3 pollution. We used the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) - Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system to quantify the influences of meteorology, anthropogenic and biogenic emissions on O3 variations in the YRD between 2019 and 2022. Contrasting trends in surface O3 were found in the Hangzhou Bay (HZB) (3.3 μg m−3 yr−1) and the rest of the YRD (−1.9 μg m−3 yr−1). Underlying factors affecting surface O3 differed between these two subregions. In HZB, meteorological variations dominated the strong O3 increase with a contribution of ∼94 %. By contrast, in the rest of the YRD, meteorology (42 %) and anthropogenic emissions (53 %) were both key contributors to the modest O3 decrease. Our results reveal a shift in O3 drivers in contrast to 2013–2019, characterized by an increasing importance of meteorology and a decreasing contribution of anthropogenic emissions. Consequently, the anthropogenically driven O3 decrease, which ensues from current pollutant control policies, is difficult to offset the strong positive meteorological influence such as in HZB. There is an urgent need for stricter and more efficient control of O3 precursor emissions to mitigate the substantial influences of meteorology. Emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds are of particular concern, as they are still on the rise."

 Understanding the chemical complexity of atmospheric aerosols and their associated health risks remains a significant challenge, particularly in rapidly urban regions. Although PM2.5-associated organic compounds have received growing attention, nitrogen-containing hazardous species such as nitrosamines remain under-explored.

Aerosol samples were collected in Tianjin (a mega city in China) in 2022, including the Beijing Winter Olympics period. The study revealed seasonal variations in hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), with elevated levels of carcinogenic nitrosamines observed in winter, particularly during the Olympics. And interestingly, the estimated carcinogenic risk of nitrosamines is quite consistent with the local incidence rate in Tianjin.

10.1016/j.atmosenv.2025.121328,True,Atmospheric Environment,该研究论文主要探讨了北京冬奥会期间空气污染控制措施对PM2.5浓度的影响。它使用了一种基于人工智能的贝叶斯结构时间序列模型，结合气象数据和历史PM2.5浓度记录，来预测如果没有采取干预措施的情况下，冬奥会期间的PM2.5浓度。研究结果表明，所采取的措施显著降低了PM2.5浓度。虽然该研究没有直接涉及遥感技术或卫星观测，但它与大气环境监测和空气质量评估密切相关，通过量化污染控制措施的效果，为未来的空气质量管理提供了依据。,"['PM2.5', 'Air Quality Monitoring', 'Causal Inference', 'Pollution Control', 'Bayesian Structural Time Series', 'Counterfactual Prediction', 'LSTM', 'RNNs', 'Meteorological Data']",Weizhao Liang;Yuan Li;Xuan Liu;Qili Dai;Yinchang Feng,AI-based Bayesian structural time series modeling for assessing PM<sub>2.5</sub> air quality improvements during the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics,"•A new RNNs-Bayesian model was proposed for causal inference in pollution control. •LSTM model outperforms Prophet and RF in counterfactual air quality prediction. •Beijing's PM2.5fell 34 % during the 2022 Winter Olympics, down 20 μg/m3. 
 To prevent poor air quality during the Beijing Winter Olympics (BWO), substantial air pollution control measures were implemented in Beijing and surrounding cities. However, the actual causal effects of these measures remain uncertain, primarily due to the difficulty of establishing an appropriate control group under complex meteorological conditions and high anthropogenic emissions in cold season. This study addresses that challenge by employing an artificial intelligence (AI)-based Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) model to estimate the causal effects of intervention measures. Utilizing temporal-related proxies, meteorological data, and PM2.5 concentration records from 2015 to 2021, counterfactual PM2.5 concentrations were first predicted using a Random Forest-Long Short-Term Memory (RF-LSTM) hybrid model, which generated a covariate for the BSTS model to enable robust causal inference with minimal parametric assumptions. The results indicate that, in the absence of interventions, Beijing's PM2.5 during the Winter Olympics would have been 20 μg/m3 (34 %) higher. The implemented measures significantly reduced peak PM2.5 levels during the Winter Olympics and Winter Paralympics. Rigorous validation confirmed the accuracy of the predicted counterfactual PM2.5 concentration, thereby strengthening the reliability of the causal inference results. Overall, the AI-based BSTS approach effectively quantified the PM2.5 reductions attributable to the air quality assurance measures during the BWO, providing strong evidence for the effectiveness of pollution control efforts."
10.1016/j.atmosenv.2025.121340,False,Atmospheric Environment,该研究论文主要关注多环芳烃（PAHs）的全球分布及其对健康的影响，特别是苯并[a]芘（BaP）。它使用IAP-AACM模型和非线性降尺度方法，基于人为排放和观测数据，模拟了PAHs的全球高分辨率分布。研究重点在于评估不同分辨率下（0.1° × 0.1°和1° × 1°）的BaP暴露水平对人群健康风险的影响，并分析了季节和年龄对健康风险的影响差异。虽然涉及空气质量，但侧重于模型模拟和健康风险评估，与大气环境遥感技术（如卫星观测或大气成分分析）的直接关联性较弱。,"['PAHs', 'Benzo[a]pyrene', 'Air quality modeling', 'Health risk assessment', 'Emission downscaling']",Zichen Wu;Xueshun Chen;Yuanlin Wang;Wenyi Yang;Yang Wang;Zhe Wang;Huansheng Chen;Lianfang Wei;Wending Wang;Huiyun Du;Zhuoran Wang;Ying Wei;Xiao Tang;Jie Li;Lin Wu;Zifa Wang,Global health impacts of PAHs based on high-resolution modeling by dynamic simulation and relative emission downscaling,"•The 0.1° × 0.1° simulation by downscaling improves the global BaP accuracy. •Health risk due to BaP at 0.1° × 0.1° resolution has increased by over 50 %. •Health risk due to BaP is significantly higher in winter than in other seasons. •Health risk due to BaP is larger for children and young adults than for other groups. 
 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are one of the highly toxic pollutants that require strict control. High-resolution distribution of PAHs is crucial for accurately quantifying their population exposure levels. However, due to the high computational cost, few models applying the dynamical approach could simulate global PAHs to evaluate health effects with resolution down to 1–10 km. This study simulated the global distribution of PAHs by combining the IAP-AACM model with a nonlinear downscaling method based on relative anthropogenic emissions and observations. A global high-resolution (0.1° × 0.1°, ∼10 km in middle latitudes) dataset of Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP, the most representative PAHs) in 2013 and 2018 is generated to support exposure studies. The 0.1° × 0.1° results are comparable to the nested simulation and have better consistency with observations than that of the 1° × 1° simulation. The 0.1° × 0.1° estimation shows significantly higher population-weighted total incremental lifetime cancer risks (PTILCR), with an increase larger than 50 %, compared to the 1° × 1° simulation. The PTILCR is greatly higher in winter than in other seasons and it is larger for children and young adults than for adolescents and seniors. The study has significant implications for the reliable assessment of global health risks of PAHs and the development of scientific management strategies for different age groups."

 East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM), a system comprised of several atmospheric members, profoundly impacts local and global climate. However, whether the EAWM is always a firmly unified system is unclear. This study examines the connection between two key EAWM system members: the East Asian trough (EAT) and Siberian High (SH). Our findings reveal that the connection between the two circulations is most unstable in January out of the three winter months over the past six decades. Notably, the January EAT-SH connection has experienced a significant decadal weakening since the early 1990s. By diagnosing the related baroclinic and barotropic processes, we demonstrate that although baroclinic process is important in establishing the EAT-SH connection, its contribution is weaker than that of barotropic process. When the EAT and SH are associated with different barotropic processes, their connection is undermined. Over the whole period, the barotropic processes related to the EAT and SH are featured by a triple atmospheric pattern over the North Atlantic-Eastern Europe. This pattern maintains a stable and significant relationship with the SH, but its association with the EAT is substantially weakened since the early 1990s. Further analysis suggests that this decadal weakened relationship possibly attributed to the decadal weakened westerly jet stream over the Eurasian continent. Alongside this weakened jet stream, the Rossby wave train triggered by the triple atmospheric pattern more readily propagates upward into the stratosphere, but exhibits weak horizontal propagation over Siberia. Consequently, the impact of the triple atmospheric pattern on the EAT diminishes after the early 1990s, contributing to the weakened EAT-SH connection."
