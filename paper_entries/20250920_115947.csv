10.1088/1748-9326/adf97f,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究主要关注中国主要流域极端降水事件的季节性变化，包括发生时间、强度和分布。研究分析了1960年至2018年间中国2200个气象站的降水数据，探讨了不同流域极端降水事件的季节性特征及其长期变化趋势。研究结果表明，中国南北方流域在极端降水事件的季节性方面存在明显差异，且受到ENSO等气候因素的影响。虽然该研究涉及大气中的水汽含量，但其重点在于降水事件的统计分析和气候影响，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关联。,[],Yuna Mao;Jiayi Lu;Yan Zhang;Guocan Wu;Bin He;Kaicun Wang,Changing seasonality and advanced mean date of annual maximum daily precipitation in major river basins of China (1960–2018),"Extreme rainfall seasonality plays a critical role in vegetation growth, agricultural production, and water resource management. Under global warming, increasing attention has been paid to its seasonal shifts and nonstationarity characteristics. In our comprehensive research, we utilized daily precipitation data from approximately 2200 gauge stations across China to investigate the spatial patterns, interannual variability, and long-term changes in the seasonality characteristics of annual maximum daily precipitation from 1960 to 2018. In the northern river basins, such as Hai, Songliao, Yellow, and Northwest River Basins, extreme daily events exhibit lower magnitude but stronger seasonality, accompanied by later timing and less variability in the mean date. Conversely, the southern river basins, such as Yangtze, Pearl, and Southeast River Basins, display the opposite pattern. Trend analysis shows that the mean occurrence date of extreme precipitation has generally advanced across most basins. Changes in the seasonality index reveal a clear north–south contrast: in the northern basins, seasonality has weakened, implying that extreme precipitation events become more dispersed throughout the year. In the southern basins, seasonality has strengthened, with extreme precipitation becoming more concentrated. The seasonal pattern of total column water vapor partly explains the earlier timing of extremes, especially in northern and central regions. Notably, El Niño-Southern Oscillation exerts a discernible influence on the seasonality of extreme precipitation. El Niño induces delayed extremes in the Huai and lower Yangtze River Basin, but earlier events in the Northwest and Pearl River Basin. Notable reduced SI during El Niño versus La Niña phases, indicating La Niña intensifies precipitation seasonality. This study plays a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of extreme precipitation events, ultimately promoting resilience and reducing vulnerabilities to weather-related disasters."

Identifying opportunities to enhance crop diversity in the United States,"The benefits of crop diversification for key agro-environmental outcomes are well-established, yet the pathways to realizing this diversification at larger scales remain murky. We propose a framework to evaluate possible spatial and temporal crop arrangements that meet specific crop diversity targets by drawing on empirical data across millions of individual crop fields and their recent cropping histories in the US (2015–2022). Specifically, we develop a simple rule-based model to raise crop species diversity to various levels of spatial and temporal crop diversity (driven by crop rotations) already attained by farmers in areas with broadly similar soils and climate (‘attainable diversity’). We demonstrate that small changes on the local scale have sizeable cumulative effects. For example, switching crops in 3.4% of fields (corresponding to 12.4% of US cropland area) in the 75th percentile attainable diversity scenario would raise national-scale crop diversity by over 50% (effective number of crop species increased from 7.6 to 11.5). These simulated changes in crop diversity have clear spatial patterns associated with cropland extent and field size. Finally, we examine how the geographic redistribution of key commodity crops (maize, soybean, and wheat) resulting from these crop switches would influence crop yield and production outcomes. While geographic redistribution has limited influence on yields of these three crops, including some potential yield gains, net national production declines (by ∼10%–13% in our main spatial diversification scenario) due to their reduced share in the cropland portfolio as minor crop groups expand. By drawing on a pool of crops that are already grown in areas with similar field sizes, climate, and soils, our results can help inform realistic strategies toward national-scale crop diversification—illustrating potential ‘low-hanging fruit’ for crop transitions across different landscapes. Our proposed empirical attainable diversity framework adds nuance around the opportunities and barriers associated with efforts to raise agrobiodiversity."

Here, we use a novel SSP2-com scenario that integrates updated emissions trajectories, China’s carbon neutrality pledge, and mid-to-late 21st century carbon dioxide removal (CDR) deployment to assess Earth system responses under a 2 °C-aligned pathway. Employing a state-of-the-art Earth system model, we demonstrate that SSP2-com limits end-of-century warming to 1.87 °C (below 2 °C), 0.51 °C and 1.47 °C lower than SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0, respectively. Despite a reduction in global carbon sinks, SSP2-com’s stringent mitigation avoids 0.08 °C and 0.29 °C of warming relative to SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0, respectively, attributed to China’s accelerated decarbonization. Our findings suggest that combining ambitious regional action (e.g. China’s 2060 net-zero goal) with global CDR deployment provides a critical pathway to stabilize below 2 °C, yet underscores unresolved risks from uneven cooling efficacy and ecosystem feedbacks. This work advances scenario design by reconciling national climate pledges with global targets, offering actionable insights for policymakers to prioritize equity-driven mitigation."

While these stressors will globally lead to the compression of marine habitats, their regional effects vary significantly and remain understudied. This is particularly true for the southeastern Pacific (SEP), which supports rich pelagic and benthic ecosystems closely linked to a complex seafloor featuring archipelagos and extensive seamount chains. Using model simulations from Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, this study examines future regional-scale environmental changes in the SEP. Our analysis builds on the observation that the South Pacific Ocean Gyre is among the regions experiencing the least warming globally and that the epipelagic zone within the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) may oxygenate in the future. These conditions may promote habitat expansion, which we assess using the climate velocities for temperature, oxygen, and pH. Estimates of climate velocities from the ensemble model mean under a pessimistic near future (2015-2050) yield values ranging from –730 to 449 km/year, exhibiting greater absolute climate velocities for oxygen than pH. Over the longer-term horizon (2015–2100), the area of zones where absolute climate velocity exceeded the 75th percentile increased by 65%, 72%, and 215% for temperature, oxygen, and pH, respectively. The strongest velocities (absolute value) occur in the equatorial sector and in the Humboldt system. While all regions mostly show a climate-driven habitat loss due to surface-to-200 m pH decline, two broad areas benefit from conservation below the surface: a region in the tropics extending from 10°S–100°W to the east of Rapa Nui and the coastal region of Peru and Chile, extending up to the Desventuradas and Juan Fernández archipelagos. While the former is due to the slow warming rates (<2.9 km yr−1), the latter results from both slow deoxygenation and oxygenation climate velocities (between −2.9 and 2.9 km yr−1) along the coast of those countries, a zone that overlaps with the lowest changes in pH in the SEP, giving them a unique conservation value. We demonstrate that epipelagic ecosystems within the OMZ may be less impacted by CC than those outside of it. These findings highlight key areas for conservation under future ocean warming, deoxygenation and pH changes."

This study conducts a structured literature review, following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses framework, to identify and analyse governance challenges associated with mCDR within the broader context of multilateral ocean governance. Using the socio–ecological–technological systems (SETSs) framework, challenges were systematically coded to capture interdependencies across social, ecological, and technological (S/E/T) domains. The analysis of 35 peer-reviewed publications identified 100 distinct governance challenges, revealing that most cannot be categorised within single-system domains. Instead, challenges frequently span intersections between S/E/T systems, highlighting issues such as fragmented governance structures, ecological risks from technological interventions, and legitimacy concerns linked to deployment. These findings underscore the systemic nature of mCDR governance challenges and the limitations of siloed governance approaches. The study demonstrates that applying a SETS perspective enables the identification of cross-domain trade-offs, synergies, and coordination gaps, supporting the development of system-aware governance frameworks for mCDR."

Outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) is a critical component of the Earth’s energy budget, and the balance between absorbed solar radiation and OLR determines the net gain of energy of the entire climate system. Radiation computations using 43 years of ERA5 reanalysis profiles show an increase in clear-sky OLR in the polar regions and a decrease in the tropics. To understand this contrast, we analyze zonal- and annual-mean clear-sky OLR changes in the Northern Hemisphere from 1979 to 2021. We identify a transition in temporal clear-sky OLR changes from low to high latitudes, with a “crossover” point where the sign changes around 30°N. We improve upon previous studies by employing infrared spectrally-detailed line-by-line radiative transfer calculations, to decompose zonal-mean trends caused by forcing and feedback mechanisms. Our diagnostic investigation shows that the increase in water vapor exerts a dominant negative contribution to the OLR temporal change in the tropics due to a larger OLR sensitivity to water vapor increase there, while the increase in surface temperature (Ts) dominates the positive temporal change in the Arctic, both due to Arctic amplification and a larger OLR sensitivity to Ts increase. Greater greenhouse gases’ forcings and smaller OLR sensitivity to Ts change in the tropics, as well as an imperfect cancellation between atmospheric temperature and water vapor contribution, delineates the crossover point at around 30°N."

Atmospheric aerosol-induced changes in surface solar radiation and air temperature have profoundly influenced solar energy in China in recent decades. However, the solar PV power generation losses caused by aerosol pollution in China remain unclear. Here, we combined multi-model ensemble simulations from multiple Earth system models with different anthropogenic emission scenarios and the latest information from 14 072 solar plants in China to evaluate the impact of aerosol pollution on solar energy. Our results show that aerosol pollution mitigation can improve solar PV generation in China. Compared with preindustrial anthropogenic emission levels, aerosol pollution may reduce annual mean solar PV power generation by up to 48.13 TWh across the 14 072 solar plants in China. Notably, even low pollution levels can cause substantial generation losses in northwestern China because of their extensive installed capacity. Moreover, negative effects of aerosol pollution on solar energy will exist in the future. Our study highlights the importance of aerosol pollution mitigation for enhanced renewable energy in China."

Our knowledge of these dynamics remains limited in the temperate mountains of Eastern Europe, which have experienced significant land-use shifts, especially following the collapse of the communist regime. It is noteworthy that the contribution of shrubs has not been evaluated, partly due to the difficulty of providing high-resolution mapping of shrublands. In this study, we integrated four decades of Landsat-derived NDVI time series with a customized land cover classification based on Sentinel-2 imagery to investigate greenness dynamics above 1500 m elevation in the Carpathian Mountains. The classification targeted key shrubland types using spectral indices tailored to seasonal pigment variations. We also conducted diachronic visual analysis of aerial photographs, including Cold War-era satellite images, to evaluate long-term vegetation changes. We found significant positive greenness trends in 44% of the study area, with the highest magnitude located at mid-elevations (1800–2300 m) and on north-facing slopes. High-resolution land cover mapping revealed that Ericaceous and Juniperus-dominated shrublands were the strongest contributors to greening. Visual interpretation of historical imagery confirmed widespread woody encroachment in these areas. We suggest that the decline of traditional land-use, particularly extensive grazing practices, is a key driver of these ecological shifts, promoting the resurgence of previously more widespread subalpine shrublands. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating high-resolution remote sensing observations and diachronic analysis of aerial photographs to disentangle the complexity of vegetation greening in high-elevation ecosystems."

Brennan;Lena Wilhelm,Saharan dust linked to European hail events,"In this study, we discovered that natural dust carried into Europe significantly increases the likelihood of hailstorms. By analyzing dust data, weather records, and hail reports, we found that moderate dust levels lead to more frequent hail, while very high or low dust amounts reduce it. Adding dust information into statistical models improved forecasting skills. 
 Saharan dust significantly influences hail occurrence in Europe. Using Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) and reanalysis data, crowd-sourced hail reports, lightning data, and radar measurements, we find a strong correlation between elevated dust loading and hail events. Hail coverage exceeding 28 % of 1° × 1° grid cells only occurs when dust loading surpasses 2.4 mg m−2, while on hail days the median dust load is 1.82 times higher than on non-hail days (7σ difference). This effect is particularly strong along the Alpine crest, central France, eastern Germany, Austria, and Eastern Europe, where median dust loads more than double on hail days.By grouping data according to synoptic weather patterns, we confirm that hail days consistently exhibit higher dust concentrations regardless of prevailing synoptic conditions, supporting the robust link between dust and hail. Peak hail activity occurs at 38 mg m−2 or a dust optical depth of 0.033, suggesting enhanced cloud and ice nucleation. Above this range, hail frequency declines, likely due to microphysical or radiative constraints.Crowd-sourced reports show significantly more hail events on high-dust days, with up to 10 times more reports for hail >20 mm. Statistical hail models, including a logistic regression model (LRM) and a generalized additive model (GAM), rank dust as one of the top three predictors. Its inclusion increases the critical success index (CSI) by 5 % (LRM) and 12 % (GAM), and boosts explained variance in the GAM by 6 %. These findings identify Saharan dust as a key modulator of European hail activity, exerting both enhancing and inhibiting effects depending on dust concentration and the definition of hail events."

We derive the data from a machine-learning-based 3D extrapolation of high-resolution 2D satellite data and an object-based detection algorithm. Cloud properties are not only affected by the surface type. Instead, our findings highlight the impact of convective cores on horizontal and vertical cloud and core properties and a potential prolonging of the cloud life cycle. 
 In this two-part study, we examine spatio-temporal patterns of convective clouds, their properties, and organisation. We use a machine-learning-based method to extrapolate a contiguous 3D cloud field of 2D satellite data. The predicted data are used to simultaneously track both the horizontal and vertical development of clouds. Our research focuses on West Africa, a region known for frequent convective events and severe weather. In Part 1, this study compares cloud and core properties and the cloud life cycle over land and ocean during a 6-month period from March to August 2019. Our analysis reveals that 65 % of tracked cloud systems contain only a single core and persist for less than 3 h. Despite their shorter lifespan compared to multi-core clusters, single-core clouds exhibit stronger changes in the radar reflectivity and a higher vertical growth. In contrast, multi-core clouds show greater horizontal growth, encompassing larger cloud and core areas, higher cloud-top heights (CTHs), and higher average reflectivity at 10 km altitude. We also find that, in systems with more cores, both the maximum number of cores and the peak core area occur later during the cloud life cycle. Notably, the differences in cloud characteristics between land and ocean are smaller than those associated with the number of convective cores. However, the results may not fully capture climatological differences. Further research using longer time series is needed to quantify the observed variability of tropical convection."

This study investigates spatio-temporal patterns of convective organisation and their relationship to machine-learning-based 3D cloud properties through a combination of different indices. We analyse how organisation affects cloud and core properties in a tropical domain, revealing overlapping effects of strong and weak organisation that may frequently blur statistics. 
 This series of papers explores spatio-temporal patterns of convective cloud occurrence and organisation. We use a machine-learning-based method to extrapolate a contiguous 3D cloud field of 2D satellite data. In Part 2, we focus on convective organisation in tropical West Africa between March and August 2019, examining how it relates to the 3D properties of convective clouds and their core structures. We quantify organisation using three indices (SCAI, COP, ROME) to capture different aspects of spatial cloud clustering. Our findings highlight how cloud properties may interact with organisation. Hence, strong organisation may occur with larger cloud areas, lower cloud tops and core heights, and shorter lifespans compared to the average convective system. In contrast, weak organisation may be associated with smaller clouds and fewer cores but similarly shorter lifespans. We find an increasing frequency of convective organisation in the Northern Hemisphere during boreal summer months, likely linked to the northward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). From March to May, patches of strong convective organisation emerge along the African coastlines and over the southern Atlantic Ocean. Between June and August, hotspots shift inland, particularly across the Sahel and wider West African Plains. Notably, oceanic regions show slightly stronger organisation overall. However, overlapping regions of strong and weak organisation may complicate the interpretation of regional statistics. While the machine-learning-based 3D perspective helps bridge observational gaps in the representation of cloud structures, the inherent complexity and variability of convective organisation highlight the need for continued investigation."

We measured SOA yields of seven alkanes and their oxygenated derivatives in oxidation flow reactor (OFR) measurements to assess their role in SOA formation. In addition, we observed that cyclic structure enhances SOA production. Furthermore, our observations indicate that multi-generational hydroxyl radical (OH) oxidation is important in the SOA formation. 
 Alkanes are hydrocarbons that are emitted into the atmosphere mainly by human activities such as combustion processes and via the use of volatile chemical products (VCPs). They are an important group of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can produce secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in the atmosphere via hydroxyl (OH) radical initiated reactions. For many other compound groups (e.g., aromatics and monoterpenes), highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) formed via autoxidation have been shown to be an important link between VOCs and SOA. Although alkane SOA has been intensively studied over the last decades, the importance of autoxidation and HOM in this system has received limited attention. The first HOM observations were only recently reported, but their relation so SOA has not been directly studied. Here, we show results of SOA yields from seven C10 alkanes and their oxygenated derivatives in oxidation flow reactor experiments. We observe the well-known behaviour of increased SOA yield with different structure in the order of cyclic > linear > branched. We also measured HOMs, and all seven SOA precursors produced detectable amounts of products, but HOM quantification was not possible due to the experimental setup configuration focusing on SOA formation. However, a comparison to previously reported HOM yields for the same precursors was conducted, indicating a correlation between HOM and SOA yields. Although not quantifiable, our own HOM observations did indicate that multi-generation OH oxidation played an important role in the SOA formation in our study."

Caravan is a community initiative which aims to combine large-sample hydrology datasets of meteorological forcing data, catchment attributes and discharge data for catchments around the world.  The GRDC-Caravan extension is based on a subset of hydrological discharge data and station-based watersheds from the Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC), which are covered by an open data policy. The GRDC is an international data centre operating under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), which collects quality-controlled river discharge data and associated metadata from the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHS) of WMO member states. The extension contains discharge data and catchment boundaries from GRDC, which can be released under a permissive license (CC-BY-4.0). In addition, the extension contains meteorological forcing data and catchment attributes from the global datasets ERA5-Land and HydroATLAS in a standardized format. The dataset covers stations from 5356 catchments and 25 countries and spans the years 1950–2023. Compared to the core version of Caravan, the extension takes the total number of Caravan catchments to be 22 372 (of which 1589 catchments are duplicates between the core and extensions). While in the core Caravan dataset mostly stations from North America, central Europe  and South America were included, the new extension significantly improves the global coverage of the dataset with new stations across Europe, South America, South Africa, Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand. In addition, the temporal extension of the time series could be significantly increased from 40–70 years. The extension strongly improves the global and temporal coverage of Caravan and represents a valuable dataset for global hydrological and climatological modelling studies. The dataset is released under a CC-BY-4.0 license that allows for redistribution and is publicly available on Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15349031 (Färber et al., 2025)."

Validated against multiple in situ networks and analysis datasets, it demonstrated superior accuracy. This dataset is vital for understanding soil moisture dynamics, especially during droughts, and highlights the need to mitigate soil-type-dependent biases in the model. 
 An improved fine-scale soil moisture (SM) dataset at 1 km grid spacing, covering much of the eastern continental US, was generated by assimilating 9 km Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) SM data into the v4.0.1 Noah-MP land surface model. With 12 ensemble members, the assimilation was carried out using the ensemble Kalman filter algorithm within NASA's Land Information System. The SM analysis for 2016 was fully validated against in situ observations from four different networks and compared with four other existing datasets. Results indicate that this SM analysis surpasses other datasets in top-layer SM distribution, including a machine-learning-based product, despite all SM estimates being less heterogeneous than observed. The analysis of anomalous errors suggests that large similarity in intrinsic errors is likely due to overlapping data sources among the selected SM datasets. More detailed evaluations were performed over two geographic areas. The observations collected by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement facility in Oklahoma suggest that soil temperature and surface heat fluxes are concurrently simulated with good accuracy. Investigation into the 2016 southeastern US drought response further indicates drier conditions and higher evapotranspiration estimates compared to GLEAMv4.1. Notably, large errors are associated with grids having clay soil textures, underscoring the need for refined model treatments for specific soil types to further improve SM estimates. The dataset is publicly available on Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14370563 (Tai et al., 2024)."
10.5194/gmd-18-6167-2025,True,Geoscientific Model Development,该研究论文主要关注于提高GNSS（全球导航卫星系统）定位中对流层延迟校正的精度。它提出了一种新的垂直修正模型，用于更准确地将VMF1/VMF3对流层产品中的天顶静力延迟（ZHD）和天顶湿延迟（ZWD）插值到GNSS站点的目标高度。该方法利用ERA5再分析数据和无线电探空仪数据进行建模和评估，结果表明，与传统方法相比，新模型显著提高了ZHD、ZWD以及天顶对流层延迟（ZTD）的精度，尤其是在GNSS站点与最近的VMF网格点高度差异较大的情况下。这项研究对于需要使用对流层延迟校正的应用（如GNSS定位和GNSS气象学）具有重要意义，因为它可以提高定位和气象监测的准确性。虽然该研究主要关注定位精度，但对流层延迟的精确估计也对利用GNSS信号进行大气环境参数的反演（例如水汽含量）有帮助，因此与大气环境遥感技术，特别是卫星观测和大气成分分析有一定关联。,"['tropospheric delay', 'GNSS meteorology', 'satellite positioning', 'zenith tropospheric delay', 'VMF1/VMF3', 'ERA5 reanalysis data', 'radiosonde profiles']",Peng Sun;Kefei Zhang;Dantong Zhu;Shuangshuang Shi;Xuexi Liu;Dongsheng Zhao;Minghao Zhang;Suqin Wu,A new vertical reduction model for enhancing the interpolation accuracy of VMF1/VMF3 tropospheric delay products,"A new method has been developed to more accurately adjust atmospheric delay data for use in satellite positioning, especially in areas with large height differences. By using long-term weather data and testing with global observation stations, the new method significantly improves accuracy compared to traditional approaches. This can benefit applications such as precise positioning and weather monitoring using navigation satellite signals. 
 Grid-wise Vienna Mapping Functions 1 (VMF1) and Vienna Mapping Functions 3 (VMF3) tropospheric products are widely used to interpolate the a priori zenith hydrostatic delay (ZHD) and zenith wet delay (ZWD) over GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) stations for the mitigation of tropospheric delays contained in GNSS observations. Since these two products provide ZHD and ZWD values only for the ground surface at global grid points, the ZHD and ZWD at the four grid points nearest to a GNSS site used to interpolate for the GNSS site need to be reduced to the same height of the GNSS station before a horizontal interpolation (e.g., bilinear interpolation) is implemented. However, the accuracy of the officially recommended reduction model may not be as good as desired, especially in the case that the height of the GNSS site largely differs from that of the four ground grid points. To address this, a new vertical reduction model for reducing the ZHD and ZWD at the height of grid points to a target height was developed. The sample data for the modelling were the 10-year (2010–2019) ZHD and ZWD profiles over grid points obtained from ERA5 monthly averaged reanalysis data, while the 3-year (2020–2022) radiosonde profiles and the IGS (International GNSS Service) site-wise zenith tropospheric delay (ZTD) products were used to evaluate the new model. Results demonstrated that the accuracy of ZHD, ZWD, and consequently ZTD values interpolated from VMF1/VMF3 products and the new model considerably improved compared to traditional methods, especially at the target sites that have large height differences from its closest VMF grid points. This improvement has significance for those applications that need to use tropospheric delay corrections, e.g. in GNSS positioning and GNSS meteorology for a desired accuracy."

Overall, the results suggest that the diagenesis model is better suited for detailed process-based dynamics over extended timeframes, whereas simpler models such as the Hybrid model (combining the zero- and first-order models), are more appropriate for short- to medium-term applications or situations with limited data availability. 
 This research evaluates the performance of the CE-QUAL-W2 v4.5 sediment diagenesis model in simulating water temperature, dissolved oxygen, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, chlorophyll a, and biochemical oxygen demand in a Portuguese reservoir over a six-year period (2016–2021). The model was calibrated using 35 observed profiles of temperature and dissolved oxygen, as well as six annual measurements of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll a, and biochemical oxygen demand at multiple depths. To benchmark performance to the sediment diagenesis model, three alternative sediment oxygen demand formulations – a Zero-order, First-order, and a Hybrid model combining both approaches – were also implemented and compared. All models achieved NSE and RMSE values within or near the ranges reported in the literature, effectively capturing the system's water quality dynamics. Among them, the Hybrid model yielded the best overall performance while maintaining a simpler structure (Water temperature – NSE: 0.96±0.18; RMSE: 1.09±0.23 °C; Dissolved oxygen – NSE: 0.76±0.30; RMSE: 1.87±0.72 mg L−1). The sediment diagenesis model exhibited similar performance metrics (Water temperature – NSE: 0.95±0.18; RMSE: 1.13±0.28 °C; Dissolved oxygen – NSE: 0.71±0.14; RMSE: 2.01±0.59 mg L−1). Overall, the results suggest that the diagenesis model may be better suited for capturing detailed process-based dynamics over extended timeframes, whereas simpler models, such as the Hybrid model, are more appropriate for short- to medium-term applications or situations with limited data availability. Hopefully, the results of this study will help improve water management strategies by supporting more informed model selection tailored to the temporal scope and data constraints of reservoir monitoring programs."

 Circulating metabolites are crucial to biological processes underlying health and diseases, yet their genetic determinants remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigate the genetic architecture of nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomics, analyzing 249 metabolic measures and 64 biologically plausible ratios in 254,825 participants. We conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) identifying 24,438 independent variant-metabolite associations across 427 loci, with effect sizes highly concordant with 19 previous studies. Fine-mapping pinpoints 3610 putative causal associations, 785 of which are novel. Additionally, we utilize whole exome sequencing data and uncover 2948 gene-metabolite associations through aggregate testing, underscoring the importance of rare coding variants overlooked in GWAS. Integrating our findings with disease genetics reveals potential causal associations, such as between acetate levels and the risk of atrial fibrillation and flutter. Collectively, this study delineates the complex genetic architecture of the plasma metabolome, offering a valuable resource for future investigations into disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies.

We combine in vivo recordings in male rats with synaptic input reconstructions, multi-scale modelling and optogenetic manipulations. We find that thalamocortical (TC) synapses, which provide sensory input to cortex, target specifically and most densely the dendritic domain that initiates calcium APs in PTs. Sensory input from thalamus is hence a reliable, but weak source for activating the dendritic calcium domain. Because it is fast and local, this activation enables active dendritic coupling of sensory input with multiple sensory-evoked and ongoing input streams that arrive during and surprisingly before the stimulus. This ‘TC coupling’ mechanism accounts for the modulation of the first sensory responses that leave the cortex with bursts of APs. How the brain combines sensory with non-sensory information is unknown. Here, the authors find that sensory input from the thalamus to the apical dendrites of the main cortical output neurons enables the first stage of this combination process."

Here, authors combine a genetic strategy with a novel optochemical tool to show that spindle pole-localized F-actin is essential for proper meiotic spindle assembly and chromosome segregation. 
 Mammalian oocytes are notoriously prone to chromosome segregation errors leading to aneuploidy. The spindle provides the machinery for accurate chromosome segregation during cell division. Mammalian oocytes lack centrioles and, therefore, mouse meiotic spindle relies on the organization of numerous acentriolar microtubule organizing centers into two poles (polar microtubule organizing centers, pMTOCs). The traditional view is that, in mammalian oocytes, microtubules are the sole cytoskeletal component responsible for regulating pMTOC organization and spindle assembly. We identify a previously unrecognized F-actin pool that surrounds pMTOCs, forming F-actin cage-like structure. We demonstrate that F-actin localization on the spindle depends on unconventional myosins X and VIIb. Selective disruption of spindle-localized F-actin, using myosin X/VIIb knockdown oocytes or photoswitchable Optojasp-1, perturbs pMTOC organization, leading to unfocused spindle poles and chromosome missegregation. Here, we unveil an important function of spindle-localized F-actin in regulating pMTOC organization, a critical process for ensuring the fidelity of meiotic spindle formation and proper chromosome segregation.

They combine biophysical, biochemical, and computational methods to uncover its role in the activation of G protein and arrestin pathways. 
 Previous efforts in delineating molecular mechanisms of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation have focused on transmembrane regions and ligand-receptor contacts of the extracellular loops. The role of the highly flexible N-termini of rhodopsin-like GPCRs have not been well characterized to date. We hypothesize that transient contacts between the peptide ligand and the intrinsically disordered N-terminus (NT) of the neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptor Y2 (Y2R) will affect receptor signaling. We employ cross-linking mass spectrometry to capture ligand-receptor contacts including transient binding modes. A photo-reactive NPY analogue allows mapping the interaction between NPY and Y2R NT resulting in a total number of 40 cross-links. The cross-links provide distance constraints for deriving structural models of the interaction. Molecular dynamics simulations highlight the structural flexibility and rapid interconversion of ligand-receptor contacts. Mutagenesis of Y2R and functional characterization suggest that the cross-linking hotspots in the NT electrostatically control its conformational ensemble. The NT engages in transient contacts to the peptide and prolongs ligand residence time, which is required for efficient interaction of Y2R with arrestin-3, but not Gi. We delineate structure-function relationships for the intrinsically disordered Y2R NT and propose a functional role for transient binding modes involving the NT of a peptide-binding receptor.

 Understanding the solvation structures of OH− and H3O+ at metal interfaces is crucial for developing efficient electrochemical devices. In this paper, we present a detailed investigation of the solvation structures of OH− and H3O+ near gold electrodes under alkaline and acidic aqueous conditions, using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at controlled surface charge density conditions. Our findings reveal that the adsorption tendencies of OH− and H3O+ are strongly influenced by the oscillating net atomic charge of water normal to the electrified interface in concert with the distinct solvation patterns of these charge defects. While OH− preferentially adsorbs onto the gold surface within the first water layer, the positive net atomic charge restricts the closest approach of H3O+ to beyond the first water layer.

 Community-based conservation has gained traction in the Brazilian Amazon because of its potential in combining territorial protection, local well-being and biodiversity conservation. We assessed the footprint of effective protection, areas actively monitored and defended through community-led surveillance, where illegal activities such as poaching, fishing and logging are successfully prevented, within the largest community-based fisheries conservation arrangement in the Amazon. While the arrangement focused specifically on 13 lakes which were on average 47 ha in size, the effectively protected floodplain area was approximately eightfold larger than the extent of direct protection, defined as the immediate focal area sustaining financial returns through co-management. The additional protection of this ‘functional area’ was on average 11,188 ha, or 36-fold larger than the directly protected area. Although the average cost of effective protection was low (US$0.95 ha−1 yr−1), this was entirely incurred by low-income local communities. Our study underscores the remarkable effort leveraged by Amazonian rural communities in protecting natural ecosystems and the imperative need to develop compensation mechanisms to financially reward them, which are currently lacking.

 Aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs) are promising for sustainable energy storage due to their safety and affordability. Conventional ‘lean-water’ electrolytes improve cell cyclability and the electrochemical stability window by stabilizing the interface; however, ionic transport in the bulk is limited and the use of high-concentration salt jeopardizes their practical adaptability. Here we report a dual-salt electrolyte involving ZnSO4 and Zn(ClO4)2 that decouples the interfacial chemistry from the bulk. Specifically, SO42− ions populate the Zn/electrolyte interface, whereas ClO4− anions dominate in the bulk. Strongly hydrated SO42− stabilizes interfacial water, while weakly hydrated ClO4− disrupts bulk hydrogen-bond networks, suppressing electrolyte freezing and enabling fast Zn2+ transport. In the absence of high salt concentrations and organic solvents, our decoupled electrolyte achieves a high ionic conductivity of 15.1 mS cm⁻1 and Zn plating/stripping reversibility of 99.97% at −40 °C. Assembled Zn//NaV3O8 pouch cells under practical configurations show a daily self-discharge rate of 0.13%, retain 93% capacity after 900 cycles at 25 °C, and deliver full capacity retention over 3,000 cycles at −40 °C.

 Multiple cropping, the simultaneous cultivation of several crops in space or time, is a global practice essential for intensifying and diversifying agriculture. Despite its substantial impact on environmental and socioeconomic outcomes of farming, multiple cropping is hardly accounted for in assessments of global food production, sustainability, and climate impacts. Such studies, often relying on modelling of cropping systems, land use change, and eventually the Earth system, are of growing importance in decision-making and policymaking. However, they primarily assume monocropping, neglecting carryover effects between crops and their implications for land use. This limitation compromises the representativeness of these studies and the conclusions they draw, essentially overlooking a substantial option space for sustainable intensification, nature-based solutions, and resulting land-atmosphere feedback.

 Accurate topographic phase removal in Differential InSAR (DInSAR) processing relies on Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), yet limitations in DEM accuracy and currency hinder precise surface displacement measurement. Although modern SAR satellites feature a relatively narrow orbit tube, the phases induced by DEM errors cannot be safely ignored especially in areas under rapid urbanization. Current Multi-Temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) methods, which estimate DEM errors alongside deformation, suffer from potential biases due to inaccurate deformation models and high computational cost from per-point processing. We present here a novel detection-and-estimation strategy for efficient DEM error mitigation. Our key innovation is a phase gradient direction consistency (GDC) criterion, which provides a direct and intuitive visualization of pixels affected by DEM errors (PEEs)—a capability not previously available. This is a significant advancement as it allows targeted correction instead of exhaustive estimation. We further develop a generalizable framework for DEM error retrieval applicable to various scenarios. Validation with simulated and real-world data from urban and mountainous environments demonstrates effective separation of DEM errors from various spatiotemporal deformation signals.

 Crown base height (CBH) is essential for characterizing forest vertical structure over time for sustainable forest management and serves as a key input in fire model and growth model. At plot level, the average CBH (CBHa) is mainly used to assess tree growth and construct biomass models while the minimum CBH (CBHmin) can indicate the fire risk and fire behaviour. However, there are currently few CBH products available at a national or global scale. Close-range light detection and ranging (Lidar) has shown great potential in collecting plot-level forest structure parameters and can be easily scaled up to national or global scale. But considering the integrity of point clouds, CBH estimation utilizing airborne Lidar data would be always overestimated compared with other close-range Lidar data such as TLS data or backpack data. This is mainly because of the significant difference in density between the upper and lower point clouds, as well as lacking considering the tree shape. By filling the point clouds with the same density and lowering the CBH condition which considers the tree shape, we proposed an improved CBH estimation method to reduce the overestimation when using airborne Lidar data. Verified by field-measured data in six plots, the proposed method improved the root-mean-square error (RMSE) by nearly 50 % compared with the original method. The mean absolute error (MAE) was 0.694 m, R2 was 0.777 and the RMSE was 1.039 m for the validation trees. Facing different sensors and point densities, this method generally generates stable CBH estimation results. Then, we developed a newly tree-based framework that uses machine learning and multiple source remote sensing data for generating CBH products across China. We collected over 1117 km2 close-range Lidar data and used the proposed method for estimating CBH. The CBH estimation results were converted to average value and minimum value in a 1 km × 1 km plot and served as training data to generate CBH maps across China at 1 km resolution. To our best knowledge, this is the first CBH map across China, and also the first national-scale average and minimum CBH maps around the world. The results showed that the average CBHa and CBHmin were 6.76 m and 2.70 m with standard deviations of 1.59 m and 0.85 m. The methods and maps would provide a new dimension in monitoring changes in forest structure, assessing fire risk and constructing biomass models in future studies."

 The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Global Land Surface Phenology (GLSP) product (VNP22Q2 C2) has been operationally produced since 2013, and is designed to provide annual measurements of the phenologies of vegetated land surfaces at the global scale, succeeding the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Cover Dynamics (LCD) product (MCD12Q2 C61), which was first produced in 2001. Although separate validations have been conducted locally to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the detected phenometrics for each product, a comprehensive understanding of the differences between these two operational products is important for downstream applications. Therefore, this study conducted critical analyses and cross-comparisons of the land surface phenology (LSP) products to ensure long-term continuity in the global phenological dynamics. Specifically, we compared five LSP products at 500 m spatial resolution: two NASA operational products of MCD12Q2 C61 and VNP22Q2 C2, as well as three other LSP products that were generated by applying the VNP22Q2 C2 algorithm to different time series from NOAA-20 VIIRS only, both SNPP and NOAA-20 VIIRS, and MODIS on Aqua and Terra. First, we cross-validated the five products at 500 m using a high-quality reference LSP dataset at 30 m that was generated by fusing the Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) observations with near-surface PhenoCam time series across diverse ecosystems in North America, Europe, and Japan. Second, cross-comparisons were conducted between the five LSP products at 500 m across 12 golden tiles. Third, the long-term comparability and continuity between the MCD12Q2 C61 and the VNP22Q2 C2 products were assessed globally. These comprehensive evaluations demonstrated that the VNP22Q2 C2 product provides overall global continuity for the MCD12Q2 C61 record. Compared to independent reference data from the HLS-PhenoCam LSP product, the four LSP products derived from the VNP22Q2 C2 algorithm produced highly comparable results with a mean absolute difference (MAD) of ∼ 11 days and mean systematic bias (MSB) of ∼ 7 days. The cross-comparisons indicated a strong agreement among the five 500 m LSP products in the 12 selected golden tiles with MADs < 7 days; however, their agreement with the MCD12Q2 C61 was slightly lower with MADs ∼ 9–10 days. The global-scale evidence of continuity between the MCD12Q2 C61 and VNP22Q2 C2 products was an absolute difference of < 15 days, except in arid/semiarid, tropical, and high-latitude ecosystems. Finally, it is suggested that (1) the continuity from MODIS to VIIRS LSP products would be enhanced if the same phenological detection algorithm was applied to the MODIS data, and (2) the quality of the VIIRS GLSP product could be improved by integrating data from multiple VIIRS sensors."

 Extreme flood disasters are intensified by climate change, exposing an increasing share of the global population to flood hazards. Accurate monitoring of inundation extents during floods is crucial for disaster management and impact assessment. While remote sensing can provide strong support for flood monitoring, optical satellite images often face significant challenges due to weather conditions and infrequent revisits, particularly in cloudy and rainy regions. To address this limitation and achieve seamless flood mapping with cloudy satellite images, this paper proposes TerrainFloodSense, a novel method that fuses water occurrence with terrain data to enhance the reconstruction of cloud-covered flooding areas, especially under extreme and unprecedented flood scenarios. Specifically, TerrainFloodSense first generates enhanced water occurrence data by Bayesian fusion of terrain indices, including Digital Surface Model (DSM) along with Height Above the Nearest Drainage (HAND), and historical water occurrence data. Then, enhanced water occurrence data are used to fill gaps caused by clouds in water maps derived from optical satellite images, guided by the submaximal stability assumption. The basic idea is that prior terrain information can be incorporated into the initial water occurrence data to enhance the ability to predict the inundation probabilities for both regular pre-flood water and extreme floodwater and to help reconstruction of cloud-covered flooding areas even under extreme flooding scenarios. Simulated experiments and applications in large-area flood mapping cases confirmed that TerrainFloodSense significantly outperformed existing methods, achieving absolute accuracy improvements of 2.95%–8.86% in overall accuracy and 0.038–0.087 increases in F1-Score under extreme flooding scenarios. This study demonstrated that the fusion of water occurrence and terrain data can effectively improve seamless flood mapping by using optical satellite images, supporting disaster monitoring and impact assessment in cloudy and rainy environments.

 Urban Quality of Life (UQoL) assessment is essential for improving well-being and guiding urban planning. While most studies focus on developed countries using household surveys and satellite imagery, this study addresses the gaps pertaining to the quantification of UQoL at a very microscale by utilizing multi-modal 2D and 3D data, viz. elevation-stacked Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery, Google Street View (GSV) imagery, and amenities information derived from crowdsourced OpenStreetMap (OSM). An Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) based Deep Learning (DL) pipeline is implemented to segment UAV imagery, extracting indicators like built-up and green cover from the segmentation maps. Additionally, DeepLabV3 is used to segment GSV imagery to compute the sky-view factor, while OSM is employed to extract the location information of amenities. The UDA-based ResiDualGAN, equipped with a convolutional resizer model and integrated with the OSA method, trained on the RGB-nDSM dataset, achieved an IoU of 60.48%. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to create a weighted UQoL index. The results reveal disparities in UQoL across the study area, with higher UQoL in green, amenity-rich regions, emphasizing the importance of utility access. Notably, informal settlements located near essential services exhibited high UQoL despite having limited green cover and higher built-up density, which clearly emphasizes the importance of proximity as a key indicator of UQoL."

 Tree decline affects many perennial orchards with potentially heavy impacts on production. In five years 3 % of national production of kiwifruit orchards were lost in France, leading to economic issues and jeopardizing the value chain. Some specific management practices could help to mitigate kiwifruit decline, but rapid and simple tools are needed to assess the development of the decline in response to these practices. As kiwifruit decline is characterized by a low-vigor canopy along with changes in canopy color and density, Sentinel-2 images were used to detect vine decline over large areas. We first selected 28 orchards, with varying characteristics (e.g. row grass cover, hail protection nets, fertilization practices) and characterized each vine (14000 in total) according to its agronomic status (i.e. vigor and presence of decline symptoms). Sentinel-2 images are made up of 10 x 10 m pixels. To classify them we fitted two models using a random forest procedure. The spectral model (SM) used only spectral inputs, while the agronomic and spectral model (ASM) used both spectral inputs from satellite images and agronomic inputs obtained from orchard characteristics. Spectral inputs included raw spectral bands (e.g., red, near-infrared, green) and vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, GNDVI). Results show that vigorous and dead areas were well detected (more than 80 % of correct predictions). Declining areas were correctly detected when patches of decline were larger than 500 m2. Mixed pixels containing vines with different agronomic status were poorly predicted. Accuracy improves when agronomic information, such as soil texture, is incorporated into the model. Both models (SM and ASM) could enable growers to adjust their practices in real time according to the health status of their vines."

In this study, we developed the first national-scale models for Sweden to estimate the abundance of cervid forage by combining data from the National Forest Inventory (NFI) and different remote sensing (RS) datasets. We focused on six key forage tree species for cervids in Sweden: Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), birch (Betula spp.), European aspen (Populus tremula), rowan (Sorbus aucuparia), oak (Quercus spp.), and goat willow (Salix caprea).We combined airborne laser scanning and other auxiliary RS data with NFI data from 2016 to 2022 to model small tree abundance from 19 461 plots across Sweden in an area-based approach. We fitted generalized linear mixed models using likelihood-ratio tests to predict species-specific forage availability. Models were validated using an independent dataset of NFI data collected in 2023. Our models demonstrated moderate to strong predictive performance, with marginal R2 values ranging from 0.226 to 0.973. Model validation suggested higher RMSE and rRMSE values for tree species that are scarce throughout the country than for more abundant species.We provide maps for all six modelled tree species, both at a 1 ha and a 1 km2 spatial scale, with the aim for them to be used in wildlife management, forestry planning, and ecological research. Our map products can for example help stakeholders assess a region’s spatial distribution of cervid forage and thus inform habitat management and potentially mitigate browsing-related economic losses in forestry."

 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are among the important pollutant groups because of their tremendous emissions and distribution in different environmental media. This study presented comprehensive PAH concentrations from olive leaves and ambient air samples collected over one year. The average concentrations of Σ12PAH in olive leaves and ambient air were 565 ± 402 ng/g DW and 22.4 ± 3.4 ng/m3, respectively. During warmer months, both leaf and ambient air samples exhibited reduced PAH concentrations. The leaf exchange is essential for understanding the accumulation of organic pollutants in trees. Some models estimate the exchange of pollutants between the air and leaves to understand their transport paths. In this study, eleven different models with various parameters were incorporated into the data. Although the octanol/air partition coefficient (KOA) was found to be the most influential parameter in the employed models, the physical and chemical parameters of the plant, including moisture, air, and lipid content, were effective in the partition. The leaf/air partition coefficient (KLA) was used to determine the direction of PAH movement. Calculated logKLA values in the models ranged from 5.5 to 14. PAH compounds with log KOA values less than 10 showed a similar trend and were close to each other for all models evaluated in this study.

 Air pollution is one of the major public health issues worldwide. Exposure to air pollution has been linked to various health-related issues, including respiratory and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, although the exact pathophysiological mechanism remains elusive. The main focus of this study was to investigate the association between inflammatory and oxidative stress responses to indoor air pollution exposure. This study investigated the effect of indoor pollutants generated from biomass burning on biomarkers (i.e., Clara cell protein (CC16), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and 8-hydrox-2′-deoxyguanosine [8-OHdG]). One hundred healthy rural women aged 25–65 were recruited to investigate their cardiopulmonary health, blood biomarkers, and pollution status inside their kitchen rooms. Pollutant concentrations were monitored indoors with the time-activity of carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5, PM1), total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs), and formaldehyde (HCHO). Serum samples were analyzed for biomarkers using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) to ensure precise measurements and enhanced sensitivity. Study results revealed higher particulate and gaseous pollutant concentrations in kitchen rooms of biomass users (p < 0.001). In unadjusted analysis, baseline serum levels of CRP (7.96 vs. 1.68 mg/L; p < 0.001), IL-8 (51.26 vs. 9.56 pg/mL; p < 0.001), 8-OHdG (71.74 vs. 26.23 ng/mL; p < 0.001) and LDH (335.1 vs. 227.65 U/L; p < 0.001) were increased in biomass-exposed vs. clean fuel users, respectively, whereas serum levels of CC16 (4846.68 ± 832.37 pg/mL; p < 0.001) were decreased. Study results revealed that particulate matter has strong positive correlations with CRP and IL-8 and a negative association with CC16 among biomass users. These findings suggest that chronic exposure to indoor pollutants may be associated with differences in markers of inflammation, lung epithelial injury, and oxidative DNA damage among tribal women. Further, this study may help explain abnormal cardiovascular and respiratory complications among rural tribal biomass fuel users."
