In this study, we use reconstructions and model simulations to investigate the ratio of global mean air versus sea surface temperature change (S) during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The simulated S at the LGM is 1.97 ± 0.22 (1σ), 44 ± 16% greater than under future warming, primarily due to the influence of elevated continental ice sheets. Results reveal that the glacial air‐sea cooling contrast is negatively related to the magnitude of sea surface cooling, consistent with a simple moist static energy theory. This relationship can be used to constrain S, further suggesting a median LGM surface cooling of −5.6°C. These results caution against the use of a fixed S under different climate background and have implications for paleotemperature reconstructions and climate projections."

In this study, we present the global distribution of whistler mode waves in the magnetosheath and their dependence on solar wind parameters, based on 7 years of data from three Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) probes. Our findings reveal that whistler mode waves in magnetosheath peak near noon, spanning from 9 to 15 magnetic local times, with amplitudes reaching up to 100 pT. Furthermore, whistler mode wave amplitudes and occurrence rates are slightly larger on the dawnside than duskside. Additionally, whistler mode wave amplitudes tend to increase with increasing solar wind dynamic pressure and cone angle. These results provide valuable insights into the plasma and wave environment right upstream of Earth's magnetopause under various solar wind conditions."

However, its seasonal prediction remains challenging. While recent studies have identified stratospheric pathways for improving SNAO prediction, the role of tropospheric wave dynamics remains unclear. Using a latest‐generation large‐ensemble seasonal forecasting system, we find that the model exhibits limited SNAO prediction skill and underestimates downstream climate impacts. These limitations are associated with deficiencies in circumglobal waveguide dynamics. Subsampling ensemble members that best capture circulation anomalies near circumglobal teleconnection centers or tropical/monsoon rainfall that forces the teleconnection is accompanied by significantly improved SNAO prediction. Furthermore, deficiencies in the model circumglobal waveguide, particularly over the Mediterranean and North Atlantic with underestimated background zonal winds and erroneous curvature, may disrupt wave propagation. Refining these dynamical features could improve teleconnection representation and SNAO prediction, aiding summer climate risk mitigation."

Its primary sink is oxidation by the hydroxyl radical (OH), making it a key tracer for estimating atmospheric oxidative capacity. Following Montreal Protocol regulations, MCF emissions declined rapidly after the 1990s. However, the recent atmospheric MCF decay suggests persistent emissions and/or declining OH (contradicting chemistry‐climate models projecting increasing or stable OH). The air‐sea exchange of MCF has been poorly constrained due to limited observations and simplified ocean representations. We simulate oceanic MCF fluxes using a modern ocean reanalysis and validate with depth‐resolved observations. Results suggest the ocean has shifted from a net sink to a net source around 2005, outgassing 0.5 Gg yr−1 in the 2010s (up to 30% of inferred MCF emissions). This ocean outgassing is an order of magnitude larger than previous estimates, and accounts for up to a third of the model‐observation discrepancy in OH."

Observations since 1979 reveal a pronounced strengthening of the boreal spring WPHC in the Northern Hemisphere, but the contributions of internal variability versus external forcing remain unclear. Using large ensemble simulations, we find that approximately 71% of the recent strengthening is attributed to phase transitions in three key sea surface temperature (SST) gradients—tropical Western Pacific (TWP)‐Western North Pacific, TWP‐Tropical Eastern Pacific, and TWP‐Tropical Indian Ocean, indicating an internal variability mode linked to the inter‐basin SST gradient. Constraining future projections with skillful ensemble members based on these gradient phases reduces projection uncertainty by nearly 49% and suggests a likely weakening in coming decades. These results highlight the dominant role of internal variability and the importance of accurately representing tropical SST gradients for near‐term regional HC projections."

Using data from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites and Meteorological Operational satellite‐C, we investigate the energetic proton fluxes and east‐west flux ratios in geostationary orbit, as well as the cutoff L $L$‐shells measured in low Earth orbit during these events. For the first time, we find the rigidity dependence of the correlations between the east‐west proton flux ratios and the Kp $Kp$ index, the Dst $Dst$ index, and solar wind dynamic pressure. The corresponding correlation coefficients significantly increase and then decrease with the increase of proton rigidity. Such non‐monotonic variation can be well explained by the penumbral rigidity cutoffs of penetrating protons in west‐looking and east‐looking directions. The results suggest the strong influence of geomagnetic shielding on SEP penetration."

Keith Fifield;David M. Etheridge;Mariana L. di Tada;Kexin Liu;Richard G. Cresswell;Melita D. Keywood,The 36Cl Bomb‐Pulse in Ice at a High‐Accumulation Site in Antarctica,"The radioisotope 36Cl was produced prolifically by nuclear weapons testing, principally at Bikini and Enewetak Atolls in the 1950s. Much of this was injected into the stratosphere, from where it was dispersed worldwide. The fallout of this bomb‐produced 36Cl has been measured as a function of time in an ice core from a high‐accumulation site in Antarctica. These measurements complement an earlier study in an Arctic ice core. A box model has been developed to describe simultaneously the data from both the two sites. Using an up‐to‐date catalog, the 36Cl production of the individual tests has been estimated and used as input to the box model. Production is dominated by high‐yield thermonuclear tests carried out on barges moored in the lagoons of the atolls in the 1950s. Exchange times of 3.7 years for gaseous exchange between stratosphere and troposphere and 4.2 years for gaseous exchange between the stratospheres of the two hemispheres are deduced. The 36Cl bomb pulse constitutes a global tracer with an input function that is well‐defined in space and time, and its exchange between stratosphere and troposphere is dominated by one‐way transport due to its rapid removal once in the troposphere. This latter behavior greatly simplifies the interpretation of the data in terms of an exchange time relative to the 14C bomb pulse. The stratosphere‐troposphere exchange time derived here from the bomb‐produced 36Cl offers an independent constraint on the flux of ozone between stratosphere and troposphere which agrees well with other more direct estimates."

We detect ARs for 1950–2023 using integrated water vapor transport (IVT) dual percentile thresholds with morphological filtering for elongated, persistent features; attribute precipitation, extreme precipitation, runoff, and soil moisture via a 1.5° axis buffer; model contributions with zero‐inflated beta (ZIB) regression; and trace moisture sources during AR‐driven floods with TROVA. Results reveal a south‐to‐north contrast, with southern basins exhibiting high summer IVT (∼600–1,100 kg m−1 s−1) from long ARs (∼13,000 km) that sustain antecedent wetness and amplify floods, while since the 1980s ARs have shortened and weakened, and hydrologic responses have declined in central and northern basins. Basin mean ARs contributions peak in the Huai River Basin (16.5%, 70.0%, 17.9%, 3.2%) and are lowest in the Southwest Basin (0.1%, 0.8%, 0.1%, 0.04%) for precipitation, extreme precipitation, runoff, and soil moisture, respectively. ZIB indicates a declining mean AR influence on soil moisture in the east and increasing shares of extremes in the southeast; antecedent soil moisture is the strongest covariate of AR‐induced precipitation. During floods, dominant sources can reach 74.7% from the East Asia Monsoon (Yangtze River Basin, 1998), 55.6% from the West Pacific Tropics (Pearl River Basin, 2009), and 32.5% from the South Asia Monsoon (Pearl River Basin, 1985).

Here, the authors show that contractile forces drive lysosomes to the cell edge, where they activate Rac1 and trigger leader cell emergence. 
 Collective cell migration during embryonic development, wound healing, and cancer metastasis requires the emergence of leader cells at the migration front. Despite their physiological relevance, the full mechanisms underlying the emergence of leader cells remain elusive. Here we report that leader cells display a peripheral accumulation of lysosomes in diverse model systems for wound healing, including cultured epithelial monolayer, mouse embryonic skin, and Drosophila embryos. This accumulation involves cellular contractile forces driving lysosomal transport along microtubules towards the leading edge. Indeed, we control leader cell emergence by manipulating lysosomal movement on microtubules. We further find that peripheral lysosomes associate with Rac1 molecules at the leading periphery, regulating local Rac1-activity, triggering actin polymerization and promoting lamellipodium formation. Taken together, we demonstrate that beyond their catabolic role, lysosomes act as an intracellular platform that links mechanical and biochemical signals to control the emergence of leader cells. During collective migration, only a few cells become leaders that guide tissue movement. Here, the authors show that contractile forces drive lysosomes to the cell edge, where they activate Rac1 and trigger leader cell emergence."

 What humans look at and do when freely viewing a scene is not well understood. We measure observer eye movements under different instructions while participants view a customized set of image pairs containing small visual alterations that greatly change scene interpretation (Winograd images). We show that free-viewing fixations resemble those of observers describing scenes but differ from those of observers counting or searching for objects. Fixations are more often directed toward people and objects whose removal most alters scene interpretation, rather than toward the most salient or meaningfully judged regions (meaning maps), or objects perceived to be grasped or gazed at. Small image changes that modify scene understanding (Winograd images), but not salience or meaning maps, alter fixation patterns. By instructing observers to describe scenes while fixating on objects either relevant or irrelevant to scene understanding, we demonstrate that free-viewing eye movements are functionally important for accurate scene comprehension. Thus, an important human default task of free viewing eye movements is to comprehend scenes. People often look around without a specific task in mind (free viewing).

 Mining is a major driver of deforestation, yet the full scale of its contribution to global natural forest loss and associated carbon emissions remains obscured by the incomplete inventories of mining activities. Here, we present a comprehensive global mining inventory, including 236,028 mining areas with an overall accuracy of 87.37% to quantify direct deforestation and the associated forest carbon emissions from mining activities between 2001 and 2023. Our results reveal that mining-induced deforestation is two to three times higher than previous estimates from existing datasets, accounting for 19,765 km2 of deforestation with associated emissions of 0.75 Pg CO2 over this period. Notably, over half (50.29%) of this deforestation is linked to unrecorded mining activities. These findings highlight the substantially underestimated role of mining, particularly informal and unrecorded activities, in driving global deforestation and climate change, underscoring the urgent need for improved monitoring and regulation of mining impacts on the environment across regions.

Here, the authors use linked electronic health records from England and Wales to investigate the association between oral antibiotic use and survival in women with breast cancer. 
 The role of the gut microbiota in carcinogenesis is increasingly being acknowledged. Recent studies in multiple breast cancer mouse models have found that antibiotics, by altering the gut microbiota, can accelerate tumour growth. In humans, a recent cohort study restricted to triple negative breast cancer showed that breast cancer patients using a greater number of antibiotics had markedly worse survival. These studies have raised concerns about repeated antibiotic use in breast cancer patients. In this Registered Report, we investigated whether breast cancer patients using oral antibiotics had increased breast cancer-specific mortality. In population-based cohorts (n = 44,452), we did not observe a statistically significant association between antibiotic prescriptions after diagnosis and breast cancer-specific mortality (adjusted HR = 1.07 95% CI 0.87, 1.33) apart from prescriptions of 12 or more antibiotics (adjusted HR = 1.62 95% CI 1.31, 2.01). This association was weaker after adjustment for infections (adjusted HR = 1.44 95% 1.14, 1.81), when restricted to antibiotics within five years (adjusted HR = 1.33 95% 0.95, 1.84), and was similar for deaths from other causes (adjusted HR = 1.69 95% 1.19, 2.41). Frequent antibiotic users had higher cancer-specific mortality but the attenuation of associations in sensitivity analyses, and similar findings for other causes of death, suggest this increase may reflect residual confounding.

 Electrochemical dechlorination provides a sustainable method to treat chlorinated volatile organic compounds polluted water with producing value-added hydrocarbon. However, dechlorination of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) generates *CH3 and *CH2Cl intermediates, which are highly unstable due to lack of efficient hyperconjugation from neighboring carbon sites. Herein, we report that cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) grafts onto sulfur-doped graphene toward efficient electrocatalysis of CH2Cl2 dechlorination at moderate potentials. It reveals that sulfoxide groups within graphene linked to Co sites by an axial coordination, resulting in an electron donation effect to decrease the barriers of elemental dechlorination step.

The production rate of CH4 is significantly enhanced compares to the current level, and an additional case of producing C2H4 and C2H6 is achieved. For potential practical application, the electrochemical dechlorination of a diluted CH2Cl2 solution is validated in an electrofiltration module setup by an efficient flow-through mode. Electrochemical dechlorination provides a sustainable method to treat chlorinated volatile organic compounds polluted water and produce value-added hydrocarbon.

Here, the authors show how pathogen-derived compounds regulate host EV production showcasing new insight into how animals anticipate and prepare themselves for infection. 
 In natural environments, animals encounter pathogen-derived chemicals long before infection occurs. How such anticipatory cues influence extracellular vesicle (EV) dynamics, which are central to immune regulation, intercellular communication, and stress responses, remains unknown. Using Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that pathogen-derived volatile and non-volatile compounds trigger distinct EV pathways through separate sensory and molecular mechanisms. Non-volatile secretome components, including the tripeptide Ile-Pro-Pro, activate immune-dependent EV production, whereas volatile metabolites elicit immunity-independent EV formation. Both responses require sensory input from ASK, ADL, and AWC neurons and converge on a neural circuit involving RMG, AIB, and AIA interneurons. GPCRs SRI-19, SRI-36/39, and SRR-6 mediate non-volatile responses, with SRR-6 acting in the intestine to regulate muscle EVs release. Notably, pre-exposure to pathogen volatiles enhances offspring survival during subsequent infection in an SRI-19–dependent manner, suggesting a predictive, intergenerational benefit of pathogen detection. In summary, our findings uncover that pathogen-derived chemical cues shape host EV production via specialized sensory circuits, revealing how animals anticipate infection and prime protective physiological responses. Extracellular vesicles are central to immune regulation and stress responses. Here, the authors show how pathogen-derived compounds regulate host EV production showcasing new insight into how animals anticipate and prepare themselves for infection."

 Initiating aripiprazole as antipsychotic monotherapy rather than olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone, might prevent/delay major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) over the long-term in people diagnosed with severe mental illness. Using Clinical Practice Research Datalink data, we emulated a trial of aripiprazole versus olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone in 20,404 patients 2005–2014. Primary outcome was five-year MACE risk (composite of hospitalisation for acute myocardial infarction or stroke and cardiovascular death). Here we show that patients initiating aripiprazole had a similar five-year MACE risk as those initiating olanzapine (risk ratio: 1.03, 95% CI, 0.78-1.32), quetiapine (1.02, 95% CI, 0.72-1.32), and risperidone (0.88, 95% CI, 0.67-1.17). Risk was lower among patients initiating and continuing aripiprazole versus risperidone (0.58, 95% CI, 0.39-0.84). For patients at clinical equipoise, antipsychotic selection does not appear to significantly impact risk of the most severe, long-term cardiovascular events. However, further research is needed to replicate our finding of increased risk with continued risperidone use versus aripiprazole. Initiating aripiprazole antipsychotic monotherapy versus olanzapine, quetiapine or risperidone might reduce cardiovascular event risk in severe mental illness.

 In this phase 2 trial, patients diagnosed with locally advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma underwent three cycles of neoadjuvant therapy comprising serplulimab, carboplatin, and albumin paclitaxel.

 Photosynthesis drives carbon into terrestrial ecosystems via gross primary production (GPP), rising ~3% decade−1 globally, paralleled by green leaf area expansion. Both trends stem from CO2 fertilization (CFE), climate change, and landcover change, yet spatial mismatches exist between GPP and leaf area changes. Canopy scale GPP changes are separated into those resulting from leaf area changes and those from changing photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area. The latter, by normalizing for leaf area, isolate production dependency on CO2, light and water availability, and the kinetics of the process itself. Arid/semi-arid shrublands and grasslands show substantial CO2 assimilation gains, dominated by CFE and beneficial climate effects. Conversely, croplands and forests exhibit declining leaf assimilation rate due to increased shading from excessive greening and adverse climate shifts (e.g., reduced precipitation, higher VPD). The Sudano-Sahelian zone exemplifies assimilation increases in sparse vegetation, while conspicuously greening regions like China and India face assimilation declines. This pattern of canopy GPP increases from gains in both leaf scale assimilation rates and leaf area in sparse vegetation of inhospitable climes, and only from leaf area gains in more productive vegetation of favorable environments, whilst counter-intuitive, suggests an unforeseen potential for carbon sequestration in sparsely vegetated lands. Vegetation in arid regions benefits from higher leaf-scale assimilation rates and expanded leaf area, boosting carbon uptake, while productive forests and croplands experience declines due to increased shading and climate stress, based on remote sensing data and multiple process-based models."

 Large-scale ecological restoration has enhanced ecosystem services, but its impacts on terrestrial water storage (TWS) remain debated. Our study challenges the prevailing assumption that restoration activities inevitably reduce TWS. Here we construct a long-term TWS record (1987-2020) to analyze hydrological dynamics in the Mu Us Sandyland in China, a region undergoing intensified ecological restoration since 1999. Our findings delineate three distinct hydrological phases: stable pre-restoration conditions (1987-1998), rapid TWS depletion (2003-2010), and subsequent unintended recovery (2011-2020). Satellite and modeling data reveal that ecological restoration and agricultural expansion initially reduce TWS through enhanced plant transpiration, while vegetation-mediated atmospheric feedback later appears to boost regional precipitation. Climate projections suggest this region may experience 51%-351% TWS growth by 2100 even under the climate-resilient SSP1-2.6 scenario, potentially supporting regional water sustainability. These findings revise our understanding of ecological-water interactions, showing that well-designed ecological restoration may overcome initial water deficits through climate system adaptation.
