10.1088/1748-9326/ad6f2d,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究主要关注澳大利亚北部热带稀树草原的牲畜生产与环境可持续性之间的平衡。研究使用了一个整合的时空模型来评估不同全球变化情景下，改变放牧率、火灾管理和补充牛的饮食以减少甲烷排放等措施的有效性。研究结果表明，维持历史放牧率在气候变化的背景下会导致土地退化加剧，并且在经济上不可持续。而通过提前干季燃烧和降低放牧率，可以有效减少温室气体排放，并提高经济效益。研究重点在于通过管理措施来实现牲畜生产与环境可持续性之间的平衡，并没有涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析。,"['Greenhouse gas emissions', 'methane emissions', 'fire management', 'land degradation', 'carbon price']",Rebecca K Runting;Darran King;Martin Nolan;Javier Navarro;Raymundo Marcos-Martinez;Jonathan R Rhodes;Lei Gao;Ian Watson;Andrew Ash;April E Reside;Jorge G Álvarez-Romero;Jessie A Wells;Euan G Ritchie;Michalis Hadjikakou;Don A Driscoll;Jeffery D Connor;Jonathan Garber;Brett A Bryan,Balancing livestock production and environmental outcomes in northern Australia’s tropical savanna under global change,"Livestock production is an integral part of the global food system and the livelihoods of local people, but it also raises questions of environmental sustainability due to issues such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, biodiversity decline, land degradation, and water use. Further challenges to extensive livestock systems may arise from changes in climate and the global economy (particularly variation in prices for livestock and carbon). However, significant potential exists for both mitigating these impacts and adapting to change via altering stocking rates, managing fire, and supplementing cattle diets to reduce methane emissions. We developed an integrated, spatio-temporal modelling approach to assess the effectiveness of these options for land management in northern Australia’s tropical savanna under different global change scenarios. Performance was measured against a range of sustainability indicators, including environmental (GHG emissions, biodiversity, water intake, and land condition) and agricultural (profit, beef production) outcomes. Our model shows that maintaining historical stocking rates is not environmentally sustainable due to the accelerated land degradation exacerbated by a changing climate. However, planned early dry season burning substantially reduced emissions, and in our simulations was profitable under all global change scenarios that included a carbon price. Overall, the balance between production and environmental outcomes could be improved by stocking below modelled carrying capacity and implementing fire management. This management scenario was the most profitable (more than double the profit from maintaining historical stocking rates), prevented land degradation, and reduced GHG emissions by 23%. By integrating the cumulative impacts of climate change, external economic drivers, and management actions across a range of sustainability indicators, we show that the future of rangelands in Australia’s savannas has the potential to balance livestock production and environmental outcomes."

This is usually measured by lidar, which has limitations, most notably the assumption of a lidar ratio. Our study shows that routine surface-level aerosol measurements are able to predict this lidar ratio reasonably well within the lower layers of the atmosphere and thus provide a relatively simple and cost-effective method to improve lidar measurements. 
 In this study, we utilised ground-based in situ measurements of the aerosol chemical composition and particle size distribution, along with meteorological data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), to predict vertical profiles of aerosol optical properties, including the aerosol scattering coefficient, backscatter coefficient, extinction coefficient, and lidar ratio. The predicted ambient profiles were compared to retrievals by a multi-wavelength Raman lidar during the Ruisdael Land–Atmosphere Interactions Intensive Trace-gas and Aerosol (RITA) campaign in the Netherlands in 2021 for 26 time periods of approximately 1 h each. Predicted and retrieved extensive aerosol properties (scattering, backscatter, and extinction coefficient) were comparable only approximately 35 % of the time, mostly under the condition of well-mixed boundary layers. In this case, ground-based measurements can provide a way to extend extinction profiles to lower altitudes, where they cannot be retrieved, and to verify the lidar-measured profiles. Accurate representation of hygroscopic growth is required for adjusting the dry size distribution to ambient size distribution, and the estimated relative humidity profile may have a substantial influence on the shape of the calculated profiles. On the other hand, the lidar ratio profiles predicted by ground-based data also compared reasonably well to the retrieved lidar profiles (starting at 800 m) for conditions where the predicted and retrieved backscatter profiles differed considerably. The difference in the predicted and retrieved lidar ratio is usually less than ±30 %. Our study thus shows that, for well-mixed boundary layers, a representative lidar ratio can be estimated from ground-based in situ measurements of chemical composition and dry size distribution. This approach offers a method of providing lidar ratios calculated from independent in situ measurements for simple backscatter lidars or at times when Raman lidar profiles cannot be measured (e.g. during the daytime). It only uses data that are routinely available at aerosol measurement stations and is therefore not only useful for further validating lidar measurements but also for bridging the gap between in situ measurements and lidar remote sensing."

Flynn;James C. Barnard;Brian D. Ermold;Jennifer M. Comstock,Shortwave Array Spectroradiometer-Hemispheric (SAS-He): design and evaluation,"Conventional ground-based radiometers commonly measure solar radiation at a few wavelengths within a narrow spectral range. These limitations prevent improved retrievals of aerosol, cloud, and surface characteristics. To address these limitations, an advanced ground-based radiometer with expanded spectral coverage and hyperspectral capability is introduced. Its good performance is demonstrated using reference data collected over three coastal regions with diverse types of aerosols and clouds. 
 A novel ground-based radiometer, referred to as the Shortwave Array Spectroradiometer-Hemispheric (SAS-He), is introduced. This radiometer uses the shadow-band technique to report total irradiance and its direct and diffuse components frequently (every 30 s) with continuous spectral   coverage (350–1700 nm) and moderate spectral (∼ 2.5 nm ultraviolet–visible and ∼ 6 nm shortwave-infrared) resolution. The SAS-He's performance is evaluated using integrated datasets collected over coastal regions during three field campaigns supported by the US Department of Energy's  Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program, namely the (1) Two-Column Aerosol Project (TCAP; Cape Cod, Massachusetts), (2) Tracking Aerosol Convection Interactions Experiment (TRACER; in and around Houston, Texas), and (3) Eastern Pacific Cloud Aerosol Precipitation Experiment (EPCAPE; La Jolla, California). We compare (i) aerosol optical depth (AOD) and total optical depth (TOD) derived from the direct irradiance, as well as (ii) the diffuse irradiance and direct-to-diffuse ratio (DDR) calculated from two components of the total irradiance. As part of the evaluation, both AOD and TOD derived from the SAS-He direct irradiance are compared to those provided by a collocated Cimel sunphotometer (CSPHOT) at five (380, 440, 500, 675, 870 nm) and two (1020, 1640 nm) wavelengths, respectively. Additionally, the SAS-He diffuse irradiance and  DDR  are contrasted with their counterparts offered by a collocated multifilter rotating shadowband radiometer (MFRSR) at six (415, 500, 615, 675, 870, 1625 nm) wavelengths. Overall, reasonable agreement is demonstrated between the compared products despite the challenging observational conditions associated with varying aerosol loadings and diverse types of aerosols and clouds. For example, the AOD- and TOD-related values of root mean square error remain within 0.021 at 380, 440, 500, 675, 870, 1020, and 1640 nm wavelengths during the three field campaigns."

Kteeba and Laodong Guo,Photodegradation Processes and Weathering Products of Microfibers in Aquatic Environments,"Microplastics, particularly microfibers (MFs), pose a significant threat to the environment. Despite their widespread presence, the photochemical reactivity, weathering products, and environmental fate of MFs remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, photodegradation experiments were conducted on three prevalent MFs: polyester (POL), nylon (NYL), and acrylic (ACR), to elucidate their degradation pathways, changes in surface morphology and polymer structure, and chemical and colloidal characterization of weathering products during photochemical degradation of MFs. The results showed that concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, chromophoric dissolved organic matter (DOM), and fluorescent components consistently increased during weathering, exhibiting a continuous release of DOM. Scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy revealed changes in the surface morphology and polymer spectra of the MFs. During the weathering experiments, DOM aromaticity (SUVA254) decreased, while spectral slope increased, indicating concurrent DOM release and degradation of aromatic components. The released DOM or nanoplastics were negatively charged with sizes between 128 and 374 nm. The production rate constants of DOM or the photochemical reactivity of MFs followed the order ACR > NYL ≥ POL, consistent with their differences in chemical structures. These findings provide an improved understanding of the photochemical reactivity, degradation pathways, weathering products, and environmental fate of microfibers in the environment."

However, current CNF membranes face limitations in conductivity, structural stability, and nanochannel control strategies. This work addresses these challenges by introducing aniline-functionalized carbon nanotubes (NH2-CNTs) as an interlayer. NH2-CNTs enhance the dispersibility and adhesion of pristine carbon nanotubes, leading to a more conductive and stable composite nanofiltration membrane. The redesigned NH2-CNTs interlayered conductive nanofiltration (NICNF) membrane exhibits a 10-fold increase in conductivity and a high response degree (80%) with excellent cyclic stability, surpassing existing CNF membranes. The synergistic effects of enhanced Donnan exclusion, voltage switching, and electrocatalysis enable the NICNF membrane to achieve selective recovery of mixed dyes, 98.97% removal of residual wastewater toxicity, and a 5.2-fold increase in permeance compared to the commercial NF270 membrane. This research paves the way for next-generation multifunctional membranes capable of the efficient recovery and degradation of toxic organic pollutants in wastewater."

Three scenarios are evaluated: Business-as-usual (BAU) based on maintaining refrigerant and energy efficiency levels from 2021 China RAC sales shares, Kigali Amendment compliant with 10% energy efficiency improvement by 2025 (KAE), and accelerated refrigerant transition and energy efficiency improvement (ATE). Each scenario considers the costs of refrigerant and efficiency measures for export market groups based on Kigali Amendment classifications. BAU predicts around 1 Gt CO2-eq average annual global RAC emissions (2022–2060). Cumulative emission reductions in China’s RAC manufacturing under KAE and ATE are 12.2 and 17.2 Gt CO2-eq A5II and A5I (except China), presenting cost-effective abatement measures, with average costs of -$51.4 and -$68.8/t CO2-eq in KAE and ATE. Cumulative average abatement costs are around $18 and $4/t CO2-eq globally. KAE and ATE scenarios would avoid surface temperature rises of 0.023 (±0.002) °C and 0.027 (±0.003) °C, respectively, versus BAU.

Yet, such models are more adept at predicting specific water compartments, such as soil moisture, rather than others, which consequently impedes accurately forecasting of TWS. Here we show that machine learning can be used to uncover relations between nonseasonal terms of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) derived total water storage and the preceding hydrometeorological drivers, and these relations can subsequently be used to predict water storage up to 12 months ahead, and even exceptional droughts on the basis of near real‐time observational forcing data. Validation by actual GRACE observations suggests that the method developed here has the capability to forecast trends in global land water storage for the following year. If applied in early warning systems, these predictions would better inform decision‐makers to improve current drought and water resource management."

Results showed that the Guliya dust concentration has exhibited a declining trend since the 1960s (−751 μg kg−1 yr−1). Applying an attribution approach, we discovered that low dust emission (80.3%) was the main cause of the drop in dust concentration, with changes related to transportation (5.2%) and deposition (14.5%) making only minor contributions.

Here, authors show that ferroptosis, a cell death modality driven by lipid peroxidation, is required to be suppressed by vitamin A or antioxidants to ensure proper neuronal development. 
 The development of functional neurons is a complex orchestration of multiple signaling pathways controlling cell proliferation and differentiation. Because the balance of antioxidants is important for neuronal survival and development, we hypothesized that ferroptosis must be suppressed to gain neurons. We find that removal of antioxidants diminishes neuronal development and laminar organization of cortical organoids, which is fully restored when ferroptosis is inhibited by ferrostatin-1 or when neuronal differentiation occurs in the presence of vitamin A. Furthermore, iron-overload-induced developmental growth defects in C. elegans are ameliorated by vitamin E and A. We determine that all-trans retinoic acid activates the Retinoic Acid Receptor, which orchestrates the expression of anti-ferroptotic genes. In contrast, retinal and retinol show radical-trapping antioxidant activity. Together, our study reveals an unexpected function of vitamin A in coordinating the expression of essential cellular gatekeepers of ferroptosis, and demonstrates that suppression of ferroptosis by radical-trapping antioxidants or by vitamin A is required to obtain mature neurons and proper laminar organization in cortical organoids. Neuronal development is tightly controlled by nutrients and antioxidants.

 Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) have become pivotal in achieving high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and organic solar cells (OSCs) by significantly minimizing interfacial energy losses. In this study, we propose a co-adsorb (CA) strategy employing a novel small molecule, 2-chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)isonicotinic acid (PyCA-3F), introducing at the buried interface between 2PACz and the perovskite/organic layers. This approach effectively diminishes 2PACz’s aggregation, enhancing surface smoothness and increasing work function for the modified SAM layer, thereby providing a flattened buried interface with a favorable heterointerface for perovskite. The resultant improvements in crystallinity, minimized trap states, and augmented hole extraction and transfer capabilities have propelled power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) beyond 25% in PSCs with a p-i-n structure (certified at 24.68%). OSCs employing the CA strategy achieve remarkable PCEs of 19.51% based on PM1:PTQ10:m-BTP-PhC6 photoactive system. Notably, universal improvements have also been achieved for the other two popular OSC systems. After a 1000-hour maximal power point tracking, the encapsulated PSCs and OSCs retain approximately 90% and 80% of their initial PCEs, respectively. This work introduces a facile, rational, and effective method to enhance the performance of SAMs, realizing efficiency breakthroughs in both PSCs and OSCs with a favorable p-i-n device structure, along with improved operational stability.

 The outer membrane is a formidable barrier that protects Gram-negative bacteria against environmental threats. Its integrity requires the correct folding and insertion of outer membrane proteins (OMPs) by the membrane-embedded β-barrel assembly machinery (BAM). Unfolded OMPs are delivered to BAM by the periplasmic chaperone SurA, but how SurA and BAM work together to ensure successful OMP delivery and folding remains unclear. Here, guided by AlphaFold2 models, we use disulphide bond engineering in an attempt to trap SurA in the act of OMP delivery to BAM, and solve cryoEM structures of a series of complexes. The results suggest that SurA binds BAM at its soluble POTRA-1 domain, which may trigger conformational changes in both BAM and SurA that enable transfer of the unfolded OMP to the BAM lateral gate for insertion into the outer membrane. Mutations that disrupt the interaction between BAM and SurA result in outer membrane assembly defects, supporting the key role of SurA in outer membrane biogenesis.

The authors present a method for the device characterization based on small signal analysis, enabling the determination of the electronic mobility as a function of continuous gate potential. 
 A method for the characterization of organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) based on small signal analysis is presented that allows to determine the electronic mobility as a function of continuous gate potential using a standard two-channel AC potentiostat. Vector analysis in the frequency domain allows to exclude parasitic components in both ionic and electronic conduction regardless of film thickness, thus resulting in a standard deviation as low as 4%. Besides the electronic mobility, small signal analysis of OECTs also provides information about a wide range of other parameters including the conductance, transconductance, conductivity and volumetric capacitance through a single measurement. General applicability of small signal analysis is demonstrated by characterizing devices based on n-type, p-type, and ambipolar materials operating in accumulation or depletion modes. Accurate benchmarking of organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors through small signal analysis can be anticipated to guide both materials development and the design of bioelectronic devices. Accurate determination of the performance of organic electrochemical transistors is challenging.

 Flood emergency mapping is essential for flood management, often requiring near real-time extraction of large-scale flood extents by combining pre- and post-event multi-source remote sensing images. Pre-event optical imagery delineates the normal water extent, providing a benchmark for estimation of post-flood changes. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery provides rapid and accurate interpretation of flood inundation extent during the rainy period. Post-classification comparison is one of the fundamental methods for flood mapping of multi-source imagery, as the image characteristics of SAR and optical imagery are inherently different. However, the accuracy of flood mapping depends on the accuracy of water body delineation from single temporal imagery, which can lead to error propagation in flood extent determination. Change detection methods can extract flood extent directly from pre- and post-event imagery, but the models need to learn a consistent flood feature description between optical and SAR imagery from a limited flood dataset. Here, we propose an automatic method for flood inundation extent extraction using pre- and post-event multi-source imagery that requires only a small number of pseudo-change labels. The methodology adopts a pseudo-Siamese network framework as a Heterogeneous - Flood Inundation Extraction Network (H-FIENet), to detect flood extent between the pre‐ and post-event heterogeneous images. Spatially inconsistent multi-source pre- and post-event imagery was used to create a pseudo flood dataset, and this dataset was used to transfer water body feature knowledge from the pre-trained model to the flood extraction model using a cross-task knowledge transfer strategy. Pre- and post-event images from different satellite sources and different flood scenarios were used to evaluate the performance of H-FIENet. We found that: (1) The methodology produced an overall accuracy of over 0.94 for flood inundation extraction from multi-source heterogeneous pre- and post-event imagery. (2) H-FIENet can detect both expansion and recession of the flood extent using any dual-temporal imagery. Our work makes it possible to automate time-series flood monitoring from multi-source remote sensing imagery."

 Intensifying hydroclimatic changes in North Africa are causing unprecedented floods, droughts, and land degradation patterns that are increasingly associated with human casualties, socioeconomic instabilities, and outflow migrations. These patterns’ and their future forecasts remain largely unquantified, aggravating the impacts on several populous areas. To address this deficiency, we employ pixel-based remote sensing data correlation analysis and soil loss modeling to constrain the uncertainties on the decadal hydroclimatic and ecosystem changes in North Africa. Using cloud-based big data analysis in Google Earth Engine, we establish the convolution between precipitation patterns and surface textural characteristics, evaluating the spatial distribution of soil erosion risks at the continental scale. Our investigation uses a multi-step approach, integrating risk areas derived from soil erosion with high-resolution population data, offering critical insights into zones of different vulnerabilities. Our results unveiled a significant escalation in soil erosion anomalies over the past two decades. In particular, 15 % of the areas receiving precipitation in all of North Africa are currently at medium to high risk of soil erosion versus only 7 % in 2002. These risks are concentrated in urban areas, where each year, ∼29,000 people become highly vulnerable to these hazards, up from ∼22,000 in 2002. These increases are primarily associated with the surge in semi-unformal urban settings and the rise in rain aggressiveness and storminess. These factors, combined with the poor public perception of the imminence of these risks, create hotspots where the impacts are becoming insurmountable, as considered herein for the case of the recent catastrophic floods in Derna, Libya, used as a validation site. We conclude that increased soil erosion will modulate the impacts of upcoming catastrophic floods. As such, a pressing change in urban and land use policies in expansive areas of North Africa is called for to increase their resilience to upcoming hydroclimatic fluctuations."

 High spatial resolution XCO2 data is key to investigating the mechanisms of carbon sources and sinks. However, current carbon satellites have a narrow swath and uneven observation points, making it difficult to obtain seamless and full-coverage data. We propose a novel method combining extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) with particle swarm optimization (PSO) to construct the relationship between OCO-2 XCO2 data and auxiliary data (i.e., vegetation, meteorological, anthropogenic emissions, and LST data), and to map the seamless monthly XCO2 concentration in East Asia from 2015 to 2020. Validation results based on TCCON ground station data demonstrate the high accuracy of the model with an average R2 of 0.93, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.33 and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.24 % in five sites. The results show that the average atmospheric XCO2 concentration in East Asia shows a continuous increasing trend from 2015 to 2020, with an average annual growth rate of 2.21 ppm/yr. This trend is accompanied by clear seasonal variations, with the highest XCO2 concentration in winter and the lowest in summer. Additionally, anthropogenic activities contributed significantly to XCO2 concentrations, which were higher in urban areas. These findings highlight the dynamics of regional XCO2 concentrations over time and their association with human activities. This study provides a detailed examination of XCO2 distribution and trends in East Asia, enhancing our comprehension of atmospheric CO2 dynamics."

Building on the landmark LINCS library of transcriptional signatures of drug-like molecules and gene knockdowns, ceSAR combines cheminformatic techniques with signature concordance analysis to connect small molecules and their targets and further assess their biophysical compatibility using molecular docking. Candidate compounds are first ranked in a target structure–independent manner, using chemical similarity to LINCS analogs that exhibit transcriptomic concordance with a target gene knockdown. Top candidates are subsequently rescored using docking simulations and machine learning–based consensus of the two approaches. Using extensive benchmarking, we show that ceSAR greatly reduces false-positive rates, while cutting run times by multiple orders of magnitude and further democratizing drug discovery pipelines. We further demonstrate the utility of ceSAR by identifying and experimentally validating inhibitors of BCL2A1, an important antiapoptotic target in melanoma and preterm birth–associated inflammation."
