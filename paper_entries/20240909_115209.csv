10.1088/1748-9326/ad7307,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要研究了未来气候变化对欧亚大陆冬季降温趋势和极寒事件的影响。研究使用了第六阶段耦合模式比较计划（CMIP6）的多模式预测数据，分析了不同排放情景下2015-2100年期间欧亚大陆冬季降温趋势和极寒事件的变化。论文发现，长期来看，随着温室气体浓度的增加，欧亚大陆降温趋势的概率会降低；但短期来看，欧亚大陆降温事件受排放情景的影响较小，主要受内部变率的影响。论文还分析了不同排放情景下极寒事件的频率和强度变化，并探讨了内部变率对欧亚大陆降温趋势和极寒事件的影响。总的来说，这篇论文主要关注气候变化对欧亚大陆冬季温度的影响，没有直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析。,"['climate change', 'global warming', 'Eurasian cooling', 'cold extremes', 'CMIP6', 'climate models', 'emission scenarios']",Xinping Xu;Shengping He;Botao Zhou;Bo Sun,CMIP6 near-term and long-term projections of Eurasian winter cooling trend and cold extremes,"It is well-known that climate warming increases air temperature and reduces cold extremes in the long-term. But internal variability strongly modulates the variability of temperature at mid- and- high latitudes, for example, causing the remarkable cooling and severe winter weather over Eurasia from the 1990s to the early 2010s. It remains unclear whether the occurrence of Eurasian cooling and cold extremes will be offset by climate warming or stimulated by internal variability in the future. Based on the Sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project multi-model projections for 2015–2100, this study shows that the projected probability of Eurasian cooling trend decreases with increasing greenhouse gas concentration in the long-term (i.e. 2070–2099) from 14.8% under SSP126 to 0.9% under SSP585. In the near-term (i.e. 2021–2050), however, Eurasian cooling occurrences are less influenced by different emission scenarios. Coinciding with deep Arctic warming throughout the troposphere, the projected significant Eurasian cooling exhibits similar pattern and intensity among different scenarios. The similar trend towards tropospheric anticyclone over the Arctic among different scenarios in the near-term promotes the deep Arctic warming-Eurasian cooling trend through transporting warm (cold) air into the Arctic (mid-latitudes). Moreover, winter extreme cold anomalies (i.e. −3.0–−2.0 °C) and extreme cold days (i.e. 4–6 d) over the Eurasian continent are not sensitive to emission scenarios in the near-term. In the long-term, the accelerating climate warming under high-emission scenarios significantly reduces the frequency and intensity of Eurasian cold extremes compared to low-emission scenarios. Therefore, the occurrence of Eurasian cooling trend and cold extremes in the near-term will be dominated by internal influences (e.g. Ural blocking) and will rely more on the internal variability after the mid-century if carbon neutrality goal is achieved."
10.5194/amt-17-5261-2024,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,这篇论文研究了利用TROPOMI卫星数据估算中东地区甲烷排放量的潜力。研究人员开发了一种新的发散方法，并将其应用于2018年至2021年期间的中东地区甲烷排放量估算。该方法考虑了中东地区复杂的地形和表面反照率，并排除了数据处理过程中产生的伪像。研究结果表明，TROPOMI卫星数据可以用于量化各种来源的甲烷排放量，包括城市、石油/天然气生产区和工业区。研究还发现，一些现有的甲烷排放清单可能低估了中东地区某些地区的甲烷排放量。,"['methane emissions', 'TROPOMI', 'satellite observations', 'divergence method', 'Middle East']",Mengyao Liu;Ronald van der A;Michiel van Weele;Lotte Bryan;Henk Eskes;Pepijn Veefkind;Yongxue Liu;Xiaojuan Lin;Jos de Laat;Jieying Ding,Current potential of CH4 emission estimates using TROPOMI in the Middle East,"A new divergence method was developed and applied to estimate methane emissions from TROPOMI observations over the Middle East, where it is typically challenging for a satellite to measure methane due to its complicated orography and surface albedo. Our results show the potential of TROPOMI to quantify methane emissions from various sources rather than big emitters from space after objectively excluding the artifacts in the retrieval. 
 An improved divergence method has been developed to estimate annual methane (CH4) emissions from TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) observations. It has been applied to the period of 2018 to 2021 over the Middle East, where the orography is complicated, and the mean mixing ratio of methane (XCH4) might be affected by albedos or aerosols over some locations. To adapt to extreme changes of terrain over mountains or coasts, winds are used with their divergent part removed. A temporal filter is introduced to identify highly variable emissions and to further exclude fake sources caused by retrieval artifacts. We compare our results to widely used bottom-up anthropogenic emission inventories: Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR), Community Emissions Data System (CEDS), and Global Fuel Exploitation Inventory (GFEI) over several regions representing various types of sources. The NOx emissions are from EDGAR and Daily Emissions Constrained by Satellite Observations (DECSO), and the industrial heat sources identified by Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) are further used to better understand our resulting methane emissions. Our results indicate possibly large underestimations of methane emissions in metropolises like Tehran (up to 50 %) and Isfahan (up to 70 %) in Iran. The derived annual methane emissions from oil/gas production near the Caspian Sea in Turkmenistan are comparable to GFEI but more than 2 times higher than EDGAR and CEDS in 2019. Large discrepancies in the distribution of methane sources in Riyadh and its surrounding areas are found between EDGAR, CEDS, GFEI, and our emissions. The methane emission from oil/gas production to the east of Riyadh seems to be largely overestimated by EDGAR and CEDS, while our estimates as well as GFEI and DECSO NOx indicate much lower emissions from industrial activities. On the other hand, regions like Iran, Iraq, and Oman are dominated by sources from oil and gas exploitation that probably include more irregular releases of methane, with the result that our estimates, which include only invariable sources, are lower than the bottom-up emission inventories."

Here, we model the postseismic deformation in the first 4 years following the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake, and probe the laterally variable lower‐crustal viscosity and fault afterslip, using a combined model incorporating afterslip and viscoelastic relaxation. Modeling results reveal that laterally variable low‐viscosity zones (1017∼1018 Pa·s) beneath the Coso Volcanic Field are required to explain the observations well. These low‐viscosity materials may reduce the width of the brittle part of the fault, thus affecting the northwestward propagation of the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake rupture and the spatial pattern of nearby seismicity. Numerical simulations reveal that the postseismic viscoelastic relaxation of the event will cause contractional strain in the upper‐crustal magma reservoirs, which may counteract the extensional strain caused by the coseismic rupture."

D’Asaro,Rapid Downwelling of Tracer Particles Across the Boundary Layer and Into the Pycnocline at Submesoscale Ocean Fronts,"A neutrally buoyant float deployed in an atmospherically driven turbulent ocean boundary layer on the dense side of a submesoscale front was repeatedly carried across the boundary layer by the turbulence and then trapped beneath the slumping front. Lagrangian particles in a large‐eddy simulation of a similar baroclinically unstable front forced by surface cooling move along convergent surface filaments toward filament junctions. They are also caught by convective plumes that downwell them at speeds similar to those of the float. Subsequently, some are trapped in the pycnocline by frontal slumping due to ageostrophic secondary frontal circulations. In both observations and simulations, boundary layer turbulence and frontal circulations work together to trap and subduct particles from the mixed layer. The small‐scale boundary layer motions move them vertically within the boundary layer and larger, submesoscale frontal circulations move them laterally out of the boundary layer and under the slumping fronts."

Martin;Georgy E. Manucharyan;Patrice Klein,Deep Learning Improves Global Satellite Observations of Ocean Eddy Dynamics,"Ocean eddies affect large‐scale circulation and induce a kinetic energy cascade through their non‐linear interactions. However, since global observations of eddy dynamics come from satellite altimetry maps that smooth eddies and distort their geometry, the strength of this cascade is underestimated. Here, we use deep learning to improve observational estimates of global surface geostrophic currents and explore the implications for the cascade. By synthesizing multi‐modal satellite observations of sea surface height (SSH) and temperature, we achieve up to a 30% improvement in spatial resolution over the community‐standard SSH product. This reveals numerous strongly interacting eddies that were previously obscured by smoothing. In many regions, these newly resolved eddies lead to nearly an order‐of‐magnitude increase in the upscale kinetic energy cascade that peaks in spring and is strong enough to drive the seasonality of large mesoscale eddies. Our study suggests that deep learning can be a powerful paradigm for satellite oceanography."

Thomas,Earth's Mesosphere During Possible Encounters With Massive Interstellar Clouds 2 and 7 Million Years Ago,"Our solar system's path has recently been shown to potentially intersect dense interstellar clouds 2 and 7 million years ago: the Local Lynx of Cold Cloud and the edge of the Local Bubble. These clouds compressed the heliosphere, directly exposing Earth to the interstellar medium. Previous studies that examined climate effects of these encounters argued for an induced ice age due to the formation of global noctilucent clouds (NLCs). Here, we revisit such studies with a modern 2D atmospheric chemistry model using parameters of global heliospheric magnetohydrodynamic models as input. We show that NLCs remain confined to polar latitudes and short seasonal lifetimes during these dense cloud crossings lasting ∼105 years. Polar mesospheric ozone becomes significantly depleted, but the total ozone column broadly increases. Furthermore, we show that the densest NLCs lessen the amount of sunlight reaching the surface instantaneously by up to 7% while halving outgoing longwave radiation."

Space instruments have observed TGFs with source photon brightness down to ∼1017–1016. Based on space and aircraft observations, TGFs have been considered rare phenomena produced in association with very few lightning discharges. Space observations associated with lightning ground observations in the radio band have indicated that there exists a population of dimmer TGFs. Here we show observations of TGFs from aircraft altitude that were not detected by a space instrument viewing the same area. The TGFs were found through Monte Carlo modeling to be associated with 1015–1012 photons at source, which is several orders of magnitude below what can be seen from space. Our results suggest that there exists a significant population of TGFs that are too weak to be observed from space."

However, detecting continental materials within the deep Earth is challenging due to our incomplete knowledge about their physical properties at mantle conditions. We use a newly compiled mineral‐physical database coupled with thermodynamic modeling to calculate seismic velocities of the subducted continental crust (SCC) beyond 150 km. Results show that the SCC has one seismically detectable window depth (300–390 km) with ∼4% VP anomaly. Besides, the upper crust has another two window depths (<250 km and 610–660 km) with anomalies of −6.4%–−1.6% and −7.6%–−2.2%, and 3.6%–7.9% and 3.9%–8.6% for VP and VS compared to those of the ambient mantle, respectively. These predicted SCC characteristics match seismic anomalies at mantle depths and suggest subducted upper crust potentially contributing to the high‐velocity anomalies in the MTZ."

We first determined the single‐crystal elasticity of topaz, the product of sediment dehydration, at high pressures and temperatures by Brillouin scattering. Using the derived elastic parameters, we establish the velocity and density profiles of subducted sediments in the upper mantle. According to our modeling results, 8.5–17.5 vol.% sediments intruding into the upper mantle will induce a 2%–4% low‐VS anomaly at 210–260 km. Meanwhile, continuous heating will lead to the dehydration of phengite in sediments. The dehydration of this amount sediments can generate a 3%–6% ISS with negative Clapeyron slopes, satisfying the observed L‐discontinuity in northern Finland and northern America without the anisotropy changes but accompanied by low‐velocity anomalies. Our study thus provides new insights into the origin of the L‐discontinuity."

This study evaluated trends in meteorological drought and pluvial extremes by merging tree‐ring reconstructions, observations, and climate‐model simulations spanning 850–2100 CE across North America to determine whether modern and projected future precipitation lies outside the range of natural climate variability. Our results found widespread and spatially consistent exacerbation of drought and pluvial extremes, especially summer drought and winter pluvials, with drying in the west and south, wetting trends in the northeast, and intensification of both extremes across the east and north. Our study suggests that climate change has already shifted precipitation climatology beyond pre‐Industrial climatology and is projected to further intensify ongoing shifts."

These two CPM simulations along with a 4‐km simulation covering South America produced by National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), three gridded precipitation products, and rain gauge data in Peru and Brazil, are used to document the characteristics of precipitation and mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) in the Peruvian central Andes region. Results show that all km‐scale simulations generally capture the spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation and MCSs at both seasonal and diurnal scales, although biases exist in aspects such as precipitation intensity and MCS frequency, size, propagation speed, and associated precipitation intensity. The 3‐km simulation using MYNN scheme generally outperforms the other simulations in capturing seasonal and diurnal precipitation over the mountain, while both it and the 4‐km simulation demonstrate superior performance in the western Amazon Basin, based on the comparison to the gridded precipitation products and gauge data. Dynamic factors, primarily low‐level jet and terrain‐induced uplift, are the key drivers for precipitation and MCS genesis along the east slope of the Andes, while thermodynamic factors control the precipitation and MCS activity in the western Amazon Basin and over elevated mountainous regions.

This study used the IBIS‐CH4 (Integrated BIosphere Simulator‐Methane) model, a process‐based model integrating microbial mechanisms associated with CH4 production and oxidation processes, to simulate global wetland CH4 emissions from 2001 to 2020. Initially, we employed the IBIS‐CH4 model to evaluate its performance across 26 diverse wetland sites worldwide. The results showed that the magnitude and seasonality of observed CH4 fluxes over various wetland sites were well reproduced. We then used this model to estimate the annual global wetland CH4 emissions from 2001 to 2020, averaging 152.67 Tg CH4 yr−1, with a range of 135.72–167.57 Tg CH4 yr−1. The estimated global wetland CH4 emissions are generally in agreement with the current bottom‐up estimates (117–256 Tg CH4 yr−1) and closely overlap with independent top‐down estimates (139–183 Tg CH4 yr−1). During 2001–2020, the estimated global wetland CH4 emissions initially showed an increasing trend, followed by a decline. The peak of CH4 emissions reached in 2010, coinciding with the peak of wetland area. The majority of global wetland CH4 emissions were concentrated in tropical regions, which exhibited a clear seasonality and had a peak in July. The impact of meteorological factors on wetland CH4 emissions was greater than that of leaf area index, indicating the importance of soil hydrothermal conditions on wetland CH4 emissions."

 The 5´–3´ exoribonuclease Rat1/Xrn2 is responsible for the termination of eukaryotic mRNA transcription by RNAPII. Rat1 forms a complex with its partner proteins, Rai1 and Rtt103, and acts as a “torpedo” to bind transcribing RNAPII and dissociate DNA/RNA from it. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of the Rat1-Rai1-Rtt103 complex and three Rat1-Rai1-associated RNAPII complexes (type-1, type-1b, and type-2) from the yeast, Komagataella phaffii. The Rat1-Rai1-Rtt103 structure revealed that Rat1 and Rai1 form a heterotetramer with a single Rtt103 bound between two Rai1 molecules. In the type-1 complex, Rat1-Rai1 forms a heterodimer and binds to the RNA exit site of RNAPII to extract RNA into the Rat1 exonuclease active site. This interaction changes the RNA path in favor of termination (the “pre-termination” state). The type-1b and type-2 complexes have no bound DNA/RNA, likely representing the “post-termination” states. These structures illustrate the termination mechanism of eukaryotic mRNA transcription. The Rat1 RNase helps terminate eukaryotic mRNA transcription.

Here, the authors develop a top-down membrane self-assembly strategy to develop stem cell-derived artificial organelles (SAOs) that mimic mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation without the risks associated with stem cell therapy. 
 Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in the mitochondrial inner membrane is a therapeutic target in many diseases. Neural stem cells (NSCs) show progress in improving mitochondrial dysfunction in the central nervous system (CNS). However, translating neural stem cell-based therapies to the clinic is challenged by uncontrollable biological variability or heterogeneity, hindering uniform clinical safety and efficacy evaluations. We propose a systematic top-down design based on membrane self-assembly to develop neural stem cell-derived oxidative phosphorylating artificial organelles (SAOs) for targeting the central nervous system as an alternative to NSCs. We construct human conditionally immortal clone neural stem cells (iNSCs) as parent cells and use a streamlined closed operation system to prepare neural stem cell-derived highly homogenous oxidative phosphorylating artificial organelles. These artificial organelles act as biomimetic organelles to mimic respiration chain function and perform oxidative phosphorylation, thus improving ATP synthesis deficiency and rectifying excessive mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production. Conclusively, we provide a framework for a generalizable manufacturing procedure that opens promising prospects for disease treatment.

 Metal hydrides are crucial intermediates in numerous catalytic reactions. Intensive efforts have been dedicated to constructing molecular metal hydrides, where toxic precursors and delicate mediators are usually involved. Herein, we demonstrate a facile pressure-induced methodology to generate a cost-effective heterogeneous electrocatalytic metal hydride surface for sustainable hydrogen transfer. Taking carbon dioxide (CO2) electroreduction as a model system and zinc (Zn), a well-known carbon monoxide (CO)-selective catalyst, as a model catalyst, we showcase a homogeneous-type hydrogen atom transfer process induced by heterogeneous hydride surfaces, enabling direct hydrogenation pathways traditionally considered “prohibited”. Specifically, the maximal Faradaic efficiency for formate is enhanced by ~fivefold to 83% under ambient conditions. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that unlike the distal hydrogenation route for CO2 to CO over pristine Zn, the Zn hydride surface enables direct hydrogenation at the carbon site of CO2 to form formate. This work provides a promising material platform for sustainable synthesis.

 Pompe disease (PD) is a rare autosomal recessive glycogen storage disorder that causes proximal muscle weakness and loss of respiratory function. While enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is the only effective treatment, biomarkers for disease monitoring are scarce. Following ex vivo biomarker validation in phantom studies, we apply multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT), a laser- and ultrasound-based non-invasive imaging approach, in a clinical trial (NCT05083806) to image the biceps muscles of 10 late-onset PD (LOPD) patients and 10 matched healthy controls. MSOT is compared with muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, spirometry, muscle testing and quality of life scores. Next, results are validated in an independent LOPD patient cohort from a second clinical site. Our study demonstrates that MSOT enables imaging of subcellular disease pathology with increases in glycogen/water, collagen and lipid signals, providing higher sensitivity in detecting muscle degeneration than current methods. This translational approach suggests implementation in the complex care of these rare disease patients.

 Supercapacitors are emerging as energy-efficient and robust devices for electrochemical CO2 capture. However, the impacts of electrode structure and charging protocols on CO2 capture performance remain unclear. Therefore, this study develops structure-property-performance correlations for supercapacitor electrodes at different charging conditions. We find that electrodes with large surface areas and low oxygen functionalization generally perform best, while a combination of micro- and mesopores is important to achieve fast CO2 capture rates. With these structural features and tunable charging protocols, YP80F activated carbon electrodes show the best CO2 capture performance with a capture rate of 350 mmolCO2 kg–1 h–1 and a low electrical energy consumption of 18 kJ molCO2–1 at 300 mA g–1 under CO2, together with a long lifetime over 12000 cycles at 150 mA g–1 under CO2 and excellent CO2 selectivity over N2 and O2. Operated in a “positive charging mode”, the system achieves excellent electrochemical reversibility with Coulombic efficiencies over 99.8% in the presence of approximately 15% O2, alongside stable cycling performance over 1000 cycles.

 The complex jagged trajectory of fractured surfaces of two pieces of forensic evidence is used to recognize a “match” by using comparative microscopy and tactile pattern analysis. The material intrinsic properties and microstructures, as well as the exposure history of external forces on a fragment of forensic evidence have the premise of uniqueness at a relevant microscopic length scale (about 2–3 grains for cleavage fracture), wherein the statistics of the fracture surface become non-self-affine. We utilize these unique features to quantitatively describe the microscopic aspects of fracture surfaces for forensic comparisons, employing spectral analysis of the topography mapped by three-dimensional microscopy. Multivariate statistical learning tools are used to classify articles and result in near-perfect identification of a “match” and “non-match” among candidate forensic specimens.

Regulated by CCR9/CCL25 and S1P signaling, ml-ILC2s reside in the lamina propria of small intestines (siLP) in asthma remission, and subsequently move to airway upon re-encountering antigens or alarmins. Furthermore, ml-ILC2s possess properties of longevity, potential of rapid proliferation and producing IL-13, and display transcriptional characteristics with up-regulation of Tox and Tcf-7. ml-ILC2s transplantation restore the asthmatic changes abrogated by Tox and Tcf7 knockdown.

 In eukaryotes, the leading strand DNA is synthesized by Polε and the lagging strand by Polδ. These replicative polymerases have higher processivity when paired with the DNA clamp PCNA.

Here we report two cryo-EM structures of human Polε–PCNA–DNA complex, one in an incoming nucleotide bound state and the other in a nucleotide exchange state. The structures reveal an unexpected three-point interface between the Polε catalytic domain and PCNA, with the conserved PIP (PCNA interacting peptide)-motif, the unique P-domain, and the thumb domain each interacting with a different protomer of the PCNA trimer. We propose that the multi-point interface prevents other PIP-containing factors from recruiting to PCNA while PCNA functions with Polε.

 The mid-Holocene climate optimum saw warm temperatures in large parts of China, but its impact on seasonal environmental changes is not fully understood yet. Here, we use high-resolution geochemical analyses of 7000 to 6000 year-old oyster shells from the Yangtze River Delta to reconstruct climatic and oceanographic patterns. The stable isotope (δ18O, δ13C) and clumped isotope data reflect prominent seasonal changes in temperature, precipitation, and river discharge. Summer months experienced warm temperatures and a distinct increase in rainfalls and river discharge. In contrast, winter months were characterized by a dry season, which might have been longer than today. Stable isotope data also indicate regular summer upwelling in the study area. These results partly disagree with available climate models raising doubts on the models’ reliability. Thus, our palaeo-proxy data offers the possibility to evaluate and correct climate models and thereby improve predictions for the future considering on-going global warming.

 Accurate nearshore bathymetry estimation remains a critical challenge, impacting coastal forecasting evolution assessments through the inaccuracies in both in-situ and remote sensing surveys. This article introduces the Satellite Derived Bathymetry (SDB) temporal correlation method, showcasing its ability in deriving accurate nearshore bathymetry from one minute spaceborne videos. The approach utilises correlation of pixel intensity time series, shifted in time and space, extracted from a frame stack within a defined correlation window. The resulting correlation is then projected using the Radon Transform to infer wave characteristics (celerity and wavelength) for the estimation of depth through wave linear dispersion. Moreover, the adaptation of the correlation window based on a first wavelength estimation provided a more focused assessment of the wavefield that reveals morphological features such as sandbars in the bathymetric estimation. The method’s capabilities using adapted correlation window is illustrated through its application to a metric resolution Jilin satellite video (57 s at 5 Hz) along the Saint-Louis coast in Senegal. Through this demonstration, the temporal correlation method is among the first SDB methods to successfully capture the submerged sandbar along a beach. Comparison against in-situ measurements conducted three years prior to the video acquisition shows a good agreement with a bias of 0.97 m within the initial 2 km of the cross-shore profile. Furthermore, the application of previously developed sky-glint surface elevation analysis on video pixel intensity, prior to the bathymetry estimation, significantly reduces the bias to 0.44 m in the Saint-Louis estimation.

 The vegetation dynamics in highly heterogeneous landscapes (e.g., riparian vegetation surrounding waterholes and oases) are difficult to detect from large (e.g., MODIS) and moderate (e.g., Landsat) spatial resolution remote sensing products. Within a “classify-to-monitor” approach, a method to monitor spatially heterogeneous riparian vegetation dynamics is developed by integrating high spatial resolution discrete return airborne LiDAR data (1 m pixels) with moderate resolution Landsat fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation absorbed by vegetation (fPAR) data (30 m). LiDAR was used to identify and classify vegetation surrounding permanent waterholes within the Cooper Creek floodplain, in dryland Australia. These waterholes are important areas for ecological conservation given their highly spatially heterogeneous vegetation structure. Landsat fPAR was temporally decomposed into persistent and recurrent components and then integrated with the LiDAR-derived vegetation classes. The LiDAR data were used as a mask to separate the fPAR signal of each vegetation class, capturing their specific dynamics and which fPAR component they are associated with. The newly developed method provides the means to improve the interpretation of Landsat fPAR by monitoring distinct vegetation functional groups within each Landsat pixel. Results showed that LiDAR data provided good estimates of vegetation cover compared to field measurements (R2=0.952). LiDAR data identified different vegetation structural classes within the riparian zone. The integration of LiDAR and Landsat data permitted the distinction of temporal patterns of each vegetation structural class, uncovering the specific temporal and spatial variability of fPAR that would otherwise be undetected. Landsat fPAR provided information on which vegetation component contributed to the fPAR variability in each class, thus providing the means for enhanced ecological interpretation of the temporally decomposed fPAR components. The method can be applied to other similar highly spatially heterogeneous ecosystems to monitor structurally specific vegetation dynamics more accurately than if only using moderate spatial resolution time-series optical satellite imagery."

 Accurate estimation of regional-scale evapotranspiration (ET) and reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is crucial for scientific and rational water resource management, agricultural irrigation decision-making, and ecosystem monitoring. Currently, the estimation of ETo or ET still mainly relies on observational data from surface meteorological stations or flux towers. However, due to the complexity of parameters and models, as well as the uneven distribution of observation stations, there is significant uncertainty in the estimation of ETo or ET. We have developed a semi-empirical model based on Fick's law and the optimal stomatal behavior model by combining vegetation photosynthesis indicators and meteorological parameters. We compared the potential of using solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), and the product of NIRv and photosynthetically active radiation (NIRvP) to estimate ETo and ET. The results indicate that NIRvP×VPD0.5 (the 0.5th power of vapor pressure deficit) has an advantage in estimating ETo. Additionally, in nonlinear models, the accuracy of estimating ET using NIRvP and VPD0.5 surpasses that of using SIF. We also revealed that temperature and atmospheric pressure are the main factors mediating the relationship between NIRvP×VPD0.5 and ETo, as well as between NIRvP and ET.

 Salt marshes are pivotal in the global carbon cycle, serving as significant contributors to the blue carbon sink.
