Despite its great potential, biochar production and scale use remain strikingly limited in Brazil. Here, we explored the multifaceted potential of biochar in Brazil, focusing on its capacity to promote circularity, create novel inputs for agricultural and environmental purposes, and optimize infrastructure for the production and cycling of organic residues from diverse agricultural and energy production chains. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with stakeholders, and a workshop was organized with participants representing universities, public research institutes, private companies, and non-governmental organizations. We analyzed the current Brazilian scenario, identifying the main barriers preventing the widespread use of biochar in the country, as well as possible solutions in the economic, political, technological, research and development, and innovation sectors. Based on this assessment, our results show that stakeholders view the Brazilian biochar sector as emerging but constrained by regulatory uncertainty, market fragmentation, and logistical bottlenecks. They identified five priority levers for change: the creation of clear and credible regulatory frameworks, region-specific strategies for biomass use and on-farm deployment, integration of biochar into robust carbon market mechanisms, strengthening of targeted research and demonstration projects, and development of business models that combine agricultural benefits, carbon removal, and co-products."

Carslaw,Remaining aerosol forcing uncertainty after observational constraint and the processes that cause it,"Tiny particles called aerosols affect how much sunlight the Earth reflects back into space – one of the biggest climate uncertainties. We use a large set of climate model simulations and find that uncertainty drops in some regions, but persists in other areas, after comparing models to observations. By identifying the specific processes that cause the remaining uncertainty, we guide future efforts to reduce the aerosol forcing uncertainty so we can make more reliable climate predictions. 
 Aerosol radiative forcing remains a major source of climate model uncertainty, limiting climate model projection skill and slowing global action on addressing climate risks. Observations only modestly constrain the magnitude of aerosol radiative forcing despite advances in model fidelity, resolution and availability of observations. Our goals are to understand where aerosol-cloud forcing uncertainty resists efforts to reduce (or constrain) it and to identify the processes that cause the remaining uncertainty, to guide future observation campaigns and model constraint efforts. We map the aerosol forcing uncertainty in a global climate model perturbed parameter ensemble before and after constraint to satellite observations of several cloud, aerosol and radiative properties. Original uncertainty falls by more than 80 % in Northern Hemisphere marine regions and by 70 % for globally averaged aerosol forcing. However, the uncertainty remains large (more than 70 % of the original uncertainty) in Southern Hemisphere marine environments where stratocumulus clouds transition to cumulus, as well as in some highly populated industrialized areas. Regional clusters of shared causes of model uncertainty highlight common processes as targets for future observational constraint. Our findings highlight the value in re-evaluating the remaining causes of ΔFaci uncertainty during the constraint process and provide actionable information for prioritizing existing observations that should be included as constraints. Additionally, our results highlight targeted observations in persistent uncertainty hotspots where novel and process-specific data could further constrain aerosol forcing. This work provides a framework for model evaluation and development that prioritises aerosol forcing constraint to improve model skill at making climate projections."

The results show that particles remain liquid near the Earth’s surface but become semi-solid or glassy at higher altitudes. These viscosity changes influence chemical reactions such as nitrogen oxide uptake, improving understanding of air quality and climate processes. 
 Organic aerosol (OA) viscosity and phase state govern multiphase diffusion and reactivity, yet systematic constraints across tropospheric temperature (T)–relative humidity (RH) space remain limited. We measured the viscosity of sucrose-H2O droplets (OA surrogate) over 273–303 K and ∼ 20 %–90 % RH using bead-mobility and poke-and-flow methods, with viscosity spanning ∼ 8 orders of magnitude across the investigated RH range at each temperature. A Vogel–Fulcher–Tammann fit with experimentally derived fragility (Df= 13 ± 1) extended the parameterization by ∼ 43 K beyond the measurement range, to 230–310 K and 0 %–100 % RH, with substantial uncertainty at low temperatures. When coupled with zonal-mean tropospheric T–RH fields (2020–2024), the parameterization was used to infer global distributions of viscosity and organic-phase mixing time (τmix,org) for 200 nm particles, suggesting predominantly liquid states below ∼ 2 km, semisolid regimes across ∼ 2–9 km (latitude dependent), and near-glassy conditions at higher altitudes; with τmix,org typically being < 1 h in the boundary layer but often exceeding 1 h aloft. The resulting global fields highlight the potential atmospheric implications of temperature- and RH-sensitive viscosity across the troposphere. Calculations indicated the N2O5 uptake coefficient was generally ≥ 10−2 for liquid particles in the boundary layer, decreased by ∼ 1–2 orders above ∼ 2–4 km as bulk diffusion became rate-limiting; with surface hydrolysis, N2O5 uptake coefficient leveled near ∼ 10−3.5 aloft, and without it can drop to 10−5–10−6 at viscosity 109 Pa s. These results provide evidence for the need for T- and RH-sensitive viscosity in next-generation air-quality and climate models."

Evaluations show that MLAWind achieves comparable performance to the widely-used reanalysis datasets at different time scales. It provides reliable historical wind data during both satellite and non-satellite periods, demonstrating broad application prospects in ocean and climate research. 
 A gridded sea surface wind dataset with long temporal coverage is crucial for understanding atmospheric circulation changes and air-sea interactions at different time scales. This study employs an interpretable machine learning model based on random forest algorithm to generate a 1°×1° monthly sea surface wind dataset (MLAWind) from 1950 to 2023, covering the near-global ocean within 60° S–60° N. The data reconstruction model integrates the Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform (CCMP) satellite data and the spatially sparse long-term International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS), exhibiting robust interpretability and generalization capability. Evaluations demonstrate that the MLAWind dataset exhibits better agreement with remote sensing observations than existing reanalysis datasets during the training period (1993–2022), while maintaining robust performance during the independent testing period in 2023. Moreover, the performance of MLAWind since 1950 is assessed across multiple time scales. Its characteristics in climatology, annual cycle, and inter-annual variability are comparable to those of existing reanalysis datasets, even during the non-satellite period prior to 1993. Uncertainties remain in the long-term trends of different datasets. The trend derived from MLAWind is corroborated by independent coral records during 1950–1982, which demonstrates its strong capability in reconstructing historical sea surface wind variations. The results indicate that MLAWind serves as a reliable data resource for global climate change research. The reconstructed MLAWind dataset is publicly accessible at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17354864 (Guo et al., 2025b)."

 The dataset presents a FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable), comprehensive, long-term dataset documenting maize phenology dynamics across China's Huang-Huai-Hai Region (HHHP), a critical area for national grain production.

We did this to overcome gaps and coarse resolution in existing satellite data by combining many data sources with advanced artificial intelligence. The results reveal both long-term growth and short-lived increases following events such as wildfires. This dataset supports better tracking of emissions and understanding of climate change. 
 Accurate and temporally continuous global observations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (XCO2) are essential for climate monitoring and emission assessment. However, satellite-based XCO2 observations are often spatially incomplete and temporally discontinuous, while existing products typically suffer from coarse spatial resolutions, hindering the detection of fine-scale emission changes. Here, we developed a novel spatiotemporal Transformer-BiLSTM deep-learning network, which integrates the local temporal feature extraction capability of bidirectional long short-term memory with the global spatial dependency modeling strength of Transformer via self-attention mechanisms. The network assimilates multisource data, from satellite observations, meteorological reanalysis, and precursor gases, to reconstruct global, daily, and seamless XCO2 at 0.1° resolution from 2003 to 2022. Validation against independent Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) measurements shows excellent agreement, with a correlation coefficient (R2) value of 0.99, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.10 ppm, and a mean bias of 0.01 ppm. A subsequent bias correction scheme further improves cross-satellite consistency, achieving a cross-validation coefficient of determination (CV-R2) of 0.99 and an RMSE of 0.97 ppm. Our dataset enables accurate characterization of daily XCO2 concentrations over global land surfaces, facilitating the detection of spatial heterogeneity associated with emission hotspots and point-source activities. The record reveals a persistent global increase in atmospheric XCO2 over the past two decades, with a mean growth rate of 2.24 ppm/yr (p < 0.001). It reliably resolves global XCO2 variability across a wide range of temporal scales, from day-to-day fluctuations to long-term trends. It consistently captures large-scale climate-driven signals, such as ENSO-related interannual variability, and short-lived XCO2 enhancements associated with major wildfire events, demonstrating its capability to represent both persistent and episodic emission signals. This high-resolution, daily global XCO2 product (GlobalHighXCO2) provides a valuable benchmark for carbon cycle studies, atmospheric model evaluation, and emission monitoring, and is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18220961 (Qu and Wei, 2026)."

Sensitivity experiments with the LMDz model assess how uncertainties in emissions, isotopic signatures, OH sinks, and kinetic isotope effects influence atmospheric δ13C-CH4 and CH4, providing guidance for isotopic inversions. 
 The isotopic composition of atmospheric methane (δ13C-CH4) provides critical constraints for attributing methane emissions to specific sources. In this study, we present updated global maps of δ13C-CH4 source signatures across five major methane-emitting sectors (fossil fuels and geological, agriculture and waste, biomass and biofuel burning, wetlands, and other natural sources) for the period 1998–2022. These maps integrate recent spatially explicit datasets and literature-derived observations, and include explicit quantification of both intrinsic (within-sector) and aggregation-related uncertainties. Building upon previous global compilations, our dataset extends the temporal coverage to 2022, harmonizes sectoral definitions with the Global Methane Budget framework, and provides a consistent and traceable quantification of uncertainties suitable for atmospheric inversions. We assess the influence of these updated source signatures on the modeled atmospheric δ13C-CH4 using forward simulations within the Community Inversion Framework (CIF) coupled to the LMDz transport model. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis quantifies the impacts of key drivers of uncertainty, including emission flux datasets, OH sinks, kinetic isotope effects, and isotopic source signatures. We show that uncertainties in methane oxidation chemistry and source signatures, particularly from agriculture and waste, dominate the variability in the modeled δ13C-CH4 signal, while the impact of flux aggregation choices is comparatively minor. The updated isotopic dataset is provided on a global 1° × 1° grid, supporting future atmospheric inversions and improved methane budget assessments at global and regional scales. Practical guidelines for configuring isotopic inversions, including recommended uncertainty specifications and key parameters to optimize, are also provided, offering a framework for next-generation δ13C-CH4 inversion studies.

The dataset is produced using a fully independent data-processing framework and is based on measurements from at least two satellites operating at the same time each month. Comparisons with existing global datasets and coastal measurements show close agreement in long-term sea level rise, while also revealing differences in regions with strong ocean variability. 
 Long-term and spatially consistent sea-level anomaly (SLA) products derived from satellite altimetry are fundamental for sea-level and climate change studies. In this study, we develop the PolyU2025 SLA (The Hong Kong Polytechnic University 2025 sea level anomaly), a new global monthly gridded SLA product generated using a fully independent data-processing framework. This product is provided on a regular 0.25° × 0.25° grid and spans the period from January 1993 to December 2024 and is intended to be updated regularly. The PolyU2025 SLA is evaluated through systematic intercomparisons with the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) gridded SLA product as well as with independent tide-gauge observations. The results demonstrate a high level of consistency between PolyU2025 and C3S at global and basin scales, characterized by near-zero differences in global-mean SLA and statistically indistinguishable estimates of global mean sea level trends and accelerations, confirming that both products are suitable for climate-scale applications. At regional and short time scales, differences between the two products become more pronounced, particularly in dynamically active regions, and are mainly associated with differences in the representation of short-term and mesoscale variability. These differences reflect methodological trade-offs in data processing and spatial mapping rather than systematic biases. Overall, the PolyU2025 SLA provides a stable and consistent characterization of sea-level change from regional to global scales and serves as a complementary dataset to existing gridded SLA products, especially for long-term and climate-oriented sea-level studies and multi-product assessments of regional sea-level variability and uncertainty.

However, few account for the storage, fate, and transport of sediment properties, such as lithology or geochemistry. We present new Landlab model components that track such properties. Our unit-agnostic approach allows users to define the sediment properties for a wide range of applications (for example, mass of magnetite, volume of quartz, number of zircons, number of 10Be atoms, equivalent dose of luminescence). 
 We present a set of new Landlab numerical model components that allow users to track sediment properties across a landscape grid. The components use a mass-balance approach to partition the mass concentration of each property based on sediment fluxes calculated by various Landlab flux components. The methods are generic, allowing the user to assign any sediment property that can be expressed as a mass, volume, or number concentration (for example, mass of magnetite, volume of quartz, number of zircons, number of radiogenic 10Be atoms, “equivalent dose” of luminescence). Several properties can be tracked at once, each with concentration tracked in both sediment and bedrock at every location on the grid. Two ConcentrationTracker components have been formulated; one for distributed, space- and time-varying hillslope regolith movement and another for transport in fluvial networks, allowing for interaction between sediment in the water column and on the channel bed. These components can be used individually to study a single process or coupled to study the interactions of multiple processes acting on a dynamic landscape. We present two examples that illustrate the diverse uses of the ConcentrationTracker components: colour banding in hillslope regolith and provenance tracking of fluvial sediments."

Here, we combine a 13 year field trial with graded straw biochar applications (0–22.5 t ha–1 season–1) and a 60 day anaerobic incubation of year-13 soils to investigate how mineral and microbial processes regulate soil organic carbon (SOC), phosphorus (P), and methane (CH4) dynamics. Long-term biochar progressively depleted Fe oxides and enriched Ca phases, promoting the formation of Ca-bridged OC-mineral-P complexes that costabilize OC and P. Under prolonged anoxia, soils amended with high rates of biochar exhibited 2.5–3.2-fold slower Fe(III) reduction and delayed sulfate reduction, resulting in 53–80% lower CH4 emissions and 60–71% P release relative to the no-biochar control. Nanoscale imaging and microbial profiling corroborated this mineral transition, showing a shift toward redox-resilient organo-mineral complexes and microbial communities associated with suppressed methanogenesis and enhanced nutrient retention. These findings provide long-term field-based evidence that biochar can simultaneously sustain crop productivity, enhance C and P retention, and mitigate CH4 emissions in flooded rice agroecosystems. Our findings highlight biochar’s potential as a scalable nature-based strategy for integrating nutrient management with climate mitigation in global rice production."

This paper reported for the first time the impact of hydraulic pressure on hollow fiber (HF) layer-by-layer (LBL) nanofiltration (NF) membranes. The evolution of microdeformation and consequent performance degradation of LBL HF membranes was analyzed by focusing on the Young’s modulus of the substrate. Irreversible radial compaction and circumferential expansion under high pressure in a poly(ether sulfone) (PES) substrate were observed in the membrane morphology and performance changes. The lower the substrate Young’s modulus, the more pronounced the deformation at the same operating pressure and the lower the critical pressure at which performance begins to deteriorate. In responding to the deformation of the substrate, we propose a compaction–expansion model where the LBL skin layer imbedded into the substrate pore exhibits a three-stage response: (1) compaction, (2) limited stretching, and (3) significant stretching. Beyond stage (3), when stress was released, the decreased separation performance was irreversible. The experimental observations and modeling provided a physical origin of the performance degradation of the LBL NF membranes at high pressure. This work offered valuable practical and theoretical insights for the development of highly mechanically stable LBL HF membranes."

In urban areas, the complex emission patterns of VOCs─driven by diverse anthropogenic activities─present major challenges for accurate source characterization and quantification. In this study, we conducted eddy covariance flux measurements of VOC in a Chinese megacity to elucidate strengths and origins of VOC in urban region. The results revealed pronounced temporal and compositional differences between VOC fluxes and concentrations. By linking compositional differences between VOC fluxes (fresh emissions) and concentrations (chemically processed air), we provide direct evidence of the critical role of the chemical evolution in shaping atmospheric compositions of VOCs in urban air. We demonstrate the advantages of using flux data in source apportionment for emissions by comparing positive matrix factorization (PMF) analyses based on flux and concentration data sets. Flux-based source apportionment revealed that urban VOC tracers, such as toluene, are primarily associated with volatile chemical product (VCP) rather than traffic. The temperature-driven dynamics of biogenic and anthropogenic (average: 53% vs 47%) contributions to the total monoterpene fluxes are quantified, highlighting the shifting importance of anthropogenic and biogenic sources in urban environments.

Yet, the mechanisms governing their biodegradation, especially the role of redox transitions in mediating biotransformation, remain insufficiently understood. Here, we integrate metagenomic profiling with chemical analytics in a 10 m simulated riverbank filtration system to demonstrate how sequential oxidizing–reducing degradation enhances organic micropollutant transformation. Oxygen stratification structured distinct microbial and enzymatic pathways: oxidizing zones (>+200 mV redox potential) facilitated cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation (oxidizing condition, OXD), while subsequent redox shifts to reducing conditions (←400 mV, sequential oxidizing–reducing (SOR) conditions) activated reductive transformations (e.g., via nitronate monooxygenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase) and conjugation pathways. These SOR conditions significantly enhanced the removal of recalcitrant compounds, including irbesartan (+25.3%), benzotriazole (13.4%), and gabapentin (+9.7%). Metagenomic analysis revealed redox-driven microbial specialization, with Pseudomonadota and Nitrospirota dominating in oxidizing zones and reducing microzones enriched in pathways associated with nitrotoluene and ethylbenzene degradation, providing genomic evidence for sequential organic micropollutant breakdown. These findings establish a mechanistic framework for harnessing oxidizing–reducing microbial partnerships to amplify organic micropollutant removal in nature-based water treatment systems, which can be used for riverbank filtration site selection and well field construction and optimization."

In order to rigorously statistically compare the methods, four metrics were used: accuracy, consistency, diversity, and congruency. A novel integrative statistical approach for conducting methodological comparisons was conducted by utilizing the four metrics. By conducting a thorough statistical analysis, a variety of novel insights are highlighted. Specifically, hoop netting was accurate when compared to seine netting and gill netting, COI was accurate when compared to seine netting, seine netting was consistent with COI and hoop netting, eDNA (COI + 12S) found higher levels of species richness, and COI was congruent with four conventional methods. When the specific results are synthesized, three main findings were discovered: (1) COI outperformed 12S on three out of the four metrics, (2) seine netting is largely redundant in the presence of COI, and (3) eDNA captures a more complete picture of biodiversity and is best compared to a combination of conventional methods; however, in order to accomplish this, multiple markers need to be utilized (12S + COI). However, the findings also raise concerns with respect to the validity and accuracy of 12S results, suggest that a combination of methods need to be utilized in the majority of situations, and question the overall reliability of eDNA metabarcoding. Ultimately, we recommend that researchers conduct rigorous statistical analyses, moving beyond superficial comparisons, to develop numerical evidence to support and strengthen their conclusions."

However, relevant kinetic parameters remain scarce, particularly in aerosol liquid water (ALW), where high concentrations of inorganic ions coexist. In this study, we developed a predictive model to estimate the aqueous-phase reaction rate constants between NO3 and organic compounds (kNO3) using a novel machine learning (ML)-based approach. By simultaneously considering the chemical properties of the reactants and experimental conditions, this model enables an accurate prediction of kNO3 across ionic strength (I) ranges of 0–6 M, while also accounting for the influence of different ionic species. The model’s predictive accuracy, generalization ability, and applicability domain (AD) are evaluated, followed by a mechanistic interpretation via Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis. In summary, this study provides a valuable supplementary tool for estimating kinetic parameters in both cloud droplets and ALW. As an application, the model is employed to predict kNO3 values for phenolic compounds emitted from biomass burning (BB), extending the currently available data set for atmospheric modeling."

While life cycle assessment (LCA) is widely adopted, methodological inconsistencies across studies have limited the comparability and reliability of results. This study addresses this gap by systematically reducing variability in published LCA estimates, providing a harmonized baseline for the environmental performance of biosolids processing technologies. The study adopted a harmonization approach to align methodological choices across 19 LCA studies covering four biosolid processing systems. Harmonisation significantly reduced variability and clarified comparative environmental outcomes: anaerobic digestion had the lowest mean harmonized global warming potential, while incineration and composting remained the highest-impact systems. Pyrolysis presented the widest postharmonization range, reflecting ongoing uncertainties and technological heterogeneity. A biosolids LCA benchmarking tool was also proposed to enable the development of customized harmonization results based on site-specific conditions. Moreover, a novel approach, partial harmonization, was introduced to serve as a sensitivity analysis that isolates the influence of individual LCA inputs to identify key sources of variation. Among 92 LCA inputs, this method identified inputs such as electricity mix, system boundaries for energy recovery, and fertilizer substitution assumptions as dominant drivers of variability."

Substituting hazardous pesticides with less impactful alternatives comes with challenges related to systematically matching crops, pests, and pesticides, considering regulations, equal efficacy, and combining pesticides to collectively control a wider set of pests across critical crop stages. We propose a quantitative framework to define and assess functionally equivalent scenarios for substituting hazardous pesticides in real-life agricultural applications to reduce human and ecosystem health impacts. Testing our framework on pesticide use in Thailand highlights that particularly hazardous pesticides are applied to certain crops (e.g., tomato, Brassica vegetables) and pests (e.g., tomato leaf miner flies, different thrips species). We found that the number of scenarios combining different pesticides is not an indicator of the variability in scenario impacts: some crop–pest class (e.g., insects) pairs with >10,000 possible scenarios of pesticide combinations vary less in impact performance than some pairs with fewer scenarios. For each crop–pest class pair, we recommend the 10% best-in-class impact performance scenarios for substituting more hazardous scenarios. Our framework can inform policymakers to identify hazardous pesticides for phase out, support ambitions of UNEP’s Global Framework on Chemicals, and aid farmers to reduce their pesticide-related chemical footprint."

Here we introduce a nanoconfinement-assisted EO strategy using TiO2 nanotube (NT) anodes that overcomes these challenges. Compared with TiO2 film and nanoparticle electrodes, the TiO2 NT system achieved 95.6% phenol removal (vs 61.3% and 78.1%), a 3-fold higher degradation rate constant, 71.9% mineralization efficiency (vs 10.8% and 17.9%), and ∼80% lower chlorinated byproduct conversion. Six representative pharmaceutical and personal care products were removed by >90% with concurrent toxicity reduction. Mechanistic investigations combined with density functional theory revealed that spatial confinement enriches pollutants and reactive species at the electrode interface, strengthening direct electron transfer (DET) and indirect direct electron transfer (IDET). More importantly, confinement promoted radical–radical cross-coupling, establishing a synergistic pathway between DET and IDET with the lowest thermodynamic barrier, driving deep mineralization while minimizing chlorination. The nanoconfinement-assisted EO system further demonstrated efficient pollutant removal, toxicity control, and long-term stability in treating biologically treated coking wastewater. These findings highlight nanoconfinement as a powerful design principle for advancing EO toward practical saline wastewater treatment."

To address this gap, we developed a Suspect List-Guided High-Throughput Screening strategy that integrates literature-informed suspect list construction with developmental trend-guided, stage-resolved end points evaluation to identify environmental substances associated with advanced embryonic developmental timing across a broad chemical space. By retrospectively screening over 9,300 toxicity records from public repositories, we curated a suspect list of 46 substances linked to affect developmental timing-related end points. Experimental validation in zebrafish confirmed that 27 compounds (58.7%) significantly affected at least one stage-resolved morphological end point, including epiboly progression, somite formation, and/or yolk sac dynamics. Notable, the sulfonamide antibiotics sulfadiazine (SDZ) and sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) exhibited pronounced effects at environmentally relevant concentrations (from ng/L to low μg/L). Exploratory transcriptomic analyses further revealed coordinated pathway-level responses related to neuromuscular and cardiovascular development, supporting a shift in overall developmental timing rather than overt toxicity. Furthermore, eight additional sulfonamides produced comparable effects, suggesting a potential class-wide phenomenon. Together, our integrated approach identified a set of environmental substances associated with advanced embryonic developmental timing at environmentally relevant levels and highlighted their potential ecological relevance."

Here, 119 textile products from Chinese online vendors were analyzed for traditional and emerging QACs using target and suspect screening approaches with high-resolution mass spectrometry. The total concentrations of 18 traditional QACs ranged from 7.34 to 145,000 ng/g, and 16 emerging QACs were identified with total concentrations at 5.45 to 349,000 ng/g. Under laboratory-controlled conditions, over 76% of the selected textiles exhibited QAC migration rates exceeding 50% after washing. In simulated laundry experiments, hand-washing released a ΣQAC concentration of 42.1 ng/mL, and machine-washing released 22.4 ng/mL, with differences attributed to the water volume used by different methods. Both laundry wastewater and QACs solution at equivalent concentrations caused dose-dependent immobilization of Daphnia magna. Combining bioassay-based risk characterization factors with environmental dilution factors across 150 countries, 7% of regions showed high risk after WWTP-treatment, increasing to 41% for direct discharge with sewage. The high migration rates suggest that QAC-treated textiles not only fail to maintain long-term antimicrobial efficacy but also contribute to continuous low-level environmental exposures, raising concerns about their essential use in nondisposable textile materials."

However, the coexisting organics in high-salinity wastewater raise concerns regarding their potential adverse impacts on NF membrane salt separation performance. Herein, we investigated this long-overlooked phenomenon and its underlying mechanisms by focusing on Cl–/SO42– separation in an actual reverse-osmosis concentrate treatment. The results demonstrated that the coexisting organics compromised the Cl–/SO42– separation factor from 100–150 to 20–40. Static adsorption experiments revealed that organic adsorption is governed by electrostatic interactions in low-salinity solutions but dominated by nonelectrostatic interactions due to the enhanced charge-shielding and salting-out effects in high-salinity solutions. Consequently, organic adsorption not solely is limited to positively charged organics but also involves neutral and negatively charged organics, with the adsorption amount increasing with the hydrophobicity of the organic compounds and the membrane. Performance characterization revealed that organic adsorption induced the attenuation of the membrane surface negative charge density and increased the molecular weight cutoff, thereby weakening the steric, Donnan, and dielectric exclusion. This study yields critical insights into strategies for enhancing salt separation performance, optimizing NF process design, and elevating the economic viability of ZLD systems in industrial practice."

In this study, 800-day microcosm experiments were performed with PE samples retrieved from an active landfill site with distinct landfill durations. Results demonstrated that anaerobic microbes slowly degrade PE while enhancing the release of secondary pollutants, such as nanoplastics (NPs) and phthalate esters (PAEs). Microbial colonization increased the surface roughness of PE samples and the abundance of oxygenated functional groups, driving oxidative chain scission, NP release (2.4–4.3 × 1011 particles mL–1 leachate), and PAE biodegradation. Logarithmic curves derived from an improved Polymer Aging Index revealed a midage acceleration window, with PE buried for 7 years being the most susceptible to microbial attack. PE-associated microbial communities were dominated by deterministic assembly processes, with functional taxa being the dominant drivers of PE aging, and PAE degraders exhibiting dual-threshold dynamics. Together, this study identifies a coupled oxidation-biodegradation-fragmentation feedbacks mechanism that governs the fate of PE in landfills, highlighting the dual microbial role in degrading PE and amplifying associated pollutant release."

Most aerosol sampling methods are believed to contribute to virus inactivation, but the magnitude of this sampling artifact is unknown. To investigate this question, we aerosolized influenza A virus (IAV) and SARS-CoV-2 suspended in human saliva into a small chamber (3.7 L). Aerosols settled for 10 min onto either cells or a thin layer of liquid medium that was immediately transferred to cells for plaque assay. Aerosols that deposited directly onto cells led to the formation of 100× more plaque forming units (PFU) compared to aerosols that deposited first into liquid medium. Further experiments ruled out uneven aerosol distribution in the chamber or inefficient virus recovery as causes of this discrepancy. These findings indicate that aerosolized IAV and SARS-CoV-2 lost infectivity by approximately 2 log10 PFU within ∼10 min unless they attached to cells quickly. As natural infection via inhalation occurs by direct deposition of the virus onto cells, we hypothesize that sampling directly onto cells more accurately reflects the potential for exposure to lead to infection."

However, there is a dispute whether the hydrogen peroxide-induced regeneration of Fe(II) is the rate-limiting step in this process. This study systematically investigates the structure–activity relationship between organic substances and iron species in a Fenton-like system, with a focus on the degradation mechanism of phenolic pollutants. By integration of electrochemical characterization and quantum chemical calculation, three kinetic degradation modes are proposed, which are closely related to the molecular redox properties and coordination capability. The three phenolic–Fe(III) interaction modes include: (i) strong reductive electron transfer (zero-order kinetics), (ii) strong coordination forming ligand-stabilized Fe(III) complexes (autocatalysis), and (iii) synergistic electron transfer-coordination (mixed kinetics). Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the intramolecular electron transfer pathway within the organo–Fe(III)–hydroperoxide complex exhibits a significantly lower activation energy (0.77 eV less) than traditional radical-mediated pathways, rationalizing the dominance of direct electron transfer over hydroxyl radical generation. This finding provides a unified theoretical framework that resolves long-standing ambiguity in the Fenton-like mechanism and offers new substrate-specific wastewater treatment design guidance."

This study comprehensively investigates the occurrence and dietary exposure of ultrashort-chain PFASs through a China Total Diet Study. Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), perfluoropropanoic acid (PFPrA), and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMS) were detected in foods, exhibiting distinct differences in their dietary and regional distributions, particularly in plant-origin foods. Among them, TFA was the most prevalent and contributed the most in all food samples, with concentrations ranging from 1.45 to 39.0 ng/g (wet weight). These levels were 2-fold to 3-orders of magnitude higher than those of PFPrA and TFMS and other chain-length PFASs previously found in the same samples. Data on dietary exposure assessment indicated that the estimated dietary intake (EDI) of TFA ranged from 172.7 to 660.3 ng/kg body weight/day, accounting for an average of 96.9% of the total exposure to ∑17 PFASs for the general population. Furthermore, a preliminary assessment suggests that diet played a more significant role than drinking water in human exposure to ultrashort-chain PFASs, with plant-origin foods contributing over 90% of the total dietary exposure. These findings underscore the necessity for monitoring ultrashort-chain PFASs to assess their potential health risks from dietary exposure."

During the Georgia Wildland-Fire Simulation Experiment, we measured the hygroscopicity (κ) and size-resolved cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity of BB particles from controlled burns of fuel beds representative of three ecoregions in Georgia, United States. Primary BB particles were predominantly organic, and photooxidation in an oxidation flow reactor produced secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in a new nucleation mode while transforming primary organic aerosol (POA) into oxidized POA (OPOA) in the pre-existing accumulation mode. We measured hygroscopic growth from 20% to 90% relative humidity using a quartz crystal microbalance and assessed size-resolved CCN activity for particles from 30 to 350 nm at supersaturation between 0.13% and 0.99%. We found that the hygroscopicity parameter of OPOA (κOPOA = 0.10–0.19) was higher than that of POA (0.04–0.10), reflecting the influence of heterogeneous oxidation, whereas the hygroscopicity parameter of SOA (κSOA = 0.07–0.14) fell between the two. Both fresh and aged BB particles displayed size-dependent κ values and evidence of external mixing, likely because of complex emission characteristics of fuel beds and size-dependent deposition processes. Growth factor-derived and CCN-derived κ values were consistent when accounting for such heterogeneity. A strong positive correlation was found between the mass-averaged κ and O/C ratio, described by the regression κ = 0.31 ± 0.02(O/C) – 0.05 ± 0.02, which broadly agrees with previous findings for a wide range of laboratory SOA and ambient oxidized organic aerosols. This suggests the potential applicability of a generalized hygroscopicity parameterization across organic aerosols within acceptable uncertainty. Our results highlight the role of BB particles as significant CCN sources during atmospheric aging and emphasize the importance of heterogeneous oxidation in physicochemical evolution of BB particles."

However, their application is often limited by the requirement for complete continuous exposure data. Simpler lag-specific models with a single exposure can use more data but suffer from an omitted variable bias (OVB). This study develops and validates a three-stage method to accurately estimate distributed lag effects from noncontinuous exposure data by correcting for OVB. We propose a three-stage approach, fitting a series of lag-specific models using the noncontinuous data to obtain biased estimates in the first stage, correcting the bias by the autocorrelation structure of the exposure time series in the second stage, and smoothing the calibrated estimates in the third stage. The method’s validity was confirmed by statistical simulations. We then applied it to a case study analyzing the association between PM2.5, its chemical constituents, and daily all-cause mortality in Beijing from 2013 to 2015. Simulations showed that our three-stage method robustly and accurately recovered the true lag-response functions and cumulative effects, even when only one valid daily record is available for each week’s data. In the Beijing case study, the traditional DLM failed to find significant associations due to a substantially restricted sample size, due to the missingness. In contrast, our method, by utilizing nearly 90% more observations, found significant health effects. For every 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5, the cumulative effect (lag 0–13 days) on all-cause mortality was a 0.37% increase (95% CI: 0.23, 0.50%). Significant associations were also found for the PM2.5 constituents. The proposed three-stage method is an effective and robust statistical tool for overcoming challenges posed by noncontinuous exposure data in time-series analysis. By correcting for omitted variable bias, it maximizes the use of available sparse data and significantly enhances statistical power, offering a practical and reliable solution for environmental epidemiology facing similar data limitations."

While PFAS exposure has been linked to endocrine diseases, epidemiological evidence regarding its association with dyslipidemia and its subtypes remains limited. This study comprehensively evaluated the associations between serum PFAS levels and dyslipidemia (including its subtypes) in adults, while also investigating the effects on the Triglyceride-Glucose (TyG) index. We recruited a group of adult participants from Shandong Province, East China, which consisted of individuals with dyslipidemia and healthy controls. Multiple statistical approaches were applied, including multivariable logistic regression for single-PFAS associations, quantile-based g-computation (qg-comp) model for mixture effects, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) models for dose–response analyses. Serum concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), and 6:2 chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic acid (6:2 Cl-PFESA) were significantly associated with elevated TyG index levels. Exposure to PFOA and PFNA were associated with hypertriglyceridemia (odds ratio (OR) = 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01–1.09; OR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.15–3.50, respectively) and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.00–1.07; OR = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.01–2.94, respectively). PFOS and 6:2 Cl-PFESA were associated with an increased risk of hypercholesterolemia (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.02–1.23; OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.05–1.54, respectively). Furthermore, significant joint effects of PFAS mixture exposure were observed on the risk of dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypercholesterolemia, respectively. Dose–response analyses revealed predominantly linear relationships between most PFAS concentrations and dyslipidemia and its subtypes. Exceptions included significant nonlinear relationships for PFOA, PFNA, and PFOS with dyslipidemia; for 6:2 Cl-PFESA with hypercholesterolemia; and for PFOA and PFNA with hypertriglyceridemia. Taken together, these findings suggest that exposure to specific PFAS may contribute to endocrine disruption and increase the risk of dyslipidemia in a compound and subtype-specific manner. This study provides novel epidemiological evidence by simultaneously delineating the distinct and joint effects of multiple PFAS on dyslipidemia phenotypes and the TyG index. Our findings underscore the utility of the TyG index as a potential predictive indicator and highlight the importance of considering complex exposure patterns and nonlinear relationships in assessing the cardiometabolic risks of PFAS."

Fueled by their desire for a more diverse and inclusive field and passion for EO, underrepresented individuals found their main drivers for success in personal resilience, perseverance against hardships, self‐confidence, and lessons from lived experiences. Findings from this research can help create action plans, toolkits, and policies to make EO more inclusive for future generations across every career stage and sector."

Recent studies have uncovered potential cold‐to‐warm transitions in specific ice‐shelf cavities, which could lead to a dramatic increase in sea‐level rise. Here we demonstrate that brine rejection in coastal polynyas promotes bistable dynamics in ice‐shelf cavities, which would be otherwise monostable, for a broad diversity of Circumpolar Deep Water temperatures. We develop a generic low‐dimensional box model featuring warm and cold circulation modes and apply it to nine ice‐shelf cavities. We find that most ice‐shelf cavities are in a bistable regime and are therefore susceptible to irreversible abrupt transitions for a realistic range of sea‐ice formation rates. Bistability is robust to changes in cavity parameterization. However, the vertical mixing scheme at the ice‐shelf front can be tuned to make the transitions reversible."

Based on meteorological, satellite, and ground‐based ELF data, we reconstruct a realistic charge configuration for the parent thunderstorm. We input this reconstructed charge configuration to a 3D quasi‐electrostatic model in order to simulate regions of possible sprite inception as a function of time corresponding to this sprite event following the lightning. We demonstrate how the observed delayed sprite could have been incepted by a prolonged piecewise pattern of the current in the parent flash."

While some theoretical and numerical studies suggest that seismic waves are sensitive to fracture connectivity, an experimental validation of this critically important phenomenon was so far unavailable. In this study, we present a novel methodology for fabricating synthetic analogs of rock samples containing connected and unconnected fluid‐saturated fractures with well‐constrained geometric characteristics. Using a low‐frequency forced‐oscillation apparatus, we show that the P‐wave velocities are higher in samples with unconnected fractures than in those with connected ones. Complementary numerical simulations corroborate these findings and indicate that the dominant mechanism behind the observed differences is wave‐induced fluid pressure diffusion within connected fractures. Our results provide direct experimental evidence that, for otherwise identical fracture networks, the presence of interconnectivity produces a measurable reduction in P‐wave velocity at seismic frequencies, which is consistent with that previously predicted by corresponding numerical models. This, in turn, opens new and important perspectives for the seismo‐hydraulic characterization of fractured rocks."

Using two‐dimensional numerical simulations, we show that smaller branch structures evolve asymmetrically on the sides of striations when either the background electric field or the wave vector has a component along the density gradient. Our results indicate that in the linear stage, the electric field in the direction of density gradient modifies the effective growth rate by altering the wave vector orientation. In the nonlinear stage, electric field and wave vector direction coupling govern the emergence of branch structure, with electric field dominating when its effect opposes that of the wave vector.

However, how anthropogenic warming affects this variability remains uncertain due to limited satellite records and model resolution constraints. Based on an eddy‐resolving historical‐and‐future transient climate simulation, we find that the KE decadal variability weakens significantly under a high‐emissions scenario. This weakening likely results from a disruption of the coupled ocean‐atmosphere delayed oscillation, which involves basin‐scale atmospheric circulation both forcing and responding to KE variations. Specifically, warming‐induced strengthening of atmospheric stratification likely suppresses the thermodynamic adjustment, including the deep‐reaching updraft and associated mid‐to‐upper tropospheric responses, typically triggered by oceanic mesoscale warming during the KE stable state. Such suppression disrupts the coupled ocean‐atmosphere delayed oscillation, contributing to the weakened KE decadal variability. Our findings imply that the KE system might be less predictable under future warming."

The disequilibrium concept relates shoreline change to instantaneous and equilibrium beach states. While PF shifts the shoreline geometrically, SLR induces disequilibrium that produces wave‐driven changes due to apparent profile changes. For the first time, 24 experiments from wave flumes of different scale (including new high‐low energy cyclic waves experiments) are gathered into a dimensionless data set through a scaling technique to investigate SLR‐induced processes. The data indicate trends (possibly linear) between relative wave power and wave‐driven shoreline changes for a given SLR, highlighting the effects of changing background wave energy. Cyclic wave experiments best represent Bruun model's behavior. Wave‐energy dissipation emerges as a key variable for quantifying SLR‐induced disequilibrium, offering new pathways for future improvements of equilibrium shoreline models under SLR and wave‐climate change."

Globally, about 10% of low and 19% of high phytoplankton biomass extremes are detected. The detection rate is the result of the combined impacts of missing data and extreme misalignment: only 34% of low and 56% of high detected chlorophyll extremes correspond with true biomass extremes, with the largest discrepancies occurring in the subtropical gyres.

Here, we investigate the atmospheric response to idealized positive SST anomalies in the KE region using large‐ensemble atmospheric general circulation model experiments. The imposed forcing generates a robust sea‐level pressure anomaly over and downstream of the KE, leading to surface westerly wind anomalies extending into the subtropical North Pacific. Despite substantial atmospheric internal variability over the Aleutian Low region, these subtropical wind anomalies consistently emerge across the ensemble.

Using observing system simulation experiments with Orbiting Carbon Observatory‐2 (OCO‐2) sampling, we show that seasonally dependent sampling can lead to overestimated annual fluxes. These biases arise when prior flux seasonal cycle differs from the assumed truth. Since OCO‐2 provides more observations during the non‐growing season, posterior fluxes are more constrained in that period. When prior fluxes underestimate the seasonal amplitude, the posterior carbon sink during the growing season is underestimated, leading to a net positive bias. This effect is supported by real OCO‐2 data, where we hypothesize that underestimating fire emissions during non‐growing season and weaker seasonality of prior fluxes may contribute to overestimated annual fluxes. Our results highlight the need to improve prior flux estimates and expand observational coverage during the growing season to reduce biases in regional carbon budget assessments over NTA."

Four configurations are examined: the traditional approach that uses separate deep (ZM) and shallow (UW) convection schemes (CAM_ZMUW), unified shallow‐deep convection (CAM_UNICON), unified cloud‐turbulence (CAM_CLUBB), and super‐parameterization (CAM_SP). While precipitation is relatively insensitive to parameterization choice, diabatic heating fields differ markedly, which shape temperature, moisture and MRG wave characteristics. All simulations capture the general eastward tilt of MRG waves, but with varying fidelity. CAM_ZMUW and CAM_UNICON produce overly strong convection, while CAM_CLUBB underestimates low‐level early‐phase moistening. Only CAM_CLUBB and CAM_SP reproduce the successive vertical subgrid‐scale transport of moist static energy convergence, though the transport is weaker in CAM_CLUBB, whereas mass‐flux‐based schemes lack coherent vertical organization. Experiments combining Cloud Layers Unified by Binormals (CLUBB) with ZM deep convection behave similarly to CAM_ZMUW, indicating strong sensitivity to deep‐convection scheme. Applying stricter convective triggering in ZM convection alleviates the lower‐tropospheric dry bias but does not lead to an improved simulation of the convectively coupled MRG wave. The stochastic Subgrid Importance Latin Hypercube Sampler, a Monte Carlo technique designed to integrate over subgrid variability and improve estimates of its effects on microphysical process rates, has a relatively minor impact on MRG modeling in CLUBB. These results underscore the need to improve the representation of shallow‐to‐deep convective transitions in mass‐flux schemes and to enhance the vertical subgrid‐scale transport within the CLUBB framework."

The high spatial resolution Single Field‐of‐view Sounder Atmospheric Products (SiFSAP) retrieved from CrIS and ATMS measurement have been used to illustrate the emission and transport of the plume generated by the wildfires.

Furthermore, cloud optical depths and top pressures retrieved by SiFSAP and VIIRS were compared to assess the IR sounder's capability to retrieve clouds. Results indicated that the SiFSAP data products effectively capture not only large scale dry airmass transport but also the movement of wildfire‐generated plumes containing high CO concentrations.

However, this expansion rate has yet to be compared systematically between hemispheres and across basins. This work quantifies the poleward expansion of PI globally and compares it across basins using ERA5 reanalysis and an ensemble of CMIP6 historical and future climate scenarios. We quantify trends in the latitude of PI thresholds associated with TC intensity and directly decompose PI trends into thermodynamic drivers using a novel PI budget equation that distinguishes Clausius‐Clapeyron response to warming from other effects. Our results show that PI consistently expands strongly poleward near Western Boundary Currents (WBCs) in the Western North Pacific, North Atlantic, South Indian, and South Pacific. It expands slowly near EBCs in the Eastern North Pacific and South Indian basins. Basins with WBC outflow exhibit enhanced coastal PI trends linked to SST warming, outflow cooling, and poleward ocean heat transport. Southern Hemisphere basins display weaker expansion, except near strong WBCs. CMIP6 models capture this east‐west asymmetry in PI trends across basins, but underestimate the magnitude of poleward expansion rates due to misrepresenting changes in outflow temperature and near‐surface air temperature and humidity. Our analysis suggests that ocean circulation plays a critical role in shaping regional PI trends and future increases in TC risk at higher latitudes will be unevenly distributed and may depend locally on the orientation of the coastline relative to oceanic boundary currents."

Here, we introduce a storyline‐probability combined attribution framework to quantify individual contributions of atmospheric circulation, La Niña, and anthropogenic warming to this unprecedented 2022 SCHFE. Reanalysis and simulations show that La Niña generated large‐scale circulation patterns conducive to the SCHFE, amplifying the event's severity even when circulation anomalies were weaker than 2022. The SCHFE‐associated atmospheric circulation dynamics accounted for 49.21% (38.64%–59.41%) of the SCHFE's intensity and increased its likelihood by a factor of 4.5 compared with unrelated circulation. Anthropogenic warming contributed 42.31% (34.32%–49.85%) of the intensity throughout the thermodynamic effects, comparable to the circulation‐induced dynamic contribution, while also enhancing the occurrence probability of both La Niña and SCHFE. Projections further indicate that La Niña events will substantially elevate the probability of SCHFEs under continued warming.

We present eight years of austral summer observations (2016–2023) from ships of opportunity traveling between New Zealand and Antarctica, along with time series measurements from Baring Head New Zealand, Macquarie Island Australia and Arrival Heights Antarctica. We observe lower Δ14C in the 50°S to 70°S latitude band, consistent with upwelling of 14C‐depleted deep waters in this region. We then combine ocean model simulations of CO2 and 14C with atmospheric dispersion model simulations to predict surface atmosphere Δ14C and compare with the observations. Our model simulations capture the large scale observed spatial patterns with considerable accuracy. However, the model simulation somewhat underestimates the magnitude of the observed atmospheric Δ14C gradient, particularly between 50°S and 60°S. When we artificially increase the strength of the strongest winds over the Southern Ocean in the ocean model, we find an improved match with the Δ14C observations, demonstrating that Δ14C observations with dense spatial resolution across the Southern Ocean can be useful for testing ocean model and CO2 exchange parameters."

Here, we report the first observations of the most abundant PSC composition class, NAT‐containing mixtures (one of whose components is nitric acid trihydrate, NAT, particles), from measurements of a passive nadir‐viewing sounder, the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI). We show the unambiguous presence of the characteristic peak signature of small NAT particles near 820 cm−1 ${\text{cm}}^{-1}$ in IASI spectra. By developing a detection method specific to the South Pole, we further demonstrate that NAT‐containing PSCs can be detected systematically during the polar winter, despite a reduced sensitivity over the continent. This method allows us to obtain an innovative data set in terms of spatial and temporal sampling. With respect to the physicochemical processes at play in the Antarctic stratosphere, we show a high degree of consistency between the 2008–2024 time series of detected NAT‐containing PSCs, stratospheric temperatures and total columns of nitric acid."

This is primarily due to its ultra‐efficient computational design and the availability of high‐quality NEON observational data. We conducted a Parameter Perturbation Ensemble (PPE) experiment using the Community Land Model version 5 (CLM5) at three NEON tower sites in the Southeastern U.S. We analyzed a subset of 30 parameters that influence carbon‐water cycle processes, running a total of 244,800 yrs of CLM5 simulations, which included 200 yrs of spin‐up and 4 yrs of production runs for each of the 400 parameter sets across three sites (3 sites × 400 parameter sets × 204 yrs). The best‐performing parameter set was identified by equally weighting normalized model performance for gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET). Joint calibration of both GPP and ET achieved the highest overall model performance (0.89), outperforming GPP‐only (0.75), ET‐only (0.78), and the default configuration (0.70) on a normalized scale from 0 to 1. Additionally, optimization produced a revised value for the hydraulic trait parameter psi50 that aligns more closely with trait‐based observations. When applied regionally at Ozarks Complex domain, the optimized point‐scale parameters reduced gross primary productivity overestimation by 39% and evapotranspiration underestimation by 10% compared to the default CLM5 configuration. Despite these improvements, challenges in upscaling remain due to uncertainties in input data and reference data sets, as well as the limited temporal and spatial coverage of NEON observations."

Kirtman,Sources of Subseasonal Predictability for Precipitation in South America Based on Model Experiments,"This study investigates the sources of predictability underlying subseasonal precipitation skill over South America in existing subseasonal prediction systems. Using subseasonal re‐forecasts from the NCAR‐CESM2 model, we demonstrate that significant skill persists even when interannual variability is removed. The highest skill occurs during austral summer and spring. To isolate sources of predictability, we analyze a novel set of re‐forecast experiments initialized with climatological atmosphere, land and ocean states. Results indicate that atmospheric initial conditions are essential for achieving skill, while ocean initializations contribute to skill containing interannual variability and land initializations contribute minimally to skill. Canonical correlation analysis is used to identify the most skillful spatial patterns and associated time series during the high‐skill seasons. The most skillful patterns in December–February are not independent of the South American dipole but also contain additional skill beyond the dipole. This additional skill is not associated with propagating tropical convection or sea surface temperature anomalies indicating that the Madden–Julian Oscillation, El Niño–Southern Oscillation, or South Atlantic SST variability are not the sources of predictability. Instead, a wave‐train‐like structure extends across the South Pacific, resembling a Rossby wave response. Idealized experiments using a simplified atmospheric general circulation model show that this pattern can be reproduced by stationary tropical heating over the Maritime Continent, suggesting a dynamical link between tropical heating and South American precipitation variability on subseasonal timescales independent of ENSO and the MJO."

The method is based on formulating and integrating dynamical systems whose attractive set, that is, stable fixed points, is constituted of extreme states residing on the convex hull, namely archetypes. It is shown that these states tend to organize into clusters leading to the concept of ’hull clustering’. The method is applied to tropical monthly sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the period 1950–2014 and to the 850‐K northern hemispheric winter potential vorticity over the period 1979–2021. The SST archetype clusters yield broadly five clusters reflecting El‐Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) flavors, representing conventional and Modoki El‐Niño and La‐Niña phases. The application to the stratospheric polar vortex yields broadly three to five clusters representing different states of the winter polar vortex including splitting and displacement over parts of the northern hemisphere.

Collins,Evaluating Atmospheric River Impacts on Energy and Moisture Transport in the Arctic Using Different Detection Algorithms,"Atmospheric rivers (ARs) significantly impact the Arctic climate system by enhancing atmospheric heat and moisture transport and altering the local energy budget. Developing AR detection tools (ARDTs) is critical yet challenging. This study evaluates 12 ARDTs in the Arctic to assess their performance in representing atmospheric heat (represented by moist static energy) and moisture transport, as well as surface downward longwave radiation (LWD) and precipitation impacts, spanning 2000 to 2019 using ERA5 reanalysis. We find that AR occurrence frequency in the Arctic varies widely, from less than 1% to over 13%, depending on the ARDT. This variability leads to differences in contributions to poleward atmospheric heat (<1%–33%) and moisture (<1%–49%) transport. The highest AR frequency, and corresponding contributions to atmospheric heat and moisture transport, occurs over the Atlantic sector during non‐summer seasons for most ARDTs. This region aligns with the primary poleward moisture pathway and the end of climatological mid‐latitude storm tracks, highlighting strong connections between Arctic ARs and mid‐latitude cyclones. ARs induce significant LWD anomalies, largest in winter, smallest in summer, and also substantially contribute to the seasonal precipitation. Global ARDTs detect fewer ARs with larger anomalies (>100 W m−2 in higher Arctic), but contribute <1% to seasonal climatological LWD and precipitation. In contrast, polar‐specific ARDTs detect higher AR occurrences and account for up to 16% of seasonal LWD and 41% precipitation. This suggests that algorithms emphasizing extreme events with large anomalies do not necessarily indicate a large climate radiative and precipitation impact."

Singh,The Moist Static Energy Budget of Australian Summer Monsoon Bursts in Climate Models: Insights From Present and Warming Climate Scenarios,"This study investigates the complex dynamics of burst evolution in the Australian summer monsoon under present‐day and warmer climate conditions. Using reanalysis data, historical atmosphere‐only simulations (AMIP), and simulations with uniformly increased sea surface temperatures (+4K; AMIP+4K), we examine how seasonal‐mean precipitation and burst behavior respond to warming across eight climate models. A consistent link emerges between higher seasonal‐mean precipitation and a greater number of bursts. A moist static energy budget analysis reveals that horizontal moisture advection governs burst evolution, while model‐specific parameterizations add variability in burst characteristics. Some models show gradual transitions governed by horizontal moisture advection, others display abrupt shifts absent in reanalysis. Among the three models with AMIP+4K simulations, MRI‐ESM2‐0 and BCC‐CSM2‐MR reproduce seasonal precipitation patterns close to their AMIP counterparts, with burst frequencies nearly unchanged in BCC‐CSM2‐MR and slightly reduced in MRI‐ESM2‐0. Only MRI‐ESM2‐0 captures a gradual, physically consistent burst evolution resembling reanalysis, whereas BCC‐CSM2‐MR still shows abrupt transitions. IPSL‐CM6A‐LR, the third model with AMIP+4K simulations, shows a gradual evolution but produces stronger mean precipitation and fewer bursts—contrary to the typical positive precipitation–burst relationship. Cluster‐based composites show that precipitation changes arise from differing contributions of thermodynamic and dynamic components of vertical moisture advection. In MRI‐ESM2‐0, enhanced precipitation in warming scenarios is mainly driven by stronger thermodynamic moistening, whereas in IPSL‐CM6A‐LR, dynamically induced drying offsets thermodynamic gains, particularly in specific burst clusters. These results emphasize model‐dependent monsoon burst responses and the need to separate dynamic and thermodynamic influences to strengthen confidence in future hydro‐climate projections."

However, the observed changes in streamflow in these basins and their drivers remain poorly understood. Using in situ and satellite observations, and hydrological modeling, we show contrasting trends, with a ∼8% (p‐value = 0.046) increase in streamflow in the Indus Basin due to rising precipitation. In contrast, a sharp decline of ∼17% (p‐value = 0.008) in the Ganga Basin driven by intensive groundwater pumping during 1980–2021 and despite the overall increase in streamflow in the Indus Basin, two sub‐basins, Ravi and Sutlej, faced a decline in streamflow. Three major sub‐basins of the Ganga River, including Yamuna, Ramganga, and Upper Ganga, also experienced a decline in streamflow. About 60%–80% of the streamflow decline in the Ganga Basin is attributable to intensive groundwater pumping, further amplified by weakening summer monsoon precipitation. Drought‐induced groundwater pumping exacerbates river drying, especially during the dry season (October–May). Our findings highlight the dominant role of coupled climate‐human interactions in driving streamflow changes and emphasize the urgency of integrated surface‐groundwater management to safeguard water and food security in India."

These coatings amplify radiative effects, according to a model–data analysis for 2023. 
 Black carbon is a global climate forcer due to its strong radiative absorption, which is highly sensitive to coating formation regulated by anthropogenic and biogenic emissions. However, how cross-regional biogenic sources modulate urban black carbon coating and radiative effects remains poorly understood. Here we integrate observations and model simulations to investigate such biogenic–anthropogenic interactions in eastern China. The results show that biogenic volatile organic compounds from vegetation-rich regions undergo atmospheric oxidation to produce oxygenated organic compounds, which are subsequently advected into downwind urban areas. These products enhance regional atmospheric oxidation capacity and supply additional precursors, thereby promoting secondary organic aerosol production. This biogenic-induced strengthening of regional photochemistry drives the formation of highly oxidized secondary organic aerosol coatings on black carbon and increases its fraction within the total particle population. Consequently, black carbon absorption efficiency increases more steeply with the coating carbon oxidation state under biogenic-rich conditions, yielding an average ~20% enhancement in radiative absorption from the lensing effect relative to biogenic-poor periods. Our findings reveal that cross-regional biogenic–anthropogenic interactions enhance both the formation and particle population fraction of secondary organic aerosol coatings on urban black carbon, potentially further amplifying its radiative effects as biogenic emissions increase under future warming scenarios. Biogenic–anthropogenic interactions increase the formation and prevalence of secondary organic aerosol coatings on urban black carbon in Nanjing, China.

Here, the authors report that ATRX loss can perturb alpha-globin gene expression by promoting G4- and R-loop-associated DNA damage via a G-rich repeat. 
 Germline mutations in the chromatin remodelling protein ATRX cause a severe developmental disorder associated with α-thalassemia. In addition, ATRX is amongst the twenty genes most frequently mutated in cancer. How ATRX mutations alter gene expression remains unclear. Using the α-globin locus as a model, here we show that ATRX deficiency downregulates α-globin in a subset of cells exhibiting DNA damage. A G-rich repeat at the α-globin locus serves as a potential site of G-quadruplex formation and DNA damage. ATRX binds this repeat co-transcriptionally, and its loss increases R-loop accumulation at this site, leading to local DNA damage and transcriptional disruption in cis. Deletion of this repeat abolishes this effect, while targeted DNA damage reinstates it. These findings reveal a mechanism linking ATRX’s role in genome stability to transcriptional regulation and uncover a molecular basis of human genetic disease mediated via a distal G-rich repeat.

 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) usually possess a polycrystalline nature as well as lower porosity and surface area than 3D counterparts, restraining their exploration over gas storage applications. Herein, a substituent strategy has been proposed and employed to generate three robust single-crystal 2D COFs isomers with atom-resolution structures determined by 3D electron diffraction. Among three isomers, a precise engineering of their interlayer distance affords the highest Brunauer−Emmett−Teller surface area of ~2100 m2 g−1 and the largest pore volume of 1.40 cm3 g−1 for the desolvated GZU-1. This COF shows the highest total volumetric methane uptake of 240 cm3 (STP) cm−3 at 273 K and 100 bar among 2D COFs, even comparable with those for excellent 3D MOFs. This work not only delivers unique insight into the design of 2D single-crystal COFs by interlayer stacking regulation, but also promotes the application of highly porous 2D COFs in gas storage. 2D covalent organic frameworks usually possess a polycrystalline nature as well as lower porosity and surface area than 3D counterparts, limiting their gas storage application.

 Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) consists of degraded DNA fragments released into body fluids. Its genetic and pathological information makes it useful for prenatal testing and early tumor detection. However, the mechanisms behind cfDNA biology are largely unknown. In this study, for the first time, we conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to explore the genetic basis of cfDNA end motif frequencies, termed cfGWAS, in 28,016 pregnant women. We identify 15 study-wide significant loci, including the well-known cfDNA-related genes DFFB and DNASE1L3, as well as novel genes potentially involved in cfDNA biology, such as PANX1 and DNASE1L1. The findings are further verified through three independent GWAS studies and experimental validation in knockout mice and cell lines. Subsequent analyses reveal strong causal relationships of leukocytes, especially neutrophils, with cfDNA features. In summary, we introduce the cfGWAS, revealing the genetic basis of cfDNA biology on a genome-wide scale. Novel knowledge uncovered by this study promises to revolutionize liquid biopsy technology and lead to potential new drugs targeting certain diseases. Given that millions of cfDNA whole genome sequencing data have been generated from clinical testing, the potential of this paradigm is enormous.

Various photothermal conversion efficiencies (23% − 81%) are obtained because of the synergistic effect of π···π stacking interactions and the free radical effect of building units. This finding enables the precise regulation of topology, thereby leading to a remarkable enhancement in photothermal conversion efficiency.

 Purine nucleotides are ubiquitous molecules essential for all life. The de novo biosynthesis of purines is a metabolic dependency that is frequently reprogrammed in cancers and is a well-established target for chemotherapies, immune modulation and antivirals. Here, we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of the multi-domain human phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase, a central purine biosynthetic enzyme and foundational feature of the purinosome metabolon. These data capture, the proposed iminophosphate intermediate and provide the structural elucidation of an ammonia channel connecting the active sites of the glutaminase and synthase domains. Analysis of this series of structures and the accompanying biochemical data also reveal the molecular features and transient conformational changes that underlie allosteric regulation and catalytic coupling of the domains. This data resolves several longstanding mechanistic questions about this enzyme class and provides a strong foundation for therapeutic development.

 Vibrational spectroscopy is a powerful tool for spectral imaging of biological samples, thanks to its narrow bandwidth (10 cm⁻¹) compared to fluorescence. Single-molecule vibrational spectroscopy has been demonstrated with near-field amplification as in surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy or fluorescence detection as in stimulated Raman excited fluorescence and bond-selective fluorescence-detected infrared-excited spectro-microscopy. However, these methods often require elaborate sample preparation or sometimes generate background signals when unintended processes lead to fluorescence emission. In response to these issues, we developed electronic resonance stimulated Raman scattering (ER-SRS) to achieve single-molecule sensitivity in far-field vibrational microscopy without relying on fluorescence detection. ER-SRS has encountered difficulties due to large electronic backgrounds. To overcome this, we employed Raman-amplified nonfluorescent molecular probe (RANMP) alongside our synchronously pumped, independently tunable double optical parametric oscillators for effective optimization of the signal-to-background ratio. The optimization of probe and light source allowed us to successfully detect ER-SRS signal from single particles in solution and from single molecules embedded in polymer matrix. ER-SRS combined with RANMP provides single-molecule sensitivity without fluorescence detection, enabling applications in biological and chemical imaging, particularly in multiplexed imaging. This study demonstrates far-field single-molecule Raman detection without fluorescence or nearfield enhancement by integrating electronically resonant stimulated Raman scattering with nonfluorescent, highly conjugated molecular probes and an independently tunable dual-OPO laser system."

Under a warming climate, projected intensification of ENSO will amplify SSS heterogeneity. 
 Salinity shapes ocean circulation and marine biogeography, yet its long-term spatiotemporal variability and ecological impacts in marginal seas remain poorly constrained. We reconstruct a high-resolution sea surface salinity dataset (2000–2020) for the China Seas using a machine learning framework that integrates in situ cruises and buoys with satellite observations and diagnose drivers with an eigen microstates approach. The El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the dominant control, modulating evaporation–precipitation, river discharge and Kuroshio intrusion. During El Niño, sea surface salinity increases by up to 25% in ocean-dominated regions but decreases up to 21% in river-dominated zones, amplifying meridional salinity contrasts. Species-distribution models indicate a southward habitat shift up to 2.5° latitude for 90% of key fish species. Under projected ENSO intensification, salinity inhomogeneity and associated ecological impacts are likely to strengthen. These results support an ‘ENSO forcing–salinity–fishery’ positive feedback framework and call for integrating salinity dynamics into adaptive, climate-informed fisheries management.

 Antarctic sea ice is projected to decline with continued global climate change, potentially impacting Antarctic ecosystems on several levels. Here using a series of models, we show that substantial regional and seasonal differences exist in when and how climate change patterns manifest in Antarctic sea ice, phytoplankton, krill, fish and penguins. Climate-driven changes in fish and penguins tend to emerge from historic variability earlier than sea ice and lower trophic levels. Changes are highly seasonal and can be either negative or positive; for example, krill growth increases in the spring, but decreases in the summer in many regions. The earliest climate signals emerge in Eastern Antarctic regions, while the Ross Sea remains a refuge from climate change into the twenty-first century. In the coming decades, summer sea ice loss in the Weddell Sea could improve the region for fish and krill growth, while remaining habitable for Emperor penguins.

This study presents maps of emissions globally for different crops, showing that drained peatlands, rice paddies and fertilizer were the main drivers, and highlights differences in emission intensity. 
 Spatially explicit cropland greenhouse gas emission data are essential for identifying emission hotspots and guiding sustainable mitigation strategies. Here we develop high-resolution (5 arcmin) global maps of cropland emissions across 46 crop classes in 2020 by integrating sectoral datasets on synthetic fertilizer, manure, crop residue, in-field burning, rice cultivation and cultivated drained peatlands. Global croplands emitted 2.5 (95% CI 2.4–2.7) GtCO2e yr−1, with drained peatlands (35%), rice paddies (35%) and synthetic fertilizer (23%) as the primary contributors. Four crops—rice, maize, oil palm and wheat—accounted for 67% of total emissions. Emission areal intensities averaged 2 MgCO2e ha−1 globally, with higher intensities in Asia and Europe, where croplands also achieved high caloric productivity. Spatial correlations between emission intensity and production efficiency reveal geographic trade-offs between mitigation potential and food production. The resulting dataset establishes a unified global framework for a spatially explicit assessment of agricultural emissions and efficiency.

 Atmospheric rivers (ARs) and marine heatwaves (MHWs) are two major extreme events of the climate system that strongly influence the ocean–atmosphere interface, yet their mutual interactions remain poorly understood. Here we use long-term oceanic and atmospheric reanalysis datasets (OISST and ERA5) from 1982 to 2023 to quantify the interactions and feedbacks between ARs and MHWs over the North Pacific. Longer and more intense events exhibit a higher probability of overlapping, resulting in nearly 85% of ARs and 57% of MHWs being linked to the other system. Pronounced hotspots of co-occurrence emerge in the mid-latitudes, where both systems frequently develop. ARs promote ocean surface warming and exacerbate MHW intensity by enhancing surface heat fluxes dominated by latent heat, together with increased downward longwave and sensible heat fluxes over the North Pacific north of 40° N. Conversely, MHWs slightly suppress local AR intensity by weakening horizontal winds, while mesoscale convection and cyclonic disturbances disrupt integrated vapor transport. This effect is partially offset by enhanced moisture associated with stronger convection. These findings reveal a bidirectional coupling between oceanic and atmospheric extremes and highlight the need to examine their relationship across other ocean basins and under future warming scenarios to better anticipate compound climate risks."

 Antarctic sea ice variability has long been characterized by a dipole pattern primarily located in West Antarctica, attributed to the Amundsen Sea Low and remote forcing from the tropical Pacific, while variability in other sectors has received less attention. Here we reveal a tripole-like pattern of sea ice variability spanning multiple sectors of Antarctica, comprising the classic dipole together with seasonally varying centers in East Antarctica during austral winter and spring. Using observational analyses and numerical experiments, we demonstrate that, unlike the dipole, this tripole is not governed solely by the Amundsen Sea Low. Instead, it emerges from paired atmospheric circulation anomalies that impose coherent wind forcing along the sea ice edge, initiated by Rossby wave trains from the Pacific, Indian Ocean and Maritime Continent. These findings provide a broader framework for Antarctic sea ice variability and highlight previously overlooked Indian Ocean-Maritime Continent drivers of Antarctic climate predictability.

 Marine microorganisms drive the Earth’s biogeochemical cycles, yet most cannot be cultured in laboratories, severely limiting in-depth studies of their ecological roles and application potential. In a decade-long study, we isolated 16,931 microbial strains from 1516 sampling sites across seven oceanic regions. By integrating omics and environmental data, we found that light conditions—such as long-term variations in sunlight at different latitudes and depths—are key factors shaping microbial biogeography and metabolic strategies. Moreover, 71.67% of the strains exhibited strict light-pattern specificity, a trait linked to differences in metabolic strategies adapted to their native environments. Based on this, we developed a database to predict optimal culture conditions for uncultured microorganisms, clarified the core reasons for their culturability challenges, and provided a practical pathway for exploring the potential of unknown microbes.

 As a major ocean circulation system, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) may approach a critical transition under anthropogenic forcing, yet how large-scale AMOC changes imprint on regional circulation pathways remains incompletely understood. While persistent changes in overturning are expected to be meridionally coherent, their horizontal expression may be highly non-uniform. Here, we use 22,000-year-long transient deglacial climate simulations to examine how latitudinally coherent AMOC variations are redistributed across the upper Atlantic circulation. By separating externally forced, long-term AMOC changes from internally generated, short-term variability, we show that the former are disproportionately reflected along the full meridional extent of the South Atlantic western boundary current system. In contrast, North Atlantic counterparts relate primarily to higher-frequency, unforced AMOC variability. Our findings highlight South Atlantic western boundary transports as outstanding fingerprints of past externally forced AMOC changes, thereby outlining their particular sensitivity to a predicted, anthropogenically forced weakening of the AMOC. Persistent changes in the Atlantic overturning circulation leave their clearest imprint on the South Atlantic western boundary current system, revealing an overlooked regional sensitivity, according to transient climate simulations spanning the past 22,000 years."

 Accurate field-scale evapotranspiration (ET) data with high spatiotemporal resolution is crucial for characterizing surface energy and water balance dynamics and guiding water resource management. OpenET, implemented on Google Earth Engine (GEE), provides field-scale ET estimates and relies mainly on Landsat data. Although Landsat thermal infrared (TIR) observations are effective for field-scale ET mapping, the ∼8-day revisit interval of the combined Landsat 8/9 constellation provides insufficient temporal sampling for short-term ET dynamics. This study presents a framework to improve the spatiotemporal resolution of ET mapping by integrating TIR observations from ECOSTRESS and VIIRS with Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel (HLS) data on GEE. Land surface temperature (LST) data from Landsat, ECOSTRESS and VIIRS were sharpened to 30-m resolution using the Data Mining Sharpener (DMS) algorithm. These sharpened LST data, along with 30-m Leaf Area Index (LAI) and albedo derived from HLS, were used as inputs to the GEE-based Disaggregated Atmosphere-Land Exchange (DisALEXI) model to produce daily 30-m ET estimates. ET estimates were validated against flux tower observations and compared with baseline Landsat-derived ET at six sites with varying land cover and climatic conditions. Results indicated that incorporating ECOSTRESS and VIIRS generally improved ET estimation accuracy, reducing average MAE (mm/day) by 8.64% (1.12 to 1.02, daily), 14.40% (1.00 to 0.85, weekly), 16.37% (0.82 to 0.69, monthly) relative to Landsat-only baselines.

 Shrub fractional abundance (SFA), the proportion of shrub cover per unit area, serves as a critical indicator of environmental aridity and ecosystem health in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly across the Mongolian steppe. However, large-scale SFA mapping in Mongolian steppe ecosystems remains challenging due to the small crown size of shrubs, their sparse distribution, and spectral overlap with coexisting low vegetation (e.g., grasses and herbs), which hinders accurate detection using coarser-resolution satellite data or traditional field surveys. To address these challenges, we developed a two-step approach that integrates very-high-resolution (VHR) imagery, time-series Sentinel-2 data, and deep learning techniques. First, we generated high-accuracy benchmark maps of individual shrub crowns from 0.5 m VHR imagery by combining manual segmentation with a hybrid deep learning framework (Dino V2 and convolutional neural networks). Second, we used these shrub crown maps as training data to build an XGBoost model for predicting SFA from 20 m Sentinel-2 time-series data, leveraging phenological information to improve estimation. We validated our approach across 70 sites (1km2 each) in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which is representative of Mongolian steppe ecosystems. From VHR imagery, we mapped 1.31 million shrub crowns with an accuracy of R2 = 0.92. Scaling up with Sentinel-2 data yielded regional SFA maps with an R2 = 0.60. Further SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis on the developed XGBoost model revealed that phenological metrics (particularly observations in early-May, mid-July, and late-September), which distinguish shrub phenology from that of other land cover types (e.g., grasses and bare soil), were the most influential predictors of SFA. Finally, our regional SFA maps uncovered unimodal relationships between shrub distribution and climate variables, peaking at mean annual minimum temperatures near 0 °C and annual precipitation around 200 mm. Collectively, these findings demonstrate how the integration of multi-source remote sensing and machine learning can overcome historical limitations in SFA mapping, enabling accurate, spatially continuous assessments across vast Inner-Mongolian steppe ecosystems. Our framework has the potential to be applied to other steppe ecosystems and dryland ecosystems across the Mongolian steppe and beyond, offering a foundation for improved monitoring and ecological impact assessments in the face of global climate changes."

 Water level can be effectively monitored through satellite remote sensing. However, a persistent challenge lies in balancing spatial coverage and resolution. High-resolution data provide detailed information but suffer from limited spatial coverage, while low-resolution data are inadequate for accurate large-scale monitoring. In this paper, a super-resolution approach with machine learning is proposed to enhance the accuracy of water level monitoring as a solution to this problem. By leveraging Real-world Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (Real-ESRGAN) and a high-quality pretrained model, this study enhances the spatial resolution of Sentinel-1 SAR imagery, whose features are then used to develop a water level estimation model, enabling dynamic monitoring of river water levels. Results show that after super-resolution, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is reduced to 0.322 m (∼30.6% decrease), the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) increases to 0.957, and the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (R) improves to 0.987. The proposed super-resolution approach improves both spatial resolution (to 2.5 m/pixel) and water level estimation accuracy. Moreover, the results from representative stations, including densely urbanized regions, agricultural irrigation zones, and areas near sluices, show that our super-resolution approach provides accurate water level estimates and reliable trend predictions. Our experiments confirm its usefulness across a diverse spectrum of high accuracy hydrological monitoring scenarios."

 Urban areas across Africa have undergone unprecedented growth, posing significant challenges for sustainable development, infrastructure planning, and climate resilience. Existing mapping products often struggle to capture the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of these evolving urban landscapes, highlighting the need for maps that are both up-to-date and locally relevant. This study introduces a practical, cloud-based solution: an online tool for site-specific mapping (i.e., tailored maps for a defined area of interest) that leverages the capabilities of Google Earth Engine. The tool uses Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery to derive a wide range of spectral and texture metrics, supplemented by terrain data, and is trained using open building footprint datasets available for 2022. In an experimental setup, nine model configurations were tested under varying data availability conditions across 100 urban sites in Africa. The best-performing model achieved a mean F1-score of 0.59 (recall 0.63; precision 0.51) when validated against building footprints, with higher accuracy observed in dense urban areas. This configuration was integrated into the freely available ‘Do-it-yourself built-up mapping tool’ (DIY-BU). A quantitative analysis across the 100 test sites showed that the maps generated by our tool for 2022 were substantially more accurate (with an increase of F1-score by 0.18–0.30) than global multi-temporal products analysed for the same period (i.e., Dynamic World, ESRI land cover, GISA, GLC_FCS30D and GISD30). While the quantitative assessment was limited to the 2022 reference year, and the multi-temporal maps rely on a monotonic growth assumption (preventing the detection of demolition), a qualitative analysis highlighted the tool’s advantages in capturing detailed urban expansion and small-scale structures. The DIY-BU-mapping tool offers a valuable resource for a variety of applications, including urban planning, infrastructure monitoring, disaster preparedness and climate adaptation. Beyond presenting the tool’s functionality, the paper discusses its limitations and potential applications across diverse geographic and data availability contexts."

 From 2018 onwards, multiple droughts and heatwaves hit Central Europe including Germany. These triggered, together with other disturbance drivers, unprecedented damages to forests. While annual field-based crown defoliation surveys provide valuable insights into overall forest condition in Germany, continuous spatio-temporal dynamics are not explicitly addressed in current monitoring practices. Here, we present a forest canopy cover loss (FCCL) assessment in Germany at monthly resolution between September 2017 and September 2024 based on Sentinel-2 and Landsat satellite time series. This approach enables near-continuous monitoring of forest disturbance dynamics across spatial and temporal scales. Our results reveal that a strip in central Germany was most affected. Storm events in late 2017 and early 2018 caused the first large-scale canopy losses, while drought- and heat-related disturbances, including bark beetle outbreaks in spruce forests, dominated in 2019 and 2020. FCCL rates generally declined after 2020. We recorded a total of 924,000 ha FCCL over the seven-year period (8.4% of Germany’s forest area), 84.5% of which were found in coniferous forests. At district and municipality level, we detected FCCL of up to more than 50%. Two-thirds of FCCL were recorded during winter (November-April), underscoring the importance of off-season monitoring. This study demonstrates the value of dense, multi-sensor satellite time series for operational forest monitoring. It highlights regions with high future disturbance potential, particularly in southern and southeastern Germany due to their high share of spruce forests. Future monitoring should integrate seasonal data and early-warning systems to improve adaptive forest management at national scale."

 This study characterizes the amplitude changes associated with the 4 December 2021 eruption of Mount Semeru and maps the resulting deposits using Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter and PlanetScope optical imagery. Results show that lahar deposits caused surface smoothening which reduced SAR backscatter, whereas pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) increased backscatter due to higher moisture content. We have also shown the potential of differential polarimetric responses between surface cover types to identify areas of channel widening and vegetation destruction, providing a rapid means of identifying impacted areas in the context of volcanic crisis management. The supervised classification of SAR and high-resolution optical images enabled the production of an accurate geomorphological map able to separate different pyroclastic flow and lahar flow deposits both sedimentologically and spatially. Classified channelized lahar deposits were also used to quantify channel widening associated with the eruption, which significantly impacted the Supiturang Village."

 Climate change is escalating the frequency and intensity of droughts and wildfires globally. In New Caledonia, future intensification is projected, yet the seasonal and directional temporal relationships between vegetation drought and wildfire activity remain insufficiently characterized at the regional scale. This study presents a regional case study combining remote sensing and in-situ datasets spanning 2000–2024, aggregated at monthly and municipal scales, to analyse drought–fire temporal interactions in New Caledonia. The approach quantifies the temporal sequencing of interactions between vegetation condition and burned area occurrence, distinguishing periods when vegetation stress precedes fire activity (fire hazard) from periods when fire occurrence is followed by altered vegetation conditions (post-fire vulnerability and potential feedbacks). Lagged and seasonal correlation analyses were conducted using the Vegetation Health Index (VHI) as a proxy of vegetation drought and the Burned areas Anomaly Index (BAI) to characterize wildfire activity. Results reveal robust and spatially coherent correlations between vegetation drought and burned area extent, highlighting the strong association between VHI and subsequent wildfire activity. Distinct seasonal interaction patterns emerge, with vegetation condition preceding fire activity during the early dry season (August–September), while fire occurrence is followed by modified surface conditions over subsequent months (November–May), consistent with post-fire ecosystem vulnerability and feedback mechanism. Marked geographic contrasts are observed, particularly between the west and east coasts. These findings improve understanding of drought–fire temporal linkages in New Caledonia and provide actionable, region-specific insights for seasonally targeted and spatially explicit wildfire risk management."

 In this work, we described and characterized a novel online instrument for oxidative potential (OP) measurement using the ferrous orange xylenol (FOX) assay. This assay, based on the Fenton reaction, allows a good sensitivity for H2O2 with a LOD of 0.2 μg H2O2/m3 and an acceptable CV of 12%. Laboratory tests indicated that the instrument is responding to O3 and tert-butyl hydroperoxide but not to NO2. Its 5-min sampling and analysis cycle is short enough to catch the fast decay of the reactive and unstable oxidants potentially presents in the ambient aerosol. These analytical specifications allowed us to continuously quantify the total OPFOX — gaseous + particulate — during more than 20 days at an urban monitoring station in Lausanne (Switzerland) for three different periods of the year. Random Forest Regression and Multiple Linear Regression were used and compared in the development of a time-independent predictive model for OPFOX. Random Forest Regression performed better than the Multiple Linear regression, particularly at high OPFOX values. These results strongly suggest that this online instrument responds to photochemically generated gaseous oxidants, particularly H2O2 and O3. The developed models also incorporated aerosol and meteorological variables — including ultrafine particle size, temperature, and solar radiation that may exhibit collinearity with these gaseous oxidants. Comparing online with offline (filter) samples showed that filter-based OPFOX measurements were substantially underestimated. Therefore, the online FOX measurement provides a more accurate estimate of reactive oxygen species and may complement existing indicators used in epidemiological studies of photochemical air pollution."

 Ozone pollution has become an increasingly severe issue in North China. To address the challenges of insufficient prediction accuracy under high-concentration conditions and imbalanced sample distribution, this study proposes a hybrid model named EX-PIM-XGB(Extreme sample enhancement - Permutation Importance Method - Extreme Gradient Boosting), which integrates feature selection with extreme-sample augmentation for ozone forecasting. Using air quality and meteorological data from 79 monitoring stations during 2020–2024, the dataset was divided into four seasonal subsets—spring, summer, autumn, and winter—for model development. Results indicate that NO2 consistently exhibited high and stable importance across all seasons, with a maximum score of 2.78, followed by T2M and D2M, while UVB, CDIR, PM10,PM2.5 exhibited stronger seasonal variation. The R2 values of the spring, summer, autumn, and winter models were 0.90, 0.88, 0.93, and 0.86, and the RMSEs were 17.53, 19.93, 17.50, and 10.67. The enhanced model demonstrated significantly improved performance in high-concentration ranges; for instance, in summer, R2 increased from 0.79 to 0.90, RMSE decreased by 16%, and prediction accuracy improved by over 22%, outperforming both the conventional XGBoost model and the PIM-based variable selection model. These findings suggest that combining feature stability screening with extreme-sample augmentation effectively enhances the model's responsiveness to extreme pollution events, offering methodological insights and data-driven support for ozone pollution warning and control."

 The dynamical and microphysical processes that govern the lifecycle of hail-producing deep convective clouds (DCCs) remain poorly understood, limiting severe weather prediction. Here, we dissect a severe hailstorm that occurred over Inner Mongolia using multi-source observations, including Himawari-8 satellite data, Doppler radar, and a lightning mapping network. Our analysis reveals a tightly coupled co-evolution of cloud-top microphysical properties, cloud-top kinematics, and electrical activity. A key finding is the synchronization during rapid updraft intensification of a collapsing cloud-top effective radius (from ∼40 μm to ∼20 μm) with a surge in total lightning flash rate. Rapid updrafts likely shorten particle residence time, limiting particle growth while accelerating mixed-phase collisions and non-inductive charging, thereby promoting lightning jump activity. Critically, these abrupt changes in updraft velocity and lightning activity preceded surface hailfall and peak rainfall by approximately 30–40 min and 2 h, respectively. This study provides quantitative evidence that the integration of satellite, radar, and lightning observations can elucidate the microphysical pathways leading to severe convective weather and offers valuable lead time for improved nowcasting."

 Reductions in sulfate over recent years have increased the relative contributions of nitrate and ammonium to PM2.5 in Chinese megacities, shifting the focus of further PM abatement toward these semi-volatile species. This shift in focus makes understanding gas-particle partitioning, which is governed by aerosol pH and temperature, central to predicting their particle-phase contributions. Using hourly measurements of water-soluble inorganic ions (WSIIs) and related gases in Hong Kong and Shanghai, we constrained aerosol pH and aerosol water content (AWC) with ISORROPIA-II and evaluated PM2.5 mass sensitivity to total nitrate (TNO3 = HNO3 + NO3−) and total ammonia (TNH3 = NH3 + NH4+). In Hong Kong, sulfate dominated the WSIIs, whereas nitrate was dominant in Shanghai. The seasonally lower temperature (≈ 6–9 °C) in Shanghai, combined with a lower sulfate fraction, contributed to an aerosol pH approximately one unit higher than that in Hong Kong. The combination of higher pH and lower temperature in Shanghai favored particulate nitrate formation (high ε(NO3−)), increasing PM sensitivity to TNO3. Our quantitative sensitivity analysis showed that cutting TNO3 in Shanghai was as effective as cutting sulfate for PM2.5 reduction, while TNH3 controls required reductions of >40% to become effective. Consistent with its distinct chemical and meteorological regime, PM2.5 in Hong Kong was co-sensitive to both TNH3 and TNO3, indicating that a synergistic control strategy is optimal. Meteorology modulated these sensitivities primarily by altering aerosol pH and partitioning. Temperature exerted the strongest influence by directly controlling the thermodynamic equilibrium. High relative humidity favored greater aerosol water content, elevating aerosol pH and further promoting nitrate partitioning. Chemical composition, notably the sulfate and nitrate levels, also played a decisive role by setting the initial chemical regime. This contrast demonstrates that the lower temperatures and higher aerosol pH in Shanghai amplifies PM2.5 sensitivity to TNO3, warranting prioritized NOx control. In warmer Hong Kong, the lower aerosol pH and dominant role of sulfate result in co-sensitivity to both precursors, necessitating coordinated abatement. Thus, effective PM2.5 mitigation requires strategies tailored to local chemical-meteorological regimes."

 In the Asian monsoon region, October marks the transition from the wet to the dry season, during which precipitation variability plays a crucial role in regional water management and ecological stability. In recent decades, intensified climate warming has led to more frequent extreme precipitation events across Southwest China, posing substantial challenges to agriculture and economic development in the rain-fed Yunnan Province. Using long-term surface observations and ERA5 reanalysis data from 1961 to 2024, this study applies statistical and diagnostic analyses to identify the dominant physical drivers of October precipitation variability in Yunnan. The results show that the Western Tropical Pacific Moisture Anomaly Index (WTPAI) and mid-tropospheric relative humidity (RH) jointly regulate interannual precipitation changes. The positive influence of WTPAI on precipitation is subject to a humidity threshold near 49%, indicating that moisture anomalies amplify precipitation only under sufficiently moist conditions. Furthermore, the Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) primarily modulates WTPAI through its ridge position, linking large-scale circulation to regional moisture supply. Based on these findings, a “humidity threshold plus regional moisture anomaly” framework is proposed to describe the synergistic amplification mechanism between humidity and moisture transport. This framework clarifies the dynamic–thermodynamic coupling processes controlling autumn precipitation over Yunnan and provides a scientific basis for improved precipitation attribution, prediction, and water resource management under a warming climate."

 Convection-permitting simulations offer a promising approach for improving precipitation estimation in complex terrain, yet their added value and sensitivity to parameterizations remain poorly understood in the Yarlung Zangbo River basin. This study systematically intercompares fifteen 3-km WRF simulations to examine how parameterization choices (radiation, cloud microphysics, planetary boundary layer, shallow convection, and orographic drag) influence precipitation characteristics critical for hydrological applications: intensity, duration, frequency (IDF), maxima, and diurnal cycles. Results indicate that convection-permitting simulations add clear value by mitigating the “drizzle bias” typical of coarse-resolution models and by producing higher-intensity, shorter-duration events that better reflect the region's convective nature. While higher resolution improves event structure, the accuracy of mean precipitation depends strongly on parameterization. Sensitivity analysis reveals that cloud microphysics schemes primarily govern intensity, duration, and the timing of the diurnal peak, with the Thompson scheme best reproducing the nighttime peak observed in near-normal years. The planetary boundary layer scheme dominates precipitation frequency, with the MYNN2 scheme demonstrating robust performance across interannual variability. Comparisons with a convolutional neural network-based product and coarse-resolution reanalyses indicate that dynamical downscaling is more robust across interannual variability (dry versus wet years). Despite substantial uncertainty among satellite observational products, these findings show that optimized convection-permitting models capture realistic valley-scale gradients and diurnal propagation, providing essential guidance for hydrological modeling in complex terrain."

Brusko,Identification of a type 1 diabetes–associated T cell receptor repertoire signature from the human peripheral blood,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a T cell–mediated disease with a strong immunogenetic human leukocyte antigen (HLA) dependence. HLA allelic influence on the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire shapes thymic selection and controls activation of diabetogenic clones yet remains largely unresolved in T1D. We sequenced the circulating TCRβ chain repertoire from 2250 HLA-typed participants across three cross-sectional cohorts, including individuals with T1D and healthy related and unrelated controls. We found that HLA risk alleles show higher restriction of TCR repertoires in individuals with T1D. We leveraged deep learning to identify T1D-associated TCR subsequence motifs that were also observed in independent TCR cohorts residing in pancreas-draining lymph nodes of individuals with T1D. Collectively, our data demonstrate T1D-related TCR motif enrichment based on genetic risk, offering a potential metric for autoreactivity and groundwork for TCR-based diagnostics and therapeutics."

However, the choice of dielectrics is often restricted within the transparency window. We introduce object-driven engineering of the process of silicon-based dielectric materials for metasurfaces: visibly transparent hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) with a high refractive index of 3.48 and oxygen-doped a-Si:H (a-SiOx:H) exhibiting strong dispersion (Abbe number < 10). Both films are fabricated via chemical vapor deposition with precise control over atomic bonding and dopants, revealing the link between optical properties and the amorphous silicon network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of a-Si:H in metalenses with conversion efficiencies of 66.3, 92.0, and 97.0% at 450, 532, and 635 nanometers, respectively. In addition, a wavelength-decoupled a-SiOx:H beam-splitter achieves a 3.67-fold steering intensity contrast between 450 and 635 nanometers. These materials broaden the dielectric design space and enhance the performance of nanophotonic devices across the visible spectrum."

Bringing such systems far from equilibrium, however, can drastically enhance mode-to-mode interactions. Understanding the resulting liquid is a fundamental question for quantum statistical mechanics and a practical question for engineering driven quantum devices. To tackle this question, we probe the non-equilibrium kinetics of one-dimensional plasmons in a long chain of Josephson junctions. We introduce multimode spectroscopy to controllably study the departure from equilibrium, witnessing the evolution from pairwise coupling between plasma modes at weak driving to dramatic, high-order, cascaded couplings at strong driving. Scaling to many-mode drives, we stimulate interactions between hundreds of modes, resulting in near-continuum internal dynamics. Imaging the resulting non-equilibrium plasmon populations, we then resolve the nonlocal redistribution of energy in the response to a weak perturbation—an explicit verification of the emergence of a strongly interacting, non-equilibrium liquid of plasmons."

Microtubule cytoskeletal fibers offer an ideal system to test weak magnetic field effects due to their self-assembling capabilities, sensitivity to magnetic fields, and their central role in cellular processes. In this study, we use a combination of experiments and simulations to explore how nuclear spin dynamics affect microtubule polymerization by examining interactions between magnesium isotope substitution and weak magnetic fields. Our experiments reveal an isotope-dependent effect explicitly arising from nuclear spin properties. This nuclear spin-driven effect is enhanced under an applied weak 3-millitesla magnetic field. Our theoretical radical pair model achieves quantitative agreement with our experimental observations. These results support a connection between quantum spin dynamics and microtubule assembly, providing further insights into how weak magnetic fields may influence biomolecular functions."

Here, we identify elongation of very-long-chain fatty acid protein 6 (Elovl6) as a critical regulator in CRC progression. Clinical data reveal significant down-regulation of Elovl6 in colon cancer tissues, with low expression levels correlating with unfavorable patient prognosis. We demonstrate that Elovl6 exerts potent tumor-suppressive effects, significantly inhibiting cellular proliferation in vitro and attenuating tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, it maintains intestinal microbial homeostasis by preventing the expansion of opportunistic pathogens while simultaneously orchestrating metabolic reprogramming through modulation of phospholipid biosynthesis pathways. Notably, we find that stearic acid, a key Elovl6-derived metabolite, promotes mitochondrial fusion by stabilizing mitofusin 1 protein. These findings not only position Elovl6 as a promising therapeutic target but also suggest that dietary supplementation with stearic acid could represent a viable strategy for CRC prevention and treatment."

We demonstrate its biological potential in a glioblastoma model, where the simultaneous bidirectional modulation of five among the most deregulated microRNAs results in critical mass interference against the tumor. In parallel, microRNA-mediated chaperoning of an anti-p50 aptamer within the platform allows us to selectively block the nuclear factor κB pathway, a difficult-to-drug target.

Presynaptic diacylglycerol (DAG), Ca2+, and Ca2+-calmodulin signaling converge on the essential synaptic vesicle (SV) priming protein Munc13-1 via its regulatory C1, C2B, and CaM-binding domains. Using brainstem-specific heterozygous mice expressing a DAG-binding-deficient Munc13-1 variant (Munc13-1H567K), we compared synaptic transmission in situ at glutamatergic calyx of Held synapses carrying either a single Munc13-1H567Kor a single Munc13-1wtallele. Munc13-1H567K/−synapses show enhanced initial strength but impaired steady-state release and slower recovery from depression. These deficits result from an increased initial abundance of fully primed SVs and a loss of activity-dependent acceleration of SV priming. Posttetanic potentiation (PTP) is strongly reduced in Munc13-1H567K/−synapses and either increased or attenuated by C2B mutations that enhance or weaken Ca2+-phospholipid binding.

Subsequent automated synthesis and validation found a high-performance catalyst, TiFeNiZn-CoOOH, which exhibited an exceptional OER overpotential of 263 millivolts at 100 milliamperes per square centimeter. Feature importance and statistical analysis of more than 5 million structures confirmed that Zn consistently shows the highest active site occupation probability, and the [CoNiZn] coordination yields the lowest overpotential.

We found that genes within the IIS pathway evolved opposite roles in organ growth across wing-dimorphic insects, playing opposite roles in regulating the developmental switch between short and long wings. In the firebug, the InR-Chico-PI3K-PDK1-Tsc1/2-TORC1 cascade redirects the switch from short to long wings by inactivating IIS, whereas in the planthopper, the InR-Chico-PI3K-Akt-FoxO cascade redirects this same switch by activating IIS. Activation or inactivation of IIS results in low ecdysteroid titers in both species by regulating different genes within the ecdysteroid biosynthesis pathway, which in turn induces long wing development. Our findings reveal a negative relationship between IIS and organ growth and a mechanism for how a hormone pathway can translate opposing IIS activities into the same developmental switch across species."

Using this workflow, we identified the target specificities of T cells that are circulating in up to 14% of individuals, including a pre–COVID-19 seasonal coronavirus-reactive TCR that cross-reacts with peptides within pandemic coronaviruses; an influenza B–reactive TCR that targets a highly conserved epitope; and TCRs targeting Herpesviridae family viruses that cause long-term latent infections.

Electrophysiology shows that ivermectin activates GlyR even with strychnine present. Structures with both ligands reveal intermediate states featuring a desensitized TMD and an ECD between closed and desensitized conformations, providing insights into domain cooperativity and ligand efficacy. Molecular dynamics simulations show how ivermectin affects strychnine dynamics. These data support a model where ivermectin activates GlyRs through a concerted and near-symmetric TMD mechanism, whereas allosteric ECD motions are graded and spatially heterogeneous.

Herein, we extracted allomelanin from black knot fungus, chaga mushroom, and black oat using an acid-base extraction protocol, comparing them against a library of synthetic analogs derived from a range of putative, natural precursors. Spectroscopic analyses indicate that simple homopolymerization of 1,8-DHN does not adequately represent natural allomelanin structures. Instead, heterogeneous copolymerization of 1,8-DHN with catechol or tannic acid yields materials with physicochemical properties more consistent with natural extracts. This is also supported by their enhanced antioxidant and dye/metal adsorption properties. Like their synthetic counterparts, extracted natural allomelanins exhibit intrinsic porosity, reaching a Brunauer-Emmet-Teller area of 155 square meters per gram, potentially facilitating nutrient transport and toxin adsorption, although further studies will be required to probe this."

X-cut thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) is promising for developing next-generation microcomb-driven photonic systems, providing a diversity of functionalities through combinedχχ(3)and electro-optic effects. Normal-dispersion Kerr combs are critically needed because of their standout advantages, yet this dispersion regime remains unexplored on x-cut TFLN. Here, we design and demonstrate microresonators suitable for the robust generation of normal-dispersion Kerr combs. We show Kerr combs that substantially surpass state-of-the-art microcombs on x-cut TFLN in key performance metrics and an ultrabroad frequency comb whose existence is underpinned by both normal-dispersion Kerr dynamics and stimulated Raman scattering. Our work will unlock high-speed and low-energy-consumption photonic circuits for communications and signal processing enabled by a monolithic microcomb technology while also stimulating investigations of previously unknown nonlinear states that may synergize hybrid material nonlinearities."

Feng,Gigahertz multimode vibrations in graphene and MoS2 nanomechanical resonators at room temperature,"Probing and understanding ultrahigh-frequency/gigahertz (UHF/GHz) vibrations in atomic layer nanomechanical resonators holds strong promise for fundamental studies and technological applications, such as sensing, signal processing, and quantum engineering. However, accessing GHz flexural-mode resonances in such devices at room temperature has been challenging. Here, we demonstrate the first measurement of GHz flexural vibrations in graphene and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) resonators at room temperature, achieving multimode resonances (fm,n) up to ~1.09 GHz and quality factors (Qm,n) up to ~5400 in multilayer MoS2resonators, andfm,nup to ~1.03 GHz with highQm,n~4500 in few-layer graphene resonators. Bothfs andQs are the highest among reported atomic layer nanomechanical resonators at room temperature, yieldingfm,n×Qm,n~ 5 × 1012Hz. We also reveal aQscaling law with higher modes, which favors detecting GHz resonances. This study will enable exploiting multiple modes in atomic layer resonators toward resonant sensing and transduction functions at UHF/GHz."

Santamaria and Magali Irla,Age-related thymic involution: Mechanistic insights and rejuvenating approaches to restore immune function,"The gradual decline in thymic function with age, known as age-related thymic involution, leads to reduced T cell production, thereby increasing the risk of infections and cancer susceptibility and leading to poor vaccine responses. Moreover, T cell defects were recently involved in the age-related loss of tissue integrity and function. Mechanistically, thymic involution is driven by several factors, including hormonal modifications and chronic inflammation, leading to functional changes in the hematopoietic and stromal compartments. These progressive changes alter the cross-talk between developing T cells and thymic epithelial cells, which is pivotal for thymic function. Promising strategies to counteract thymic involution and rejuvenate immune T cell function have been recently identified. This review summarizes key insights into the underlying mechanisms of thymic involution and discusses current and emerging rejuvenation strategies to restore thymic function. These interventions show promise in regenerative medicine to promote healthy aging by alleviating age-associated immune decline."
