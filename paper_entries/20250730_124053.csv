Until now, radiocarbon dating of basal peats has been limited to 14 samples with poor spatial coverage, and suggested that peat typically initiated during the Holocene. We present 38 new basal dates, improving spatial coverage across the region. Some of the new basal dates are much older than any previous dates, indicating that peat initiated in the central Congo Basin at multiple locations in the Late Pleistocene. Our oldest basal date is 42 300 (41 200–43 800) calibrated years before present, making this one of the world’s oldest extant tropical peatlands, and twice as old as previously believed. The temporal distribution of basal dates suggests that changing climatic wetness has played a role in peat initiation in the region; numerous basal dates correspond with climatically wet phases, whilst few basal dates correspond with dry phases such as the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Today we find the central Congo Basin peatlands on wide interfluves between rivers, and on floodplains (mostly of the dendritic left-bank tributaries of the Congo River). We find the oldest basal dates on the floodplains of these left-bank tributaries, indicating a surprisingly high degree of channel stability over many millennia. This contrasts with, for example, peatlands on Amazonian floodplains, which are typically just a few thousand years old. The persistence of peat in the central Congo Basin since before the LGM, likely the most climatically dry period during the last 42 000 yr in this region, suggests that these areas may have played an important biogeographical role as forest refugia during glacial-interglacial cycles."
10.5194/acp-25-8107-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要探讨了亚洲夏季风期间，二氯甲烷（CH2Cl2）如何从地表输送到亚北极地区的对流层上部。研究利用2023年PHILEAS飞机观测活动的数据，结合FLEXPART拉格朗日粒子扩散模型，分析了高浓度CH2Cl2事件的来源和传输路径，以及进入平流层的可能性。研究结果表明，东亚夏季风是向对流层顶区域输送不受控制的短寿命含氯物质（Cl-VSLSs）的主要途径，尽管直接进入平流层的比例较小，但仍可能增加对流层背景水平。虽然该研究没有直接使用卫星观测或遥感技术，但它关注大气成分的传输和分布，以及与空气质量相关的污染物，因此与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测和大气成分分析）间接相关。,"['CH2Cl2', 'Asian Summer Monsoon', 'Upper Troposphere', 'Troposphere-Stratosphere Transport', 'Air Quality Monitoring (indirectly)', 'Atmospheric Composition Analysis', 'Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Model']",Markus Jesswein;Valentin Lauther;Nicolas Emig;Peter Hoor;Timo Keber;Hans-Christoph Lachnitt;Linda Ort;Tanja Schuck;Johannes Strobel;Ronja Van Luijt;C. Michael Volk;Franziska Weyland;Andreas Engel,Tracing elevated abundance of CH2Cl2 in the subarctic upper troposphere to the Asian Summer Monsoon,"The study investigates transport within the Asian Summer Monsoon, focusing on how CH2Cl2 reaches the subarctic tropopause region. Using data from the PHILEAS campaign in 2023, events with increased mixing ratios were detected. Their origin, the transport paths to the tropopause region, and the potential entry into the stratosphere were analyzed. The East Asian Summer Monsoon was identified as the main transport pathway, with only a small contribution to the stratosphere in the following days. 
 The Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM) is a seasonal weather pattern characterized by heavy rains and winds, mainly affecting South and Southeast Asia during the summer months. The deep convection within the ASM is an important transport process for pollutants from the planetary boundary layer up to the tropopause region. This study uses in situ observations of CH2Cl2 from the PHILEAS (Probing High Latitude Export of Air from the Asian Summer Monsoon)  aircraft campaign in late summer 2023 to examine the transport pathways and timescales for polluted air from the ASM to the extratropical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). CH2Cl2 mixing ratios of up to 300 ppt (≈ 500 % of the Northern Hemisphere background) were measured in the upper troposphere in the subarctic region. The three largest observed pollution events were analyzed with the help of the Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART, both in terms of their origin and their potential entry into the lower stratosphere. The results show that the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) is the key pathway for transporting uncontrolled short-lived chlorinated substances (Cl-VSLSs) into the tropopause region, which contributes to an increase in tropospheric background levels with the potential to enter the lower stratosphere. The transport analysis of elevated mixing ratios shown here suggests that transport to the upper troposphere in the subarctic region did not occur through transport into the Asian Summer Monsoon Anticyclone (ASMA) with subsequent eddy-shedding events but rather by large convective transport contributions from the EASM. The projected entry into the lower stratosphere in the following days amounts to a few percent, indicating that the direct influence of these particular events on the lower stratosphere is probably minor."

Turner;Maria P. Cadeddu;Julia M. Simonson;Timothy J. Wagner,Propagating information content: an example with advection,"When deriving a geophysical variable from remote sensors, the uncertainty and information content are critical. The latter quantify specifies what fraction of a real perturbation would be observed in the derived variable. This paper outlines, for the first time, a methodology for propagating the information content from multiple remote sensors into a derived product using horizontal advection as an example. 
 The mathematical algorithm to derive geophysical information from remote sensing observations is called a retrieval. The mathematics of many retrieval problems are ill-posed, and thus a priori information is used to help constrain the derived geophysical variable to realistic values. One quantity of interest, therefore, is the information content of the observation. Perfect information content in the observation would be achieved if the retrieval were able to capture any perturbation in the desired geophysical variable with the proper magnitude.Many new data products can be derived by combining geophysical variables retrieved from multiple different remote sensors. This paper explores, for the first time, how to derive the information content of these derived products. The approach uses traditional error propagation techniques to derive the uncertainty of the derived field twice, both when the observations are used in the retrieval and also when only the a priori information from each remote sensor is propagated. These two uncertainties are then used to provide an estimate of the information content of the derived geophysical variable.This study demonstrates how to propagate the uncertainties from six different instruments to provide the information content for water vapor and temperature advection.  A multi-month analysis demonstrates that, in a mean sense, the information content for temperature advection is nearly unity for all heights below 700 m while, the information content for water vapor advection is somewhat more variable but still larger than 0.6 in the convective boundary layer."

It was compiled from seven government datasets and quality controlled. This dataset will aid research on the causes and effects of wildfire in a changing world. 
 Wildfire regimes of the western United States (US) have changed dramatically since the 1980s but our understanding of the causes and effects of these changes is limited by a lack of a quality-controlled, publicly available database of wildfire events that (1) spans from the 1980s to present, (2) represents wildfires across a wide range of sizes, and (3) includes mapped fire perimeters and the area burned within. Here we present an updated and improved Western US MTBS-Interagency database (WUMI2024a) of wildfire occurrences, perimeters, and burned-area maps, covering the period 1984–2024 and the geographic domain of the 11 westernmost states in the contiguous US. The database represents 22,464 wildfires ≥1 km2 in size, which we 10,300 wildfires), the maps of fire perimeters and area burned are based on 30-m satellite data provided by the US government’s Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) project, allowing our mapping and assessments of total area burned to account for unburned areas within fire boundaries. For another 24 % of fires, our database includes perimeter observations provided by non-MTBS sources, meaning that only 30 % of fire occurrences are without perimeter observations. For these fires we tentatively assume perimeters are circular centred on the ignition location. Fires without perimeter observations are compile by merging seven publicly available government databases. For over 46 % of wildfires in our database (more than relatively small and over 95 % of area burned in the database is associated with fires with observed perimeters. The fire perimeters and burned area maps will aid assessment of the landcover types that burn and can be used to improve simulations of how historical fires have affected ecosystems and smoke emissions.

The Transformer model showed the best performance, leading to the development of the Transformer_CNN model, which combines global and local attention mechanisms. Results show that Transformer_CNN outperforms the other models and was successfully applied to interpolate heat flux data from 2007 to 2016. 
 This paper evaluates the performances of mean diurnal variation (MDV), nonlinear regression (NR), lookup tables (LUTs), support vector regression (SVR), k-nearest neighbors (KNNs), gradient boosting (XGBoost), long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent units (GRUs), and the Transformer model with a deep self-attention mechanism to interpolate the turbulent heat fluxes missing from a prairie observation on the Tibetan Plateau. Results indicated that the Transformer model outperformed the other methods that were tested. To further enhance the interpolation accuracy, a combined model of Transformer and a convolutional neural network (CNN), termed Transformer_CNN, was proposed. Herein, while Transformer focused primarily on global attention, the convolution operations in the CNN provided the model with local attention. Experimental outcomes revealed that the interpolations from Transformer_CNN surpassed the traditional single artificial intelligence model approaches. The coefficient of determination (R2) reached 0.95 in the sensible heat flux test set and 0.90 in the latent heat flux test set, thereby confirming the applicability of the Transformer_CNN model for data interpolation of turbulent heat flux on the Tibetan Plateau. Ultimately, the turbulent heat flux observational database from 2007 to 2016 at the station was imputed using the Transformer_CNN model."

Ruby Leung;Yilin Fang;Teklu Tesfa;Robinson Negron-Juarez,Representing lateral groundwater flow from  land to river in Earth system models,"Understanding horizontal groundwater flow is important for understanding how water moves through the ground. Current climate models often simplify this process because they do not have information about the land surface that is detailed enough. Our study developed a new model that divides the land surface into hillslopes to better represent how groundwater flows. This model can help improve predictions of water availability and how it affects ecosystems. 
 Lateral groundwater flow (LGF) is an important hydrologic process in controlling water table dynamics. Due to the relatively coarse spatial resolutions of land surface models, the representation of this process is often overlooked or overly simplified. In this study, we developed a hillslope-based lateral groundwater flow model. Specifically, we first developed a hillslope definition model based on an existing watershed delineation model to represent the subgrid spatial variability in topography. Building upon this hillslope definition, we then developed a physical-based lateral groundwater flow using Darcy’s equation. This model explicitly considers the relationships between the groundwater table along the hillslope and the river water table levels. We coupled this intra-grid model to the land component (E3SM Land Model: ELM) and river component (MOdel for Scale Adaptive River Transport: MOSART) of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM). We tested both the hillslope definition model and the lateral groundwater flow model and performed sensitivity experiments using different configurations. Simulations for a single grid cell at 0.5°×0.5° within the Amazon basin show that the definition of hillslope is the key to modeling lateral flow processes and the runoff partition between surface and subsurface can be dramatically changed using the hillslope approach. Although our method provides a pathway to improve the lateral flow process, future improvements are needed to better capture the subgrid structure to account for the spatial variability in hillslopes within the simulated grid of land surface models."

H. van Stratum;Hugo Denier van der Gon;Jordi Vilà-Guerau de Arellano;Sander Houweling,Carbon dioxide plume dispersion simulated at the hectometer scale using DALES: model formulation and observational evaluation,"We introduce a new simulation platform based on the Dutch Atmospheric Large-Eddy Simulation (DALES) to simulate carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their dispersion in turbulent environments at a hectometer resolution. This model incorporates both anthropogenic emission inventories and online ecosystem fluxes. Simulation results for the main urban area in the Netherlands demonstrate the strong potential of DALES to improve CO2 emission modeling and to support mitigation strategies. 
 Developing effective global strategies for climate mitigation requires an independent assessment of the greenhouse gas emission inventory at the urban scale. In the framework of the Dutch Ruisdael Observatory infrastructure project, we have enhanced the Dutch Atmospheric Large-Eddy-Simulation (DALES) model to simulate carbon dioxide (CO2) plume emission and three-dimensional dispersion within the turbulent boundary layer. The unique ability to explicitly resolve turbulent structures a the hectometer resolution (100 m) makes DALES particularly suitable for detailed realistic simulations of both singular high-emitting point sources and urban emissions, aligning with the goals of Ruisdael Observatory. The model setup involves a high-resolution simulation (100 m × 100 m) covering the main urban area of the Netherlands (51.5–52.5° N, 3.75–6.45° E). The model integrates meteorological forcing from the HARMONIE-AROME weather forecasting model, background CO2 levels from the CAMS reanalysis, and point source emissions and downscaled area emissions derived from the 1 km × 1 km emission inventory from the national registry. The latter are prepared using a sector-specific downscaling workflow, covering major emission categories. Biogenic CO2 exchanges from grasslands and forests are interactively included in the hectometer calculations within the heterogeneous land–surface model of DALES. Our evaluation strategy is twofold, comparing DALES simulations with (i) the state-of-the art LOTOS-EUROS model simulations and (ii) Ruisdael surface observations of the urban background in the Rotterdam area at Westmaas and Slufter and in situ rural Cabauw tower measurements. Our comprehensive statistical analysis confirmed the effectiveness of DALES at modeling the urban-scale CO2 emission distribution and plume dispersion under turbulent conditions but also revealed potential limitations and areas for further improvement. Thus, our new model framework provides valuable insights into the role of anthropogenic and biogenic contributions to local CO2 levels, as well as the transport and dispersion of CO2 emissions. This supports emission uncertainty reduction using atmospheric measurements and contributes to the development of effective regional climate mitigation strategies."

Time-parallel algorithms calculate the system state (e.g. the atmosphere) at multiple times simultaneously and have exciting potential but are tricky to implement and still require development. We have developed software to simplify implementing and testing the ParaDiag algorithm on supercomputers. We show that for some atmospheric problems it can enable faster or more accurate solutions than traditional techniques. 
 Modern high-performance computers are massively parallel; for many partial differential equation applications spatial parallelism saturates long before the computer's capability is reached. Parallel-in-time methods enable further speedup beyond spatial saturation by solving multiple time steps simultaneously to expose additional parallelism. ParaDiag is a particular approach to parallel-in-time methods based on preconditioning the simultaneous time step system with a perturbation that allows block diagonalisation via a Fourier transform in time. In this article, we introduce asQ, a new library for implementing ParaDiag parallel-in-time methods, with a focus on applications in the geosciences, especially weather and climate. asQ is built on Firedrake, a library for the automated solution of finite element models, and the PETSc library of scalable linear and nonlinear solvers. This enables asQ to build ParaDiag solvers for general finite element models and provide a range of solution strategies, making testing a wide array of problems straightforward. We use a quasi-Newton formulation that encompasses a range of ParaDiag methods and expose building blocks for constructing more complex methods. The performance and flexibility of asQ is demonstrated on a hierarchy of linear and nonlinear atmospheric flow models. We show that ParaDiag can offer promising speedups and that asQ is a productive testbed for further developing these methods."

Microplastics can release carbon-based compounds that serve as potential substrates for soil heterotrophic microbes. The impact of this novel microplastic-derived dissolved organic matter (MP-DOM) on soil carbon cycling and the underlying mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Here, short-term soil microcosm experiments were conducted with MP-DOM sourced from pristine and aged microplastics to compare their effects on soil carbon respiration against natural dissolved organic matter (NOM). The underlying mechanisms are investigated by estimating the spectroscopic and molecular signatures of MP-DOM and NOM, and comparing their effects on soil microbial physiological properties. Our findings reveal that MP-DOM leads to 36.9–42.3% higher CO2 emissions from soils than NOM, attributed to its greater bioavailability. MP-DOM simultaneously stimulates greater microbial quantity, phenotypic activities, and carbon utilization efficiency because this carbon is more biochemically accessible than NOM.

These PFAS contain ether or thioether linkages and are transformation products of an alternative PFAS surfactant. A modified version of the static headspace method with variable headspace/solution ratios was used to determine the dimensionless air/water partition coefficients (Kaw) over a wide range of temperatures (25–80 °C). The samples were analyzed through the aqueous phase instead of the headspace because of their relatively low volatility. The obtained log Kaw values of the tested chemicals ranged from −2.6 to −1.0 at 25 °C. No differences in Kaw were observed between ether and thioether congeners with the same perfluorinated carbon chain length. Increasing the length of the perfluorinated carbon chain from CF3- to C3F7- increased Kaw by about 1.5 log units. The obtained Kaw of a well-studied fluorotelomer alcohol, 4:2 FTOH, matched those of previous studies, indicating the appropriateness of the method used. The temperature dependence of Kaw, as quantified by the molar internal energy change of air–water partitioning, ΔU, ranged from 20 to 37 kJ/mol and was not substantially influenced by the structure of the chemicals. Among five in silico tools to predict air–water partitioning, the quantum chemistry-based COSMOtherm ensured the most reliable and accurate prediction as compared to the experimental results."

Therefore, exposure trajectories were constructed by using urine concentrations of phthalates at different times. Similarly, 3220 children were screened for symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and emotional and behavioral problems (EBPs) via multiple measures between the ages of 1.5 and 6 years. We also explored potential biological mechanisms through the metabonomics of cord blood. The results showed that high MMP during pregnancy was positively associated with autistic traits in all children (OR: 2.09, 95%CI: 1.10, 4.00) and boys (OR: 2.47, 95%CI: 1.08, 5.63). High LMWP (OR: 3.43, 95%CI: 1.15, 10.20), DEHP (OR: 3.24, 95%CI: 1.08, 9.69), or all phthalates (OR: 4.87, 95%CI: 1.48, 16.05) increased the probability of the occurrence of autistic traits. High MBP exposure in late pregnancy slightly increased the incidence of ADHD (OR: 1.61, 95%CI: 0.91, 2.85). High MBP (OR: 1.42, 95%CI: 1.02, 1.97) exposure increased the incidence of EBPs. Sex-specific associations were also observed. Mechanistically, phthalate exposure interfered with linoleic and arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism. In summary, longitudinal exposure to phthalates during pregnancy may increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) in children with sex-specificity. These findings may provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of phthalates affecting neurodevelopment."

Ma,Biogeochemical Pathways of Phytate-P Utilization in Soil: Plant and Microbial Strategies,"Phytate (salts of myo-inositol-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate) constitutes a large portion of the organic phosphorus in most soils, but its strong interactions with soil minerals and organic matter limit its availability to plants. Phytate can be used by plants only after it is desorbed from the soil matrix, with the inorganic P being released by phytases via cleavage of its phosphomonoester bonds. While plant phytases function primarily in its internal phytate remobilization, the role of microbial phytases in facilitating phytate-P utilization by plants remains poorly understood. This review focuses on phytase-producing plants and microbes and their uses in improving crop P acquisition from soil phytate. We discuss the behaviors of phytate and phytase in soils, especially their complex interactions with metal oxides, silicate minerals, and organic matter. Strategies to optimize soil phytase activity, including enzyme immobilization, site-directed mutagenesis, and rational protein design are also explored. Besides, we examine the mechanisms and hydrolysis pathways involved in phytase-mediated phytate hydrolysis, identifying situations where phytate utilization is limited by phytate solubility or phytase activity from an evolutionary perspective based on cultivation conditions and plant characteristics. Finally, we summarize strategies to increase plant utilization of soil phytate, including (1) amending soil with phytase-producing microbes, (2) expressing phytase gene in plant roots, (3) coupling phytase and organic acid exudation from plant roots, (4) intercropping phytase-producing plants with organic acid-secreting plants, and (5) incorporating phytase into plants with great organic acid production as cover crops. As these strategies are effective only in specific environments, future studies should focus on: (1) developing novel phytases with high activity and resistance to soil deactivation, (2) cultivating plants that effectively secrete phytase and mobilize soil phytate, and (3) engineering microbial consortia with stable and efficient phytate hydrolysis capabilities. Besides, integrated catalyst systems combining biological and chemical approaches also offer promising solutions for soil phytate hydrolysis. These strategies will exploit stable soil organic P by crop plants while simultaneously decreasing agricultural dependence on P fertilizer and reducing P loss to the environment."

This study quantifies the mitigation potential of FLM in China from 2025 to 2060, employing a tailored emission modeling framework and country-specific cost analysis. If unmitigated, these banked fluorocarbons could add 0.014 °C to global warming by midcentury. FLM, however, could prevent up to 8.0 Gt CO2-eq of cumulative emissions by 2060, with 93.2% attainable at costs below 10 USD/t CO2-eq─an additional mitigation exceeding 50% of the 13 Gt CO2-eq reductions pledged under the Kigali Amendment in China. Meanwhile, reclamation efforts could redirect up to 4108 kt of fluorocarbons for reuse or repurposing, conserving resources otherwise needed for virgin production.

However, traditional risk assessment methods for bioaccumulative pollutants to T&E fishes is challenging due to uncertainties in exposure-based toxicity relationships and data gaps. Tissue-residue concentration–response relationships provide a more reliable approach. This study employed machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict tissue-residue toxicity of bioaccumulative pollutants to T&E fishes, and found the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model performed best, with an external validation R2 of 0.85 and a root-mean-squared error of 0.81. It was then used to predict the developmental toxicity of 22 bioaccumulative flame retardants to 98 T&E fishes from the Yangtze River basin, across four life stages. Results showed embryonic and juvenile stages were most sensitive, with organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs), particularly (4-methylphenyl) diphenyl phosphate (CDPP) and isodecyl diphenyl phosphate (IDPP), exhibiting higher toxicity than novel brominated flame retardants (NBFRs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Ecological risk assessment for T&E fishes revealed that aryl-OPFRs posed the highest risks, with CDPP exhibiting a risk quotient (RQ = 4.07) four times higher than the safety threshold, significantly exceeding the risks associated with NBFRs and PBDEs.

We integrated environmental monitoring (356 pairs of house dust and urine samples collected across mainland China) with cell-based bioassays to investigate MEL exposure sources and toxic effects. MEL-related chemicals were frequently detected in dust (median: 10.3 μg/g) and urine (22.3 ng/mL) samples, indicating their widespread presence in indoor environments and chronic exposure among the Chinese population. Significant positive correlations were observed between MEL-related chemicals and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), a urinary biomarker of nephrotoxicity. RNA-sequencing of MEL-exposed human kidney-2 (HK-2) cells revealed significant enrichment of the ferroptosis signaling pathway. Further bioassays demonstrated that MEL exposure induces iron-driven mitochondrial lipid peroxidation in HK-2 cells. The system Xc–/GPX4, ACSL4, and TFR1/DMT1 pathways identified as potential targets in ferroptosis-mediated early renal injury in both acute toxicity experiments and chronic exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations. This finding was further supported by urinary malondialdehyde and Fe2+ levels that mediated 13–31% of the effect of MEL-related chemicals on NGAL in humans.

Limited information is available regarding their transformation via abiotic hydrolysis and photolysis at circumneutral pH, which are both key processes impacting the fate of these contaminants. Herein, we report that isoxaflutole hydrolyzes to diketonitrile with a half-life of 19 d at pH 7, which is 23-fold slower than prior modeling suggested. After correcting for hydrolysis, isoxaflutole was found to photolyze under simulated sunlight with a quantum yield of (1.56 ± 0.12) × 10–3, corresponding to a predicted near-surface half-life of 12 d under clear sky irradiance at 30 °N in summer, which was 2-fold slower than previously suggested. Diketonitrile, which does not hydrolyze, underwent slow photolysis despite significant absorbance within the solar spectrum, resulting in a quantum yield of (9.65 ± 1.54) × 10–6 and a modeled half-life of 150 d under the same conditions. Isoxaflutole photolysis primarily generated products other than diketonitrile, some of which were also susceptible to hydrolysis.

This study evaluated whether exposure of oxybenzone and dioxybenzone to human skin cell models formed analogous glucuronide conjugates and induced a reduction in cell viability under full-spectrum sunlight. In dose–response evaluations with two human skin cell models, increasing doses of oxybenzone or dioxybenzone (up to 0.1%) or increasing exposure times (up to 24 h) were associated with decreasing skin cell viability. Approximately 20–25% of both UV filters were metabolized to their corresponding glucuronide metabolites during permeation through the skin cell models. The masses of UV filters and their metabolites both were correlated with decreasing skin cell viability.

Although the importance of aqueous geochemical speciation is well recognized for U bioavailability after dissolved exposures, far less is known about the processes controlling U bioavailability after dietary exposures. This study characterizes the biogeochemical drivers of dietary U uptake in the freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis in laboratory experiments. Solids tested included benthic diatoms pre-exposed to dissolved U(VI), soils from contaminated U mine sites, and colloidal hydrous ferric oxide (HFO) synthesized in the presence of dissolved U(VI) or with U complexed by natural organic matter (NOM). Results showed that U was bioavailable from all solids. Uranium assimilation efficiency (AE), a proxy for dietary U bioavailability, varied among solids. AE was lowest for the U-contaminated soils (25 ± 17%) and highest for the U-laden diatoms (71 ± 13%). AE varied slightly among HFO preparations, suggesting modest influences of NOM and iron on U bioavailability. Increases in dietary U exposures reduced feeding rates, and the extent of feeding inhibition appeared inversely related to U bioavailability. The high U assimilation and range of bioavailability have implications for toxicity risks inferred without considering dietary uptake."

Fitting to experiments indicates that bulk-electrolyte ion transport in the NF membrane’s support layer (250 μm) dominates over active-layer ion transport (∼100 nm).

We unveil substantial differences in water-soluble Zn and Cd speciation and the OM molecular composition in various organic inputs. We found that plant-based organic inputs (e.g., green manures, lignified crop residues) were characterized by lower Zn and Cd concentrations and by enrichment in rapidly degradable OM. In contrast, animal-waste-based inputs (e.g., farmyard manures, composts) were characterized by relatively higher Zn and Cd concentrations and more degraded and resistant OM. Combining size exclusion chromatography coupled to atomic mass spectrometry with geochemical equilibrium modeling (WHAM VII) showed that water-soluble Zn in plant-based inputs was mostly bound to lower-molecular-weight OM while Cd was associated with higher-molecular-weight OM. This suggests potentially higher plant availability of water-soluble Zn compared to Cd. In contrast to plant-based inputs, the majority of animal-waste-based inputs showed water-soluble Zn and Cd primarily in the inorganic aqueous form (e.g., Zn2+, ZnOH+, Cd2+, CdOH+) and/or bound to higher-molecular-weight OM.

The recent discovery that the tire additive transformation product 6PPD-quinone (N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N′-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine-quinone) was primarily responsible for mortality in sentinel fish species has prompted regulatory and scientific scrutiny of tire additives as contaminants subject to widespread human and ecological exposure. Tire additives pose a global pollution challenge to human and ecosystem health due to their high emissions via tire wear particles  combined with loss from in-use and waste tire materials. Such releases often occur in close proximity to humans, and mobilized material or chemicals are easily transported to habitats where adverse effects are possible. This issue demands a commensurate policy response that remains unaddressed by existing pollution management policies. We here propose five principles for managing tire additives: mandating nonhazardous alternatives and their transformation products, acknowledging impacts throughout tire life cycles, transparency in tire compositions, characterizing effects, and international harmonization. Following these principles, we outline a Management Framework for Tire Additive Pollution (MF-TAP) that recommends a phased regulatory approach, data transparency, independent expert panels, and internationally coordinated governance to drive the development and use of alternative, nonhazardous tire additive compounds.

Our findings reveal that when the dynamical coupling strength between the atmosphere and ocean in the model varies seasonally, as observed, El Niño events tend to peak during boreal winter. The extent of this phase‐locking is influenced by the amplitude of the coupling strength seasonal cycle through the nonlinear frequency locking. In observations, El Niño peaks in winter because the coupling strength is highest in October and lowest in April. The time lag between the peak coupling strength and the peak El Niño magnitude is related to the amplitude of the seasonal cycle in the coupling strength. Furthermore, we found the higher coupling strength in the seasonal cycle may correspond to a higher ENSO growth rate by calculating the seasonal cycle of the model equilibriums."

The hygroscopicity parameter κ is widely employed in cloud condensation nuclei size range to indirectly infer organic mass fraction (forg) based on the κ‐forg linear relationship, but its associated uncertainties in such applications, especially for sub‐10 nm particles have not been fully constrained. Here, we first discussed the uncertainties of κ values by revisiting closure studies of κ derived from chemical composition (κchem), hygroscopic growth factor (κgf), and effective supersaturation (κSe). We then conducted a modeling and experiment study of exemplary substances to discuss the uncertainties from the κ dependence on particle size and thermodynamic models. The model‐predicted κ of four representative substances demonstrated significant size‐dependence and were compared to measured values in 3–8 nm. For ammonium sulfate (AS), the deviations of κSe retrieved by commonly used models varied from 2.5% for 3 nm and 41.2% for 300 nm, demonstrating significant size‐dependence of model prediction deviations, which may potentially introduce significant uncertainties in determining chemistry. We further evaluated mixtures of AS and cis‐pinonic acid. The relative differences in forg for AS‐organic mixtures reached 20.7% (model effect) and 41.4% (size effect). The estimated κ of pure organic particle exhibited relative variations of 22.7% (model effect) and 83.3% (size effect).

Here, we conducted a 2‐year field study in two subtropical forests (Evergreen Deciduous Broadleaf Mixed Forest, EDBF; Moso Bamboo Forest, MBF) to quantify soil H2 flux dynamics and their climatic and biotic drivers. Net H2 uptake dominated both forests, with annual sink strengths of −1.28 ± 0.13 and −1.23 ± 0.05 kg H2 ha−1 yr−1 for EDBF and MBF, respectively. Seasonal uptake peaked in summer and autumn, driven by temperature‐dependent microbial activity, but declined obviously during extreme precipitation events due to soil moisture‐induced diffusion limitations. Additionally, dry‐wet cycles enhanced nitrogen fixation, generating sporadic H2 emissions that partially offset microbial consumption. Litter layers reduced H2 uptake by 15%–31% seasonally, acting as both a diffusion barrier and a minor photolytic H2 source (transparent vs. opaque chambers: 8.05 ± 5.19 vs. 3.37 ± 3.36 μg m−2 h−1). This inhibitory is significant during dry days but not significant during wet days. Diurnal patterns showed 15% overestimation of daily uptake by daytime‐only sampling. Machine learning (XGBoost‐SHAP) identified precipitation, soil temperature, moisture, and total nitrogen as dominant flux drivers, with nonlinear or linear thresholds governing uptake level.

However, its effect on regional methane (CH4) emissions from paddy fields is unclear. Here we clarify the impacts of GM rotation by combining process‐based modeling with microbial gene abundance information and coordinated distributed observations at 14 sites in southern China. We found that GM management, including application rate and rotation year, mainly affects CH4 emissions in GM‐rice systems by impacting soil biotic factors, which explain 78.4% of the variation (p < 0.001). The most influential factor is the ratio of soil CH4 production to oxidation gene abundances (R2 = 0.510; p < 0.001), which decreases with GM rotation year due to increased activity of methane‐oxidizing soil microbes (p < 0.001), indicating that CH4 emissions from GM‐rice systems decrease with increased GM rotation year. By incorporating these microbial mechanisms as quantitative parameters in process‐based model, we project that approximately 76% of the paddy rice areas in southern China, which have relatively low GM biomass and baseline CH4 emissions, can achieve reductions in CH4 emissions through nearly 15 years of GM crop rotation. This study indicates that CH4 emissions from GM‐rice rotations with appropriate GM application rate over the long term will not significantly increase, resolving the contradictions in previous research."

Taking Yangtze River Delta as study area, this study quantified FS and WQS from 2000 to 2020, and explored their trade‐off and driving pathways at both county and regional scales. The results indicated that FS and WQS showed opposite spatial patterns, while both of them experienced significant declining trends across county and regional scales. Although both synergy potential and trade‐off intensity showed increasing trends, the mitigation of FS‐WQS trade‐off remained challenging due to the substantially greater rise in trade‐off intensity compared to synergy potential. “Win‐win” combinations were identified with high FS, high WQS and the lowest opportunity cost. Urbanization, especially urban expansion and population growth, significantly intensified the trade‐off by reducing food production while increasing demands for both food and water quality.

Previous studies have not adequately addressed the complex interplay between freight activity, commodity movements, and geographical distances in evaluating mitigation policies. Here, we developed a new distance‐based computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to address the freight costs between regions, enabling a detailed analysis of the spatial trade patterns, production relocation, and environmental impacts of different carbon tax scenarios on the freight sector. We found that a substantial carbon tax collection (700 CNY/ton CO2 by 2025) could reduce China's total freight turnover by 1.60% and cut industry‐wide CO2 emission by approximately 200 million tons (accounting for 1.8% of total CO2 emissions in China). The response to freight carbon tax varies with distance: longer bilateral trade distances experience a sharper decline in freight volume, while shorter intra‐provincial and neighboring interprovincial trade becomes more prosperous. Production activity tends to relocate to regions closer to customers and suppliers under the carbon tax, and each additional 1,000 km trade distance is associated with 0.3–1.2% reduction in provincial production. By integrating a spatial dimension into a CGE framework, our study elucidates how freight cost redistributes policy costs and benefits across regions, offering a more nuanced foundation for the design of targeted, regionally balanced carbon tax policies in China's freight decarbonization strategy."

While large language models (LLMs) have shown an impressive ability to aid researchers across diverse domains, their uses have been largely limited to answering specific scientific questions rather than performing open-ended research6–11. Here, we expand the capabilities of LLMs for science by introducing the Virtual Lab, an AI-human research collaboration to perform sophisticated, interdisciplinary science research.

 Anthropogenic climate warming is altering phenology—the biological timing of life-cycle events—across trophic levels worldwide. However, it remains unclear whether warming induces differential changes in phenology between plants and soil microorganisms—two fundamental components of terrestrial biodiversity and food chains. Here we report a consistent mismatch between plant and soil microbial phenology under climate warming, on the basis of 1,032 globally distributed observations of phenological shifts in plant and/or soil microbial respiration in response to experimental warming. Advances in spring phenology and delays in autumn phenology are greater in soil microorganisms than in both plant shoots and roots, particularly under tall vegetation (for example, forests) compared with low vegetation (for example, grasslands). Furthermore, phenology shifts in soil microorganisms are greater in soils with high carbon-to-nitrogen ratios, such as those in boreal regions, than in those with lower ratios. Such phenological mismatches between plants and soil microorganisms could destabilize their temporal synchrony, decoupling above- and belowground processes, and ultimately degrading energy flow and ecosystem functioning under climate warming.

In this study, the authors show that ongoing grazing could nearly offset climate-driven increases in soil carbon across the region by 2060. 
 Soil carbon stocks on the Tibetan Plateau are widely considered to be increasingly threatened by drastic climate warming and intensified livestock grazing. But it remains elusive due to unconstrained model projections. Here we integrate large-scale soil campaigns, soil incubation with paired grazing experiments to project impacts of climate change and grazing on soil carbon stocks in a three-pool soil carbon model. While Tibetan soils will act as a carbon sink, over half of the gains occur in active or unprotected pools, making them vulnerable to extreme events and grazing. Although thermokarst processes may not reverse this trend, continued livestock grazing at current levels, or even a transition to a forage-livestock balanced state, could nearly offset climate-induced benefits. We highlight the critical need to optimize grazing to sustain soil carbon sinks on the Tibetan Plateau, and emphasize the importance of incorporating grazing impacts on soil carbon stocks into Earth system models. The effects of climate change and livestock grazing on the Tibetan Plateau’s vast soil carbon stocks remain insufficiently understood.

 Chloroplasts are crucial players in immunity and photosynthesis. However, how chloroplasts arrange the transition between photosynthesis and immunity and how pathogens manipulate this transition remains elusive. Here we report an effector SsCm1 from Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, one of devastating phytopathogenic fungi, inhibits chloroplast immunity and resistance to pathogens, and alleviates photoinhibition in immune state. This is accomplished through stabilizing the conserved chloroplast protein MORF2, which is degraded during immunization and is a suppressor of photoinhibition, cell death, and chloroplast immunity. Overexpression of SsCm1 or MORF2 in plants represses basic immunity and resistance to pathogens, whereas deletion of SsCm1 reduces S. sclerotiorum virulence. Notably, SsCm1 possesses no chorismate mutase activity, which is different from the previously reported Cm effectors. This work reveals a strategy to fine-tune growth-defense balance in chloroplasts by manipulating MORF2, and a pathogenic strategy to subvert the process and promote infection via enzymatically nonfunctional effector stabilizing MORF2.

Although conventional antibiotics effectively inhibit or kill growing helical H. pylori, metabolically dormant coccoid forms of H. pylori exhibit considerable tolerance, posing a persistent and clinically significant challenge. Here, we report napabucasin (2-acetylfuro-1,4-naphthoquinone) as a redox-cycling antibiotic with potent bactericidal activity against both drug-resistant helical and coccoid forms of H. pylori. Notably, napabucasin does not induce acquired resistance in vitro and demonstrates superior efficacy compared to standard triple therapy in murine infection models. Mechanistic studies reveal that napabucasin acts through 2-oxoglutarate:acceptor oxidoreductase (OOR)-catalyzed futile redox cycling, generating bactericidal levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Compared to menaquinone 6, a proposed physiological electron acceptor, napabucasin exhibits enhanced oxidative capacity. Structural, biochemical, and microbiological analyses identify Leu44 and Lys46 within the OorD subunit as critical residues for napabucasin recognition and catalysis. These findings establish OOR-mediated redox cycling as a robust antimicrobial strategy that sustains endogenous ROS production to combat refractory H. pylori infections. This study identifies the compound napabucasin as a promising candidate against refractory Helicobacter pylori infections, demonstrating efficacy compared to standard triple therapy in murine infection models, and probing the mechanism of action."

In this study, the authors show how a key SARS-CoV-2 mutation, NSP4 T492I, is potentially responsible for accelerating genome evolution to develop adaptive variants (e.g. Omicron). 
 How SARS-CoV-2 Omicron evolved remains obscure. T492I, an Omicron-specific mutation encountered in SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4), enhances viral replication and alters nonstructural protein cleavage, inferring potentials to drive evolution. Through evolve-and-resequence experiments of SARS-CoV-2 wild-type (hCoV-19/USA/WA-CDC-02982585-001/2020, A) and Delta strains (B.1.617) with or without T492I, this study demonstrates that the NSP4 mutation T492I confers accelerated phenotypic adaption and a predisposition to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron-like variants. The T492I-driven evolution results in accelerated enhancement in viral replication, infectivity, immune evasion capacity, receptor-binding affinity and potential for cross-species transmission. Aside from elevated mutation rates and impact on deaminases, positive epistasis between T492I and adaptive mutations could potentially mechanistically facilitate the shifts in mutation spectra and indirectly determines the Omicron-predisposing evolution. These suggest a potentially important role of the driver mutation T492I in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants. Our findings highlight the existence and importance of mutation-driven predisposition in viral evolution. Drivers of viral evolution in SARS-CoV-2 are insufficiently understood.

 Senescent cells, characterized by irreversible cell cycle arrest and inflammatory factor secretion, promote various age-related pathologies. Senescent cells exhibit resistance to ferroptosis, a form of iron-dependent cell death; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we discovered that lysosomal acidity was crucial for lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis induction by cystine deprivation. In senescent cells, lysosomal alkalinization causes the aberrant retention of ferrous iron in lysosomes, resulting in resistance to ferroptosis. Treatment with the V-ATPase activator EN6 restored lysosomal acidity and ferroptosis sensitivity in senescent cells. A similar ferroptosis resistance mechanism involving lysosomal alkalinization was observed in pancreatic cancer cell lines. EN6 treatment prevented pancreatic cancer development in xenograft and Kras mutant mouse models. Our findings reveal a link between lysosomal dysfunction and the regulation of ferroptosis, suggesting a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of age-related diseases.

 Early-life acquisition of microbiota and, consequently, immune system development, both lastingly impacts health. Accordingly, we hypothesized that disturbing the microbiota of lactating mothers via consumption of dietary emulsifiers might alter the microbiota, and perhaps the immune system, of their offspring, thereby increasing susceptibility to microbiota-mediated diseases, including colitis and metabolic syndrome. Here we report that, in mice, maternal consumption of carboxymethylcellulose and polysorbate-80 resulted in transient alterations in offspring microbiotas that were necessary and sufficient to increase proneness to colitis and metabolic syndrome in young adulthood. Offspring microbiome alterations induced by maternal emulsifier consumption resulted in elevated levels of pro-inflammatory flagellin, bacterial encroachment, and premature closure of goblet cell associated antigens passages (GAPs). The latter event was linked to phenotypic outcome in that pharmacologically preventing GAP closure eliminated the detrimental of maternal emulsifier consumption. Collectively, these results illustrate the potential of dietary emulsifiers to drive transgenerational microbiota alteration and, consequently, hastened immune development that increases susceptibility to inflammatory diseases. Here, Delaroque et al. show that maternal intake of dietary emulsifiers alters offspring microbiota early in life, which, associated with perturbation of goblet cell function, promotes increased susceptibility to inflammatory diseases in adulthood."

Here the authors present synthetic nanofibre textiles that combine wearability, comfort, lightness and thermal insulation. 
 With a commitment to environmental protection, sustainable practices and ethical standards, there is compelling motivation to replace animal feathers and wool with synthetic materials that mimic the natural curl structure of animal fibres. However, the fabrication of these curved structures remains challenging due to inherent limitations in fibre spinning technologies. Here we develop a grid-induced homogeneous turbulence spinning system to efficiently spray the spinning solution, resulting in the mass production of highly curved nanofibres (HCNFs). A garment made with HCNFs offers excellent overall performance in terms of wearability, comfort, porosity (~99.60%), weight, thermal conductivity, moisture permeability and breathability. Furthermore, the garment exhibits a superior clothing insulation value (measured in CLO) of 0.31 CLO mm−1 at 0 °C, which is twice that of an 850-fill-power goose-down garment (0.15 CLO mm−1). Moreover, the results of a life cycle impact assessment demonstrate that HCNFs made of polyvinyl butyral show notable sustainability advantages over 850-fill-power down across 14 indicators, including mineral resource scarcity, land use, ecotoxicity, water consumption and human toxicity (eight indicators are less than 5% of those for down). Our findings not only underscore the advantages of nanofibres with highly curved structures but also introduce sustainable materials that outperform traditional down, making them suitable and sustainable for mass-market production.

Here the authors study the impact of recent regulatory restrictions on antibiotic use, in addition to climate and air pollution, on the beekeeping sector in Canada. 
 Antimicrobial resistance is a critical global health threat, significantly exacerbated by the overuse of antibiotics in agriculture. Here we investigate how recent antibiotic regulatory changes have impacted the usage of several level 2 (that is, World Health Organization ‘Watch’ list) antibiotics within the Canadian beekeeping sector. Utilizing national survey data, we examined trends in antibiotic usage and overwintering mortality rates from 2015 to 2023. Our findings reveal a significant reduction in the use of oxytetracycline, tylosin, lincomycin and fumagillin, decreasing from approximately 50% to 25% following regulatory restrictions implemented in 2018. Notably, this decrease was inversely associated with rising overwintering mortality rates, suggesting that withdrawal of antibiotics in the absence of effective alternatives may negatively impact colony health. Furthermore, multivariate analysis accounting for environmental confounders (based on 119,244 data points collected from 234 unique locations across Canada) identified nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a common air pollutant from diesel exhaust, as a strong predictor of mortality. This finding warrants urgent attention given that NO2 can degrade floral odours, rendering them undetectable to honeybees during foraging flights. These results highlight a complex interplay between antibiotic regulation, environmental stressors and honeybee health, emphasizing the need for comprehensive management strategies that mitigate antimicrobial resistance while safeguarding pollinator health.

In contrast, daily approximations tend to overestimate these trends by 5–10%, with combinations involving minimum relative humidity showing the largest divergences. Globally, up to 15 million km²—particularly in the western United States, southern Africa, and parts of Asia—exhibit significant overestimations.

Here we present a survey experiment conducted in China, Germany, India, and the UK, based on over 13,000 evaluations of policy designs. We examined four factors influencing public support: effectiveness in reducing emissions, impact on household costs, use of tax revenues, and international coordination. Communicating environmental effectiveness increased support, while making costs explicit reduced it. Preferences for revenue use varied: some respondents favoured direct payments, while others preferred investments in welfare. Contrary to expectations, only German respondents showed increased support when other countries also adopted similar measures.

 Vegetation dynamics, as fundamental terrestrial ecosystem components, regulate precipitation and evapotranspiration, directly affecting soil moisture (SM). However, global greening’s impact on SM (drying or wetting) remains uncertain. Here, we integrate multi-source satellite observations, reanalysis data, and outputs from 12 Earth System Models (ESMs) resampled to a unified resolution (0.25°) to quantify historical vegetation-SM couplings (1982–2020) and assess their future persistence (2015–2100). Results show 49.96% and 38.19% of global vegetated areas exhibit greening-drying patterns, driven primarily by vegetation transpiration, especially in grasslands and cultivated land (42-82% sensitivity). The ESMs predicted that soil dryness is exacerbated by vegetation greening and is expected to continue in the future. Despite uncertainties arising from discrepancies in model parameterizations in ESMs and the limited representation of regional-scale feedback across SM datasets, our study provides a robust and comprehensive assessment of the widespread impacts of global vegetation greening on soil drought. The findings highlight that SM carrying capacity must be prioritized in ecological restoration strategies—particularly in vulnerable semi-arid regions where greening intensifies soil drying (e.g., Central Asia, Central Africa, and southern Australia).

 Land carbon fluxes are key to the Paris Agreement. However, data comparability issues persist between countries’ land greenhouse gas inventories and mitigation targets, and what land models (bookkeeping and integrated assessments) provide as Paris-aligned benchmarks for land. As a result, the Global Stocktake, aiming to track collective mitigation progress, did not explicitly consider country targets for land. This blind spot leaves countries uninformed of the 2030 gap between their ambitions for mitigation on land and models’ benchmarks. Here we track the contribution and evolution of land-related targets under countries’ 2020 Nationally Determined Contributions, splitting land pledges between reduced emissions and additional sinks. Land retains a quarter of the global mitigation pledges in 2030, mostly relying on external support (−1.5ǂ1.1 GtCO2e/yr), of which −0.55 GtCO2e/yr are additional sinks. It is crucial that future Global Stocktakes include appropriate comparisons between modelled and country-provided land use net emissions. We here offer some concrete suggestions.

 Irrigation exerts a strong influence on carbon dynamics in agroecosystems. However, global patterns of soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil inorganic carbon (SIC) responses to irrigation remain insufficiently characterized. Here, we synthesized 223,593 observations to derive 2217 representative soil profile measurements and estimated the differential effects of irrigation on SOC and SIC. Our results show that soil carbon responses to irrigation vary with soil depth and are related to the amount of irrigation water applied. Specifically, SOC and SIC of cropland increased by 127% and 57.09%, respectively, under 200–300 mm irrigation compared to the reference study sites. In global upscaling experiments, we mapped the vulnerability distribution of SOC and SIC losses in irrigated cropland by applying a meta-forest model. We found that 54.58% of stable cropland areas were projected to experience SOC losses, and 60.22% were projected to experience SIC losses, under long-term continuous irrigation, with SIC at greater global risk. These findings highlight the need for strategic consideration of carbon sequestration potential in irrigation management to support climate adaptation efforts.

 Agricultural drought threatens food and water security in rapidly growing regions like India and Sub-Saharan Africa, underscoring the importance of remote sensing (RS) for monitoring. However, existing land surface temperature (LST)-based water stress indices often lack sensitivity to soil moisture (SM) deficits in vegetated areas, and high-resolution thermal infrared (TIR) water stress products remain scarce. Additionally, TIR-based indices are rarely validated with ground measurements in Sub-Saharan Africa, limiting their reliability.To address these challenges, we propose a high-resolution (70 m) soil moisture index using ECOSTRESS data, termed Radiative Thermal Inertia (RTI). RTI integrates near real-time noon and midnight ECOSTRESS LSTs with accumulated radiative fluxes, representing the energy required to raise LST by 1 K per unit area. A correction factor (β) accounts for vegetation cover and relative humidity, enhancing RTI's sensitivity to SM variabilities, especially in vegetated regions.First, we employ an innovative climatology-based LST reconstruction method to fill ECOSTRESS data gaps on missed clear-sky days using VIIRS LSTs, achieving accuracies comparable to official clear-sky retrievals (RMSE = 2.31 K at 13:30, 1.91 K at 01:30). These reconstructed LSTs are subsequently used to calculate RTI across 21 soil moisture in-situ sites in Sub-Saharan Africa and India, demonstrating a strong correlation [r = 0.62 for RTI-β] with seasonal SM variability compared to other indicators (Keetch-Byram Drought Index, KBDI; Normalized Difference Water Index, NDWI_ ρ1.24; NDWI_ ρ2.13; and Apparent Thermal Inertia, ATI). While the majority of the drought indices tend to saturate at high fractional vegetation cover (FVC), RTI-β remains stable across a range of vegetation densities. Sensitivity analysis with normalized SM anomalies shows a higher correlation with seasonality-detrended RTI-β (r = 0.70), marking a significant improvement in vegetated areas over the initial RTI and the Scaled Drought Condition Index (SDCI) in sparsely vegetated regions. Spatial and temporal analyses demonstrate the ability of this ECOSTRESS-based SM index to track drought periods and irrigation events. This study addresses a critical gap in high-resolution spatiotemporal surface water stress mapping for agriculture using thermal remote sensing theory. The findings highlight the RTI's potential for future high-resolution TIR missions, supporting agricultural management and drought early warning systems in Sub-Saharan Africa, India, and beyond."

 Land-surface phenology is critical to understanding Earth system responses to environmental change. However, there is a lack of studies that specifically examine Australian phenology trends over time periods long enough to robustly capture the effects of a changing climate. Here we utilise and demonstrate the methodological superiority of circular statistics for quantifying phenology in Australia. Next, we employ circular statistical methods across a long-term harmonised NDVI dataset (1982–2022) to analyse phenological trends across Australia's diverse landscapes. We find that forest ecosystems exhibit inertia to long-term shifts in rainfall regimes and increasing vapour pressure deficits, exhibiting stable growing season length, but increased maximum seasonal productivity (0.012 NDVI/decade). In contrast, shrublands and grasslands show significant phenological shifts, including earlier green-ups (−4.3 and − 2.0 days/decade, respectively), earlier senescence (−2.5 and − 1.7 days/decade), and earlier peaks (−2.5 and − 3.1 days/decade) linked to altered rainfall regimes and land use changes. Only modest increases in the length of season are observed because the start and end of seasons often advance simultaneously. Importantly, major cropping regions are experiencing shortened growing seasons (−3.5 days/decade), offset by increased maximum NDVI, stabilising productivity but raising concerns for future agricultural productivity. Increases in maximum NDVI are driving an amplification of Australia's vegetation cycles, with concomitant increases in rates of growth and senescence."

 Rapid advancements in ML have strongly boosted SAR research. Yet, ML applications in this field are constrained by the limited availability of valid SAR benchmark datasets. To address this gap, this paper proposes a standard framework for creating those. We introduce three categories for extracting SAR feature maps from SAR images and propose corresponding radarcoding methods to transform reference data into radar coordinates. The attribute quality of the generated SAR benchmark dataset is described using a local attribute table. It details the individual attributes of each SAR feature, while a global attribute table outlines the shared attributes across all SAR features. The quantitative quality of the dataset is assessed using quality control metrics. To facilitate online sharing and publication, the created SAR benchmark datasets are associated with using SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs (STAC). We applied our framework in land use and land cover (LULC) classification. We generated two benchmark datasets from three Sentinel-1A SAR images of Groningen, The Netherlands, one for ML application demonstration and one for quality comparison. To validate the applicability of our SAR benchmark dataset, we employed four well-established ML models: HRNet, Unet, PSPNet, and DeepLabv3＋. Additionally, we designed an artificial neural network (ANN) model to further improve the LULC classification performance.

 Geographical systems are inherently hierarchical, involving potential cross-scale interactions, as well as spatial dependencies and heterogeneities at each level of the geographic hierarchy. Capturing these interrelated effects within a unified model is essential for accurately reconstructing real-world spatiotemporal processes, yet remains a critical methodological challenge. Here we propose a novel Multi-Scale Spatio-temporal Statistical Modeling (M3SM) approach for analyzing spatio-temporal data with nested multi-scale structures. Built upon a multi-level modeling framework, M3SM naturally incorporates cross-scale interactions through appropriately designing randomly varying regression intercept and slope terms at multiple scales. Spatial dependencies and structured spatial heterogeneity at each spatial scale are captured using conditional autoregressive models, while temporal autoregressive processes capture stochastic dynamics. Despite its structural complexity, the implementation of M3SM is fully compatible with the established Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) computational ecosystem, enabling efficient approximate Bayesian inference. Simulation experiments confirm that M3SM can accurately recover spatial dependency and heterogeneity effects underlying true data generation processes. Applied to China’s air pollution data, M3SM identified significant effects of meteorological and anthropogenic factors. Crucially, it reveals that the effects of meteorological factors vary systematically across spatial scales—patterns that remain undetected unless spatial dependence and multi-scale structures are jointly modeled."

 Long-term, large-scale crop distribution mapping is crucial for agricultural policy and resource management. While high-resolution multispectral remote sensing has been widely used for crop type mapping, three major challenges remain: 1) spatiotemporal heterogeneity in cloud-free and shadow-free observations, 2) the lack of sufficient ground truth samples, and 3) limited generalization of identification models over extended periods. To address these challenges, this paper constructs a time-continuous sequence model that captures the unique feature pattern between the target-crop and non-target crops (referred to as the knowledge model). Specifically, a morphing approach was first employed to interpolate intermediate models between two pre-trained non-adjacent knowledge models. Then, a date-continuous sequence model that estimate the probabilistic of growth patterns of target crop was generated. This date-continuous sequence model mitigates spatiotemporal heterogeneity issues at the pixel level across large regions. Additionally, crop-specific knowledge model addresses sample scarcity and enhances generalization during long-term applications. The method was test using a long-term cotton mapping task (2000, 2005–2023) in Xinjiang, China. The results demonstrate that: 1) The sequence of knowledge model can effectively capture feature differences between cotton and non-cotton throughout the growing period, resulting in knowledge feature has a higher separability compared to original spectral and vegetation index features; 2) Segmenting knowledge features with Unet enables effective mapping cotton and non-cotton without ground samples. The estimated planting area from our mapping results shows excellent consistency with official statistics (R2 = 0.97). The correlation between our 2018–2021 results and previously published data reached 0.8, 0.88, 0.88, and 0.89. 3).

 The study of drought and precipitation evolution due to global warming has garnered significant attention from the scientific community in recent years. The Loess Plateau (LP), a typical dryland agricultural area, has its agricultural development influenced by precipitation. However, given its location in the hinterland of the Eurasian continent, the complex terrain, and the severe lack of rain gauges, the region faces challenges in accurate precipitation measurement. Multi-satellite precipitation products (MPPs), with their wide coverage and high resolution, can potentially address this deficiency, making it crucial to assess their applicability on the LP. This study evaluates the results of the inversion of LP precipitation changes by MPPs, the factors influencing the precipitation changes, and the dynamical mechanisms affecting LP precipitation evolution. The findings indicate that the CPC is the most suitable product for inverting daily precipitation on the LP, with the highest correlation coefficient of 0.774 between CPC and observations, and the highest Probability of Detection of 0.667. This is attributed to the stable data sources and excellent algorithms used by CPC. Furthermore, the LP has exhibited a significant upward trend in precipitation since 2000, with the thermal term playing a significant role in the humidification of the LP. The analysis suggests that global warming increases atmospheric moisture content, and enhanced westerly jet and near-surface easterly anomalies transport warm, humid air from the North Atlantic and the eastern China Sea into the LP. Clarifying the precipitation trends and dynamics in the LP can provide valuable policy support for agricultural development."

 The wheat powdery mildew (WPM) is one of the most severe crop diseases worldwide, affecting wheat growth and causing yield losses. The WPM was a bottom-up disease that caused the loss of cell integrity, leaf wilting, and canopy structure damage with these symptoms altering the crop’s functional traits (CFT) and canopy spectra. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based hyperspectral analysis became a mainstream method for WPM detection. However, the CFT changes experienced by infected wheats, the relationship between CFT and canopy spectra, and their role in WPM detection remained unclear, which might blur the understanding for the WPM infection. Therefore, this study aimed to propose a new method that considered the role of CFT for detecting WPM and estimating disease severity. The UAV hyperspectral data used in this study were collected from the Plant Protection Institute’s research demonstration base, Xinxiang city, China, covering a broad range of WPM severity (0–85 %) from 2022 to 2024. The potential of eight CFT [leaf structure parameter (N), leaf area index (LAI), chlorophyll a + b content (Cab), carotenoids (Car), Car/Cab, anthocyanins (Ant), canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) and average leaf angle (Deg)] obtained from a hybrid method combining a radiative transfer model and random forest (RF) and fifty-five narrow-band hyperspectral indices (NHI) was explored in WPM detection. Results indicated that N, Cab, Ant, Car, LAI, and CCC showed a decreasing trend with increasing disease severity, while Deg and Car/Cab exhibited the opposite pattern. There were marked differences between healthy samples and the two higher infection levels (moderate and severe infection) for Cab, Car, LAI, Deg, CCC, and Car/Cab. N and Ant only showed significant differences between the healthy samples and the highest infection level (severe infection). As Cab, Car, and Ant decreased, the spectral reflectance in the visible light region increased. The decrease in N and LAI was accompanied by a reduction in reflectance across the entire spectral range and the near-infrared area, which was exactly the opposite of Deg. The introduction of CFT greatly improved the accuracy of the WPM severity estimation model with R2 of 0.92. Features related to photosynthesis, pigment content, and canopy structure played a decisive role in estimating WPM severity. Also, results found that the feature importance showed a remarkable interchange as increasing disease levels. Using features that described canopy structure changes, such as optimized soil adjusted vegetation index, LAI, visible atmospherically resistant indices, and CCC, the mild infection stage of this disease was most easily distinguished from healthy samples. In contrast, most severe impacts of WPM were best characterized by features related to photosynthesis (e.g., photochemical reflectance index 515) and pigment content (e.g., normalized phaeophytinization index). This study help deepen the understanding of symptoms and spectral responses caused by WPM infection."

 Long-tailed class distributions pose a significant challenge in remote sensing scene recognition, where certain scene categories appear far less frequently than others. However, existing long-tailed learning approaches often overlook the unique spatial hierarchies and contextual semantic relationships inherent in remote sensing imagery, limiting their effectiveness in this domain. To address this, we propose Diversity-Mix Remote Sensing (DMRS), a foundation model-based framework designed for long-tailed remote sensing scene recognition. DMRS introduces two key innovations: (1) multi-low-rank adaptation diversity experts, which achieves balanced classification by specializing different experts for different regions of the class distribution, and (2) a semantic-aware mixing strategy, which incorporates textual semantic information typically unused in traditional classification to enhance perception across diverse remote sensing scenes. Extensive experiments on NWPU-RESISC45 and RSD46-WHU datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DMRS, achieving 6.7% and 2.0% improvements in overall accuracy, respectively, while significantly enhancing the recognition of tail classes.

Furthermore, we design an auxiliary task coordination module (ATCM) to balance these tasks and ensure effective feature fusion.

 Hexagonal Discrete Global Grid Systems (HDGGS) are spatial reference frameworks based on the spatial discretization of the Earth’s surface, dividing it into a network of uniform hexagonal cells. They have been widely applied in geospatial analysis and environmental science fields. However, the hexagonal cells are not perfectly uniform, exhibiting inevitable shape distortion and area deformation. This study proposes a neighbor distance standard deviation method to characterize the shape deformation of individual hexagonal cells, and introduces a global deformation index to assess overall distortion magnitude, thereby addressing the limitations of deformation analysis based solely on cell area and perimeter differences. Finally, we experimentally analyzed deformation characteristics across three hexagonal discrete global grid systems projection types: Fuller3H, Fuller4H, ISEA3H, ISEA4H, and Uber H3. The experimental results show that, compared with ISEA-projection-based HDGGS grids, the Fuller-projection-based HDGGS grids’ cell neighbor distance standard deviation, grid neighboring distance standard deviation, and global deformation index are 72.09 % to 76.12 %, 74.25 % to 81.92 %, and 72.25 % to 76.29 % of the former’s values, respectively. In comparison, the Gnomonic-projection-based HDGGS’s global deformation index is 55.28 % and 40.35 % of the previous two’s values, respectively. Therefore, Gnomonic-projection-based HDGGS demonstrates the least cell shape deformation and optimal equidistant characteristics. This study pioneers quantifying local distance consistency as standardized neighbor distance standard deviation, transcending conventional evaluation paradigms that solely rely on cell perimeter mean squared error or compactness. Experimental results confirm the method’s effectiveness in quantitatively evaluating HDGGS shape deformation, providing a decision-support tool for HDGGS projection type selection."

 Concentrations of PM2.5 (particulate matter smaller than 2.5 μm in diameter) vary depending on regional emissions and meteorological conditions. This study investigates the physical and chemical characteristics of PM2.5 and its formation mechanisms in Busan, a coastal megacity in Korea with significant port-related emissions. An increase in PM2.5 concentrations was associated with a rising proportion of nitrate (NO3−), highlighting the role of nitrate formation in elevated wintertime PM2.5 levels. Throughout the measurement period, an ammonium-rich environment persisted, with the molar ratio of excess-NH4+ to NO3− approaching 1:1, indicating that the formed nitrates were effectively neutralized by ammonium ions. In diurnal variations during high PM2.5 periods, the peak concentrations in PM2.5 occurred at night, closely following the daily maxima in relative humidity and aerosol liquid water content (ALWC). Moreover, case studies revealed that increases in relative and specific humidity preceded the augmentation of ALWC, coinciding with the growth of the major aerosol mode larger than 200 nm. This increase in ALWC likely facilitated the efficient conversion of nitrate into a condensed phase, promoting heterogeneous nitrate formation. Consequently, this nighttime heterogeneous formation of nitrate, driven by the increase in ALWC, plays a significant role in the formation of fine particulate matter in a coastal megacity of Korea during winter."

 The relative-rate technique has been used to obtain the rate coefficients for the reactions of the saturated aldehydes (SA): Octanal (OCT) CH3(CH2)6C(O)H and Nonanal (NON) CH3(CH2)7C(O)H with OH radicals and Cl atoms at (298 ± 3) K and atmospheric pressure. The experiments were performed in an environmental chamber using in situ FTIR spectroscopy detection to monitor the decay of the aldehydes relative to different reference compounds. The following room temperature rate coefficients (in units of cm3 molecule−1 s−1) were obtained: k1 (OH + CH3(CH2)6C(O)H) = (3.13 ± 0.50) × 10−11, k2 (Cl + CH3(CH2)6C(O)H) = (2.80 ± 0.31) ×10−10, k3 (OH + CH3(CH2)7C(O)H) = (2.81 ± 0.40) × 10−11 and k4 (Cl + CH3(CH2)7C(O)H) = (3.10 ± 0.30) × 10−10. In addition, product studies were performed in similar conditions of the kinetic experiments by the SPME-GC-MS technique. Heptanal, hepta-1-ol, octanoic acid, octanal, 1-octanol, octanoyl chloride, 1-chlorooctane and formaldehyde were identified as reaction products.The atmospheric implications of the studied reactions were assessed by the estimation of the tropospheric lifetimes of OCT and NON concerning their reaction with OH radicals and Cl atoms to be 9, 10 h and 30, 27 h, respectively. The relatively short residence in the atmosphere of the SA studied will have a local impact with restricted transport.

 To date, compared to traditional approaches to increasing crop yields, developing methods to mitigate ozone pollution has attracted less attention from policymakers toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) of Zero Hunger. In this study, using long-term model-simulated hourly ozone concentrations bias-corrected via machine learning, we estimated ozone-induced wheat production losses in China from 2005 to 2019. We further examined uncertainties in prior research arising from methodological variations and source-specific input fields. Four approaches – one concentration-based and three flux-based with different stomatal conductance formulations – were applied to evaluate the associated uncertainties within a unified modeling framework. Our results show that annual average production losses of wheat are 16.6–30.7 million metric tonnes (Mt yr−1) depending on the approach used, with nominal economic costs (ECs) amounting to 5.2–9.5 billion USD yr−1. National production losses of wheat exhibit an upward trend of +0.41–0.74 Mt yr−1 in parallel with rising wheat production. The annual nominal ECs show an upward trend ranging between +0.38 and + 0.69 billion USD yr−1, while inflation and exchange rate fluctuations exaggerate the trend of the real monetary losses by +0.17–0.39 billion USD yr−1 based on 2015 values. Henan, Shandong and Anhui provinces suffer the most severe losses with large volumes of wheat production. Among potential sources of uncertainty, fundamental methodological differences contribute the most to the combined large uncertainty. Particularly, inaccurate representation of regional crop genotypes and environmental conditions can lead to large biases regardless of the approach used. Therefore, future studies should prioritize approaches that incorporate regional specificity, such as refined model parameterization and dose-yield relationships. This study provides important scientific evidence that ozone pollution mitigation can greatly contribute to SDG 2, and offers valuable suggestions for further improving assessment approaches to enhance our understanding of air pollution impacts on food security."

 This study analyzed speciated PM2.5 data (2014–2024) from the Chemical Speciation Network in central Los Angeles and used positive matrix factorization (PMF) to identify and apportion sources, and quantified changes in their contributions over time to examine combined effects of regulatory actions, COVID-19 Lockdowns, and Wildfire Episodes over this period. Nine factors were identified, namely vehicular emissions, tire wear, mineral dust, fresh sea salt, aged sea salt + marine combustion, biomass burning, secondary nitrate, secondary sulfate, and secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Over the decade, mean gravimetric PM2.5 declined from 15.4 μg/m3 to 10.5 μg/m3 (−34 %), driven primarily by a statistically significant 47 % decrease in vehicular emissions (from 2.15 to 1.14 μg/m3), while secondary nitrate also declined by 61 % (from 5.57 to 2.17 μg/m3), though this trend was not statistically significant; secondary sulfate remained steady at 0.83–1.38 μg/m3. Considering the tightening of the annual PM2.5 standard to 9.0 μg/m3, central Los Angeles remains in nonattainment, underscoring the need for additional mitigation strategies to drive the annual mean below this revised threshold. Moreover, two significant perturbations interrupted these trends: stay-at-home orders (March–June 2020) suppressed vehicular and nitrate contributions by roughly 65 %, although meteorological conditions and data limitations might introduce some uncertainty, while the Bobcat Fire later in 2020 doubled the annual biomass-burning contribution to 3.64 μg/m3 (peaking at 6.78 μg/m3 in September) and raised SOA to 2.47 μg/m3. Collectively, the results highlight the interplay between sustained emission controls and natural events, offering guidance for adaptive air-quality management."

 The air-sea momentum flux is an important component in air-sea interactions. In climate models, the estimation of air-sea momentum flux mainly relies on bulk flux parameterization based on the Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory. However, the bulk flux parameterization has significant biases under light wind conditions. To reduce these inaccuracies, this study analyzed observational data from marine stations. The results showed that the non-local effects, which are overlooked by the traditional Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory, are a significant factor contributing to inaccuracies in the air-sea momentum flux parameterization. Based on this finding, this study proposed a modification equation associated with non-local effects to improve the parameterization of air-sea momentum flux under near-neutral conditions. Furthermore, the modification equation was extended to non-neutral conditions, enabling its integration into air-sea momentum flux parameterization schemes and climate models. To evaluate the applicability and effectiveness of this modification, offline and online tests were conducted using two observational datasets and the Community Atmosphere Model version 6. Assessed by the comprehensive evaluation metric DISO, it was demonstrated that the non-local effects modification evidently enhanced the calculation accuracy of air-sea momentum flux and significantly improves the simulation performance in climate models."

 Accurate precipitation data play a vital role in hydrological and climate studies, with their significance being especially pronounced in alpine cold regions where in-situ observational data are limited. However, existing gridded precipitation datasets often suffer from low resolution and significant biases, making them inadequate for addressing the strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity of alpine areas. To address these challenges, this study developed a novel Three-Layer Intelligent Downscaling and Calibration (TLIDC) framework, integrating Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and Convolutional Neural Network–Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-BiLSTM) model, to generate high-precision gridded precipitation data tailored for alpine regions.The TLIDC framework was quantitatively evaluated using data from 100 rain gauge stations in the Qilian Mountains and applied to reconstruct daily precipitation data at a 0.01° × 0.01° spatial resolution for the Qilian Mountains from 1950 to 2024. The results demonstrate that: (1) The TLIDC framework effectively downscales the coarse spatial resolution ERA5-Land precipitation data, producing high spatial resolution outputs that preserve the temporal periodicity and overall spatial distribution, while markedly enhancing spatial detail and visual clarity. (2) The calibration module of the TLIDC framework effectively corrected the bias in the raw precipitation data, significantly improving data performance, particularly in areas with scarce ground observation data. Compared to CHM_PRE, CN05.1, and TRMM, the generated data showed a 15.95 % ∼ 25.20 % improvement in precipitation event identification accuracy. Furthermore, the Pearson correlation coefficient (CC) for precipitation simulation accuracy increased by 0.30–0.55, while the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) decreased by 3.33–4.58 mm/day and 1.42–2.27 mm/day, respectively. (3) The high-precision precipitation dataset for the Qilian Mountains, reconstructed using the TLIDC framework, has a multi-year average of 296.84 mm/year for the period 1999–2019. This value is close to the multi-year averages of three other precipitation products, which range from 296.43 to 352.47 mm/year. Additionally, the spatial distribution pattern of this dataset aligns with those of the other products. (4) From 1950 to 2024, precipitation in the Qilian Mountains has increased at a linear rate of 2.49 mm per decade (p < 0.05), exhibiting a spatial pattern of decreasing precipitation from southeast to northwest. Our findings offer a viable solution for generating high-precision precipitation data in alpine cold regions with complex topography and sparse observational networks, addressing a critical gap in current climate and hydrological research."

 Identifying the key factors that influence atmospheric visibility is critical for effective air pollution prevention and control. However, the complex nonlinear relationships between visibility and its influencing factors pose significant challenges. Most current studies rely on empirical models for statistical analysis, which can introduce significant inaccuracies.This study integrates the traditional IMPROVE analysis method with machine learning models to investigate the driving factors of atmospheric visibility and the causes of low visibility events during the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou. The results indicate that SO42−, NO3−, organic aerosols (OA), and black carbon (BC) are the primary light extinction contributors among PM2.5 chemical components. Secondary formation processes were the dominant factor that accounted for 57 % of extinction coefficient, relative humidity and vehicles together contributed 30 % of extinction coefficient. During periods of low visibility (<10 km), the contributions of secondary nitrates and relative humidity content to extinction coefficient increased significantly, suggesting that hygroscopic growth of secondary nitrates was the primary driver of such events.The results of the study show that machine learning models closely match the IMPROVE approach during periods of low visibility. In addition, machine learning models outperform the IMPROVE method in their ability to capture the complex non-linear relationships between forcing factors and visibility. To effectively manage secondary nitrate pollution, it is critical to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ammonia (NH3) while improving overall air quality. This comprehensive analytical approach provides scientific evidence for improving urban atmospheric visibility."

 As Indonesia's new capital (hereafter called Nusantara City or NC) aspires to become a leading sustainable city, it must be developed with resilience to climate change. This study investigates the future seasonal extreme precipitation conditions in NC using a set of climate projections from the CORDEX-SEA Regional Climate Models (RCMs). The analysis integrates four Global Climate Models (GCMs) downscaled using two RCMs: RegCM4 and RCA4. The model results were analyzed for the periods 1970–2005 (historical), 2011–2040 (early century), 2041–2070 (mid-century), and 2071–2099 (late century) under both the low-emission (RCP 2.6) and high-emission (RCP 8.5) scenarios. Model evaluation using Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) Version 07B data shows that RegCM4-based downscaling more accurately captures mean rainfall, seasonal patterns, and extreme precipitation indices in NC than RCA4. The ensemble average of three RegCM4 runs (HadGEM2-ES, MPI-ESM-MR, and NorESM1) indicates significant increases in extreme precipitation indices under RCP 8.5 from the mid to late century. By the late century, indices such as Maximum 5-Day Precipitation (RX5days), Consecutive Dry Days (CDD), and Number of Very Heavy Precipitation Days (R50mm) are projected to increase by 5.88 %, 41.12 %, and 29.30 %, respectively, while Total Precipitation (PRPTOT), Consecutive Wet Days (CWD), and Number of Heavy Precipitation Days (R20mm) decrease by −15.69 %, −21.93 %, and − 13.78 %. Rainfall during the dry season (June–September) is projected to decline by approximately 17 % under RCP 2.6 and 25 % under RCP 8.5. Historically, El Niño has triggered droughts during the dry season in Kalimantan, and under future warming, severe droughts resembling those driven by El Niño may occur even in its absence. Furthermore, the divergent projections resulting from the various models employed here suggest the critical role of model selection in hydrological impact analysis, as different models can produce strongly divergent estimates of future extreme rainfall."
