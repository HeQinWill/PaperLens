10.5194/acp-25-12051-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了沙尘气溶胶对印度夏季风的影响，并着重研究了气候模型中由混沌效应引起的不确定性。论文通过大规模集合模拟和随机抽样算法，揭示了以往研究中被忽视的混沌效应对气溶胶气候影响模拟结果的影响。研究发现，虽然沙尘总体上增强了大规模夏季风环流，但其对区域系统的影响（如季风低压）表现出显著的混沌效应，导致不同集合成员模拟的降水结果差异很大，甚至相反。该研究强调了使用足够大的集合规模来捕捉气溶胶对区域气候的可靠物理影响的必要性。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术，但其对气溶胶（尤其是沙尘）的关注，以及对气候影响的分析，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）密切相关，因为这些技术可以用于监测和研究气溶胶的分布、传输和气候效应。,"['aerosols', 'dust', 'Indian summer monsoon', 'climate models', 'regional climate', 'ensemble simulations', 'precipitation']",Jiawang Feng;Chun Zhao;Jun Gu;Gudongze Li;Mingyue Xu;Shengfu Lin;Jie Feng,Dust impacts on the Indian summer monsoon:  chaotic or physical effect?,"Climate models help in the study of aerosol impacts on regional climate. However, the atmosphere's chaotic nature makes it hard to separate true aerosol impacts from chaotic effects. Our ensemble experiments show that while large-scale aerosol effects are consistent, regional aerosol impacts vary significantly among experiments. We give a formula showing the relationship between chaotic effects and ensemble sizes, emphasizing the necessity of adequate ensemble members to capture reliable aerosol impacts. 
 Aerosols have significant impacts on regional climate, which has been widely investigated with numerical experiments. However, the uncertainties of simulated aerosol impact due to the long-standing chaotic effect remain unclear. Here we propose a diagnostic method based on large ensemble simulations and a random sampling algorithm to unveil the chaos-induced uncertainties in simulated aerosol climatic impacts that have been overlooked in previous studies. Taking the dust impacts on the Indian summer monsoon system as a demonstration, our findings reveal that, while dust generally enhances the large-scale summer monsoon circulation consistently among ensemble members, its impacts on regional systems, such as monsoon depressions, exhibit significant chaotic effect: the simulated aerosol impacts on precipitation from individual ensemble members differ substantially, even inversely. Through quantitative analysis, we demonstrate that the magnitude of these chaotic effects diminishes following a N−½ relationship with ensemble size N. Furthermore, our results indicate that statistical significance testing alone may be insufficient for the robust attribution of dust impacts, as even small ensembles can yield statistically significant yet contradictory results. This study emphasizes the necessity of employing adequate ensemble sizes to capture reliable physical impacts of aerosol on the regional climate."
10.5194/acp-25-11919-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注北极地区冰核粒子（INPs）的来源和季节性变化，以及它们与空气中细菌和真菌等生物气溶胶的关系。研究旨在了解生物气溶胶如何影响北极云的形成和性质，从而预测未来的气候变化。虽然涉及大气成分，但侧重于生物来源的粒子，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）的直接关联性不强，更多的是关于生物气溶胶对北极气候的影响。,"['ice nucleating particles', 'bioaerosols', 'Arctic clouds', 'microbial communities']",Kevin R. Barry;Thomas C. J. Hill;Sonia M. Kreidenweis;Paul J. DeMott;Yutaka Tobo;Jessie M. Creamean,Bioaerosols as indicators of central  Arctic ice nucleating particle sources,"The Arctic is changing rapidly, and we sought to better understand how Arctic clouds may change in the future through quantifying the ice-forming particles over a year and uncovering what they are made of. We determined their likely sources through concurrent DNA sequencing of airborne bacteria and fungi and found persistent mixtures of local and longer-range sources at all times. 
 The Arctic is warming at a rapid rate, with implications for microbial communities as the ecosystems change. Some microbes and biogenic materials can affect the persistence of long-lived mixed-phase clouds by serving as ice nucleating particles (INPs). The presence of INPs modulates the cloud phase, and long-term measurements are important to elucidate their seasonal sources and to predict future change. The Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition in 2019–2020 provided the first year-long measurements of bioaerosols and INPs in the central Arctic, with 3 d filters for amplicon sequencing and cumulative INP concentrations from −5 to −30 °C. Here, we investigated the INP seasonal cycle and its relation to the seasonal cycle of bacteria and eukaryotes. INPs were greatly elevated and compositionally similar in summer, aligning with a greater prevalence of local bioaerosol sources, but, despite this, a diverse mixture of sources (marine and terrestrial) was present all times. A common broader Arctic INP population is hypothesized for much of the year by comparable coincident data collected in Svalbard and a sensitivity of both the INPs and bioaerosols to large-scale events."
10.5194/acp-25-11991-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注平流层积云对气候变化预测的影响，特别是对区域气候变化模式和环流变化的影响。它探讨了云反馈在气候模型中的重要性，以及模型中云的表征不准确如何影响气候变化预测。虽然该研究与大气有关，但它侧重于气候建模和预测，而不是直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。因此，它与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强。,"['climate change projections', 'low-level clouds', 'stratocumulus clouds', 'climate models', 'radiative feedback', 'sea surface temperature', 'Walker circulation']",Philipp Breul;Paulo Ceppi;Peer Nowack,The importance of stratocumulus clouds for projected warming patterns and circulation changes,"We explore how Pacific low-level clouds influence projections of regional climate change by adjusting a climate model to enhance low-cloud response to surface temperatures. We find significant changes in projected warming patterns and circulation changes under increased CO2 conditions. Our findings are supported by similar relationships across state-of-the-art climate models. These results highlight the importance of accurately representing clouds for predicting regional climate change impacts. 
 Stratocumulus clouds are thought to exert a strong positive radiative feedback on climate change, but recent analyses suggest that this feedback is widely under-represented in global climate models. To assess the broader implications of this model error for the simulated climate change responses, we investigate the impact of Pacific stratocumulus cloud feedback on projected warming patterns, equilibrium climate sensitivity and tropical atmospheric circulation under increased CO2 concentrations. Using the Community Earth System Model, with modifications to enhance low-cloud-cover sensitivity to sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in Pacific stratocumulus regions, we find increased tropical SST variability and persistence, a higher equilibrium climate sensitivity, an enhanced east–west warming contrast across the tropical Pacific, and a stronger slowdown of the Walker circulation under 4×CO2 conditions. Our findings are supported by inter-model relationships across CMIP6 4×CO2 simulations. These results underscore the importance of accurately representing cloud feedback in climate models to predict future climate change impacts not only globally but also on a regional scale, such as warming patterns or circulation change."
10.5194/acp-25-12037-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了上海地区沙尘暴期间水溶性有机物在气相和颗粒相中的分布，以及沙尘对光吸收的影响。虽然论文没有直接涉及遥感技术或卫星观测，但它分析了大气成分（特别是气溶胶和水溶性有机物）的变化，以及这些变化对空气质量和光吸收的影响。这些信息对于验证和补充遥感监测结果，以及理解大气环境过程至关重要。论文揭示了沙尘远距离传输过程中，颗粒物表面吸附和非均相反应导致光吸收增强的现象，这对于改进大气模型和提高遥感反演精度具有重要意义。,"['air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'aerosol', 'gas-to-particle partitioning', 'water-soluble organic compounds', 'Asian dust', 'light absorption', 'brown carbon']",Zheng Li;Gehui Wang;Binyu Xiao;Rongjie Li;Can Wu;Shaojun Lv;Feng Wu;Qingyan Fu;Yusen Duan,Measurement report: simultaneous measurement on gas- and particle-phase water-soluble organics in Shanghai: enhanced light absorption of transported Asian dust,"Gas-to-aerosol partitioning of organics was investigated in Shanghai during the 2023 dust storm period. We found the partitioning coefficients (Fp) of water-soluble organic compounds in the dust storm period (DS) were comparable to those during a haze episode (HE), and aerosol liquid water content primarily drove Fp variation in HE, while pH was the dominant factor in DS. Moreover, an enhanced light absorption of Asian dust by brown carbon, mainly in coarse mode, formation was revealed. 
 To better understand the physicochemical evolution of Asian dust particles during long-range transport, water-soluble organic compounds (WSOCs) in gas- (WSOCg) and particle-phase (WSOCp) in the spring atmosphere of Shanghai during the 2023 dust storm period (DS) and haze events (HE) were simultaneously measured with a 3 h time resolution, and characterized for their optical properties and size distribution. Our results showed that gas-to-particle-phase partitioning coefficients (Fp) of WSOCs in DS (0.30 ± 0.06) was comparable to that in HE (0.32 ± 0.06), although both temperature and relative humidity in DS were not favorable for the partitioning, indicating a promoting role of dust particles in the transformation process of WSOCg from gas to particle phase. Fp variation was largely driven by aerosol liquid water content in HE but by aerosol acidity in DS. WSOCp and its light absorption at λ365 nm dominated at the fine mode (< 2.1 µm) in non-DS period and the coarse mode (> 2.1 µm) in DS, respectively. Mass absorption coefficient (MAC) of the coarse mode of WSOCp at λ365 nm in DS was 0.8 m2 g−1, which is four times that (0.20 ± 0.09 m2 g−1) in the source region of Tengger Desert, suggesting a remarkably increase in light absorbing ability of Asian dust during long-range transport. Sharp co-increases of nitroaromatics, imidazoles, and water-soluble organic nitrogen at the coarse mode in the DS period further revealed that such an increasing MAC is mainly caused by adsorption and heterogeneous formation of light absorbing nitrogen-containing organics on the dust surface during long-range transport."
10.5194/acp-25-11951-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究分析了2010年至2024年间中国地区MODIS气溶胶光学厚度（AOD）的时间序列数据，探讨了气象因素和人为因素对AOD变化的影响。研究表明，减排政策在2018年前有效降低了AOD，但之后由于不利气象条件的影响，减排效果被抵消，导致AOD下降幅度减小甚至出现上升。研究还分析了中国不同地区AOD的变化情况，并强调了气象条件在调节中国AOD方面日益重要的作用。该研究使用了MODIS/MAIAC C6.1 AOD数据，并结合模型模拟数据，对中国五个代表性区域的气象和人为因素对AOD时空变化的影响进行了定量分析。,"['aerosol optical depth', 'AOD', 'MODIS', 'MAIAC', 'air quality monitoring', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'emission reduction policies', 'meteorological effects']",Cheng Fan;Gerrit de Leeuw;Xiaoxi Yan;Jiantao Dong;Hanqing Kang;Chengwei Fang;Zhengqiang Li;Ying Zhang,Evolution of aerosol optical depth over China in 2010–2024: increasing importance of meteorological influences,"This study describes the analysis of time series of the MODIS-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) over China between 2010 and 2024. Emission reduction policies were effective with respect to reducing the AOD until 2018. Thereafter, the overall reduction until the end of the study was very small due to unfavorable meteorological factors cancelling favorable anthropogenic effects and resulting in an AOD increase during extended periods. The variations over different areas in China are discussed. 
 Time series of Collection 6.1 of the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MODIS/MAIAC C6.1) aerosol optical depth (AOD) and model-simulated AOD were used to determine the contributions of meteorological and anthropogenic effects to spatiotemporal AOD variations over five representative areas in China during the period from January 2010 to September 2024. The time series confirm the effective reduction in AOD between 2010 and 2018, with an additional but smaller reduction thereafter. The overall AOD reduction is mainly attributable to emission reduction policies, although with substantial meteorological effects. The respective total reduction and meteorological contributions during the whole study period and the meteorological contributions before and after 2018 over the five regions were as follows (all in %): 68, 12, 16, and 52 for the North China Plain (NCP); 62, 17, 28, and 14 for the Yangtze River Delta (YRD); 70, 33, 31, and 43 for the Pearl River Delta (PRD);  55, 16, 25, and 21 for Hunan and Hubei (HNB);  and 57, 10, 14, and 38 for the Sichuan Basin (SCB). Meteorological effects for each of these periods and each region are discussed in detail. As an example, the above data show that the meteorological effects over the YRD and HNB after 2018 are smaller than before 2018; this can be explained by the occurrence of strong effects in the earlier period and the choice of the period over which effects were calculated. Monthly mean AOD patterns were distinctly different before and after 2016, suggesting that aerosol properties changed in response to the emission reduction policies. In summary, this study highlights the complex interplay between meteorological and anthropogenic factors in shaping AOD variations across China and demonstrates the increasing significance of meteorological conditions in modulating China's AOD."

We found that stratospheric δ13CO2 variations are governed by airborne production of 13C-depleted CO2 by CH4 oxidation, gravitational separation, and propagation of the decreasing tropospheric δ13CO2 trend into the stratosphere. 
 Due to very few reports of δ13CO2 (the stable carbon isotopic ratio of CO2) observations in the stratosphere, its variations are not well understood. In order to elucidate stratospheric δ13CO2 variations and their governing mechanisms, we have collected stratospheric air samples using balloon-borne cryogenic samplers over Japan since 1985 and analyzed them for δ13CO2. To obtain precise δ13CO2 values, we incorporated the mass-independent fractionation of 17O and 18O in the δ13CO2 calculation. δ13CO2 has decreased through time in the mid-stratosphere with an average rate of change of −0.026 ± 0.001 ‰ yr−1 for the period 1985–2020, consistent with that in the troposphere. However, mid-stratospheric δ13CO2 values did not show a time delay compared to the tropical tropospheric values. This could be explained by the production of CO2 by CH4 oxidation and the gravitational separation of 13CO2 and 12CO2. To confirm this hypothesis, we used a two-dimensional model to simulate the stratospheric δ13CO2 values while accounting for these processes. The results indicate that these two effects strongly impact the vertical distribution of δ13CO2. We newly defined “stratospheric potential δ13C” (δ13CP) as a quasi-conservative parameter incorporating the kinetic isotope effect of CH4 oxidation and gravitational separation, and we found that δ13CP in the mid-latitude mid-stratosphere decreases over time with about a 5 yr lag relative to the tropical upper troposphere. This fact strongly supports that stratospheric δ13CO2 variations are governed by the airborne production of 13C-depleted CO2 by CH4 oxidation, the gravitational separation, and the propagation of the decreasing tropospheric δ13CO2 trend into the stratosphere."

Sowlat,Tracing ammonia emission sources in California's Salton Sea region: insights from airborne longwave-infrared hyperspectral imaging and ground monitoring,"Ammonia (NH3) is a key air pollutant linked to fine particle pollution, yet its sources remain poorly understood. Using airborne infrared imaging and ground sensors, we mapped NH3 emissions in California’s Salton Sea region with unprecedented detail. We found high emissions from farms, geothermal plants, and waste sites, including sources missing from inventories. These findings highlight the need for better NH3 monitoring to improve air quality models and guide pollution reduction strategies. 
 Ammonia (NH3) plays an important role in atmospheric chemistry and air quality, but its emissions remain poorly constrained due to its short atmospheric lifetime, high spatial heterogeneity, and limited coverage of existing monitoring resources. This study integrates airborne longwave-infrared (LWIR) hyperspectral imaging at ∼2 m spatial resolution with ground-based stationary and mobile in situ measurements to map and characterize NH3 emissions in two regions near the Salton Sea in southern California: Mecca in the northwest and Imperial in the southeast. Airborne surveys conducted in March and September 2023 with a wide-swath LWIR spectral imager revealed pronounced spatial and seasonal variability. Average NH3 levels in Imperial were 2.5–8 times higher than those in Mecca, linked primarily to large, concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), geothermal power plants, fumaroles, and intensive agricultural activities. Ground-based mobile monitoring corroborated these findings, showing elevated NH3 levels near these sources and especially high NH3 concentrations downwind of CAFOs with large cattle populations. The results underscore the utility of airborne LWIR hyperspectral imaging in detecting and mapping NH3 at hyperlocal scales, including sources absent from existing inventories. They further highlight the need for routine airborne campaigns and the development of next-generation satellite missions with higher spatial resolution to achieve comprehensive, large-area monitoring. These findings inform air quality management strategies and emphasize the importance of improving emission inventories for effective mitigation of NH3-driven air pollution."

We found that fungal spores are the main contributors to ice formation at warmer temperatures. These particles are released locally and vary with the weather. Our results also show that we know very little about which fungi can form ice in the atmosphere, highlighting a major gap in our understanding of how nature influences weather and climate. 
 Primary biological aerosol particles (PBAPs) can influence weather and climate by acting as high-temperature ice nucleating particles (INPs), especially in clean, rural regions like the European sub-Arctic. However, the actual contribution to atmospheric ice nucleation and the exact identity of PBAPs serving as INPs remain poorly understood.Here, we present measurements of INPs and highly fluorescent aerosol particles (HFAPs) over the course of 1 year at the Pallas Atmosphere-Ecosystem Supersite in the Finnish sub-Arctic, aiming to determine whether PBAPs significantly contribute to atmospheric INPs and to identify which types do so. Our findings indicate that certain HFAPs are strongly influenced by meteorological variables, with high concentrations occurring when the station is within the atmospheric mixing layer, suggesting local biological sources. These HFAPs are the main contributors to high-temperature INPs, with an exceptionally strong correlation (r=0.94, p<0.0001) between HFAP concentrations and INPs active at −13.5 °C. For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we combine INP and HFAP data with direct fungal spore counts and environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis to determine the biological origins of HFAPs and INPs. The results suggest that most high-temperature INPs are likely fungal spores. eDNA analysis further reveals that airborne fungi are dominated by Basidiomycota and that only a small fraction of the detected fungal genera have, to date, been tested for ice nucleation activity (INA) according to the literature. Among those reported in the literature, most exhibit very low or no INA. This underscores the significant knowledge gap in our understanding of biological ice nucleation in the atmosphere."

Hua, China","Biogenic secondary organic aerosol (BSOA), as an important atmospheric component, is prevalent within the boundary layer and can influence air quality and human health. Our observations demonstrate that anthropogenic NOx and the enhanced aerosol water driven by sulfate inhibit BSOA formation in lifting air masses, leading to a moderate reduction in the SOA burden in the upper boundary layer. 
 Anthropogenic effects on biogenic secondary organic aerosol (BSOA) formation in the upper boundary layer are still not fully understood. Here, a synchronized 4-hourly monitoring of three typical BSOA tracers from isoprene, monoterpenes, β-caryophyllene, and other particulate pollutants was conducted at the mountain foot (MF, 400 m above sea level (m a.s.l.)) and mountainside (MS, 1120 m a.s.l.) of Mt. Hua, China, to investigate the chemical evolution of BSOA in air mass lifting. Our findings revealed that BSOA was the predominant source of organic matter (OM) at the MS site, with an average fraction of ∼43 % being ∼7-fold  that at the MF site. As the prevalent BSOA tracer, the isoprene-derived SOA tracers (BSOAI) stayed at a comparable level at the MF site (183±81ngm-3) and MS site (197±127ngm-3) yet exhibited an inverse diurnal pattern between the two sites. And the BSOAI fraction in OM aloft moderately decreased during the daytime and correlated positively with the 2-methyltetrol/2-methylglyceric acid ratio but negatively with NOx transported from ground level, indicating that anthropogenic NOx significantly affected the daytime BSOA formation aloft by inhibiting the HO2•-pathway products. Additionally, the further formation of sulfate in a lifting air mass significantly enhanced aerosol water content aloft, which suppressed the reactive uptake of isoprene epoxydiol and ultimately diminished the BSOAI yields during the daytime. These findings provide more insight into the intricate anthropogenic–biogenic interactions affecting BSOA formation in the upper boundary layer."

The validation against homogenized ozone sondes reveals an overall good agreement with slight biases (3 %–6 %) in tropospheric ozone and a possible temporal drift, but this is difficult to assess due to the limited number of sites. No specific trends are estimated for the tropospheric ozone column for the period 2008–2022, but persistent negative trends are observed in the lower troposphere. 
 The Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) has been monitoring the atmosphere for operational meteorology and atmospheric composition studies since 2007 with a succession of three instruments aboard the Metop-A (2006–2021), Metop-B (2012–Present), and Metop-C (2018–Present) missions. One of the key species monitored is ozone (O3). This study assesses the quality of the regional IASI-O3 KOPRA (Karlsruhe Optimized and Precise Radiative transfer Algorithm) product, version 3.0, and the consistency of the three IASI instruments, IASI-A, IASI-B, and IASI-C, for time series and trend analyses. The IASI-O3 KOPRA products of the three instruments show a very good agreement and consistency, better than 1 %, for the tropospheric ozone column (TrOC) and several partial columns (surface–450 hPa, surface–300 hPa) across the three study domains: Europe, North America, and East Asia. For the quality assessment and trend analyses, we combine the ozone products derived from IASI-A (2008–2018) and IASI-B (2019–2022). The comparison with homogenized ozone sondes for six northern midlatitude stations reveals a small negative bias of about 3 %–6 % in the IASI-O3 KOPRA products in the troposphere for both profiles and columns. A rather good correlation between 0.7 and 0.9 is observed, and an error of about 15 %–17 % (compared to sondes smoothed with averaging kernels, AKs) is estimated. The ozone variability is also well reproduced for all the partial columns with a slight underestimation of about 10 % for the TrOC. Based on the comparison with the ozone sondes, we identified a temporal drift (of about −0.06 ± 0.02 DU yr−1 on average) for three different ozone columns (TrOC, surface–450 hPa, surface–300 hPa). This drift can be more pronounced in summer. However, a significant variability of the estimated drifts depending on the sample of ozone sonde sites is remarked, that does not allow its use for correcting the IASI ozone product time series data over broad domains. While the upper tropospheric ozone trends are mainly positive or undefined, the lower tropospheric ozone trends are mainly systematically negative. The regions most affected by negative trends are the Mediterranean, Western North America, Eastern North America, and East Asia. Compensations between lower and upper tropospheric trends prevent the identification of any specific long-term behavior for TrOCs over the three domains. The negative tropospheric ozone column anomalies observed during the period 2020–2022 (the post-COVID-19 period) only slightly impact the trends already ongoing for the period 2008–2019."

Using the ""Global Irradiance"" method from the Norwegian GUV network, it showed ozone values matching Direct Sun Brewer measurements with a 1.8 % standard deviation. Despite temperature and cloud dependencies, the instrument is robust and easy to use. Fully coverage of the UV-A/B spectrum allows for further UV-radiation analysis. Total cost is less than EUR 3000. 
 A new design for a simple and very low-cost instrument for measuring total column ozone is described and its performance evaluated by comparison to a co-located MK III Brewer spectrophotometer for approximately 6 months. The ozone retrieval is based on the “Global Irradiance” method used to derive total column ozone from the Norwegian GUV radiometer network. While the total cost of components of the instrument was less than EUR 3000, total ozone values were found to agree with Direct Sun Brewer values with a standard deviation of 1.8 %, comparable to the agreement between DS and ZS Brewer data. The most significant limitations of the retrieval method were found to be the dependence on temperature and cloud-amount. As well as being low-cost, the instrument appears robust and easy to operate. As the instrument covers fully the UV-A/B spectrum it is fully possible to further develop the analyses software to include other data products related to UV-radiation."

This study shows that the oblique angle of incidence will be advantageous compared to standard nadir-looking radars due to substantial clutter suppression over the ocean surface. This feature will enable the detection and quantification of light and moderate precipitation, with improved proximity to the surface. 
 The Earth's strong radar surface return limits the detection of clouds and precipitation in the lowest part of the atmosphere by nadir-pointing spaceborne radars such as CloudSat and EarthCARE. The strength of the Earth's surface radar return is significantly reduced at non-zero incidence angles. The WIVERN (WInd Velocity Radar Nephoscope) 94 GHz radar, currently undergoing Phase-A studies by ESA, employs a 3 m antenna and conical radar sampling at high incidence angles. Here, the benefits of the narrow field of view and the reduction in the Earth's surface return for studying clouds and precipitation in the lowest kilometres of the atmosphere are quantified. The WIVERN radar is expected to improve the ratio of signal (hydrometeors) to clutter (surface return) over ice-free ocean surfaces and marginally worsen it over land and sea ice. The impact of these findings on the detection of light rainfall and snowfall near the Earth's surface is discussed."

The purpose of this dataset is to promote the three-dimensional studies of rain cell precipitation systems and to reveal the spatial and temporal variations in their scale, morphology, and intensity. 
 Understanding the characteristics of the rain cell, the most basic unit in the natural precipitation system, is helpful in improving the cognition of the precipitation system. In this study, based on the merged precipitation profile data, reflectance and infrared data, and microwave brightness temperature data observed by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation radar (PR), visible and infrared scanner (VIRS) and TRMM microwave imager (TMI), rain cells were identified in the PR swath. For the identified valid rain cells, two fitting methods (the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) and the best fit ellipse (BFE)) were applied to fit the external frame. Then, the geometric and physical parameters of rain cells were also calculated. By analyzing the geometric parameters (length, width, height, and so on) and physical parameters (rain rate, visible reflectance and thermal infrared brightness temperature from cloud top, and microwave brightness temperature from cloud column) of two rain cells (weak rain cell and strong rain cell), the results indicate that the strong rain cell is filled with deep convective precipitation and has low thermal infrared brightness temperature at the cloud top, while the weak rain cell is mainly characterized by stratiform precipitation with low rain rate. Compared to the BFE method, the area of the external frame calculated by the MBR method is generally larger. The filling ratio of the BFE method is slightly higher than that of the MBR method. In general, the results indicate that the rain cell definition parameters using the two fitting methods are reasonable and intuitive.

Using models and satellite data, we mapped the emissions of isoprene from plants across Europe and found that droughts can reduce leaf growth, leading to lower emissions. This shows that to understand and predict air quality, we must also understand how drought impacts vegetation. Our findings highlight the value of linking extreme weather, plant health, and pollution in models of the Earth system as a whole. 
 Biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions from vegetation represent a major source of volatile compounds globally and play an important role as precursors for tropospheric ozone. Understanding their emissions is therefore crucial for quantifying the impact of ozone on air quality. We present two datasets of biogenic volatile organic compound emissions that cover the European modelling domain of the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service at a resolution of 0.1° × 0.1° to support the study of European scale air quality. The compounds included in the dataset follow the VOCs included in the regional atmospheric chemistry model mechanism (RACM). The datasets were produced within the framework of the EU's SEEDS project. We produced each dataset by coupling modelling output variables from the SURFEX land surface model with the MEGAN3.0 BVOC emission model. In one instance, the SURFEX model was run in free-running mode, which we term the open-loop (OL) and in the other case we assimilated satellite observations of leaf area index (LAI), which we term the analysis. The OL and analysis land surface model outputs form the basis for each emission dataset that are called SURFEX-MEGAN3.0 OL and SURFEX-MEGAN3.0 analysis, respectively. The OL dataset is available over a five-year period from 2018–2022 and the analysis dataset is available over the three-year period 2018–2020. SURFEX was run for both the OL and analysis simulations in a configuration that allowed simulated vegetation to respond to variations in meteorology over time to more realistically track vegetation phenology. Evaluation of the land surface model output LAI and root-zone soil moisture (RZSM) showed that the OL and analysis simulations had good skill at tracking temporal changes in both variables, with the analysis performing better in each instance. We perform a variety of evaluations on the isoprene emissions specifically given the importance of this compound for atmospheric chemistry. We evaluated the temporal variability of isoprene emissions in both datasets and found that the majority of the interannual and monthly variability was linked to variability in LAI that in specific cases, like the summer of 2019, could be linked to drought impacts on vegetation growth simulated by SURFEX. We evaluated the daily temporal variability of the OL and analysis isoprene emission datasets against in-situ online observations of isoprene concentrations at 8 sites in western Europe and found moderate to strong correlation between the emissions and observations in almost all location-year pairings. We also evaluated the OL and analysis emission datasets against other published bottom-up isoprene emission datasets over the same European domain used in this study. We found that the SURFEX-MEGAN3.0 OL and analysis isoprene emission datasets lie between the minimum (CAMS-GLOB-BIOv3.1) and maximum (MEGAN-MACC) published emission datasets based on bottom-up approaches. Furthermore, we were able to attribute differences in seasonality between SURFEX-MEGAN3.0 and other emission inventories to differences in the temporal variability of the underlying LAI dataset used to compile them. Overall, our findings show the importance of variability in LAI in controlling isoprene emissions on monthly to annual timescales. Combining this with the demonstrated skill of the emissions in evaluation with independent data, this points towards the value of an Earth-system approach to BVOC emission modelling."

It offers 9 d maps on a 25 km EASE-SL grid, from 2011 to 2023, covering areas south of 30° S. The product is accurate beyond 150 km from sea ice, with nearly zero bias and a ~0.22 STD. It tracks well seasonal and interannual changes and will contribute to the understanding of processes influenced by upper-ocean salinity, including ice formation/melt. 
 This paper presents a newly developed Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) product for the Southern Ocean (SO), derived from SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) measurements by the Barcelona Expert Center (BEC). The primary challenges in retrieving SSS from L-band brightness temperature (TB) measurements in the Southern Ocean include degraded sensitivity in cold waters, radiometric signal contamination near sea ice edges and low variability in SSS across the region. To address these challenges, significant improvements were made to the retrieval algorithms. The BEC SO SSS product v1.0 delivers 9 d SSS maps on a 25 km EASE-SL grid, generated daily. The time series spans from 1 February 2011, to 31 March 2023, with spatial coverage below 30° S (https://doi.org/10.20350/digitalCSIC/15493, González-Gambau et al., 2023).The product shows high accuracy farther than 150 km from sea ice edges, with nearly zero bias and a standard deviation of 0.22 (compared to marine mammal data) and 0.25 (compared to TSG data from research vessels). Larger errors are observed within 150 km from the ice edges, due to residual sea-ice contamination and sampling-related errors in these dynamic areas. The product effectively captures seasonal and interannual variability, in line with the SOSE regional model. Although differences between satellite-derived and in situ salinity are more pronounced in these regions, the satellite product successfully reproduces the dynamics near ice edges.This product will significantly contribute to the understanding of processes influenced by upper-ocean salinity, including sea ice dynamics, particularly, the reduction of Antarctic sea ice extent and the opening of offshore polynyas."

Understanding and predicting it is crucial. Various models have been developed to model air pollution. However, the consistency exhibited by a model in different areas is commonly neglected. Our study accounts for this and shows lower accuracy near busy roads but higher accuracy in less populated areas. Considering location characteristics in air pollution predictions is important in comparing statistical models and understanding the health–society–space relationship. 
 Air pollution leads to various health and societal issues. Modeling and predicting air pollution over space have important implications in health studies, urban planning, and policy-making. Many statistical models have been developed to understand the relationships between geospatial data and air pollution sources. An important aspect often neglected is spatial heterogeneity; however, the relationships between geographically distributed variables and air pollutants commonly vary over space. This study aims to evaluate and compare various spatial and non-spatial statistical modeling (including machine learning) methods within different spatial groups. The spatial groups are defined by traffic- and population-related variables. Models are classified into local and global models. Local models use air pollution measurements from the Amsterdam area. Global models use ground station observations in Germany and in the Netherlands. We found that prediction accuracy differs substantially in different spatial groups. Predictions for places near roads with high populations show poor prediction accuracy, while prediction accuracy increases in low-population-density areas for both local and global models. The prediction accuracy is further increased in places far from roads for global models. Modeling of air pollution in different spatial groups shows that nonlinear methods can have higher prediction accuracy than linear methods. The spatial prediction patterns of global models show that nonlinear methods generally are less sensitive to extreme values compared to linear methods. Additionally, clusters of predicted air pollution differ between models within cities despite similar prediction accuracy. Also, the influence of predictors on NO2 concentrations varies across different cities. Using the local dataset of our study and explicitly accounting for spatial autocorrelation in the universal and ordinary kriging models does not improve accuracy; however, analyzing prediction performance across spatial groups provides valuable insights. Comparing local and global prediction patterns reveals that local models capture regional clusters of high air pollution, which are not detected by global models. These findings highlight the fact that solely relying on overall prediction accuracy can be insufficient and potentially misleading, underscoring the importance of considering spatial variability and model performance within different spatial groups."

A custom grid of ~7 km was created over Michigan. A sector-based diurnal cycle for anthropogenic nitric oxide was included in the model. This work shows that grid resolution plays a more important role in relation to O3 precursors and that the diurnal cycle significantly impacts nighttime O3 formation. 
 Surface ozone (O3) in Southeast Michigan (SEMI) often exceeds US National Ambient Air Quality Standards, posing risks to human health and agroecosystems. SEMI, a relatively small region in the state of Michigan, contains most of the state's anthropogenic emission sources and more than half of the state's population and is also prone to long-range and transboundary pollutant transport. Here, we explore the distribution of O3 and its precursors, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds, over SEMI during the summer of 2021 using the chemistry–climate model MUSICAv0 (Multi-Scale Infrastructure for Chemistry and Aerosols Version 0). Using the regional refinement capabilities of MUSICAv0, we create a custom grid over the state of Michigan of 1/16° (∼ 7 km) to better understand the local-scale impacts of chemical and dynamic complexity in SEMI and compare it with a grid with 1/8° (∼ 14 km) resolution over the contiguous United States. Model simulations are evaluated using a comprehensive suite of observations from Phase I of the Michigan–Ontario Ozone Source Experiment (MOOSE) field campaign. MUSICAv0, with its higher horizontal grid resolution, showed excellent skill in capturing peak O3 concentrations but showed larger variation in the simulation of O3 precursors (e.g., NOx, HCHO, isoprene). In addition, we implement a diurnal cycle for anthropogenic nitric oxide (NO) emissions, which is generally not included in global models. As a result, modeled nighttime O3 is improved because of lower NOx concentrations during the night. This work shows that when conceptualizing models in urban regions, it is important to consider a combination of high horizontal resolution and the diurnal cycle of emissions, as they can have important implications for the simulation of secondary air pollutants."

Stappard;Jamie D. Wilson;Andrew Yool;Toby Tyrrell,NutGEnIE 1.0: nutrient cycle extensions to the cGEnIE  Earth system model to examine the long-term influence  of nutrients on oceanic primary production,"This research explores nutrient limitations in oceanic primary production. While traditional experiments identify the immediate limiting nutrient at specific locations, this study aims to identify the ultimate limiting nutrient (ULN), which governs long-term productivity. A mathematical model incorporating nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron nutrient cycles is used. The model's results are compared with ocean observational data to assess its effectiveness in investigating the ULN. 
 Understanding the nuances of the effects of nutrient limitation on oceanic primary production has been the focus of many bioassay experiments by oceanographers. A theme of these investigations is that they identify the currently limiting nutrient at a given location, or in other words they identify the proximate limiting nutrient (PLN). However, the ultimate limiting nutrient (ULN; the nutrient whose supply controls system productivity over extensive timescales) can be different from the PLN. Our motivation is to investigate the identity of the ULN. The ULN constrains oceanic primary production over extensive timescales and consequently overall ocean fertility. The rate of oceanic photosynthesis affects planetary oxygen and carbon dioxide, impacting climate. Understanding past ocean fertility is fundamental to understanding Earth system history and biological evolution.Investigations that have considered the ULN have often utilised box models for example the work of, Tyrrell (1999) and Lenton and Watson (2000). To facilitate investigation of the ULN the carbon-centric Grid Enabled Integrated Earth system model (cGEnIE) nutrient cycles have been extended to create NutGEnIE. NutGEnIE incorporates three open nutrients cycles nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron. The impacts of diazotrophs, capable of fixing nitrogen, are represented alongside those of other phytoplankton. NutGEnIE is capable of extended duration model simulations necessary to investigate the ULN while, at the same time, including iron as a potentially limiting nutrient. NutGEnIE is described here, with particular focus on the biogeochemical cycles of iron, nitrogen and phosphorus. Model results are compared to ocean observational data to assess the degree of realism. Model-data comparisons include physical properties, nutrient concentrations, and process rates (e.g., export and nitrogen fixation). The comparisons of NutGEnIE to ocean observational data are largely positive, suggesting that the dynamics of NutGEnIE are valid. The validations, allied to the ability to run an Earth System model with open nutrients cycles of nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron over extensive time periods supports the proposed use of NutGEnIE to revisit the question of the ULN for oceanic primary production."

All revisions significantly reduce the overestimation of surface fine dust from 94 % to 35 % while retaining comparable skill in representing columnar abundance. 
 Accurate representation of mineral dust remains a challenge for global air quality or climate models due to inadequate parametrization of the emission scheme, removal mechanisms, and size distribution. While various studies have constrained aspects of dust emission fluxes and/or dust optical depth, annual mean surface dust concentrations still vary by factors of 5–10 among models. In this study, we focus on improving the annual simulation of fine dust in the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model, leveraging recent mechanistic understanding of dust source and removal, and reconciling the size differences between models and ground-based measurements. Specifically, we conduct sensitivity simulations using GEOS-Chem in its high performance configuration (GCHP) version 14.4.1 to investigate the effects of mechanism or parameter updates on annual mean concentrations. The results are evaluated by comparisons versus Deep Blue satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) and AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) ground-based AOD for total column abundance, and versus the Surface Particulate Matter Network (SPARTAN) for novel measurements of surface PM2.5 dust concentrations. Reconciling modelled geometric diameter versus measured aerodynamic diameter is important for consistent comparison. The two-fold overestimation of surface fine dust in the standard model is alleviated by 39 % without degradation of total column abundance by implementing a new physics-based dust emission scheme with better spatial distribution. Further reduction by 20 % of the overestimation of surface PM2.5 dust is achieved through reducing the mass fraction of emitted fine dust based on the brittle fragmentation theory, and explicit tracking of three additional fine mineral dust size bins with updated parametrization for below-cloud scavenging. Overall, these developments reduce the normalized mean difference against surface fine dust measurements from SPARTAN from 94 % to 35 %, while retaining comparable skill of total column abundance against satellite and ground-based AOD."

 Chronic infections and cancer cause T cell dysfunction known as exhaustion. This cell state is caused by persistent antigen exposure, suboptimal co-stimulation and a plethora of hostile factors that dampen protective immunity and limit the efficacy of immunotherapies1–4. The mechanisms that underlie T cell exhaustion remain poorly understood. Here we analyse the proteome of CD8+ exhausted T (Tex) cells across multiple states of exhaustion in the context of both chronic viral infections and cancer. We show that there is a non-stochastic pathway-specific discordance between mRNA and protein dynamics between T effector (Teff) and Tex cells. We identify a distinct proteotoxic stress response (PSR) in Tex cells, which we term Tex-PSR. Contrary to canonical stress responses that induce a reduction in protein synthesis5,6, Tex-PSR involves an increase in global translation activity and an upregulation of specialized chaperone proteins. Tex-PSR is further characterized by the accumulation of protein aggregates and stress granules and an increase in autophagy-dominant protein catabolism. We establish that disruption of proteostasis alone can convert Teff cells to Tex cells, and we link Tex-PSR mechanistically to persistent AKT signalling. Finally, disruption of Tex-PSR-associated chaperones in CD8+ T cells improves cancer immunotherapy in preclinical models. Moreover, a high Tex-PSR in T cells from patients with cancer confers poor responses to clinical immunotherapy. Collectively, our findings indicate that Tex-PSR is a hallmark and a mechanistic driver of T cell exhaustion, which raises the possibility of targeting proteostasis pathways as an approach for cancer immunotherapy. A proteotoxic stress response specific to exhausted T cells, governed by AKT signaling and accompanied by increased protein translation, represents a mechanistic vulnerability and a new therapeutic target to improve cancer immunotherapies."

 During the Last Glacial Maximum (23,000 to 19,000 years ago), the Patagonian Ice Sheet covered the central chain of the Andes between 38 °S and 55 °S. The paleoclimatic evidence from Patagonia and New Zealand suggests that the maximum glacier expansion of the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes was desynchronized with the Northern Hemisphere glacial history. Here we present numerical simulations of the Patagonian ice sheet throughout the Last Glacial Cycle. Our analysis suggests that the Patagonian ice sheet had two main periods of advance, during the Marine Isotope Stage 4 and late Marine Isotope Stage 3, experiencing inter-millennial scale variability. We show that the Patagonian Ice Sheet long-term evolution can be attributed to changes in the integrated summer insolation, which combines the summer duration and insolation intensity and has an obliquity-like periodicity. We further suggest that this metric also modulated the behaviour of glaciers over the entire Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes.

 Copy number variations (CNVs), the gain or loss of genomic regions, are associated with disease, especially cancer. Single cell technologies offer new possibilities to capture within-sample heterogeneity of CNVs and identify subclones relevant for tumor progression and treatment outcome. Several computational tools have been developed to identify CNVs from scRNA-seq data. However, an independent benchmarking of them is lacking. Here, we evaluate six popular methods in their ability to correctly identify ground truth CNVs, euploid cells and subclonal structures in 21 scRNA-seq datasets. We discover dataset-specific factors influencing the performance, including dataset size, the number and type of CNVs in the sample and the choice of the reference dataset. Methods which include allelic information perform more robustly for large droplet-based datasets, but require higher runtime. Furthermore, the methods differ in their additional functionalities. We offer a benchmarking pipeline to identify the optimal method for new datasets, and improve methods’ performance.

 Conjointly activating metal and oxygen sites to trigger the adsorbate evolution and lattice oxygen mechanisms coupled path holds promise for balancing activity and stability in oxygen evolution reaction catalysts, yet confronting great challenges. Herein, we develop Fe species and oxygen vacancies co-regulated Ni-(oxy)hydroxide from the deep reconstruction of Fe-Ni2P/NiMoO4 pre-catalyst achieving the adsorbate evolution and lattice oxygen dual-path mechanism. Experimental details and theoretical calculation analysis reveal the enhanced adsorbate evolution mechanism kinetics at the Ni sites via the co-regulation of Fe species and oxygen vacancies, while the Fe incorporation activates the O sites with preferable adsorption free energy for lattice oxygen mechanism intermediates. Benefiting from the dual-path mechanism, the activated catalyst affords an ampere-scale current density of 1.0 A cm-2 at low overpotentials of 274.5 ± 4.2 and 299.1 ± 2.8 mV in alkaline freshwater and seawater, respectively, and maintains seawater electrocatalysis for 500 h in the anion exchange membrane water electrolysis.

 Tectonic processes and astronomical cycles are key drivers of Earth’s climate and carbon systems. However, their interplay in shaping late Paleozoic climate variability remains poorly constrained. Here, we divide the late Paleozoic (~360–250 Ma) into three distinct tectonic phases based on full-plate tectonic reconstructions, geochemical datasets, and carbon cycle modeling, thereby elucidating how global sea levels and organic carbon burial responded to astronomically forced climate fluctuations under different tectonic phases. Our results show that intervals spanning ~360–330 Ma and ~280–250 Ma were characterized by elevated atmospheric CO2 levels and intensified tectonic activity, which coincided with heightened climate variability and reduced regularity in orbitally paced sea-level changes. In contrast, during ~330–280 Ma, multiple proxies indicate reduced tectonic forcing and lower CO2 concentrations, which were accompanied by more stable climate conditions and clearer expression of astronomical cycles. These conditions facilitated rhythmic deposition and widespread organic carbon burial.

 Although genome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights into the genetic basis of complex traits and diseases, translating these findings to causal genes and their downstream mechanisms remains challenging. We performed trans expression quantitative trait locus (trans-eQTL) meta-analysis in 3734 lymphoblastoid cell line samples, identifying four robust loci that replicated in an independent multi-ethnic dataset of 682 individuals. The trans-eQTL signal at the ubiquitin specific peptidase 18 (USP18) locus colocalised with a GWAS signal for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). USP18 is a known negative regulator of interferon signalling and the SLE risk allele increased the expression of 50 interferon-inducible genes, suggesting that the risk allele impairs USP18’s ability to effectively limit the interferon response. Intriguingly, the USP18 trans-eQTL signal would not have been discovered in a meta-analysis of up to 43,301 whole blood samples, reaffirming the importance of capturing context-specific genetic effects for GWAS interpretation.

We herein disclose a practical cobalt-catalyzed divergent radical alkene carbonylative functionalization under 1 atm of CO at 23 °C. The leverage of the tridentate NNN-type pincer ligand is the key to avoid the formation of catalytically inert Co0(CO)n species and overcome the occurrence of oxidative carbonylation of organozincs, selectively tuning the catalytic reactivity of cobalt center for dictating a full cobalt-catalyzed four-component carbonylation. Moreover, direct use CO2 as the C1 source in the multicomponent alkene carbonylative couplings can be achieved under a tandem electro-thermo-catalysis, thus allowing us to rapidly and reliably construct unsymmetric ketones with ample scope and excellent functional group compatibility. Remarkably, our protocol encompasses a broader of polyhaloalkanes as the electrophiles, which underwent radical-relay couplings in a completely regio- and chemoselective fashion.

 Low-cost air quality sensors (LCS) are increasingly used to complement traditional air quality monitoring yet concerns about their accuracy and fitness-for-purpose persist. This scoping review investigates topics, methods, and technologies in the application of LCS networks in recent years that are gaining momentum, focusing on LCS networks (LCSN) operation, drone-based and mobile monitoring, data fusion/assimilation, and community engagement. We identify several key challenges remaining. A major limitation is the absence of unified performance metrics and cross-validation methods to compare different LCSN calibration and imputation techniques and meta-analyses. LCSN still face challenges in effectively sharing and interpreting data due to a lack of common protocols and standardized definitions, which can hinder collaboration and data integration across different systems. In mobile monitoring, LCS siting, orientation, and platform speed are challenges to data consistency of different LCS types and limit the transferability of static calibration models to mobile settings. For drone-based monitoring, rotor downwash, LCS placement, flight pattern, and environmental variability complicate accurate measurements. In integrating LCS data with air quality models or data assimilation, realistic uncertainty quantification, ideally at the individual measurement level, remains a major obstacle. Finally, citizen science initiatives often encounter motivational, technological, economic, societal, and regulatory barriers that hinder their scalability and long-term impact."

 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment reports treat politicians as recipients of information, but not as foci of research efforts. Moreover, academic research on politicians’ knowledge concentrates on belief in climate change’s anthropogenic cause. Little is known of how aware national parliamentarians are of key findings and policy recommendations from assessment reports. Here, we address this through a survey of 100 Members of Parliament in the United Kingdom on their knowledge of the well-publicised statement from the 6th assessment report of when global greenhouse emissions need to peak for a global temperature increase limit of 1.5 °C to be possible. Parliamentarians overwhelmingly overestimate the time period humanity has left to bend the temperature curve although partisan differences apply. Public surveys in Britain as well as Canada, Chile and Germany show similarly low knowledge, yet being younger, worried about climate change, and having lower levels of conspiracy belief mentality increase accuracy significantly.

 We present the first systematic study on Arctic iceberg area retrieval from Sentinel-1 Extra Wide Swath SAR data. Our dataset contains 4014 Arctic icebergs in open water. To detect icebergs in Sentinel-1 images, we applied a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) algorithm. Icebergs were matched in co-located Sentinel-1 and optical Sentinel-2 acquisitions for a period from May to September in the years 2016 to 2023. The Sentinel-1 iceberg areas are moderately correlated with the Sentinel-2 reference areas, with Pearson’s r-values of 0.65 at HH- and 0.69 at HV-polarization. The CFAR algorithm mostly overestimates iceberg areas in both channels, but in some cases underestimates iceberg areas in the HV channel when the iceberg backscatter is low. The 10th and 90th percentiles of the relative error are -36% and +569% at HH-, and -37% and +349% at HV-polarization. In addition to a resolution-imposed size-dependency of the error, we find that the HH ocean clutter is moderately negatively correlated with the relative error (Pearson’s r-value: -0.64). Additionally, we observe weak correlations between the HH (HV) iceberg backscatter and the Sentinel-2 iceberg area, with a Pearson’s r-value of 0.34 (0.26). We utilize the analyzed relationships to predict iceberg areas from Sentinel-1 data, using a gradient boosting regression. Backscatter-sensitive retrieval models yield more accurate iceberg areas than backscatter-insensitive models. In the HH (HV) channel, the former models reduce the mean absolute error by 58% (49%). Backscatter-sensitive retrieval of iceberg areas will foster consistent SAR-based observations of Arctic iceberg areas during summer months. Future studies need to quantify the combined impact of iceberg area retrieval and iceberg detection performance on area distributions and total iceberg areas."

 Forests are the key component of terrestrial ecosystems, playing a vital role in the global carbon and water cycles as well as in climate change. Satellite remote sensing imagery has the advantage of quantitatively monitoring and assessing the health status of forest canopies at large scales. With the improvement in spatial resolution of satellite sensors, it has become feasible to conduct quantitative research at high spatial resolutions (< 10 m). However, classic physical models that are based on simplified assumptions and only account for the radiative transfer process within the target pixel face challenges in supporting quantitative analysis at high-resolution scales, as high-resolution pixels are subject to significant radiative influences from adjacent pixels. In this study, we propose a high-spatial resolution forest canopy reflectance model, APPLE-GO, which comprehensively considers the shading effect and cross-radiation caused by adjacent pixels. The two-dimensional path length distribution (2-PLD) method is used to calculate the area fractions of each component, while shading factors are introduced to quantitatively calculate the reductions in the area fractions of sunlit components due to adjacent pixels. Multiple scattering energy is calculated based on the spectral invariant theory and the eight-neighborhood convolution algorithm. The bi-directional reflectance factor (BRF) calculated by the APPLE-GO model was evaluated against the three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer model LESS, yielding RMSEs/RRMSEs of 0.008/10.2 % and 0.054/15.9 % in the red and near-infrared (NIR) bands, respectively. The model was also validated with satellite observations, showing RMSEs below 0.01 (RRMSE <27 %) for larch forests and under 0.017 (RRMSE <35 %) for mixed forests in the visible bands. These results demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately calculate the BRF in the nadir viewing direction, highlighting its potential for extracting vegetation parameters from high-resolution remotely sensed imagery."

 Large-drop heavy rainfall, defined as heavy rainfall (>10 mm h−1) with relatively large raindrop diameters and low number concentrations, has been known to occur mainly in continental deep convection based on previous ground-based studies. With spaceborne radar, global analysis of raindrop size has become possible, providing a unique opportunity to revisit this understanding. Using 10 years (2014–2023) of GPM Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) observations, large-drop heavy rainfall events are classified into two types with a Gaussian Mixture Model based on storm height. The two resulting types—high storm height (HSH) and low storm height (LSH)—exhibit similar DSD characteristics but distinct structural and environmental properties in observations and reanalysis data. The HSH type is associated with continental deep convection under warm conditions favorable for collision–coalescence processes. In contrast, the LSH type features shallower storm structures in cold environments, with large drops likely formed by melting snow. Seasonal analyses show that HSH events occur mainly over continental regions in summer, whereas LSH events are mostly observed over midlatitude oceans in winter. For diurnal variation, HSH events exhibit a daytime peak, while LSH events show no diurnal cycle. Notably, more than half of the LSH events at midlatitudes are linked to extratropical cyclones. These findings demonstrate that large-drop heavy rainfall occurs not only over continental regions in summer, but also over midlatitude oceans in winter. These findings provide useful information for improving satellite precipitation retrieval algorithms and microphysical parameterizations in weather prediction models, particularly for better performance over midlatitude oceans."

 A rare event of sand/dust weather in Hong Kong occurred in the evening of April 12, 2025 and lasted till April 17, 2025. It is very uncommon because the sand/dust, originating from Mongolia, managed to climb over the mountains at Nanling in central-southern China with heights reaching about 2000 m above sea level, and reached the coast of southern China. Analysis of local observations confirming the occurrence sand/dust weather, namely, PM10, PM2.5/PM10 ratio, AERONET observations and chemical speciation analysis, are presented in this paper. The trajectory and thickness of the sand/dust is also studied using synoptic weather observations and geostationary meteorological satellite aerosol products. Finally, the forecasting aspect of the sand/dust weather is discussed, from the forecasting by a few days ahead to possibly at the sub-seasonal scale. It turns out that the forecast aerosol concentrations serve as a useful product to hint the occurrence of sand/dust weather in Hong Kong, even though there are still discrepancies between the observed and the forecast values. There is also signature of conditions favourable for sand/dust transport to southern China in model sub-seasonal forecast outputs, and the recurrence of similar synoptic patterns in middle and lower troposhere in late spring (April) in the future may hint the potential of sand/dust weather over Hong Kong again."

 The geometric configuration of building rooftops considerably influences the lightning leader attachment process. However, observational and modeling studies on how rooftop geometries affect this process remain limited, particularly regarding the combined impacts of building height and lightning peak current on striking distances across diverse rooftop designs. To address this gap, a physics-based lightning strike model for tall buildings was developed based on an established three-dimensional variable grid upward leader initiation model. The model incorporated the attachment process between upward and downward leaders. Four representative rooftop geometries were systematically analyzed: flat-top, sloped roof, cuboid-tower, and cylindrical-tower configurations. The results revealed two critical trends: Qie et al. (2024) (1) Striking distances decrease as rooftop geometries approximate flat-top profiles, whereas rod-like configurations exhibit increased striking distances; Xiao et al. (2023) (2) For sloped roofs, those with a vertex angle exceeding 45° exhibit striking distance characteristics similar to flat-top structures under varying peak currents, whereas steeper slopes behave more like rod-type roofs. Empirical correlations between striking distance (D) and peak current (Ip) are derived for 100 m structures: D = 2.27 × IP0.92 (flat-top) and D = 4.29 × IP0.80 (rod-type). Furthermore, two universal patterns emerged: (a) Striking distances and upward leader lengths increase proportionally with building height across all geometries; (b) Rooftop geometry exerts a stronger influence on the attachment process at lower peak currents (20 kA), with diminishing effects at higher peak currents (60 kA).

 A long-standing problem of all numerical weather predictions, regardless deterministic or ensemble, is the more accurate assessment in probability (or likelihood) for the predicted scenario to occur, especially at longer lead times due to typically larger errors. The rapid development of artificial intelligence today may offer an effective method to tackle this issue. In this study, a neural-network machine-learning model is developed to, after training, project the expected value of the similarity skill score (SSS) of predicted total rainfall distribution in Taiwan for westward-moving typhoons during their influence period, thus serving as an objective guidance for the quality of the prediction. Ten typhoons are included, and a total of 105 parameters linked to rainfall are used from time-lagged forecasts (out to 8 days) every 6 h by a cloud-resolving model, when they cover the entire influence period (inside 300 km from Taiwan) with enough lead time. For each typhoon, only data from the other nine cases are used to train the model.The results indicate that machine learning can capture the tendency of the actual SSS (calculated against observed rainfall) for most cases (eight out of ten), thereby informing the forecasters which quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) are more trustworthy and which other ones are less so beforehand. Such guidance is particularly valuable at longer lead times, when the forecast uncertainty is relatively high. Thus, our results are highly encouraging. Nevertheless, if a typhoon behaves differently in forecasts from those that serve as the training data, the outcome would be less useful. Possible directions to remedy this issue and make further improvement are also offered."
