Ibuprofen (IBU) is the most prevalent chiral pharmaceutical in municipal wastewater. However, its enantioselective toxicity toward soil animals and the underlying mechanism remain largely unknown. In this study, the toxicity of IBU enantiomers, S-IBU and R-IBU, to earthworms was evaluated at environmentally relevant concentrations (10 and 100 μg/L), simulating wastewater reuse for irrigation. The results demonstrated that IBU adversely affects the growth, reproduction, regeneration, defense systems, and metabolic processes of earthworms, with S-IBU exhibiting stronger toxic effects than R-IBU. The bioavailability assessment revealed that S-IBU was more readily absorbed by earthworms and converted to its enantiomer within earthworms than R-IBU. This is consistent with molecular docking results showing that S-IBU had stronger affinities for functional proteins associated with xenobiotic transport and transformation. The findings of this study highlight that S-IBU poses a higher risk than R-IBU to soil organisms under wastewater reuse scenarios and that the chirality of chemical pollutants in wastewater deserves more attention when implementing wastewater reuse. In addition, our study underscores that the differences in bioavailability and bioactivity may account for the enantioselective toxicity of chiral pollutants."
10.1021/acsestair.4c00018,True,ACS ES&T Air,这篇论文研究了上海中心大厦不同高度的氨气浓度和氮同位素组成，以及其对2020年中国新冠疫情封锁期间排放量减少的响应。研究利用了世界最高的城市地区原位研究平台——上海中心大厦（632米）上的观测数据。结果表明，氨气浓度和氮同位素组成在各个高度都对封锁措施高度敏感，并且氮同位素的变化与封锁相关的燃烧排放减少相符。尽管氨气来源在垂直方向上没有太大变化，但氨气浓度从地面到混合层顶部（约570米）持续增加。化学传输模型模拟和辅助现场测量数据支持了这一发现，表明城市氨气排放的垂直输送是影响氨气浓度和氮同位素组成垂直分布的重要因素。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它涉及大气成分分析（氨气及其同位素）、空气质量监测（城市氨气污染）以及对污染物垂直分布的观测。,"['Atmospheric composition', 'Ammonia (NH3)', 'Nitrogen isotopes', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Vertical profiling', 'Urban pollution', 'Emission reduction']",Yunhua Chang;Lin Cheng;Haifeng Yu;Jianlin Hu,Concentration and Isotopic Composition of Atmospheric Ammonia Throughout the Urban Mixing Layer in Response to Extreme Emission Reduction,"Here, we investigate the vertical distribution of ammonia (NH3) and its nitrogen isotopic composition (δ15N-NH3) at nine heights along the Shanghai Tower (632 m a.g.l.), the world’s highest in situ research platform in urban areas that we recently established. Both the NH3 levels and δ15N-NH3 values, at all heights, were highly responsive to China’s COVID-19 shutdown, and N isotopic shifts were consistent with the shutdown-associated reduction of combustion-related NH3 emissions in early 2020. Despite the fact that the NH3 source partitioning did not greatly change along the vertical transect, we observed that the abundance of NH3 continuously increased from the ground to the upper mixing layer (∼570 m). Supported by chemical transport-model simulations and auxiliary field measurements, our data indicate that vertical transport of urban NH3 emissions represents an important modulating control with regards to the observed vertical pattern of NH3 concentrations and δ15N-NH3."

The Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project (FishMIP) was established to develop model ensembles for projecting long‐term impacts of climate change on fisheries and marine ecosystems while informing policy at spatio‐temporal scales relevant to the Inter‐Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) framework. While contributing FishMIP models have improved over time, large uncertainties in projections remain, particularly in coastal and shelf seas where most of the world's fisheries occur. Furthermore, previous FishMIP climate impact projections have been limited by a lack of global standardized historical fishing data, low resolution of coastal processes, and uneven capabilities across the FishMIP community to dynamically model fisheries. These features are needed to evaluate how reliably the FishMIP ensemble captures past ecosystem states ‐ a crucial step for building confidence in future projections. To address these issues, we have developed FishMIP 2.0 comprising a two‐track framework for: (a) Model evaluation and attribution of past changes and (b) future climate and socioeconomic scenario projections. Key advances include improved historical climate forcing, which captures oceanographic features not previously resolved, and standardized global fishing forcing to test fishing effects systematically across models. FishMIP 2.0 is a crucial step toward a detection and attribution framework for changing marine ecosystems and toward enhanced policy relevance through increased confidence in future ensemble projections. Our results will help elucidate pathways toward achieving sustainable development goals."

 Paleoclimatic measurements serve to understand Earth System processes and evaluate climate model performances. However, their spatial coverage is generally sparse and unevenly distributed across the globe. Statistical interpolation methods are the prevalent techniques to grid such data, but these purely data-driven approaches sometimes produce results that are incoherent with our knowledge of the physical world. Physics-Informed Neural Networks follow an innovative approach to data analysis and physical modeling through machine learning, as they incorporate physical principles into the data-driven learning process. Here, we develop a machine-learning algorithm to reconstruct global maps of atmospheric dust surface deposition fluxes from paleoclimatic archives for the Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum periods. We design an advection-diffusion equation that prevents dust particles from flowing upwind. Our physics-informed neural network improves on kriging interpolation by allowing variable asymmetry around data points. The reconstructions display realistic dust plumes from continental sources towards ocean basins following prevailing winds.

 Decarbonizing the United States transportation sector has emerged as a critical objective to combat climate change due to its high greenhouse gas emissions, largely from light-duty vehicles. This study assesses the breakdown of life cycle emissions of various transportation options under average and maximum ridership scenarios and quantifies emissions reductions through mode shifts and technology advancements. Electrified transportation achieves half the greenhouse gas emissions of petroleum-fueled options in 2023, with projections indicating a reduction to one-fifth by 2050. Battery systems contribute up to one-fifth of lifetime emissions of electric vehicles and buses as of 2023, and this share is estimated to increase to half by 2050 as electricity emissions are greatly reduced with the decarbonization of electricity. The study concludes that shifting away from light-duty vehicles can achieve near-term greenhouse gas reductions, but these reductions are minimal in the long term when combined with transportation electrification powered by decarbonized electricity. In the United States, electrification can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from passenger transportation by half now and up to 85 percent by 2050 with a decarbonized grid, according to an analysis that uses life cycle assessment and ridership scenarios."

 Offset tracking using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) amplitude imagery is a valuable technique for detecting large ground displacements. However, the traditional offset tracking methods with the SAR datasets are computationally intensive and require significant time for processing. We have developed a novel cross-connection Siamese ResNet (CC-ResSiamNet). The model leverages multi-kernel offset tracking for preprocessing, followed by deep learning architectures that incorporate U-Net, cross-connections, and residual and attention blocks to predict pixel offsets between two SAR amplitude images. It is trained and tested on 200 K pairs of reference and secondary SAR amplitude images, alongside corresponding target offset data from Alaska's glaciers. The comparative analysis with multiple deep learning models confirmed that our designed model is highly generalizable, achieving rapid convergence, minimal overfitting, and high prediction accuracy. Through multi-scenario inference with glacier movements, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions worldwide, the model demonstrates strong performance, closely matching the accuracy of traditional methods while offering significantly faster processing times through parallel computing. The model's rapid displacement mapping capability shows particular promise for improving disaster response and near real-time surface monitoring. While the approach encounters challenges in accurately capturing small-scale displacements, it opens new possibilities for SAR-based surface displacement prediction using machine learning. This research highlights the advantages of combining deep learning with SAR imagery for advancing geophysical analysis, with future applications anticipated as more commercial and scientific SAR missions launch globally."

 Ozone is a crucial greenhouse gas, ranking third only to carbon dioxide and methane, and it regulates the environment and climate change. Researchers' interest in stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) has grown recently, and the increase in tropospheric ozone due to STE processes is particularly important, leading to the excess ozone having a detrimental impact on both population health and the local climate. A major factor driving vertical ozone transport is the re-distribution of vertical momentum resulting from Anticyclonic Wave Breaking (AWB) in the Upper Troposphere Lower Stratosphere (UTLS). However, how the interannual trends of AWB frequency can influence the ozone vertical distribution, and what the interaction mechanism between the two in UTLS are still open questions. Focusing on the Northeast Asia region, where has the greatest influence on near-surface high ozone concentrations in Eastern China, a composite analysis is performed using the ERA5 reanalysis data to discuss the effect of AWB on ozone distribution and its changing trend. The result reveals that, after 2000, AWB frequency (UTLS ozone portion) shows an inter-annual decreasing (increasing) trend. Both are opposite to their inter-annual trends before 2000. i.e. AWB frequency (UTLS ozone portion) shows increasing (decreasing) from 1979 to 2000. Strong anti-correlation of AWB frequency and UTLS ozone portion appears in the upper-troposphere (UT) and lower-stratosphere (LS) before and after 2000, respectively. This phenomenon could be related to the ozone vertical transport weakening caused by declining AWB frequency trends. Additionally, the observed sustained elevation of the tropopause also increases the downward transport distance of stratospheric ozone. The transport of stratospheric ozone to the near-surface seems impeded. Considering the crucial effects of STE on ozone pollution episodes, the long-term changes for the ozone portion in UTLS caused by AWB deserve further study, which can help assess future ozone's potential social and economic effects due to stratospheric intrusion."
10.1016/j.atmosenv.2024.120984,True,Atmospheric Environment,这篇论文研究了中国淄博市挥发性有机物（VOCs）的光化学消耗及其对臭氧（O3）形成的影响。研究发现，光化学消耗的VOCs（C-VOCs）占初始VOCs的比例较高，尤其是在臭氧浓度高的时候。烯烃类VOCs是C-VOCs的主要成分，对臭氧生成潜势（OFP）贡献最大。研究通过多种方法评估了C-VOCs对臭氧生成的影响，结果表明，如果不考虑C-VOCs，会低估NOx限制臭氧生成的比例。研究还建议，要有效降低臭氧浓度，需要采取降低VOCs和NOx的综合策略。总的来说，这项研究强调了在制定臭氧减排策略时考虑光化学消耗VOCs的重要性，这与大气环境遥感技术，特别是空气质量监测和大气成分分析密切相关，因为准确的VOCs和O3浓度数据通常依赖于地面监测和卫星遥感技术。,"['Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)', 'Ozone (O3)', 'Air Quality Monitoring', 'Photochemical Reactions', 'Atmospheric Composition', 'Emission Reduction']",Binqian Fan;Wenting Wang;Chunmei Geng;Bo Xu;Zhenze Song;Yingying Liu;Wen Yang,"Composition of photochemical consumed volatile organic compounds and their impact on ozone formation regime: A case study in Zibo, China","•C-VOCs composition and their impacts on O3formation were assessed. •During high-O3periods, mean C-VOCs concentration was 5.8±8.3 ppbv, 9.5% of In-VOCs. •Alkenes (including isoprene) dominated C-VOCs (84.6%) and C-OFP (91.0%). •The O3formation shifted to the NOx-limited regime after considering C-VOCs. 
 The transport of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to the measurement site leads to significant photochemical consumption, directly impacting ozone (O3) formation. To address this issue, a comprehensive observation campaign was conducted from May 1 to September 30, 2021, in Zibo, China. Using the Framework for 0-D Atmospheric Modeling (F0AM), the impact of photochemical consumed VOCs (C-VOCs) on O3 sensitivity was evaluated based on initial VOCs (In-VOCs). The results indicate that the average concentration of C-VOCs was 5.8 ± 8.3 ppbv, accounting for 9.5% of the In-VOCs concentration during high-O3 periods, which was higher than that during low-O3 periods. Alkenes (including isoprene) contributed 84.6% to the C-VOCs and accounted for 91.0% of the C-OFP (ozone formation potential (OFP) of C-VOCs), followed by aromatics. Isoprene, 1,3-butadiene, m/p-xylene, 1-butene, and propylene were identified as key species contributing to C-OFP. Three methods assessed the impact of including or excluding C-VOCs on O3 formation. Based on the VOCs/NOx indicator, the proportion of the NOₓ-limited regime was underestimated by 14%∼21% for the high-O3 periods and 18%∼21% for the low-O3 periods without considering C-VOCs. Compared to the results of the measured VOCs (M-VOCs), the relative incremental reactivity (RIR) value of NOx increased significantly for both high and low-O3 periods when considering C-VOCs, while the RIR value of anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (AVOC) showed a reverse trend. The RIR(NOx)/RIR(AVOC) results indicated that the O3 formation regime shifted from VOC-limited or transitional to NOx-limited, which is consistent with the result from the empirical kinetic modeling approach (EKMA). Emission reduction modeling suggested reducing AVOC and NOx at a 1:3 ratio as an effective O3 mitigation strategy. This work reveals that the NOx limitation in controlling O3 generation in this region will be underestimated without considering C-VOCs, emphasizing the importance of C-VOCs in the formulation of O3 reduction strategies."

 Typhoons are significant weather phenomena in China, often resulting in floods, inland waterlogging, and significant losses of life and property. Satellite remote sensing techniques provide valuable data on the cloud and precipitation structures of typhoons, as well as their temporal and spatial rainfall distributions. However, there is a notable lack of comprehensive evaluation studies assessing the effectiveness of the new generation Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Level-2 and Level-3 products in monitoring typhoons. In this study, GPM satellite multifrequency microwave imager (GMI) and dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR) data were utilized to analyze the precipitation rate and latent heat vertical distribution characteristics of Typhoon Mujigae (No. 1522), which occurred in 2015. Additionally, the performance of the GPM IMERG (Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM) product (V06) was evaluated based on high-density station precipitation observations. The analysis shows that 2 A-DPR data are valuable for typhoon precipitation monitoring, revealing significant heterogeneity in precipitation rates and latent heat release within typhoons. GPM products capture spatiotemporal rainfall evolution but overestimate low rates and underestimate high rates, with IMERG Final Run notably overestimating regional rainfall. IMERG products show moderate correlation (R: 0.44–0.47) and errors (RMSE: 2.21–2.47 mm/h). Early Run and Late Run products are preferred for their shorter latency and higher accuracy. Evaluations based on dense rain gauge data indicate that increasing the number of stations can help reduce errors and local anomalies, thereby improving the reliability of satellite accuracy assessments."
