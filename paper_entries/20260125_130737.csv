Wood;Zhiguo Yuan;Bernardino Virdis,Extracellular Electron Transfer Enables Methanol Fermentation in Acetogen Eubacterium limosum,"Global warming driven by carbon emissions makes transitioning to a circular carbon economy increasingly urgent. Methanol is a promising energy carrier and a favorable substrate for biotechnology applications due to its high energy conversion efficiency and easy integration with existing infrastructure. Eubacterium limosum has the native ability to convert methanol into valuable chemicals, including acetate, butyrate, and hexanoate. However, oxidized cosubstrates such as CO2 or formate are generally required due to limitations in energy and redox balance. In this study, we demonstrate a novel approach using extracellular electron transfer (EET) with ferric iron (ferrihydrite) as an electron acceptor to enable methanol fermentation without carbon cosubstrates. This ferrihydrite-assisted methanol fermentation yielded a product spectrum like methanol-formate cofermentation, producing more reduced chemicals such as hexanoate. Physiological evidence indicated that cysteine (Cys-SH), an amino acid containing a thiol group (R-SH) and typically included in anaerobic media, was essential in enabling the indirect EET process between E. limosum and ferrihydrite. Thiol regeneration from cystine (Cys–S–S–Cys) confirmed that E. limosum catalyzed the cysteine/cystine recycling. Proteomic analysis revealed the metabolic pathways of this cysteine-mediated EET process. This EET-driven process advances our understanding of microbial carbon cycling and provides a sustainable biotechnology for chemical production."

However, how long-term soil management practices influence these priming effects, and thus their implications for cropland carbon sequestration, remains unclear. Here, we conducted a 70-day incubation by adding polyethylene micro/nanoplastics at environmentally relevant concentrations (0.1, 0.5, and 1% w/w) to soils that had received biochar or straw amendments for 14 years. Using δ13C source partitioning, we found that micro/nanoplastics induced positive priming in control and low-dose biochar soils, driven by dilution from micro/nanoplastic-leached dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which increased bulk DOC and reduced aromaticity. These changes increased microbial biomass, C- and N-acquiring enzyme activities, intensifying nitrogen mining and SOC mineralization. Conversely, negative priming occurred in high-dose biochar soils and in straw-amended soils at the 0.1% micro/nanoplastic rate, where micro/nanoplastic addition reduced bulk DOC and increased aromaticity, likely via preferential sorption of low-aromatic soil DOC onto micro/nanoplastic surfaces. These changes reduced microbial biomass and enzyme activities while promoting the microbial preferential utilization of micro/nanoplastic-leached carbon, thereby favoring SOC preservation. Overall, this study demonstrates that high-dose biochar hinders micro/nanoplastic-induced positive priming by regulating substrate–microbial interactions, with important implications for cropland carbon retention."

We conducted a multicenter panel study with 24 h real-time personal measurements among generally healthy middle-aged and elderly individuals to investigate potential effects of short-term personal exposures to noise and temperature on ST-segment depression event (STDE) and whether the effects of noise are modified by temperature and vice versa. Generalized linear mixed-effect model and stratified analyses were used. A total of 117 eligible participants completed 256 person-visits. We found increased risks of STDE associated with personal noise exposure and U-shaped exposure–effect relationships between personal temperature exposure and risks of STDE, both occurring over minutes to hours. The nonoptimum temperatures, including low and high temperatures, significantly enhanced the adverse effects of noise on STDE. Significant effect modifications on temperature-related STDE risk by noise were found in both the low and high temperature ranges. Exploratory analyses suggested that decreases in heart rate variability variables, reflecting autonomic imbalance, may explain exposure-related STDE occurrence. Our study identified the independent effects and two-way effect modifications of personal noise and temperature exposures on STDE risk, providing novel insights into the pathways linking these environmental factors to adverse cardiovascular outcomes."

However, there is an insufficient understanding of the effect of oxidant dosage on the reaction pathway, and the tuning of the reaction pathway between mineralization and polymerization has not yet been reported. In this study, we report an Fe-doped MoS2/peroxydisulfate (PDS) system for phenolic compounds (PCs) removal. This system undergoes a high-valent iron pathway and has a faster reaction rate when oxidizing PC with a higher electron donating capability. More importantly, we elucidate that a polymerization reaction exists in the Fe-MoS2/PDS system, and the oxidant dosage significantly affects the reaction pathway. Low oxidant dosage facilitates the polymerization reaction process, and high oxidant dosage normally leads to electron transfer-based degradation. It is also found that 2,6-dimethylphenol (DMP), 4-methoxy-phenol (MOP), p-cresol (MP), methylparaben (MeP), and nitrophenol (NP) have a high degree of polymerization trend among the 11 tested PCs, which stems from their polymer products being more easily adsorbed on the catalyst surface. This study demonstrates the wide presence of the polymerization process in the PDS activation system and verifies the impact of oxidant dosage and type of PCs on the transformation of the reaction pathway."

PS NPs exhibit route-specific phytotoxicity: while only high-dose root exposure inhibits photosynthesis, foliar exposure causes sustained inhibition. Importantly, soil-based foliar exposure also inhibits photosynthesis without the PS NP translocation to grains. This foliar-specific inhibition correlates directly with PS accumulation in leaves and is mechanistically attributed to its colocalization with chloroplasts (Pearson’s r = 0.592), as confirmed by confocal imaging in high-dose (35.7 μg PS plant–1 d–1) exposed leaf. The colocalization impairs both the light-dependent reactions and carbon fixation during photosynthesis, as evidenced by significant reductions in photosynthetic pigments (54.4–61.0%), Hill reaction activity (49.9–70.2%), ATP production (22.1–24.3%), net photosynthetic rate (84.5–89.0%), Rubisco activity (84.6–87.5%), stomatal conductance (47.9–69.5%), and transpiration rate (47.4–48.9%). Transcriptomic analysis identifies the genetic basis of this inhibition, showing significant downregulation of the core photosynthesis pathway and key genes for photosynthetic-antenna proteins, carbon fixation, and carotenoid/porphyrin metabolism. These findings provide mechanistic insights into PS NP-induced photosynthesis inhibition and underscore atmospheric NPs as an emerging threat to global food security."

Herein, we conducted a comprehensive NHANES analysis to estimate the Hazard Ratio (HR) of earlier menopause associated with PFOA exposure and further investigated the underlying mechanisms through a prenatal mouse model and complementary cell-based assays. Higher serum PFOA levels were significantly associated with earlier age at natural menopause (2nd tertile: HR = 1.220, P = 0.004; third tertile: HR = 1.262, P = 0.002). In mice, prenatal PFOA exposure caused persistent ovarian dysfunction in middle-aged F1 offspring, characterized by ovarian cyst formation, a premature decline in ovulatory capacity, increased follicular atresia, and disrupted estrous cyclicity. PFOA induced granulosa cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, increasing the arrested population from 84.9% to 87.6%, thereby reducing proliferation as a key contributor to ovarian cyst formation. Transcriptomic profiling and qPCR validation demonstrated that PFOA activated PPARγ signaling, with PPARγ and ANGPTL4 upregulated by 1.6-fold and 12.6-fold, respectively. PFOA exposure further induced upregulation of ANGPTL4 as revealed by siRNA-mediated knockdown assays, which mediated reduced granulosa cell proliferation. Our findings link prenatal PFOA exposure to long-term ovarian toxicity through granulosa cell dysfunction mediated by PPARγ–ANGPTL4 signaling, providing new evidence and potential targets for adverse reproductive outcomes on PFOA."

The interaction effects of lifestyle factors, indoor air pollution, and meteorological conditions with air pollutants have been underexplored. This time-stratified case-crossover study was nested within the China Kadoorie Biobank cohort study of middle-aged and elderly participants from five urban and five rural areas in China spanning from 2004 to 2018. 10,712 participants were included, each with a mean of 2.3 episodes of AECOPD hospitalizations during the observation period. A composite air pollution score was derived through principal component analysis. Short-term exposure to particulate matter and NO2 was positively associated with hospital admissions for AECOPD, with the largest temperature- and humidity-adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 1.101 (1.073, 1.129) at a lag of 1 day for per 1 standard deviation increase in air pollution score. The effect of O3 appeared to be conflicting. The associations were further corroborated by the self-controlled case-series design. Unfavorable body shapes, cold season, and low humidity could exacerbate the influence of air pollution. These findings reinforce the evidence of links between air pollution and AECOPD and implicate the management of body weight and cold and dry circumstances."

Traditional detection methods, albeit important, are limited by single analytical indicators and time-consuming procedures, which lead to distorted detection results for biomarkers with high metabolic rates. Herein, a multiplexed electrochemical sensing array was designed based on nanozyme capsules; this metal-porphyrin-structured covalent–organic framework embedded with enzymes simultaneously detected H2O2, acetylcholine (ACh), and glucose (Glu). The nanozyme capsule not only exhibits peroxidase-like activity for the sensitive detection of H2O2 but also serves as a carrier to encapsulate enzymes within its cavities, forming a cascade catalytic system for the specific recognition of ACh or Glu. This sensor features a broad detection range, low detection limits, and a strong anti-interference capability. More importantly, it can rapidly quantify three easily degradable biomarkers in neuronal lysates within 3 min without pretreatment. With the sensor, we multidimensionally assessed and differentiated the effects of different microplastics (MPs) based on the ability of neurons to produce ACh and H2O2 as well as their glucose uptake capacity. Furthermore, it is found that MPs induce stronger neurotoxic effects under hyperglycemia. This study not only provides an effective tool for determining multiple easily degradable biomarkers but also offers technical support for assessing the health risks of pollutants."

While carboxyl surface modification is known to reduce NP toxicity in some systems, its protective efficacy in intestinal environments remains unclear. This study investigated the comparative effects of pristine PS and PMMA versus their carboxylated derivatives (PS-COOH and PMMA-COOH) on gut dysbiosis in zebrafish larvae. Pathological examination revealed that PS induced the most severe intestinal epithelial damage, which was effectively mitigated by carboxylation. Conversely, PMMA triggered robust gut inflammation, evidenced by significant upregulation of proinflammatory markers IL-1β and NOS2A, effects that persisted despite carboxylation. These differences were correlated with microbiota shifts: PMMA groups significantly enriched opportunistic pathogens (Vibrio and Morganella), while PS-COOH only partially restored microbial balance. Functional analyses identified that carboxylation disrupts key microbial pathways, including amino acid metabolism and NOD-like receptor signaling, which are crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis. The roles of gut microbes were further verified by challenging the microbiota-depleted model with Morganella morganii. Our results demonstrate that polymer composition dictates carboxyl modification efficacy─protective for PS but ineffective for PMMA─highlighting the need for material-specific NP safety assessments."

Using geologic and historic records we find new evidence for ice‐jam flooding at Georgetown during the Little Ice Age, as recently as 1784, that was up to ∼2x the magnitude of the largest events of the past hundred years (1936, 1942). Over the 19th century (a) human modifications to the Potomac estuary as well as (b) increasingly heavy rainfall and (c) land‐clearance in the watershed may have contributed to increasingly frequent large floods at Washington.

This study examines precipitation response to mesoscale SST forcing using satellite observations, ERA5 reanalysis, and high‐ and low‐resolution climate models. The results show that high‐resolution models produce a precipitation response to mesoscale SST consistent with satellite observations and ERA5. However, partitioning ERA5 and model precipitation into resolved and parameterized convective components reveals that even in high‐resolution models, the simulated mesoscale SST‐precipitation relationship is shaped by the characteristics of convective parameterization. Further, the precipitation response to SST is strongly dependent on the background SST and SST variability in coupled models. Further analysis of ERA5 and high‐resolution simulations shows a vertical velocity response extending to 500 hPa. However, the reliance on convective parameterizations introduces uncertainties about whether high‐resolution models accurately capture these effects."

 Polygenic scores (PGS) quantify genetic contributions to complex traits, yet existing single- and multi-ancestry methods lack multi-dimensional evaluation within a unified framework. Here, we benchmarked 13 state-of-the-art PGS methods across 36 traits in UK Biobank European and African samples. The prediction performance, computational efficiency, the number of variants, and the impact of different linkage disequilibrium (LD) reference sizes were thoroughly assessed for each method. Results of single-ancestry methods demonstrate that LDpred2 has superior performance across a broad spectrum of complex traits in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency; however, other methods remain valuable for specific traits. For multi-ancestry methods, PRS-CSx and X-Wing have comparable performance, whereas LDpred2-multi outperforms both. Notably, we find that increasing the panel size of the LD reference significantly elevates PGS performance for sample sizes below 1,000, and it reaches a plateau when it exceeds 5,000 samples. Furthermore, implementing PGS calculation methods requires considerable technical effort and resource allocation. To support easy use of these PGS methods, we developed a user-friendly online computing platform, PGS-hub, that integrates all evaluated methods and is pre-configured with ancestry-stratified LD panels. This resource enables a scalable and harmonized PGS computation platform for the PGS community.

 Reversal tasks have been regarded as probes of behavioural inhibition and linked to prefrontal and specifically orbitofrontal cortex. The centrality of behavioural inhibition to reversal task performance and the task’s dependence on particular prefrontal sub-regions have, however, been questioned in primates. Using a combination of whole brain recording, transient ultrasonic disruption, two types of reversal task, and a task model emphasizing identification of transitions between latent states, we show that male macaques track latent state transitions in addition to choice values in reversal tasks. Activity reflecting both these features is prominent in dorsomedial frontal cortex, and anterior and dorsomedial thalamus when, and just before, animals select choices. By contrast, hippocampal activity continually tracks the probability of a reversal between latent states. We identify patterns of activity interaction spanning the three nodes of this circuit and demonstrate that disruption of each leads to reversal task impairment albeit in different ways. Neural mechanism underlying behavioural flexibility is not fully understood. Here authors study decision-making of macaques in a reversal task. They identify two complementary cognitive processes.

 Existing technologies for chlorine (Cl2) synthesis are generally suffered from low productivity or high production cost. Guided by Bernoulli’s principle, here we report an efficient yet cost-effective electrochemical system for Cl2 electrosynthesis, which is composed of anodic chlorine evolution reaction (CER) connected to gas chamber by triple-phase gas diffusion layer. The key is to modulate gas diffusion layer by Bernoulli’s principle, wherein the pressure difference at triple-phase boundary drives oriented Cl2 migration directly into gas chamber, thus preventing the crossover of anodic/cathodic products. By further joining with a pH-tolerant catalyst, a standalone prototype device is built for high-rate Cl2 production, operating at the Faradaic efficiencies of 96.3% ~ 87.6% in the current density range of 0.1 ~ 1.14 A cm−2, having superior Cl2 synthesis performance. Further technical-economic evaluations of our synthetic scheme demonstrate reduced Cl2 production cost, saving 6.75% (1.17 million dollar per year) as comparison to conventional chlor-alkali design.

 Entanglement, a key feature of quantum mechanics, is recognized for its non-classical correlations which have been shown to provide significant noise resistance in single-photon rangefinding and communications. Drawing inspiration from the advantage given by energy-time entanglement, we developed an energy-time correlated source based on a classical laser that preserves the substantial noise reduction typical of quantum illumination while surpassing the quantum brightness limitation by over six orders of magnitude, making it highly suitable for practical remote sensing applications. A frequency-agile pseudo-random source is realized through fiber chromatic dispersion and pulse carving using an electro-optic intensity modulator. Operating at a faint transmission power of 48 μW, the distance between two buildings 154.8182 m apart can be measured with a precision better than 0.1 mm, under varying solar background levels and weather conditions with an integration time of only 100 ms. These trials verified the predicted noise reduction of this system, demonstrating advantages over quantum illumination-based rangefinding and highlighting its potential for practical remote sensing applications.

 Papaya is a trioecious species with XX females, XY males, and XYh hermaphrodites. Any combination of Y and Yh chromosomes is lethal. The gene underlying YY lethality is pivotal in the transition from stage 2 to stage 3 in sex chromosome evolution. Here, we identify and functionally validate the YY lethality gene in papaya, CpYYL. Loss of CpYYL function accelerates glycolysis and reduces sucrose accumulation in embryo, causing embryo abortion. CpYYL interacts with CpAKRP and overexpression of both genes partially rescues seed abortion in the heterozygous emb506 and akrp mutants, indicating conserved role in plastid differentiation and embryo development. Viable YYh and YhYh plants are generated through genetic engineering and crossing, although both genotypes show high seedling mortality. Crossing YYh male with XX female papaya shows 1:1 ratio of male to hermaphrodite plants without recombination between MSY and HSY. Identification of CpYYL fills a critical gap in papaya sex chromosome evolution, and provides new resources for genomic and epigenetic studies. Papaya is a trioecious species with XX females, XY males, and XYh hermaphrodites, and the combination of Y and Yh chromosomes is lethal. Here, the authors identify the degeneration of the YY lethality gene on the Y chromosome as the causal balancing lethal factor that reenforces dioecy and stabilizes balanced sex ratios."

 Microbial metabolic gene clusters encode the biosynthesis or catabolism of metabolites that facilitate ecological specialization, mediate microbiome interactions and constitute a major source of medicines and crop protection agents. Here, we present BiG-SCAPE and BiG-SLiCE 2.0, next-generation methods that facilitate scalable, accurate and interactive gene cluster analyses. BiG-SCAPE 2.0 updates its classification, alignment methods, and visualizations, enabling more accurate analysis, up to 8x faster runtimes and halved memory requirements. BiG-SLiCE 2.0 updates its distance metric, pHMM database, and classification logic, resulting in increased sensitivity nearing that of BiG-SCAPE. Analysis of 260,630 biosynthetic gene clusters from publicly available genomes reveals that both tools generate concurring estimates of gene cluster diversity, thus providing significantly extended methodological support for recent evidence indicating that the vast majority of natural product diversity remains unexplored. Together, these updates will facilitate global genome mining efforts for natural product discovery and microbiome analyses scalable with current data sizes.

Using structural biology, the authors reveal that sortilin acts as structural sensor of monomeric thyroglobulin, independently of its iodination and hormone content, via binding of a flexible C-terminal peptide. 
 Sortilin is a ubiquitous membrane receptor mediating trafficking of protein cargoes. In the thyroid, sortilin binds thyroglobulin (TG) during its endocytosis, a key process in thyroid homeostasis. Although sortilin has been proposed to recognise highly iodinated TG, the molecular details of this interaction remain unknown. In this work, using an integrative structural biology approach, we reveal that sortilin binds an unstructured TG C-terminal peptide and exhibits a strong preference for the monomeric TG over the commonly known dimeric form. We find that sortilin-TG interaction is independent of the iodination state of TG and instead relies on the conversion to its monomeric state, presumably promoted by extracellular degradation. Furthermore, using AlphaPulldown and sequence analysis, we show that recognition of other reported ligands by sortilin likely relies on similar unstructured peptide motifs, which are not constrained to a single binding orientation within the receptor cavity. Overall, this study reveals the TG-sortilin binding interface and provides insights into the recognition mechanism of other cargoes by sortilin. Sortilin mediates thyroglobulin endocytosis within the thyroid. Using structural biology, the authors reveal that sortilin acts as structural sensor of monomeric thyroglobulin, independently of its iodination and hormone content, via binding of a flexible C-terminal peptide."

This estimate combines satellite observations with a global transport model. 
 The January 2022 eruption of the Hunga volcano (20∘S) injected 150 Tg of water vapour into the middle atmosphere, leading to an increase in the stratospheric water burden of 10%, unprecedented in the observational record. In the first two years post eruption the stratospheric burden hardly changed, leaving the residence time of volcanically injected water vapour, a key control on its climate impact, uncertain. Here, using satellite observations, we show a substantial decline from 2024 to early 2025, the largest drop since the eruption. Comparison with 3-D numerical model simulations shows that the long-term removal of the Hunga water has now entered a new phase, with stratosphere-troposphere exchange playing an increasingly important role, exceeding Antarctic dehydration in 2024. We estimate that the additional stratospheric water vapour is now decaying steadily with an e-folding time of 3 years and will reach the observed pre-Hunga range of variability around 2030.

 The escalating frequency of extreme heatwaves coupled with the deep decarbonization of the power system pose growing challenges to the reliable operation of metropolitan power systems. In megacity clusters, heatwave-induced blackouts leave densely populated and vulnerable communities exposed to prolonged thermal stress, significantly elevating urban health risks. In response, we proposes a health-aware decarbonization framework that integrates meteorology, power systems, and urban health—offering a comprehensive, systems-level solution to support the development of resilient, and sustainable cities under intensifying climate stress. Our results indicate that while decarbonizing the power system is crucial for meeting climate goals, it may unintentionally increase heat-related deaths in large urban areas. In the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao megacity cluster, the number of cities with excess death rates over 3% is expected to rise from 1 in 2030 to 9 by 2050. However, health-aware decarbonization strategies can cut excess deaths by 55.38% -65.01% and reduce total annual costs by 8.71% -13.63%.

 Permafrost degradation causes irreversible damage to Arctic civil infrastructure and threatens the broader pan-Arctic economy. Currently, the lack of community-scale, geomechanics-based mapping of Arctic infrastructure geohazards hinders effective local infrastructure planning. Here, we develop a framework that integrates physics-constrained geotechnical models with a process-based ground thermal model to assess the 21st century changes in thaw settlement and bearing capacity of civil infrastructure foundations at a 30-meter spatial resolution. We find that settlement is accelerating and bearing capacity is decreasing nonlinearly at both regional and local scales. By mid-century, less than 10% of the infrastructure in northern Alaska is projected to be at risk; however, a transition window emerges between the 2060 s and 2080 s. During this transition period, infrastructure risk will increase sharply, and most infrastructures are projected to be at risk. Our results underscore the urgent need for proactive adaptation strategies to protect Arctic infrastructure from permafrost degradation-induced geohazards.

 Rapid Arctic warming is thawing carbon-rich permafrost, releasing greenhouse gases that accelerate climate change. Despite the importance of this feedback, permafrost-enabled global-scale models simulate only gradual, top-down thickening of the seasonally-thawed soil. This ignores abrupt permafrost thaw and intensifying fire regimes that combust soil carbon and further accelerate thaw. Here, we expand a compact Earth system model (OSCAR v3.0) enabling initial estimates of the impacts of abrupt thaw and wildfire, together with gradual thaw, on remaining carbon budgets consistent with the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. Our model suggests that including permafrost thaw and fire-related carbon emissions reduces the remaining allowable carbon budgets from 2025 onward by 25 % ± 12 % for avoiding 1.5 °C and 17 % ± 7 % for avoiding 2.0 °C, relative to simulations without these processes.

 Climate change is shifting the timing of autumnal phenology, with potentially different impacts on leaf coloration and photosynthetic cessation. Here we derive the end of the growing season across northern ecosystems from 2001 to 2021 using satellite-based measures of vegetation greenness, indicating leaf coloration, and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence, indicating photosynthetic activity. We examine temporal changes in the difference between these two metrics and the factors driving these trends. Leaf coloration generally occurred later than photosynthetic cessation, and the difference increased significantly over time. This growing discrepancy was primarily driven by earlier starts of the growing season and rising autumn temperatures. Earlier spring onset influenced autumn timing through its effects on peak growth timing and seasonal carbon uptake, with a stronger impact on photosynthetic cessation than on leaf coloration. Warmer autumn further increased the discrepancy by delaying both processes, slightly more for leaf coloration. This mismatch can intensify respiratory carbon loss, with implications for climate-adaptive forest management.

 Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTSs) are critical indicators of permafrost degradation, with significant implications for ecosystems, infrastructure, and carbon cycling. However, their evolutionary processes remain poorly understood due to limited high-resolution observations. Here, centimeter-scale UAV surveys were conducted from 2019 to 2024 to track eight RTSs on the Tibetan Plateau, with site-specific monitoring frequencies ranging from one to six surveys per year. These RTSs displayed tongue-, trumpet-, or funnel-shaped elongated morphologies with an average aspect ratio of 3.0 and were predominantly north-facing. Their areas, volumes, and headwall heights ranged from 1688.4 to 38,991.9 m2, 594.1 to 51,961.1 m3, and 0.9 to 4.6 m, respectively. Most RTSs featured a three-part structure—rear-edge slumping, mid-slope sliding, and front-edge accumulation—each with distinct deformation characteristics. Two evolutionary pathways of RTS expansion, immediate-triggered and threshold-delayed, were identified. RTS activity was observed from June to October, with the most intense activity occurred between September and late October. Annual and monthly expansion averaged 1182.9 m2 yr−1 and 505.7 m2 mo−1, while headwall retreat reached 14.5 m yr−1 and 6.2 m mo−1. Surface elevation exhibited rear-edge subsidence (mean 2.4 m), central uplift (mean 1.4 m), and stable front-edge, with net volume loss mainly due to subsidence (mean 81%). Surface movement decreased from the rear-edge to the front-edge, with maximum values at the rear-edge slumping zone. This study quantified the evolution of small-scale RTSs—including changes in area, headwall retreat, surface movement, elevation, and volume—particularly focusing on monthly dynamics, thereby enhancing understanding and impact assessment of RTS."

 Belowground properties, including belowground microbial communities and physicochemical characteristics, play a crucial role in ecosystem functioning. Developing scalable approaches to map these properties across large spatial domains is essential for advancing our understanding of ecosystem functioning. However, large-scale approaches for mapping belowground properties, particularly in vegetated ecosystems, have yet to be developed. In this study, we aimed to develop approaches to map belowground microbial communities (bacterial and fungal) and physicochemical characteristics in an extensive grassland ecosystem affected by invasive plants using airborne and spaceborne imaging spectroscopy (hyperspectral remote sensing). We focused on Lespedeza cuneata (L. cuneata), an invasive plant threatening grasslands of the U.S. Southern Great Plains. We developed structural equation models to determine aboveground-belowground linkages. We used airborne hyperspectral data to estimate aboveground characteristics from partial least squares regression and then mapped belowground properties using aboveground characteristics through generalized joint attribute models. We also assessed the capability of spaceborne data in mapping the spatial distribution of belowground properties through fusing coarse spatial resolution DLR's DESIS hyperspectral data with fine spatial resolution PlanetScope multispectral data. Our findings showed that there are linkages between percent cover of L. cuneata, aboveground characteristics, and belowground properties. Large-scale analysis using airborne hyperspectral data showed that belowground properties varied across increasing percent cover of L. cuneata. Similar results were observed when using fused spaceborne data. Our findings indicated that (1) spectral information can reveal belowground properties and (2) fusing spaceborne data can be an effective approach to mapping belowground properties in grassland ecosystems."

 River network selection is essential for generating multiscale river network datasets used in earth observation (EO) applications, such as hydrological analysis and terrain modeling. However, how individual river features influence selection decisions, especially across different drainage patterns, remains unclear. To address this gap, this study introduces an explainable artificial intelligence framework that integrates eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to uncover feature contributions for river network selection across different patterns. First, river strokes were constructed as analytical units and multiple geometric, topological, and hydrological features were extracted. Then, XGBoost-based selection models were trained for the parallel and rectangular drainage networks. Finally, the macro-, meso-, and micro-level SHAP analysis was conducted over the trained selection models. The experimental results reveal that features fall into three categories for the two types of patterns considered here: universal features (represented by upstream cumulative area, Horton code) that dominate selection regardless of pattern; pattern-sensitive features (represented by confluence angle, river proximity distance) whose influence varies with drainage patterns; and low-contribution features with negligible contribution. These findings explain why certain rivers are retained or removed across different drainage patterns, providing explainable insights to support automated, pattern-preserving generation of multiscale river networks."

 The emergence of vision language models (VLMs) bridges the gap between vision and language, enabling multimodal understanding beyond traditional visual-only deep learning models. However, transferring VLMs from the natural image domain to remote sensing (RS) segmentation remains challenging due to the large domain gap and the diversity of RS inputs across tasks, particularly in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) and referring expression segmentation (RES). Here, we propose a training-free unified framework, termed DGL-RSIS, which decouples visual and textual representations and performs visual-language alignment at both local semantic and global contextual levels. Specifically, a Global–Local Decoupling (GLD) module decomposes textual inputs into local semantic tokens and global contextual tokens, while image inputs are partitioned into class-agnostic mask proposals. Then, a Local Visual–Textual Alignment (LVTA) module adaptively extracts context-aware visual features from the mask proposals and enriches textual features through knowledge-guided prompt engineering, achieving OVSS from a local perspective. Furthermore, a Global Visual–Textual Alignment (GVTA) module employs a global-enhanced Grad-CAM mechanism to capture contextual cues for referring expressions, followed by a mask selection module that integrates pixel-level activations into mask-level segmentation outputs, thereby achieving RES from a global perspective. Experiments on the iSAID (OVSS) and RRSIS-D (RES) benchmarks demonstrate that DGL-RSIS outperforms existing training-free approaches. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each module. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first unified training-free framework for RS image segmentation, which effectively transfers the semantic capability of VLMs trained on natural images to the RS domain without additional training."

 Leaf Water Content (LWC) is vital for assessing winter wheat growth. Due to spectral band sensitivity variations, improving spectral feature fitting through preprocessing and optimization is a challenging issue. This study systematically investigates wavelength-dependent LWC sensitivity under multiple preprocessing operators to identify spectral bands highly correlated with winter wheat LWC under different preprocessing methods and evaluate band replacement (representation selection at fixed wavelength) and fusion strategies (constrained union within the same feature-selection method with wavelength de-duplication) for optimizing feature combinations and enhancing model accuracy and robustness. Various feature extraction techniques were applied to identify LWC-correlated spectral bands. Bands replacement (producing “Replacement Features”) and constrained feature fusion (producing “Fusion Features”) were introduced for feature optimization. Multiple modeling methods were employed to assess LWC monitoring performance using initial, replaced, and fused feature sets under a consistent train–test split with training-set cross-validation. The combination of first derivative (FD) preprocessing, Iterative Variable Subset Optimization (IVSO) feature selection, and Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) modeling yielded the best monitoring results. Fusion Features selected by IVSO achieved the highest accuracy, evaluated by R2, RMSE, and Akaike information criterion (AIC) (R2Train = 0.960, RMSETrain = 0.016, AICTrain = -1010.061; R2Test = 0.956, RMSETest = 0.015, AICTest = -98.362). Both band replacement and fusion enhanced model robustness and addressed spectral sensitivity issues. This study demonstrated the importance of preprocessing, feature optimization, and modeling in improving LWC monitoring. The proposed multi-preprocessing representation replacement and constrained fusion framework improved LWC estimation accuracy, supporting precision agriculture for winter wheat."

 High-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) are critical for applications such as environmental monitoring and urban planning, motivating the development of advanced DEM super-resolution (SR) techniques. While recent methods have shown promising results, effectively exploiting high-resolution remote sensing images (HRSIs) to guide DEM SR remains challenging, and progress has been hindered by the lack of large-scale, open-source benchmark datasets. We propose GSRMTL, a novel and parameter-efficient multi-task learning framework for HRSI-guided DEM SR. Given a low-resolution DEM and a paired HRSI, GSRMTL jointly performs DEM SR and semantic segmentation of the optical imagery, where segmentation acts as an auxiliary task to provide semantic priors for elevation reconstruction. To address the dataset bottleneck, we introduce GDEMSR, the first large-scale benchmark dataset specifically designed for HRSI-guided DEM SR. Extensive experiments on GDEMSR and the RGB-guided depth SR benchmark NYU-v2 demonstrate that GSRMTL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods while using significantly fewer parameters, highlighting its effectiveness and practical deployment potential."

Recent trends in PM<sub>2.5</sub> in rural environments in metropolitan France,"•Decreasing trends in daily PM2.5at French rural sites at −5.6 % year−1in 2014–2021. •Decrease in PM2.5emissions in the footprint aligned with that in PM2.5observations. •Trends in de-weathered, de-weathered & deoxidises PM2.5closer to that in emissions. •Lack of linearity between NOXemissions and nitrate at the north sites of France. 
 Trends in daily PM2.5 concentrations were assessed at 5 rural background sites in France in 2014–2021, together with major particulate components which concentrations were attributed to (i) anthropogenic emissions including fossil fuels (FF) and biomass burning (BB) from primary emissions; and (ii) secondary particulate constituents including non-sea-salt sulphate, nitrate and ammonium. Annual PM2.5 concentrations correlated to annual emissions in both SO2 and NOX in France at all sites; correlations to primary PM2.5 emissions varied depending on the site. To disentangle the influence of weather, long-range transport, and the conditions controlling for PM secondary formation on the PM2.5 time series, boosted regression tree (BRT) models were built at each site for PM2.5; and normalised time series calculated by randomising the value of the explanatory variables at a given time. Two BRT models with their respective normalised PM2.5 time series were calculated: de-weathered time series (without the influence of the meteorological and long-range transport) and de-weathered & de-oxidised time series (randomisation of meteorology, transport and OX (NO2 + O3) concentrations). In 2014–2021, PM2.5 decreased at −5.6 % year−1, almost twice as fast as changes in primary emissions in France and neighbouring countries (about −3 % year−1). Overall trends in de-weathered, and de-weathered and de-oxidised PM2.5 were lower than that in PM2.5 observations, at −3.9 % year−1 and -3.2 % year−1, respectively. Trends in de-weathered & de-oxidised PM2.5 were close to those in emissions, demonstrating the role of including variables capturing the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere in the normalising techniques to compare trends in PM2.5 with primary emissions. Faster downward rates in PM2.5 aerosols in rural background in mainland France were mostly associated with the decrease in gas emissions responsible for secondary particles and less sensitive to changes in primary emissions. Control of NH3 emissions is suggested to be crucial to ensure downward trends in PM2.5 at the regional background environments to reduce concentrations closer to WHO limits."

 Aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI) for marine-continental mixed aerosols (MCMA) in coastal zones remain poorly constrained in climate models. Combining aircraft observations and WRF simulations during a spring 2023 North China precipitation event, we demonstrate distinct vertical stratification: MCMA dominates below 3000 m with variable activation (4.2 %) due to compositional complexity, while continental aerosols (CA) prevail above 3000 m with lower activation (2.1 %) from homogeneous properties. MCMA's broader size distribution (enhanced giant aerosols >0.5 μm), yielding higher cloud droplet concentrations (Nc) but lower spectral dispersion (ε) than CA (Nc = 96.6 cm−3, ε = 0.263 vs. Nc = 57.5 cm−3, ε = 0.375). Integrating observed aerosol data into WRF revealed that parameterizing ε-Nc relationships under MCMA improves cloud microphysics representation, capturing cloud-water mixing ratios (up to 0.44 g kg−1) and precipitation patterns. Results highlight the critical role of aerosol mixing states in modulating cloud processes and necessitate refined parameterizations for coastal aerosols in climate models."

 The LMA network SAETTA has observed thunderstorms from 2014 to 2023. During this period, 54 thunderstorm days with negative dipole charge structures were observed during African dust flow events over the Corsica island, mainly during the warm season. The spatial and temporal distribution of thunderstorm days provided by SAETTA data shows nocturnal events with negative dipole charge structure, without preferential regions (even on land and on sea), while classic thunderstorms over Corsica with normal tripole charge structure occur mainly over mountains in the daytime. In the case of negative dipole events, METEORAGE data show more intense and frequent +CG lightning flashes than classical thunderstorms, and 89.4% of -IC lightning flashes. Furthermore, ERA-5,reanalysis data and radiosonde data exhibit dry and warm low layers, with a temperature inversion near the surface, forcing the triggering of elevated convection. This observation could be a consequence of the radiative impact of Saharan dust. This study shows no evidence for the microphysical impact of aerosols, i.e. the multiplication of ice crystals despite supercooled water droplets. Meteorological data also exhibit intense wind speeds associated with negative dipole thunderstorms."

 Although Yunnan, located in southwestern China, is recognized as a transitional zone between the Indian Summer Monsoon and the East Asian Monsoon, the extent to which distinct moisture sources and associated transport pathways influence precipitation isotopic variability in this region remains poorly quantified. Here, we analyzed a four-and-a-half-year precipitation isotope dataset from Kunming and differentiated between precipitation sourced from the Bay of Bengal (BoB) and the South China Sea (SCS). We observe a strong seasonal δ18O contrast of 7.4‰ in BoB-sourced precipitation, which accounts for ∼61% of the moisture supply for Kunming precipitation. In contrast, SCS-sourced precipitation exhibits a weak seasonality of only 1.8‰ in δ18O. Our analysis indicates that seasonal changes of evaporative conditions in BoB source and upstream meteorology along its transport path produce this pattern, while relatively stable SCS source and transport conditions result in minimal seasonal variability. Simulation results demonstrate that SCS-sourced δ18O largely follows Rayleigh distillation, whereas BoB-sourced δ18O deviates from this simple model, indicating the influence of additional processes. We further find that the tropospheric temperature gradient is a key thermodynamic driver of precipitation δ18O, showing a persistent negative correlation across seasons and moisture sources. In addition, precipitation d-excess responds differently to the two moisture sources. D-excess in BoB-sourced precipitation partially reflects source-region and transport-path conditions, while SCS-sourced precipitation shows no such consistent relationships. Overall, this work quantifies the distinct isotopic fingerprints of these two major moisture sources to southwestern China, providing an advance for modeling regional water cycles and interpreting isotopic paleoclimate archives."
