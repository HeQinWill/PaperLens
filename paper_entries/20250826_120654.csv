Our study has revealed that both city size and building density play pivotal roles in modulating thunderstorm and lightning activity. This research not only deepens our understanding of urban meteorology but also lays an important foundation for developing accurate and targeted urban thunderstorm risk prediction models. 
 The urban underlying surface may have a significant impact on thunderstorm processes and lightning activities, but there is still a lack of explanation of the mechanism. Through a comparative analysis of cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning location datasets in three cities of varying sizes in China, it was observed that for small cities, CG activities tend to cluster towards the city center, whereas in large cities, CG activities tend to accumulate in the city periphery. Radar echoes indicated the occurrence of a significant barrier effect as the thunderstorm that occurred on 13 July 2017 (“0713” case) passed over Beijing's built-up area. An analysis of ground observations revealed that when this thunderstorm passed over the rough urban underlying surface, a separation of the near-surface cold pool emerged. This separation led to the weakening of vertical airflow and the breakdown of the convergence line, ultimately triggering the bifurcation and movement of the thunderstorm. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) numerical simulations have facilitated our further exploration into the potential mechanism of the barrier effect. When a portion of the built-up area was replaced with bare land, the separation of the cold pool and the breakdown of the convergence line were notably mitigated.  Additionally, the building density could also influence the evolution of the cold pool and convergence line. Consequently, the urban underlying surface might be a potentially crucial factor affecting the thunderstorm processes and CG activities. Our findings provide crucial scientific insights for refined forecasting, early warning, and risk assessment of lightning disasters, strategy formulation for urban disaster prevention and mitigation, and resilient city planning and development."
10.5194/acp-25-9199-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注利用沉降测量数据反演大气中放射性物质的释放源。虽然论文中没有直接提及空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析等大气环境遥感技术，但其核心方法——大气传输模型和反演建模——与大气环境遥感领域密切相关。论文通过分析2017年106Ru放射性同位素的释放事件，展示了如何利用沉降数据定位放射性物质的释放源，并与使用空气浓度数据进行对比。这对于监测和追踪大气中的污染物，尤其是在无法直接获取空气浓度数据的情况下，提供了一种替代方案。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术具有间接但重要的联系。,"['radioactive isotope', 'atmospheric transport', 'deposition measurements', 'air concentration', 'inverse modeling', 'source reconstruction', 'radionuclide']",Stijn Van Leuven;Pieter De Meutter;Johan Camps;Piet Termonia;Andy Delcloo,Source reconstruction via deposition measurements of an undeclared radiological atmospheric release,"We use deposition measurements to trace the source of the radioactive isotope 106Ru released into the atmosphere in 2017, which led to detections in Europe and other parts of the Northern Hemisphere. Most frequently, measurements of air concentration are used for such purposes. Our research shows that, while air concentration data can provide more precise results, deposition measurements can still effectively pinpoint the release location, offering a less costly and more versatile alternative. 
 Inverse modelling of atmospheric releases of radioactivity consists of reconstructing the release source by combining radiological field measurements with atmospheric transport calculations. This is typically performed with air concentration measurements, although deposition measurements or gamma dose rate measurements could also be used. In this paper, we assess the use of deposition measurements of radioactivity in this context. This is done through a case study of the undisclosed release of the radionuclide 106Ru in Eurasia during the autumn of 2017. The atmospheric transport model we utilize for this purpose is FLEXPART. Inverse modelling is performed with the inverse modelling tool FREAR (Forensic Radionuclide Event Analysis and Reconstruction), which has been modified to work with deposition measurements. The inversion consists of Bayesian and cost-function-based algorithms to reconstruct the initial source properties. Inverse modelling is applied to both real and synthetic-deposition data following the 106Ru release. We also construct synthetic air concentration data for use in inverse modelling to make a comparison with the results using deposition data. It is found that source localization is feasible with both the synthetic and real-world deposition data. Synthetic air concentration measurements lead to more precise source localization than deposition. It is demonstrated that this can be explained by the lower detection limits of air concentration measurements compared to deposition."
10.5194/acp-25-9183-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该论文主要研究了在太阳活动低迷时期，辐射带高能电子沉降对D区电离层夜间效应的定量分析。它利用中国地震电磁卫星（CSES-01）的数据，研究了高能电子沉降如何影响D区电离层的反射高度，以及这种影响在南北半球和不同季节的差异。虽然涉及卫星观测，但其重点在于磁层和电离层之间的耦合以及对无线电波传播的影响，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、大气成分分析等）的关联性不强。,"['D-region ionosphere', 'energetic electron precipitation', 'ELF waves', 'CSES-01 satellite', 'magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling', 'radio wave propagation']",Xuan Dong;Shufan Zhao;Li Liao;Wei Xu;Ruilin Lin;Xiaojing Sun;Shengyang Huang;Yatong Cui;Jinlei Li;Hengxin Lu;Xuhui Shen,Quantitative analysis of nighttime effects of radiation  belt energetic electron precipitation on the D-region ionosphere during lower solar activity periods,"Energetic electron precipitation (EEP) from the magnetosphere into the Earth's atmosphere can significantly alter the electron density in the D-region ionosphere, impacting its reflective properties and the effectiveness of low-frequency radio wave transmission. A comprehensive understanding of the influence of EEP on the D-region ionosphere can enhance predictive models of ionospheric behavior and mitigate the impacts of space weather. 
 Energetic electron precipitation (EEP) from the Earth's radiation belts can ionize neutral molecules in the D-region ionosphere (60–90 km altitude), significantly influencing the conductivity and chemical species therein. However, due to the limited resolution of space-borne instruments, the energy and fluxes of electrons that truly precipitate into the atmosphere still remain poorly investigated. To resolve this problem, in this study, we have utilized the wave and particle data measured by the Electric Field Detector (EFD) and High-Energy Particle Detector (HEPP) on board the China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES-01) during nighttime conditions between 2019 and 2021. Using the measurements of extremely low frequency (ELF) waves, we have derived the reflection height of the D-region ionosphere, which turn out to be highly consistent with the electron and X-ray measurements of the CSES. Our results show that the influence of EEP on the two hemispheres is asymmetric: the reflection height in the Northern Hemisphere is in general lowered by 2.5 km, while that in the Southern Hemisphere is lowered by 1.5 km, both of which are consistent with first-principles chemical simulations. We have also found that the decrease in reflection height exhibits strong seasonal variation, which appears to be stronger during wintertime and relatively weaker during summertime. This seasonal difference is likely related to the variation of the background ionospheric electron density. Our findings provide a quantitative understanding of how EEP influences the lower ionosphere during solar minimum periods, which is critical for understanding the magnetosphere–ionosphere coupling and assessing the impact on radio wave propagation."

Thus, it is important to know what constrains the lifetime. In this paper, we characterise the two most important contrail dissolution processes via their respective timescales. Both timescales are in the order of a couple of hours, depending on the synoptic situation and the size of the contrail ice crystals. The combined timescale, which combines both processes, is the harmonic mean of the two single timescales. 
 Contrail lifetime is constrained mainly by the sedimentation of ice crystals into lower levels that are subsaturated, by the blowing out of the ice crystals from the parent ice-supersaturated regions (ISSRs) as a result of the (horizontal) wind and by the reduction in supersaturation down to subsaturation due to large-scale subsidence. The first of these processes can be characterised by a sedimentation timescale. The second and third processes can together be characterised by a synoptic timescale. The synoptic timescale is determined in this paper by trajectory calculations for air parcels that initially reside in ice-supersaturated regions and which leave these either with the wind or where the ice supersaturation itself vanishes. It is crucial to know the timescales of contrails because their individual effect on the climate depends on their lifetime. The distinction between the two timescales is particularly important for planning flights that use alternative fuels, in order to mitigate contrail effects. This works in particular if sedimentation is the predominant contrail termination process – that is, if the sedimentation timescale is shorter than the synoptic one. Here we show that both timescales are of the order of a few hours. Actually, in nature, the three mentioned processes act simultaneously. The combined timescale is half of the harmonic mean of the two timescales in separation. Furthermore, we found as a side result that ISSRs emerge only in areas where the normalised geopotential height Z∗ is at least 0.98. For contrail-avoiding flight planning, this means that contrail avoidance in regions with Z∗ < 0.98 is not necessary."
10.5194/acp-25-9249-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注大气中由植物排放的柠檬烯与污染物反应后形成的有机硝酸盐（ONs），以及不同氧化路径如何影响这些有机硝酸盐的形成。研究通过详细的化学机制模型，探讨了臭氧（O3）、羟基自由基（OH）和硝酸根自由基（NO3）引发的氧化路径对柠檬烯衍生的有机硝酸盐生成的影响。虽然该研究与大气成分有关，并涉及空气质量和气候影响，但它侧重于化学反应过程的模拟和理解，而不是直接使用或开发大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析技术。,"['organonitrates', 'secondary organic aerosols', 'limonene', 'oxidation pathways', 'chemical mechanisms', 'air quality', 'climate effects']",Qinghao Guo;Haofei Zhang;Bo Long;Lehui Cui;Yiyang Sun;Hao Liu;Yaxin Liu;Yunting Xiao;Pingqing Fu;Jialei Zhu,Competing multiple oxidation pathways shape atmospheric limonene-derived organonitrates simulated with updated explicit chemical mechanisms,"Limonene, a natural compound from plants, reacts with pollutants to form airborne particles that influence air quality and climate. Using advanced models with explicit chemical mechanisms, we show how different reaction pathways shape organonitrate formation, with some increasing and others decreasing particle levels. This approach enhances predictions of pollution and climate impacts while deepening our understanding of how natural and human-made emissions interact in the atmosphere. 
 Organonitrates (ONs) are key components of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) with potential environmental and climate effects.  However, ON formation from limonene, a major monoterpene with unique structure, and its sensitivity to oxidation pathways remain insufficiently explored due to the absence of models with explicit chemical mechanisms.  This study advances the representation of limonene-derived ON formation by incorporating 90 gas-phase reactions and 39 intermediates across three oxidation pathways (O3, OH, NO3) into both a chemical box model and a global model. Box model sensitivity experiments revealed that competition among major oxidation pathways, coupled with the high yield of limonene-derived ON from O3-initiated oxidation, leads to increased limonene-derived ON production when the O3-initiated pathway is enhanced, whereas strengthening the OH- or NO3-initiated pathways reduces ON formation. Compared to the box model, the global simulation exhibits stronger nonlinear responses and great spatiotemporal variability in limonene-derived ON formation across different oxidation pathways. This is primarily driven by the complex distribution of precursors and oxidants, as well as the change in dominate chemical pathways under various meteorological conditions. In the presence of the other two pathways, increasing the O3- or NO3-initiated oxidation pathway reduces the global limonene-derived ON burden by 19.9 % and 17.3 %, respectively, whereas enhancing the OH-initiated pathway increases it by 44.7 %. Limonene-derived ON chemistry developed in this study not only enhances the global model's ability to simulate ON formation evaluated through comparison with observations but also demonstrates an approach based on explicit chemical mechanisms that establishes a methodological framework for simulating the chemical formation processes of SOA."
10.5194/amt-18-3959-2025,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,该研究论文介绍了一种新型气溶胶过滤器采样器，用于测量冰核粒子（INPs）的垂直分布，该采样器通过固定翼无人机搭载。论文重点介绍了采样器的设计、测试和验证过程，以及在芬兰萨马尔通图里全球大气观测站附近进行的飞行实验。通过比较无人机采集的样本和地面采集的样本，验证了该采样器的技术可行性，并发现两者之间存在差异。该研究与大气环境遥感技术相关，因为它利用无人机作为平台来监测大气成分，特别是气溶胶和冰核粒子的分布，这对于理解云的形成和气候变化至关重要，也与空气质量监测相关。,"['aerosol particles', 'ice-nucleating particles (INPs)', 'vertical distribution', 'uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs)', 'filter sampler', 'atmospheric composition', 'air quality monitoring']",Alexander Böhmländer;Larissa Lacher;David Brus;Konstantinos-Matthaios Doulgeris;Zoé Brasseur;Matthew Boyer;Joel Kuula;Thomas Leisner;Ottmar Möhler,A novel aerosol filter sampler for measuring the vertical distribution of ice-nucleating particles via fixed-wing uncrewed aerial vehicles,"Clouds and aerosol are important for weather and climate. Typically, pure water cloud droplets stay liquid until around −35 °C, unless they come into contact with ice-nucleating particles (INPs). INPs are a rare subset of aerosol particles. Using uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), it is possible to collect aerosol particles and analyse their ice-nucleating ability. This study describes the test and validation of a sampling set-up that can be used to collect aerosol particles onto a filter. 
 A mobile sampler for collecting aerosol particles on an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) was developed and tested during three consecutive Pallas cloud experiment campaigns in the vicinity of the Sammaltunturi Global Atmosphere Watch site (67°58′ N, 24°7′ E, 565 m above sea level) in Finland. The sampler is designed to collect aerosol particles onto Nuclepore filters, which are subsequently analysed for the temperature-dependent number concentration of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) of the sampled aerosol using a freezing assay. The sampler was flown with a fixed-wing UAV in different altitudes up to 1000 m above ground level (a.g.l). The total flight times ranged from 60 min to around 100 min, depending on environmental conditions. Pressure, temperature and relative humidity were also measured to provide information about the meteorological flight conditions. The flow over the filter was maintained by a micro-diaphragm pump, providing approximately 10 standard litres per minute over a small filter (diameter of 25 mm) and around 11 standard litres per minute over a larger filter (diameter of 47 mm) at a pressure corresponding to 500 m above sea level. For a typical flight time of 1.5 h, this results in a sampled air volume of approximately 930 to 1000 standard litres per flight, giving an INP detection limit of approximately 1.1×10-3 and 1.0×10-3 INPs per standard litre, respectively. For comparison to the flight results, a similar set-up was deployed at ground level. The comparison shows a clear distinction from the water and handling blank background for both set-ups, proving the technical feasibility of the set-ups. Furthermore, for some flights, a shift between the two INP populations can be seen, indicating that ground-based INP measurements deviate from the samples collected on board the UAV."

The current study constructed an instrumental system (HEAC (high-efficiency aerosol collector)/ESI (electrospray ionisation)-Orbitrap-MS (mass spectrometer)) for the real-time chemical analysis of aerosol samples. The combined system successfully identified over 30 chemical compounds in aerosol samples in real time, showing the robustness of the technique for the chemical characterisation of aerosols under atmospherically relevant conditions. 
 The chemical properties of aerosols in the atmosphere significantly influence their impact on the global climate forcing and human health. However, a real-time molecular-level characterisation of aerosols remains challenging due to the complex nature of their chemical composition.  The current study constructed an instrumental system for the real-time chemical characterisation of aerosol particles. The proposed setup consists of a custom-built high-efficiency aerosol collector (HEAC) used to collect aerosol samples into a working fluid and an electrospray ionisation (ESI) Orbitrap mass spectrometer (MS) for the subsequent chemical analysis of the liquid sample. The HEAC/ESI-Orbitrap-MS was calibrated against six chemical compounds – vanillic acid (VA), adonitol, erythritol, tricarballylic acid (TCA), sucrose, and trehalose – to investigate the system's sensitivity and limit of detection (LOD). Results showed that the coupled system has high sensitivities to the tested chemical compounds and a similar, if not better, LOD than other related instrumental techniques. The 3σ LOD of the tested compounds ranged from 1.1 ± 0.14 ng m−3 (erythritol) to 65 ± 7.4 ng m−3 (TCA). The capability of the HEAC/ESI-Orbitrap-MS system to identify the chemical composition of organic aerosols (OAs) was also examined. Sample OA was generated by α-pinene ozonolysis, and the chemical characterisation results were compared to similar studies. Our data showed that the HEAC/ESI-Orbitrap-MS system can identify most of the α-pinene ozonolysis products reported in the literature, including cis-pinonic acid, pinalic acid, and 3-methyl-1,2,3-butanetricarboxylic acid (MBTCA). Monomeric and dimeric reaction products were accurately identified in the mass spectra, even at a total OA mass concentration < 2 µg m−3. The present study showed that the HEAC/ESI-Orbitrap-MS system is a robust technique for the real-time chemical characterisation of OA particles under atmospherically relevant conditions."

Canadell;Anna Lintern;Clement Duvert,"OzRiCa: An Australian riverine carbon database of concentrations, gas fluxes and isotopes","Rivers and streams play a key role in how carbon moves through the environment, but we know little about this in Australia. To help close this gap, we compile the first national database of carbon data from rivers and streams, combining past studies, government records, and new data. The data show where and when carbon was measured and reveal major gaps in long-term monitoring. This new resource will help scientists understand carbon and water systems across Australia. 
 Understanding carbon (C) cycling in riverine ecosystems is crucial for accurate estimates of regional and global C budgets. However, the slow progress in identifying spatial and temporal patterns and drivers of riverine C has been largely driven by limited data availability. This lack of information is particularly acute in Australia. To address this issue, we compile the first comprehensive database (OzRiCa) of concentrations, stable isotopes, and fluxes of particulate organic C (POC), dissolved organic (DOC) and inorganic C (DIC), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) for streams and rivers across Australia, along with concurrent physical and chemical data. The OzRiCa database contains 54,843 observations from 2,879 unique sites derived from state agencies, scientific publications, and newly collected, previously unpublished data. The measurements span the period between 1966 to 2024. The database reveals that most observations and sites are located in the Mediterranean, temperate and subtropical regions of the country, with fewer data in semi-arid and tropical regions. We also highlight patterns in temporal data coverage, with half of the sites limited to a single measurement. The scarcity of long-term and high-resolution temporal data for CO2 and CH4, along with the limited number of direct measurements for DIC and CO2, emphasises the need for more direct, frequent and long-term monitoring efforts to capture the extreme temporal variability of Australian climatic regions. We also identify limited stable isotopic data and concurrent measurement of multiple C species, both limiting our ability to better understand C sources and sinks, as well as in-stream C processes. Future research should prioritise these critical gaps to improve our understanding of riverine C dynamics in Australia. OzRiCa provides a baseline for future research, paving the way for studies of fluvial C fluxes at regional, national, and global scales. This database will also be a valuable resource to studying ecosystem health, water quality, and other biogeochemical processes."

Many experiments did not reflect real-world conditions, especially for deeper soils and realistic temperature ranges. Simulation experiments showed that both carbon properties and environmental constraints equally drive temperature sensitivity. Current climate models miss these patterns, but our findings can help improve predictions of soil carbon responses to warming. 
 Microbial decomposition of soil organic carbon (SOC) is a major source of atmospheric CO2 and a key component of climate-carbon feedbacks. Understanding how SOC mineralization responds to temperature is essential for improving climate projections. Here, we compiled a global dataset of laboratory incubation experiments measuring SOC mineralization across diverse soils and temperature regimes. The dataset reveals that 84 % of samples originated from surface soils (0–30 cm), and 50 % of incubations lasted fewer than 50 days. Incubation temperatures ranged from –10 to 60 °C, with temperature intervals used to estimate temperature sensitivity (Q10) spanning 2–40 °C; notably, 81 % of Q10 estimates were based on intervals exceeding 5 °C. Moreover, in 61 % of cases, the lower incubation temperature for Q10 estimation differed from the mean annual temperature at the sampling site by more than 5 °C, indicating a mismatch with in situ conditions. Our analysis highlights critical gaps in current experimental designs, particularly the underrepresentation of subsoils (>30 cm) and the use of temperature ranges that deviate from field conditions. We further evaluated the ability of 16 temperature response functions used in 69 Earth System Models to capture SOC mineralization patterns. Most models failed to reproduce empirical temperature response, especially at higher temperatures, albeit multi-term exponential functions showed relatively better performance. By coupling our dataset with a two-pool carbon model, we found that external environmental constraints and the intrinsic temperature response (including SOC decomposability and microbial processes) similarly influence the temperature sensitivity of SOC mineralization at the global scale, with their relative importance varying across ecosystem types. Our findings underscore the need for incubation experiments that better represent field conditions—both in depth and temperature range—and call for improved model parameterizations to enhance SOC feedback projections under future climate scenarios.

Tree birth, growth, and death and the underlying physiological processes such as carbon assimilation, water transpiration, and leaf phenology depend on plant traits that are measured in the field for many individuals and species. The model is thus capable of jointly simulating forest structure, diversity, and ecosystem functioning, a major challenge in modelling vegetation dynamics. 
 TROLL 4.0 is an individual-based forest dynamics model that is capable of jointly simulating forest structure, diversity, and ecosystem functioning, including the ecosystem water balance and productivity, leaf area dynamics, and the tree community functional and taxonomic composition. It represents ecosystem flux processes in a manner similar to dynamic global vegetation models, while adopting a representation of plant community structure and diversity at a resolution consistent with that used by field ecologists. Specifically, trees are modelled as three-dimensional individuals with a metric-scale spatial representation, providing a detailed description of ecological processes such as competition for resources and tree demography. Carbon assimilation and plant water loss are explicitly represented at tree level using coupled photosynthesis and stomatal conductance models, depending on the micro-environmental conditions experienced by trees. Soil water uptake by trees is also modelled. Physiological and demographic processes are parameterized using plant functional traits measured in the field. Here we provide a detailed description and discussion of the implementation of TROLL 4.0. An evaluation of the model at two tropical forest sites is provided in a companion paper (Schmitt et al., 2025). TROLL 4.0's representation of processes reflects the state of the art, and we discuss possible developments to improve its predictive capability and its capacity to address challenges in forest monitoring, forest dynamics, and carbon cycle research."

Using two nationwide data sets, we provide a profile of PFAS contamination in the United States and compare site categories with groundwater PFAS detections to identify site characteristics and sources of concern. We use data from the PFAS Project Lab’s Known PFAS Contamination Tracker (N = 2219) and presumptive PFAS contamination data set (N = 79,891), developed to characterize the distribution of known and likely PFAS sources. In this data set, all categories of known PFAS contamination sites are associated with average groundwater PFAS concentrations above health-based regulatory levels (4 ppt); 94% of detections exceed this limit. Aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) use was associated with the highest average PFAS detections in this data set, and metal plating facilities account for the greatest proportion of industrial contamination sites that likely utilize PFAS (53%), though we also identified testing gaps of non-AFFF contamination sources. We conducted spatial cluster analyses, identifying hotspots of PFAS sites at national and regional levels. These findings can support multiscale approaches to PFAS remediation, including testing, siting, permitting, and community outreach, though cautious interpretation is necessary because of data set limitations. This analysis demonstrates the utility of a presumptive contamination model."

Despite global regulatory efforts to promote water-based alternatives, ECs still account for 25% of the market, primarily due to formulation challenges associated with low-melting-point active ingredients. Here, we present a scalable crystal engineering strategy to address this bottleneck. A cocrystal of the low-melting-point fungicide difenoconazole (DZ) and thiophanate-methyl (TM) was synthesized via liquid-assisted grinding, achieving a melting point of 131 °C, 71 °C higher than that of the DZ and TM mixture. The elevated melting point ensures the thermal stability of the suspension, preventing paste-like caking during storage and enabling the formulation of stable water-based suspension concentrates (SCs) with significantly improved fluidity. The viscosity of the cocrystal SCs (105 mPa·s) was 53-fold lower than that of the physical mixture SCs (5600 mPa·s). The cocrystal also exhibits enhanced bioactivity and a 6-fold increase in foliar adhesion, improving pesticide efficiency and reducing environmental runoff. To support industrial implementation, the process was successfully scaled up to the kilogram level using simple batch crystallization under ambient conditions. As regulatory frameworks continue to tighten, this approach offers a practical and industrially feasible path to replace solvent-based formulations. If widely adopted, it could mitigate an estimated hundreds, or even thousands, of kilotons of VOC emissions annually, marking a significant step toward a sustainable agriculture system."

A combined life cycle assessment, techno-economic analysis, geospatial modeling, and evolutionary optimization framework was applied to evaluate the county-level deployment of nine feedstocks across seven land classifications. The findings underscore critical trade-offs between land use, fuel production costs, and emissions reductions in achieving national SAF targets. In cost-optimized scenarios, sorghum and miscanthus comprise most of the production (together >95%), achieving minimum fuel selling prices as low as $3.24 gallon–1. Cultivation land-minimizing scenarios favor algae exclusively, reducing land use to 0.5% of the contiguous U.S., but with higher fuel prices and emissions. Emissions-optimized scenarios are largely composed of miscanthus (>99%), achieving life-cycle emissions below 5 gCO2-eq MJ–1. The breakeven carbon price optimized scenarios deploy a mix of miscanthus (86%), sorghum (13%), and soy (1%); balancing low fuel cost and emissions with a breakeven carbon price of $161 tCO2-eq–1. Across all cases, feedstock yields, biomass-to-fuel conversion efficiencies, and spatial heterogeneity strongly influence feasibility. These results highlight the importance of coordinated optimization strategies to enable cost-effective, low-carbon SAF production and support efforts to inform energy policy, supply chain planning, and commercialization pathways."

Abrupt, large-scale reductions in human activities provided a natural experiment to quantify anthropogenic impact on aerosol-cloud-climate interactions in coastal India. Combining chemical and microphysical measurements under drastically reduced and subsequently reintroduced emission scenarios, we reveal that CCN concentrations increased by 80–250% postlockdown. This surge coincided with increased new particle formation (NPF) event frequency and enhanced particle growth rates. Postlockdown air masses shifted from marine to continental sources, revealing that anthropogenic organic matter (OM), despite lower hygroscopicity, dominated particle growth to CCN-active sizes, offsetting hygroscopicity limitations.

Guidance and insights into the projection of future water conditions are, therefore, increasingly needed to inform climate change adaptation. Hydrological projections can provide such insights when suitably designed for user needs, produced from the best available climate knowledge, and leverage appropriate hydrological models. However, producing such hydrological projections is a complex process that requires skills and knowledge spanning from the often‐siloed disciplines of climate, hydrology, communication, and decision‐making. Groundwater projections are still underrepresented compared to surface water projections, despite the importance of groundwater to sustain society and the environment. Accordingly, this paper bridges these silos and fills a gap by providing detailed guidance on the important steps and best practices to develop groundwater‐inclusive hydrological projections that can effectively support decision‐making. Using an extensive literature review and our practical experience as climate scientists, hydro(geo)logists, numerical modelers, uncertainty experts and decision‐makers, here we provide: (a) an overview of climate change hydrological impacts as background knowledge; (b) a step‐by‐step guide to produce groundwater‐inclusive hydrological projections under climate change, targeted to both scientists and water practitioners; (c) a summary of important considerations related to hydrological projection uncertainty; and (d) insights to use hydrological projections and their associated uncertainty for impactful communication and decision‐making.

 The Southern Ocean plays a crucial role in the global carbon budget. One key interval for understanding this role is the Antarctic Cold Reversal (14,700–12,700 calibrated (cal) yr bp)—a Southern Hemisphere-specific cooling event that temporarily reversed the deglacial trend of warming and rising atmospheric CO2. Modelling studies propose that the atmospheric CO2 plateau during the Antarctic Cold Reversal is related to increased marine productivity. However, proxy constraints on the primary producer community are limited to the subset of groups that leave a fossil record. Here we applied ancient DNA shotgun metagenomics to samples from a marine sediment core to characterize the composition of the marine ecosystem across all trophic levels, finding that the haptophyte algae Phaeocystis antarctica was the dominant primary producer during the event. Independent proxy evidence from the same record points to high productivity in response to enhanced sea-ice seasonality caused by the cooling. Post Antarctic Cold Reversal, abrupt Phaeocystis community loss shows how sensitive this ecosystem is to warming, potentially representing a key tipping element. As an analogy for present warming, it highlights the importance of regions with high seasonal sea-ice variability and Phaeocystis dominance, such as the Ross Sea, in stabilizing atmospheric CO2 content.

 Surface deformation observed in subduction zone forearcs helps to determine the locking state of the megathrust beneath, and therefore seismic and tsunami hazards. The vertical component of such deformation is particularly important, but measurements of this component in various subduction zones show a level of complexity that is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate from numerical simulations and a global compilation of observations that this apparent complexity can be readily explained in terms of earthquake cycles in a viscoelastic Earth. We show that subduction zones follow a common process of earthquake cycle evolution but are currently at various stages of this cycle, and that, during interseismic deformation, there is a previously overlooked secondary zone of subsidence around the volcanic arc, in addition to the primary zone of subsidence near the trench. We propose that this secondary zone is a key signature of megathrust locking that is absent from the elastic models commonly used to infer the locking state. The importance of this signature is demonstrated by the Lesser Antilles subduction zone, where we argue that the ongoing subsidence of the island arc is strong evidence for the presence of such a secondary zone; this implies that the megathrust is locked and building energy for a future earthquake, contrary to the prevailing understanding. A secondary zone of subsidence near the volcanic arc in subduction zones is indicative of the locking state of the megathrust, which for the Lesser Antilles megathrust suggests that it is locked, according to numerical simulations and deformation data."

 Cherenkov radiation has attracted much attention for promoting the free electron radiation sources. Using hyperbolic metamaterial, Cherenkov radiation can be excited using low-energy electrons and thus on-chip free electron radiation source has been realized. However, direct experimental observations of on-chip free-electron-based Cherenkov radiation have been limited to the visible region, and the tunability has not been thoroughly explored. In this work, by constructing a hyperbolic metamaterial with graphene and hexagonal boron nitride, on-chip, free-electron-based terahertz Cherenkov radiation is observed and the frequency tunable range spans 3.2 to 14 THz in a hundred-micron-scale dimension. Compared with other free-electron terahertz sources, the chip size is over three orders of magnitude smaller, and the tunable range is one of the widest. This work extends the on-chip free-electron-based Cherenkov radiation into terahertz domain, highlighting its tunability and paves the way for further advancements in free electron radiation source.

 Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are epigenetic regulators frequently altered in cancer. Here we report that overexpression of HDAC1/2 occurs in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) patients, correlating with poor prognosis. We show that romidepsin, a class-I HDAC inhibitor, elicits a combinatorial perturbation of distinct molecular processes in HCC cells, altering lipid composition, mitotic spindle machinery, and levels of cell cycle/survival signals. Collectively, these alterations lead HCC cells to a vulnerable state, conferring dependency to receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signalling support. The cytostatic effects of romidepsin alone is converted into cytotoxicity by the RTK inhibitor cabozantinib in HCC models. We document that romidepsin+cabozantibib confers an immune-stimulatory profile in Alb-R26Met mouse models, with direct effects on primary human dendritic cell maturation in vitro. Our findings put forward the intricate crosstalk between epigenetics, metabolism, and immune response in cancer.

 Hydroazidation of alkenes provides a direct entry to alkyl azides, which are prevalent structural motifs in medicine development and chemical biology probes. While direct access to anti-Markovnikov hydroazidation products has seen recent progress, these protocols are restricted to highly oxidative hypervalent iodine reagents or superstoichiometric metal salts under photochemical conditions with moderate olefin generality. Thus, the development of a mild, catalytic, redox-neutral hydroazidation with high anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity compatible with diverse classes of alkene remains challenging. Here we report a photocatalytic anti-Markovnikov hydroazidation of alkenes enabled by cooperative ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). Critical to this protocol is the use of ligand to achieve efficient visible-light induced homolysis of iron azide species and the cooperation with thiol catalysts to promote this redox-neutral process and address previous challenging substrates. Additionally, the photocatalytic system enables a regioselective haloazidation via a tandem LMCT/ halogen atom transfer (XAT) process with judicious choice of halogenating reagents. Preliminary mechanistic studies support a radical nature of this cooperative system and suggest it to be a powerful manifold in olefin hydro- and di-functionalization.

 In brain development, neural stem cells (NSCs) undergo asymmetric cell divisions to replicate themselves and meanwhile produce differentiating siblings. It remains obscure how NSCs preserve their self-renewing fate across mitosis. Even less is known how cell fate memory is differentially propagated to sibling daughter cells adopting distinct cell fates. Here we found that key differentiation genes are dually bookmarked by pioneer factor GAF (GAGA factor) and H3K27ac in asymmetrically-dividing Drosophila central brain NSCs. In daughter cells adopting NSC fate, GAF promotes self-renewal through timely inhibiting differentiation genes via HDAC1-mediated H3K27 deacetylation, whereas in sibling daughter cells adopting neural progenitor fate, GAF occupancy is replaced by competitor SWI/SNF complex, allowing retention of H3K27ac mark and fast activation of differentiation genes.

Here they describe a system in which synchronized human nephron structures are generated from pluripotent stem cells, enabling manipulation of axial segmentation. 
 The human nephron is a highly patterned tubular structure that develops specialized cells to regulate bodily fluid homeostasis, blood pressure, and urine secretion throughout life. Approximately 1 million nephrons form in each kidney during embryonic and fetal development, but how they develop is poorly understood. Here, we interrogate axial patterning mechanisms in the human nephron using an iPSC-derived kidney organoid system that generates hundreds of developmentally synchronized nephrons, and we compare it to in vivo human kidney development using single cell and spatial transcriptomic approaches. We show that human nephron patterning is controlled by integrated WNT/BMP/FGF signaling. Imposing a WNTON/BMPOFF state established a distal nephron identity that matures into thick ascending loop of Henle cells by endogenously activating FGF. Simultaneous suppression of FGF signaling switches cells back to a proximal cell-state, a transformation that is in itself dependent on BMP signal transduction. Our system highlights plasticity in axial nephron patterning, delineates the roles of WNT, FGF, and BMP mediated mechanisms controlling nephron patterning, and paves the way for generating nephron cells on demand.

 The extensive dendrite formation and unstable interfacial chemical environment pose significant obstacles to operating lithium metal batteries under extreme conditions. Here, we develop an allyl ether electrolyte operated across a wide-temperature range. Leveraging the neighboring group participation effect of alkenyl groups, the designed electrolyte possesses a quasi-weak solvation structure with low desolvation energy. Moreover, this effect facilitates the anion decomposition to form a dual-layer solid electrolyte interface, suppressing dendrite formation and surface parasitic reactions. Therefore, the single-salt, single-solvent electrolyte enables reversible lithium plating/stripping with high Coulombic efficiencies from −40 °C to 60 °C. The assembled 50 μm lithium | |3.5 mAh cm−2 sulfurized polyacrylonitrile full cells achieve capacity retention of 93.1% after 150 stable cycles (0.2 C) at 25 °C, where the positive electrode could retain 78% of its room temperature capacity at −40 °C.

 Climate change and population ageing are both urgent global challenges. Yet the interaction between these, such as associations between long-term exposure to heatwaves and biological age acceleration (BAA), is unclear. Here we analysed data from 24,922 adults in a longitudinal cohort in Taiwan (2008–2022) and used linear mixed models to show heatwaves accelerate ageing. Heatwaves were defined using both relative and absolute thresholds. BAA was calculated as the difference between biological and chronological age. Each interquartile range increase in the cumulative exposure to heatwaves was associated with a 0.023- to 0.031-year increase in BAA. Moreover, the participants demonstrated gradual adaptation to heatwave impacts over the 15-year period. Furthermore, manual workers, rural residents and participants from communities with fewer air conditioners were more susceptible to the health impacts. This study highlights the need for targeted policies and interventions to strengthen adaptive capacity, delay ageing and promote healthy ageing. Ageing is linked to environmental factors.

Here the authors present a data-mechanism-fused machine learning approach to assist the development of such membranes. 
 Developing polymeric membranes that effectively remove organic micropollutants (OMPs) is important for water management. However, the structural diversity and physiochemical variability of OMPs make it challenging to develop such membranes. Here we present a data-mechanism-integrated approach to assist membrane design. This approach integrates molecular fingerprint and physical models within the machine learning framework to quantify how functional groups in OMPs affect removal by polymeric membranes and to elucidate the removal mechanisms. We uncovered an anomalous multigroup coupling effect in membrane-based OMP removal and showed that the efficiency of removal depends on the influence of the functional group coupling in the molecular structure. This finding challenges the conventional approach in membrane screening and design that focuses on the properties of isolated functional groups. By combining this knowledge with assessments of OMP types and membrane properties, we reveal a comprehensive interaction framework for tailoring OMP-removal membranes. Overall, the data-mechanism co-driven paradigm has the potential to facilitate the development of advanced water-treatment membranes, eventually contributing to sustainable water management and the preservation of a safe water environment.

 The re-emergence of swift and transient Equatorial Undercurrent in the Indian Ocean significantly redistributes mass and heat across the basin, exacerbating large uncertainties in regional climate projections. Although canonical positive Indian Ocean Dipole events typically phase-lock with autumnal re-emergence of Equatorial Undercurrent, here we report an unusual summer re-emergence in 2008 under the early Dipole event that developed and matured in summer. This anomalous re-emergence challenges conventional understanding of Dipole-undercurrent teleconnections, unveiling two critical mechanisms: First, enhanced summer wind-thermocline couplings during early Dipole events intensify equatorial wave activity, driving the undercurrent’s summer re-emergence, with preceding La Niña conditions further amplifying this effect through slow-propagating boundary-reflected waves. Second, future projections using coupled climate models indicate that such summer re-emergence events may become more frequent under global warming due to shifts in anomalous Walker Cells. These findings enrich our understanding of global undercurrent diversity and facilitate subsequent research on tropical circulation-ecological effects.

 As commodities enter supply chains, consumers rely on distant freshwater sources to ensure continued supply. This information often lacks the traceability and granularity required to assess the reliance of supply chains on specific river basins and their level of water scarcity. Here, we quantify the volume and source of freshwater for the production and export of Brazilian soy and beef to China and the EU, together with deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions for the 2015–2017 period. Both sectors mainly rely on rainfed systems, but also soy irrigation and a combination of cattle drinking and evaporation from reservoirs serving as the drinking source.

 For the challenges with nearshore small ship detection in remote sensing images (RSIs) under complex background, a lightweight network called “multi-path attention and shifted large kernel network for ship detection” (briefly called “MSS-Net”) in RSIs is proposed. Firstly, shifted large kernel with feature enhancement module (SLKE) is developed to enlarge receptive field by decomposing large kernels and shift operation while performing dynamic channel attention. Secondly, multi-path attention (MPA) is designed to effectively retain the co-calibration of spatial-channel information of ships. Thirdly, shared convolutional detection head (SCDH) is built to unify multi-scale features, reducing parameter redundancy. The proposed MSS-Net is validated through three public datasets, TGRS-HRRSD, MASATI and LEVIR. Using YOLOv8 as a baseline model for comparison analysis. The results demonstrate that the mAP50 reaches 97.5%, 78.8%, and 93.2% with the three datasets, respectively. The mAP50 with the proposed MSS-Net is higher 2.9% than YOLOX, 4.4% than RetinaNet in popular one-stage ship detection models, and 4.8% than Faster R-CNN; 2.7% than Cascade R-CNN in two-stage ship detection models. Moreover, the parameters in the MSS-Net reduces 26.7% relative to the baseline model, achieving a lightweight design. Besides, ablation experiments are conducted with the TGRS-HRRSD dataset. The results demonstrates that the SLKE increases mAP50 by 1.1%, the MPA increases mAP50 by 1.7%, while the SCDH reduces parameters by 35%.

 Urbanization influences tropospheric circulation, particularly around large cities. While the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect on regional rainfall is well-documented, larger uncertainties still remain for urban aerosol’s effect on precipitation. This study employs the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) to examine aerosol-driven modifications to urban precipitation in Dallas–Fort Worth, TX, during both a deep convective and a stratiform event. We generate a WRF-Chem ensemble that explores multiple scenarios, including simulations with and without atmospheric chemistry, aerosols, land use perturbations, and altered background emissions, enabling the isolation of key physical and chemical drivers of rainfall variability. From this analysis it emerges that urban and background aerosols exert a significant influence on precipitation affecting cloud life-cycle and storm dynamics through changes in cloud condensation nuclei concentrations, cloud water paths, latent heat fluxes, and vertical velocities. During the analyzed deep convective event, numerous ultrafine anthropogenic aerosols activated in the lower atmosphere, forming a transient neutral layer beneath an intrusion of dry air. This process initially suppressed convection; however, as the system evolved, convection progressively intensified through enhanced mixed-phase processes, resulting in a significant increase in urban precipitation. The absence of this aerosol-driven mechanism in the simulation without chemistry led to an underestimation of urban rainfall intensity. In contrast, no significant changes are found for the stratiform event due to land-use perturbation and aerosols. These findings highlight the importance of aerosol-cloud interactions in urban meteorology and provide insights for potentially improving weather forecasting in densely populated regions."
