This article presents the first bibliometric analysis and systematic review of the literature on the environmental impacts of the cocaine value chain in Latin America, aiming to uncover its specific effects across four stages: (i) coca cultivation, (ii) coca farming, (iii) cocaine manufacturing and (iv) cocaine trafficking. Using a four-step selection process, we reviewed 121 studies published between 1979 and 2022, retrieved from 10 search engines and scientific databases, complemented by an extensive screening of gray literature. The article identifies and quantifies most frequent study sites, research methods, data sources and metrics, followed by a critical review of the research findings. Key findings highlight that land use land cover change and deforestation in the coca cultivation and cocaine trafficking phases, along with soil degradation under the coca farming stage, are the main variables examined to evaluate impacts. Nevertheless, substantial gaps remain in our understanding of how these impacts are distributed across study areas, their applicability to the broader region, and the consistency and rigor of the research methodologies used. The article concludes by incorporating research and policy recommendations that underscore how these environmental impacts are deeply intertwined with the failures of the drug war, emphasizing the need to develop more comprehensive and evidence-based policy responses."

This study aimed to improve understanding of global land cover dynamics to enable more effective future land management practices and conservation actions. This study quantified interannual changes in global land cover types from 2001 to 2020 and distinguished intermittent transitions from stable gains and losses. From the interannual perspective, we found that global barren lands, forests, shrublands, and snow-covered areas decreased by 5281, 1804, 952, and 188 kha yr−1, respectively. In contrast, grasslands, croplands, urban areas, and water bodies increased at 6529, 1407, 237, and 51 kha yr−1, respectively, from 2001 to 2020. According to the definitions provided in this paper, of the global forest areas, 75% was Stable (no change), 4% was Gain, 5% was Loss, and 16% was Unstable. Of the cropland areas, 56% was Stable, 9% was Gain, 9% was Loss, and 26% was Unstable. Hotspots for forest loss were Brazil, the Rest of South America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, and grassland was the most common land cover classification following forest loss. The global cropland expansion hotspots were Brazil, Canada, China, India, and the Rest of South America. The cropland gains were mainly converted from grasslands. On the other hand, barren areas in China and Middle Eastern and North Africa were changed to grasslands. A certain amount of shrublands were changed to forest in temperate regions. This paper provided land cover changes at a 500 m spatial resolution as a benchmark for future assessments. The findings showed that unstable pixels play an important role in determining the sources of uncertainty when assessing land cover changes using satellite data. Land cover assessments are sensitive to the time steps used for analysis and the definition of changes."

In 2023–2024, coastal terrestrial ecosystems in Western Australia were particularly affected, experiencing their driest and hottest summer since observations began in the early 1900s. Banksia woodlands are a threatened ecological community in this region that are endangered by the cumulative impacts of climate change, clearing and changing groundwater regimes, the last of which is strongly influenced by the dual use of groundwater resources by the ecosystem and by the ∼2 million people in the city of Perth. Within the banksia woodlands is a Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) long-term ecological observatory that has been measuring ecosystem phenology, groundwater levels and carbon, water and energy fluxes since 2011. The 11-year site records confirm 2023 rainfall was the lowest in the record. Groundwater monitoring showed an ∼1 m drop in 2023–2024 alone, in addition to a long-term reduction of ∼4 m in water table depth since observations began in 1977. The resulting extreme water deficits manifested in reduced ecosystem evapotranspiration and altered carbon flux dynamics. Phenocam imagery revealed the consequences of this water deficit at the site level through visible canopy dieback and shifts in vegetation greenness indices. Vegetation indices from remote sensing products showed widespread vegetation stress across the ecosystem range. Continued monitoring at local and regional scales with these combined methodologies will determine (a) how well the Banksia ecosystems are able to recover from this extreme climate event and (b) the ramifications for the carbon and water cycle of the region. This ecosystem is a sentinel of climate change, providing early insight into how ecosystem-climate interactions are altering globally."

Assessing the performance and environmental impacts of copper mining is therefore necessary to evaluate the progress towards sustainable development. In this study, we estimate the nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions (largely attributable to the diesel-powered mobile fleet) over 14 of the world’s largest open-pit copper mines. We derive the emissions by applying a data-driven approach to the satellite-based nitrogen dioxide (NO2) observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument on board the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite. We find that the annual NOx emissions over the different mines are coupled to the corresponding copper production, ore processed and total material moved. The time series analysis reveals that the annual amount of total material moved over the open pit of each mine best reproduces the year-to-year variability of the NOx emissions. Overall, satellite NO2 observations show good potential in tracking mining activities and for improving the assessment of the environmental impact of the mining industry."

A systematic review from South Asia,"Trees have emerged as a key focus of global environmental policy. Several programs promote planting of trees outside forests (ToF), in places such as farms and grazing lands, due to the potential of trees to provide a wide variety of benefits to people and nature. Yet, our knowledge of human well-being outcomes of ToFs is limited, especially in South Asia. In this systematic literature review, we examine multidimensional human wellbeing outcomes of a wide range of ToF practices in rural landscapes of South Asian countries; including Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Relying on six databases, we uncover a large body of research in 325 articles considered for this review. Articles from Bangladesh and India dominate our review, with 71% of the studies. Further, two ToF systems, tree and forest gardens and multipurpose trees on farms, were the most commonly studied, accounting for approximately 43% of the dataset. About 62% of publications reported increases in incomes, representing economic wellbeing, 34% and 36% of publications reported an increase in material wellbeing (access to biomass and fuelwood respectively), and 10% in dietary diversity. ToF systems also created opportunities for vocational training. Trade-offs include negative and mixed outcomes on people’s sense of agency, political voice, and social equity in particular with afforestation and monoculture plantation projects in which governmental agencies took leadership or influential roles. Some research designs were weak and it was unclear whether the studied tree-based systems reflect the actual distribution of tree-based systems in South Asia. This review offers useful insights to guide ongoing and future tree-based natural-climate solutions projects in the region and worldwide to ensure ecological security and human wellbeing are well considered. It also points to areas where future research is needed."

This area faces pressures from climate change, land use and cover change (LULC), and infrastructure. Therefore, this study evaluates the effectiveness of current environmental policies on native vegetation conservation, water availability, and fire dynamics in the UPRB under current legislation in the state of Mato Grosso (MT). We used LULC data from 1985–2022 to estimate changes in water, native vegetation, exotic grasslands, and areas that could be converted to exotic grasslands for cattle ranching under state Decree N°.774/2024. We analyzed water coverage trends, including riparian preservation areas (RPAs) protected by federal law N°.12651/2012. Evapotranspiration comparisons were made between regions with and without artificial drainage. We also investigated trends in burned areas and the effectiveness of fire ban decrees. Our results indicate a significant increase in exotic grasslands across the entire UPRB portion of MT. We also found a significant decrease in water cover in the Pantanal, accompanied by an increase in native grass cover. Exotic grasslands can cover an area similar to native vegetation due to the new decree (774/2024), which includes 21 000 km2 of legal reserves (sustainable use areas) now available for grazing. The Pantanal has lost more than 8000 km2 of water over the past 37 yrs, with similar decreasing trend in water cover found within RPAs. Areas with artificial drainage showed lower evapotranspiration. Fire ban decrees were ineffective in reducing burned areas to expected levels. Current policies are insufficient to protect the interconnected ecosystems across the UPRB. Immediate measures, including adaptive management, strengthened legislation, and sustainable land and fire management practices, are essential to mitigate environmental impacts in the UPRB and safeguard its ecological and economic integrity."

Our results demonstrate that the 11-year solar signals in the shortwave heating rate, temperature, and ozone anomalies are significant and robust. The simulated dynamical responses are model-dependent, and solar imprints in the polar night jet are influenced by biases in the model used. 
 To better understand possible reasons for the diverse modeling results and large discrepancies of the detected solar fingerprints, we took one step back and assessed the “initial” solar signals in the middle atmosphere based on a set of ensemble historical simulations with multiple climate models – the Flexible Ocean Climate Infrastructure (FOCI), the ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC), and the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth System Model in high-resolution configuration (MPI-ESM-HR). Consistent with previous work, we find that the 11-year solar cycle signals in the shortwave heating rate (SWHR) and ozone anomalies are robust and statistically significant in all three models. These initial solar cycle signals in the SWHR, ozone, and temperature anomalies are sensitive to the strength of the solar forcing. Correlation coefficients of the solar cycle with the SWHR, ozone, and temperature anomalies linearly increase along with the enhancement of the solar cycle amplitude. This reliance becomes more complex when the solar cycle amplitude –  indicated by the standard deviation of the December–January–February mean F10.7 – is larger than 40. In addition, the cold bias in the tropical stratopause of EMAC dampens the subsequent results of the initial solar signal. The warm pole bias in MPI-ESM-HR leads to a weak polar night jet (PNJ), which may limit the top-down propagation of the initial solar signal. Although FOCI simulated a so-called top-down response as revealed in previous studies in a period with large solar cycle amplitudes, its warm bias in the tropical upper stratosphere results in a positive bias in PNJ and can lead to a “reversed” response in some extreme cases. We suggest a careful interpretation of the single model result and further re-examination of the solar signal based on more climate models."

The findings highlight BrC's climate impact and emphasize source-specific constraints in atmospheric models. 
 Brown carbon (BrC) is a fraction of organic aerosol (OA) that absorbs radiation in the ultraviolet and short visible wavelengths. Its contribution to radiative forcing is uncertain due to limited knowledge of its imaginary refractive index (k). This study investigates the variability of k for OA from wildfires, residential, shipping, and traffic emission sources over Europe. The Multiscale Online Nonhydrostatic Atmosphere Chemistry  (MONARCH) model simulated OA concentrations and source contributions, feeding an offline optical tool to constrain k values at 370 nm. The model was evaluated against OA mass concentrations from aerosol chemical speciation monitors (ACSMs) and filter sample measurements, as well as aerosol light absorption measurements at 370 nm derived from an Aethalometer™ from 12 sites across Europe. Results show that MONARCH captures the OA temporal variability across environments (regional, suburban, and urban background). Residential emissions are a major OA source in colder months, while secondary organic aerosol (SOA) dominates in warmer periods. Traffic is a minor primary OA contributor. Biomass and coal combustion significantly influence OA absorption, with shipping emissions also notable near harbors. Optimizing k values at 370 nm revealed significant variability in OA light absorption, influenced by emission sources and environmental conditions. Derived k values for biomass burning (0.03 to 0.13), residential (0.008 to 0.13), shipping (0.005 to 0.08), and traffic (0.005 to 0.07) sources improved model representation of OA absorption compared to a constant k. Introducing such emission source-specific constraints is an innovative approach to enhance OA absorption in atmospheric models."

Our research examines how weather patterns affect tiny particles called cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), which influence cloud properties. Using data from Kennaook / Cape Grim, we found that winter air from Antarctica brings cleaner conditions with lower CCN, while summer patterns from Australia transport more particles. Precipitation also helps reduce CCN in winter. 
 Cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) play a fundamental role in determining the microphysical properties of low-level clouds that are crucial for defining the energy budget over the Southern Ocean (SO). However, many aspects of the CCN budget over the SO remains poorly understood, including the role of the synoptic meteorology. In this study, we classify six distinct synoptic regimes over the Kennaook / Cape Grim Observatory (CGO) and examine their influence on the seasonal cycle of the CCN concentration (NCCN). Three “winter” regimes are dominant when the subtropical ridge (STR) is strong and centered at lower latitudes, while three “summer” regimes prevail when the STR shifts to higher latitudes. Distinct winter and summer “baseline” synoptic patterns contribute to the seasonal cycle of NCCN, with the winter baseline regime characterized by heavier precipitation (0.10 vs. 0.03 mm h−1), a deeper boundary layer (850 vs. 900 hPa), and lower NCCN (71 vs. 137 cm−3) than the summer one. Across these two baseline regimes, we observe a significant inverse relationship between precipitation and NCCN, underscoring the contribution of precipitation in reducing NCCN over the SO. An analysis of air mass back-trajectories, specifically at the free-troposphere level, supports this seasonal distinction, with wintertime air masses originating more frequently from higher latitudes. The summertime STR is seen as a barrier to Antarctic air masses reaching the latitude of the CGO. Conversely, the summer baseline regime is found to pass more frequently over continental Australia before reaching the CGO, consistent with enhanced radon concentrations."

 Black carbon (BC) exerts significant impacts on both climate and environment. The BC aging process alters its hygroscopicity and light absorption properties. Current models, like the Weather Research and Forecasting – Community Multiscale Air Quality (WRF-CMAQ) two-way coupled model, inadequately characterize these alterations. In this study, we accounted for the BC aging process in the WRF-CMAQ model (WRF-CMAQ-BCG). We introduced two new species (bare BC and coated BC) into the model and implemented a module to simulate the conversion from bare BC to coated BC, thereby characterizing the aging process. Furthermore, we improved the wet-deposition and aerosol optical modules to analyze the effects of BC aging on hydrophobicity and light absorption. The simulated results indicate a spatial distribution pattern with bare BC prevalent near emission sources and coated BC more common farther from sources. The average number fraction of coated BC (NFcoated) is approximately 57 %. Temporal variation exhibits a distinct diurnal pattern, with NFcoated increasing during the daytime. The spatial distribution of wet deposition varies significantly between bare and coated BC. Bare BC exhibits a point-like deposition pattern, whereas coated BC displays a zonal distribution. Notably, coated BC dominates the BC wet-deposition process. Additionally, incorporating the BC aging process reduces BC wet deposition by 17.7 % and increases BC column concentration by 10.5 %. The simulated mass absorption cross-section (MAC) value improved agreement with observed measurements. Overall, the WRF-CMAQ-BCG model enhances the capability to analyze aging-related variables and the BC mixing state while also improving performance in terms of wet deposition and optical properties."

Film thicknesses were approximately 10 Å and 17 Å for urban and remote extracts, respectively. Exposure to gas-phase OH radicals showed fast reactions and short lifetimes of around 1 h. The effect on the Earth's radiative balance indicated that removing half of the film could significantly increase the top-of-atmosphere albedo for urban films. 
 Water-insoluble organic material extracted from atmospheric aerosol samples collected in urban (Royal Holloway, University of London, UK) and remote (Halley Research Station, Antarctica) locations were shown to form stable thin surfactant films at an air–water interface. These organic films reacted quickly with gas-phase OH radicals and may impact planetary albedo.  The X-ray reflectivity measurements additionally indicate that the film may be consistent with having a structure with increased electron density of film molecules towards the water, suggesting amphiphilic behaviour. Assuming the material extracted from atmospheric aerosol produces thin films on aqueous particles and cloud droplets, modelling the oxidation kinetics with a kinetic model of aerosol surface and bulk chemistry (KM-SUB) suggests half-lives of minutes to an hour and values of ksurf of ∼2×10-7 and ∼5×10-5 cm2 s−1 for urban and remote aerosol film extracts, respectively. The superfluous half-lives calculated at typical OH atmospheric ambient mixing ratios are smaller than the typical residence time of atmospheric aerosols; thus, oxidation of organic material should be considered in atmospheric modelling. Thin organic films at the air–water interface of atmospheric aerosol or cloud droplets may alter the light-scattering properties of the aerosol. X-ray reflectivity measurements of atmospheric aerosol film material at the air–water interface resulted in calculated film thickness values to be either ∼10  or ∼17 Å for remote or urban aerosol extracts, respectively, and oxidation did not remove the films completely.  One-dimensional radiative transfer modelling suggests the oxidation of thin organic films on atmospheric particles by OH radicals may reduce the planetary albedo by a small, but potentially significant, amount."

We evaluate the contributions of climatic, anthropogenic, and biogenic factors by season and region. We find persistent emission controls will alter the nonlinear response of ozone to its precursors and dominate the declining ozone level. The outcomes highlight the importance of human actions, even with a climate penalty on air quality. 
 Climate change and associated human response are supposed to greatly alter surface ozone (O3), an air pollutant generated through photochemical reactions involving both anthropogenic and biogenic precursors. However, a comprehensive evaluation of China's O3 response to these multiple changes has been lacking. We present a modeling framework under Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP2-4.5), incorporating future changes in local and foreign anthropogenic emissions, meteorological conditions, and biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions. From the 2020s to 2060s, daily maximum 8 h average (MDA8) O3 concentration is simulated to decline by 7.7 ppb in the warm season (April–September) and 1.1 ppb in the non-warm season (October–March) over the country, with a substantial reduction in exceedances of national O3 standards. Notably, O3 decreases are more pronounced in developed regions such as Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH), the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and the Pearl River Delta (PRD) during the warm season, with reductions of 9.7, 14.8, and 12.5 ppb, respectively. Conversely, in the non-warm season, the MDA8 O3 in BTH and YRD will increase by 5.5 and 3.3 ppb, partly attributed to reduced NOx emissions and thereby a weakened titration effect. O3 pollution will thus expand into the non-warm season in the future. Sensitivity analyses reveal that local emission change will predominantly influence future O3 distribution and magnitude, with contributions from other factors within ±25 %. Furthermore, the joint impact of multiple factors on O3 reduction will be larger than the sum of individual factors, due to changes in the O3 formation regime. This study highlights the necessity of region-specific emission control strategies to mitigate potential O3 increases during the non-warm season and under the climate penalty."

Ground-based T inversions and thermal winds were studied during the 10 months of the campaign. The comparison between the observations and the COSMO-1E model provides good model performance for monthly climatologies. T inversions are however frequently missed, and important differences for particular cases are found, especially for foehn events. 
 Thermally driven valley winds and near-surface air temperature inversions are common in complex topography and have a significant impact on the local and mesoscale weather situation. They affect both the dynamics of air masses and the concentration of pollutants. Valley winds affect them by favoring horizontal transport and exchange between the boundary layer and the free troposphere, whereas temperature inversion concentrates pollutants in cold stable surface layers. The complex interactions that lead to the observed weather patterns are challenging for numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. To study the performance of the COSMO-1E (Consortium for Small-scale Modeling) analysis, which is called KENDA-1 (Km-Scale Ensemble-Based Data Assimilation), a measurement campaign took place from October 2021 to August 2022 in the 1.5 km wide Swiss Alpine valley of the Haslital. A microwave radiometer and a Doppler wind lidar were installed at Meiringen, in addition to numerous automatic ground measurement stations recording meteorological surface variables. Near the measurement site, the low-altitude Brünig Pass influences the wind dynamics similarly to a tributary. The data collected show frequent nighttime temperature inversions for all the months under study, which persist during the day in the colder months. An extended thermal wind system was also observed during the campaign, except in December and January, allowing for an extended analysis of the winds along and across the valley. The comparison between the observations and the KENDA-1 data provides good model performance for monthly temperature and wind medians but frequent and important differences for single profiles, especially in the case of particular events such as foehn events. Modeled nighttime ground temperature overestimation is common due to missed temperature inversions, resulting in a bias of up to 8 °C. Concerning the valley wind system, modeled flows are similar to the observations in their extent and strength but suffer from too early a morning transition time towards up-valley winds. The findings of the present study mostly based on monthly averages allow for a better understanding of the temperature distributions, the thermally driven wind system in a medium-sized valley, the interactions with tributary valley flows, and the performance and limitations of KENDA-1 in such a complex topography."

Our study examines the optimal sampling time for the TSI Nanometer Aerosol Sampler 3089 at different input concentrations. Aerosols from low-, medium-, and high-concentration environments were sampled over 1, 3, and 6 h. A linear relationship was observed using a regression model between the deposition densities and the product of input concentration and sampling time. 
 Physicochemical characterisation of airborne particles requires appropriate sampling and deposition methods. The TSI Nanometer Aerosol Sampler 3089 (TSI NAS) has predominantly been used as an electrostatic precipitator for depositing airborne particles, enabling subsequent offline characterisation through techniques such as electron microscopy. However, the optimal sampling time of TSI NAS for varying input concentrations has not been thoroughly investigated. This is extremely important as the concentrations of particles in different environments differ significantly. This study aimed to establish the appropriate sampling durations of TSI NAS for various input concentrations or, conversely, to determine suitable input concentrations for a fixed sampling duration. We developed an experimental setup and a linear regression model to predict conditions conducive to efficiently collecting loaded samples, particularly at low concentrations, such as exhaled particles from the human respiratory tract or marine aerosol particles. Experiments were conducted using the TSI NAS 3089 at a flow rate of 1 L min−1 and a voltage of −9 kV. Three particle types, nebulised from different solutions at low, medium, and high concentrations, were sampled over durations of 1, 3, and 6 h. Deposition densities were subsequently analysed using ImageJ software. The findings revealed a linear relationship between deposition density and the product of particle concentration and sampling time, with a recommended density range of 0.015 to 0.1 particles µm−2 for particles with a count median diameter of approximately 100 nm and average circularity of 0.56 ± 0.25. Despite potential factors affecting the accuracy of the model, such as the number of samples, random collisions, and potential overload in high-concentration experiments, it provides a valuable predictive tool for determining optimal sampling times. The suggested linear regression model is applicable across various research areas, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of airborne particle characterisation."

The study supports the use of remote sensing data to mapping long-time continuous annual vegetation. 
 The Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP), known as the Third Pole of the Earth and the “water tower of Asia”, plays a crucial role in global climate regulation, biodiversity conservation, and regional socio-economic development. Continuous annual vegetation types and their geographical distribution data are essential for studying the response and adaptation of vegetation to climate change. However, there are very limited data on vegetation types and their geographical distributions on the QTP due to the harsh natural environment. Currently, land cover and surface vegetation data are typically obtained using traditional classification methods for each period's product based on remote sensing information. These approaches do not consider the temporal continuity of vegetation presence, leading to a gradual increase in misclassified pixels and uncertainty in their locations, consequently decreasing the interpretability of the long-time-series remote sensing products. To address this issue, this study developed a new method for long-time continuous annual vegetation mapping based on reference vegetation maps and annual updates and mapped the vegetation of the QTP from 2000 to 2022 at a 500 m spatial resolution through the MOD09A1 product. The overall accuracy of continuous annual QTP vegetation mapping from 2000 to 2022 reached 83.27 %, with the reference annual 2020 data reaching an accuracy of 83.32 % and a kappa coefficient of 0.82. This study supports the use of remote sensing data for long-term continuous annual vegetation mapping.

Pure liquid water droplets are liquid until about -35 °C without the presence of a small subset of aerosols, ice-nucleating particles (INPs). These INPs lead to primary ice formation and therefore impact the phase of clouds. The dataset described herein provides INP concentration measurements at two altitudes. Connecting this data to synoptic conditions and ambient data might provide a better understanding of INPs in Finnish Lapland. 
 A novel filter-based sampler was deployed during the Pallas Cloud Experiment (PaCE) 2022 for a one-month period in September and October 2022 in Finnish Lapland around 5 km north of the Sammaltunturi station. This area frequently features low-level clouds during autumn. The sampler was deployed on-board of an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) and on the ground. Two filters were deployed simultaneously on the ground and on the UAV to enable a comparison between the two vertical levels. The dataset contains 14 INP spectra that feature a temporal overlap at both altitudes, a handling blank filter to assess possible contamination during handling and one additional sample from both setups without the temporal overlap. The dataset is the first of its kind, providing altitude-based INP concentrations in Finnish Lapland. There is no clear systematic difference between INP concentrations measured at the different altitudes. The INP concentration is variable over the period measured and also does show some differences on the vertical level. The connection to synoptic conditions and ambient measurements might provide a better understanding of the origin, lifetime, and distribution of INPs in Finnish Lapland."

Comparisons of mixing schemes and settings have usually been done with a single model, sometimes yielding conflicting results. We systematically compare two widely used schemes with different parameter settings in two different ocean models and show that most effects from mixing scheme parameter changes are model-dependent. 
 Ocean general circulation models still have large upper-ocean biases, including in tropical sea surface temperature, that are possibly connected to the representation of vertical mixing. In earlier studies, the ocean vertical mixing parameterization has usually been tuned for a specific site or only within a specific model. We present here a systematic comparison of the effects of changes in the vertical mixing scheme in two different global ocean models, ICON-O and FESOM, run at a horizontal resolution of 10 km in the tropical Atlantic. We test two commonly used vertical mixing schemes: the K-profile parameterization (KPP) and the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) scheme. Additionally, we vary tuning parameters in both schemes and test the addition of Langmuir turbulence in the TKE scheme. We show that the biases of mean sea surface temperature, subsurface temperature, subsurface currents, and mixed layer depth differ more between the two models than between runs with different mixing scheme settings within each model. For ICON-O, there is a larger difference between TKE and KPP than for FESOM. In both models, varying the tuning parameters hardly affects the pattern and magnitude of the mean state biases. For the representation of smaller-scale variability like the diurnal cycle or inertial waves, the choice of the mixing scheme can matter: the diurnally enhanced penetration of equatorial turbulence below the mixed layer is only simulated with TKE, not with KPP. However, tuning of the parameters within the mixing schemes does not lead to large improvements for these processes. We conclude that a substantial part of the upper-ocean tropical Atlantic biases is not sensitive to details of the vertical mixing scheme."

Do;Sabine Griessbach;Patrick Jöckel;Domenico Taraborrelli,The MESSy DWARF (based on MESSy v2.55.2),"Normally, the Modular Earth Submodel System (MESSy) is linked to complete dynamic models to create chemical climate models. However, the modular concept of MESSy and the newly developed DWARF component presented here make it possible to create simplified models that contain only one or a few process descriptions. This is very useful for technical optimisation, such as porting to GPUs, and can be used to create less complex models, such as a chemical box model. 
 The adaptation of Earth system model (ESM) codes to modern computing architectures is challenging as ESMs consist of a multitude of different components. Historically grown and developed by scientists rather than software engineers, the codes of the individual components are often interwoven, making the optimisation of the ESMs rather challenging, if not impossible. Thus, in the last few years, the codes have become increasingly modularised, and, with that, different components are now disentangled from each other. This helps porting the code section by section to modern computing architectures, e.g. to GPUs.For more than 20 years, the modularisation has been the fundamental concept of the Modular Earth Submodel System (MESSy). It is an integrated framework providing data structures and methods to build comprehensive ESMs from individual components. Each component, e.g. a cloud microphysical scheme, dry deposition of tracer gases, or diagnostic tools, as output along satellite orbits, is coded as an individual so-called submodel. Each submodel is connected via the MESSy infrastructure with all other components, together forming a comprehensive model system. MESSy was mainly developed for research in atmospheric chemistry, and, so far, it has always been connected  to a dynamical (climate or weather forecast) model, i.e. what we call a base model. The base model is a development outside the MESSy framework. Running a full dynamical model for technical tests when porting only one submodel is a tedious task and unnecessarily resource-consuming. Therefore, we developed the so-called MESSy DWARF, a simplified base model based on the MESSy infrastructure. We implemented the definition of a very simple grid, a parallelisation scheme, and a time control to replace a fully fledged base model.The MESSy DWARF serves as a valuable tool for technical applications, such as porting individual component implementations to GPUs and performance tests or as an easy test environment for process implementations. Due to the MESSy structure, the applied components can be  used in a dynamical model without any changes because the interface is exactly the same. Furthermore, the MESSy DWARF is suited for scientific purposes running simplified models (with only a selection of components), e.g. a chemical box model for the analysis of chamber experiments or a trajectory box model imitating an air parcel rising slowly into the stratosphere. Column and plume models could also easily be built based on the DWARF.In this article, we introduce the technical setup of the MESSy DWARF and show four example applications: (1) a simple application using a component calculating orbital parameters, (2) a chemical kinetics model including photolysis frequency calculation, (3) an application of a chemical box model, and (4) some details on a GPU performance test of the chemical kinetics model."

Through optimized processing procedures, NSOAS24 resolves previous issues and demonstrates improved accuracy. Compared to NSOAS22, NSOAS24 shows a reduction of approximately 0.7 mGal in standard deviation when validated against recent shipborne data. Notably, its accuracy now rivals internationally recognized models DTU21 and V32.1. 
 Judging by the early release of the NSOAS22 model, there were some known issues, such as boundary connection problems in blockwise solutions and a relatively high noise level. By solving these problems, a new global marine gravity model, NSOAS24, is derived based on sea surface slopes (SSSs) from multi-satellite altimetry missions. Firstly, SSSs and along-track deflections of vertical (DOVs) are obtained by retracking, resampling, screening, differentiating, and filtering procedures on the basis of altimeter waveforms and sea surface height measurements. Secondly, DOVs with a 1′×1′ grid interval are further determined using Green's function method, which applies directional gradients to constrain the surface, least-squares fit to constrain noisy points, and tension constraints to smooth the field. Finally, the marine gravity anomaly is recovered from the gridded DOVs according to the Laplace equation. Throughout the entire processing procedure, improvements in accuracy are expected for the NSOAS24 model due to the following changes, e.g., supplementing recent mission observations and removing old mission data, optimizing the step size during Green's function method, and special handling in nearshore areas. These optimizations effectively resolved the known issues of signal aliasing and the “hollow phenomenon” in coastal zones. Typical altimetry-derived marine gravity models are the DTU series released by the Technical University of Denmark and the S&S series released by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO), University of California San Diego (UCSD). Their latest models, DTU21 and SS V32.1, were used for comparison and validation. Numerical verification was conducted in three experimental areas (the Mariana Trench area, Mid-Atlantic Ridge area, and Antarctic area, representing low-, mid-, and high-latitude zones) with DTU21, SS V32.1, and shipborne data. Taking NSOAS22 for comparison, NSOAS24 showed improvements of 1.2, 0.7, and 1.0 mGal in the three test areas by validating with SS V32.1, while declines of 0.6, 0.5, and 0.3 mGal and 0.2, 0.4, and 0.3 mGal occurred in SD statistics with DTU21 and shipborne data. Finally, NSOAS24 was assessed using two sets of shipborne data (the early National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) dataset and the later dataset from the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC), the Marine Geoscience Data System (MGDS), the French Oceanographic Cruises Directory (FOCD), and the French Naval Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service (SHOM)) on a global scale. Generally, NSOAS24 (6.33 and 4.95 mGal) showed a comparable accuracy level with DTU21 (6.20 and 4.71 mGal) and SS V32.1 (6.40 and 5.53 mGal) and better accuracy than NSOAS22 (6.64 and 5.64 mGal). The new model is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12730119 (Zhang et al., 2024)."

This feature allows for data exchange between WRF and any other model (e.g. an ocean model) using the coupling library Ocean–Atmosphere–Sea–Ice–Soil Model Coupling Toolkit (OASIS3-MCT). This coupling interface is designed to be non-intrusive, flexible and modular. It also offers the possibility of taking into account the nested zooms used in WRF or in the models with which it is coupled. 
 The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model has been widely used for various applications, especially for solving mesoscale atmospheric dynamics. Its high-order numerical schemes and nesting capability enable high spatial resolution. However, a growing number of applications are demanding more realistic simulations through the incorporation of coupling with new model compartments and an increase in the complexity of the processes considered in the model (e.g., ocean, surface gravity wave, land surface, and chemistry). The present paper details the development and the functionalities of the coupling interface we implemented in WRF. It uses the Ocean–Atmosphere–Sea–Ice–Soil Model Coupling Toolkit (OASIS3-MCT) coupler, which has the advantage of being non-intrusive, efficient, and very flexible to use. OASIS3-MCT has already been implemented in many climate and regional models. This coupling interface is designed with the following baselines: (1) it is structured with a two-level design through two modules: a general coupling module and a coupler-specific module, allowing for easy additions of other couplers if required; (2) variable exchange, coupling frequency, and any potential time and grid transformations are controlled through an external text file, offering great flexibility; and (3) the concepts of external domains and a coupling mask are introduced to facilitate the exchange of fields to/from multiple sources (different models, fields from different models/grids/zooms, etc.). Finally, two examples of applications of ocean–atmosphere coupling are proposed. The first is related to the impact of ocean surface current feedback to the atmospheric boundary layer, and the second concerns the coupling of surface gravity waves with the atmospheric surface layer."

However, reported data inconsistencies and incomplete analysis of potential determinants of thermoelectric water use hinder such understanding. We address these challenges by introducing a novel data filtering method and a more complete assessment of water use determinants. First, we applied a power-cooling ratio as an operations-based data filter that removed operationally implausible records while retaining more original data, outperforming previous statistical filtering methods. Second, we found that different water use reporting methods (WURMs) provided statistically significantly different WW and WC values, revealing the importance of this previously unrecognized feature in reported water use records. Third, our data-driven approach showed that traditionally emphasized features─such as cooling technology and gross generation─are of primary importance but can be surpassed by other, often overlooked, features when modeling WW or WC individually. The plant configuration, cooling technology, and gross generation were the most important features of WW, whereas WURM, cooling technology, and reporting month were the most important for WC.

Here, we compare four data sets─Fuel-Inventory Vehicle Emissions, Neighborhood Emission Mapping Operation, Lake Michigan Air Director Consortium-Northwestern University, and University of Vermont─over the Greater Chicago region at three shared spatial resolutions (1.0, 1.3, and 4 km2). While domain-level data set agreement is strongest at the coarsest resolution, at finer resolutions we find notable inconsistencies, particularly at local scales. At 1 km2, simulated domain total NOx emissions across the four data sets differ up to 82% (∼32–58 k tons/year), while grid cell maximum PM2.5 emissions vary up to 272% (∼1.5–5.5 tons/km2/year). Intercompared emissions data sets share similar inputs; however, divergent outcomes arise from differences in emission factors, simulated vehicle processes, and characterization of traffic data. While domain-level emission burdens among racial/ethnic subgroups are generally ranked similarly across data sets, the magnitude of relative disparities can vary up to 11%–a potentially consequential factor to consider in downstream impact analyses."

However, biodiversity loss driven by the production and consumption of different renewable energy deployment scenarios remains largely unquantified. Quantifying biodiversity loss associated with land occupation of renewable energy infrastructure is essential for a sustainable energy transition. Here, we developed a novel data set to evaluate renewable energy-related biodiversity loss by considering the current infrastructure setting and future development pathways. We found that the land occupation of renewable energy infrastructure resulted in global biodiversity loss equivalent amounting to 19 × 10–4 global pdf in 2015. Severe biodiversity loss was concentrated primarily in densely populated and economically advanced countries, such as China, the United States, Brazil, India, Australia, Russia, and countries across Western Europe. International trade accounted for 14% of the biodiversity loss. Future renewable energy transition scenarios will lead to a global cumulative biodiversity loss of 1.2 × 10–2–2.2 × 10–2 global pdf during 2015–2060. By 2060, ambitious energy transition policies are projected to increase the biodiversity loss by 1.7–1.8 times. The results underscore that while renewable energy could tackle climate change, its deployment should avoid encroaching on biodiversity hotspots."

In this study, 16 soils contaminated from different sources were chosen to determine their Cr accumulation in mouse tissues and changes in Cr speciation in soils, and mouse intestinal contents, organs and excreta based on a steady-state mouse model. The Cr accumulation in mouse organs after exposing to CrVI was 1.6–2.6 fold greater than those exposing to CrIII. Further, Cr relative bioavailability (RBA) was measured using a mouse urinary excretion bioassay. Results show that Cr via oral digestion was mainly accumulated in the kidneys, with Cr-RBA in soils being 5.12–50.0%, averaging 15.6%. Besides soil properties, variation in Cr-RBA also depended on its contamination sources, with soils near electronic waste dismantling and tannery sites showing greater values. Further, instead of the CrVI contents in contaminated soils, Cr-RBA was closely related to the unreduced CrVI contents in mouse intestines, with 90.1% of CrVI being reduced before its absorption. This study helps to evaluate the health risks associated with Cr-contaminated soils by measuring Cr-RBA via a newly developed mouse model and its influence by Cr speciation. Our data suggest a potential risk associated with incidental exposure to Cr-contaminated soils via an oral pathway."

Current approaches to recognize unknown I-DBPs in mass spectrometry (MS) analysis rely on negative ionization mode, in which the characteristic I– fragment can be observed in tandem mass spectra (MS/MS). Still, many I-DBPs ionize exclusively in positive ionization mode, where the I– fragment is absent. To address this gap, this work developed a machine learning-based strategy to recognize iodinated compounds (I-compounds) from their MS/MS in both electrospray positive (ESI+) and negative ionization (ESI−) modes. Investigating over 6000 MS/MS spectra of 381 I-compounds, we first identified five characteristic I-containing neutral losses and one diagnostic I– fragment in ESI+ and ESI– modes, respectively. We then trained Random Forest models and integrated them into IodoFinder, a Python program, to streamline the recognition of I-compounds from raw LC-MS data. IodoFinder accurately recognized over 96% of the 161 I-compound standards in both ionization modes. In its application to DBP mixtures, IodoFinder discovered 19 I-DBPs with annotated structures and an additional 17 with assigned formulas, including 12 novel and 3 confirmed I-DBPs. We envision that IodoFinder will advance the identification of both known and unknown I-compounds in exposome studies."

These challenges make it difficult to analyze and monitor TCs as a class of molecules simultaneously. In this study, a broad-spectrum aptamer capable of recognizing TCs was developed by artificially editing a single-specific aptamer. Subsequently, based on the mathematical proof of broad-spectrum aptamer detection of TCs, an electrochemical sensor was constructed to enable simple and rapid monitoring of TCs with high sensitivity, high selectivity, and a wide detection range. The sensor exhibits a detection range of 0.01 to 1000 nM and a detection limit of 1.18 pM, while maintaining excellent selectivity even in the presence of interfering substances at concentrations up to 100 times the test concentration. This sensor is suitable for quantifying the overall level of TCs in various environmental scenarios, facilitating the study of TCs transport and transformation processes in environmental systems. Finally, the broad-spectrum recognition mechanism of the aptamer was elucidated, which makes the method rational and universal, and will help future researchers to obtain broad-spectrum aptamers for rapid monitoring and analysis of multiple classes of pollutants."

Thus, this study mapped Pb, Ca, and Mg distributions in Chinese cabbage leaves following PM2.5-Pb stress using synchrotron and fast micro-X-ray fluorescence. Findings revealed that PM2.5-Pb was transported and localized in guard cells, the epidermal cell wall, and chloroplasts. X-ray absorption near-edge structure revealed that Pb(CO3)2·Pb(OH)2 in PM2.5 was converted to Pb(OH)2, glutathione-Pb (GSH-Pb), and PbC2O4 in Chinese cabbage leaves.

Glutamate concentration decreased by 44.53% in the LPA variety leaves under PM2.5-Pb stress, increasing GSH-Pb efflux symplasm and reducing Pb accumulation. X-ray fluorescence mapping of Ca and Mg in leaves indicated chlorophyll biosynthesis inhibition in the HPA variety leaves but not in the LPA variety leaves.

Hospital effluents contain both natural and synthetic hormones that might significantly contribute to endocrine disruption in aquatic ecosystems. In this study, HT-EDA has been implemented to identify the main effect-drivers (testosterone, androsterone and norgestrel) from hospital effluent using microplate fractionation, the AR-CALUX bioassay and an efficient data processing workflow. Through nontargeted screening, over 5000 features (ESI+) were initially detected, but our workflow’s prioritization based on androgenic activity prediction reduced the number of features requiring further analysis by over 95%, significantly streamlining the workload. In addition, the semiquantitative nontarget analysis allowed for the calculation of the contribution of an identified compound to the total activity of the sample without the need for reference standards. While this contribution was low (∼4.3%) and applicable to only one compound (1,4-androstadiene-3,17-dione), it presents the first approach for calculating such contributions without relying on standards. Compared to the available alternatives our workflow demonstrates clear environmental relevance by enhancing HT-EDA for more efficient identification and prioritization of effect-drivers in hospital effluents, and it can be adapted to address other environmental threats in complex mixtures."

Here, we present experimental data on Ni isotope fractionation during binding by common Ni-binding amino acids: glutamate (carboxylate side chain), histidine (imidazole side chain), and cysteine (sulfhydryl side chain). We used an equilibrium Donnan dialysis approach to separate free versus bound Ni and measured the isotopic composition of both pools via multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS). Our results reveal that the glutamate and cysteine favor heavy 60Ni (Δ60/58Niglutamate = +0.80 ± 0.08; Δ60/58Nicysteine = +1.27 ± 0.08‰), while histidine causes little isotope shift (−0.12 ± 0.16‰). We then conducted experiments using a short peptide that is a structural analogue for acetyl-CoA synthetase and Ni-iron hydrogenase metal-binding sites. The peptide preferentially bound the heavy 60Ni with a Δ60/58Nipeptide value of +0.74 ± 0.04‰. The Ni isotope effect associated with peptide binding corresponded directly to the fractionation expected based on the coordinating ligands.

However, as a crucial component in high-performance PSCs, highly toxic lead may leak from discarded PSCs and cause environmental and health risks. Implementing the effective recovery of lead from discarded PSCs is crucial for the sustainable development of the PSC industry. Existing lead recovery methods commonly use toxic organic solvents as leaching reagents, i.e., dimethyl formamide and dimethyl sulfoxide, impeding the potential application of recycling technologies. This study proposes a facile ultrasonic water leaching technique for effectively recovering lead from the glass substrate of discarded PSCs. During the ultrasonic water leaching process, the perovskite layer undergoes rapid degradation, generating PbI2. Most of the PbI2 dissolves in the water, yielding a leaching solution containing a low lead concentration, while a minor fraction is converted into insoluble Pb(OH)I particles. The cumulative Pb removal ratio from the first two cycles of ultrasonic water leaching processes can reach 99.84%.

Emissions at engine-driven compressor stations are, on average, 3–4× higher than emissions at turbine-driven compressor stations, thus demonstrating the need for separate emissions factors for engine- and turbine-drive compressor stations. Overall, measurement-informed emissions inventory from midstream transmission and storage compressor stations in NYS is 72% and 69% lower than the current NYS inventory, respectively.

However, it is not clear whether the total light absorption of this BrC is simply the sum of the contributions of the individual components or whether the components can bind noncovalently to give additional absorption through charge transfer. Here, intermolecular interactions between guaiacol and quinones (1,4-benzoquinone and 1,4-naphthoquinone) were identified in proxies of the nonpolar, water-insoluble phase of BBOA, using UV–vis spectroscopy. Guaiacol and its derivatives are some of the most abundant emissions of smoldering coniferous species. Enhanced light absorption occurred instantaneously upon mixing colorless guaiacol with either quinone in n-heptane and did not increase with time, in contrast to the absorbance changes that would be expected for a covalent product. This enhancement decreased by about 25% as the temperature increased from 303 to 323 K, consistent with exothermic association to give complexes, yielding enthalpies of complexation of −13.3 ± 0.6 and −12.3 ± 0.4 kJ mol–1 for guaiacol with benzoquinone and naphthoquinone, respectively. Enhancement was also observed upon gas–liquid partitioning of benzoquinone into thin films of guaiacol, for example, with a thickness of 20 μm.

Here, 51.20% of MPs were extracted from the original DF (samples denoted DF-O). After the subtracting procedure, MPs and their residual (DF-S samples) were divided into two parts. Our results indicated that the DF-O and MPs samples exhibited higher cytotoxicity, inflammatory, and oxidative stress levels than the DF-S samples did. The DF-O and MPs samples suppressed autophagy by decreasing expression levels of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3B), p-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p-PI3K), phosphorylated AKT protein (p-Akt), and p-mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR) while increasing the level of p62. Meanwhile, DF-O and MPs samples induced apoptosis through increasing levels of Bax/Bcl-2 and Cleaved Caspase-3/Caspase-3 in Raw264.7 cells. These trends could be reversed through removing half of the MPs in DF-O. Therefore, dust fall microplastics inhibited autophagy and induced apoptosis via activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, increasing the Bax/Bcl-2 and Cleaved Caspase-3/Caspase-3 ratios.

Here, we show that poly(lactic acid)/poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PLA/PBAT) films undergo ultraviolet photoaging, resulting in increased surface roughness and a higher quantity of MNPs on the surface. This aging process involves the generation of carbon- and oxygen-centered free radicals, chain scission, and the formation of oxidation products with hydroxyl and carbonyl groups. These MNPs can be released under water shear force, significantly increasing the normalized mass loss of aged films to approximately 0.128 mg/cm2 (18 times higher than that of unaged films in water). In the gastrointestinal environment, the normalized mass loss further increases to about 0.196 mg/cm2 (28 times higher), likely due to potential enzymatic digestion and ion-swelling effects. These MNPs, primarily composed of PLA, are smaller and carry more negative charges under gastrointestinal conditions. In the THP-1 cell model, these MNPs affect cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. MNPs obtained through ultrafiltration, compared to those collected via centrifugation, display a broader size distribution and induce more pronounced toxicity in THP-1 cells, with an EC50 of 243 mg/L. Preliminary comparative analysis indicates that PLA/PBAT-derived MNPs present toxicity risks comparable to, or greater than, those of conventional plastic MNPs.

However, the applicability of mucus VTG in aquatic xenoestrogen monitoring warrants comprehensive exploration. Here, we employed different estrogen exposure scenarios to compare the applicability of mucus VTG and other conventional biomarkers in zebrafish for EE monitoring. After acute exposure to 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2) at various concentrations, mucus VTG demonstrated higher sensitivity in male zebrafish than in female zebrafish. Mucus VTG change patterns were similar to liver and blood VTG change patterns in males. Time-course exposure experiments revealed that male mucus VTG responded to EE2 much earlier than male liver and blood VTG, underlining the promise of mucus VTG as an early warning signal of aquatic estrogenicity. Exposure to multiple EEs further validated the high sensitivity of male mucus VTG. Proteomics analysis revealed that EE2 exposure potently shifted the proteome structure of male mucosa, and the VTG1 isoform was noted to be the most suitable biomarker. Overall, our results refine the roles of mucus VTG1 from male fish as a noninvasive, rapid, and sensitive biomarker of aquatic xenoestrogens, applicable to ecological risk assessment for animal welfare and ecosystem protection.

Environmental pollutants could activate astrocytes into A1 (toxic) or A2 (protective) types and induce different effects. Meanwhile, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is an environmental molecule sensor in the body and has various ligands. But the difference between exogenous and endogenous AhR ligands on the astrocytic activation is unclear; in this study, we employed rat primary cultured cortical astrocytes to reveal the effects and mechanisms of AhR ligands on astrocytic activation. We found that, after treatment with exogenous AhR ligand (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, TCDD) ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 nmol/L, astrocytes mainly exhibited A2 type activation. The specific manifestation includes the increase in the expression of A2 marker genes, the enhancement of cellular autonomous movement, the expression and secretion of chemokines, such as Cxcl10, Cxcl2, and Ccl7. And TCDD-induced A2 type astrocytes show a positive impact on neuronal synaptic formation. Although both TCDD and endogenous AhR ligand (6-formylindolo[3,2-b] carbazole, FICZ) could activate AhR pathway in astrocytes, FICZ (50 nmol/L) neither induces activation of A2 type astrocytes nor upregulation of chemokines.

This study aimed to clarify the health impacts of cockroaches by investigating the microbial interactions among cockroaches, the indoor environment, and humans. We simultaneously collected cockroach, indoor environment (indoor air and floor dust), and human (exhaled breath condensate and skin) samples from residential areas in five cities representing distinct climate zones in China. The 16S rDNA sequencing results revealed that cockroaches harbor diverse bacterial populations that vary across different cities. The prevalence of potential pathogenic bacteria (PPB) in cockroaches ranged from 1.1% to 58.9%, with dominant resistance genes conferring resistance to tetracycline, macrolide, and beta-lactam. The relationships between the cockroach microbiome and the associated environmental and human microbiomes were explored by using fast expectation-maximization microbial source tracking (FEAST). The potential contribution of cockroach bacteria to the floor dust-borne microbiome and indoor airborne microbiome was estimated to be 5.6% and 1.3%, respectively. Similarly, the potential contribution of cockroach PPB to the floor dust-borne microbiome and indoor airborne microbiome was calculated to be 4.0% and 1.2%, respectively. In residences with cockroach infestations, the contribution of other sources to the indoor environment was slightly increased.

Quantile-based g-computation and Bayesian kernel machine regression showed a significant inverse relationship between EDC mixtures and the reduced risk of GDM (OR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.13–0.87), which was mainly explained by bisphenol (OR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.29–0.80) and paraben (OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.40–0.91) exposure.

Copper (Cu) is an essential metal involved in neural system, and its homeostasis is the key to maintain its proper function. Herein, the subcellular locations of Cu(I) and Cu(II) in  human neurodegenerative disease SH-SY5Y cells and AD mouse brains were imaged. We found that the content of Cu(II) decreased while that of Cu(I) increased under Aβ exposure, which were further verified in the brain tissues of the AD mouse model, strongly suggesting the disruption of Cu homeostasis under Aβ exposure or AD. Remarkably, the mitochondrial and lysosomal Cu(II) decreased significantly, whereas Cu(I) decreased in mitochondria but increased in lysosome. Lysosomes digested the damaged mitochondria via mitophagy to remove excess Cu(I) and maintain Cu homeostasis. The Aβ induced Cu(I) in mitochondria resulted in an overformation of reactive oxygen species and altered the morphology of this organelle. Due to the oxidative stress, glutathione (GSH) was converted into glutathione disulfide (GSSG), and Cu(I) bound with GSH was further released into the cytoplasm and absorbed by the lysosome. Transcriptomic analysis showed that genes (ATP7A/B) related to Cu transportation were upregulated, whereas genes related to mitochondrial complex were down-regulated, representing the damage of this organelle. This study demonstrated that Aβ exposure caused the disruption of intracellular homeostasis by reducing Cu(II) to Cu(I) and damaging the mitochondria, which further triggered  detoxification by the lysosome.

Previous studies identified deposits of aliphatic organics in and around the Ernutet crater, and at small locations at Inamahari and Urvara craters. The origin of organics, either endogenic or exogenic, in these fresh exposures is still under debate. This study addresses the origin of the organics by analyzing their global distribution and geologic context. Our first step involved a global search for organic‐rich sites that might have escaped previous detections. We achieved this by using a deep neural network, utilizing spectral redness in the Dawn's Framing Camera multispectral data to identify potential organic‐rich sites. The identified sites were further studied by using IR spectrometer data to infer the compositions of materials showing spectral redness. Of the newly identified red‐sloped sites, only two can be considered certain to be organic‐rich. We also identified sites with spectral redness, but without any signature of organics in their infrared spectra. These sites could be attributed to the aqueous alteration of magnetite into ferric‐iron bearing phases. At Ernutet, Inamahari, and Urvara, the organic‐rich material is confined to the near surface only. Additionally, the absence of tectonic/volcanic features at these sites makes an endogenic origin questionable. The global rarity of detectable organics also supports this assessment. Consequently, we suggest that organics at these sites were originally delivered by low‐velocity, organic‐rich impactor(s) from the main belt and subsequently excavated, rather than originating from endogenous processes."

 The lower mantle occupies over half of Earth’s volume, and accordingly, its mineralogy is crucial in determining the structure and dynamics of Earth. Davemaoite, the calcium silicate perovskite, was believed to coexist with bridgmanite in the lower mantle and is considered essential for understanding the chemical evolution and dynamics of Earth’s lower mantle. However, the presence of davemaoite is challenged due to the potential for high calcium silicate solubility in bridgmanite. Here we use an ultrahigh-pressure multi-anvil technique to show experimentally that the calcium solubility in bridgmanite is insufficient to eliminate davemaoite under mantle conditions, including typical mantle pressure, temperature and chemical compositions. We conclude that davemaoite has been stable in Earth’s lower mantle since its formation. Due to the limited calcium solubility in bridgmanite, davemaoite-enriched domains are expected at the core–mantle boundary. These domains could serve as the principal reservoir for incompatible elements in the lower mantle and may be the source for some ocean island basalts. Furthermore, our study offers an explanation for the observed large low-shear-wave-velocity provinces at the bottom of the lower mantle. These provinces may consist of davemaoite-enriched materials crystallized from basal magma ocean in early Earth history.

Here, the authors use genome-wide association meta-analysis to discover psoriasis susceptibility loci and genes, which encode existing and potential new drug targets. 
 Psoriasis is a common, debilitating immune-mediated skin disease. Genetic studies have identified biological mechanisms of psoriasis risk, including those targeted by effective therapies. However, the genetic liability to psoriasis is not fully explained by variation at robustly identified risk loci. To refine the genetic map of psoriasis susceptibility we meta-analysed 18 GWAS comprising 36,466 cases and 458,078 controls and identified 109 distinct psoriasis susceptibility loci, including 46 that have not been previously reported. These include susceptibility variants at loci in which the therapeutic targets IL17RA and AHR are encoded, and deleterious coding variants supporting potential new drug targets (including in STAP2, CPVL and POU2F3). We conducted a transcriptome-wide association study to identify regulatory effects of psoriasis susceptibility variants and cross-referenced these against single cell expression profiles in psoriasis-affected skin, highlighting roles for the transcriptional regulation of haematopoietic cell development and epigenetic modulation of interferon signalling in psoriasis pathobiology.

 Somatic mobilization of LINE-1 (L1) has been implicated in cancer etiology. We analyzed a recent TCGA data release comprised of nearly 5000 pan-cancer paired tumor-normal whole-genome sequencing (WGS) samples and ~9000 tumor RNA samples. We developed TotalReCall an improved algorithm and pipeline for detection of L1 retrotransposition (RT), finding high correlation between L1 expression and “RT burden” per sample. Furthermore, we mathematically model the dual regulatory roles of p53, where mutations in TP53 disrupt regulation of both L1 expression and retrotransposition. We found those with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) heritable TP53 pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants bear similarly high L1 activity compared to matched cancers from patients without LFS, suggesting this population be considered in attempts to target L1 therapeutically. Due to improved sensitivity, we detect over 10 genes beyond TP53 whose mutations correlate with L1, including ATRX, suggesting other, potentially targetable, mechanisms underlying L1 regulation in cancer remain to be discovered.

 Topological dislocation modes resulting from the interplay between spatial dislocations and momentum-space topology have recently attracted significant interest. Here, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate time-dislocation topological modes which are induced by the interplay between temporal dislocations and Floquet-band topology.

 Light-induced phenomena in materials can exhibit exotic behavior that extends beyond equilibrium properties, offering new avenues for understanding and controlling electronic phases. So far, non-equilibrium phenomena in solids have been predominantly explored using femtosecond laser pulses, which generate transient, ultra-fast dynamics. Here, we investigate the steady non-equilibrium regime in graphene induced by a continuous-wave (CW) mid-infrared laser. Our transport measurements reveal signatures of a long-lived Floquet phase, where a non-equilibrium electronic population is stabilized by the interplay between coherent photoexcitation and incoherent phonon cooling. The observation of non-equilibrium steady states using CW lasers stimulates further investigations of low-temperature Floquet phenomena towards Floquet engineering of steady-state phases of matter.

Using high-resolution models, this work shows that western boundary currents will shift shorewards as a result of increased stratification driven by climate change. 
 Subtropical western boundary currents (WBCs) refer to swift narrow oceanic currents that flow along the western edges of global subtropical ocean basins. Earlier studies indicated that the WBCs are extending poleward under a warming climate. However, owing to limited observations and coarse resolution of climate models, how greenhouse warming may affect the zonal structure of the WBCs remains unknown. Here, using seven high-resolution climate models, we find an onshore intensification of the WBCs in a warming climate. The multimodel ensemble mean of onshore acceleration ranges from 0.10 ± 0.08 to 0.51 ± 0.24 cm s−1 per decade over 1950–2050. Enhanced oceanic stratification associated with fast surface warming induces an uplift of the WBCs, leading to the projected change. The onshore intensification could induce anomalous warming that exacerbates coastal marine heatwaves, reduces ability of the coastal oceans to absorb anthropogenic carbon dioxide and destabilizes methane hydrate stored below the sea floor of shelf regions. Western boundary currents flow along the western edge of subtropical oceans, transporting heat polewards, and are integral in the climate system.

N. Vinayachandran,Equatorial convection controls boreal summer intraseasonal oscillations in the present and future climates,"Equatorial convection controls boreal summer intraseasonal oscillations in the present and future climates 
 The boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation (BSISO) is the major mode of tropical intraseasonal variability during the Indian summer monsoon (ISM), it partly controls the dry and wet spells of the ISM and thus is crucial for agricultural yield in the country. Understanding the future of BSISO is essential as it has been established recently that the large-scale BSISO environment enhances the probability of extreme rainfall events enormously. In this study, the ability of Coupled Model Inter Comparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models to capture the northward propagation of boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation (BSISO) is examined using a counting algorithm. A composite moisture budget reveals the difference in moisture dynamics between the above-average-performing (AAPM) and below-average-performing (BAPM) models. The AAPM composite has a stronger horizontal moisture advection ahead of the convection centre than the BAPM composite. The weaker wind and moisture perturbations in the BAPM mainly cause this difference in the horizontal moisture advection between AAPM and BAPM. The BAPM composite shows a weaker equatorial convection signal compared to the AAPM composite, resulting in weaker wind and moisture perturbations and a lesser number of northward propagations. Finally, we understand the future of BSISO by examining the projections of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 370 (SSP370) from the available AAPMs. The background moisture will be enhanced uniformly in the future, leading to no substantial change in gradients. The equatorial convection amplifies and broadens in the future projections, leading to very little change in the wind perturbations. This results in the enhancement of BSISO rainfall by 63% in the Bay of Bengal and 42% in the Arabian Sea. However, the proportion of northward propagations remains the same as moisture advection remains the same. The study implies that with a correct representation of BSISO’s equatorial convection, the prediction of BSISO and extreme rainfall associated with BSISOs becomes more reliable."

 Recent investigations based on sea–air transfer physical mechanistic studies suggest that the global ocean’s contribution to atmospheric microplastic emissions is significantly lower (four orders of magnitude) than previously estimated. However, no atmospheric models or observations have yet validated this lower emission flux, leaving the analysis without adequate validation and practical significance. Here, we provide quantitative estimates of the global atmospheric microplastic budget based on this reduced oceanic flux. Our model aligns well with observed atmospheric microplastic concentrations and suggests that the ocean functions more as a sink than a source, contributing only ~0.008% of global emissions but accounting for ~15% of total deposition. This challenges the previous view of the ocean as the primary atmospheric microplastic source, urging a reassessment of pollution mitigation strategies."

 Climate change and air pollution are interconnected global crises, with concurrent heatwaves and extreme ozone levels threatening public health. This study investigates urban population exposure to concurrent extreme heat and ozone pollution across Chinese cities from 2003 to 2020, using high-resolution (1 km) daily temperature and ozone data. We quantify annual exposure rates at national and city levels, distinguishing contributions from urban population growth and compound event frequency. Findings show a 67% increase in compound exposure over 18 years, with 38% of cities, particularly in the North China Plain, exhibiting significant upward trends. Population growth mainly drives exposure in southern cities, while rising event frequency has a greater impact in northern regions. Core urban areas have become critical hotspots, with some major cities’ centers contributing over 80% to total exposure in 2020.

 The zonal wind in the tropical stratosphere shows a quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), which is an important reference for climate prediction and stratosphere-troposphere interaction. However, the periodicity of the QBO was disrupted during the 2015/16 and 2019/20 Northern Hemisphere winters, raising big challenges to its predictability and attracting widespread attention. Previous studies have indicated that planetary wave (PW) activity from mid-latitude in the lower stratosphere is one of the main sources for the reversal of the zonal wind field, our results show that in addition to that, the presence of dissipated eastward-moving waves in the middle stratosphere can be important for the formation of QBO disruptions. The above two wave signs appear successively before the disruption, exert strong negative forcing on the background flow, and together form a dynamic configuration that occurs before the tropical stratospheric circulation anomalies. It may be necessary to take this PW dynamic configuration into account when predicting future QBO disruptions."

Instead of using local planktonic radiocarbon age, the source water radiocarbon age is derived from global planktonic data weighted by their water mass contributions, with weights simulated by dye tracers. An iterative approach is used to account for the effect of the temporal variation of the atmospheric radiocarbon or the so-called projection age issue. In this ocean model, we demonstrate that our BwP age effectively reproduces the pure water age that results from the interior ocean circulation.

 While the influence of ENSO on Antarctic sea ice variability is well-known, its role in sea ice predictability, both linear and nonlinear, remains unexplored. This study utilizes deep learning models to quantify ENSO’s impact on Antarctic sea ice predictability. We find that ENSO events exert cross-timescale influences on sea ice’s subseasonal linear and nonlinear predictability. Within a 3-week lead time, ice persistence is the primary source of predictability. Beyond this period, ENSO becomes a key source of Antarctic sea ice predictability, with El Niño enhancing ice linear predictability more than La Niña. Specifically, El Niño improves ice linear predictability by 25.6%, 19.6%, and 30.4% in the A-B Sea, Ross Sea, and Indian Ocean, respectively, at an 8-week lead time. La Niña mainly enhances ice nonlinear predictability, particularly in the Ross Sea. We demonstrate that ENSO provides additional sources for Antarctic sea ice predictability primarily through generating more extensive ice anomalies. These insights deepen our understanding of sea ice predictability and are crucial for advancing forecasting models."

 Hydrogen is of interest for decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors because it does not produce carbon dioxide when combusted. However, hydrogen has indirect warming effects. Here we conducted a life cycle assessment of electrolysis and steam methane reforming to assess their emissions while considering hydrogen’s indirect warming effects. We find that the primary factors influencing life cycle climate impacts are the production method and related feedstock emissions rather than the hydrogen leakage and indirect warming potential. A comparison between fossil fuel-based and hydrogen-based steel production and heavy-duty transportation showed a reduction in emissions of 800 to more than 1400 kg carbon dioxide equivalent per tonne of steel and 0.1 to 0.17 kg carbon dioxide equivalent per tonne-km of cargo. While any hydrogen production pathway reduces greenhouse gas emissions for steel, this is not the case for heavy-duty transportation.

Determining the influence of these processes on system dynamics is critical for model design and for prioritizing parameter estimation efforts. Metabolic control analysis is a framework for quantifying the role of enzymes in cellular biochemical networks, but its applicability to biogeochemical and other reactive systems remains unexplored.

 Spring persistent rainfall is a unique climate phenomenon that prevails in East Asia today, providing precious water resources to this densely populated region.

 Sediment resuspension of blue carbon ecosystems (e.g., seagrass beds) and muddy sediments exposes buried particulate organic carbon to oxygenated waters and remineralization, potentially enhancing carbon dioxide fluxes. However, the kinetics of carbon degradation under oxic and anoxic conditions are poorly constrained. We report the results of incubation experiments with sediments from Kiel Bight to simulate sediment resuspension events induced by natural and anthropogenic resuspension in this area. A numerical model determined that oxic carbon remineralization rates were up to two-fold higher than those under anoxic conditions. A coupled sediment-water column model demonstrated that pyrite oxidation, rather than carbon oxidation, has the potential to induce large carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere following anthropogenic sediment disturbance by trawling. Upscaling to muddy areas of Kiel Bight suggests an annual emission of up to ~14 k tonnes of carbon dioxide per year.

 Changes in vegetation carbon uptake are largely influenced by the timing and magnitude of the peak of the growing season (POS), when vegetation photosynthesis reaches its maximum. However, the factors controlling the timing of POS remain poorly understood, leaving us uncertain about its future trajectory. Using satellite observations and carbon flux measurements, we show that, in recent decades, increased early-season carbon uptake has been driven by both an earlier onset of the growing season and higher temperatures. In 93% of northern (>30°N) vegetation, these increases in early-season carbon uptake were associated with an advancement of POS. This ongoing shift suggests a developmental constraint on seasonal productivity, potentially limiting carbon uptake later in the season. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation that reconciles previous observations linking earlier growing season onset, rising temperatures, and shifts in POS timing, and suggest a decrease in late-season carbon uptake with climate warming.

 Observational evidences indicate a significant decline in dust storm frequencies over the East Asian arid-semiarid region during recent decades, which creates a strong contrast with a great increase in sulfate emissions over monsoonal Asia. However, the causes for decline of dust activities are still controversial. Through conducting a set of idealized sensitivity experiments of regional aerosol perturbations, here we show that anthropogenic sulfate aerosols over monsoonal Asia remarkably suppress the regional dust activities over East Asia. Southward shift of Asian westerly jet stream induced by sulfate aerosols results in increasing precipitation and weakening surface wind speeds over the arid-semiarid region, thereby suppressing local dust emission fluxes. Further, the latest Sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project simulations indicate that anthropogenic aerosols partly drive the recent weakening in regional dust activities and that future change of regional dust activities will likely depend on emissions scenarios of Asian anthropogenic aerosols and greenhouse gases.

 The Sustainable Development Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1) is the first satellite developed specifically for implementing the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The multispectral imager (MII) onboard SDGSAT-1 provides advanced capabilities for coastal and inland water environment analysis but requires comprehensive radiometric performance evaluation for effective water monitoring. In this study, the radiometric performance of SDGSAT-1 MII was evaluated for water quality monitoring by assessing its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and radiometric sensitivity to variations in suspended particulate matter (SPM). The SNR was statistically estimated from homogeneous waters over the South China Sea (SCS), and radiometric sensitivity was simulated using the Hydrolight software under varied SPM conditions. Results indicated that SDGSAT-1 MII exhibits significantly improved SNR and radiometric sensitivity compared to commonly used satellite sensors (Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2B MSI), extensively applied in turbid water monitoring. Preliminary validation of SDGSAT-1 MII remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) derived from Acolite DSF against Aeronet-OC measurements demonstrated strong agreement at 438 nm (r2=0.98 and NRMSE = 9.04 %), 495 nm (r2=0.94 and NRMSE = 16.39 %), 553 nm (r2=0.99 and NRMSE = 7.97 %) and 657 nm (r2=0.77 and NRMSE = 35.85 %).

However, the consistency of Rrs at the 401 nm and near-infrared bands (776 nm and 854 nm) was substantially lower relative to other bands. Regarding SPM mapping in the PRE, spatial consistency between the SDGSAT-1 MII and reference sensors remained high (Landsat-8 OLI: r2=0.78 and NRMSE = 19.96 %, Sentinel-3B OLCI: r2=0.78 and NRMSE = 19.96 %). Overall, these findings highlight the strong potential of SDGSAT-1 MII for monitoring coastal turbid waters, while also noting certain spectral limitations, especially for the shorter (401 nm) and near-infrared bands. This study thus offers valuable insights for future improvements in sensor design and operational applications of SDGSAT-1 MII in water quality remote sensing."

 Climate change significantly compromises global water resources, particularly shallow aquifer systems, which are vulnerable to variations in precipitation and evapotranspiration. This study investigated the impacts of climate change on a shallow aquifer system in the Gniezno Lakeland, Poland, by analysing the relationship among ground motion, hydraulic head changes, surface water variations, and meteorological trends. We used EGMS-based InSAR ground motion products to detect subtle land surface displacements across the study area, combined with hydrogeological data, meteorological records, and surface water measurements. Our results revealed a slight but ongoing subsidence of −0.9 mm/year across the area, with variations observed across different land cover types and wetlands being the most affected. Seasonal oscillations in hydraulic head (8–50 cm) and ground motion (2–7 mm) highlighted the aquifer's elastic response to climate variability. Long-term meteorological data indicated a trend towards a drier climate, with annual increases in temperature (+0.5 °C), insolation (+6.8 h), and evaporation (+3.8 mm), coupled with decreasing humidity (−0.13 %/year). The annual negative vertical water exchange, exceeding the volume of groundwater extraction, suggests that climate-driven factors are the primary drivers of aquifer storage decline. The aquifer system exhibited greater resilience to climate change than surface water, as evidenced by its annual storage change (∼2 % of lake volume fluctuations). Localized subsidence patterns near the lake shoreline further underscored the interplay between surface water and groundwater in this region. Our findings provide insights into the impacts of climate change on shallow aquifer systems and highlight the importance of integrating multisource data for comprehensive hydrogeological assessments."

 Soil moisture (SM) is a key state variable in agricultural, hydrological, and ecological studies. Microwave remote sensing can retrieve soil moisture at regional or global scales, but is limited by coarse spatial resolution. In order to generate large-scale, spatiotemporally seamless soil moisture of high precision, we propose a two-stage downscaling and correction cascade learning framework by fusing multi-sourced remote sensing and in-situ data. Under the framework, the Hybrid Attention based residual dense Network for soil moisture Downscaling (HAND) is developed to downscale the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) SM products from 36 km to 1 km effectively. The Random Forest method is subsequently employed to correct the downscaled SM products by in-situ measurements and the 1 km seamless daily SM products of high precision are then generated. The soil moisture downscaling network adopts the Residual Dense connection Network (RDN) as the backbone and embeds a multi-factor interactive attention module, a cross-attention module, and the hybrid attention block with increased/ decreased receptive field, to comprehensively extract the complex relationships between geoscience parameters and soil moisture. The western continental of the United States is served as the study area of this paper, covering 2016–2020. The Pearson correlation (R, unitless) and the Unbiased Root-Mean-Square Error (UbRMSE, m3/m3) values of the HAND downscaled products with SMAP are 0.65 and 0.066 m3/m3, showing the ability of HAND model to achieve satisfactory accuracy while maintaining consistency with original SMAP products, as well as restoring fine spatial details. After the in-situ correction, the R and UbRMSE values of ten-folder cross validation against the in-situ SM reach 0.92 and 0.033m3/m3, while the metrics of SMAP SM against the in-situ SM are 0.46 and 0.083 m3/m3, which demonstrates great potential of the proposed method in water resources management at regional scale."

 New advancements in satellite technology enable more accurate observation of woody population dynamics, providing greater insights into the underlying processes that influence their change. In this study, we evaluate the use of PlanetScope NDVI time series to track the phenology of individual trees in the Sahel, where ground-based environmental surveys are scarce. Five-year NDVI time series were produced for 398 trees with known species recorded in Mali, Senegal, and Niger. Clouds and high aerosol contamination were filtered using MODIS products and focused on the dry season to minimize the influence of background NDVI directly (through crown influence) or indirectly (through adjacency effects). Each NDVI time series profile was fitted with a spline model to obtain the minimum NDVI day of year during the dry season. PlanetScope NDVI time series accurately captured the photosynthetic phenology of individual tree crowns in the Sahel, with discernable differences between individuals and species. When species were grouped based on four phenology types, deciduous and inverse deciduous species exhibited a relatively consistent phenological pattern across all sites. The phenology of semi-evergreen species and evergreen species, which include species with few leaves, was more heterogeneous. Intra-species variation was relatively modest between sites, and most species maintained a similar NDVI profile, with shifts in leaf phenology events correlating with the timing of the wet season in each site. Overlap between the different phenology groups indicates that transitions between phenology types and species are not clear-cut, and even individuals of the same species can demonstrate plasticity. Furthermore, NDVI profiles were extracted for 500 randomly selected tree samples within eight 10 km2 clip boxes distributed along the West African rainfall gradient from 9.9° to 16.6° latitude at −1.6° longitude. This analysis showed a strong relationship between the phenology of woody plants and the timing and distribution of rainfall at each latitude. Green-up of woody vegetation before herbaceous vegetation was marked in the more southern Sahelo-Sudanian latitudes. Additionally, despite the prolonged dry season in the more northern semi-arid latitudes, trees retained their greenness remarkably late into the dry season. Increased air temperature and dryness as a result of climate change could impact tree function in this region and needs individual-based monitoring."

 The Landsat 1–5 Multispectral Scanner (MSS) acquired images in 1972–1992, but their usage is limited, particularly by low geometric accuracy. In the latest USGS Landsat Collection 2 processing, <1 % MSS archive could be geometrically processed to the highest-level Tier 1 category. We present a novel methodology to characterize and correct MSS geometric distortions using Landsat 8 and 9 OLI L1TP images as references, and using a new many-to-many matching strategy applied to MSS and OLI time series to provide large quantities of tie-points needed for effective MSS image geometric characterization and correction. The method is demonstrated at four U.S. sites (Landsat path/rows), including a site over Las Vegas that had significant surface change, and considering 182 MSS and 38 OLI Collection 2 images. Significant and spatially-variable MSS geometric distortions were found, with mean RMSE distortions of 43.2, 25.2, 24.0, 22.2, and 21.0 m for Landsat 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 MSS L1TP images, respectively, and 327.0 m for Landsat 1 MSS L1GS images. After geometric correction, these mean RMSE values were reduced to 12.0, 12.0, 13.8, 12.0 and 11.4 m for the Landsat 1–5 MSS L1TP images, and 15.0 m for the Landsat 1 MSS L1GS images. The geometrically corrected MSS L1TP images acquired over each site were mutually well registered with site mean RMSE values from 9.6 to 20.4 m.

 Forest fires significantly threaten Indonesia’s tropical forests, driven by complex interactions between human activity, environmental conditions and climate variability. This research aims to identify and analyze the factors influencing forest fires in Kalimantan, Sumatra, and Papua during the rainy, dry and all-season conditions using machine learning techniques and create vulnerability prediction maps and categorize risk zones. Eight years (2015–2022) of forest fire data were combined with 15 forest fire susceptible factors that consider of human, environmental, meteorological, and land use/land cover conditioning factors. Random forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) machine learning models were used to train and validate the dataset through hyperparameter tuning and 10-fold cross-validation for accuracy assessment. The XGB model was selected as the best performer based on accuracy, recall, and F1-score and was used to generate probability values. The evaluation showed that the accuracies and AUC values for the nine models were greater than 0.7, with AUC values ranging from 0.71 to 0.95, indicating good performance. Papua had the highest accuracy, with 90.5%, 91.6%, and 92.5% for all, rainy, and dry seasons, respectively. Population density, elevation, precipitation, soil moisture, NDMI, NDVI, distance from roads and settlements, land surface temperature and peatlands are the key contributing factors of forest fire occurrences. Vulnerability maps categorized into five risk zones, identifying high-risk areas that aligned with observed fire occurrences. This research highlighted the diverse characteristics of factors that determine forest fires and examined their impact on fire occurrences. The findings provide actionable insights for targeted fire management strategies, though future research should incorporate additional variables to improve predictive accuracy and address long-term environmental changes."

 In recent years, South Korea has continued to experience high PM2.5 events despite government efforts, posing a significant threat to human life. This study examines the relationship between high winter PM2.5 concentrations in South Korea and atmospheric circulation patterns on synoptic and quasi-biweekly timescales. During the winters of 2018–2022, periodicities of 4–8 and 8–26 days were observed in PM2.5 concentrations, playing a crucial role in high PM2.5 events. Composite analysis revealed that while atmospheric conditions during high PM2.5 events shared similar characteristics, their intensity and spatial extent varied. An anticyclonic anomaly was observed in the upper levels over the Korean Peninsula, and the dipole pattern of the mean sea level pressure (MSLP) weakened the Siberian High, reducing northerly winds and weakening the East Asian winter monsoon. Under this atmospheric circulation, both low planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) and stable atmosphere contribute to high PM2.5 concentrations along with weak ventilation. Anticyclonic anomalies associated with trough intensity originated from different sources: synoptic-scale anomalies from the North Atlantic (∼13 days prior) and quasi-biweekly anomalies from Siberia (∼8 days prior), propagating southeastward as precursor signals. PM2.5 transport contributions differed by timescale: synoptic events were dominated by transport from eastern China, while quasi-biweekly events showed greater contributions from northern China. When overlapping, these timescales exhibited a synergistic effect, creating more favorable conditions for extreme high-concentration events."

 Climate change and the resulting warming caused by human activities, such as releasing greenhouse gases (GHG), notably carbon dioxide (CO2), are paramount concerns in the contemporary era. Therefore, it is essential to understand spatial and temporal variations of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (XCO2) on national and international scales and the role of controlling variables. This research examines the role of controlling variables on XCO2 by utilizing spatiotemporal modeling, correlation analysis, and machine learning methods to determine the sinks and sources of CO2 and their changes in the Middle East (ME). First, XCO2 data from the OCO-2 satellite spanning from 2015 to 2021 were employed for spatiotemporal analysis. The temporal analysis of XCO2 showed peak levels during spring (May) and the lowest levels during summer (September). Additionally, the spatial dispersion of XCO2 revealed significant spatial heterogeneity influenced by land cover. Areas with high vegetation abundance and suitable weather conditions exhibited minimum XCO2 levels, while vice versa occurred. Next, the correlation analysis between the principal controlling variables and XCO2 revealed that, except for vegetation abundance and anthropogenic CO2 emissions, they exhibited predominantly negative and positive correlations throughout the year, respectively. However, the correlation patterns for temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind speed varied across different months, showing both negative and positive relationships depending on the month. Recognizing that simple correlation alone cannot determine which variables played the most significant role in XCO2 each month, this study employed machine learning and Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) techniques. The results showed that, except for March and September, when precipitation and wind speed respectively had the most significant influence on determining XCO2, air temperature played the dominant role in other months. Additionally, the average monthly results revealed that air temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and vegetation abundance, respectively, played the most significant roles in XCO2. In contrast, CO2 emissions had the most negligible impact. These results highlight the considerable influence of meteorological and environmental variables on regulating XCO2 levels and distributions throughout the ME. By elucidating the seasonality of the carbon cycle and identifying key XCO2 drivers over the ME, this study provides valuable insights to guide regional climate change mitigation policies and further analysis of vulnerable semi-arid ecosystems."

 Changing climate has substantially altered the spatio-temporal rainfall pattern, especially over the Indian subcontinent where the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) predominates from June to September. This study explores the changes in the rainfall variability over Northern India (NI) for the period 1981–2020 and this region exhibits topographic diversity, encompassing arid Northwestern India (NWI) due to desert conditions with minimal rainfall and the rainfall-intensive region in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP). In recent decades, a dipolar rainfall pattern has been observed over NI, characterized by a significant increase (reduction) in mean as well as intense rainfall over NWI (IGP). Rainfall intensity over the IGP has decreased by 10.2 %, 7.6 %, and 12 % at the 95th, 99th, and 99.9th percentiles, respectively, while the NWI has increased by 15 % and 9 % at the 95th and 99th percentiles, with a slight 0.17 % decline at the 99.9th percentile. These changes can be attributed to an increase in the frequency of monsoon depressions by about 46 % over the Arabian Sea (AS), while the Bay of Bengal (BoB) has experienced about 32 % decrease. Moreover, increased precipitation in the NWI is characterized by enhanced moisture transport and convergence, a robust low-level jet, unstable atmospheric conditions leading to strong convection. Conversely, the IGP experiences lower moisture transport and convergence, more stable atmospheric conditions, and consequently, reduced precipitation. Furthermore, this study utilizes the Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project of CMIP6 data to investigate the influence of aerosols, greenhouse gases (GHGs), and natural forcings on precipitation patterns. The results reveal a similar dipole spatial pattern of rainfall due to increased aerosol concentration, indicating the role of aerosols in shaping the ISM rainfall patterns. We further employ Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) to assess how aerosol loadings impact ISM characteristics."

We show that the auxin derivative 5-phenyl-indole-3-acetic acid is well tolerated over 2 weeks and drives near-complete CEP192 degradation in less than 1 hour in vivo. CEP192 loss did not affect centriole duplication but decreased γ-tubulin recruitment to centrosomes impairing mitotic spindle assembly. Sustained CEP192 loss in vivo led to cell division failure and cell death in proliferative tissues.

However, their measurement in the heart was not feasible because the required homogenous current injection cannot be performed with electrical stimulation. We overcame this problem by optogenetic current injection into all illuminated cardiomyocytes of mouse hearts in different action potential phases. Precisely triggered and patterned illumination enabled measuringRmand λ, which both were smallest at diastole. Pharmacological and depolarization-induced reduction of inwardly rectifying K+currents (IK1), gap junction block, and cardiac infarction reducedIthr, showing the importance of highIK1density and intact cardiomyocyte coupling for preventing arrhythmia initiation. Combining optogenetic current injection and computer simulations was used to classify pro- and anti-arrhythmic mechanisms based on their effects onRmandIthrand allowed to quantifyIK1inward rectification in the intact heart, identifying reducedIK1rectification as anti-arrhythmic concept."

Here, high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy revealed how two clinically relevant inhibitors block CDK7 function. In cells, CDK7 inhibition rapidly suppressed transcription, but constitutively active genes were disproportionately affected versus stimulus-responsive. Distinct transcription factors (TFs) regulate constitutive versus stimulus-responsive genes. Accordingly, stimulus-responsive TFs were refractory to CDK7 inhibition whereas constitutively active “core” TFs were repressed. Core TFs (n = 78) are predominantly promoter associated and control cell cycle and proliferative gene expression programs across cell types. Mechanistically, rapid suppression of core TF function can occur through CDK7-dependent phosphorylation changes in core TFs and RB1. Moreover, CDK7 inhibition depleted core TF protein levels within hours, consistent with durable target gene suppression. Thus, a major but unappreciated biological function for CDK7 is regulation of a TF cohort that drives proliferation, revealing an apparent universal mechanism by which CDK7 coordinates RNAPII transcription with cell cycle CDK regulation."

We show that SIC-induced radiation anomalies at the top of the atmosphere are sensitive to the location of SIC reduction in each season, which qualitatively explains how and why the effect of sea ice loss on Earth’s energy budget is determined by its spatial pattern. Idealized experiments indicate that SIC-induced surface warming is greater in the Arctic regions, resulting in a more negative Planck feedback. Global low-level cloud cover responses to Arctic and Antarctic SIC reduction are also distinct, leading to more negative SIC-cloud feedback in Arctic regions. SIC-induced albedo feedback is sensitive to latitude due to inhomogeneous solar radiation at the surface. As a result, the simulated radiative effect of SIC anomalies during 1980–2019 is dominated by variations in the spatial pattern of SIC."

One key challenge that these quantum sensors face is improving the sensitivity within a given timeframe while preserving a high dynamic range. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an adaptive entanglement-free cold-atom magnetometry with both superior sensitivity and high dynamic range. Using a tailored adaptive Bayesian quantum estimation algorithm designed for Ramsey interferometry using coherent population trapping (CPT), cold-atom magnetometry facilitates adaptive high-precision detection of a dc magnetic field with high dynamic range. Through implementing a sequence of correlated CPT-Ramsey interferometry, the sensitivity significantly surpasses the standard quantum limit with respect to total interrogation time.

However, GBHs pose a threat to soil fungal community, although fungi can degrade and use glyphosate as a nutrient source. How fungi respond to GBHs remains enigmatic. Here, we found that, not as in plants, the commercial GBH Roundup does not target the 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate synthase in the soil-derived fungusTrichoderma guizhouense, whereas it impairs fungal growth. We demonstrate that the herbicide adjuvant Triton CG-110 is more toxic to fungal cells than pure glyphosate. It limits nitrogen uptake, which induces the expression of proteinase YPS1 to catalyze the shedding of the MSB2 extracellular domain from the plasma membrane, leading to the activation of the MAPK TMK1 pheromone pathway. The downstream B2H2-type transcription factor STE12 directly regulates ergosterol biosynthesis, affecting membrane fluidity and stability.

Here, we introduce the concept of metal blackbody microcavities, comprising thousands of microscale periodic pores created on metals, demonstrating excellent emissivity across visible and infrared (IR) ranges (exceeding 0.94 on average from 0.25 to 20 μm). In the long-wavelength IR (8 to 14 μm) region, near-unity emissivity was successfully achieved by 100-μm-deep metal microcavities with ultralow structural aspect ratios, facilitated by laser-textured multiscale surface morphologies that substantially enhance the light-trapping capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that microcavity-based patterns can produce local emissivity, tunable radiative intensity gradients, wide-angle feasibility, and high-temperature resistance, thereby enabling diverse applications in thermal IR displays such as thermal illusion, IR encryption, and grayscale thermal imaging.

Microglial Gi protein–coupled receptors (Gi-GPCRs) play a critical role in microglia-neuron communications. However, the impact of temporally activating microglial Gi signaling on microglial dynamics and neuronal activity in the homeostatic brain remains largely unknown. In this study, we used Gi-based designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (Gi-DREADD) to selectively and temporally modulate microglial Gi signaling pathway. By integrating this chemogenetic approach with in vivo two-photon imaging, we observed that exogenous activation of microglial Gi signaling transiently inhibited microglial process dynamics, reduced neuronal activity, and impaired neuronal synchronization. These altered neuronal functions were associated with a decrease in interactions between microglia and neuron somata. Together, this study demonstrates that acute, exogenous activation of microglial Gi signaling regulates neuronal circuit function, offering a potential pharmacological target for the neuromodulation through microglia."

In this study, we investigated the fundamentals of applying a solid-state electrolyte (SSE), typically used in battery technologies, as a membrane material for aqueous lithium extraction. We find that the anhydrous hopping of lithium ions through the ordered and confined SSE lattice is highly distinct from ion migration through the hydrated free volumes of conventional nanoporous membranes, thus culminating in unique membrane transport properties. Notably, we reveal that the SSE provides unparalleled performance with respect to ion-ion selectivity, consistently demonstrating lithium ion selectivity values that are immeasurable by even the part-per-billion detection limit of mass spectrometry. Such exceptional selectivity is shown to be the result of the characteristic size and charge exclusion mechanisms of solid-state ion transport, which may be leveraged in the design of next-generation membranes for resource recovery."

Perovskites have superior optoelectronic properties and structural diversity, making them ideal candidates for high-performing direct full-stokes polarimetry. However, perovskite suffers low chiroptical activity due to inefficient chiral transfer, which greatly limits its circular-polarization-vector discrimination. These issues urgently require remedy. Here, we demonstrate that perovskites’ chiroptical activity is highly related to their structural chiral-distortion extent. We propose using halide mixing to construct asymmetric chiral transfer to heighten its structural chiral-distortion extent. Accordingly, we report a 16-fold increment in the optical chiroptical activity. Further ab initio calculations verify that the enhancement is due to the strengthened magnetic transition dipole in mixed-halide structures. We herein report a self-powered, direct full-Stokes polarimetry with a high detectivity up to 1.2 × 1012Jones and low detection errors (ΔS1–3≤ 5.0%).

These samples exhibit a homogeneous single-phase structure at macroscopic and microscopic scales, yet display notable chemical fluctuations at the atomic to nanoscale.

Directional dichroism is the nonreciprocal phenomenon of light; the light transmittance varies depending on the direction of light propagation. It arises from interference between electromagnetic fields of light, resulting in the nonreciprocal transmittance determined by the resonance light absorption. For the maximum interference, it shows one-way transparency, and achieving this is an outstanding experimental challenge. Concerning energy dispersion, the resonance generally occurs only at a specific energy with a narrow bandwidth. When the excited state of the magnon spontaneously decays into lower energy states, the absorption linewidth gets broader.

Jasmonic acid up-regulation was significantly higher in wild-type thanAtseor1/2mutants. Abundant Ca2+influx associated with VPs was responsible for transient sieve element occlusion (SEO) near the flg22 perception site, whereas SEO was absent inAtseor1/2andAtfls2mutants. Biological relevance of SEO was demonstrated by higher susceptibility ofAtseor1/2mutants toPseudomonas syringaethan wild-type plants."

These AI algorithms cannot be modified during the operation process according to environmental changes, resulting in significantly poorer adaptability to new environments, longer learning latency, and higher power consumption compared to the human brain. In contrast, neurobiological circuits can function while simultaneously adapting to changing conditions. Here, we present a brain-inspired Super-Turing AI model based on a synaptic resistor circuit, capable of concurrent real-time inference and learning. Without any prior learning, a circuit of synaptic resistors integrating ferroelectric HfZrO materials was demonstrated to navigate a drone toward a target position while avoiding obstacles in a simulated environment, exhibiting significantly superior learning speed, performance, power consumption, and adaptability compared to computer-based artificial neural networks. Synaptic resistor circuits enable efficient and adaptive Super-Turing AI systems in uncertain and dynamic real-world environments."

While often attributed to nasal mucosa inflammation, the underlying causes of the olfactory loss remain unknown. Here, we characterized gene expression in olfactory epithelium cells from patients with CF using single-nuclei RNA sequencing and found altered expression of olfactory receptors (ORs) and genes related to progenitor cell proliferation. We confirmed these findings in newborn, inflammation-free samples of a CF animal model and further identified ultrastructural alterations in the olfactory epithelium and bulbs of these animals. We established that CFTR, the anion channel whose dysfunction causes CF, is dispensable for odor-evoked signaling in sensory neurons, yet CF animals displayed defective odor-guided behaviors consistent with the morphological and molecular alterations. Our study highlights CF’s major role in modulating epithelial structure and OR expression, shedding light on the mechanisms contributing to olfactory loss in CF."

J. Soppe;Iris Finkemeier;Guillaume Née,DOG1 controls dormancy independently of ABA core signaling kinases regulation by preventing AFP dephosphorylation through AHG1,"Seed dormancy determines germination timing, influencing seed plant adaptation and overall fitness. DELAY OF GERMINATION 1 (DOG1) is a conserved central regulator of dormancy cooperating with the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) through negative regulation of ABA HYPERSENSITIVE GERMINATION (AHG) 1 and AHG3 phosphatases. The current molecular mechanism of DOG1 signaling proposes it regulates the activation of central ABA-related SnRK2 kinases. Here, we unveil DOG1’s functional autonomy from the regulation of ABA core signaling components and unravel its pivotal control over the activation of ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE FIVE BINDING PROTEINs (AFPs). Our data revealed a molecular relay in which AFPs’ genuine activation by AHG1 is contained by DOG1 to prevent the breakdown of maturation-imposed ABA responses independently of ABA-related kinase activation status. This work offers a molecular understanding of how plants fine-tune germination timing, while preserving seed responsiveness to adverse environmental cues, and thus represents a milestone in the realm of conservation and breeding programs."
