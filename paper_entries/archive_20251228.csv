10.5194/acp-25-17047-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文使用地面激光雷达观测数据，分析了2010年至2024年中国中部地区武汉市对流层气溶胶的演变情况。研究重点关注气溶胶的光学厚度（AOD）变化趋势，区分了自然源（沙尘）和人为源（非沙尘）气溶胶的贡献，并探讨了排放控制政策的影响。研究发现，2010-2017年间减排政策效果显著，但之后AOD下降趋势停滞。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它使用了激光雷达这一遥感手段进行大气成分的监测和分析，并探讨了气溶胶对空气质量的影响，以及与排放控制政策的关联。,"['tropospheric aerosols', 'aerosol optical depth (AOD)', 'lidar', 'air quality monitoring', 'emission control policies', 'atmospheric composition', 'dust aerosols', 'anthropogenic aerosols']",Dongzhe Jing;Yun He;Zhenping Yin;Kaiming Huang;Fuchao Liu;Fan Yi,Evolution of tropospheric aerosols over central China during 2010–2024 as observed by lidar,"We present the evolution of tropospheric aerosols over Wuhan, central China, from 2010 to 2024. The analysis highlights the long-term aerosol characteristics and separates natural (dust) and anthropogenic (non-dust) contributions. Emission control policies were highly effective during 2010–2017. However, since 2018, lidar-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) ceased decreasing and fluctuated, and the decline in PM2.5 concentration also became slower, possibly due to atmospheric chemistry factors. 
 Air quality in China has improved significantly over the past decade. However, recent studies show that this progress has notably slowed in recent years. To investigate regional patterns and driving factors, we examined the long-term evolution of tropospheric aerosols over Wuhan (30.5° N, 114.4° E) from 2010 to 2024, using ground-based polarization lidar observations. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) trends are divided into two phases: a declining trend (−0.077 yr−1) during 2010–2017 (Stage I) and a fluctuating period during 2018–2024 (Stage II). Contributions from natural (dust) and anthropogenic (non-dust) aerosols were analyzed separately. Dust optical depth (DOD) consistently declined (−0.011 yr−1) until August 2020 and became larger again afterwards. In Stage I, anthropogenic aerosols (−0.068 yr−1) were responsible for 88.3 % of the total AOD reduction, primarily due to decreases in boundary-layer AOD. In Stage II, anthropogenic AOD fluctuated, possibly due to atmospheric chemistry and meteorological factors. Seasonal variations were also observed. Anthropogenic aerosols appeared from the surface to 2.5 km in summer, with particle extinction and mass concentration of 0.12 km−1 and 83.0 µg m−3, which were concentrated below 0.7 km in winter, with much higher particle extinction and mass concentration of 0.31 km−1 and 211.8 µg m−3. Two case studies highlighted typical pollution events: summertime transboundary agricultural biomass burning smoke in June 2014 and wintertime local anthropogenic aerosol pollution in January 2019. These findings improve our understanding of how regional aerosols respond to local emission controls and long-range transport of dust and smoke."

Organic molecular species exhibited distinct seasonal variabilities and were more abundant and chemically diverse in winter. Anthropogenic pollution played key roles in altering their composition and related properties under various conditions. 
 Biogenic organic aerosols interacting with anthropogenic pollutants lead to large uncertainties in aerosol properties and impacts, yet the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. To explore the anthropogenic–biogenic interactions in the Qinling Mountains region of central China, we investigated the molecular composition of organic aerosols in atmospheric PM2.5 at a forest site in summer and winter of 2021/2022, using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled with Orbitrap mass spectrometry. Organic species were more abundant and chemically diverse in winter compared with those in summer, as revealed by their higher numbers and peak area intensities. The molecular characteristics of organic species exhibited distinct seasonal variabilities, with higher peak-area-weighted mean values of molecular weight and oxidation state but lower unsaturation degree in summer, possibly associated with more biogenic emissions and intense photochemical processes. A variety of organic tracer species were identified in the two seasons, among which the biogenic ones were relatively more abundant in summer, contrasting with the substantial increase of anthropogenic ones in winter. A higher ambient relative humidity, except for heavy precipitation, usually promoted the production of nitrogen- and sulfur-containing organic species by involving more anthropogenic pollutants. The synergistic effects of meteorology and anthropogenic pollution greatly affected the organic aerosol production in this forest atmosphere, thereby altering their molecular composition and related properties under different environmental conditions. The combined set of results herein provides direct evidence for the anthropogenic perturbations on air quality, atmospheric chemistry, and associated climate impacts in the Qinling Mountains region."

We find that the chemical environment and resulting ozone production within smoke changes as plumes evolve, with implications for climate and public health. 
 Tropospheric ozone (O3) production from wildfires is highly uncertain; previous studies have identified both production and loss of O3 in fire-influenced air masses. To capture the total ozone production attributable to a smoke plume, we bridge the gap between near-field fire plume chemistry and aged smoke in the remote troposphere. Using airborne measurements from several major campaigns, we find that fire-ozone production increases with age, with a regime transition from NOx-saturated to NOx-limited conditions, showing that O3 production in well-aged plumes is largely controlled by nitrogen oxides (NOx). Observations in fresh smoke demonstrate that suppressed photochemistry reduces O3 production by ∼ 70 % in units of ppb Ox (O3 + NO2) per ppm CO in the near-field (age < 20 h). We demonstrate that anthropogenic NOx injection into VOC-rich fire plumes drives additional O3 production, sometimes exceeding 50 ppb above background. Using a box model, we explore the evolving sensitivity of O3 production to fire emissions and chemical parameters. We demonstrate the importance of aerosol-induced photochemical suppression over heterogeneous HO2 uptake, validate HONO's importance as an oxidant precursor, and confirm evolving NOx sensitivity. We evaluate GEOS-Chem's performance against these observations, finding the model captures fire-induced O3 enhancements at older ages but overestimates near-field enhancements, fails to capture the magnitude and variability of fire emissions, and does not capture the chemical regime transition. These discrepancies drive biases in normalized ozone production (ΔO3/ΔCO) across plume lifetime, though the model generally captures observed absolute O3 enhancements in fire plumes. GEOS-Chem attributes 2.4 % of the global tropospheric ozone burden and 3.1 % of surface ozone concentrations to fire emissions in 2020, with stronger impacts in regions of frequent burning."
10.5194/acp-25-17125-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要探讨了中国东部地区大气中新粒子形成（NPF）的机制和影响因素。研究发现硫酸和二甲胺可以解释观测到的大气成核现象，并且不同地点成核强度的差异主要归因于温度和前体物浓度。此外，含氧有机分子对新成核粒子的初始生长有重要贡献。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术或卫星观测，但其研究内容与大气成分分析和空气质量监测密切相关，因为新粒子的形成对云凝结核的产生有重要影响，进而影响气候和空气质量。因此，该研究对理解和模拟大气环境变化具有重要意义，并间接与大气环境遥感技术相关。,"['atmospheric new particle formation', 'sulfuric acid', 'dimethylamine', 'oxygenated organic molecules', 'nucleation mechanism', 'air quality', 'atmospheric composition']",Jiaqi Jin;Runlong Cai;Yiliang Liu;Gan Yang;Yueyang Li;Chuang Li;Lei Yao;Jingkun Jiang;Xiuhui Zhang;Lin Wang,Atmospheric new particle formation in the eastern region of China: an investigation on mechanism and influencing factors at multiple sites,"Based on observed atmospheric new particle formation events at multiple sites in eastern China, we find that sulfuric acid and dimethylamine can explain the observed atmospheric nucleation and the differences in the nucleation intensity among campaigns can be largely attributed to temperature and precursor concentrations. Our results also show that oxygenated organic molecules can make a great contribution to the initial growth of freshly nucleated particles in the real atmosphere. 
 As a major source of cloud condensation nuclei, atmospheric new particle formation (NPF) events exert significant influences on the global climate. Among nucleation mechanisms identified in diverse environments, sulfuric acid-amine nucleation is unique for its high efficiency in forming stable clusters and driving intense nucleation. Despite the fact that this nucleation mechanism can explain observed NPF events at individual sites, its applicability to a larger regional scale remains unclear. Here, we analyze the mechanism and influencing factors of NPF at several sites in the eastern region of China, using measured and theoretically predicted particle formation rates and cluster concentrations. Results show that sulfuric acid and dimethylamine can explain the observed atmospheric nucleation and atmospheric conditions including precursor concentrations and temperature cause the differences in NPF characteristics among sites. This indicates the significance of the sulfuric acid-amine nucleation over a large spatial scale in polluted and populated regions. We also find that oxygenated organic molecules are likely involved in the formation of 1.7 nm new particles at these sites by contributing the initial growth of stable sulfuric acid clusters."
10.5194/amt-18-7105-2025,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,该论文主要研究了在极地涡旋条件下，利用地基太赫兹柱总量观测网络(TCCON)反演甲烷(CH4)时出现的系统性误差。研究发现，由于标准反演方法使用的甲烷先验廓形不能准确反映极地涡旋内部的甲烷分布特征，导致反演结果产生与气团质量相关的偏差。通过改进先验廓形，可以有效减小这些偏差。这项研究对于提高北极地区卫星观测数据的验证精度，以及更准确地理解极地涡旋内部的大气成分具有重要意义。,"['methane', 'TCCON', 'XCH4', 'polar vortex', 'air mass dependency', 'satellite validation', 'atmospheric composition', 'remote sensing']",Jonas Hachmeister;Debra Wunch;Erin McGee;Kimberly Strong;Rigel Kivi;Justus Notholt;Thorsten Warneke;Matthias Buschmann,Reduction of airmass-dependent biases in TCCON XCH4 retrievals during polar vortex conditions,"Methane measurements from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) are important for climate research, especially in the Arctic, where few measurements are available. We show that during early spring systematic errors are present in these data that are correlated to the presence of the polar vortex. These errors occur due to the usage of wrong methane prior shapes in the retrieval and can be alleviated by modifying the prior shape accordingly. 
 Trace gas measurements from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) are important for monitoring the global climate system and for validating satellite measurements. In the Arctic, ground-based data coverage is relatively limited due the inherent challenges of conducting measurements in this region (e.g., remoteness, harsh weather). Additionally, solar absorption measurements require sunlight and are not possible during polar night. TCCON measurements from the Arctic sites are of significant value for the validation of satellite data products in this region, as these measurements can extend the spatiotemporal coverage in the Arctic. In this study, we investigate the TCCON methane (CH4) retrieval under polar vortex conditions. The CH4 profile exhibits a distinct shape inside the vortex, which is related to the descent of stratospheric air inside the vortex. We show that the standard TCCON CH4 prior does not sufficiently reproduce this profile shape, leading to air mass dependencies (AMDs), increased spectral residuals, and less sensitive averaging kernels. These effects can be explained by the imperfect vertical sensitivity, especially to the stratosphere. We further show that changes in the prior can improve the retrieval within the polar vortex. This leads to mean differences between 1 and 2 ppb in XCH4 compared to the standard retrieval, as well as maximum differences up to roughly 17 ppb. This paper highlights the importance of understanding the limitations of retrieval methods to avoid misinterpretation of data. Furthermore, it emphasizes the need to investigate the shape of trace gas profiles inside the polar vortex to improve profile-scaling retrievals (PSRs) in the Arctic, which could include in situ data campaigns focusing on inside-vortex air."
10.5194/amt-18-7085-2025,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,该研究论文介绍了一种新型在线设备，用于测量大气颗粒物的氧化潜能（OP），这是一种评估空气污染对健康影响的关键指标。该设备能够近实时地测量颗粒物诱导的氧化应激，并通过比较在线和离线测量结果，验证了其可靠性和准确性。研究结果表明，该设备在空气质量监测方面具有应用潜力，可以更准确地评估空气污染对健康的影响。虽然该研究没有直接涉及卫星观测或遥感技术，但它与大气成分分析和空气质量监测密切相关，这些领域通常与遥感数据结合使用。,"['air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric particulate matter', 'reactive oxygen species (ROS)', 'oxidative potential (OP)', 'PM10', 'PM2.5', 'ozone (O3)']",Albane Barbero;Guilhem Freche;Luc Piard;Lucile Richard;Takoua Mhadhbi;Anouk Marsal;Stephan Houdier;Julie Camman;Mathilde Brezins;Benjamin Golly;Jean-Luc Jaffrezo;Gaëlle Uzu,Qualification of an online device for the measurement of the oxidative potential of atmospheric particulate matter,"Air pollution can harm our health by triggering harmful chemical reactions in our lungs. To better understand this, we developed a new instrument that measures how air particles may cause such effects in near real time. Unlike current methods that may miss key signals, our system captures and analyzes air more efficiently and continuously. Our results show it works reliably, offering a promising new tool to monitor pollution’s health impacts more accurately. 
 Particulate Matter (PM) and gaseous pollutants can carry or induce the production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in the lung environment, causing oxidative stress, a key factor in the development of cardiovascular and pulmonary outcomes. Over the past decade, numerous techniques have been implemented to assess the Oxidative Potential (OP) of aerosols, i.e., their ability to oxidise the lung environment as an initial proxy of subsequent biological processes. Offline measurements from filters collected from air samplers are widely assessed but are probably underestimating PM redox activity due to the short lifetime of several ROS and/or the loss of the most volatile compounds on filters in a non-proportional and unsystematic way. This study introduces a new device, called ROS-Online, allowing the automatic and near real time measurement of two complementary OP assays, OP Ascorbic Acid (OPAA) and OP Dithiothreitol (OPDTT), sensitive to ambient PMs at mass concentrations about [PM10] ∼ 20 µg m−3. The ROS-Online device is designed to reproduce the exposure and interaction of airborne particles with the respiratory system. ROS-Online consists of three main modules: (i) an air sampling module using a BioSampler® to collect airborne PM, (ii) a distribution module that transports samples and reagents to (iii) a measurement module that relies on spectrophotometric methods to monitor chemical reactions in real time. Its operation is based on established OPAA and OPDTT protocols, ensuring comparability with existing offline OP measurement methods. Compact and transportable (75 × 65 × 170 cm, 85 kg), ROS-Online is designed for deployment in air quality monitoring stations and allows for autonomous operation over 2 weeks. With a high particle collection efficiency (> 90 % by mass for PM1 and PM2.5) and greater sensitivity than offline methods, it provides accurate and reliable results across a wide range of aerosol concentrations, from urban backgrounds to highly polluted environments. The qualification of the device demonstrated an excellent correlation with offline methods for both OPAA and OPDTT measurements (r > 0.96), over positive controls, confirming the reliability and specificity of ROS-Online for continuous atmospheric aerosol OP monitoring. ROS-Online was deployed in the field, in an urban background site, where OPAA of ambient air was measured for 15 continuous days and OPDTT for 6 continuous days. Results showed a good correlation with ozone (O3) signal (R2 = 0.74), underlying the importance of considering pollutants' interaction in OP measurements, as laboratory experiment showed no OP response when introducing O3 alone into the instrument. Comparison of ROS-Online measurements with established offline methods showed an excellent correlation for both AA and DTT assays (r > 0.96), supporting its reliability for atmospheric monitoring. These preliminary results mark an important step towards establishing ROS-Online as a viable and effective tool for OP assessment in future research and monitoring endeavours."

By accumulating ions in a trap prior the TOF mass analyzer, we achieve a limit of detection in the 10-3 to 10-6 ppq range with temporal resolutions in the order of 1 s to 10 min, respectively. This makes it highly relevant for atmospheric measurements, as it enables probing short-lived, low-concentration species of high importance in atmospheric chemistry and new particle formation. 
 We have characterised a new Atmospheric-Pressure-interface Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer, equipped with an octapole ion trap for accumulating the sampled ions before orthogonally accelerating them into the mass analyser. The characterisation has been carried out using ion standards produced by electrospray ionisation, that were subsequently mobility-selected by a differential mobility analyser operated at atmospheric pressure. Our results show that the detection sensitivity (or limit of detection) of the mass spectrometer is in the parts per quintillion (i.e., 10−3 parts per quadrillion, ppq; which is ∼ 30 ions cm−3) range with temporal resolutions of 1 s. When increasing the temporal resolution up to 1 min, the detection sensitivity can be reduced to the 10 parts per sextillion (i.e., 10−5 ppq; which is ∼ 0.3 ions cm−3) range, enabling the system to measure gaseous ions of extremely low concentrations. In contrast to other mass spectrometers that employ spectra accumulation to improve the detection sensitivity for atmospheric observations, ion accumulation amplifies the signal without increasing the noise level; something that among others is highly important for probing short-lived ionic clusters during new particle formation events in the atmospheric environment. We also show that the mass spectrometer has a transmission of up to 1 %, and a mass resolution of 23 000 for ionic masses of ca. 600 Da, while it can be used in ways to induce collision dissociation of the sampled ions by tuning the operating conditions of the Atmospheric-Pressure-interface stage."

Tuinder,Long-term solar-induced fluorescence data record from GOME-2A and GOME-2B (2007–2023) using the SIFTER v3 algorithm,"The GOME-2 series offers a long solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) record, but sensor-specific instrumental artefacts diverge intersensor observations. We developed a combined GOME-2 SIF record (2007–2023) from GOME-2A and GOME-2B SIF using the SIFTER v3 algorithm, which corrects these artefacts. Both records show strong spatial and temporal coherence. A framework is provided to detect and, if needed, correct intersensor offsets, supporting consistent long-term monitoring of vegetation dynamics. 
 Design differences in sensors and retrieval algorithms complicate the harmonisation of space-based solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) observations. The GOME-2 series, with its identical sensor design, offers potential for constructing a long-term coherent record. However, instrumental artefacts, such as degradation, affect the sensors differently and diverge the intersensor SIF observations. Achieving internal consistency within each record is therefore a critical first step in harmonisation. We present a combined GOME-2 SIF dataset for 2007–2023 that consists of GOME-2A (Jan. 2007–Dec. 2017) and GOME-2B SIF (July 2013–Dec. 2023) data. Both individual records are retrieved using the previously developed SIFTER v3 algorithm, which applies time-, wavelength-, and scan-angle-dependent degradation corrections. Spatial agreement between GOME-2A and GOME-2B SIF during the overlapping period was strong (r ≥ 0.96), although viewing geometry differences caused substantial systematic biases, specifically over high activity regions; these were reduced to within 2 % by constraining to common viewing zenith angle ranges. In terms of temporal alignment, most analysed regions showed no significant step change at the July 2013 sensor transition, from full-swath GOME-2A to GOME-2B SIF. Small offsets in Eastern China and the Amazon were corrected for using a simple additive correction, which improved the coherence and agreement with independent GPP estimations from FluxSat. Finally, the GOME-2 records align closely with FluxSat GPP and TROPOMI SIF across various biomes, and support monitoring of vegetation activity over 17 years. Our work presents a framework for detecting and, when necessary, correcting intersensor offset biases, enabling the use of GOME-2A and GOME-2B SIF as a single record. Moreover, it offers guidance for harmonising multi-sensor datasets and for other causes of potential structural breaks in long-term observation records.

This helps scientists estimate how easily these compounds evaporate, which is important for understanding air pollution and climate. We tested the program using real-world data and found it to be highly accurate. Our work makes it faster and easier to study the behavior of many complex chemicals in the atmosphere. 
 Volatile organic compounds play a significant role in atmospheric chemistry, influencing air quality and climate change. Accurate prediction of their physical properties is essential for understanding their behavior. This paper introduces VaPOrS (Vapor Pressure in Organics via SMILES) as a comprehensive tool designed to process SMILES notation of organic compounds, identify key functional groups, and apply group-contribution methods for property estimation. The core innovation of VaPOrS lies in its self-contained functional group recognition algorithm, which eliminates dependence on external cheminformatics libraries. The current approach enables fully auditable, easily modifiable, and computationally efficient detection of 30 functional groups required by the SIMPOL method. Compared to existing tools, VaPOrS avoids heavy SMILES-to-graph conversions and can obviate interface overhead, providing orders-of-magnitude speedups for large-scale atmospheric modeling scenarios. While this first implementation focuses on the SIMPOL method for estimating saturation vapor pressure and enthalpy of vaporization, the framework is readily extendable to other group-contribution schemes and thermodynamic properties (e.g., partition coefficients, volatility basis set models, solubility, Henry's law constants). The tool has been validated against manually counted functional groups and experimental saturation vapor pressure data for a diverse set of compounds. Results demonstrate excellent agreement with both the original SIMPOL model and experimental observations, while comparisons with existing tools highlight the robustness and accuracy of the new parsing functions. VaPOrS thus provides a generalizable and computationally efficient platform for property prediction of large molecular datasets, facilitating integration into chemical transport and climate models and streamlining the analysis of thousands of organic compounds in atmospheric science applications."

 Methanesulfonic acid, a key oxidation product of dimethyl sulfide, plays a crucial role in the atmospheric sulfur cycle and is an important contributor to aerosol growth and cloud condensation nuclei formation in remote marine and polar atmospheres. Its role is particularly significant in the Southern Ocean, where particle concentrations are low and biogenic sulfur emissions help shape cloud properties. Here, we focus on an eight-day period during the austral summer along coastal East Antarctica marked by elevated gaseous MSA that coincided with persistent katabatic outflow. By combining our ship-based observations, back-trajectory analysis and thermodynamic modelling, we show that this outflow brings biogenically dominated, highly acidic aerosols with elevated gaseous methanesulfonic acid produced by evaporation from aerosol particles. Although a decrease in relative humidity can enhance this process, aerosol acidity is identified as the primary driver. Our findings highlight the strongly acidic nature of Southern Ocean aerosol and provide new insights into processes involved in the marine sulfur cycle.

Chan;Claudia Mohr;Janne Rinne,BVOC and speciated monoterpene concentrations and fluxes at a Scandinavian boreal forest,"Ecosystem-scale emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) are important for atmospheric chemistry. Here we investigate boreal BVOC fluxes from a forest in central Sweden. BVOC fluxes were measured above-canopy using proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry, while compound-specific monoterpene (MT) fluxes were assessed using a concentration gradient method. We also evaluate the impact of chemical degradation on observed sesquiterpene (SQT) and nighttime MT fluxes. 
 Boreal forests emit terpenoid biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) that significantly affect atmospheric chemistry. Our understanding of the variation of BVOC species emitted from boreal ecosystems is based on relatively few datasets, especially at the ecosystem-level. We conducted measurements to obtain BVOC flux observations above the boreal forest at the ICOS (Integrated Carbon Observation System) station Norunda in central Sweden. The goal was to study concentrations and fluxes of terpenoids, including isoprene, speciated monoterpenes (MTs), and sesquiterpenes (SQTs), during a Scandinavian summer. Measurements (10 Hz sampling) from a Vocus proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Vocus PTR-ToF-MS) were used to quantify a wide range of BVOC fluxes, including total MT (386 (± 5) ng m−2 s−1; β=0.1 °C−1), using the eddy-covariance (EC) method. Surface-layer gradient (SLG) flux measurements were performed on selected daytime sampling periods, using thermal-desorption adsorbent tube sampling, to establish speciated MT fluxes. The effect of chemical degradation on measured terpenoid fluxes relative to surface exchange rates (F/E) was also investigated using stochastic Lagrangian transport modeling in forest-canopy. While the effect on isoprene was within EC-flux uncertainty (FISO/EISO <  5 %), the effect on SQT and nighttime MT was significant, with average F/E ratios for nighttime FMT/EMT= ca. 0.9 (0.87–0.93), nighttime FSQT/ESQT=0.35 (0.31–0.41), and daytime FSQT/ESQT=0.41 (0.37–0.47). The main compounds contributing to MT flux were α-pinene and Δ3-carene. Summer shifts in speciated MT emissions for Δ3-carene were detected, featuring a decrease in its relative fraction among observed MT compounds from June to August sampling periods, indicating that closer attention to seasonality of individual MT species in BVOC emission and climate models is warranted."

We describe how operational numerical weather prediction can help determine the model uncertainties and thereby improve the emission estimates. We test our system using simulated observations. 
 This two-part study explores the quantification of greenhouse gas emissions using atmospheric observations in order to validate national emission inventories. Inverse methods can support emission quantification at the national scale based on observations and atmospheric transport simulations, yet, they are often limited by the observation coverage, transport model uncertainties, and inversion methodologies. Here, we introduce a system for regional estimation of methane fluxes and apply this to Central Europe with a focus on Germany, where we distinguish emissions from different anthropogenic sectors. We evaluate the robustness of the method using sensitivity tests with in-situ observations from the Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS). Using synthetic observation experiments, we estimate the impact of transport errors on the flux estimates. The atmospheric transport is calculated employing the numerical weather prediction model ICON with its module ART at 6.5 km resolution, sampling the meteorological uncertainty with a 12-member transport ensemble. The same transport ensemble is used to generate pseudo-observations with a simulated transport uncertainty. Posterior fluxes are estimated with a synthesis inversion method for three different approximations of the model–observation error covariance matrix. We find that using ensemble-estimated transport uncertainties can significantly reduce the random error of emission estimates. Our results highlight the importance of analyzing biases in flux inversions for reliable, observation-based emission estimates."

We estimate German methane emissions (32±19) % higher than the anthropogenic emissions in the national inventory, and our inversion method attributes this difference mainly to the agricultural sector, although separation from Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) as well as natural fluxes requires further research. The combination of an ensemble-enhanced numerical weather prediction model for atmospheric transport and good observation coverage paves the way to sector-specific, observation-based national emission estimates."

Active measurements are used to train and validate a newly developed random forest algorithm that is applied to passive satellite imagery to estimate the ice crystal icing conditions probability. 83 % of ice crystal icing conditions are correctly detected, showing potential for an operational implementation to mitigate its negative effects on the fleet. 
 High ice water content (HIWC) conditions are a concern for aviation as the ingestion of ice particles in the jet engines can induce ice crystal icing (ICI), which results in performance loss and damage. To constantly monitor these conditions, retrievals for the detection of ICI were recently developed based on geostationary satellite imagery, but their calibration is limited to targeted flight campaigns or scattered samplings from ICI events databases. In this work, we close this gap, using exclusively remote sensing data to develop and assess a new retrieval for potential ICI conditions.Cloud IWC measurements are provided from the synergy of radar and lidar (DARDAR) on board the polar-orbiting satellites CloudSat and CALIPSO. HIWC conditions (IWC≥0.5 g m−3) at typical cruise altitudes are used as the proxy for areas with potential ICI formation. The HIWC conditions predictors are taken from a combination of observations and retrievals of the geostationary satellite Meteosat Second Generation (MSG). A random forest is trained and tested based on the collocated dataset of active and passive measurements during the summer months of 2013 and 2015, covering the European domain. The input predictors are the brightness temperature difference between the MSG channels at 6.2 and 10.8 µm wavelengths, the visible channel at 0.6 µm wavelength, the cloud optical thickness at 0.6 µm wavelength, and four convection metrics related to the distance to the closest convective cell, area extent of the convective cells, and convection density in the pixel surroundings. Over Europe, 83 % of HIWC conditions measured in the DARDAR dataset are correctly detected. The associated false alarm rate is 51 %. The retrieval is further tested with the ICI events database reported by Lufthansa. Four out of seven events are correctly detected. In conclusion, the retrieval achieves performances comparable to previously developed retrievals. An operational application would enable aircraft rerouting around areas with high ICI probability."

But the major drawback was the larger uncertainties associated with the measurements. To minimize the uncertainties, improved calibration standards, measurement techniques and sensors were developed. In this study we are validating the a newly developed Bi-Tec sensor spectroradiometer with an average uncertainty of 0.53 % with world radiometric reference (WRR) and international system of units (SI). 
 Accurate, precise and traceable measurements of total and spectral solar irradiance measurements are fundamental for solar energy applications, climate studies, and satellite validation. In this study, we assess the performance and the quality of the data from a commercially available, compact Bi-Tec Sensor (BTS) Spectroradiometer system, by comparing its spectrally integrated total solar irradiance (TSI) values with an electric substitution cavity radiometer (PMO2), which is traceable to the World Radiometric Reference (WRR). The resulting ratio between BTS Spectroradiometer system and WRR-traceable TSI is 0.9975 with a standard deviation of 0.0050. Applying a correction factor of (–) 0.34 % to PMO2, accounting for the known offset between WRR and the International system of Units (SI) results in a relative difference between the BTS Spectroradiometer system derived TSI and PMO2 of +0.09 % with a standard deviation of 0.0050 demonstrating good consistency between BTS derived TSI and the cavity radiometer.This comparison confirms the precision and accuracy of the BTS spectroradiometer system, and its capability to deliver SI traceable TSI from spectrally resolved solar irradiance measurements. Its spectral resolution enables accurate measurements of spectral solar irradiance, which are essential, not only for determining total solar irradiance but also for retrieving key atmospheric gases such as water vapor, ozone, and aerosols, establishing its relevance as a compact instrument for atmospheric and climate research."

Biases in the often-uncertain BCs propagate to the inferred fluxes. We develop a framework to explain how errors in the BCs influence the optimized fluxes, derive two metrics to estimate this influence, and compare two methods to correct for the biases. We demonstrate correcting BCs directly is more effective at reducing bias. 
 Regional inverse analyses of atmospheric trace gas observations quantify gridded two-dimensional surface fluxes by fitting the observations to simulated concentrations from a transport model, usually by Bayesian optimization regularized by a gridded prior flux estimate. Regional inversions rely on the specification of background concentrations given by the boundary conditions (BCs) at the edges of the inversion domain, but biases in the BCs propagate to biases in the optimized fluxes. We develop a theoretical framework to explain how errors in the BCs influence the optimized fluxes as a function of the prior and observing system error statistics and of model transport. We derive a preview metric to estimate the BC-induced errors before conducting an inversion to support domain specification and a diagnostic metric to accurately quantify these errors after solving the inversion. We compare two methods to correct BC biases as part of an inversion, either directly by optimizing BC concentrations (boundary method) or indirectly by expanding the domain and correcting grid cell fluxes outside the region of interest (buffer method). We demonstrate that the boundary method is generally more accurate, physically grounded, and computationally tractable."

A k‐means cluster analysis revealed the Madden‐Julian Oscillation, breaks in the South Asian summer monsoon, and a decaying Arabian heat low as the primary atmospheric processes governing convective events. Observed trends indicate a significant increase (∼1.42 convective days per year) from 2000 to 2024 in convective events, consistent with regional warming and enhanced boundary layer instability.

A novel index of convective rainfall deviation is defined in this study to quantify the spatial discrepancy between surface rainfall and cold‐cloud shields, utilizing the FY‐4A brightness temperature data and surface rainfall observation data from across China. The results show that systems with larger deviations are more prevalent in southern China. For small‐deviation systems, surface rainfall closely coincides with the coldest center of the cloud shields. However, in medium‐deviation systems, rainfall occurs southwest of the coldest center, with relatively expanded but weakened rainfall beneath the cloud shields. Retaining a pronounced southwestern deviation signature, large‐deviation systems also present a secondary northeastern rainfall center.

A U‐Net model is developed to estimate warm‐season turbulence intensity at four vertical layers using data from GEO‐KOMPSAT‐2A. The model is trained on turbulence diagnostics derived from the outputs of the Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System. Evaluation against in situ turbulence measurements shows good performance at the lower three layers, with slightly reduced accuracy at the tropopause and above.

These processes, difficult to observe directly, are diagnosed from satellite retrievals of precipitation (P) and atmospheric cloud radiative effect (ACRE) with the aid of a simple theory. It is found that hourly changes of P and ACRE projected onto the P‐ACRE plane have a tendency of pointing toward a settling point at LP ∼ ${\sim} $ 700 W m−2 ${\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$ and ACRE ∼ ${\sim} $ 75 W m−2 ${\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$, corresponding to a state of midheavy ascent. These physically driven transitions are counteracted largely by inverse transitions ascribed mainly to the stochastic effects due to a sample density gradient, except where samples are very few. The net effect of these mutually competing transitions is an evolutionary path qualitatively reminiscent of the known Lagrangian life cycle of a traveling convective system, whereas the P‐ACRE trajectory stays in the close vicinity of the settling point when spatially averaged over the system."

It provides an unprecedented observational source for enhancing numerical weather prediction (NWP), especially for high‐impact weather events. Currently, GIIRS is limited to clear‐sky radiance assimilation in operational system, and a large amount of cloud‐affected data have not been effectively utilized. The cloud‐clearing technology can eliminate the cloud effects to obtain the cloud‐cleared radiances (CCRs), which is an alternative method to realize the assimilation of cloudy‐sky infrared observation. A high‐precision cloud mask retrieved from the Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) is used to calculate the GIIRS CCRs in this study. A comparative analysis of the bias characteristics reveals that the CCRs exhibit larger standard deviation of O‐B than clear‐sky radiances. To evaluate the impact of GIIRS CCRs on NWP, a 1‐month cycle assimilation and forecast experiments are carried out based on China Meteorological Administration Global Forecast System (CMA‐GFS). The results show that CCRs increase the amount of assimilated GIIRS observations by nearly 50%. Compared with the control experiment, CCRs assimilation has a modest positive contribution to the analysis fields, including geopotential height, low‐level humidity, and wind fields. Additionally, it improves the forecast fields of geopotential height and precipitation skill scores, demonstrating better forecast potential in typhoon weather processes. This study provides valuable insights for the prospective operational application of FY‐4B GIIRS CCRs in NWP."

 Low-cost air quality sensors have shown great promise as a complement to high-cost reference and equivalent methods. Though not currently as accurate, their low barrier of entry and smaller form factor allow them to be deployed in greater numbers, thus enabling air quality measurements to be made at a far higher spatial and temporal resolution than previously possible. However, their measurements require corrections as they suffer from both short-term biases (e.g., changes in environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity), and long-term measurement drift due to degradation. Many studies have focused on calibration and re-calibration of sensors, but fewer focus on correcting pre-calibrated sensor measurements. Correcting measurements is a likely scenario for people buying off-the-shelf devices, as they will not have access to the raw data that underpins the measurements, such as sensor voltages. Previous studies focused on a small range of correction techniques, without accounting for the variances that can occur between devices or locations. This work aimed to perform a comprehensive assessment of different correction techniques applied to air quality sensor systems. More than 470,000 unique measurement corrections were tested across two sites to determine best practices for correction campaigns going forward, resulting in a far more robust study than previous works. It highlights the large variances in results that occurred between sites, particularly for NO2, with results often more impacted by device type and location than the regression technique used. Simpler linear models were also found to perform just as well as, and sometimes better than, more complex non-parametric techniques. This study highlights that, though a strong focus is often put on comparing different regression methods, the choice of technique has less impact than the configuration of the device or the conditions of the co-location site. Therefore, future studies should focus less on small-scale comparisons of regression techniques and more on how to improve the transferability and applicability of results from a co-location campaign to another.

Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a leading global health risk. Latin American cities exhibit some of the world’s highest urban PM2.5 levels, yet studies of neighborhood-level PM2.5 exposure and associated disparities in the region are limited. Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional ecological analysis of 53 041 neighborhoods across 340 cities in eight Latin American countries, leveraging the Salud Urbana en America Latina study dataset. Annual PM2.5 concentrations were derived from satellite data and linked to socioeconomic and urban characteristics. A multilevel model analyzed associations between neighborhood PM2.5 levels and neighborhood- and city-level characteristics. Results. The median annual neighborhood PM2.5 concentration was 18.49 µg m−3. Of the 256 million residents, all lived in neighborhoods with ambient PM2.5 concentrations that exceeded the 2021 World Health Organization guidelines (5 µg m−3). Variability was greatest between cities (54.3% of total variance), but substantial within-city variation (26% of variance) was observed. Higher neighborhood PM2.5 levels were associated with higher neighborhood educational attainment (mean difference [MD] comparing top to bottom tertile = 0.17 µg m−3), higher neighborhood intersection density (MD comparing top to bottom tertile = 0.17 µg m−3), and older cities (MD comparing top to bottom tertile = 1.45 µg m−3). Lower neighborhood PM2.5 levels were related to higher neighborhood population density (MD comparing top to bottom tertile = − 0.55 µg m−3), more greenness (MD comparing top to bottom tertile = − 0.76 µg m−3), and larger distance from city centers (MD comparing top to bottom tertile = − 0.86 µg m−3). Conclusions. Neighborhoods with higher PM2.5 concentrations tended to have higher educational attainment, more intersections, and be located in older cities, while lower concentrations were associated with denser populations, more green space, and greater distance from city centers. Our findings reveal important within-city heterogeneity in PM2.5 and the factors associated with it, suggesting strategies to mitigate air pollution within cities."

Geostationary satellite shows that neglecting the diurnal variations leads to an underestimation (up to 89 %) of the cooling effect induced by changes in cloud albedo due to aerosol perturbations. The results provide new insights in aerosol-cloud interactions, verifying this is a significant yet often overlooked source of uncertainty. 
 Aerosol-cloud interaction (ACI) remains a key uncertainty in climate projections. A major challenge is that the sign and magnitude of cloud liquid water path (LWP) response to aerosol perturbations (represented by cloud droplet number concentration, Nd) at different temporal and spatial scales are highly variable, but potential microphysical-dynamical mechanisms are still unclear, especially at a diurnal scale. Here, Himawari-8 retrievals were used to investigate LWP adjustments in two distinct cloud regions: the stratocumulus region off the western Australia (AUW) and clouds over the East China Sea (ECS) characterized by a transition from stratocumulus to cumulus under strong anthropogenic influences. In the ECS region, LWP exhibits a unique pronounced rising (positive LWP adjustments) at high Nd. Results indicate that this pattern is driven by northerly cold-air advection during the cold seasons, which enhances surface fluxes and subsequently leads to increases in both LWP and Nd. Furthermore, the diurnal variation of LWP adjustments is likely driven by cloud-top entrainment in the ECS region, but is primarily associated with diurnal-related boundary layer decoupling in the AUW region. The results indicate that neglecting diurnal variations of LWP adjustments leads to an underestimation (up to 89 %) of the cooling effect induced by changes in cloud albedo due to aerosol perturbations in the AUW. The bias spans from a 32 % overestimation to a 37 % underestimation in the ECS. Our findings highlight the key role of diurnal variations of ACI in reducing the uncertainty in climate projections."

Partridge;Ilona Riipinen,Optimizing CCN predictions through inferred modal aerosol composition – a boreal forest case study,"We use multi-year measurements of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) at a boreal forest site to inversely infer size-resolved aerosol chemical composition. We find that inorganic species are more enriched in the larger end (accumulation mode) of the sub-micron aerosol population while organics often dominate the smaller end (Aitken mode). Our approach demonstrates the potential of long-term CCN measurements to infer size-resolved chemical composition of sub-micron aerosol. 
 The contribution of natural aerosol particles from boreal forests to total aerosol loadings may increase with reduction in anthropogenic emissions. Aitken and accumulation mode particles in boreal regions differ significantly in hygroscopicity, and ignoring this size dependence can cause large uncertainty in Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) prediction. We applied κ-Köhler theory to a multi-year dataset (2016–2020) from Hyytiälä, Finland, to evaluate different representations of aerosol chemical composition for CCN prediction. Overpredictions by forward closures using either bulk chemical composition from an Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM) or a constant κ= 0.18 were mitigated to a great extent by optimizing size-resolved composition using two inverse modeling approaches: (1) Nelder–Mead method with the size distribution fixed to its median during each 2 h CCN measurement cycle, and (2) MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) accounting also for the variability in the size distribution during each cycle. Both methods improved closure at  SS =  0.2 %–1.0 % (with Geometric Mean Bias GMB values 1.12–1.20 and 0.95–1.05, respectively), with moderate improvement at 0.1 % (GMBs of 1.53 and 1.32, respectively). The Aitken mode was enriched in organics in 77 % of cases using method (1) and 46 % using method (2) – with typical κ values of ∼ 0.1 for Aitken and ∼ 0.3 for accumulation modes. The results generally align with known size-dependent chemical composition in Hyytiälä and indicate that variability in CCN hygroscopicity is largely driven by Aitken mode composition. Our results demonstrate the potential of inverse CCN closure methods for obtaining valuable information of the size-dependent chemical composition."

Simpas;Miguel Ricardo A. Hilario;Armin Sorooshian,Technical note: Apportionment of Southeast Asian biomass burning and urban influence via in situ  trace gas enhancement ratios,"Both fire and urban emissions are major contributors to air pollution in Southeast Asia. Relative increases in measurements of methane and carbon monoxide gases during an aircraft campaign near the Philippines in 2019 were used to isolate pollution emissions from fires vs. urban sources. Results were compared to atmospheric transport models to determine the sources' regional origins, and relationships between pollution indicators relevant to poor air quality were investigated for each source. 
 Correlations in airborne in situ gas enhancement ratios of CH4 to CO from the 2019 Cloud, Aerosol and Monsoon Processes Philippines Experiment (CAMP2Ex) field project over the Sulu, Philippine, and South China Seas were used to distinguish air masses with predominantly biomass burning, urban, or mixed influence, and identifying contributions from differing urban sources. Two approaches were created to produce a final data flag: one using a singular background for CO and CH4 enhancement ratios and another determining enhancement ratios via linear regression of 4 min bins along the timeseries. HYSPLIT back trajectory analysis was used to identify air mass origins, and the resulting source regimes were examined for differences in ozone, reactive nitrogen, and aerosol chemical composition. ΔO3/ΔCO enhancement ratios were observed to be constant between urban source regimes, yet ΔNOy/ΔCO enhancement ratios differed across these regimes. For biomass burning sources, enhancement ratios in ΔO3/ΔCO were over a factor of two lower than those reported by previous studies in this region. Organic aerosol mass fractions were observed to be 2–3 times higher in biomass burning influenced regimes compared to urban regimes. This technique represents a simple yet powerful approach for separating emission influences in a chemically complex environment that enables identification and characterization of emission sources using exclusively routine measurements that can be accomplished with commonly available instrumentation."

By deliberately changing the timing of fires in this region, the climate effect (radiative forcing) of a fire season can be altered. We show that by burning earlier in the dry season a small climate cooling effect can be achieved, similar to that of a 10 % reduction in global commercial aviation emissions. Local effects must be considered before implementing a fire regime shift for climate change mitigation. 
 Landscape fires emit climate-influencing greenhouse gases and aerosols. The vast majority of landscape fire emissions originate from tropical savannas, especially in Africa. During the fire season climatic conditions change, and fires burning later consume drier vegetation and occur in drier weather conditions than earlier fires. Previous studies have shown that it is possible to reduce emissions of some greenhouse gases (CH4 and N2O) by using “prescribed” fires, i.e. deliberate burning in the early dry season. In this study we examine the climate effect of (deliberately) changing fire regimes beyond CH4 and N2O, including aerosols and other short-lived species, CO2, and changes to surface albedo. We find that in general shifting burning earlier in a single fire season results in global negative climate forcing (cooling) of around −0.001 to −0.002 W m−2 (long-term) or  −0.006 (short-term) W m−2, compared to less than −0.0005 W m−2 if only considering CH4 and N2O. Forcing from shifting burning later in contrast is negligible in the long term. CO2 emissions reduction through emission factor changes and burned area reduction is the largest contributing factor, though especially in the short term albedo effects are also substantial. Shifting fire activity towards the late fire season generally produces a positive climate forcing (warming) of a smaller magnitude. We find too that some localities within our study area have a potentially disproportionately large impact on our results, such that the efficacy of any fire regime change with respect to climate forcing must be carefully considered on a local scale."

We found that particle water uptake varies by season and size, with lower values in summer due to more organic materials. Local pollution mainly influences smaller particles, while larger ones are shaped by air mass transport. These findings help improve climate models and support better air pollution control in fast-growing cities. 
 Aerosol hygroscopicity plays a significant role in atmospheric chemistry, radiation, and climate effects. While previous studies have investigated regional differences in aerosol hygroscopicity, long-term observational studies focusing on seasonal variations in specific regions remain scarce. This study explores size-resolved and seasonal variations in aerosol hygroscopicity in northern Nanjing, using one-year hygroscopicity-tandem differential mobility analyser (H-TDMA) measurements in 2021. Aerosols in the region show relatively low hygroscopicity due to a high organic content (annual average mass fraction: 42.92 % in PM2.5) in fine particles. The mean hygroscopicity parameter (κmean) increases with particle size across all seasons. Particles (40–200 nm) show seasonal κmean variations: winter (0.12–0.24) and spring (0.14–0.25) display relatively higher values attributable to relatively higher secondary inorganic content, while summer (0.12–0.21) and autumn (0.10–0.20) exhibit relatively weaker hygroscopicity due to enhanced contributions from less hygroscopic components. Diurnal patterns are shaped by photochemical aging and aqueous-phase reactions, leading to κmean slight enhancement for larger particles in the afternoon and evening. New particle formation (NPF) events occur most frequently in spring. During spring NPF days, Aitken-mode particles exhibit slightly low hygroscopicity, whereas accumulation-mode particles demonstrate relatively higher hygroscopicity compared to non-NPF days. Regional transport analysis reveals distinct controlling factors: hygroscopicity of 40 nm particles may be mainly controlled by local sources, while 200 nm particles are more influenced by seasonal air mass transport. These results improve understanding of aerosol–cloud interactions and support regional climate modeling and air quality management in urbanizing areas."

Ziemba;Snorre Stamnes,Closing the gap: an algorithmic approach to reconciling in-situ and remotely sensed aerosol properties,"This study focuses on aerosol particles, which critically influence the atmosphere by scattering and absorbing light. To understand these interactions, airborne field campaigns deploy instruments that can measure these particles’ directly or indirectly via remote sensing. We introduce the In Situ Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (ISARA) to ensure consistency between aerosol measurements and show that the two data sets generally align, with some deviation caused by the presence of larger particles. 
 Remote sensing retrievals of atmospheric particle (i.e., aerosol) properties, such as those from lidars and polarimeters, are increasingly used to study aerosol effects on critical cloud and marine boundary layer processes. To ensure the reliability of these retrievals, it is important to validate them using aerosol measurements from in-situ instruments (i.e., external closure). However, achieving rigorous external closure is challenging because in-situ instruments often (1) provide dry (relative humidity (RH) < 40 %) aerosol measurements, while remote sensors typically retrieve properties in ambient conditions and (2) only sample a limited aerosol size-range due to sampling inlet cutoffs. To address these challenges, we introduce the In-Situ Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (ISARA), a methodological framework designed to enable closure between in-situ and remote sensing aerosol data by converting dry in-situ aerosol optical and microphysical properties into their humidified equivalents in ambient air. We apply ISARA to aerosol measurements collected during the NASA Aerosol Cloud meTeorology Interactions oVer the western ATlantic Experiment (ACTIVATE) field campaign to test its ability to generate aerosol properties that are physically consistent across in-situ and remote sensing platforms. To assess this performance, we conduct consistency analyses comparing ISARA-calculated intensive and extensive aerosol properties with corresponding measurements from (1) ACTIVATE's in-situ instruments (internal consistency), (2) Monte Carlo in-situ data simulations (synthetic consistency), (3) ACTIVATE's Second Generation High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL-2) and Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) instruments (external consistency). This study demonstrates that: (1) appropriate a priori assumptions for aerosol can lead to consistency between many in-situ measurements and remote sensing retrievals in the ACTIVATE campaign, (2) ambient aerosol properties retrieved from dry in-situ and the RSP polarimetric data are compared showing reasonable agreement for the first time in literature, (3)  measurements are externally consistent even in the presence of moderately absorbing (imaginary refractive index (IRI) > 0.015) and coarse nonspherical particles, and (4) ISARA is likely limited by (i) under-sampling of low background concentrations (N < 1 cm−3) for aerosol sizes greater than 5 µm in diameter as well as (ii) by an under-determined measurement system. These results suggest that additional in-situ measurements under ambient conditions, at a wider range of wavelengths, of the real refractive index, and of the coarse aerosol size distribution, can reduce the uncertainties of the in-situ ambient aerosol products. Although this study focuses on fine spherical aerosol mixtures with a coarse mode that is spherical or nonspherical (spheroidal), its success demonstrates that ISARA could have the potential to support systematic and physically consistent closure of aerosol data sets in various field campaigns and aerosol regimes."

This sampling system allows for easy and cost-effective measurements of organic aerosols at different heights and locations. By elucidating the chemical composition of organic aerosol, sources and processing of the compounds can be identified. Measurements at different altitudes and times of the day provide insight into the chemical aging and daytime trends of the aerosol particles. 
 Organic aerosols (OAs) are introduced into the atmosphere from a variety of natural and anthropogenic sources. Especially in the submicrometer range, the organic fraction contributes to a large proportion of the particle mass and thus has an impact on climate and air quality. To gain insights into sources and sinks and the significance of dispersion, mixing, and aging processes for OA, vertical profiling of the concentration of organic aerosols is particularly helpful. Therefore, the aim of this study is to present an aerosol particle sampler that is suitable to be used on board uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). The sampler consists of a three-dimensionally printed filter holder connected to a lightweight high-performance pump that can generate a flow rate of up to 103 slpm for up to 30 min. The sampler was characterized and applied on a proof-of-concept study during the BISTUM23 campaign in August 2023 in Southern Germany. Vertical profiles were measured with three samplers mounted on ground and UAVs and collected aerosol particles at an altitude of 1.5, 120, and 500 m above ground level simultaneously. The filters were analyzed with UHPLC-HRMS, and a targeted approach was used to determine vertical profiles and diurnal trends of biogenic, anthropogenic, and biomass burning marker compounds. A non-targeted analysis revealed a high number of CHO-containing compounds, which were oxidized to a greater extent during the course of the day and at increasing altitudes. The system presented here provides a comparatively simple and cost-effective way to sample OA at different altitudes and at different locations and thus obtain vertical concentration profiles of the organic aerosol composition."

The comparison of our top-down mass flux estimates (up to 3000 kg h−1) against those from bottom-up in-mine CH4 safety sensors revealed very good agreement. This approach also has a great potential in quantifying emission source strengths (down to 20 kg h−1) from a wide range of other CH4 emitters (e.g. landfills, oil & gas industry). 
 This study introduces a helicopter-borne mass balance approach, utilizing the HELiPOD platform, to accurately quantify methane (CH4) emissions from coal mining activities. Compared to conventional research aircraft, the use of an external sling load configuration eliminates the need for aeronautical certifications, facilitates easier modifications and enables local helicopter companies to conduct flights. Furthermore, it allows for plume probing as close as several hundred meters downwind of an emission source and offers comprehensive vertical coverage from 50 m to 3 km altitude, making the HELiPOD an ideal tool to distinguish, capture, and quantify emissions from single sources in complex emission landscapes worldwide. Our approach serves as an independent emission verification tool, bridging the gap between ground-based, drone, near-field and far-field airborne measurements and supports identification of CH4 emission mitigation opportunities. Nineteen mission flights were conducted in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin of Southern Poland in June and October 2022 that targeted CH4 emissions from multiple coal mine ventilation shafts and several drainage stations. The comparison of top-down HELiPOD mass flux estimates against those calculated from bottom-up in-mine CH4 safety sensor and air flow measurements revealed very good agreement with relative deviations of 0 % to 25 %. This indicates, notwithstanding associated uncertainties, that the two independent approaches are capable of estimating CH4 emissions from coal mine ventilation shafts accurately. However, the accuracy and representativeness of derived in-mine data is application-specific and should be evaluated by independent measurements.With measured CH4 emission rates up to 3000 kg h−1 from individual coal mine ventilation shafts we confirm prior research, while revealing that emission strengths from drainage stations can be of comparable magnitude and should be investigated further. The possibility to detect emissions at rates as low as 20 kg h−1 with the HELiPOD was demonstrated through a controlled release experiment. This emphasises the wide range of potential applications in quantifying sources within a wide range of CH4 emission rates, i.e. from relatively small sources, e.g. biodigesters, landfills, cattle feedlots and manure pits to larger industrial sources including those from the coal, oil and gas sectors."

 The Polar Multi-Sensor Aerosol optical properties product (PMAp) provides global Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) observations that are retrieved using a combination of measurements from instruments onboard the Metop satellites, including the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2), the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), and the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). The PMAp Climate Data Record (CDR), published in 2022, comprises data from the Metop-A and Metop-B satellites covering the period from 2007 to 2019. The PMAp also includes classification for selected aerosol types, including dust. Based on the classification, a dust-dominated total AOD can be extracted. The focus of this work is to assess the dust aerosols in the PMAp CDRs, by analysing the spatio-temporal occurrence of dust and aerosol classification reliability, as well as by carrying out dust-dominated total AOD validation against AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) observations. Our results show that the occurrence and classification of PMAp dust-dominated AOD agrees well with AERONET metrics. For PMAp dust-dominated total AODs, moderate to strong correlations with AERONET (0.45–0.8) are observed, while mean biases exhibit relatively high variability. The root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) typically represent 50 %–80 % of the mean AERONET AOD conditions. As most of the comparisons here occur at relatively high AOD levels over bright land surfaces, where measurement uncertainties and variability are inherently greater, this is somewhat expected. The results also bring up certain challenges, e.g. PMAp AOD overestimation at Central Asian AERONET stations or occasional occurrences of dust-dominated total AODs that appeared as clear outliers in AERONET comparisons. Further investigation is needed to determine their underlying causes. On a larger spatial scale, The PMAp CDRs can capture the expected seasonal variation in dust-affected AODs, such as over the Saharan outflow area, but sampling density can vary across seasons, especially over land. Therefore, full AOD distributions, along with median and mean, should be analyzed to ensure accurate conclusions. Despite challenges, the PMAp CDRs show potential for monitoring global dust aerosol patterns."

The Ice Cloud Imager (ICI) will measure at microwave and sub-millimetre frequencies, which are well suited to detect atmospheric ice. In this study, a machine learning model is trained on ICI simulations. Results show that the vertical distribution of ice can be derived from ICI observations, and that ICI could offer a valuable data source that complements existing radar- and lidar-based measurements. 
 The Ice Cloud Imager (ICI) will be hosted on the second generation of the EUMETSAT Polar System (EPS-SG). By measuring at microwave and sub-millimetre wavelengths, ICI will provide unparalleled global observations of ice clouds. EUMETSAT's official ICI level-2 product will offer retrievals of ice mass column properties. This study explores whether the capabilities of ICI can be extended to retrieve vertical profiles of ice mass.Using a retrieval database of ICI simulations, we trained a quantile regression neural network (QRNN) to retrieve ice water content (IWC) and profiles of the mean mass diameter of ice hydrometeors. Our retrieval setup is fast and simpler to implement than previous ICI profile retrieval approaches, and the study is more comprehensive in scope than earlier efforts. Comparisons between our retrieved and database profiles demonstrate that ICI observations are sensitive to IWC within the range of 10−2 and 1 g m−3, and performance is strongest between altitudes of 3 and 14 km. Our results also show that ICI observations are sensitive to mean mass diameter values up to 600 µm, although successful retrievals of up to 800 µm are observed. To assess the vertical resolution of the retrievals, we computed approximations of averaging kernels on the model predictions. We estimate the resolution of IWC profiles to be ∼ 2.5 km. Retrievals of mean mass diameter achieve an estimated resolution of 2.5 km at an altitude of 5 km, with reduced resolution at higher altitudes.No operational product currently provides ice mass vertical information derived from passive microwave observations. However, this study demonstrates that ICI can fill this gap thanks to the presence of both microwave and sub-millimetre channels, with the sub-millimetre wavelengths providing particularly high sensitivity to cloud ice. Furthermore, the relatively broad swath of ICI observations lead to a higher spatial and temporal coverage than radar and lidar products can achieve. The global and long-term dataset that ICI will offer could therefore act as a valuable complement to CloudSat or EarthCARE-based retrievals. Future efforts could explore the inclusion of the Microwave Imager (MWI) observations to improve retrievals at low altitudes – a natural next step given that MWI is to be launched on the same platform as ICI."

We adapted an existing instrument, Rapid-E, using Laser-Induced Fluorescence and machine learning, for rapid, field-deployable bacterial identification. Our system successfully detected bacteria and showed promise in distinguishing various species. This faster approach improves environmental monitoring and helps safeguard public health by quickly spotting potential microbial threats in the air. 
 Microorganisms are ubiquitous in the environment, playing key roles in all ecosystems, including the atmosphere, with airborne dissemination via particulate matter being essential for many microorganisms' life cycles. However, the atmosphere as a microbial ecosystem has been severely understudied, mostly due to the challenging technical difficulties in sampling and characterizing it and the presumed irrelevance of the atmospheric environment for microbes. So far, most recent studies use metagenomic sequencing to assess aerobiome diversity, which can be biased and hurdled due to the inherent ultra-low DNA yield of air samples. Previous research has already demonstrated the potential use of Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) and machine learning (ML) to characterize the vegetal fraction of bioaerosols, by classifying pollen particles using the Rapid-E bioaerosol detector (Plair SA) and neural network classifiers. In this study, we present a new methodology for near real-time (NRT) automatic recognition of microbial particles in the air: first by replacing Rapid-E's visible and ultraviolet (UV) laser (337 nm) with another laser (266 nm) optimized to excite fluorophores in bacterial and fungal cell membranes. We tested this new setup with artificially generated aerosols enriched with five distinct bacterial species. Employing Random Forest classifiers, we were able to: (a) detect bacterial particles (96.74 % class-balanced accuracy), and (b)  discriminate between the different species (69.24 % class-balanced accuracy across the different species in the validation set). This innovative approach sets a new range of possibilities for the rapid and precise monitoring of airborne microbial communities, offering a valuable tool for both ecological studies and public health surveillance."

Harper;Callum E. Flowerday;Zachary Giauque;Kaitlyn Brewster;Ryan Thalman;Jaron C. Hansen,High-purity nitrous acid (HONO) generation and quantification using broadband cavity-enhanced  absorption spectroscopy (BBCEAS),"In this study, we developed a new way to produce and measure nitrous acid, an important atmospheric gas that can be difficult to synthesize. By carefully controlling temperatures and reaction conditions, we created high-purity (<96 %) samples and showed how they can be stored and released when needed. This advance makes it easier to study how nitrous acid contributes to air pollution and atmospheric interactions, while also improving tools for laboratory experiments and instrument testing. 
 Nitrous acid (HONO) is a key atmospheric precursor to hydroxyl radicals (OH), which drive oxidation processes in the troposphere. Accurate quantification of HONO is essential for modelling atmospheric chemistry but is often challenging due to low ambient concentrations, significant wall losses from instruments with inlets, and interference from co-produced nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Laboratory generation methods frequently struggle to produce HONO in both high purity and usable quantities. This study introduces a simple, scalable method for generating high-purity HONO relative to NO2 via the reaction of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium nitrite (NaNO2) in a multi-bubbler system. The method incorporates a thermal “catch and release” mechanism to selectively trap HONO and separate it from NO2 prior to analysis. While the melting point of NO2 is well-established at −9 °C, the melting point of HONO was monitored and determined to be −4 °C, enabling the thermal separation mechanism to function effectively. Broadband cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy (BBCEAS) was used for detection and quantification in the 329–344 nm region. Systematic optimization of bubbler temperatures, carrier gas flow rates, capture durations, and moisture levels yielded HONO purities greater than 96 %. This method enables reliable and flexible production of high-purity HONO relative to NO2, making it well-suited for use in laboratory-based chamber studies and instrument calibration applications."

Atmospheric measurements are essential to verify that these efforts lead to the expected reductions. Here, we characterise and compare 96 European cities across 18 metrics, linking them to four major challenges in CO2 emissions monitoring. Our framework includes a tool with additional cities and metrics, as well as ""mapbooks"" for the 96 cities. 
 For the development of a joint European capacity for monitoring CO2 emissions, we created the framework “CO2 Monitoring Challenges City Mapbooks v1.0” (CMC-CITYMAP). It includes a Jupyter notebook tool (Storm et al., 2025a,  https://doi.org/10.18160/P8SV-B99F) which we use to characterise and cluster cities based on aspects relevant for different CO2 monitoring challenges. These include: a.
determining background levels of CO2 inflow into a city (“background challenge”).b.
separating the anthropogenic emissions from the influence of the biosphere (“biogenic challenge”).c.
representing spatially and temporally non-uniform emissions in models (“modelling challenge”).d.
implementing observation strategies not covered by the other challenges (“application-specific observational challenge”). We provide and discuss the challenges on a city-by-city basis. Our primary focus, however, is on the relationships between cities: best practices and lessons learned from monitoring CO2 emissions in one city can be transferred to other cities with similar characteristics. Additionally, we identify cities with characteristics that strongly contrast with those of cities with existing urban monitoring systems.While the notebook tool includes 308 cities, this paper focuses on the results for 96 cities with more than 200 000 inhabitants. We place a particular emphasis on Paris, Munich, and Zurich. These cities are pilot cities for the Horizon 2020-funded project Pilot Application in Urban Landscapes (“ICOS Cities”), where a range of urban CO2 monitoring methods are being implemented and assessed. According to our analyses, Zurich – and Munich especially – should be less challenging to monitor than Paris. Examining the challenges individually reveals that the most significant challenge relative to the other cities is the “modelling challenge” (c) for Zurich and Paris. Complex urban topography adds to the challenge for both cities, and in Zurich, the natural topography further amplifies the challenge. Munich has low scores across all challenges, but with the greatest challenge anticipated from the “application-specific observational challenge” (d). Overall, Bratislava (Slovakia) and Copenhagen (Denmark) are among the most distant from Paris, Munich, and Zurich in our dendrogram resulting from numerical cluster-analysis. This makes them strong candidates for inclusion in the ICOS Cities network, as they would potentially provide the most information on how to monitor emissions in cities that face different challenges."

 Hygroscopic growth of aerosols significantly affects radiative forcing and visibility, yet remains challenging due to the interplay among size, composition, and humidity. This study integrates in-situ PM and lidar data to address discrepancies between dry mass concentrations and wet optical measurements. Using machine learning inversion (XGBoost, R2 = 0.98), dry-state size distributions were retrieved from PM data. Mie theory was applied to derive the dry extinction coefficient, and the lidar-based wet extinction coefficient yielded the hygroscopic growth. Aerosol types were classified using Random Forest (accuracy 83.4%), revealing dominance of coarse hygroscopic aerosols in this coastal urban region. Optical response varied with hygroscopicity: wet extinction coefficient increased with RH for hydrophilic types but remained low for hydrophobic aerosols. Notably, clean conditions occasionally showed a sharp increase in wet extinction coefficient despite low PM, highlighting limitations of mass-only assessments. This approach suggests improved aerosol characterization algorithms considering size and hygroscopicity, supporting advanced air quality and climate modeling studies."

Rodger;Mark Weber,Quantifying the contribution of transport to Antarctic springtime ozone column variability,"We use observational data to track a mass of mesospheric air which descends into the Antarctic polar vortex each spring. The altitude of the air mass at the end of October is used to create a new diagnostic metric. The metric captures the dynamical conditions of the vortex and can be used to estimate the amount of poleward ozone transport in October. When used as a proxy for October polar total column ozone, the metric explains the majority (63%) of the observed variance from 2004–2024. 
 Quantifying chemical and dynamical drivers of Antarctic ozone variability remains important as stratospheric chlorine levels gradually reduce and the ozone hole recovers in response. While chemistry dominates the formation of the ozone hole in September, the role of dynamics grows as the spring season progresses. To improve our ability to characterise the dynamical impacts on Antarctic total column ozone (TCO), we use MLS/Aura observations of carbon monoxide to trace the path of an air parcel that originates in the mesosphere and descends into the springtime polar vortex. We define a new metric, the Mesospheric Parcel Altitude (MPA), which measures the altitude of the descending mesospheric air parcel at the end of October. The MPA is highly correlated with October TCO and functions as a diagnostic tool, capturing the dynamical state of the inner-vortex. Based on the MPA, we classify October ozone holes from 2004–2024 into three mesospheric descent types (Strong, Regular, and Weak) and provide a formula to estimate the magnitude of horizontal ozone transport (poleward of 70° S and between 17–27 km) during a given October. A higher MPA (>26.9 km) indicates Weak descent, reduced ozone transport, and a larger, longer-lived ozone hole. A lower MPA (<24.6 km) indicates Strong descent, increased ozone transport, and a smaller, shorter-lived ozone hole. When the MPA is used as a proxy for polar cap TCO, approximately 63 % of the observed variance during October is explained by the metric."

Wooster;Haofan Wang;Fei Yao;Liang Feng;Kai Wu;Xiao Lu;Shaojia Fan,Using geostationary-satellite-derived sub-daily fire radiative power variability versus prescribed diurnal cycles to assess the impact of African fires on tropospheric ozone,"We examine the impact of diurnally varying African biomass burning (BB) emissions on tropospheric ozone using GEOS-Chem simulations with a high-resolution satellite-derived emission inventory. Compared to coarser temporal resolutions, incorporating diurnal variations leads to significant changes in surface ozone and atmospheric oxidation capacity. Our findings highlight the importance of accurately representing BB emission timing in chemical transport models to improve ozone predictions. 
 Assessing the impact of biomass burning (BB) emissions on tropospheric ozone is critical for understanding air pollution and climate interactions. BB emission inventories like Global Fire Emissions Database and Global Fire Assimilation System, typically based on sun-synchronous satellite observations, report emissions on daily, weekly or longer timescales with empirically derived factors generally used to overlay diurnal variations. To explore the sensitivity of tropospheric ozone to diurnal variability, we incorporated day-specific hourly BB variations inferred from geostationary satellite data into the GEOS-Chem atmospheric chemistry transport model. The simulations were compared with those using established inventories and evaluated against in situ and satellite observations. Simulations with real hourly-resolved emissions produce comparable surface ozone biases (−1.54 to +9.09 ppbv vs. −1.58 to +9.13 ppbv) and marginally higher correlations with TROPOMI nitrogen dioxide (r=0.80–0.89) and OMI ozone (r=0.80–0.94). Although the statistical improvements are limited, the geostationary-driven approach reveals pronounced regional ozone differences and mechanistic insights into the role of diurnal fire variability. Data-driven diurnal BB variations across Africa cause significant surface ozone changes (−8.57 to +21.88 ppbv) and alter tropospheric ozone columns by −0.41 to 1.09 DU, particularly in regions with intense fire activity like Angola and Zambia. These changes propagate globally, shifting regional OH concentrations by −4.4 % to +51.7 %. These findings emphasize the critical role of accurately describing diurnal BB variations in atmospheric models to better quantify its impacts on atmospheric composition, providing insights for Earth system model development and the use of geostationary-derived BB emissions datasets."

Cloud responses to aerosols differed significantly across meteorological regimes. The model captured overall trends but exaggerated cloud responses, performing better for shallower than deeper clouds. The results highlight the need to untangle aerosol effects from meteorology and improve cloud process representation in climate models. 
 This study investigates aerosol-cloud interactions in marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds using an advanced deep-learning-driven synoptic-regime-based framework, combining satellite data (CALIPSO vertically resolved aerosol extinction and MODIS cloud properties) with 1° nudged Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 2 (E3SMv2) simulation over the Eastern North Atlantic (ENA; ∼10°×10°, 2006–2014). The E3SMv2 captures observed seasonal variations in cloud droplet number concentrations (Nd) and liquid water path (LWP), though it systematically underestimates Nd. We then partition ENA meteorology into four synoptic regimes (Pre-Trough, Post-Trough, Ridge, Trough) via a deep-learning clustering of ERA5 reanalysis fields, enabling regime-dependent aerosol-cloud interactions analyses. Both satellite and E3SMv2 exhibit an inverted-V LWP-Nd relationship. In Post-Trough and Ridge regimes, the satellite shows stronger negative LWP-Nd sensitivities than in Pre-Trough regime. The Trough regime displays a muted satellite LWP response. In comparison, the model predicts more exaggerated LWP responses across regimes, with LWP increasing too quickly at low Nd and decreasing more sharply at high Nd, especially in Pre-Trough and Trough regimes. These exaggerated model LWP sensitivities may stem from uncertainties in representing drizzle processes, entrainment, and turbulent mixing. As for Nd susceptibility to aerosols, Nd increases with MBL aerosol extinction in both datasets, but the simulated aerosol-cloud interactions appear oversensitive to meteorological conditions. Overall, E3SMv2 better captures aerosol effects under regimes that favor stratiform clouds (Post-Trough, Ridge), but performance deteriorates for regimes with deeper, dynamically complex clouds (Trough), highlighting the need for improved representations of those cloud processes in climate models."

These findings deepen the mechanistic understanding of aerosol phase transitions at the molecular scale, which could inspire new research directions in atmospheric heterogeneous chemistry. 
 Phase transitions of particles are importance because it could influence reactive gas uptake, multiphase chemical reactions pathways, ice and polar stratospheric cloud formation. Electron microscopy-based techniques detect phase transitions through macroscopic properties but cannot resolve efflorescence kinetics at the molecular level, whereas spectroscopic methods, while enabling molecular-level tracking of aerosol transformations and water uptake quantification, remain limited in characterizing the dynamics of efflorescence phase transition due to insufficient temporal resolution to resolve intermolecular interactions and capture complex intermediate states. In this study, the efflorescence phase transition of AS aerosol is tracked by using the fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic technique. A novel method has been developed that not only accurately determines the phase transition region but also enables the identification of micro-dynamic phase transition processes through analysis of the molecular structural change sequence based on two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy. During efflorescence transition processes, we measured the phase transition point at 39 ± 0.8 % (RH), and its start and end points at 41 ± 0.8 % (RH) and 36 ± 0.8 % (RH), respectively. We further identified four distinct micro-dynamics steps during the efflorescence processes. Initially, there was a gradual loss of liquid water for the solution droplets. Subsequently, it formed the supersaturated ammonium sulfate (AS) aerosols. Furthermore, hydrogen bonds between liquid water and sulfate dissociate, reducing aqueous sulfate concentration. The replacement of H2O by NH4+ in the sulfate hydration shell drives a bond reorganization that strengthens sulfate-ammonium interactions at the expense of original sulfate-water bonds. The efflorescence occurs and forms crystal/solid AS. Eventually, the remaining liquid water molecules eventually detach from the AS system, completing the liquid-to-solid phase transition. This method will help improve comprehending of the transport and deposition of inhaled aerosol.  Moreover, these insights will spur fundamental research into the formation, transformation and nucleation mechanisms of atmospheric aerosols."

The former is used to generate the analysis, the latter to verify the simulations. A preprocessor classifying the observations by the data characteristics is developed based on clustering algorithms. The assimilation and validation data sets are compiled by equally allocating data of each cluster. The resulting improvement of the analysis is evaluated with an air quality model. 
 In the field of air quality analysis, data assimilation is commonly used to integrate information on the atmospheric state provided by observations into the model. However, the analysis is largely dependent on the data available to the assimilation system. In order to obtain an accurate analysis of the true state of the atmosphere, the representativity of the utilized data becomes a fundamental requirement. Here, a method is presented that derives a representative split of the ground-based monitoring network data that depends only on the characteristics of the observation data. The core of the methods is a clustering algorithm to subdivide the data into subsets. Two clustering algorithms, k-means, and k-mean soft constraint, are tested and applied to air pollutant observations in Europe. The clusters are solely derived from observation intrinsic properties (such as geographic location and averaged concentrations). The resulting clusters reliably distinguish common features of the observational data, e.g. mean and variance of averaged air pollutant concentrations. Representativity of the observational data in the assimilation and validation subset is ensured by sampling each cluster individually. The method is tested using the assimilation system of the chemistry transport model EURAD-IM (EURopean Air pollution Dispersion – Inverse Model) and evaluated for data from four months in 2016. A significant improvement of the analysis' representativity, quantified by the difference between the analysis' root mean square error with respect to the assimilation and validation dataset, is found in the results. Compared to an operational configuration, the largest improvement in the relative representativity measure is evaluated for CO with 16 %, for NO2 with 4 %, and for O3 with 1 %.

 Irrigation modifies land-atmosphere interactions, cooling land surface and mitigating heat extremes. However, the global shift toward water-saving irrigation technologies raises new questions about the climate regulation capacity of irrigation under constrained water use. Using two decades of high-resolution satellite observations across China, we show that widespread water-saving adoption has substantially weakened irrigation’s biophysical cooling effects, particularly in late summer and early spring. Daytime land surface cooling declined by 0.05 K/decade (15%) nationally and up to 0.20 K/decade (9%) in arid regions, primarily due to reduced soil evaporation and increased sensible heat flux. This trend was absent in semi-arid and semi-humid regions because of enhanced crop transpiration. Conversely, nighttime cooling intensified by 0.04 K per decade, likely driven by lower soil thermal capacity and radiative feedbacks. These findings reveal an emerging trade-off between water-use efficiency and climate mitigation, calling for considering evolving irrigation practices in Earth system models and climate change projections. Water-saving irrigation weakens daytime cooling and enhances nighttime cooling across China; satellite and surface energy balance analyses (2001–2020) link this to reduced soil evaporation, increased sensible heat, and altered land–atmosphere interactions."

Kay;Bin Guan;Jiang Zhu,Water sources and land capacitor effects stimulate observed summer Arctic moistening and warming,"Trends in boreal summer large scale circulation have been a key factor in the moistening of the Arctic over recent decades, according to analyses of Earth system model simulations. 
 The primary sources of recent summer Arctic moistening trends in reanalysis are uncertain, hindering attribution of observed Arctic warming due to radiative effects from water vapor changes. Here, we use a combined online numerical water tracer and circulation nudging approach in the Community Earth System Model to track the sources of water vapor beyond its initial sources. Trends in boreal summer large-scale circulation have driven moistening of the Arctic over recent decades, having a large impact on the Arctic radiative budget, accounting for 94% of the strengthening water vapor radiative feedback. We identify two key regions supplying the Arctic water vapor feedback: Northeast North America and western/central Eurasia. In both regions, anticyclonic circulations over the southwest Atlantic and eastern Europe move moisture from the tropical oceans poleward to high latitude land through precipitation in winter and spring. During summer, evapotranspiration over land releases this water vapor, and it is transported by winds into the Arctic. We refer to this sequence of terrestrial moisture storage and release as the land capacitor effect. Thus, the impacts of circulation changes on poleward moisture transport and land-atmosphere interactions over high latitudes represent the underlying mechanisms of the recent moistening and warming in the Arctic. Trends in boreal summer large scale circulation have been a key factor in the moistening of the Arctic over recent decades, according to analyses of Earth system model simulations."

However, the specific role of regional transport in this improvement remains unclear. Here, we investigated the drivers of PM2.5 mitigation in the BTHSA and systematically quantified the contribution of regional transport during 2013–2020, by conducting multi-scenario analysis using a combination of a bottom–up emission inventory and a chemical transport model with an embedded source apportionment module. The simulated regional average PM2.5 concentration across the BTHSA declined by 56.1% from 2013 to 2020, primarily driven by anthropogenic emission control (78.1%), while the remaining 21.9% explained by meteorological variability. Within the anthropogenic impacts, reductions in local emissions, intra-regional transport, and extra-regional transport accounted for 49.0%, 32.9%, and 18.1%, respectively. Nevertheless, the relative importance of these drivers shifted, with local contributions declining while regional transport influences intensified and surpassed local abatement in Phase II, where intra-regional transport remained dominant, but the influence of extra-regional transport rose markedly to 1.4 times its Phase I level. Spatially, emission reductions in Hebei and Shandong contributed the most to the regional PM2.5 decline, representing over 50% of the transport-related improvement. Trends in regional contributions to Beijing, the core city of the BTHSA region, suggest the need for dynamically adjusting joint control policies, expanding coordinated mitigation efforts to extra-regional cities in Southern Shandong, as well as to key regions like the Yangtze River Delta. These findings underscore the growing importance of regional transport in air quality improvement and support more adaptive regional collaboration strategies moving forward."

However, several studies have reported that wildfires can also reduce the concentrations of certain gaseous species. This study investigated the impacts of smoke plumes from wildfires that occurred in late July 2014 in Siberia, Russia, on downwind gaseous pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and ozone (O3). The Community Multi-scale Air Quality model was employed for air quality simulations, and wildfire emissions were obtained from the Fire INventory from the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Wildfire-induced CO, VOCs, and O3 were transported to Northeast China (NEC), the Yellow Sea (YS), and the Korean Peninsula (KP), resulting in elevated pollutant levels in these downwind regions. Interestingly, despite the transport of plumes, surface-level NOx concentrations over NEC, YS, and KP even decreased. Such reductions were not evident near the Siberian source areas but became apparent after the plumes reached the NEC region. In these regions, NO was converted through reactions with wildfire-induced VOCs (84.54%) and NO3 radicals (13.18%), while NO2 was primarily transformed into NO3 radicals via reactions with O3 (90.08%) or into organic nitrates through reactions with VOCs (9.92%). We found that the observed conversions in NOx concentrations were attributable to anthropogenic sources, as the conversion patterns varied depending on the level of anthropogenic NOx emissions in the sensitivity experiments. These results suggest that wildfire-driven NOx concentration changes in downwind regions cannot be fully explained by wildfire emissions alone. This study underscores the importance of accurately characterizing anthropogenic emission sources in regions affected by smoke plume transport to predict changes in gaseous pollutant concentrations following wildfire events. We expect that this study will enhance future wildfire-related research by improving the prediction of the spatial distribution and atmospheric behavior of gaseous pollutants."

This update addresses a large low bias of -80 % in simulated NO2 nocturnal deposition velocities evaluated against long-term eddy covariance flux observations over Harvard Forest. We highlight the importance of canopy surface area effects as well as soil NO emissions in formulating and evaluating NO2 dry-deposition parameterizations. 
 Dry deposition is a major loss pathway for reactive nitrogen species from the atmospheric boundary layer. We evaluate isolated components of the parameterization for species-specific gaseous dry-deposition velocity Vd(x) for HNO3 and NO2 from the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model by running a stand-alone version of Vd code in single-point mode to enable a more direct comparison to field observations. Improved measurement–model agreement results mainly from (i) updates to the calculation of molecular diffusivities and (ii) the representation of ground surface NO2 hydrolysis in the formulation of non-stomatal uptake. We evaluate the parameterization for non-stomatal dry deposition of NO2 by comparing to eddy-covariance-inferred nocturnal Vd(NO2) over Harvard Forest. We address a large low bias (−80 %) in simulated nocturnal Vd(NO2) by representing NO2 heterogeneous hydrolysis on deposition surfaces, paying attention to chemical flux divergence, soil NO emission, and canopy surface area effects. Finally, we evaluate the updated oxidized reactive nitrogen (NOy) dry-deposition parameterization by comparing to eddy-covariance-inferred Vd(NOy) over Harvard Forest, finding that a modest nocturnal low bias (−19 %) remains in simulated Vd(NOy) due to the compensating effects of updates to the calculation of molecular diffusivities (28 % reduction in nocturnal Vd(NOy)) and the representation of NO2 heterogeneous hydrolysis (25 % increase in nocturnal Vd(NOy)). These developments are a first step towards a tractable representation of NO2 hydrolysis in a dry-deposition scheme and have important implications for the near-surface NO2 lifetime through a mechanism involving HONO emission."

We use temperature data to see them from a satellite, and here have made a new method to automatically detect them. This works by seeing if points next to each other are from the same wave. This is useful for creating larger gravity wave datasets without noise, which can then be used by climate forecasters to improve their understanding of the atmosphere. 
 Atmospheric gravity waves (GWs) are an important mechanism for vertical transport of energy and momentum through the atmosphere. Their impacts are apparent at all scales, including aviation, weather, and climate. Identifying stratospheric GWs from satellite observations is challenging due to instrument noise and effects of weather processes, but they can be observed from nadir sounders such as the AIRS instrument onboard Aqua. Here, a new method (hereafter “neighbourhood method”) to detect GW information is presented and applied to AIRS data. This uses a variant of the 3D S-transform to calculate the horizontal wavenumbers of temperature perturbations, then find areas of spatially constant horizontal wavenumbers (assumed to be GWs), which allow for creating a binary wave-presence mask. We describe the concept of the neighbourhood method and use it to investigate GW amplitudes, zonal pseudomomentum fluxes, and vertical wavelengths over 5 years of AIRS data. We compare these results to those calculated from GWs detected using another widely used method based on an amplitude cutoff. 35 % of regions of wave activity detected using the neighbourhood method have amplitudes lower than is visible using the amplitude cutoff method. Three regions are studied in greater depth: the Rocky Mountains, North Africa, and New Zealand/Tasmania. GWs detected using the neighbourhood method have wave phase propagation angles consistent with linear theory. Using the neighbourhood method produces new statistics for regional and global GW studies, which compare favourably to the amplitude cutoff GW detection method."

Nitrate levels peak near the ground in spring/winter due to humidity and temperature, while wind and sunlight drive high-altitude pollution in late autumn. Winter shows unique daytime peaks linked to sunlight and nighttime chemistry. Findings help cities design targeted strategies, like timing emissions cuts, to improve air quality by addressing pollution at specific heights and times. 
 The vertical distribution of particulate nitrate is crucial for understanding its formation mechanisms and developing urban haze reduction strategies. Advanced technologies were used in this study to collect continuous vertical data on nitrate concentrations in Beijing for 2021, providing a seasonal analysis of their distribution and influencing factors. Spring exhibited the highest nitrate concentration below 2 km (8.29 ± 3.14 µg m−3), followed by winter (7.34 ± 2.78 µg m−3), autumn (6.65 ± 2.11 µg m−3), and summer (2.23 ± 0.82 µg m−3). Below 300 m, thermodynamic factors dominated nitrate formation in spring and summer (RH: R = 0.64; temperature: R = −0.76), whereas winter formation was driven by both atmospheric oxidizing capacity (AOC, R = 0.52) and thermodynamic factors (R = 0.68). Between 0.8 and 2 km, dynamic drivers prevailed in spring and autumn (TKE: R = −0.41; vertical wind speed: R = −0.43), while photochemical factors dominated in winter and summer (AOC: R = 0.58; O3: R = 0.60). High nitrate levels were observed at the boundary layer top (0.7–1.2 km), peaking at 118.11 µg m−3 in late autumn, closely linked to photochemical processes and dynamic drivers. In winter, nitrate concentrations exhibited distinct diurnal variations, peaking at 13:00, 18:00, and 22:00 LST, with variations and peak concentrations increasing with altitude due to the accumulation of photochemical products and enhanced AOC at night. These findings support targeted emission controls by reducing photochemical precursor emissions at the boundary layer top and strengthening NOx reductions at major sources."

Emerging evidence highlights the vital role of vertical pollutant transport in influencing surface air quality. In this study, we summarized the vertical profiles of key pollutants based on aircraft surveys up to 4000 m. The influence of regional transport on the vertical distribution patterns was analyzed, offering essential data for evaluating the impact of aloft pollutants on surface air quality. 
 The vertical distribution of reactive trace gases can greatly help understand the complex atmospheric evolution under the joint impacts of surface emission, chemical removal, and regional transport. Focusing on the core area of the North China Plain, aircraft-based observations were conducted in September 2017 and July 2019 to reveal the vertical distributions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured by high-time resolution mass spectrometry. Generally decreasing trends of VOC concentrations with altitudes were captured, indicating strong surface source emissions and chemical removal within the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Ethanol exhibited the highest concentration within the PBL with an average of 46.7 ppbv and the largest ratio (16.5) between the average below and above the PBL heights. The vertical-averaged VOCs above Baoding were greater than those in Beijing by factors ranging from 1.2 to 3.5, suggesting richer precursors for secondary pollutant formation in Baoding. Increases of several VOC species, including styrene and acetonitrile, at high altitudes (>2500 m) were captured in Beijing. Correlation analysis further revealed the significant influences of industrial and biomass burning emissions. Our results highlight the critical role of both local emissions and regional transport in shaping the VOC vertical distributions, which may affect atmospheric organic chemistry across various atmospheric layers in the region."

However, our understanding is limited due to insufficient measurements, especially for oxygenated VOCs. This study combines land, ship, and satellite data in Hong Kong, showing that oxygenated VOCs make up a significant portion of total VOCs. Despite their importance, many are underestimated in current models. These findings highlight the need to improve VOC representation in models to enhance air quality management. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a diverse group of species that contribute to ozone formation. However, our understanding of VOC dynamics and their effect on ozone pollution is limited by the lack of long-term, continuous, and speciated measurements, especially of oxygenated compounds. To address this gap, this study integrates on-land, shipborne, and spaceborne measurements from a field campaign in Hong Kong during 2021–2022, analyzing 45–98 VOC species over land and water. Results show that oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) account for 73 % (37 ppbv) of the total VOC concentration and 56 % of the total ozone formation potential (OFP), underscoring their indispensable role in VOC chemistry. Despite such importance, OVOCs are underestimated by 45 %–70 % in the CMAQ model, while non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) face a lesser underestimation of 47 %–48 % (i.e., “model underestimation”). Meanwhile, the model does not currently account for 17–56 species of the total measured VOCs (i.e., “model omission”). According to this, we break down the observed overwater VOC concentration of 51 ppbv into three components: 9 ppbv (18 %) successfully represented, 35 ppbv (69 %) underestimated, and 7 ppbv (14 %) omitted in the model. For OFP, the breakdown shows 26 % successful representation, 54 % underestimation, and 20 % omission. Together, both “omission” and “underestimation” reveal the overall “VOC underrepresentation” in the model, which partly results in greater ozone sensitivity to VOCs than observed by spaceborne TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) in polluted areas. The findings provide valuable insights into regional pollution dynamics, and inform VOC-related model development and air quality management."

Bowen;Siteng Fan;Yang Su;Hongxi Pang;Laurent Z. X. Li,Correcting for water vapor diffusion in air bag samples for isotope composition analysis: case study with drone-collected samples,"We developed and validated a model to correct for water vapor diffusion in sampling bags, enabling reconstruction of the original isotopic composition. We quantified all major sources of error and their uncertainties and introduced permeability experiments as a necessary step before field sampling. This study improves the accuracy, reliability, and standardization of atmospheric isotope observations using air bags. 
 Mass spectrometry and laser spectroscopy have been widely employed for precise water vapor isotope measurements. Nevertheless, these techniques are limited by logistical challenges in fieldwork, consequently constraining the temporal and spatial resolution of measurements. Specifically, water vapor isotope measurements are primarily limited to near-surface levels, while measurements in the free troposphere are notably scarce. Portable sampling devices, such as air bags and glass bottles, have therefore become necessary alternatives for collecting, storing, and transporting gaseous samples in diverse environments prior to analysis with less portable instruments. In drone-based high-altitude vapor sampling, air bags are preferred for their lighter weight and greater flexibility compared to glass bottles. Nevertheless, they present specific challenges, such as potential sample contamination and isotopic fractionation during storage, primarily due to the inherent permeability of air bags. Here, we developed a theoretical model for water vapor diffusion through the sampling bag surface, with parameters calibrated through laboratory experiments. This model enables the reconstruction of the initial isotopic composition of sampled vapor based on measurements obtained within the bag and from the surrounding environment. This diffusion model underwent rigorous validation through experiments conducted under varying humidity and isotopic composition differences between the inside and outside of the air bag, confirming its reliability. We applied this correction method to air samples collected at various pressures up to the upper troposphere using an air bag-mounted drone that we developed, thereby estimating the initial isotopic composition and uncertainty based on our observations. Our correction method enhances the reliability and applicability of water vapor isotope observations conducted using drones equipped with air bags, and provides a detailed assessment of all potential sources of error and quantifies the uncertainty range of the observations. This approach leverages the strengths of drone-based air bag sampling while mitigating its limitations, thus facilitating the convenient collection of isotopic data throughout the troposphere."

It aims to improve understanding of interactions between water vapor and clouds to enhance models. Integrated into the C3IEL space mission planned for 2028, it uses a Bayesian method and shows good accuracy, except for thin or low clouds. 
 A retrieval algorithm of integrated water vapor content above cloud, using shortwave infrared observations, is developed and evaluated through idealized and realistic atmospheric profiles, with its application currently limited to oceanic regions and latitudes within ±60°. Water vapor plays a crucial role in cloud formation and development, particularly in the formation of clouds resulting from convective processes. The resulting convective cloud locally influences the spatio-temporal variability of atmospheric water vapor content, through exchanges between cloud and its immediate environment. Therefore, a better understanding of the water vapor content above and around clouds is necessary to improve our comprehension of interactions between water vapor and cloud to better constrain Large-Eddy Simulations and numerical weather forecasting models. The algorithm was developed for the Cluster for Cloud evolution, ClImatE and Lightning space mission project. This mission, scheduled for 2028, aims to enhance our knowledge of the 3D convective cloud development velocities, the electrical activity associated with convective systems, and the water vapor content above and around the cloud. The retrieval algorithm presented in this study uses a Bayesian probabilistic approach, the optimal estimation method. The atmosphere is assumed to be composed of homogeneous plane-parallel layers, and synthetic radiance datasets were generated to test the developed retrieval algorithm. The feasibility of retrieving the integrated water vapor content above the cloud over the ocean from shortwave infrared radiances is shown to have, under idealized vertically homogeneous cloud profiles, absolute errors less than 2 kg m−2 for optically thick clouds or when the integrated water vapor content is below 20 kg m−2 and less than 1 kg m−2 for very thick clouds with an optical thickness exceeding 150. Tests using realistic water vapor and cloud extinction profiles that present non-homogeneous vertical distributions show that integrated water vapor content above water type clouds could be retrieved with a Root-Mean-Square Error related to cloud vertical penetration of approximately less than 1 kg m−2 except for optically thin and low-level clouds (cloud optical thickness less than 50 and cloud top height less than 2 km). For very low water vapor content encountered in the presence of high deep convective clouds, the retrieval algorithm tends to systematically overestimate the retrieved water vapor content due to an overestimation of the cloud extinction profile in the upper part of the cloud in the inversion model."

Jensen;Xiang'ao Xia;Yves-Marie Saint-Drenan;Christian A. Gueymard;Martin János Mayer;Yanbo Shen,Validating physical and semi-empirical satellite-based irradiance retrievals using high- and low-accuracy radiometric observations in a monsoon-influenced continental climate,"We tested two satellite-based irradiance datasets against both high- and low-accuracy ground-based measurements. The dataset is unique: it includes irradiance measurements from a new research-grade monitoring station in a rare climate, along with new satellite data from China's Fengyun-4B geostationary satellite. Findings suggest that using low-accuracy measurements as a reference for validation can be risky. 
 Are high-accuracy radiometric observations strictly indispensable for the validation of satellite-based irradiance retrievals, or might low-accuracy observations serve as adequate substitutes? Owing to the scarcity of sites with redundant radiometers, such inquiries have seldom been contemplated, much less subjected to systematic examination; rather, it has been customary to employ all accessible observations during validation, frequently with only minimal quality control. In this investigation, we address this question by validating two distinct sets of satellite-retrieved irradiance – one derived through physical methods, the other through statistical means – against collocated high- and low-accuracy observations. Departing from the majority of validation studies, which rely exclusively upon an array of performance measures, we advocate and implement a rigorous distribution-oriented validation framework, yielding more profound insights and more comprehensive conclusions. Beyond the validation methodology itself, the dataset utilized in this study is noteworthy in its own regard: It incorporates radiometric observations from the newly established and first-ever Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) station situated within a monsoon-influenced continental climate (specifically, the Dwa Köppen classification), in conjunction with irradiance retrievals from the Fengyun-4B geostationary satellite, which are likewise new to the community. The accumulated evidence strongly suggests that the use of low-accuracy observations as a reference in validating irradiance retrievals may entail significant risks, because the discrepancies they introduce can be of a magnitude comparable to the commonly accepted margins of error or improvement (approximately several W m−2 or a few percent) upon which numerous scientific assertions depend."

This record, together with elemental data, vegetation cover reconstruction, and historical emission records from upwind Europe, enables us to examine the response of lake ecology to natural climate change and human activities. Our results indicate an ecological shift around 1870 CE, primarily due to lake acidification and eutrophication induced by the transport and deposition of European air pollutants. These findings suggest that even extremely remote lakes may experience ecological shifts driven by hemispheric-scale anthropogenic influences, providing valuable insights for ecologically sustainable development from a long-term and global perspective.

While air quality benefits of large-scale policies are well studied, those of organization-level activities are more uncertain. We quantify the impact of organizations’ fossil fuel use from electricity purchasing and air travel on climate and air quality using a system-level approach, with data from two universities and one corporation based in greater Boston. We use energy system and aviation emission models to estimate marginal emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollution precursors, and compare monetized air quality impacts calculated using an atmospheric chemistry-transport model with climate impacts from the same activities. Organizational activities were associated with air quality damages of $88 (54–123)/tCO2 (electricity purchase) and $265 (192–337)/tCO2 (air travel), compared to ∼$170–200/tCO2 in climate damages (2015 USD). Air quality impacts vary spatially, with renewable energy purchases and short-haul flight segments having proportionally more impacts in the US Northeast. Activities with the same CO2 emissions can have very different overall monetized benefits, suggesting organizations seeking broader sustainability impacts should consider air quality alongside direct climate impacts."

We present the first CO2, CH4 and CO abundances using a portal Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer in Xining. Ground-based data exceeded satellite/model estimates, indicating higher local emissions. Strong CO discrepancies and ∆XCO–∆XCO2 correlation under easterly winds highlight the value of portable FTIR for urban emission studies. 
 Despite the critical need to understand greenhouse gas and air pollutant concentrations and their emissions characteristics in urban and industrial areas, limited assessments have been conducted in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) cities. Herein, for the first time, we present CO2, CH4 and CO column abundances using a portal Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer (EM27/SUN) in Ganhe Industrial Park (36.546° N, 101.518° E, 2603 m a.s.l.), located in the suburbs of Xining, Qinghai Province, during May–June 2024. Ground-based measurements found to be higher than spaceborne measurements (TROPOMI and IASI) and model forecast (CAMS) across all investigated species, indicating higher local emissions. Notably, significant discrepancies in CO levels are observed, particularly under easterly wind conditions, which transport polluted airmasses from Xining city. To further quantify emissions, we applied a simple dispersion model to the EM27/SUN data and TROPOMI products, estimating an average CO emission rate of 12.3 ± 9.6 and 8.9 ± 7.5 kg s−1, respectively. A wind-assigned anomaly method further applied to the TROPOMI dataset yielded a CO emission rate of 8.5 kg s−1. Additionally, the ground-based observations of ΔXCO / ΔXCO2 ratio exhibits a strong correlation under easterly winds, which suggests an average CO2 emission rate of 550 kg s−1 from Xining city. These findings underscore the utility of portable FTIR spectrometers to enhance our understanding of urban emissions at QTP and demonstrate the potential of combining collaborative ground-based and spaced-based observations to estimate CO2 emissions, particularly in regions with sparse CO2 measurement coverage."

During the events, wavelengths and phases of the tide remain unchanged, but its amplitude strengthens. The variation of heating sources, dissipation, zonal wind latitude shear and gravity wave drag may contribute to the amplification of the tide amplitude. These features provide insight into the dynamical coupling of troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere and lower thermosphere. 
 The stratosphere Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) modulates the migrating diurnal tide (DW1) in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT). DW1 amplitudes are larger during QBO westerly (QBOW) than during easterly (QBOE) phases. Since QBO's discovery in 1953, two rare QBO disruption events occurred in 2016 and 2020. During these events, anomalous westerly winds propagate upward, disrupting normal downward propagation of easterly phase and producing a persistent westerly wind layer. In this study, global responses of DW1 amplitudes and phases in MLT to these QBO disruptions, as well as their underlying mechanisms are investigated, using SABER/TIMED observations, MERRA-2 reanalysis and SD-WACCM-X simulations. Similarity of the DW1 responses to these two events is that DW1 phases and wavelengths exhibit close results to QBOW, whereas amplitudes lie between QBOW and QBOE. DW1 amplitudes in equatorial MLT (maximum difference) vary by 20.5 % and −10.2 % relative to QBOE and QBOW in 2016 event, but by 6.0 % and −21.1 % in 2020 event. In 2016 event, water-vapor radiative and latent heating, jointly modulated by the event and ENSO, increase significantly relative to QBOE. Less dissipation and less tidal energy removal in stratosphere along with gravity-wave (GW) drag in mesosphere tend to enhance DW1 amplitudes. In contrast, in 2020 event, water-vapor heating exhibits a 5 % increase. The dissipation and tidal energy removal has adverse effect on DW1, while GW drag exerts a weaker influence. The enhancement of water vapor heating together with the weaker GW drag likely accounts for the weaker enhancement of DW1 during this event."

Despite international regulation to stop their production, their emissions have not fallen. This may be linked to how they are used to make other chemicals. Our findings show that some banned substances are still reaching the atmosphere, likely through leaks during chemical production, which could slow the recovery of the ozone layer. 
 Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are ozone-depleting substances whose production and consumption have been phased out under the Montreal Protocol in non-Article 5 (mainly developed) countries and are currently being phased out in the rest of the world. Here, we focus on two HCFCs, HCFC-123 and HCFC-124, whose emissions are not decreasing globally in line with their phase-out. We present the first measurement-derived estimates of global HCFC-123 emissions (1993–2023) and updated HCFC-124 emissions for 1978–2023. Around 5 Gg yr−1 of HCFC-123 and 3 Gg yr−1 of HCFC-124 were emitted in 2023. Both HCFC-123 and HCFC-124 are intermediates in the production of HFC-125, a non-ozone-depleting hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) that has replaced ozone-depleting substances in many applications. We show that it is possible that the observed global increase in HCFC-124 emissions could be entirely due to leakage from the production of HFC-125, provided that its leakage rate is around 1 % by mass of HFC-125 production. Global emissions of HCFC-123 have not decreased despite its phase-out for production under the Montreal Protocol, and its use in HFC-125 production may be a contributing factor to this. Emissions of HCFC-124 from western Europe, the USA and East Asia have either fallen or not increased since 2015 and together cannot explain the entire increase in the derived global emissions of HCFC-124. These findings add to the growing evidence that emissions of some ozone-depleting substances are increasing due to leakage and improper destruction during fluorochemical production."

Our findings highlight the changes in aerosol effects on clouds and precipitation under varying thermodynamic conditions, as well as the sensitivity of ACI to meteorological conditions under different pollution regimes, which help to clarify the mechanisms behind the nonlinear variation of ACI with environmental conditions. 
 Aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI) involve complex physical and dynamical mechanisms, in which meteorological conditions play a crucial role. To investigate how the meteorological conditions impact ACI under different pollution regimes (polluted and clean) for marine liquid-phase clouds, the simulations are conducted using the chemistry version of Weather Research and Forecasting Model coupled with spectral-bin cloud microphysics. Our results indicate that, aerosols prolong cloud lifetime in humid environments. In dry conditions, they shorten cloud lifetime under low-to-moderate lower tropospheric stability (LTS) but further suppress the negative effects of entrainment in high-LTS environments with weak entrainment, ultimately extending cloud lifetime. Aerosols generally suppress precipitation but can enhance it during some intense cloud processes by promoting cloud vertical development in low-level clouds and increasing droplet amount in high-level clouds. The coordinated variations of cloud properties with meteorological conditions and aerosols reveal the regulatory role of meteorological factors on ACI. Specifically, under the winter monsoon background, the qualitative influence of aerosols on cloud properties is modulated by variations in updrafts and cold advection (characterized by LTS) driven by atmospheric circulation that co-varies with aerosol concentrations. Meanwhile, changes in atmospheric moisture govern the quantitative effects of aerosols on cloud development."

Using trajectory analysis, we linked atmospheric CH4 variabilities to air mass pathways transported over open water or sea-ice. The study highlights the potential of ship-borne observations to fill significant data gaps in the high Arctic. 
 The sparse network of Arctic land-based stations results in significant data gaps for atmospheric methane (CH4), particularly in sea-ice covered regions. Ship-based measurements can complement these data, improving understanding of regional and seasonal CH4 variability. This study presents continuous atmospheric ship-borne recordings of CH4 concentration and isotopic composition above the open ocean and sea-ice surface during Leg 4 (June–July 2020) and Leg 5 (August–September 2020) of the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition in the central Arctic. Our measurements aim to enhance process understanding by identifying local emission sources and refining transport pathway and atmospheric mixing analysis. We compared three contamination-filtering methods and applied the Pollution Detection Algorithm to the raw data. Comparison with nearby land-based stations and their seasonal cycles suggests ship-borne data capture dynamic changes in CH4 sources, sinks, and transport processes, beyond seasonality. To unravel the underlying processes, we identified air mass transport pathways within the atmospheric boundary layer above the Arctic Ocean and their source areas using five-day backward trajectories from the LAGRANTO tool, based on ERA5 wind field data. Our analysis reveals that CH4 variability is driven by air masses predominantly influenced by open ocean and sea-ice-covered regions, with sea-ice dynamics imparting specific modifications along transport pathways. These findings underscore the importance of air mass transport and origin in shaping central Arctic CH4 variability. The study highlights the value of integrating ship-borne CH4 measurements with trajectory analysis to improve process-level understanding and support enhanced regional modelling."

Further multiphase box model analysis revealed that the heterogeneous uptake of N2O5 is the most significant nitrate formation pathway in NO2-limited urban areas. Additionally, we further analyzed the reasons for this high N2O5 uptake contribution, and discussed the synergistic reduction of nitrates and O3. 
 Particulate nitrate (pNO3-) is a major component of fine particles in Chinese urban areas. However, the relative contributions of pNO3- formation pathways in urban areas remain poorly quantified, particularly under the NO2-limited regime that governs its formation (as defined by the NO2/O3 ratio), which hinders effective particulate pollution control. In this study, comprehensive winter field observations were conducted in urban Xiamen, Southeast China. We observed significantly elevated nighttime pNO3- levels concurrent with increased N2O5 concentrations. Quantification using an observation-constrained model revealed that N2O5 uptake contributed 51.2 % to total pNO3- formation, which was comparable to that of the OH+NO2 reaction. The N2O5 uptake was found to be mainly driven by nocturnal NO3 oxidation capacity (modulated by NO2 and O3 levels) rather than by heterogeneous reaction conditions. Sensitivity simulations further demonstrated that pNO3- formation rate was more sensitive to NOx variations than to VOCs variations. Implementing NOx control measures at nighttime was shown to effectively reduce pNO3- by abating N2O5 uptake while simultaneously preventing daytime O3 increase. Our findings enhance the understanding of pNO3- formation in NO2-limited urban areas and provide valuable insights for developing joint PM2.5 and O3 mitigation strategies."

Satellites rely on accurate spectral line parameters to interpret their data, which are obtained through fitting data from lab-based measurements. This work performs such experiments on the ammonia ν2 band, determining new line parameters which will provide a more accurate basis for modelling satellite measurements of ammonia. 
 Ammonia (NH3) is a toxic pollutant, generally linked to agricultural emissions, and plays a major role in the formation of fine aerosols which have a significant and detrimental effect on human health. NH3 is one of the most significant gases that can be monitored by satellite instruments orbiting the Earth, including the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) and the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS). The interpretation of these measured atmospheric spectra requires accurate radiative transfer modelling, which relies on the quality of the input spectroscopic line parameters.In this work we present new high quality high-resolution infrared spectra of self- and air-broadened NH3 at 296 K using a Bruker IFS 125HR spectrometer and a 24.45 cm pathlength sample cell with silver chloride windows. Using a multispectrum fitting approach, we then determine new spectroscopic line parameters over the range 685 to 1250 cm−1 for the NH3 0100 00 0 s ← 0000 00 0 a and 0100 00 0 a ← 0000 00 0 s transitions associated with the v2 mode; the Q branches of these transitions are the strongest NH3 features observed in atmospheric spectra. Our analysis utilises the Voigt lineshape, with speed-dependent Voigt and Rosenkranz line mixing for the strongest lines. To date this is the most complete experimental and multispectrum analysis of air-broadened NH3 over this spectral region. Our derived spectroscopic line parameters reproduce the new measurements substantially better than line parameters from the HITRAN 2020 database, which were derived from a mixture of ab initio calculations and previous laboratory measurements. We have revised values for parameters such as line intensities and air-broadened Lorentz halfwidths, in some cases by almost 10 %. We have substantially lowered the uncertainties of key parameters, such as line intensities. In addition to the measured speed dependence and Rosenkranz line mixing parameters, which we believe are the first reported for the v2 band of NH3 in air, we also determine a range of parameters for the v2 band that are not currently in HITRAN, for example self- and air-pressure-induced shifts. We expect these new parameters to provide a more accurate basis for incorporation into atmospheric radiative transfer models to measure NH3 concentrations from satellite."

 The Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) uses limb geometry to measure transmittance spectra of Earth's atmosphere by solar occultation. Line-of-sight wind speeds can be derived via Doppler shifts of molecular lines in infrared spectra. The wind look direction angles relative to geodetic north are derived from geometry.

Marciani;Miguel Castrillo;Gladys Utrera;Mario C. Acosta;Bruno P. Kinoshita;Francisco Doblas-Reyes,Evaluating the impact of task aggregation in workflows with shared resource environments: use case for the MONARCH application,"Earth System Model simulations are typically run on large, highly congested flagship computers using workflows. These workflows can consist of thousands of tasks. If these tasks are queued individually, the wait time can add up, resulting in a long response time. In this paper, we explore a technique for aggregating tasks into a single submission. We found that this simple technique reduced the time spent in the queue by up to 7 %. 
 High Performance Computing (HPC) is commonly employed to run high-impact Earth System Model (ESM) simulations, such as those for climate change. However, running workflows of ESM simulations on cutting-edge platforms can take a long time due to the congestion of the system and the lack of coordination between current HPC schedulers and workflow manager systems (WfMS). The Earth Sciences community has estimated the time in queue to be between 10 % to 20 % of the runtime in climate prediction experiments, the most time-consuming exercise. To address this issue, the developers of Autosubmit, a WfMS tailored for climate and air quality sciences, have developed wrappers to submit multiple subsequent workflow tasks – the indivisible unit of compute as defined by the workflow – in a single remote job, without altering any of the tasks. However, although wrappers are widely used in production for community models such as EC-Earth3, MONARCH, and Destination Earth simulations, to our knowledge, the benefits and potential drawbacks have never been rigorously evaluated. Later, the developers of Autosubmit noticed that the impact of using wrappers was related to the past utilization of the user and its group, which the popular scheduler Slurm uses to compute the priority of the queueing jobs. In Slurm's methodology, this past utilization is quantified in the fair share factor. The objective of this paper is to quantify the impact of wrapping subsequent tasks on queue time and understand its relationship with the fair share and the job's CPU and runtime request. To do this, we used a Slurm simulator to reproduce the behavior of the scheduler and, to recreate a representative usage of an HPC platform, we generated synthetic static workloads from data of the LUMI supercomputer and a dynamic workload from a past flagship HPC platform. As an example, we introduced jobs modeled after the MONARCH air quality application in these workloads, and we tracked their queue time. We found that, by simply joining tasks, the total time-to-solution of the simulation reduces up to 7 % with respect to the runtime of the simulations, and we believe that this value is larger the longer the workflow, since longer wrappers could be created and hence less jobs are submitted to the scheduler. This saving translates to absolute terms of about eight days less wasted in queue time for half of the simulations from the IS-ENES3 consortium of CMIP6 simulations. We also identified in the static experiments a high inverse correlation of −0.87, between the queue time and the fair share factor."

Arctic winter climate and cryosphere conditions are changing towards more frequent mild spells. Precipitation is often falling as rain, followed by the formation of basal ice on frozen ground, particularly in Gulf Stream-influenced climates as in Svalbard. Such conditions encapsulate tundra plants in ice for several months, which is assumed to reduce land surface greenness due to plant damage. We investigated whether extensive basal ice (presence and thickness) and increased summer temperatures (growing degree days (GDD)) from in-situ time series impact satellite-derived land surface greenness. We measured greenness as the magnitude and timing of growing season maximum normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Our study covers Svalbard from 2013 to 2023, a decade with record breaking summer temperatures and many icy winters. We found lower maximum NDVI values when basal ice was present only at higher elevations (Estimated effect size: −0.0119, 95% CI: −0.0207 to −0.0031). We further found an eight-day advance in the timing of maximum NDVI (Estimated effect size: −7.56, 95% CI: −14.81 to −0.31) with basal ice presence in the region that was characterized by spatially and temporally extensive basal ice. Ice thickness, in contrast to presence, or GDD did not influence the magnitude or timing of maximum NDVI. Taken together, our findings indicate that basal ice presence could become a driver of vegetation change in the High Arctic as climatic extremes intensify, which could alter tundra greenness over larger landscapes and ultimately influence Arctic food webs."

A fairness framework for data-driven weather forecasting,"As data-driven weather forecasting models increasingly come in operational use, questions of fairness and equitable access to forecast improvements are gaining urgency. This paper introduces a conceptual framework for evaluating outcome-based fairness in global data-driven forecasts, drawing on principles from the algorithmic fairness literature. Specifically, we focus on two criteria: statistical parity (i.e. comparable improvements across protected groups) and conditional independence (i.e. no dependence of improvements on protected variables). Using ECMWF’s AIFS model as a case study and IFS HRES as a baseline, we assess whether forecast improvements are equitably distributed across different income groups and population densities. We find that although AIFS provides substantial overall improvements in forecast skill, these gains are unevenly distributed: on average, wealthier and more densely populated areas are more likely to experience forecast improvements, violating group fairness and conditional independence criteria. We conclude by discussing how fairness-aware loss functions could be incorporated into data-driven weather forecasting systems and argue for a broader integration of fairness considerations into model development and evaluation."

In particular, our understanding of how these conditions are related to reservoir function, size, location, climate, and socio-economic context remains limited. Here, we assess the storage conditions of 6634 global reservoirs during major river basin-scale droughts using normalized storage (NS; storage-to-capacity ratio). River basin-scale drought spells were identified using a 6 month Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) during 1999–2018. Our results showed that reservoirs in Asia had the lowest NS levels during droughts compared to other continents. Reservoirs in Africa and Asia exhibited the largest fluctuations, with median NS fluctuations of 34% and 37%, respectively. Large capacity reservoirs demonstrated greater resilience, whereas smaller reservoirs fluctuated more. Irrigation reservoirs had the lowest NS levels (49%) and the greatest NS fluctuations (33%). Reservoirs in dry climate remained the least filled, with irrigation reservoirs consistently showing the largest fluctuations across all climate zones. We found that reservoirs located in economically stronger countries tend to maintain higher storage levels (61% vs. 46%) and lower fluctuations (23% vs. 33%) during droughts. Furthermore, almost 40% of all reservoirs exhibited a significant (p-value < 0.05) correlation between NS and the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI), highlighting the association between large-scale climate variability and reservoir storage dynamics.

This study introduces the concept of an airshed, as a reduced-complexity, data-driven approach, to quantify transboundary influences and attribute responsibility for premature deaths across jurisdictional boundaries. Applied to PM2.5 concentrations in the contiguous U.S., the airshed approach reveals that over half the states are net exporters of annual premature deaths, while roughly one third have zero net cross-state contribution. Although premature mortality has declined by ∼35% from 1998 to 2022, the cross-state contribution to premature mortality has remained steady at 40% nationally. This approach highlights the unequal distribution of both health risk and responsibility across state lines. The findings underscore the need for further regulatory strategies and cooperative mechanisms to address interstate air pollution."

Overall, wind speeds and sea surface temperature indeed play critical roles in the regulation of aerosol production and diffusion processes, while the sea–air temperature difference is found to be the most vital factor related to the variations of marine aerosol distributions. 
 Marine aerosols critically influence Earth's radiation budget and climate dynamics through their spatial distributions and composition due to their production and transport processes. However, in situ observational datasets remain limited, particularly in the South China Sea (SCS). Based on our comprehensive shipborne measurements, this study presents a quantitative analysis of marine aerosol distributions and compositional variations between the offshore and pelagic regions over the SCS. Our data demonstrate a 120 % increase in offshore aerosol number concentrations (NCs, Dp < 10.37 µm) relative to pelagic baselines, featuring 120 % higher accumulation-mode particles (Dp ≤ 1.981 µm) and 70 % higher coarse-mode particles (1.981 µm < Dp < 10.37 µm), quantitatively confirming continental transport affects spatial distribution of marine aerosols. In contrast, in the pelagic regions, marine aerosols are virtually unaffected by continental source and distinctly represent characteristics of the local production. Meteorological analyses identified wind speed (WS) and sea surface temperature (SST) as primary regulators of NC. However, observed NC variations at fixed WS and SST values suggest additional controlling factors. We demonstrate that sea-air temperature differentials (SST-T2 m) exhibit a stronger correlation (r=-0.82, p < 0.01) with NC than the other meteorological parameters, where increased SST-T2 m led to decreased marine aerosol production. This temperature gradient effect drives pronounced diurnal NC variations, with maximum differences of 35 % observed between daytime, nighttime, and transition periods. These findings provide concrete evidence for the spatial and diurnal variability in marine aerosol distributions over the SCS, thereby further improving understanding of marine aerosol transport and production."

Measurements were taken during two periods in the dry season with different environmental conditions. This data improves our understanding of how ammonia behaves in forests under tropical climates and helps refine models that estimate nitrogen deposition and assess its impact across East Asia. 
 Ammonia (NH3) is a significant contributor to total nitrogen deposition in East Asia. However, process-based observations that specifically focus on the air–surface exchange of NH3 remain limited in this region, especially in Southeast Asia. To clarify the bi-directional exchange process of NH3 under tropical climatic conditions, we present the first observations of NH3 exchange flux over a tropical dry deciduous forest in Thailand during two periods with different canopy and meteorological conditions in the dry season using the aerodynamic gradient method. NH3 concentrations exhibited strong positive correlations with air temperature and negative correlations with wind speed during the leafy period. However, there was no clear correlation between concentrations and meteorological elements during the leafless period. Measured NH3 fluxes fell within the ranges presented in recent studies, with a weighted mean and standard deviation of 0.148 ± 0.240 µg m−2 s−1, and consistently larger during daytime. During the dry season, the tropical dry deciduous forest acted as an emission source of NH3. Across both observation periods, NH3 emissions were governed by air temperature, relative humidity, friction velocity, and solar radiation. While no clear difference in fluxes magnitude was observed between the leafy (0.140 ± 0.240 µg m−2 s−1) and the leafless (0.158 ± 0.239 µg m−2 s−1) periods, the main source of NH3 emission in the tropical dry deciduous forest probably shifted dynamically from stomata to leaf litter due to the changes in meteorological, canopy, and forest floor conditions."

Sea breezes largely confine pollutants below 300 m, while typhoons elevate pollution levels at mid-upper altitudes. These findings highlight that tropical coastal sea breezes and typhoons threaten air quality, necessitating targeted pollution mitigation policies. 
 Atmospheric pollutants in island and coastal environments are profoundly modulated by sea breezes (SB) and typhoons. Understanding the characteristics of pollutants and their photochemical indicators under different airflow regimes is crucial for effective pollution control. Utilizing Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) and a sea-land breeze objective identification algorithm, we reveal distinct spatiotemporal patterns in NO2, HCHO, CHOCHO, and associated photochemistry under varying airflow patterns in a rural coastal area of Hainan, China during the summer of 2024. Non-sea breeze days (NSBDs) showed higher pollutant levels with broader vertical distribution range under conducive meteorological conditions. Conversely, on sea breeze days (SBDs), SB limits pollutant dispersion and its cooling effect suppresses ozone formation. Furthermore, SB also enhances transport of NO2 and biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) below 300 m, influencing ozone formation sensitivity (OFS) throughout SB phases. Typhoons effectively scavenge pollutants via strong winds and precipitation but also facilitate mid-to-high altitude BVOC transport and vertical dispersion of surface pollutants. Photochemical indicator analysis (HCHO/NO2 [FNR] and CHOCHO/NO2 [GNR]) indicates that the VOC-limited regimes persist even at high altitudes during typhoons. Elevated FNR and GNR thresholds suggest that existing OFS classification thresholds are inadequate for low-NO2 tropical coastal rural areas, underscoring the need for region-specific assessments. Given the BVOC-dominated environment and additional inputs from SB and typhoons, GNR proves more reliable than FNR for OFS determination. This study emphasizes the necessity of integrating local meteorology and environment conditions in O3 control strategies, providing a scientific basis for pollution mitigation in tropical coastal regions prone to SB and typhoons."

This tropical air can get trapped in high-pressure areas at high latitudes after the polar vortex breaks down. In this study, remote sensing instruments are used to observe the course of such streamers by measuring the scattered solar radiation. Aerosols get transported to high latitudes at an altitude of about 25–35 km, increasing the aerosol mass there significantly. 
 When the polar vortex meanders and shifts towards the equator, air masses from the tropics and subtropics can be transported towards the pole in so-called tropical-subtropical streamers. These large-scale structures are areas of low potential vorticity and high pressure, containing dry air with high ozone mixing ratios. The presence of these streamers can also be seen in changes in stratospheric optical properties. Satellite instruments such as OMPS-LP measuring the limb scattering of these aerosols are capable of observing an increase in the aerosol extinction coefficient in the mid-stratosphere at the edge of the vortex. The high spatial sampling of the limb instrument ensures that the trajectory of the streamer can be accurately monitored. Following a displacement and deformation of the vortex, aerosol transport to high latitudes occurred in the Northern Hemisphere in spring 2017. The additional stratospheric aerosol mass of around 1000 t at an altitude of 24–38 km remained at middle and high latitudes for just under a month in that year. This aerosol mass increase resulted in an estimated 70 % rise in the total mass within this altitude range at high latitudes. Frozen-in anticyclones, in which low latitude air is trapped in the circulation at high latitudes after the end of the polar vortex, can also be observed in the aerosol extinction coefficient. The observation of a particularly long-lived anticyclone in 2005, which is visible in the extinction coefficient, is presented. This is the first study documenting streamer events and frozen-in anticyclones in stratospheric aerosols."

In this work, we present a modification to the Météo-France weather model ARPEGE (Action de Recherche Petite Echelle Grande Echelle) to improve the forecasting of areas favourable to the persistence of contrails. The spatial correspondence between observations and the modified model is demonstrated and evaluated by appropriate metrics. The modified model can therefore be used for further contrail climate impact applications. 
 Contrails formed by aircraft in ice supersaturated regions (ISSR) can persist and spread for several hours, evolving into cirrus which have a net positive effect on global warming. Reducing this contribution could be achieved through on-purpose flight planning, in particular by avoiding ice supersaturated regions. In this context, a modification to the cloud scheme of the ARPEGE (Action de Recherche Petite Echelle Grande Echelle) operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) model is proposed to enable the representation of ISSRs at cruise altitude. This modification does not require any major algorithmic changes or additional computational effort, and the methodology is transferable to similar parameterizations, commonly used in global circulation models.Humidity forecasts are evaluated using in situ aircraft humidity observations and compared with operational forecasts from ARPEGE and the Integrated Forecast System (IFS). A sensitivity study on neighborhood tolerance and humidity thresholding is carried out, enabling a comprehensive comparison between NWP forecasts. It is shown that the modified cloud scheme allows for supersaturation, significantly improving the representation of humidity with respect to ice, with ISSR discrimination skills close to IFS (hit rate ∼ 80 % and false alarm ratio ∼ 30 % when a neighborhood tolerance of 150 km, i.e. 10 min of flight, is applied). The spatial correspondence between observations and the modified ARPEGE model is illustrated by a commercial flight case study. The modelization of ice supersaturation in ARPEGE can therefore be used for further contrail climate impact applications, together with the associated evaluation methodology, which contributes to the definition of a shared framework for ISSR verification."

This approach allows for a qualitative analysis of sulfate (SO42-) formation processes and comparison with corresponding measurements. 
 Atmospheric sulfate formation influences climate and air quality, yet its chemical pathways remain difficult to constrain. This study utilizes the oxygen isotope anomaly (Δ17O) of sulfate aerosol (ASO4) as a tracer to distinguish formation processes. This work presents a simulation of Δ17O(ASO4) within the contiguous United States, conducted over full annual cycles, which enables the quantification of seasonal and spatial patterns of sulfate oxidation pathways and their response to major emission reductions, for the first time at this scale and temporal coverage. In 2019, Δ17O(ASO4) values were predicted to be below 1 ‰ in the Gulf Coast, indicating acidic, ASO4-rich conditions dominated by S(IV) + H2O2 oxidation, while values above 2 ‰ in the West suggested less acidic conditions, leading to enhanced ASO4 production via S(IV) + O3 oxidation. Peak Δ17O(ASO4) values of ∼4.5 ‰ in April across the Western US reflected O3-driven ASO4 formation during high ammonia (NH3) emissions from fertilization. Between 2006 and 2019, mean Δ17O(ASO4) was predicted to increase by up to 2 ‰, driven by declining sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from regulatory measures. Model comparisons with historical measurements show reasonable agreement in the acidic southeastern US (RMSE = 0.20 ‰, Baton Rouge, LA). However, the model overpredicts Δ17O(ASO4) in the Western US with RMSE values of 0.36 ‰ (La Jolla, CA) and 1.9 ‰ (White Mountain Research Center, CA). This overestimation suggests an excessive model response to aqueous S(IV) + O3 reactions. These findings underscore the diagnostic potential of Δ17O(ASO4) for assessing sulfate formation mechanisms and pinpointing shortcomings in chemical transport models. However, Δ17O(ASO4) observations across the United States remain exceedingly limited, with most available data dating back to the late 1990s and early 2000s, highlighting the need for renewed measurement efforts."

Both emission and deposition occurred, with larger particles settling faster. Weather influenced dispersion and deposition, while wind-driven turbulence enhanced deposition despite stable conditions. Results show aerosol accumulation in snow impacts pollution and snowmelt. Findings help improve aerosol models and pollution studies in cold cities. 
 A comprehensive study of aerosol exchange surface fluxes was conducted at a suburban site in Fairbanks (Alaska) during the Arctic winter as part of the ALPACA experiment. Aerosol fluxes were measured by an eddy covariance system on a snow-covered field located at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) Farm site from 26 January to 17 February 2022. Overall, the flux measurements indicate that the site acted mainly as an emission source for ultrafine particles, while the fluxes for larger particle sizes were substantially bidirectional. Median deposition velocities were 0.61, 0.04, and 8.73 mm s−1 for ultrafine (< 50 nm), accumulation (0.25–0.8 µm), and quasi-coarse (0.8–3 µm) particles, respectively. Anticyclonic synoptic meteorological conditions enhanced atmospheric stagnation and favoured pollutant accumulation near the surface, whereas cyclonic conditions increased aerosol dispersion, thus reducing deposition rates. Despite the frequent conditions of atmospheric stability and pronounced temperature inversions resulting from the strong surface radiative cooling, turbulence was generated mechanically by wind friction, leading to particle deposition. Our findings provide quantitative evidence that wintertime aerosol dry deposition in Arctic urban areas contributes significantly to pollutant accumulation in the snowpack, potentially enhancing contaminant remobilization during snowmelt. Finally, this study provides data for improving aerosol transport models and understanding pollutant-snow interactions in cold urban regions."

The dominant role ​of aerosol-cloud microphysical processes is further quantified, with PM2.5 changes explaining 59-63 % of the decadal trends of light rain. This offers critical insights for aligning air pollution mitigation with climate adaptation strategies. 
 Precipitation dynamics critically regulate Earth's hydrological cycle and climate system, yet the mechanisms driving decadal-scale variations in light rain remain poorly quantified. Our analysis of a 23-year (2000–2022) national-scale dataset reveals contrasting trends in light precipitation occurrence: a significant decline (1.0 d yr−1, p < 0.05) during 2000–2013 followed by a pronounced increase (1.9 d yr−1, p < 0.01) in 2013–2022. Cross-temporal analysis demonstrates a national wide inverse correlation (r=-0.55, p < 0.01) between aerosol concentrations and light rain frequency in the China's Emission Control Era, when the PM2.5 shows an upward trajectory before 2013 followed by a markedly downward decline thereafter, providing a natural experiment to quantify aerosol effects in precipitation. Through multi-algorithm machine learning and causal inference modeling, we further identify aerosol-cloud microphysical processes as the dominant driver, with PM2.5 concentration changes explaining 59 %–63 % of the decadal trends of light rain. As a result, the PM2.5 reduction (increase) enhances (reduces) light rain frequency by +1.97 (−2.08) d yr−1. Meteorological factors showed negligible temporal variability and thus insignificant explanatory power (mostly < 5 % for each individual factor) over a decadal scale. Our findings establish, for the first time, the quantifiable aerosol microphysical effect on light precipitation trends, highlighting dual benefits for China's emission control policies that PM2.5 reduction in 2013–2022 simultaneously enhanced light rain frequency while improving air quality. This work offers critical insights for aligning air pollution mitigation with climate adaptation strategies."

By refining grid resolution and improving convection representation, the model more accurately simulates carbon monoxide transport. Comparisons with satellite and in situ observations highlight its ability to capture seasonal variations and improve our understanding of atmospheric transport. 
 Lagrangian modeling of transport, as implemented in the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS), connects the advective (reversible) component of transport along 3D trajectories with mixing, the irreversible component. Here, we investigate the interplay between strongly localized convective uplifts and large-scale flow dynamics in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). We revisit the Lagrangian formulation of convection in CLaMS-3.0/MESSy, driven by ECMWF's ERA5 reanalysis, and further develop the model. These developments include refining spatial resolution in the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) and decoupling the frequency of the adaptive grid procedure – which captures isentropic mixing and redefines Lagrangian air parcels – from the parameterization of convection.To improve the model's UTLS transport representation, particularly from the PBL over days to weeks, we derive zonally and seasonally resolved climatologies of CO partial columns (XCO, spanning 147–68 hPa) and compare them with Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) observations, as well as in situ data. Incorporating a parameterization for unresolved convection significantly improves CO anomaly representation in the UTLS, particularly in capturing seasonal and spatial patterns. While the simulated absolute XCO values align better with ACE-FTS, the model reproduces MLS anomalies more accurately, suggesting MLS better represents CO variability. In situ observations in the boreal polar region generally support lower ACE-FTS CO values, while MLS better represents CO enhancements in air affected by the Asian summer monsoon above 10 km."

This study presents a simple approach to describing this organisation. First, the convective field is decomposed into elementary structures. Then, four scores are computed to describe the size, density, spacing scale and departure from randomness of the cores. This method robustly characterises the organisation of convection. 
 Deep convective systems (DCSs) play a fundamental role in atmospheric dynamics, precipitation, cloud radiative effects, and large-scale circulations. Their associated deep convection exhibits complex spatial arrangements, commonly referred to as convective organization, which exerts an influence on the systems' morphology that needs to be assessed. However, quantifying this organization remains challenging due to the lack of a general, robust, and consensual metric, in both observations and models. This study introduces a new method for characterizing the spatial arrangement of deep convective cores within the cloud shield of individual DCSs. The first step of this technique consists in decomposing the convective mask into elementary structures. Four key parameters are then extracted to fully capture the organization of a scene. Two of these parameters characterize the overall properties of the convective field, such as the size and convective fraction of convective cores. The remaining two parameters are specifically designed to describe the spatial arrangement of deep convective cores: a characteristic convective scale using two-dimensional (2D) autocorrelation and an evaluation of the deviation from randomness by comparing it to a stochastic ensemble of synthetic convective fields. Two independent datasets, derived from satellite observations and idealized kilometer-scale numerical simulations, each employing distinct convective core identification techniques are used to assess the generalization of the method. Finally, an unsupervised clustering algorithm identifies four distinct classes, revealing consistent and physically sound patterns of convective organization across both datasets. This demonstrates the method's robustness and suitability to characterize the spatial organization of convective cores in convective systems' cloud shield."

It examines the influence of aerosol chemical compounds linked to air mass origins, as well as their relationship with the efficiency of aerosol growth. Such a study provides a better understanding of the interactions between aerosols and water vapour, which is important for reducing the uncertainties surrounding the Earth's radiative balance. 
 From May to August 2020 and during summer 2024, aerosol backscatter and relative humidity profiles were measured near Paris region using the Water Vapour and Aerosol Lidar (WALI). The campaigns included observations on the Saclay plateau (48°42′42′′ N, 02°08′52′′ E) and in Paris (48°50′12′′ N, 02°20′10′′ E) during the 2024 Olympic Games. The high vertical (15 m) and temporal (15 min) resolution of WALI allow to study aerosol optical properties and water vapour profiles under stable atmospheric conditions. This study focuses on characterizing aerosol hygroscopic growth using lidar-derived aerosol backscatter coefficients as a function of relative humidity. Eight case studies were selected where the potential temperature gradient was neutral and the water vapor mixing ratio was constant with height. These include long range air pollution transport from the Benelux region, low hygroscopic aerosol events, and a sea salt-pollution mixture episode. Hygroscopicity was assessed using CAMS model analyses and reanalyses, allowing attribution of chemical composition to observed optical changes. Good agreement was found between lidar-derived hygroscopic properties and CAMS-inferred aerosol types. Lidar growth factors ranged from 0.3 to 1.5, with higher values linked to sea salt presence, consistent with literature values. Aerosols hygroscopicity is also studied using Mie's theory, as aerosols can be considered nearly spherical. Differences between extinction and backscatter-based growth retrievals are interpreted through Hänel's formalism. The results illustrate the potential of Raman lidar observations to provide valuable constraints on aerosol hygroscopicity, offering complementary information for chemistry-transport models and contributing to reduce uncertainties in aerosol-cloud interaction estimates."

Tests with different aerosol types show that the method can provide reliable results and improve the description of larger particles. This work demonstrates the potential of future satellite observations to deliver a clearer picture of global air pollution and its role in climate. 
 Using an improved regularization method, we attempt to derive microphysical parameters (effective radius reff, surface area concentration St, volume concentration Vt) of aerosol particle size distribution directly from the detection results of Aerosol and Carbon dioxide Detection Lidar (ACDL), which is the first spaceborne high spectral resolution lidar (HSRL) based iodine filter. The backscatter and extinction coefficients at 532, 1064, and 1572 nm are adopted for regularization algorithm. Preliminary simulations for different aerosol types with monomodal and bimodal lognormal size distributions demonstrate the algorithm performance of the 3α + 3β optical data combination. For monomodal aerosols, the retrieval errors are constrained within 15 % for reff, 30 % for St, and 35 % for Vt. In bimodal cases, errors increase to 18 %–35 % for reff, 35 % for St, and up to 60 % for Vt. Sensitivity analysis confirms that systematic errors of ±20 % in input optical data induce parameter uncertainties below 60 %. Case studies reveal four typical aerosols profiles: urban (reff ∼ 0.47 µm), smoke (reff ∼ 0.57 µm), dust (reff ∼ 0.61 µm), and marine (reff ∼ 0.83 µm). The inversion reff is compared with CALIPSO and LIVAS, which confirms high consistency for marine and dust, while urban and smoke retrievals show slightly larger. The inclusion of 1572 nm significantly enhances coarse-mode retrieval accuracy. The error statistics of the simulations and the actual comparison results show that the proposed inversion algorithm can reliably derive the particle size distribution parameters from the spaceborne multi-wavelength lidar ACDL. This work provides preliminary validation of ACDL's capability to retrieve vertically resolved global aerosol microphysical characterization."

The retrieval is validated using synthetic data for idealized and realistic cloud cases and applied to measurements of the airborne specMACS instrument during the HALO-(AC)3 campaign. It provides high spatial resolution information about phase partitioning at cloud top and allows for example to study phase transitions in Arctic mixed-phase clouds. 
 Mixed-phase clouds are frequently observed in the Arctic and still not well represented in climate and general circulation models. The spatial distribution of cloud thermodynamic phase and its partitioning are important quantities since they affect the radiative effect of clouds as well as cloud life time. In this work, a new quantitative retrieval method of cloud thermodynamic phase partitioning based on multi-angle polarimetry is presented. The polarization signal is sensitive to cloud thermodynamic phase since liquid water and ice particles have different shapes and different optical properties. The basic idea of the retrieval is to fit simulations obtained from a forward operator to measurements in the cloudbow range between 135 and 165° scattering angle and the slope range between 60 and 110° to determine a quantitative ice fraction. Either plane-parallel clouds or three-dimensional (half-spherical) clouds are assumed in the simulations. The retrieval was validated using synthetic data. 3D radiative transfer simulations were performed for different idealized cloud cases as well as for a realistic field of low-level Arctic mixed-phase clouds. As the retrieval is based on polarization, it is sensitive to cloud top. The retrieved ice fraction is here defined as the ratio of the ice optical thickness to the liquid plus ice optical thickness and corresponds to the mean ice fraction of the uppermost cloud layer from cloud top to an optical thickness of about 1 to 2, depending on the solar zenith angle. In addition, the retrieval was applied to measurements of the polarization-resolving cameras of the specMACS instrument during the HALO–(𝒜𝒞)3 campaign, providing two-dimensional fields of cloud thermodynamic phase partitioning with a high spatial resolution of about 100 m."

By simulating its performance, we show that GEMINI-UK will significantly reduce uncertainties in these flux estimates, complementing data from existing tall towers and future satellite missions. The network will strengthen the UK's ability to track greenhouse gases, evaluate climate policies, and meet net-zero goals. 
 The Greenhouse gas Emissions Monitoring network to Inform Net-zero Initiatives for the UK (GEMINI-UK) includes ten Bruker EM27/SUN instruments located across the UK that collect dry average volume mixing ratios of CO2 and methane (XCO2 and XCH4). The primary objective of GEMINI-UK is to infer regional net flux estimates of CO2 and methane across the UK that can be used to provide actionable information to the UK Government. The instruments are housed in bespoke autonomous weatherproof enclosures that help maximize cloud-free data collection throughout the calendar year. The network will become fully operational in late 2025. As part of our commissioning phase, we designed the network so it would deliver the biggest uncertainty reduction in net CO2 fluxes, based on prior emission inventories.  The ten sites are located at UK education institutions and a national scientific research laboratory, underlining our commitment to make these data openly available to all. In this study, we use a series of closed-loop numerical experiments for the nominal calendar year of 2019 to quantify the theoretical benefit of using this new ground-based remote sensing network, accounting for cloudy scenes, to estimate spatially resolved net fluxes of CO2 and methane across the UK. Based on our results, we expect that GEMINI-UK will deliver significant error reductions in CO2 flux estimates,  up to 51 % in January and up to 59 % in July (GEMINI-UK only), and up to 8 % in January and up to 24 % in July when combined with existing tall tower measurements collected across England and Ireland.  Despite the network being optimally designed to enhance our understanding of UK CO2 fluxes, we expect, based on our calculations, that GEMINI-UK will also substantially reduce uncertaintes of methane emissions, achieving a priori error reductions up to 55 % in January and up to 75 % in July (GEMINI-UK only), and up to 10 % in January and up to 29 % in July when combined with the existing tall tower sites. In the context of augmenting the information collected by the established tall tower network, we find that GEMINI-UK data have the greatest potential over high flux regions in the central and southern parts of the UK during winter months, and over broader southern to northern regions during the summer months. More broadly, the data collected by GEMINI-UK will also provide the basis to evaluate satellite observations of these trace gases, thereby providing confidence in their ability to supplement data collected by GEMINI-UK and the tall tower network."

 Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is one of the key pollutants with profound implications for air quality, and human health, and is needed to establish the air quality health index (AQHI).  Currently, over 600 surface air monitoring stations are distributed across Canada and the United States measuring NO2, but many areas remain unmonitored leading to incomplete information for health risk assessments. This study leverages Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) satellite observations and machine learning models to derive high-resolution surface NO2 concentrations, provides enhanced spatial coverage and accuracy, revealing urban-rural NO2 gradients across North America. Existing traditional methods rely on scaling with modeled profiles to obtain NO2 surface concentrations from satellite observations.  Here, we compare this traditional method to a machine learning approach that utilizes NO2 observations from TROPOMI, together with meteorological parameters, land cover type, topography, and emission inventories. Our results show that the machine learning (using random forest) yields less bias between the surface monitoring measurements and the “satellite-derived” surface concentrations, significantly improved the correlation coefficient (R2∼ 0.77–0.91) compared to the traditional method (R2∼ 0.39–0.57) and yields to significantly less bias."

Compared to the conventional time-domain approach, the proposed method offers a substantial improvement. Despite some limitations, this study marks a significant advancement in turbulence estimation using pulsed Doppler lidars, which presents promising potential for wind turbine load assessments. 
 Accurate estimation of second-order turbulence statistics using pulsed Doppler lidar has been a challenge for a long time, mainly due to the negative influence of probe volume averaging. The present study aims to investigate a novel approach to extracting first- and second-order turbulence statistics directly from the average Doppler spectra in the frequency domain. The main hypothesis is that averaging Doppler spectra over 10 min intervals can mitigate the influence of probe volume averaging and random noise in velocity retrievals, thereby improving estimates of velocity variance. To achieve this, we develop a new analytical model for the time-averaged Doppler spectrum, beginning with a theoretical formulation based on the beat signal within the range gate. The model is applied to 10 min averaged Doppler spectra collected by a pulsed lidar system pointing toward a sonic anemometer mounted on a meteorological mast in front of a Vestas V52 wind turbine at the DTU Risø campus in Denmark. Validation results demonstrate that the Doppler spectra model, when fitted to 400 ns nominal pulse durations, closely matches sonic anemometer measurements in both mean radial velocities and standard deviations. This agreement is quantified by the orthogonal least squares fit slopes of 0.976 for the mean velocities and 0.983 for the standard deviations. In comparison to the conventional time-domain approach, which accounts for only 72.1 % of the standard deviation, the proposed spectral method captures 98.3 % of the standard deviation observed in the sonic anemometer. However, this model does not accurately estimate variances using the short pulse (200 ns) of the instrument. Despite this limitation for the short pulse, the proposed method is an important step towards better turbulence estimation from pulsed Doppler lidars."

 The intense wildfires in Australia, during the 2019–2020 fire season, generated massive pyro-cumulonimbus (pyro-Cb) clouds, and injected an unprecedented amount of smoke aerosols into the upper troposphere–lower stratosphere (UTLS). The smoke aerosols produced a self-sustaining confined anticyclonic vortex, that ascended up to 35 km altitude by March 2020 by diabatic heating of radiation absorbing aerosols. This vortex transported ozone-poor tropospheric air into the ozone-rich stratosphere, thus forming a transient ozone mini-hole. This study investigates the early evolution of the dynamically-generated ozone mini-hole, using satellite and ground-based observations, supported by modelling information. Ozone anomalies within the vortex are tracked and quantified by satellite observation. In particular, ad-hoc in-vortex observations are derived by coupling the IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) satellite observations and meteorological reanalysis information of the vortex. With these observations, a 30 %–40 % ozone reduction is observed immediately after the event in a 6 km partial stratospheric column, which exponentially decreased to ∼ 7 % by the end of January with an e-folding time of about one week, as the vortex ascended in the stratosphere. A total ozone column reduction of ∼ 7 %, immediately after the pyro-Cb injection, was observed with IASI and the TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) satellite instrument. Consistently, ground-based measurement at Lauder, New Zealand showed a localised ozone reduction reaching ∼ 10 % (total column) and ∼ 20 % (in-vortex stratospheric partial column) associated with two vortex overpasses. These results provide insights into the impacts of extreme wildfires and pyro-Cbs on the dynamics and composition of the stratosphere."

The framework enables evaluation of the performance of CMLs as rainfall sensors in a probabilistic manner and assessment of information content of an arbitrary variable for the rainfall retrieval, e.g. synoptic type. The study shows that using the information theory concept can also directly improve data processing of attenuation data, in this case dry-wet classification. 
 Commercial microwave links (CMLs) are opportunistic rainfall sensors that provide indirect rainfall estimates from attenuation data. This is achieved by separating raindrop path attenuation from observed total loss and converting it to rainfall intensity using the k−R formula. Various methods have been proposed for CML rainfall retrieval using either attenuation data alone or additional environmental variables. However, most studies evaluate CML rainfall estimates deterministically and do not reveal how individual processing steps and variables affect rainfall estimation uncertainty. This study proposes to evaluate CML processing using an information-theoretic framework and demonstrates this probabilistic concept on two particular problems. The first analysis reveals the reduction of uncertainty in CML rainfall estimates by measuring the information content of individual variables and their combinations. Both quantitative and qualitative predictors are used, including sensor variables such as CML signal attenuation, and environmental variables such as temperature, or synoptic types. The rainfall intensity derived from the k−R formula and combined with synoptic type forms an informative combination of sensor and environmental variables for reducing uncertainty regarding reference rainfall intensity. The second analysis demonstrates the application of information theory for classifying wet and dry periods using signal attenuation data and other environmental variables. In a limited single-link evaluation, a non-parametric model indicated better performance than the reference approaches suggesting the potential of information theory in CML processing. The proposed framework enables the identification of informative sensor and environmental variables, the evaluation of the effects of different processing steps on the estimated rainfall intensity, or the development of a wet-dry classification model calibrated in a probabilistic manner ultimately facilitating the improvement of CML rainfall estimates."

The temperature profiles are calibrated by values obtained from chemiluminscence of the hydroxyl radical around 86 km. The temperature profiles are successfully compared with satellite and lidar data. 
 In this study we examine the performance of the 354.8 nm Rayleigh temperature channel of the Raman lidar at the Schneefernerhaus high-altitude research station (UFS) in the Bavarian Alps (at 2675 m a.s.l.). The temperature reference value of the retrieval is adjusted to match the temperature determined from the OH* airglow around 86 km by the GRIPS instruments at UFS. In this way the quality of the 1 h measurements of the lidar is improved above 70 km. Comparisons were made between the UFS lidar, the MLS (Microwave Limb Sounder) satellite-borne instrument and the 354.8 nm temperature channel of Hohenpeißenberg (MOHp) differential-absorption ozone lidar. Between 35 and 70 km we see a positive offset of the UFS temperatures with respect to the MLS values of up to about 9 K. This behaviour just slightly exceeds the expectations from earlier work. Despite a horizontal distance of just 40 km between UFS and MOHp acceptable agreement below 70 km was found in several cases. However, in general, the MOHp temperatures were slightly lower than those above UFS. We discuss potential technical issues and suggest solutions for upgrading the UFS lidar system. A significant enhancement of the laser repetition rate is recommended."

A total of 3447 sandy beaches were identified with high accuracy by integrating Sentinel-1/2 satellite imagery, terrain, and nighttime light data. Since 1990, the area at risk from human infrastructure squeeze has significantly increased. This study provides an updated dataset to support sustainable coastal management. 
 Sandy beaches provide essential ecological and economic services, but their functions are increasingly threatened by human activities. Analyzing the spatial distribution of China's sandy beaches and the impacts of human activities offers valuable insights for coastal resource management and ecological protection. However, remote sensing technologies face challenges such as limited data sources and tidal influences, which affect recognition accuracy. Therefore, integrating multi-source remote sensing data and reducing the impact of tidal fluctuations to improve recognition accuracy remains a key challenge. This study proposes an innovative approach utilizing multi-source data and an ensemble learning model to identify sandy beaches in China (2016–2024). By integrating Sentinel-1/2 satellite data, terrain data, and nighttime light data, along with spectral, index, terrain, texture, and polarization features, sandy beaches were identified across multiple years, and the results were consolidated into a unique dataset to analyze spatial patterns and risks from human infrastructure squeeze. (1) High-precision classification identified 3347 sandy beaches in China, covering a total area of 320.50 km2.

This study introduces an efficient method to identify BHE, 13 times quicker, firstly enables the creation of BHE dataset in the North Pacific from 1993 to 2023. We verified BHE maintains strong coherence and contributes to westward transport about 1.5 Sv. We found some previously unidentified coherent eddies and analyzed their coherence. This represents first comprehensive analysis of BHE. 
 The methodologies employed for the identification of coherent ocean eddies can be categorized as either Eulerian and Lagrangian. Among Lagrangian structures, Black Hole Eddies (BHEs) exhibit the highest degree of material coherence and conservation, making them particularly suitable for studying the transport and retention of oceanic materials. This study presents an efficient Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)-based BHE identification algorithm for the North Pacific (0–50° N, 130–270° E), enhancing computational efficiency by approximately 13 times compared to the existing methods. Using this algorithm, a Black Hole Eddy dataset (BHE v1.0) is constructed for the first time in the North Pacific Ocean, based on satellite-derived surface geostrophic velocity data from  1 January 1993 to  5 May 2023. BHE v1.0 contains 18 387 eddies with radius larger than 20 km and lifetimes longer than 4 weeks and captures both the spatial-temporal characteristics and the trajectories of coherent eddies throughout lifetimes. Through the advection of Lagrangian particles in Eulerian eddy, rotationally coherent Lagrangian vortices (RCLVs) and BHEs, it is confirmed that BHEs retain material coherence throughout their lifecycle without significant mixing. Additionally, approximately 6 % of BHEs, which do not overlap with any RCLVs or Eulerian eddies, are identified and referred to as the Naked Black Hole Eddy and further analyze its coherence through advection. Transport analysis shows that BHEs induce westward transport of about 1.5 Sv, three times weaker than the transport attributed to the broader RCLVs, suggesting it likely represents a more accurate estimate of the coherent, non-leaky component of oceanic transport, as BHEs isolate the materially coherent core of the eddies. These findings address the existing gap in Black Hole Eddy datasets within the field of oceanography and provides a novel perspective for studying the interactions between coherent eddies and oceanic physical phenomena.

 Land surface energy, water and carbon fluxes are key for understanding Earth's climate system, yet global continuous high resolution fluxes datasets remain scarce. In this study, we present a global long-term (2000–2020) hourly 9 km dataset of terrestrial water-energy-carbon fluxes, generated by integrating model simulations, in-situ measurements, and machine learning with remote sensing and meteorological data. First, the integrated STEMMUS-SCOPE model was deployed to simulate land surface fluxes over 170 sites with in-situ measurements. The selected model-output variables include net radiation (Rn), latent heat flux (LE), sensible heat flux (H), soil heat flux (G), gross primary productivity (GPP), solar-induced fluorescence at 685 and 740 nm (SIF685, SIF740). Next, optimal interpolation was applied to merge Rn, LE, and H from STEMMUS-SCOPE simulations with eddy covariance observations. The optimal estimate of Rn, LE, H alongside STEMMUS-SCOPE simulated G, GPP, SIF685, SIF740 were then used as training data-pairs to develop the emulator using a multivariate Random Forest (RF) regression algorithm, referred to as Random Forest with Optimal Interpolation (RF_OI) to predict terrestrial water-energy-carbon fluxes. The results demonstrate that RF_OI can estimate land surface fluxes with Pearson Correlation Coefficient score (r-score) values higher than 0.88 except for GPP (Rn 0.99, LE 0.88, H 0.92, G 0.92, GPP 0.8, SIF685 0.99, SIF740 0.99). The testing results on independent stations (which were not included for developing the emulator) show r-score values higher than 0.8. The feature importance indicates that incoming shortwave radiation, surface soil moisture, and leaf area index are top predictor variables that determine the prediction performance.

We combined long-term tide gauge records and satellite data to create a new global sea level record from 1950 to 2022. Our results reveal how natural climate patterns, including El Niño, La Niña, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, influence rapid present-day sea level change. The data product enhances understanding of climate–sea level interactions. 
 Rapidly rising sea level is one of the major adverse consequences of anthropogenic climate change. Sea level rise poses an existential threat to coastal populations, particularly for urban settlements with accelerating growth rates. Contemporary empirical sea level reconstructions have been used to conflate short-term (∼ 3 decades) satellite altimetry geocentric sea level data and long-term (50 years or longer) tide gauge records to better estimate reliable sea level rise towards multi-decadal to centennial time scales. However, adequate separations and quantifications of low-frequency climate patterns and sea level trends globally at regional scales remain elusive. Here, we propose a new sea level reconstruction framework that incorporates Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) into the contemporary Cyclostationary EOF with Reduced Space Optimal Interpolation (CSEOF-OI) algorithm to better reconstruct sea level fields. Using 225 selected long-term gap-filled tide gauge records with vertical land motion adjusted and satellite altimetry, our global reconstructed monthly sea level time series, January 1950–January 2022, exhibits distinct delineations between modeled climate patterns and sea level trends at 1°×1° regional scales. The separated sea level patterns include trends, modulated annual cycles, the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The third principal component of the reconstructed sea level exhibits a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.87 with the Niño 3.4 ENSO index, and the fourth principal component correlates at 0.75 with the PDO index, indicating good agreement. The global mean sea level trend, accounting for the predominant climate periodicities, is 1.9 ± 0.2 mm yr−1 (95 % confidence), and the estimate during the satellite altimetry era (January 1993–December 2021) is 3.2 ± 0.3 mm yr−1 (95 % confidence). Compared with previous studies, we conclude that our 72-year sea-level reconstruction allows us to better separate the ENSO and PDO climate patterns, as well as the sea level they induced. Finally, we show that the short-term (5-year) rates of ENSO and PDO patterns significantly affect sea level both on a global and regional scale, altering global mean sea level trends by up to 1.1 ± 0.5 mm yr−1 (January 2011–January 2016). Over the past seven decades, the climate patterns exerted a minor impact on sea level trends, but substantially modulated apparent regional sea level accelerations, particularly in the western Pacific (e.g., 0.09 ± 0.05 mm yr−2 at the Kuroshio Current), and in the east and central equatorial Pacific Ocean (e.g., −0.04 ± 0.03 mm yr−2 near Costa Rica).

GFEI v3 uses emissions as reported by countries in national inventories for 2020, and new infrastructure information, including a new dataset on coal mine locations. The goal of updating GFEI is to provide a more accurate spatial representation of the country-reported national inventories, allowing comparison with methane monitoring data. 
 The Global Fuel Exploitation Inventory (GFEI) is a global 0.1° × 0.1° resolution gridded inventory of methane emissions from oil, gas, and coal exploitation. Here, we present GFEI v3 with updated national emissions to 2020 using reports submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), leading to new global emissions of 23, 20, and 31 Tg a−1 for oil, gas, and coal, respectively. We also use new geospatial information from the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Mapping database (OGIM v1) for spatial distribution of global oil-gas methane emissions. We use coal mine locations from the Global Energy Monitor's Global Coal Mine Tracker (GCMT), combined with our own estimates for mine-level methane emissions, to distribute national emissions between coal mine locations. Our mine-level methane emission estimates use country specific emission factors for top producing countries supplemented with modeled emission factors based on coal mine depth and grade. We see the greatest change in the spatial distribution of emissions in GFEI v3 compared to v2 in China due to the use of GCMT for coal mine locations. Large point source plumes (super-emitters) observed by the NASA EMIT instrument are co-located with infrastructure identified in GFEI v3, but the magnitude of the measured emissions is poorly correlated with the gridded emissions in GFEI. This may reflect missing or misrepresented sources in GFEI v3 but also the sporadic nature of the super-emitter measurements used here. By aligning GFEI v3 with national UNFCCC reports and using state-of-the-science geospatial information, the inventory can be confronted with satellite observations of atmospheric methane through inverse modeling to evaluate and improve the UNFCCC reports. We plan to continue updating GFEI to align with reported national emissions and new geospatial information, including assessment of GFEI spatial accuracy through comparison to super-emitter detections.

 Accurate estimation and monitoring of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) are essential for understanding carbon dynamics, managing forest resources, and guiding environmental policies.

This study combines multi-source remote sensing data with residual neural networks (ResNets) to develop the first 30 m resolution annual China Forest AGB dataset (1985–2023) with uncertainty quantification. Validation results confirm the robustness of the ResNets model, achieving an R2 of 0.91, RMSE of 16.49 Mg ha−1, and Bias of 0.50 Mg ha−1 against GEDI footprint AGBD, and an R2 of 0.63, RMSE of 68.26 Mg ha−1, and Bias of −19.87 Mg ha−1 against independent multi-year ground survey data.

The dataset reveals two emission peaks linked to 2015–2016 El Niño and 2019–2020 extreme heat events, driven mainly by tropical regions such as the Amazon. It highlights the region-specific sensitivity of biogenic isoprene emissions to temperature anomalies, providing new insights into their roles in air quality and climate feedbacks. 
 Isoprene, the most emitted biogenic volatile organic compound, exerts a remarkable influence on atmospheric oxidation capacity, air quality, and climate. Most existing top-down atmospheric estimates of isoprene emissions rely on observational formaldehyde (HCHO) as an indirect proxy, even though HCHO is produced from multiple precursors. Recent advances in satellite retrievals of isoprene concentrations from the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) enable a direct constraint on isoprene emission inversions. Yet global, multi-year isoprene-based atmospheric inversions are still lacking. Here, we present global, monthly biogenic isoprene emission maps spanning 2013–2020, derived from a mass-balance inversion framework that assimilates CrIS-retrieved isoprene columns into the LMDZ-INCA chemistry–transport model. The global biogenic isoprene emissions average is of 456±238 Tg C yr−1 over 2013–2020, which is broadly consistent with existing inventories and HCHO-based inversion estimates. The LMDZ-INCA simulations using this estimate of the emissions exhibit improved spatial agreement and reduced biases relative to two independent satellite HCHO retrieval products and to ground-based optical measurements, confirming the robustness of this inversion framework. The seasonal cycle of emissions is dominated by the Northern Hemisphere, driven by the strong seasonality in temperature and vegetation biomes. Interannually, emissions vary by on average 14 Tg C yr−1 (1-sigma standard deviation). Two major emission peaks are found in 2015–2016 (456 Tg C yr−1) and 2019–2020 (478 Tg C yr−1), coinciding with El Niño and widespread extreme heat-wave events, underscoring the dominant influence of temperature anomalies that increase biogenic emissions. Regional analyses identify the Amazon as the largest contributor to the interannual variability, accounting for 22.3 % of the global interannual variance in isoprene emissions. Temperature emerges as the primary driver of regional interannual emissions, with its influence modulated by leaf area index and radiation to varying degrees across regions. As one of the earliest attempts at a global, multi-year inversion based on isoprene observations, this dataset provides input for air quality and climate-chemistry models.

This approach also reduces noise from clouds and shadows while ensuring high computational efficiency using GEE. We then mapped burned area using artificial neural network modeling across global forests. Finally, we delineated individual fire patches through spatial–temporal clustering and extracted their key attributes. Across global forests, we identified a total of 11.97 million individual fire patches burning 7.3 Mha yr−1over 1984–2022. Validation indicated omission errors ranging from 12.2 % to 36.8 % and commission errors ranging from 6.4 % to 23.2 % across diverse forest types. Intercomparison with existing Landsat products revealed strong agreement in annual burned area estimates and fire patch detection, with discrepancies mainly arising from within-fire delineation and small fire detection. This dataset offers a valuable resource for quantifying fire impacts and advancing the understanding of contemporary and future fire regimes in global forests.

This dataset will contribute to the understanding of the mechanism of land-atmosphere interactions on the TP and support comprehensive research of the energy-water cycle and climate change. 
 In recent decades, the climate of Tibetan Plateau has undergone notable changes, which has a strong influence on global climate systems and human activities, making it a research hotspot. However, due to its extreme elevation, harsh environment, and complex underlying surface, long-term observations of the central Plateau's atmospheric vertical profiles have been challenging and scientific data sharing is crucial and in urgent need. This paper presents a 9-year observational dataset (2014–2022) with hourly temporal resolution from the Nagqu region of northern Tibet. The dataset is a combination of four field stations covering the central Tibetan Plateau, which recorded near-surface meteorological data, radiation budget, turbulent fluxes, and soil hydrothermal characteristics. All observational items in this dataset underwent data processing and quality control to ensure data quality. This dataset represents the most detailed raw observational data on the central Tibetan Plateau's spatial coverage and recent changes. It holds significant value in revealing energy and water exchanges between the land surface and the atmosphere on the Tibetan Plateau.

Through a clever use of differences between weather station measurements and reanalysis data, we estimated more realistic surface roughness values and created a new high-resolution map for China. This map greatly improves wind speed simulations and supports better decisions in wind-related fields. 
 Aerodynamic roughness length (z0) is a key parameter determining near-surface wind profiles, significantly influencing wind-related studies and applications. In high-roughness surface areas, surface roughness has been substantially altered by land use changes such as urbanization. However, many numerical models still assign long-standing and fixed z0 based on traditional land cover types, neither accounting for shifts in land cover nor updating class-specific z0, leaving z0 values in high-roughness surface regions outdated and unreliable. To address this issue, this study proposed a cost-effective method to estimate z0 values at weather stations by adjusting z0 values to minimize the wind speed differences between ERA5 reanalysis data and weather station observation data. Using this approach, z0 values were derived for 1837 stations in the high-roughness surface areas across China. Based on these estimates, a high-resolution monthly gridded z0 dataset was then developed for high-roughness surface areas in China using Random Forest Regression algorithm. Simulations with Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model show that implementation of the new z0 dataset significantly improves the accuracy of 10 m wind speed over high-roughness surface areas, reducing mean wind speed errors by 79.8 % and 78.0 % compared to the default z0 in WRF and a latest gridded z0 dataset from Peng et al. (2022), respectively. Independent validations of 100 m wind speed against anemometer tower data further confirm the dataset's reliability. Therefore, this approach is valuable for wind-dependent studies and applications, such as urban planning, air quality management, and wind energy utilization, by enabling more accurate simulations of wind speed in high-roughness surface areas."

The method was applied to the city of Munich, where we present bottom-up emission estimates for the years 2019 to 2022. The estimates are compared against official municipal reports as well as national and European downscaled inventories. 
 Traffic in urban areas is an important source of greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollutant emissions. Estimating traffic-related emissions is therefore a key component in compiling a city emission inventory. Inventories are fundamental for understanding, monitoring, managing, and mitigating local pollutant emissions.We present DRIVE v1.0, a data-driven framework to calculate road transport emissions based on a multi-modal macroscopic traffic model, vehicle class-specific traffic counting data from more than a hundred counting stations, and HBEFA emission factors. DRIVE introduces a novel approach for estimating traffic emissions with vehicle-specific temporal profiles in hourly resolution. In addition, we use traffic counting data to estimate the uncertainty of traffic activity and the resulting emission estimates at different temporal aggregation levels and with road link resolution. The framework was applied to the City of Munich, covering an area of 311 km2 and accounting for GHGs (CO2, CH4) and air pollutants (PM, CO, NOx). It captures irregular events such as COVID lockdowns and holiday periods well and is suitable for use in near real-time applications. Emission estimates for 2019–2022 are presented and differences in city totals and spatial distribution compared to the official municipal reported and national and European downscaled inventories are examined."

It directly impacts the local atmospheric conditions and the road surface temperature. These impacts are included in the numerical model of the Town Energy Balance, used to simulate local conditions in urbanised environments. Simulations show that road traffic has a significant impact on the road surface temperature up to a few degrees, and on local variables. 
 The impact of road traffic on local climate has often been overlooked, being modelled as an aggregated sensible heat flux released into the atmosphere, although it has multiple effects including turbulence, heat from energy inefficiencies of vehicles, tyre friction, snow compaction, and shadowing. These effects can impact road surface conditions and exacerbate the phenomenon of Urban Heat Island (UHI). This study aims to improve the representation of traffic impacts in the Town Energy Balance (TEB) V9.0 urban climate model. Particular attention has been paid to preserve physical consistency among the parameterisations of tyre friction, turbulence, energy inefficiencies, and radiation impacts of the road traffic within the model. In addition, a method has been developed to model the average engine efficiency of the entire automobile fleet with internal combustion engines (ICEs) using the Worldwide Harmonized Light vehicles Test Cycles (WLTC). The new parameterisations are evaluated using observations from two road weather stations in southern Finland, Nupuri and Palojärvi, which are characterised by clear commuting patterns. To evaluate the new traffic parameterisation, road surface temperature (RST) differences between the two road carriageways are used to isolate the traffic-induced effects from the natural factors. The results show that the new parameterisation is able to simulate the traffic-induced impacts on road surface temperatures. In addition, wind-induced impact and rolling friction have been shown to drive traffic effects on RST. Taking explicitly into account the traffic impacts might be better suited to simulate their actual impacts on the local scale."

Williams;Swen Metzger;Samuel Rémy;Vincent Huijnen;Johannes Flemming,An evaluation of the regional distribution and wet deposition of secondary inorganic aerosols and their gaseous precursors in IFS-COMPO preparatory to cycle 49R1,"One of the main constituents of Particulate Matter at the surface are Secondary Inorganic Aerosols (SIA) which are influenced by both anthropogenic emissions and the acidity of clouds and aerosols. This study shows improvements in introduced into the IFS-COMPO (Integrated Forecast System-COMPOsition) simulating the surface concentrations of SIA and the resulting changes in the total wet deposition for Europe, the US and South-East Asia. 
 Secondary Inorganic Aerosol (SIA) makes up a considerable fraction of the total particulate matter exposure and, thus, is an important product from any forecasting system of atmospheric composition and air quality. The subsequent loss to the surface of SIA via dry and wet deposition determines the duration of the exposure time for humans and the extent of acidification imposed on sensitive ecosystems. Here we provide a description and evaluation of the most recent updates made towards aerosol production, aerosol scavenging and wet deposition components of the global Integrated Forecast System-COMPOsition (IFS-COMPO) chemical forecasting system, which is used as part of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service. The implementation of the EQSAM4Clim simplified thermodynamic module in IFS-COMPO, for use in cycle 49R1, changes the efficacy of phase transfer of SIA precursor gases (sulphur dioxide, nitric acid and ammonia) which significantly impacts the respective SIA particulate concentrations by changing the fraction converted into SIA. Comparisons made against observational composites at the surface for Europe, the US, and Southeast Asia during 2018 show reductions in the global yearly mean bias statistics for both sulphates and nitrates. Updating the IFS-COMPO model towards cycle 49r1 increases both the burden and lifetime of sulphate and ammonium particles by one third. Coupling EQSAM4Clim into IFS-COMPO provides a better description of the partitioning between state phases involving ammonia and ammonium across regions, whereas changes for sulphate are minimal. For nitric acid and nitrates, the partitioning changes significantly, leading to lower particulate concentrations and a corresponding increase in gas-phase nitric acid with an associated improvement in surface nitrate. There is also a shift in the particle size distribution, with less nitrate production in the coarse mode and more in the fine mode. The impact on the total regional wet deposition values is generally positive, except for sulphates in the US and ammonium particles in Southeast Asia which are strongly influenced by the precursor emission estimates. This provides confidence that this update to IFS-COMPO has the ability to provide accurate deposition fluxes of S and N at global scale."

Traditional models struggle with accuracy, especially for heavy rain. Our model merges data from multiple forecasts, capturing detailed rainfall patterns and offering more reliable short-term predictions. 
 Accurate short-term quantitative precipitation forecasting (QPF) is critical for disaster prevention, mitigation, and socio-economic activities. However, due to the inherent limitations of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, precipitation forecasts still exhibit substantial inaccuracies. In recent years, deep learning (DL) techniques have been increasingly applied to improve precipitation forecasts, yet these approaches often produce overly smoothed outputs that fail to meet operational requirements for detail and accuracy. In this study, we propose a Generative Fusion Residual Network (GFRNet), a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework that integrates multi-source NWP forecasts to generate 3-hourly quantitative precipitation forecasts for North China up to 24 h in advance. GFRNet employs an adversarial learning mechanism to enhance spatial structure reconstruction, combined with a weighted loss function and carefully designed sampling strategies to address the long-tailed distribution of precipitation and improve model training efficiency. Using independent rainy-season datasets from 2022–2024, we comprehensively evaluate the performance of GFRNet against three NWP models, a linear ensemble method (MSEM), and a deep learning baseline model (FRNet). Results show that GFRNet consistently outperforms the NWPs and baseline models across light, moderate, and heavy rainfall thresholds. Compared to the China Meteorological Administration's highest-resolution regional model (CMA-3KM), GFRNet improves Threat Scores (TS) by 4 %, 28 %, 35 %, and 19 % at the 0.1, 10, 20, and 40 mm thresholds, respectively, and improves Fractions Skill Scores (FSS) by 13 %, 18 %, and 15 % at the 10, 20, and 40 mm thresholds. Moreover, GFRNet consistently achieves the highest Multi-Scale Structural Similarity (MS-SSIM) scores and significantly reduces RMSE, demonstrating robust spatial structure recovery, stable intensity control, and strong generalization ability. These advantages are particularly pronounced in systemic high-impact heavy rainfall events, underscoring the model's operational value. FRNet shows advantages in forecasting heavy precipitation but suffers from high BIAS and weaker generalization, limiting its practical applicability. MSEM exhibits robust performance in light and moderate precipitation scenarios but degrades significantly under extreme precipitation conditions. Overall, GFRNet dynamically fuses multi-source NWP information, balances precipitation intensity and spatial structure, achieves higher forecasting skill, and improves forecast quality across diverse precipitation regimes."

The growing Earth Observation (EO) record is the backbone of this multi‐scale system, providing local information with discrete coverage from surface measurements and regional information at global scale from satellites. Carbon flux information, anchored by inverse estimates from spaceborne Greenhouse Gas (GHG) concentrations, provides an important top‐down view of carbon emissions and sinks, but currently lacks global continuity at assessment and management scales (<100 km). Partial‐column data can help separate signals in the boundary layer from the overlying atmosphere, providing an opportunity to enhance surface sensitivity and bring flux resolution down from that of column‐integrated data (100–500 km). Based on a workshop held in September 2024, the carbon cycle community envisions a carbon observation system leveraging GHG partial columns in the lower and upper troposphere to weave together information across scales from surface and satellite EO data, and integration of top‐down/bottom‐up analyses to link process understanding to global assessment."

Despite this, there is substantial uncertainty about recent and ongoing changes in AR frequency and impacts. Here, we place recent observed trends in their longer‐term context using AR records extending back to 1940. Our results show that AR frequency has increased broadly across the midlatitudes, bridging the apparent discrepancy between the observed satellite‐era poleward shift and the general increase simulated in climate change projections. This increase in AR frequency enhances AR‐associated precipitation and snowfall across their region of influence in the mid‐ and high‐latitudes. We also find that, despite warmer surface temperatures associated with ARs, there is a decrease in the magnitude of AR‐associated temperature anomalies in high‐latitude regions due to Arctic amplification. An increase in AR‐associated humid heatwaves underscores the societal importance of changing AR activity."

Unlike isolated events such as the COVID‐19 lockdown, the Spring Festivals offer a more robust decade‐long (2015–2024) data set. Analysis of these observations reveals a striking shift in oxidant (Ox = O3 + NO2) response from negative to positive values over time despite similar emission reduction patterns each year. Chemical transport modeling indicates that meteorological factors are the primary drivers of these variations.

These findings challenge conventional assumptions about emission control effectiveness, showing that meteorological variability overrides expected chemical responses.

However, their spatial features remain unknown due to the radar narrow field‐of‐view. Here we report a case of localized BSL not accompanying plasma bubbles firstly observed by an all‐sky radar at low latitude. Based on radar interferometry over a large field‐of‐view, the BSL was revealed to occur over a limited area northeastward of the radar and did not cause scintillation when Global Navigation Satellite System satellites passed through. The BSL vertical displacement precisely followed the F‐layer bottom fluctuation, without obvious horizontal movement. Interestingly, the localized BSL caused weak spread‐F traces in the ionograms indicating irregularities from specific directions, which are distinct from the satellite traces or range spread F related to plasma bubble development thus could serve as a new signature of BSL in future studies."

For the first time, an experiment was designed to observe (open) ocean changes during AR precipitation, using profiling floats in the northeast subtropical Pacific. Results show upper ocean freshening and cooling with AR precipitation (lasting several hours), especially when surface winds are low (≈6 ${\approx} 6$ m/s). ARs contribute 70%–90% $\%$ of the total winter precipitation in the subtropical northeast Pacific: a salt budget analysis (using ECCO) shows that precipitation over winter is the main driver of ocean freshening in the top 25–30 m and contributes by ≈30% ${\approx} 30\%$ to the integrated changes in the top ≈55 ${\approx} 55$ m."

We evaluate GIM‐based corrections using phase ramps (planar functions fitted to interferograms) as proxies for long‐wavelength signals, enabling analysis of their temporal evolution.

Three factors primarily dominate the climatological SEB impact of ARs: surface type, season, and AR flavor. The largest anomalies occur during moisture‐dominated winter ARs over open ocean, where also the largest climatological contribution of ARs occurs. Conversely, the statistically rarest impact manifests in winter over sea ice."

Observations and numerical simulations reveal a robust polar–low‐latitude teleconnection: the March Arctic stratospheric polar vortex (ASPV) strongly modulates March–April compound dry–hot conditions across the region. When the March ASPV weakens, anomalous easterlies in the lower Arctic stratosphere induce corresponding tropospheric easterlies and persist through April, cooling Siberia and accelerating the mid‐latitude westerlies. The resulting anticyclonic shear drives an anomalous anticyclone over northern South and Southeast Asia. Combined with the region's climatologically dry–hot season, these processes promote compound dry–hot conditions further amplified by positive soil moisture–atmosphere feedback. Moreover, the March ASPV outweighs the preceding winter tropical sea surface temperature in shaping compound dry–hot variability in this northern sector.

Here, we assess the capability of the weather research and forecasting model, configured as a convection‐permitting model (CPM) to simulate MCS characteristics and 23‐year trends over East Asian monsoon region from 2001 to 2023 (June–September) by comparing with high‐resolution observational data. We employed an MCS tracking method PyFLEXTRKR, which can identify and track MCSs based on precipitation and brightness temperature. The CPM effectively captures key MCS characteristics, including lifetime, lifecycle total precipitation amount, and movement speed. However, it also has systematic biases: the model underestimates MCS size and meso‐α MCS frequency while overestimating meso‐β MCS occurrence and both mean and maximum MCSs precipitation intensities. Despite these biases, the model captures increasing (decreasing) trends in total and MCS precipitation over Manchuria and eastern China (Taiwan). In contrast, it struggles to reproduce observed total and MCS precipitation trends over North China Plain (NCP) and the Korean Peninsula (KP). These biases stem from the model's inability to capture enhanced moisture transport into East Asia, resulting in an underestimation of low‐level moisture over NCP and KP, as indicated by trends in vertically integrated moisture flux and 850 hPa specific humidity. By characterizing systematic and regional model biases, this study lays the groundwork for more reliable CPM‐based assessments of MCS responses to climate variability and change."

Recent studies report an anti‐Twomey phenomenon, where cloud droplet effective radius (Re) exhibits a positive correlation with aerosol optical depth (AOD), contrary to the classical Twomey effect. Using long‐term satellite and reanalysis data over East Asia, we found a strong positive Re‐AOD correlation. Further analysis reveals that AOD, as a column‐integrated quantity, lacks aerosol vertical information and cannot fully represent cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), potentially misleading the interpretation of the Twomey effect. Consequently, we analyzed aerosol vertical profiles and introduced a metric, Elevated Aerosol Ratio (EAratio), defined as the ratio of aerosol concentration integrals above and below clouds. Higher EAratio values correlated with a stronger anti‐Twomey phenomenon, while lower values aligned with the classical Twomey effect. Notably, the anti‐Twomey phenomenon primarily appeared under low liquid water path (LWP) conditions: as LWP increased, both the anti‐Twomey phenomenon and the influence of EAratio diminished. Moreover, the marine anti‐Twomey phenomenon is linked to pollution. Elevated aerosol layers in heavily polluted nearshore areas—driven by anthropogenic emissions and atmospheric dispersion—distort the Re‐AOD relationship. Additionally, while coarse aerosols suppress marine anti‐Twomey phenomenon, the EAratio‐based analysis remains valid when excluding their influence as much as possible. Our findings demonstrate that the observed anti‐Twomey phenomenon is primarily a statistical artifact arising from the lack of vertical co‐location between aerosols and clouds. This mismatch biases the satellite‐based quantification of the Twomey effect when column‐integrated AOD is used as a proxy for CCN."

This study investigates the dynamics and energetics of TCs that underwent RI and non‐RI in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) from 2005 to 2023. Eulerian and quasi‐Lagrangian frameworks were employed to study the energetics of TCs. Results reveal that the quasi‐Lagrangian captures the intensity and its variabilities more robustly during RI than the Eulerian framework, particularly highlighting the rapid increase in EKE (Eddy Kinetic Energy). Energy budget analysis shows that warm BoB regions serve as primary energy sources for RI, with the baroclinic conversion term emerging as the dominant driver of EKE during intensification. Additionally, the study shows that RI and non‐RI TC trajectories are statistically distinct, with RI TCs showing more northward movement and non‐RI TCs predominantly moving westward. Analysis of composite sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies reveals correlations with RI TC tracks, indicating a positive anomaly during RI phases. RI events are associated with more negative Surface Latent Heat Flux anomalies along the cyclone track, suggesting more substantial ocean‐to‐atmosphere heat transfer. Moreover, RI TCs experience weaker vertical wind shear than non‐RI events, further supporting RI. These distinctions underscore the relevance of RI and the role of energetics emphasizing the importance of baroclinic conversion in driving cyclone intensification. This comparative analysis between these frameworks sheds light on the complexities of cyclone energetics and accentuates the quasi‐Lagrangian framework's efficacy in capturing subtle yet critical variations in RI dynamics."

Using high‐resolution atmospheric turbulence observations from relatively uniform flat terrain, Horqin station, this study identified four distinct regimes through spectral analysis, each representing different impacts of submesoscale motions and turbulence intermittency. Regime 1 conforms to the classical energy spectrum. Regime 2, dominated by submesoscale motions that lead to large‐scale intermittency, occurs most frequent (>70%). Regime 3, characterized by deviations in the inertial subrange, suggest small‐scale intermittency. Regime 4, where the full‐range energy spectrum departs from the classical form, implying full‐scale intermittency. Marked differences are observed in the turbulence time series characteristics and the performance of similarity relationships across the four regimes. Revised surface‐layer similarity relationships are established under Regimes 2 and 4 by removing submesoscale motions with a Hilbert‐Huang transform‐based separation, encompassing the connections among the normalized velocity and temperature standard deviations (ϕu,ϕv,ϕw,ϕθ ${\phi }_{u},{\phi }_{v},{\phi }_{w},{\phi }_{\theta }$), the flux‐profile functions (ϕm,ϕh ${\phi }_{m},{\phi }_{h}$), and the stability parameter z/L $z/L$. In this filtered framework, countergradient transport is substantially reduced, and the positive skill scores demonstrate that the new formulations achieve significant improvements. Furthermore, an empirical parameterization relationship is proposed linking the dimensionless submesoscale wind speed standard deviations to the bulk Richardson number, with validation from five independent data sets demonstrating its robustness and applicability. These findings provide both methodological and theoretical foundations for improving boundary layer turbulence representation in high‐resolution atmospheric models."

Perturbed Physics Experiments,"Accurate representation of mesoscale cellular convective (MCC) cloud morphology over the Southern Ocean is essential for improving climate model parametrizations and reducing projection uncertainties given their highly variable radiative impacts. In this study, we investigate three potential drivers of the organization and transition from closed‐to open‐cell MCC clouds over the Southern Ocean under post‐frontal conditions: (a) sea surface temperature (SST) including its gradients, (b) cloud ice production processes, and (c) microphysical latent cooling. Using a convection‐permitting configuration of the WRF model and building on findings from Part I, we evaluate how each driver shapes the morphological evolution of MCCs. Perturbed physics experiments reveal that while SST is not the primary driver of the closed‐to‐open MCCs transition, it influences cloud cellular morphology in two ways: warmer SST deepens the boundary layer and enhances precipitation, whereas colder SST suppresses boundary layer mixing, leading to reduced cloud cover. Enhanced ice production plays a key role in MCCs organization, driving cloud “break‐up” by increasing precipitation formation. Cloud evaporative cooling significantly affects MCCs organization, likely by affecting negative cloud buoyancy, allowing clouds to grow deeper and drying the boundary layer. These findings highlight critical processes that govern MCCs behavior and provide valuable insights for improving the representation of shallow clouds in climate models, ultimately aiding efforts to reduce uncertainties in climate sensitivity projections."

High‐frequency DHR events depend on strong temperature‐VPD (>0.6) and temperature‐solar radiation coupling (>0.5).

There is evidence from both high‐resolution climate modeling and natural analogs that the introduction of aerosols in the Arctic atmosphere leads to cloud brightening. This study is the first comparison of Arctic MCB using multiple Earth System Models (ESMs). All three models suggest that SSA injection induces cloud and sky brightening that can substantially cool the Arctic. However, uncertainties in aerosol‐cloud interactions mean that the SSA mass required for cooling varies greatly between models, a feature which was also found for injections at lower latitudes. We evaluate a possible Arctic MCB scenario in which SSA injection is scaled up over time to maintain near present‐day annual‐mean Arctic surface air temperature under a moderate greenhouse gas emissions scenario. The MCB cooling of the Arctic successfully maintains Arctic sea ice and, in contrast to our expectation that cooling one hemisphere leads to the large tropical rainfall shifts, we do not see robust precipitation changes outside of the Arctic. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is also shown to be maintained but we caution that not all processes driving the AMOC are represented in these ESMs. Finally, we emphasize that we idealize aspects of the SSA injection in these simulations and we do not consider the technical or governance feasibility of deploying Arctic MCB, nor the impacts on coastal communities, ecosystems, and atmospheric chemistry."

While previous studies agree on the projected changes in intensity and frequency of precipitation extremes, there is a lack of consensus regarding how their size will change in response to an increase in radiative forcing. Moreover, the influence of different downscaling techniques on their characteristics has not been thoroughly examined. This study employs an ensemble of high‐resolution projections derived from six CMIP6 GCMs, using dynamical, statistical and artificial intelligence based downscaling techniques and two reference observations. Overall, we find noticeable differences in the size, average depth, and total precipitation volume of these storms among the climate ensembles in the historical period. Despite these differences in the historical period, we find consistent future changes across various ensembles. We find a robust projected increase in storm size during Winter and Spring but a decrease in size during Summer in the East. Nevertheless, irrespective of changes in their size, extreme storms are projected to intensify across all the ensembles and seasons."

Simpson,"Observed and Modeled Amplification of the Frequency, Duration, and Extreme Heat Impacts of the Pacific Trough Regime","The large‐scale atmospheric circulation is a key driver for regional climate extremes, yet its response to anthropogenic forcing remains uncertain. The Pacific trough (PT) regime is a persistent circulation pattern modulating temperature, precipitation, and fires over North America. We show that the observed boreal winter‐spring (December to May) PT frequency and duration have increased significantly over the past 76 years, contributing to amplified extreme anomalous heat over western and central Canada. These observed changes are not well represented in the climate simulations analyzed herein. However, our results indicate that rising greenhouse gas concentrations likely contribute to increased winter‐spring PT frequency, which is further modulated by sea surface temperatures (SSTs). While the recent La Niña‐like and negative Pacific Decadal Oscillation‐like SST trends have dampened this increase, our results suggest that if an eventual emergence of the modeled El Niño‐like response to elevated CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ were to occur in reality, it would reinstate the increase in PT frequency, duration, and downstream amplification of regional extreme heat. However, the occurrence, timing, and magnitude of this shift remain uncertain, given the complex, interlaced role of external forcings and internal variability in modulating historical trends, as well as models' inability to reproduce them. Additionally, modeling decisions regarding future trajectories for anthropogenic emissions, including aerosols and greenhouse gases, play a critical role in projecting future changes in PT frequency.

While droughts are typically temporary events, persistent or recurrent droughts can indicate a transition toward aridification, that is, a gradual shift to drier conditions. We assessed how temporal changes in water supply and demand at multiple time scales affect vegetation productivity and land cover changes in continental Chile to diagnose the region's climate trajectory from drought to aridification. Since 2000, much of the region has seen a continuous decrease in water supply alongside a rise in atmospheric water demand. Further, in water‐limited ecoregions, evapotranspiration, likely reflecting reduced transpiration or vegetation cover, has declined over time, with this trend intensifying over longer time scales. A long‐term decline in water availability and shifting demand have led to declining vegetation productivity, especially in the Chilean Matorral and the Patagonia Steppe ecoregions. We discovered a link between these declines and drought indices related to soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration at time scales of up to 12 months. Further, our results indicate that the trends in drought indices account for up to 78% of shrubland and 40% of forest area changes across all ecoregions. The most important variable explaining cropland changes is the burned area. Our findings suggest that Chile is undergoing a transition from episodic drought to aridification, underscoring the need for adaptation strategies aligned with this emerging baseline."

 Observations have demonstrated the ubiquity of short-lived halogens (SLHs)—defined as organic and inorganic chlorine, bromine and iodine compounds with an overall atmospheric lifetime of less than 6 months—in the global atmosphere. They are primarily emitted naturally from the ocean, cryosphere, volcanoes, salt lakes and the biosphere. However, unregulated anthropogenic sources are increasingly contributing to their atmospheric loading. Some of their natural emissions have increased over time due to anthropogenic pollution, for example, the increased oceanic emissions of iodine compounds due to the deposition of ozone on the sea surface. SLHs affect chemical processes, such as ozone and methane chemistry, and therefore influence air quality and climate. Nevertheless, some of their sources and chemistry are not included in air-quality and climate models used in international assessment reports. Here we describe in detail the various impacts of SLHs on air quality and climate, and make a case for the inclusion of more comprehensive SLH chemistry in future atmospheric, air-quality and climate assessments. In doing so, we also identify gaps in our knowledge of SLH emissions, chemistry, and environmental and climate impacts.

 Since 1980, tropical cyclones have migrated poleward, but it remains unclear whether this trend reflects long-term climate change or temporary climate variability. Here we investigate the drivers of this poleward migration using multiple observational datasets and global models that permit tropical cyclones. We show that a tripolar pattern of Pacific sea surface temperature variability strongly modulates the interannual variation of cyclone latitudes and largely drove the poleward migration over 1980–2024. The tripolar pattern influences tropical cyclones more effectively than either the El Niño/Southern Oscillation or the Hadley circulation. When its effects are removed, poleward migration is negligible. When it shows negative trends, the model simulates equatorward migration. As the pattern exhibits alternating multi-decadal trends but no long-term trend since 1970, its recent trend—and the associated poleward migration—is unlikely to persist. In ensemble projections under a warming scenario, tropical cyclone activity decreases overall, leading to fewer occurrences at high latitudes despite the poleward expansion of the Hadley cell. These results indicate that climate variability has played a dominant role in the observed poleward migration of tropical cyclones, and that future changes may differ markedly from the recent multi-decadal trends.

 China’s rapidly expanding cooling sector is a major driver of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and rising electricity demand, with profound implications for national decarbonization goals and global climate targets. Using a bottom-up, scenario-based model, we quantify direct refrigerant-related and indirect energy-related emissions across four subsectors: room air conditioning, mobile air conditioning, commercial air conditioning, and cold-chain refrigeration. Compared with a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario for 2022–2060, an accelerated transition to low-GWP refrigerants and enhanced energy efficiency (ATE) is projected to reduce cumulative HFC consumption by 12.6 ± 0.4 Gt CO2-eq, with 70% of these reductions achieved through compliance with the Kigali Amendment compliance and the remainder from faster adoption. The ATE pathway would also avoid 4.1 Gt CO2— ~ 28% of total avoided GHG emissions—along with substantial reductions in SO2 (1.8 Gt), NOx (3.7 Gt), and PM2.5 (0.3 Gt), lowering global mean temperature by up to 0.015°C by 2060.

 Understanding the interannual variability of summer precipitation across the Central-Eastern Himalayas (CEH) is essential for guiding efficient water management and supporting socio-economic development in South Asia. However, the mechanisms through which climate variability shapes CEH summer precipitation variability remain insufficiently understood. Summer precipitation in the CEH is modulated by multiple climate factors, with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation as a sustained weak force and the summer North Atlantic Oscillation (SNAO) exerting non-stationary effects. The SNAO can trigger an anomalous anticyclone over South Asia, directing low-level winds toward the Himalayas’ southern slopes, inducing precipitation anomalies through topographic mechanical forcing. The position shift of the SNAO-driven anomalous anticyclone to the south of the CEH modulates the coupled and decoupled relationship between SNAO and CEH summer precipitation variability. Therefore, understanding the dynamic links between the SNAO and CEH summer precipitation is key to enhancing precipitation prediction accuracy."

 Measurements of pre-industrial conditions are of paramount importance for understanding historical climate change.

Alkylamines can rapidly partition into aerosols, increasing their mass, as well as form new particles altogether. We demonstrate the importance of pelagic “open ocean” (OO) and sympagic “sea ice” (SI) regions in supplying distinct organic nitrogen aerosol components. In the aerosol phase, dimethylamine (DMA) and trimethylamine (TMA) are both secondary, though DMA likely originates mainly from pelagic regions, while TMA is associated mainly with sympagic regions. Parallel measurements in ice and surface waters reveal that melting sea ice contains a factor of four more TMA than coastal Antarctic Peninsula waters; and seventeen times more TMA than OO regions - suggesting additional coastal Antarctic sources.

 Tibetan Plateau (TP) is a sensitive region of climate change, with its precipitation change attracting considerable scientific attention. This study couples dynamical downscaling simulation with the storyline attribution approach to investigate the impact of regional climate change over East Asia (RCC) and TP (PCC) on the sub-daily precipitation over TP. RCC significantly reduces overall precipitation, mainly through decreased morning and stratiform precipitation, but enhances afternoon precipitation by increasing convective precipitation. Furthermore, RCC reduces the precipitation frequency and precipitation intensity, most substantially for morning stratiform precipitation. PCC exerts smaller and less statistically significant impact on precipitation than RCC. The opposing morning–afternoon effects of RCC stem from differing physical mechanisms: RCC stabilizes the atmosphere and reduces moisture in the morning, suppressing convection, while it enhances instability, moisture, and convective energy in the afternoon. Regional differences in RCC-induced precipitation changes are attributed to variations in moisture flux and atmospheric dynamics."

 Entrainment rate parameterization is important for convection schemes but uncertain in climate models. A new deep convective entrainment rate (λ) parameterization (HL parameterization) is developed from aircraft observations and implemented into the convection scheme (Song and Zhang, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1002/2017MS001191) in the Community Integrated Earth System Model version 1.1.0, replacing the previously used parameterization (Gregory parameterization). Compared with the Gregory parameterization, the HL parameterization simulates overall larger λ values and improves convective and large-scale precipitation simulations in the 30°S-30°N region, agreeing better with observations. The mechanism is that the HL parameterization suppresses deep convective cloud development macrophysically and microphysically compared with the Gregory parameterization. Indirectly, compared with the Gregory parameterization, the HL parameterization increases large-scale precipitation and reduces shallow convective precipitation, lowering total precipitation closer to observations. The HL parameterization enhances the model’s ability to simulate precipitation, providing a valuable reference for improving the deep convection scheme in climate models."

 According to the scientific consensus, tropical convection must decrease with global warming. This decrease is manifested by a decrease of the mass transported in the upward branch of the atmospheric overturning circulation – the convective mass flux – and a connected decrease of high clouds in the tropics, with implications for climate sensitivity. By using kilometer-scale simulations in radiative-convective equilibrium and a convective tracking algorithm, we show that no such decrease occurs in storms when taken individually and that the mass transport per storm increases instead. Storms can achieve this result by aggregating more surface of the convective cores – the inner part of the storm doing the vertical transport – so that the decrease of tropical convection is actually explained by a decrease in the total number of storms. There is little variation of the mean pressure velocity in the cores of the storms, a robust finding of this study. This remarkable invariance of the mean pressure velocity points to an emerging property of convection that should receive more attention in future studies."

 Accurate precipitation forecasting often relies on high-resolution numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, which are essential for capturing fine-scale and nonlinear atmospheric dynamics. However, the computational demands of these models can be substantial. Leveraging recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), we present a stretched-grid AI-driven weather model with 6-km horizontal grid increments over the Western United States and ~31 km in other regions globally. The model employs an autoregressive framework to generate forecasts in minutes and is evaluated against global and regional NWP systems, as well as a lower-resolution AI model. Our results show that the regional AI model reduces 24-h accumulated precipitation errors, performs competitively with the regional NWP model, and effectively captures extreme precipitation events, particularly those linked to atmospheric rivers, which global coarser models often underestimate. This work underscores the potential of regional, high-resolution AI models for precipitation forecasting at km-scales, and discusses some of the challenges for future development."

 Hydrocarbon seeps release fossil methane into the marine environment, but emission of this seep-derived methane to the atmosphere is challenging to constrain. Here, we measure the concentration and radiocarbon content of dissolved methane in seawater above seeps in the northern Gulf of Mexico that have previously been linked to considerable atmospheric emissions. In bottom waters above the seeps, methane radiocarbon content is close to zero, confirming the release of fossil seep methane. However, radiocarbon signatures approach modern values at shallower depths, indicating that only ~21% of the methane in surface waters is sourced from seeps. We observe a mid-depth methane concentration maximum and radiocarbon minimum at ~200 m below the surface, but this likely reflects lateral advection of fossil methane from shallower seep fields. Our findings are consistent with previous radiocarbon fingerprinting in coastal regions, and suggest that seeps deeper than ~400 m are not a major contributor to atmospheric methane emissions.

 Sea-level rise poses a significant threat to Africa’s vital coastal ecosystems and the livelihoods of its growing populations. Here we analyze 31 years of satellite altimetry data to quantify sea-level change across Africa’s Large Marine Ecosystems, vast ocean regions of high biological productivity. The rate of rise has accelerated markedly to 4.34 mm/yr since 2010, over four times the 1990s rate. This is primarily driven by two factors: an increase in ocean mass from melting ice sheets accounts for over 80% of the total rise, with the remainder reflecting the expansion of warming ocean water. Regional rates are fastest in the Red Sea and Guinea Current, while increased salinity suppresses the trend in the Mediterranean. 2023 was particularly severe, with record-high sea levels across nearly 40% of Africa’s surrounding ocean. This uneven rise intensifies risks for over 50 million coastal residents, underscoring the urgent need for region-specific adaptation.

Grimalt;Barend L. Van Drooge,"Origin, transport and processing of organic aerosols at different altitudes in coastal Mediterranean urban areas","Distance changes air pollution in a city, but so does the time of the day and the year, due to varying emission sources and weather conditions. These changes were studied at ground level and 400 meters above the city, and showed that wood burning affected the air quality in winter, while products of atmospheric reaction processes dominated the air in summer. Traffic emissions arrive to the elevated site during the day, while they were trapped at lower level in the night. 
 Organic molecular markers in atmospheric PM10 were analysed by off-line GC-MS techniques in an urban background site (81 m above sea level (a.s.l.)) and in a nearby elevated sub-urban background site (415 ma.s.l.), in cold and warm periods in Barcelona; situated in the Western Mediterranean Basin. Previous studies reported similar PM concentrations and substantial organic matter contributions in both sites but did not analyze the organic molecular composition, which is expected to vary within the city's vertical airshed due to a weakening influence of local emission sources and enhanced influence of regional air masses. Multi-variant analysis of organic molecular marker concentrations, together with major air quality parameters (NO, NO2, O3, PM10), resolved six components that represented primary emissions sources and secondary organic aerosol formation processes: (1) diurnal traffic, (2) nocturnal traffic, (3) biomass burning, (4) biogenic with primary and secondary organic markers, (5) fresh secondary, and (6) regional secondary. Urban traffic emissions reached the elevated site during daytime through the sea-mountain breeze, while nocturnal traffic emissions accumulated in the nighttime urban atmosphere, when the two sites were often disconnected by temperature inversions. Biomass burning, dominant in the cold period, was the main contributor to toxic PAHs in these two background sites. Regional secondary organic aerosol contribution was more abundant in the elevated background site. Several SOA formation mechanisms were identified such as the oxidation of traffic emissions by NOx, the aqueous-phase oxidation under high relative humidity, and formation of fresh SOA under conditions of low relative humidity."

Model-observation comparisons emphasize the critical role of aerosol entrainment in reproducing the observed broad cloud droplet spectra. This study provides valuable constraints for improving parameterizations of aerosol-cloud interactions in deep convective systems. 
 The accurate representation of aerosol physicochemical properties is important when describing aerosol–cloud interactions. The Deep Convective Microphysics Experiment (DCMEX) aimed to improve the representation of microphysical processes in deep convective systems. As part of this project, an airborne campaign (July to August 2022) was conducted to characterize the thermodynamics–dynamic–aerosol–cloud system over the isolated Magdalena Mountains in New Mexico, US. Backward dispersion analyses identified a transition in dominant airmass origins from Northwest (NW) continental to Southeast (SE) aged oceanic flow, coinciding with substantial changes in meteorological conditions and aerosol characteristics. The SE-flow period generally exhibited lower lifting condensation levels, enhanced convection, higher boundary layer humidity, and more frequent and intense precipitation, compared to the NW-flow period. During the SE-flow period, aerosol size distributions showed a more pronounced bimodality, characterized by increased Aitken-mode concentrations and fewer but larger accumulation-mode particles, indicating enhanced cloud processing. Submicron aerosols exhibited larger sulfate fractions, more oxidized organics, and greater hygroscopicity. Correspondingly, clouds presented larger droplet sizes and liquid water contents. A bin-microphysics parcel model was also employed to simulate the development of cloud droplets, constrained by airborne observations. Model-observation comparisons highlight the critical role of aerosol entrainment in reproducing the observed broad cloud droplet spectra extending toward small sizes. The results underscore the combined influence of meteorological conditions and aerosol characteristics on cloud microphysics under different flow regimes and emphasize the importance of aerosol entrainment in the development of deep convective clouds. This study provides valuable constraints for improving parameterizations of aerosol–cloud interactions in convective systems."

It substantially enhances aerosol and surface characterization from spaceborne measurements. The approach can be extended to future missions, including synergy with multi-angular, multi-spectral, and polarimetric measurements. 
 Atmospheric aerosol is one of the main drivers of climate change.  Currently, a number of different satellites in Earth orbit are dedicated to aerosol studies. Due to limited information content, the primary aerosol product of most satellite missions is AOD (Aerosol Optical Depth), while the accuracy of aerosol size and type retrieval from spaceborne remote sensing still requires improvement. Combining measurements from different satellites increases their information content and, therefore, can provide new possibilities for retrieving an extended set of both aerosol and surface properties.In this paper, we present the physical basis and concept of the recently developed synergetic approach for aerosol and surface characterization using diverse spaceborne measurements (hereinafter SYREMIS (SYnergetic REtrieval from Multi-MISsion instruments) approach). The approach was implemented in the GRASP (Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties) algorithm and has been tested on two types of synergetic measurements: (i) synergy of polar-orbiting satellites (LEO + LEO synergy combining Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI, Sentinel-3A/OLCI, and Sentinel-3B/OLCI instruments), (ii) synergy of polar-orbiting and geostationary satellites (LEO + GEO synergy based on Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI, Sentinel-3A/OLCI, Sentinel-3B/OLCI, and Himawari-8/AHI instruments). On the one hand, such a synergetic satellite constellation extends the spectral range of the measurements. On the other hand, it provides unprecedented global spatial coverage with high temporal resolution, which is crucial for a number of climate studies. It is shown that the SYREMIS/GRASP approach facilitates the transfer of information content from instruments with richer information content to those with lower one. This results in substantial enhancements in aerosol and surface characterization for all instruments within the synergy."

It improves on its predecessor with higher spatial resolution (0.25° vs. 0.75°), enhancing topographic and land cover detail. The product’s performance is assessed in terms of snow depth and cover compared to in situ observations and satellite data. The findings show a notable improvement, though remaining biases appear in boreal forests, where snow–forest interactions are not captured. 
 This article provides an overview of the daily Crocus–ERA5 snow product covering the Northern Hemisphere from 1950 to 2022. It assesses the product's performance in terms of snow depth and cover compared to in situ observations and satellite data. Compared to its predecessor, Crocus-ERA-Interim, Crocus–ERA5 benefits from improved spatial resolution and better atmospheric data assimilation, resulting in more accurate snowpack estimates, especially during spring in Eurasia. The findings show a good match with observations, though biases remain, particularly in some Arctic regions, where the model tends to overestimate spring melt. In low-vegetation areas such as tundra, Crocus–ERA5 may introduce biases due to its limited consideration of interannual vegetation changes, leading to inaccuracies in the simulation of snowmelt. The production of this snow dataset responds to the request of the continental cryosphere community. In particular the French and Canadian government institutions CNRM (National Center for Meteorological Research) and ECCC (Environment and Climate Change Canada) have been involved in monitoring Arctic snow cover as part of the ”Terrestrial Snow” section of the Arctic Report Card since 2017. The Crocus–ERA5 product is freely available on a daily basis and at 0.25° resolution over the 1 July 1950 to 30 June 2023 period (Decharme et al., 2024, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14513248)."

The spectral detail enables precise identification of UV absorption characteristics and atmospheric interactions previously obscured in conventional broadband measurements. These results provide new capabilities for monitoring ozone depletion, and optimizing solar energy systems across China's diverse climatic regions. 
 Solar ultraviolet radiation (UV) plays a fundamental role in the Earth's energy balance, influencing a wide range of processes, including material degradation, biophysical reactions, ecological dynamics, or public health. In this context, the first high-resolution (10×10 km) hourly dataset of surface solar UV under clear-sky conditions over mainland China from 1981 to 2023 is introduced, derived from ERA5 and MERRA2 reanalysis data and a reconstruction based on the SMARTS (Simple Model of the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer of Sunshine) spectral model. Leveraging the SMARTS model's accuracy and capabilities, this dataset provides UV data at 0.5 nm intervals between 280 and 400 nm, offering enhanced granularity for wavelength-specific analysis, thus filling a key gap in high-resolution hourly UV data for China. Validation of the UV dataset against ground observations at 37 stations of the Chinese Ecosystem Research Network (CERN) demonstrates strong performance, with a correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean bias error (MBE) of 0.919, 5.07 W m−2 and −0.07 W m−2, respectively. Compared with the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) UV product, this dataset offers higher spatial and temporal resolution as well as higher accuracy in comparison with observations, thus enhancing data quality for a wide range of applications. The spatial and temporal distribution of clear-sky UV radiation exhibits distinct regional and seasonal variations, with higher values in the west and south, and lower values in the east and north. Over the past 43 years, the annual mean clear-sky broadband UV radiation averaged over China was 20.05 W m−2, showing a slightly increasing trend (+0.0237 W m−2 yr−1). This dataset is now available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28234298 (Qi et al., 2025), offering a valuable resource for addressing regional challenges related to UV radiation."

Additionally, droughts during El Niño events significantly lower the GWL, the main environmental factor that controls greenhouse gas (GHG; carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane) emissions in peatlands. Consequently, tropical peatlands have been recognized as a significant source of carbon emissions, and these emissions have been estimated for the region using constant decomposition rates of peat for each land use (Tier 1 emission factors). However, these factors hardly reflect the spatiotemporal variation of the GWL. Furthermore, these estimates do not account for CO2 uptake through photosynthesis. To reduce uncertainty, we developed a method to estimate spatiotemporal GWL variation from satellite‐derived antecedent precipitation. Using the estimated GWL, we calculated the monthly net ecosystem‐scale GHG emissions from peat forests and managed peatlands using the observed relationship between eddy covariance GHG fluxes and GWL, though carbon losses from deforestation, fires, and fluvial export were not covered in this study. Spatiotemporal variations in GHG emissions across Sumatra, Borneo, and the Malay Peninsula over a decade revealed the following: (a) Peat forests are a net source of CO2‐equivalent GHGs, even when undrained, (b) Decadal mean annual GHG emission rates increase 2.8‐fold when forests are drained and 6.4‐fold when undrained forests are converted to managed peatlands, (c) Droughts increase total annual GHG emissions by 16% across the study area. Additionally, climate models projected precipitation increase in the mid‐21st century, suggesting an increase in GWL and a consequent reduction in peat decomposition."

Here we analyze 15–27 years of precipitable water vapor (PWV) from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and co‐located rain gauges across southwestern South America. The strength of PWV–precipitation coupling varies systematically with latitude and precipitation regime: high‐elevation convective regions show strong coupling across timescales, while extratropical areas dominated by stratiform precipitation exhibit weaker annual and monthly but moderate daily relationships. Seasonal PWV ranges from ∼ ${\sim} $40 mm in the tropics to ∼ ${\sim} $6 mm in subpolar regions, yet precipitation varies inversely. Probability distributions reveal a power‐law PWV–precipitation relationship only in the tropical Andes, whereas extratropical regions follow a logistic form shaped by positively skewed PWV."

The aerosol surface area distribution near the tropopause (12.47 ± 1 km) exhibited bimodal peaks at ∼0.2 and ∼2.21 μm, differing from the typical unimodal Asian tropopause aerosol layer. Backward trajectory calculations demonstrate that a dust storm over Middle East and northeastern Africa around 24 March transported dust from the lower troposphere to the UT, strongly influencing the observed aerosol profile in Golmud.

Marsh vulnerability was assessed using the Unvegetated‐to‐Vegetated Ratio (UVVR) and relative marsh elevation (Z*). We identified two thresholds: SSC >20 mg/L and RSLR <5.2 mm/year. Marshes meeting either threshold tended to remain intact, while those with both low SSC and high RSLR were more vulnerable to degradation.

 An accurate assessment of black carbon (BC) climate and health impacts requires knowledge of its mass absorption cross-section (MACBC) – a parameter linking optical and mass measurements. The mean MACBC for freshly emitted soot typically spans a narrow range of 8 ± 1 m2 g⁻1 at 550 nm1,2 but is modified by subsequent atmospheric aging. Determination of MACBC requires simultaneous measurements of aerosol light-absorption coefficient (βabs) and BC mass. Here, we compile 230 measured MACBC values from 80 atmospheric studies and explore the effects of sampling location, study duration, instrumentation, and measurement wavelength. The compiled data set shows a broad variability in MACBC values (a factor of about 200%). We conclude that this variability is attributable to a combination of the above-mentioned effects with additional instrumental uncertainties (e.g., cross-sensitivities and/or inadequate instrument calibration). The current state of knowledge does not support the use of simplistic generalizations or assumptions about MACBC in the atmosphere, motivating a recommendation to further improve and standardize measurement practices."

However, standard LIMs struggle to simulate the observed asymmetry and diversity of ENSO events. Observations reveal that strong Central Pacific (CP) La Niñas and extreme Eastern Pacific (EP) El Niños occur more frequently than their counterparts, a feature standard LIMs fail to capture. We introduce a modified model, the Non‐Gaussian LIM (NG‐LIM), which transforms the LIM variables to better simulate ENSO asymmetry and diversity. Specifically, the NG‐LIM reproduces the spatial pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) skewness and the inverted U‐shaped relationship between the first two principal components of Tropical Pacific SST anomalies, reflecting more frequent strong CP La Niñas and extreme EP El Niños. NG‐LIM simulations also show El Niños that are stronger and evolve more rapidly than La Niñas. This improved inverse model generates synthetic events to supplement the limited observational record."

Miller,Spatial and Temporal Distribution of Global Wetland Methane Emissions During 2019–2020 Estimated From Satellite Observations,"Wetlands are the largest natural source of methane, yet bottom‐up models and top‐down models do not agree on global wetland methane emissions. In this study, we use TROPOMI methane data and inverse modeling to estimate the spatial and temporal distribution of global wetland methane emissions during the years 2019–2020 and compare inverse modeling results with an ensemble of 16 bottom‐up wetland models from the Global Carbon Project (GCP). We find that our inverse model increases wetland methane emissions near the equator (0° ${}^{\circ}$–15° ${}^{\circ}$) by 7% and decreases emissions in mid‐ and high‐latitude regions (31° ${}^{\circ}$–90° ${}^{\circ}$) by 26% compared to the mean of the GCP models. We also find that our inverse modeling estimate exhibits little seasonality in wetland methane emissions across most tropical wetland regions, even when emissions estimates within the prior include seasonality. This result is consistent with some bottom‐up models but not others. For mid‐ and high‐latitude wetland regions (e.g., the West Siberian lowland and Hudson Bay Great Lakes region), the seasonality of our inverse emissions estimate is consistent with most GCP models and suggests wetland methane emissions peak in July. Furthermore, we argue that an inundation map with accurate seasonality is a prerequisite for obtaining a bottom‐up methane emission estimate with appropriate seasonality. Overall, many of the bottom‐up models examined in this study agree with the magnitude and seasonality of the inverse model in major wetland regions, but there are nonetheless many opportunities to improve convergence between the bottom‐up and top‐down estimates."

The global EDVI‐GPP model incorporates the effect of diffuse radiation from clouds on GPP and utilizes the Shuffled Complex Evolution‐University of Arizona (SCE‐UA) algorithm to tune its key parameters of light use efficiency and the seasonality of the vegetation water content index. In situ GPP measurements from 163 eddy covariance flux sites covering 10 major ecosystem types around the globe are used to calibrate and validate the model performance. EDVI‐GPP provides daily temporal resolution GPP estimations applicable under both clear and cloudy skies. At 8‐day temporal resolution, the coefficients of determination between EDVI‐GPP and in situ GPP measurements (R2 = 0.51) during 2020–2022 are comparable to several mainstream GPP products (FLUXCOM‐GPP, MODIS‐GPP, GLASS‐GPP, PML‐GPP, and GOSIF‐GPP), with a reduced bias of −0.46 gC m−2 day−1. On a global scale, the annual‐averaged EDVI‐GPP exhibits high spatial consistency (R = 0.71–0.74) with the compared GPP products. The EDVI‐GPP model quantifies the mean global GPP as 123.77 ± 1.33 Pg C yr−1 from 2020 to 2022, which is in close agreement with other published estimates. By using the three‐cornered hat (TCH) method to evaluate GPP uncertainty, we find that EDVI‐GPP exhibits a large uncertainty in agricultural areas. This research incorporates microwave‐derived variables into daily GPP estimation on a global scale, providing a less cloud‐affected and reliable measurement."

Holland;Zhen‐Qiang Zhou;Yao Yao;Yurong Hou;Xichen Li,Surface Warming Over Greenland Amplified by Remote Forcing From Tropical Atlantic,"During the satellite era, Greenland's surface air temperature has experienced a rapid warming trend, potentially lengthening the melting season and enhancing surface melting, contributing to ice mass loss. While previous studies have primarily attributed this warming to greenhouse gas forcing, regional feedbacks, and remote forcing from the tropical Pacific, the role of the Atlantic Ocean remains less explored. Using both observations and numerical model simulations, this study identifies an atmospheric teleconnection pattern triggered by tropical North Atlantic (TNA) sea surface temperature (SST) variability, which significantly contributes to surface warming over Greenland. This teleconnection exhibits strong seasonality, with a more pronounced connection during boreal winter and spring. Anomalous TNA warming initiates a poleward‐propagating Rossby wave train, inducing regional circulation adjustments that intensify thermal and moisture advection to Greenland. Enhanced downward long‐wave radiation, associated with these moisture changes, further amplifies the warming trend. These findings provide valuable insights into the warming of Greenland and, by extension, its potential implications for global sea level rise. Moreover, the identified teleconnection may improve the predictability and future projections of Greenland's climate."

To address methodological limitations causing Particulate matter (PM) overestimation, this study aimed to: (a) Develop a refined 2021 inventory for PM10 and PM2.5 soil dust emissions in Bole City by integrating localized particle size data and the critical TSP proportion coefficient; (b) Analyze emission spatial patterns; and (c) Assess sensitivity to climate parameters. Methods were used to combine on‐site sampling, localized coefficients, the TSP coefficient, meteorological data, and remote sensing. Results showed annual emissions of 422.60 t PM10 and 166.91 t PM2.5. Grassland was the dominant source 153.03 t PM10 and 58.67 t PM2.5, while bare land contributed least 2.39 t PM10 and 1.05 t PM2.5. Emission intensities were 0.07 t/km2 PM10 and 0.03 t/km2 PM2.5. Emissions peaked sharply in April (214.70 t PM10; 66.55 t PM2.5) and were lowest in May (2.82 t PM10; 2.16 t PM2.5). Spatially, emissions were low northeast and high southwest. Precipitation was the most sensitive climate factor, followed by temperature and wind speed. In conclusion, this study provides Bole City's first localized inventory incorporating the TSP coefficient, correcting prior overestimation. It identifies grassland as the key source, highlights April's peak emissions and the distinct southwest‐increasing spatial pattern, and demonstrates precipitation's paramount sensitivity. These findings offer a crucial quantitative basis for targeted soil fugitive dust control strategies in Bole City and similar arid zones."

As compared to AQIs developed using in situ measurements of pollutants across sparse monitoring stations, satellite‐based products such as ambient PM2.5 or NO2 provide better spatiotemporal patterns. Here, we examine the long‐term (2005–2019) air pollution exposure and health impacts over India with the novel Satellite‐Based Multi‐Pollutant Index (SMPI). The high spatial resolution (1 km × 1 km) SMPI over India reveals pollution exposure hotspots in most states and districts over the Indo‐Gangetic Plain (IGP) and eastern states. The spatiotemporal patterns in SMPI exposure and its urban‐rural heterogeneity were different from either PM2.5 or NO2, highlighting the importance of multi‐pollutant indices to comprehensively assess air quality. Furthermore, we found a strong association (1.05, 95% UI: 1.025–1.075) between SMPI and odds of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), which increased with increasing co‐pollutant exposures [1.03 (1.018–1.042) to 1.184 (1.156–2.212)].

 Dust aerosols constitute a major component of shortwave-absorbing aerosols, with absorption uncertainties predominantly associated with mineral composition variations. To address this, we analyzed 22 East Asian dust (EAD) samples and derived a revised imaginary part of the complex refractive index ($$k$$), with a range spanning from $$2.26\times {10}^{-4}$$–$$8.37\times {10}^{-4}$$ in 0.3–1 μm, which is significantly lower than the Optical Properties of Aerosols and Clouds (OPAC) and the values commonly used in research on East Asian. The improved optical parameters applied to CAS-ESM2 for spring dust simulations have been shown to reduce single scattering albedo (SSA) bias from 15% to 2% and absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD) overestimation from +5.2% to −1.7%. The modified scheme reduces atmospheric absorption by 79.5% (−7.61 W/m2) and reverses the top of atmospheric shortwave radiation effect to −3.80 W/m2. This outcome revealed that dust absorption in East Asia is weak and the climate impact is significantly different from previous assessments."

This agrees with HEGIFTOM (Van Malderen et al., 2025), Stauffer et al. (2024) and Gaudel et al. (2024) TOAR-II papers. Other findings are as follows: (1) our trends are independent of method (QR, MLR) and (2) sample number (SN) (i.e., SHADOZ sampling is sufficient), and (3) all ground-based trends constitute the gold standard for satellite-derived trends. 
 Tropospheric ozone trends are important indicators of climate forcing and surface pollution, yet relevant satellite observations are too uncertain for assessments. The assessment project TOAR-II has used multi-instrument, ground-based data for global trends over 2000–2022 (Van Malderen et al., 2025a, b). For the tropics, trends are derived from SHADOZ ozonesonde profiles (Thompson et al., 2021, “T21”; Stauffer et al., 2024) or combinations of satellite, SHADOZ and IAGOS aircraft measurements (Gaudel et al., 2024). We extend T21 that covered 1998–2019, analyzing SHADOZ data at five sites with a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model for 1998–2023 and reporting trends for two free-tropospheric (FT) segments, the lowermost stratosphere and the total tropospheric column (TrCOsonde). Trends for the Aura period, 2005–2023, are computed from OMI/MLS TrCOsatellite. We find the following: 
Extending SHADOZ analyses 4 years shows little change from T21; TrCOsonde trends are small (0.5–1 DU/decade) except over SE Asia.
Annual trends for TrCOsonde and OMI/MLS TrCOsatellite agree within uncertainties at four of five sites, with the largest differences at Samoa. Sensitivity tests show the following:  
(a) Adding thousands of FT IAGOS profiles to SHADOZ yields little change in trends; SHADOZ sampling is sufficient. 
(b) Quantile Regression (QR) and MLR median trends are both near zero, but QR captures extremes (5th percentile, 95th percentile) with changes up to ±1 DU/decade (p< 0.10). 
(c) Twelve-year analyses for trends lead to uncertainty changes too large for an assessment.
This study and Van Malderen et al. (2025a, b) provide the most reliable TOAR-II trends to date: over the past ∼ 25 years, tropical FT ozone changes have been modest, ∼ (−3–+3) %/decade, except over SE Asia."

J. Stettler,An updated microphysical model for particle activation in contrails: the role of volatile plume particles,"Aerosol emissions from aircraft engines contribute to the formation of contrails, which have a climate impact comparable to that of aviation’s CO2 emissions. We show that emissions of volatile particulate matter – from fuel sulphur, unburned fuel, and lubrication oil – can increase the number of ice particles formed within a contrail and therefore have an important role in the climate impacts of aviation. This has implications for emission regulation and climate mitigation strategies. 
 Global simulations suggest the mean annual contrail cirrus net radiative forcing is comparable to that of aviation's accumulated CO2 emissions. Currently, these simulations assume non-volatile particulate matter (nvPM) and ambient particles are the only source of condensation nuclei, omitting activation of volatile particulate matter (vPM) formed in the nascent plume. Here, we extend a microphysical model to include vPM and benchmark this against a more advanced parcel model (pyrcel) modified to treat contrail formation. We explore how the apparent emission index (EI) of contrail ice crystals (AEIice) scales with EInvPM, vPM properties, ambient temperature, and aircraft/fuel characteristics. We find model agreement within 10 %–30 % in the previously defined “soot-poor” regime. However, discrepancies increase non-linearly (up to 60 %) in the “soot-rich” regime, due to differing treatment of droplet growth. Both models predict that, in the “soot-poor” regime, AEIice approaches 1016 kg−1 for low ambient temperatures (< 210 K) and sulfur-rich vPM, which is comparable to estimates in the “soot-rich” regime. Moreover, our sensitivity analyses suggest that the point of transition between the “soot-poor” and “soot-rich” regimes is a dynamic threshold that ranges from 1013–1016 kg−1 and depends sensitively on ambient temperature and vPM properties, underlining the need for vPM emission characterisation measurements. We suggest that existing contrail simulations omitting vPM activation may underestimate AEIice, especially for flights powered by lean-burn engines. Furthermore, our results imply that, under these conditions, AEIice might be reduced by (i) reducing fuel sulfur content, (ii) minimising organic emissions, and/or (iii) avoiding cooler regions of the atmosphere."

By integrating atmospheric data and transport models, the research reduces uncertainties in CO2 emissions and reveals spatial and temporal patterns. The method offers a valuable tool for supporting climate policies and can be applied to other cities for better emission verification. 
 Accurate carbon emission estimates are essential for achieving net zero targets by 2050. The Bayesian inverse method, combined with atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) measurements and a transport model, can serve as an independent verification approach to improve accuracy. We developed a Bayesian inverse modelling framework using ground- and space-based measurements and applied it to Seoul to test the framework and constrain its fossil fuel CO2 emissions. By leveraging the high temporal resolution of ground-based in situ observations and the broad spatial coverage of satellite data, we improved the accuracy of emission estimates. Our results indicate the spatiotemporal variability of posterior emissions increased significantly, enabling us to track CO2 fluctuations and assess the impact of carbon reduction policies over time and space. The mean absolute error between simulated and observed CO2 enhancements decreased by 55 %, indicating improved agreement. We investigated the performance of the inverse model through a sensitivity analysis that considered different observational network configurations. Uncertainty reductions varied with the type of observations used: 19.2 % when all observations were included, 18.7 % using only ground-based sites, and 6 %–8.4 % when using only OCO-2 or OCO-3 satellite data, highlighting the complementary contributions of ground and space-based measurements. The analysis also showed that assumptions about background concentrations, biogenic fluxes, and prior emission uncertainties can alter posterior results, demonstrating the importance of model configuration. The framework shows strong potential for application in other cities and can support the development of effective climate mitigation policies."

Ziemba,PISTON and CAMP2Ex observations of the fundamental modes of aerosol vertical variability in the Northwest Tropical Pacific and Maritime Continent's Monsoon,"We document air and ship born measurements of the vertical distribution of pollution and biomass burning aerosol particles transported within the Maritime Continent's monsoonal flows for 1000s of kilometers, and yet still exhibit intricate patterns around clouds near the ocean's surface. Findings demonstrate that, while aerosol transport occurs near the surface, there is heterogeneity in particle extinction that must be considered for both in situ observations and satellite retrievals. 
 While most large-scale smoke advection occurs within the free troposphere, Maritime Continent smoke is suspected to be unique in its long-range, near-surface transport. Such a pathway likely creates strong gradients and uncertainties in interpreting satellite and model data on light extinction, air pollution, and cloud condensation nuclei. This paper documents High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) data from the 2019 ONR PISTON cruise and NASA CAMP2Ex flights that revealed Maritime Continent smoke and pollution transport pathways and heterogeneity around the Marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer (MABL) over thousands of kilometers. Observations showed that 95 % of integrated aerosol backscatter occurred below 2500 m altitude. The R/V Sally Ride observed 50th and 84th percentile aerosol backscatter altitudes at ∼600 and ∼1500 m respectively, regardless of aerosol loading. Peak backscatter values occurred within or near the MABL top, diminishing as we approached 2–3 km altitude, but with occasional plumes reaching the melting level at 4800 m. At monsoonal scales, aerosol models largely account for the observed directional wind shear that causes altitude-dependent particle transport: near-surface particles remain in the core monsoon flow around the MABL, while at lower latitudes, aerosol layers aloft advect more eastwardly. Around the MABL, however, significant cloud-scale variability exists due to fine-scale flow, halo-entrainment-detrainment, and cold pool phenomena. Backscatter enhancements beneath individual clouds, extending to the ocean surface, likely relate to MABL-free troposphere exchange and air-sea interaction. So while aerosol transport occurs near the surface, particle extinction heterogeneity must still be considered for in situ observations and satellite retrievals."

For reduction of the climate impact, one should avoid flights forming warming contrails. This requires good weather forecast of contrail formation conditions and contrail effects. We present a two-way coupling of the Contrail Cirrus Prediction model (CoCiP) with the global Icosahedral Non-hydrostatic numerical weather model (ICON). We find that contrails are predictable – but only for a finite period. 
 Contrail forecasts typically neglect feedbacks with the atmosphere. Here, we couple the Contrail Cirrus Prediction model (CoCiP) with the global Icosahedral Non-hydrostatic (ICON) numerical weather model in a two-way mode accounting for contrail-weather interaction. The models exchange atmospheric and contrail state variables after each time step using the coupler YAC. ICON includes a new two-moment cloud ice microphysics scheme that enables skillful predictions of ice supersaturation. CoCiP now limits the uptake of ambient ice supersaturation when many contrails form. Radiation is calculated in ICON using the ECMWF radiation scheme ecRad. Contrail radiative forcing is computed from the difference of ICON results with and without contrail feedback. The coupled system results are broadly consistent with offline CoCiP simulations. The ICON results are validated against radiosonde observations and compared with ECMWF forecasts showing improved score values. The significance of the computed contrail effects is tested by numerical noise perturbation or twin experiments comparing the results of forecast pairs with initial values differing randomly. Contrails induce a butterfly effect with disturbances growing with time. Contrails induce disturbances similar to random disturbances. Within the first 5 d, contrails warm the ambient air at contrail levels. Contrails change the surface temperature and precipitation locally by an order 1 K and 10 mm d−1, with pattern similar to random disturbances and with magnitude depending on ambient weather, with negligible global mean changes. After 5 d, the weather changes are dominated by the butterfly effect. The slow response of the surface temperature to contrail RF deserves further investigations."

Lamb,Unsupervised classification of absorbing aerosols detected by the Single Particle Soot Photometer,"Aerosols that absorb sunlight play key role in Earth's climate. To improve detection of light-absorbing aerosols measured by the Single Particle Soot Photometer, we explore unsupervised machine learning. Unlike earlier methods that require labeled training data, our approach learns patterns directly from unlabeled data. This makes it more applicable to atmospheric observations. We show this method can be used to quantify how similar aerosols are to one another and improve aerosol classification. 
 The Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) detects refractory aerosol particle mass on a single-particle basis via laser-induced incandescence (L-II). While the SP2 has traditionally been used to quantify black carbon aerosol mass in the atmosphere, the instrument is increasingly being used to detect and quantify other types of absorbing aerosols, such as mineral dust or anthropogenically-sourced iron oxide aerosols. Quantifying the mass loadings and emission sources of absorbing aerosols in the atmosphere is important for understanding their role in the climate cycle. Supervised machine learning algorithms have shown potential to classify different types of aerosols from L-II signals, but these methods are sensitive to instrument configuration and require training datasets generated from laboratory samples, which do not generalize well to ambient atmospheric aerosols. Here we explore the effectiveness of unsupervised machine learning, including principal component analysis (PCA) and a variational autoencoder (VAE), applied directly to L-II signals from the SP2 in order to classify different types of absorbing aerosols. The VAE is a deep learning architecture that compresses L-II signals into a bottleneck latent representation and reconstructs an output as similar as possible to the input signal, thereby reducing dimensionality. We apply PCA and the VAE to a dataset comprised of laboratory samples of materials that show detectable incandescence in the SP2, including fullerene soot (as a proxy for black carbon), coated fullerene soot, coal fly ash, mineral dust, volcanic ash, hematite, and magnetite. We explore optimal latent representations of L-II signals to maximize separability of different aerosol classes by varying the size of the latent representation, and find that a latent representation of 3 allows us to capture the majority of the information in the L-II signals relevant for identifying different types of absorbing aerosols. We demonstrate that unsupervised machine learning is a promising method for identifying distinct populations of aerosols detected by the SP2 and for quantifying the similarity of different types of aerosols in terms of their response in the SP2."

We calibrated the data and compared it with precipitation radar and others. The sensor is stable and accurate. It can detect humidity, clouds and rain, even during storms. These results mean better forecasts, earlier storm and flood warnings, and better options for people and communities. 
 Polarimetric radio occultation (PRO) extends the capability of standard radio occultation (RO) by providing not only the conventional thermodynamic profiles but also information on clouds and precipitation. The differential phase (ΔΦ) is the cumulative phase shift between horizontal and vertical polarizations observed from PRO caused by aspherical hydrometeors along the propagation path, typically measured in millimeters. In early 2025, Yunyao Aerospace Technology Co., Ltd. successfully launched the first Chinese low Earth orbit satellite equipped with a PRO payload, generating over 500 measurements per day. Based on this mission, we established an end-to-end PRO data processing chain incorporating on-orbit calibration and tailored for operational applications. We analysed approximately 53 000 events collected between March and June 2025, in conjunction with the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) precipitation product (IMERG). The results show that ΔΦ remains close to zero under non-precipitating conditions but exhibits distinct peaks at 3–5 km altitude when traversing precipitation layers, with amplitudes strongly correlated with path-averaged rainfall rates. Thresholds of 1, 2, and 5 mm h−1 are proposed as indicators of precipitation sensitivity, detection confidence, and heavy-rain events, respectively, and a ΔΦ-to-rainfall intensity mapping table is derived to quantify this relationship. Yunyao PRO data preserve the thermodynamic retrieval quality of conventional RO while enabling effective precipitation detection, thereby providing important data support for the theoretical, technical and data research on the transition of meteorological observations from “temperature, humidity and pressure” observations to new types of observations such as precipitation."

Retrieved concentrations agree well with surface measurements. These concentrations and our estimates of the particle mass extinction efficiency are also consistent with those retrieved from airborne in situ measurements. This methodology can also be applied to the Atmosphere Lidar on the EarthCARE satellite. 
 We use measurements of near-surface aerosol backscatter, extinction, and depolarization acquired by four NASA Langley Research Center airborne High Spectral Resolution Lidars (HSRLs) in machine learning (ML) regression algorithms to derive concentrations of particulate matter (PM) with aerodynamic diameters less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5), 10 µm (PM10), and the PM2.5 / PM10 ratio. The ML regression models are trained using airborne HSRL measurements acquired over major metropolitan regions in the United States and Asia that are coincident with hourly surface PM2.5 and PM10 measurements from the EPA air quality system and similar networks in other countries. We examine several regression methods and find that exponential Gaussian Process regression (GPR) algorithms consistently give the best performance in terms of the lowest root-mean-square (RMS) errors and the highest correlations. When evaluated using surface measurements withheld from the training sets, ML models that use the HSRL near-surface measurements of aerosol backscatter and aerosol intensive properties such as depolarization, backscatter color ratio, and lidar ratio typically give the best performance with RMS differences in PM2.5 retrievals around 5 µg m−3 and correlation coefficients above 0.8, respectively. Corresponding RMS differences and correlation coefficients for PM10 retrievals are 11 µg m−3 and 0.7 and corresponding RMS differences and correlation coefficients for PM2.5 / PM10 are 0.17 and 0.75. This retrieval performance is achieved using airborne HSRL measurements alone and so does not depend on external knowledge of or assumptions regarding aerosol type, aerosol mass extinction efficiency, aerosol hygroscopic growth, the ratio of PM2.5 to PM10, particle density, or relative humidity. PM2.5 values in the training set range from about 5 to 80 µg m−3; PM10 values range from about 10 to 100 µg m−3. Accurate retrievals of PM outside these ranges would require commensurate training data. We present examples of PM retrievals in the United States as well as Asia when HSRL measurements were acquired when the aircraft flew systematic “raster-scan” patterns for several hours over major urban areas. We show that these PM2.5 retrievals are in good agreement with PM2.5 derived from coincident airborne in situ measurements near the surface as well as aloft. We describe also how the distribution of PM2.5 varies with aerosol type and altitude over these regions. We use the HSRL measurements of aerosol extinction and retrievals of surface PM2.5 along with HSRL retrievals of aerosol type to derive estimates of the fine mode aerosol mass extinction efficiency (MEEf) for major aerosol types identified by an updated HSRL aerosol classification method. MEEf ranges from about 2.6 ± 0.5 m2 g−1 for maritime aerosol to 5.0 ± 0.7 m2 g−1 for smoke. These estimates of MEEf are also in good agreement with values derived from airborne in situ measurements. We also discuss how this methodology may be applied to measurements from the Atmospheric Lidar (ATLID) on the EarthCARE satellite."

The magnitude of the dust radiative effect is dependent on their optical properties and mineralogical content. Therefore, we upgrade the METAL-WRF model to incorporate the direct radiative impact of the minerals in dust. The capabilities of the model to simulate the chemical composition and associated impacts is significantly improved. 
 Dust particles originating from desert areas of the planet have significant radiative impacts on the ground and atmospheric column, changing the energy distribution of the entire earth system, which cannot be underestimated, as dust is considered a climatic regulator. The magnitude of the dust radiative effect is dependent on the optical properties of desert dust aerosols, which in turn is regulated by the composition and mineralogical content of desert dust plumes. The mineralogical composition in atmospheric models is commonly related to the soil type at dust sources and the optical properties needed are provided by observational campaigns and dedicated measurements. In this work we upgrade the METAL-WRF model to incorporate the direct radiative impact of the minerals in dust and test the impact of the direct radiative feedback on a 2-month simulation period, namely March and April 2022, when consecutive intense dust outbursts affected the Mediterranean Basin. The simulation results were compared against Global Horizontal Irradiance data and AERONET optical properties that were measured at five sites. An improvement was observed in all sites, especially close to the sources, when the minerals and dust are treated as interacting in the radiative transfer calculations, thus improving the capabilities of METAL-WRF to simulate the chemical composition of dust particles in the atmosphere along with their contribution to radiative transfer processes."

It was compiled from seven government datasets and quality controlled. This dataset will aid research on the causes and effects of wildfire in a changing world. 
 Wildfire regimes of the western United States (US) have changed dramatically since the 1980s but our understanding of the causes and effects of these changes is limited by a lack of a quality-controlled, publicly available wildfire database that (1) spans from the 1980s to present, (2) represents wildfires across a wide range of sizes, and (3) includes mapped fire perimeters and the areas burned within. Here we present an updated and improved Western US MTBS-Interagency database (WUMI2024a) of wildfire occurrences, perimeters, and burned-area maps, covering the period 1984–2024 and the geographic domain of the 11 westernmost states in the contiguous US. The database represents 22 234 wildfires ≥ 1 km2 in size, which we compile by merging seven publicly available government databases. For over 47 % of wildfires in our database (more than 10 300 wildfires), the maps of fire perimeters and area burned are based on 30 m satellite data provided by the US government's Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) project, allowing our mapping and assessments of total area burned to account for heterogeneity within fire boundaries. For another 24 % of fires, our database includes perimeter observations provided by non-MTBS sources, meaning that only 29 % of fire occurrences are without perimeter observations. For these fires, which are generally small and account for <5 % of total burned area in the database, we tentatively assume perimeters are circular centred on the ignition location, but with shapes adjusted to not include areas dominated by open water or barren ground. The fire perimeters and burned area maps in our database are intended to improve assessments of temporal variations and trends in wildfire frequency and area burned, assessments of the landcover types that burn, and simulations of how historical fires have affected ecosystems, smoke emissions, and hydrology. The WUMI2024a can be quickly updated as new and improved data become available.

The uplifted ions accumulated at valley region altitudes ∼150 km where VRIs were generated. It is suggested that the metallic ion uplifting could be driven by storm‐time eastward penetration electric fields and/or polarization electric fields associated with equatorial plasma bubbles. It is hypothesized that the observed ion layer was formed by ion convergence produced by the joint action of electric field and meridional neutral wind and became unstable by the gradient drift instability generating the VRIs."

Here, we identify 51 ECs over the Northwest Pacific in November from 2000 to 2022 based on sea level pressure of multiple data sets. We demonstrate that a cross‐Pacific Rossby wave train, triggered by strong latent heat release due to increased precipitation of ECs, can transport substantial energy toward North America (NA). Consequently, an anomalous quasi‐barotropic ridge (trough) forms over the North Pacific (NA). Between them, northerly anomalies lead to cold advection over NA, associated with a negative air thickness anomaly, causing widespread cold anomalies there. Our findings, supported by observations and model experiments, provide novel insights into the downstream effect of ECs, including a potential source of extended‐range predictability for NA temperatures during the Fall season."

This study presents the first exploratory analysis of NO2 patterns in eastern Canada, including Ontario, Quebec, and the Atlantic provinces, using TEMPO observations. We analyzed TEMPO data (V03) gridded at 0.02° × 0.02° from September 2023 to August 2024 and compared it with the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) and surface‐level measurements from Canadian national regulatory monitors. With the hourly resolution of TEMPO, we observed diurnal trends and hotspots that were not recognized by once‐per‐day TROPOMI measurements and pinpointed undermonitored areas. NO2 in eastern Canada's eight major metropolitan areas, ports, and industrial cities similarly peaked in early morning and declined in later hours. Still, TEMPO detected variations in their hours of peaks and spikes, seasonal, and weekday‐weekend distributions. In Atlantic Canada, correlations between TEMPO and TROPOMI column densities, as well as column‐surface alignments, were lower (Spearman's ρ = 0.41–0.53) compared to the Quebec City‐Windsor Corridor (Spearman's ρ = 0.81–0.90), primarily due to a wider dynamic range of pollution in the latter region. The two regions' TEMPO‐TROPOMI mean absolute differences were 19.3% and 17.1%, respectively.

Model performance was validated against CERES, MERRA‐2, and CPCB observations, demonstrating good agreement in simulating key meteorological variables and air pollutants. Results show that ARI increases mean PM2.5 concentrations by approximately 3 μg/m3 (12.4%) across India by reducing surface shortwave radiation and enhancing atmospheric stability, which limits pollutant dispersion. In contrast, API reduces PM2.5 by about 1.8 μg/m3 (7.2%) due to lower photolysis rates, which suppress secondary aerosol formation. When combined, ARI and API lead to a net PM2.5 increase of around 2 μg/m3 (8.4%). Simultaneously, surface O3 levels decrease under all scenarios: by 2.6 ppbv (4%) with ARI, 1.7 ppbv (2.6%) with API, and 1.2 ppbv (1.8%) when both effects are included. These results underscore the complex interplay between aerosols, atmospheric stability, and chemical processes. They highlight the need for integrated air quality strategies that account for both direct emissions and feedback effects from aerosol interactions, especially in regions with diverse emission sources like India."

The DW1 amplitudes are decomposed from the neutral horizontal wind observed by four meteor radars in the equatorial region. The DW1 and zonal wind in the equatorial MLT region show consistent intraseasonal variations, implying that the upward propagating DW1 can affect the mesospheric zonal wind. By jointly analyzing the real‐time multivariate MJO (RMM) indices and mesospheric DW1, we found that DW1 responds strongly to the MJO during both boreal winter (difference relative to seasonal means: ∼20%–25%) and summer (∼25%). The MJO convection affects the mesospheric DW1 by modulating the solar radiative absorption by water vapor and latent heat release in the troposphere. The seasonal difference in DW1–MJO response can be attributed to a slight weakening of the DW1 tidal heating sources during MJO phases 1–4 and a significant enhancement during phases 6–7 during summer, driven by the moisture transport from the Indian Ocean and Pacific to the East Asian continent. This finding provides an opportunity to the understanding of the coupling between the troposphere and the mesosphere through migrating tides."

 Trends in atmospheric circulation have begun to emerge in recent decades. Summertime mean circulation trends aloft have been attributed to human influence. For low-level extreme winds, the extent of human influence and climate model fidelity remains unclear. Here, we compare satellite-era trends in extratropical low-level mean and extreme (>90th percentile) winds defined using daily distribution in reanalyses and climate model simulations. In summer, Southern Hemisphere midlatitude winds have strengthened, driven by greenhouse gas and stratospheric ozone forcings. The summertime European wind stilling trend is dominated by aerosol and greenhouse gas forcings. In winter, models cannot capture the strengthening over the Southern Hemisphere and the weakening over Europe and the subtropical North Pacific. These discrepancies, particularly in the Pacific, are reduced but persist when observed sea surface temperatures are prescribed and affect the low-level baroclinicity.

Results reveal a south‐to‐north contrast, with southern basins exhibiting high summer IVT (∼600–1,100 kg m−1 s−1) from long ARs (∼13,000 km) that sustain antecedent wetness and amplify floods, while since the 1980s ARs have shortened and weakened, and hydrologic responses have declined in central and northern basins. Basin mean ARs contributions peak in the Huai River Basin (16.5%, 70.0%, 17.9%, 3.2%) and are lowest in the Southwest Basin (0.1%, 0.8%, 0.1%, 0.04%) for precipitation, extreme precipitation, runoff, and soil moisture, respectively. ZIB indicates a declining mean AR influence on soil moisture in the east and increasing shares of extremes in the southeast; antecedent soil moisture is the strongest covariate of AR‐induced precipitation. During floods, dominant sources can reach 74.7% from the East Asia Monsoon (Yangtze River Basin, 1998), 55.6% from the West Pacific Tropics (Pearl River Basin, 2009), and 32.5% from the South Asia Monsoon (Pearl River Basin, 1985).

 Photosynthesis drives carbon into terrestrial ecosystems via gross primary production (GPP), rising ~3% decade−1 globally, paralleled by green leaf area expansion. Both trends stem from CO2 fertilization (CFE), climate change, and landcover change, yet spatial mismatches exist between GPP and leaf area changes. Canopy scale GPP changes are separated into those resulting from leaf area changes and those from changing photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area. The latter, by normalizing for leaf area, isolate production dependency on CO2, light and water availability, and the kinetics of the process itself. Arid/semi-arid shrublands and grasslands show substantial CO2 assimilation gains, dominated by CFE and beneficial climate effects. Conversely, croplands and forests exhibit declining leaf assimilation rate due to increased shading from excessive greening and adverse climate shifts (e.g., reduced precipitation, higher VPD). The Sudano-Sahelian zone exemplifies assimilation increases in sparse vegetation, while conspicuously greening regions like China and India face assimilation declines. This pattern of canopy GPP increases from gains in both leaf scale assimilation rates and leaf area in sparse vegetation of inhospitable climes, and only from leaf area gains in more productive vegetation of favorable environments, whilst counter-intuitive, suggests an unforeseen potential for carbon sequestration in sparsely vegetated lands. Vegetation in arid regions benefits from higher leaf-scale assimilation rates and expanded leaf area, boosting carbon uptake, while productive forests and croplands experience declines due to increased shading and climate stress, based on remote sensing data and multiple process-based models."

 Large-scale ecological restoration has enhanced ecosystem services, but its impacts on terrestrial water storage (TWS) remain debated. Our study challenges the prevailing assumption that restoration activities inevitably reduce TWS. Here we construct a long-term TWS record (1987-2020) to analyze hydrological dynamics in the Mu Us Sandyland in China, a region undergoing intensified ecological restoration since 1999. Our findings delineate three distinct hydrological phases: stable pre-restoration conditions (1987-1998), rapid TWS depletion (2003-2010), and subsequent unintended recovery (2011-2020). Satellite and modeling data reveal that ecological restoration and agricultural expansion initially reduce TWS through enhanced plant transpiration, while vegetation-mediated atmospheric feedback later appears to boost regional precipitation. Climate projections suggest this region may experience 51%-351% TWS growth by 2100 even under the climate-resilient SSP1-2.6 scenario, potentially supporting regional water sustainability. These findings revise our understanding of ecological-water interactions, showing that well-designed ecological restoration may overcome initial water deficits through climate system adaptation.

This sunlight-absorbing, self-lofting aerosol perturbs the radiation budget and stratospheric dynamics differently from major volcanic eruptions, which are also included in this study. 
 Recent studies suggest that  emissions from large forest fires affect stratospheric chemistry, dynamics, and climate, similar to major volcanic eruptions. Using the chemistry-climate model EMAC, we demonstrate that organic carbon emitted from forest fires, injected into the stratosphere through pyro-cumulonimbi, enhances heterogeneous chlorine activation related to high solubility of HCl in particles containing organic acids and an augmented aerosol surface area, in agreement with existing literature. Following the 2019/2020 Australian megafires, the upward transport of the pollution plumes resulted in enhanced ozone depletion in the Southern Hemisphere lower stratosphere, as corroborated by satellite observations. It diminished column ozone in the following two years, accompanied by a dynamically induced reduction in 2020 due to the lofting of smoke-filled vortices, in total by up to 45 DU. The eruption of the submarine Hunga Tonga volcano in January 2022 caused a decline in total ozone across the entire Southern Hemisphere. The water vapour injection from the volcano altered only the vertical distribution of ozone loss. The sunlight-absorbing aerosol from the Australian and, to a smaller extent, the Canadian forest fire emissions in 2019/2020 induced the most significant perturbation in stratospheric optical depth since the major eruption of Pinatubo in 1991. It shifted the sign of instantaneous stratospheric aerosol forcing, derived at the top of the atmosphere, from −0.2 to +0.3 W m−2  in January 2020. The global aerosol radiative forcing resulting from the Hunga Tonga eruption was −0.16 W m−2, primarily driven by changes in stratospheric sulfate aerosols. The positive radiative forcing from the injected water vapour was minimal."

By computing single-scattering properties online at the crystal scale, it eliminates the need for precomputed lookup tables, improving efficiency and angular resolution for satellite, airborne, and ground-based observation retrievals. 
 We present CrystalTrace, a Monte Carlo raytracing algorithm designed for radiative transfer computations involving ice crystals with both random and preferred orientations. Integrated into the three-dimensional radiative transfer solver MYSTIC, which is part of libRadtran, CrystalTrace enables multiple-scattering simulations of absolute radiances for realistic atmospheric scenes, including clouds with different mixtures of ice crystals and water droplets, aerosols, molecules, and surface properties. It seamlessly extends MYSTIC's macroscopic raytracing down to the microscopic scale of individual ice crystals. By computing single-scattering properties online, CrystalTrace removes the need for precomputed look-up tables, which are also subject to limited angular resolution. The current version of CrystalTrace is implemented for the visible spectral range and supports individual hexagonal prisms with different sizes and aspect ratios. It currently does not account for diffraction and ice absorption. CrystalTrace, integrated with MYSTIC, fills a critical gap by providing a computationally efficient forward radiative transfer simulator for ice clouds containing oriented crystals, thereby enabling retrievals of ice crystal properties from ground-based, airborne, and satellite imaging observations.

Baran,Estimating vertical profiles of ice water content and snowfall rate from radar measurements in the G-band,"This work presents the first known retrievals of ice cloud and snowfall properties using G-band radar, representing a major step forward in the use of high-frequency radar for atmospheric remote sensing. We present theory and simulations to show that ice water content (IWC) and snowfall rate (S) can be retrieved efficiently with a single frequency G-band radar if the mass of a wavelength-sized particle is known or can be assumed, while details of the particle size distribution are not required. 
 We present theory and simulations to show that at frequencies of order 200 GHz (G-band) the radar cross section (σr) of ice particles larger than ∼ a quarter wavelength (0.375 mm) is nearly directly proportional to their mass (m). Hence measurements of radar reflectivity (Z) at this frequency are directly proportional to the ice water content (IWC), with no other assumptions about the shape or breadth of the particle size distribution required. For the same reason, vertically pointing Doppler velocities at this frequency provide the mass-weighted mean vertical velocity of the particles, and the product of Z with the mean Doppler velocity (MDV) is proportional to the snowfall rate (S). This presents the opportunity for straightforward and accurate retrievals of ice microphysics.We explore the sensitivity of such retrievals to the scattering model for ice particles. We find that all seven models examined, four with random orientation and three with horizontal orientation, have σr∝m in this regime, but that the coefficient of proportionality varies between models. The dominant factor controlling this coefficient is the mass-size relationship for the ice particles, and specifically the mass of a wavelength-sized ice particle. If this information is known, or can be assumed, then the ice population parameters above can be retrieved with high accuracy. For mass-weighted mean diameters Dm>0.5 mm the variation in the IWC–Z relationship is within ≈ 30 %, and the variation in the S–(Z×MDV) relationship is within ≈ 15 %.The method is applied to retrieve IWC and S during two case studies, with measurements from the GRaCE 200 GHz Doppler radar at Chilbolton Observatory in the UK. In the first of these case studies, retrieved snowfall rates from particles falling aloft in a precipitating ice cloud were compared to gauge data at the surface. In the second case study, retrieved ice water contents from a deep non-precipitating stratiform ice cloud were compared to measurements made using an evaporative water content probe on board the Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM) BAe-146 instrumented research aircraft. In both cases a statistical comparison was necessary because of imperfect colocation of the radar measurements and in-situ/gauge sampling. The measurements fall within the distributions of the retrieved water content and snowfall fields, and follow consistent trends with time (Case 1) and height (Case 2), providing evidence that this method produces realistic retrievals.Application of the same technique at even higher radar frequencies would allow clouds with smaller particles (e.g. in high altitude cirrus clouds) to be characterised. Because of the increased gaseous attenuation at such frequencies, the latter may be more practical from airborne or spaceborne platforms."

However, the ability of geostationary imagery to resolve contrails has not been systematically characterized. By comparing higher spatial resolution low Earth orbit satellite imagery from Visual Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) to geostationary satellite imagery from GOES ABI, we show that the latter does not resolve 80% of the contrails nor half of the total length compared to contrails identified with VIIRS.

This study introduces a satellite‐constrained inversion framework that jointly optimizes fire emissions and net ecosystem exchange using OCO‐2 XCO2 retrievals. An observing system simulation experiment demonstrates the approach's capability to improve emission estimates, especially in regions where fires occur during the non‐growing season. Applied to Africa, the inversion yields fire emissions of 1.18 ± 0.22 PgC yr−1 for 2015–2016––about 20% higher than GFED4s and GFAS averages. Regionally, emissions were underestimated in northern Africa (∼0.25 PgC yr−1) due to missing burned area and overestimated in southern Africa (∼0.05 PgC yr−1) due to inflated fuel assumptions. The inversion reduces inter‐inventory discrepancies by 88% and reveals pronounced landscape‐dependent biases. These findings highlight the potential of XCO2‐based joint inversions to enhance regional emission estimates and improve representations of fire–carbon–climate feedbacks in Earth system models."

Thermosphere‐Ionosphere‐Electrodynamics General Circulation Model simulations indicate that trans‐equatorial wind played a key role in these variations. Wavelet periodograms of ground‐based Total Electron Content measurements confirmed the presence of Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances (TIDs). Storm‐induced winds and TIDs likely changed the altitude of the F‐peaks and the recombination rates between crests, and plasma transport by trans‐equatorial winds also contributed to this rare phenomenon."

Ng,OH-Initiated Photooxidation of Gas-Phase Atmospherically Relevant Monoterpene-Derived Organic Nitrates,"Monoterpene-derived organic nitrates (MT-ONs) can influence NOx recycling, secondary organic aerosol, and ozone formation. While OH-initiated photooxidation is considered a sink for MT-ONs, the rate constants and mechanisms remain poorly constrained. We investigate the gas phase photooxidation of three synthetic ONs derived from α-pinene, β-pinene, and d-limonene (3°_ApHN, 1°_BpHN, and 2°_LmHN) through chamber experiments. The photooxidation rate constants for MT-ONs range from (5.7 ± 0.5) to (11.0 ± 1.5) × 10–11 cm3 molecule–1 s–1, with corresponding lifetimes of 1.7–3.2 h under ambient OH concentrations. If we consider that products without a nitrooxy group (CHO) represent MT-ONs undergoing photooxidation to form NOx or nitric acid, our measurements suggest that up to 85%, 49%, and 23% of 3°_ApHN, 2°_LmHN, and 1°_BpHN, respectively, contribute to NOx recycling. The prevalence of CHO products is influenced by the molecular structure of MT-ONs and different peroxy radical chemistry. These results are different from prior studies that suggest that photooxidation leads to the complete degradation of MT-ONs into NOx or nitric acid. We propose photooxidation mechanisms, highlighting both OH addition and H abstraction as important processes. This study provides fundamental data to evaluate the contributions of MT-ON photooxidation to NOx recycling and offers new insights into the broader implications of ON chemistry in the atmosphere."

While water-lean and biphasic solvents have been developed to lower energy consumption and control capture costs, however, their high organic content introduces new challenges, such as amine loss and solvent component imbalance. Herein, an innovative and feasible integrated solution─water scrubbing coupled with reverse osmosis (WS-RO)─was proposed, based on the synergistic regulation of multiphase mass transfer and separation in the complex CO2 capture process. The pilot-scale experiments confirmed the inverse effect of solvent concentration on the reduction of energy consumption and the inhibition of amine escape: while energy consumption could be reduced to 2.47 GJ/t CO2, the total amine emissions were up to 216 mg/m3. The multistage water washing was well validated in controlling amine escape, including aerosols and gaseous amines. Coupling with efficient washing liquid separation by reverse osmosis, amine escape could be reduced to below 1.5 mg/m3, with approximately 99% of the amine components returning to the system, ensuring material balance. This study offers a viable strategy to simultaneously address energy consumption and amine loss in novel concentrated solvents, facilitating their industrial deployment."

Three solutions were retested 3 to 12 months after the initial assessment using the same protocol and facility to evaluate how performance changed over time. Results indicated that hand-held OGI cameras generally achieved better emission source localization accuracy as well as lower 90% probability of detection and false positive fraction compared to other solution categories. The false negative fractions of OGI cameras were comparable to those of hand-held NextGen solutions but generally lower than those of mobile solutions, which exhibited shorter survey durations relative to other categories of hand-held solutions. The performance of two of  three solutions improved with repeat testing, highlighting the potential benefit of regular, comprehensive testing for the development of solutions.

We introduce a two-tiered mobile measurement approach, using a mobile laboratory to measure methane concentrations across 125 well pads (approximately 750 wells) distributed among four major production blocks (Changning, Weiyuan, Fuling, and Luzhou). These blocks contributed 84% of China’s total shale gas production in 2023, providing the first comprehensive ground-level measurements. Stationary downwind monitoring of well pads revealed emission rates from 0.002 to 98.86 kg/h, validated through mobile observations of methane concentrations across the region. Notably, emissions were highly concentrated, with 89% originating from just 10% of the well pads. For 2023, the extrapolated methane emissions from China’s shale gas production were estimated  at 16,842 t (6,444–29,991 t, 95% CI), corresponding to a  methane leakage rate of 0.10% (0.04%–0.17%, 95% CI). This rate is lower than major U.S. fields and similar to that of U.S. dry gas fields. Our research identifies gas lift venting, incomplete combustion from compressors, and process venting as significant sources of super-emissions in China’s shale gas upstream production chain. The methodology employed, based on comprehensive and targeted field measurements, demonstrates its effectiveness in providing a scientific basis for formulating precise and effective regulatory policies on methane emissions."

This study investigated the temporal variations and spatial patterns of legacy and emerging PFAS in soil of Shanghai, China, by analyzing 162 soil samples collected in 2007, 2012, and 2017. The results revealed that sum PFAS concentrations ranged from 110 to 18000 pg/g, with an upward trend over the decade (median levels: 1090, 1190, and 2390 pg/g in 2007, 2012, and 2017, respectively). Long-chain PFAS dominated the contaminant profile with perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) (1370–2090 pg/g) consistently exceeding perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs) (145–466 pg/g). For soil samples collected in 2017, a significant amount of F-53B was noted (median: 148 pg/g) as compared to PFOS (median: 95.7 pg/g) and PFOA (median: 1250 pg/g), highlighting the importance of measuring this compound in the Chinese environment. Spatially, PFAS contamination expanded over time, with the pollution center shifting from urban Shanghai to the southwest, forming a new hotspot in that sector. However, no significant correlation was observed between the PFAS distribution and land use. A mass balance analysis indicated that unidentified organofluorine constituted a substantial proportion of extractable organofluorine (90.1, 92.7, and 88.2% in 2007 (target PFAS 11), 2012 (target PFAS 11), and 2017 (target PFAS 20), respectively), highlighting significant gaps in current contaminant identification. These findings provide critical insights into the long-term dynamics of PFAS in a soil environment and underscore the need for future research to prioritize the characterization of unknown fluorine compounds in environmental monitoring."

Observations in nonarid areas suggested significant influences from aqueous-phase oxidation on FAA compositions and abundances. However, the origins and processing of aerosol PrM in arid and dusty areas remain poorly understood. The characterizations of CAAs and FAAs in PM2.5 and dust from leaf surfaces, roads, and buildings were investigated throughout the cold seasons in arid Lanzhou (northwest China). Leucine dominated CAAs in both PM2.5 and dust samples. This finding, combined with evidence from amino acid nitrogen isotope signal and Mantel test analysis, strongly suggests that soil (/dust) is the main contributor (up to 38%) to total aerosol amino acids in Lanzhou, followed by vegetation and biomass burning. Glycine dominated aerosol FAAs during winter (relative humidity = 50 ± 14%) and correlated significantly with atmospheric oxidation levels, while these patterns were absent during the drier spring with higher atmospheric oxidation capacity. We propose that low relative humidity (33 ± 15%), rather than weak aerosol acidity (pH = 8.1 ± 1.0), constrains PrM degradation during spring, leading to a significant reduction in free glycine mass fraction. This study presents the first observational evidence for constrained PrM degradation under dry conditions."

McIntyre,Climate-Associated Oxythermal Squeezes Elevate Mercury in a Lacustrine Food Fish,"Climate change is heating surface waters while deoxygenating bottom waters of lakes, compressing vertical habitat for cold-water fish. Resulting increases in the volume of water lacking dissolved oxygen (anoxia) could facilitate the formation of toxic, bioaccumulating methylmercury (MeHg). Oxythermal squeezes, where thermally stressful surface water pushes cold-water fish species against or into low-oxygen deep water, could enhance mercury bioaccumulation. Here, we test this hypothesis using high-resolution oxygen data and brook trout muscle mercury data for 16 neighboring lakes (Adirondack Park, New York, USA) collected in the fall of two consecutive years. In four anoxic lakes that underwent oxythermal squeezes in both years, muscle mercury concentrations were consistently elevated (0.40 μg/g mean (0.08 μg/g SD) length-adjusted wet weight concentration), and averaged more than double the levels in well-oxygenated lakes. Importantly, lakes with substantial anoxic zones yet no oxythermal habitat compression showed intermediate concentrations, indicating that forcing fish to reside next to oxygen-depleted water plays a key role in boosting their methylmercury exposure. Climate change is pushing many lakes toward such oxythermal habitat squeezes; hence, our findings suggest that higher fish mercury contamination is to be expected, even when external loading of mercury to aquatic ecosystems is stable or declining."

In this study, amides and alcohols were identified as the most permeable substances, exhibiting permeation rates 30 to 90 times higher than those of inorganic ions and carboxylic acids. Systematic molecular parameter analysis revealed that molecular polarity, alongside van der Waals volume, determines transport behavior. By incorporating the molecular polarity index into the solution-friction model, it successfully explained transport differences between compounds of similar size but different functional groups. Theoretical calculations revealed the transport mechanism for charge-neutral organics: highly polar organic molecules preferentially partition at the membrane interface through hydrogen bonding, and are subsequently transported across the membrane channels via water clusters. A predictive model was developed, achieving >85% accuracy for diverse charge-neutral organics under environmentally relevant concentrations (μg·L–1). These findings advance the mechanistic understanding beyond size exclusion effects for RO and guide membrane design optimization for enhanced organic rejection."

This study finds divergent behaviour in migration rates for rivers in discontinuous versus continuous permafrost, driven by changes in permafrost thaw and river ice. 
 Arctic rivers mobilize vast stocks of permafrost carbon as they migrate across floodplains. However, there is no consensus about whether Arctic rivers are responding to regional warming by speeding up or slowing down. Here we reconstruct migration rates over the period 1972–2020 for Arctic and sub-Arctic rivers spanning approximately 1,500 km of distance and a variety of channel sizes and floodplain environments. We find that rivers in warmer, discontinuous permafrost settings experienced a systematic acceleration over the past 50 years, whereas rivers in colder, continuous permafrost regions experienced a systematic slowdown. We identify two competing mechanisms responsible for this bifurcating behaviour: thaw of permafrost floodplains has driven faster migration, whereas a decline in the intensity of river-ice breakup has slowed migration. Using a mechanistic model, we find that the relative balance of these two controls is well described by air temperature, revealing a simple organizing framework for how Arctic rivers respond to warming. Whether rivers are speeding up or slowing down in a warming Arctic is unclear, but has implications for carbon cycling and infrastructure.

 The global transition to low-carbon energy depends on energy transition minerals (ETMs). Yet, the extraction of these minerals often occurs in biodiverse and carbon-rich forests, potentially undermining their climate benefits. Here we provide global, causally identified estimates of deforestation and related GHG emissions attributable to ETM mining, combining nearly 3,000 projects with satellite-based forest-change data. Using a staggered difference-in-differences design, we find that ETM mining causes sustained forest loss—averaging ~20% within 10-km buffers over 15 years—comparable in magnitude to traditional minerals such as coal and gold. These losses are disproportionately concentrated in tropical forests with high climate mitigation potential. Incorporating deforestation-related emissions increases the mining-stage carbon footprint of ETMs by 63% on average and up to 98% for certain minerals. Our findings reveal mining-induced land-use change as a major but overlooked source of emissions in global energy transition.

 The bimodal distribution of tropical cyclone (TC) lifetime maximum intensity (LMI) has strengthened in recent decades, yet the mechanisms underlying this distribution and its recent changes remain debated. Here, we introduce a rate-duration framework that decomposes LMI into two fundamental components: mean intensification rate and intensification duration. Using global observations, we show that intensification duration is closely tied to genesis locations, and has decreased by 1.4 h per decade (3.4%) during 1982–2023, primarily due to poleward and landward shifts in genesis. This shortening suppresses TC intensification, offsetting nearly half (48.7%) of the rate-induced increase in strong TCs. High-resolution climate models corroborate these findings, revealing that future warming further shortens intensification duration, partially counteracting the increase of LMI. Our results highlight the importance of timescale constraint on TC intensity, providing a quantitative attribution of the competing roles of rate versus duration in shaping LMI and its response to warming."

 Understanding the high mercury concentrations observed in Arctic ecosystems requires in-depth knowledge of mercury cycling. Here, we show that variations in mercury concentration in the sediments of the North American Arctic Margin and the Arctic Ocean basins can be explained by carbon sources and cycling. Sedimentary mercury concentrations are predicted (p < 0.001) considering three carbon sources and, in some areas, the recapture of soluble mercury released during burial. Terrigenous organic carbon dominates mercury delivery (50-90%) in the western North American Arctic Margin, whereas inorganic carbon predominates at many eastern sites (40-70%). Marine organic carbon contributes <15% of the total mercury concentration. Mercury–organic carbon endmember ratios of terrigenous and marine organic carbon are higher in deep Arctic Ocean basins than in the continental margin, likely due to greater organic matter remineralization during transit. The observed enrichment in mercury toward the sediment surface results from remineralization of organic carbon, not from an increase in mercury flux.

 Meeting the growing demand for maize while reducing nitrogen losses remains a key challenge for sustainable agriculture. Here, we present a market-based nitrogen insurance concept that allows farmers who apply excess fertilizer to reduce nitrogen use without financial risk. Using a large-scale process-based crop model dataset covering 4270 maize fields in Illinois, over 30 years of weather data, and 33 fertilizer rates, we found that the insurance is profitable for farmers applying at least 40 kilograms of nitrogen per hectare above recommended rates, yielding average annual gains of 14 dollars per hectare for farmers and 10 dollars per hectare for insurers. Applied across the eligible Illinois maize area, the insurance annually reduces nitrate leaching by 31% and lowers greenhouse gas emissions by 682,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. This self-sustaining approach could be extended to other nitrogen-intensive crops and regions, providing a globally relevant pathway to reconcile farm profitability with environmental stewardship.

 The Thermal Infrared Spectrometer (TIS) onboard Sustainable Development Science Satellite-1 (SDGSAT-1) features three unique channels with a broader spectral range compared to previous thermal infrared multi-channel sensors. The split-window (SW) and temperature-and-emissivity separation (TES) algorithms are suitable for land surface temperature (LST) retrieval from TIS data. However, both SW and TES require auxiliary information, and the temporal and spatial inconsistency of auxiliary information can lead to errors in LST retrieval. We propose a wide-band atmospheric correction TES algorithm, which can retrieve LST without any auxiliary atmospheric and land surface parameter input. By leveraging the stability of wide-band imaging, atmospheric transmittance and upward radiation are modeled, thereby reducing the number of unknowns in the radiative transfer equation. Additionally, a transmittance ratio refinement module is incorporated, which iteratively refines the transmittance. Experiments conducted on simulated datasets demonstrate that this method achieves an RMSE of 1.32 K, remaining stable at 1.39 K with estimated transmittance, indicating strong robustness to variations in water vapor content. Cross-validation results for the Wuhan region show a bias of −1.79 K and an RMSE of 2.28 K when compared to MODIS temperature products, suggesting that the retrieved LST captures more detailed information. Furthermore, a comparison with the general split-window (GSW) algorithm and MODTRAN-TES was conducted, selecting 108 validation points at Heihe, SURFRAD, ICOS, TERN, and BSRN stations for ground validation, yielding root mean square errors (RMSE) of 2.07 K, 1.55 K, 1.84 K, 1.72 K, and 2.14 K respectively, with an RMSE of 1.95 K across all validation sites.

 Forests are a critical component of the Earth system, accounting for approximately one-third of global photosynthetic activity and carbon storage. They also provide essential habitats for countless species and vital resources for human activities. Low-frequency (L-band; 1–2 GHz) microwave radiometry enables the measurement of forest soil moisture (SM) and L-band vegetation optical depth (L-VOD), offering valuable insights into processes such as tree growth, water infiltration, soil fertility, fuel moisture, carbon stocks, wildfire vulnerability, and biodiversity dynamics. These measurements also support the study of carbon and water fluxes, tree responses to hydrological stress (e.g., drought), and fuel moisture estimation. However, existing algorithms for retrieving SM and L-VOD were primarily developed for low-biomass vegetation types (e.g., grasslands and croplands), differing structurally from forests. This motivates the present review to evaluate the current retrieval approaches, their performance assessment methods, and available validation resources. The review found that systematic uncertainties persist in forest retrievals, despite the demonstrated sensitivity of L-band brightness temperature (TB) to forest SM and L-VOD. Moreover, the focus on non-forest ecosystems has led to a lack of suitable ground truth and reference data for validating forest SM and L-VOD products, and current validation techniques remain underdeveloped. To fully harness the potential of L-band radiometry in forest monitoring, new retrieval algorithms that account for the unique structural and compositional characteristics of forests are required. Additionally, validation efforts must be enhanced both quantitatively and qualitatively—particularly for L-VOD—to improve confidence in these remote sensing products."

 Surface reflectance, a fundamental parameter for deriving high-level satellite products, is typically obtained through atmospheric correction. However, in rugged terrains, topographic effects substantially distort surface reflectance estimates. Many post-topographic correction methods for surface reflectance were proposed and applied to mitigate topographic effects. However, the coupled atmospheric and topographic influences in radiative transfer processes cause significant errors when these corrections are performed separately. For example, we observed over 50 % of pixels in the official Landsat 8 surface reflectance data across a complex terrain exhibited physically implausible negative values, predominantly in shadowed areas. Moreover, traditional pixel-by-pixel methods failed to leverage valuable spatial information for estimation. To address these limitations, we developed an integrated atmospheric and topographic correction framework, Unet-TopoFlat, leveraging a spatial-spectral Attention U-Net algorithm and a novel pseudo-topographic synthetic strategy. The pseudo-topographic synthetic strategy generated sufficient and robust topographically incorporated TOA radiance samples across different terrains, surfaces, and atmospheric conditions, using surface reflectance over flat terrains based on radiative transfer models, atmospheric parameters, random forest regression, and a mountainous radiative transfer parameterization scheme. Using Landsat 8 data as a proxy for evaluation, the Unet-TopoFlat was trained on 47,398 samples (256 × 256 pixels), leveraging multiple datasets. The Unet-TopoFlat model effectively captured the spatial and spectral relationships between TOA radiance and surface reflectance, achieving a relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of 4.5 %–6.2 % across 20,314 samples spanning different terrain, temporal, and spectral bands. Compared to the baseline Unet-FLAT model, which lacked topographic consideration and exhibited substantial uncertainties, Unet-TopoFlat effectively reduced topographic effects, lowering negative reflectance ratios from 55.5 % to 2.8 % while accurately recovering surface information and preserving spectral information. Moreover, the leaf area index (LAI) and snow cover mapping using our estimated surface reflectance were superior to those using official products, and deviations reached up to 2.4 for LAI and 8 % for snow cover mapping at the regional scale. Our proposed framework is not sensor-specific and can be potentially applied to multiple optical remotely sensed data."

 Ocean lidar technology, an emerging active remote sensing method, excels at revealing the vertical structure of subsurface ocean layers, addressing challenges in carbon flux, phytoplankton analysis, and biogeochemical monitoring. Current lidar inversion methods, however, rely on empirical formulations for homogeneous waters and overlook photon multiple scattering, which introduces significant uncertainties, especially in complex coastal ecosystems. To overcome this, we present an iterative hybrid multiple scattering-corrected retrieval method based on 117,456 vertical profiles (2017–2024) in the South China Sea. The model combines the optimization of backscatter–attenuation ratios, lidar ratios, and semianalytical simulations of multiple scattering effects integrated with XGBoost machine learning to relate lidar-derived optical properties (Kd, bbp) to biogeochemical parameters (Chl, POC). Compared with the satellite ocean color products, the retrieval results derived from airborne and shipborne lidar observations show strong agreement: Kd (R = 0.76, RMSD = 0.01 m−1, MAPD = 6.58 %), bbp (R = 0.80, RMSD = 0.00 m−1, MAPD = 28.93 %), Chl (R = 0.61, RMSD = 0.29 μg/L, MAPD = 32.82 %), and POC (R = 0.88, RMSD = 20.55 μg/L, MAPD = 18.14 %). These results bridge active and passive remote sensing. This study also reveals the dynamic three-dimensional characteristics of the subsurface phytoplankton layer in the South China Sea, revealing spatial and temporal heterogeneity influenced by environment factors. The nearshore subsurface phytoplankton layer shows diurnal variations in thickness and intensity driven by tidal processes: it thickens and ascends during the day and thins and descends at night. Larger tidal amplitudes are linked to shallower layers and higher chlorophyll-a concentrations. These findings demonstrate the potential of lidar technology for large-scale, long-term monitoring of subsurface ocean profiles, offering an important complement to in situ and passive satellite remote sensing data."

 The occurrence of landslides can potentially cause considerable economic impact on a global scale, resulting in damage to exposed structures and infrastructures, including buildings. In order to determine the most efficacious risk mitigation strategies, the scientific community is engaged in the analyses aimed at assessing the expected consequences of landslide activation/reactivation. This approach involves the implementation of quantitative risk assessment procedures, based on the definition of the landslide susceptibility and intensity, the identification of exposed elements, and the vulnerability assessment, which represents the most challenging parameter. The present work proposes an approach to the quantitative vulnerability assessment for buildings exposed to slow-kinematic landslides via empirical fragility and vulnerability curves, which express the probabilistic relationship between the damage severity to exposed buildings and the intensity of the landslide. A comprehensive database was compiled, collating information on landslide-induced damage to over four thousand buildings in the Northern Apennines of Central Italy. The landslide intensity is evaluated by exploiting the worldwide freely accessible Sentinel-1 SAR images, which have been processed by using the Parallel-Small BAseline (P-SBAS) – Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR) processing chain. The Institute for Electromagnetic Sensing of the Environment (IREA) of the National Research Council (CNR) of Italy is responsible for the processing of the Sentinel-1 SAR images, within the framework of an agreement with the Italian Ministry of Environment and Energy Security (MASE) for the detection and analysis of ground displacement over the entire Italian territory. The ultimate objective of the present study is the exploitation of the derived vulnerability curve into the quantitative risk assessment procedure for a comprehensive evaluation of buildings in the Northern Apennines."

 As a key biophysical parameter describing forest vegetation structure, Leaf Area Index (LAI) is an essential and widely used indicator for evaluating forest ecosystem function and health. LAI retrieval from remote sensing observations primarily relies on canopy radiative transfer models (RTMs) that quantitatively characterize the complex relationship between canopy parameters and reflectance. However, most physical models currently used for LAI retrieval are one-dimensional (1D) RTMs, which typically assume the canopy to be horizontally homogeneous and thus fail to capture the inherent heterogeneity within the canopy. Although three-dimensional (3D) RTMs can better characterize the structural complexity of forest canopies, their high computational demand and the difficulty of parameterization often limit their application to large-scale remote sensing retrievals. In this study, a novel 3D Look-Up Table (3D-LUT) approach was developed for retrieving forest LAI from Landsat by accounting for the heterogeneity within forests through the integration of LiDAR-based scene reconstructions to parameterize the RTM. Instead of using idealized homogeneous layers or simple geometric objects, our approach used airborne LiDAR data to reconstruct realistic and structurally representative 3D forest scenes for typical forest types, including Deciduous Broadleaf Forest (DBF), Deciduous Needleleaf Forest (DNF), Evergreen Broadleaf Forest (EBF), and Evergreen Needleleaf Forest (ENF). Based on these reconstructed forest scenes, type-specific LAI look-up tables (LUTs) were built by coupling the 3D RTM Large-scalE remote Sensing data and image Simulation (LESS) with an analytical model PATH_RT, an accurate and efficient RTM based on 3D path-length distribution and spectral invariant theory, enabling accurate LAI retrieval from Landsat imagery. This method was compared against field observations collected from 16 National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) sites and 8 Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) sites, which comprise a representative sample of different forest types. Additionally, intercomparison was conducted using the High-resolution Global LAnd Surface Satellite (Hi-GLASS) LAI product, Simplified Level-2 Prototype Processor (SL2P) algorithm and the MODIS LAI product. Validation against in situ data demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can achieve high-accuracy retrieval of LAI across four forest types, with RMSE ranging from 0.93 to 1.20 m2/m2 and MAE from 0.73 to 1.00 m2/m2. The intercomparison results revealed that retrieval algorithms based on the PROSAIL model, such as SL2P, tend to underestimate forest LAI. In contrast, the proposed algorithm shows strong overall agreement with the Hi-GLASS LAI product and MODIS LAI product, which are derived from a deep learning framework and a 3D RTM, respectively, supporting its reliability for regional-scale forest LAI retrieval. By generating the simulated dataset derived from realistically reconstructed 3D forest structures using LiDAR data, this study further advances the application of LiDAR in quantitative remote sensing retrieval."

 Chlorophyll is a fundamental component of photosynthesis and a key indicator in quantitative vegetation remote sensing. However, accurate retrieval of leaf chlorophyll content from top-of-canopy (TOC) reflectance is often hindered by soil background and canopy structural effects. To address these challenges, we developed the Interference-Mitigation Chlorophyll Index (IMCI), derived from the spectral properties of leaves and soils together with canopy radiative transfer processes, to enhance robustness under complex soil and canopy conditions.The development of IMCI consists of three steps. First, the soil single-scattering component (ρs1) is removed from TOC reflectance using two spectral features: (a) vegetation reflectance remains equivalent at 598 and 694 nm regardless of leaf color, while soil reflectance differs; and (b) soil reflectance exhibits an approximately linear dependence on wavelength within 590–750 nm. These features enable accurate estimation and correction of ρs1, yielding soil-adjusted TOC spectra (ρc∼). Second, a proxy for the vegetation single-scattering component (ρl1) is constructed from soil-adjusted red-edge difference–ratio reflectance values (∆ρc∼λj/∆ρc∼λi). Exploiting the linearity of the red-edge, we demonstrated that the extrapolated intersection of ∆ρc∼ and ρl1 in the red-edge region converges to a reflectance value approaching 0 and further derived that ∆ρc∼λj/∆ρc∼λi can serve as a direct approximation of ∆ρl1λj/∆ρl1λi, which was adopted as the basic form of IMCI. Furthermore, under the chlorophyll-induced red-edge shift, we established a quantitative relationship between IMCI and red-edge displacement, confirming its sensitivity to chlorophyll content. Theoretical derivations and assumptions underlying these steps were extensively validated empirically.The proposed IMCI was evaluated using multi-species and multi-scale field datasets as well as synthetic datasets. Results demonstrated strong agreement between estimated and measured Cab, with R2 consistently ranging from 0.87 to 0.97 and RMSE from 2.87 to 6.47 μg·cm-2. Tests on hyperspectral imagery with different spatial resolutions further confirmed the robustness of IMCI in heterogeneous canopies. Overall, IMCI improves the accuracy and reliability of chlorophyll estimation from TOC reflectance and provides new insights for quantitative vegetation physiology remote sensing and practical monitoring applications."

 Ice clouds, composed of irregular ice crystals, play a critical role in the Earth's radiative balance and climate regulation. Satellite polarimetric observations, such as those from the POLarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectance-3 (POLDER-3), exhibit high sensitivity to particle characteristics, making them valuable for deriving ice cloud microphysical properties. Conventional ice cloud remote sensing methods typically rely on single-particle models, which assume a prior particle shape across entire regions, thereby neglecting the inherent spatial heterogeneity. Under this context, the super-ellipsoidal particle model was developed, enabling continuous variation in surface morphology through three parameters (i.e., aspect ratio, roundness, and surface roughness), thus facilitating the retrieval of particle shape variations. To comprehensively consider the spatial heterogeneity of ice crystals and assess the effectiveness of the super-ellipsoidal multi-particle model, a synergistic retrieval of particle shape parameters and ice cloud optical thickness (IOT) was conducted across six tropical cyclone (TC) and cloud cases. The retrieval framework was built upon vector radiative transfer simulations derived from the adding-doubling model, linking POLDER-3 observations with the super-ellipsoidal particle models and IOT. The retrieved particle shapes and IOT were validated by comparing re-simulated radiance with satellite observations. The findings indicate an order-of-magnitude enhancement over single-particle models in retrieval performance, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) for normalized radiance decreasing from [0.0371, 0.1063] to [0.0023, 0.0042], and for polarized radiance reducing from [0.0036, 0.0061] to [0.0008, 0.0018]. The proposed novel method offers substantial improvements in retrieving IOT, contributing valuable insights for advancing ice cloud remote sensing techniques."

 Information on forest structure is needed for many management aspects, from carbon stock evaluation to fire hazard prediction. Such information is increasingly available from remote sensing data, including light detection and ranging (lidar) sensors. However, continuous forest monitoring is hindered by the limited temporal availability of lidar acquisitions. This study focused on integrating temporally consistent optical acquisitions with temporally sparse lidar acquisitions to provide long term information on forest structural characteristics across the peninsular Spain. We evaluated different modeling approaches including machine learning and advanced deep learning models to ascertain their limitations for long-term forest monitoring. Subsequently, annual estimates of forest structural attributes were generated from 1985 to 2024. Across all forests, height (H), canopy cover (FCC), and above ground biomass (AGB) increased by 34 %, 29 % and respectively 17.5 % from the first (1985–1989) to the last lustrum (2019–2024). By biome, the increase in H, FCC and AGB was larger over the Mediterranean (35 %, 33 %, and 18 % respectively) when compared to the Atlantic (33 %, 10 %, and 15 % respectively) forests. For the model training year, deep learning models improved estimation accuracy by 27 ± 2.6 % (mean value across regions and variables) when compared to machine learning models. However, when applied to data from other years (temporal inference), model precision was similar except for height in the Mediterranean were deep learning models improved RMSE estimates by 7 %. Overall, the deep learning models presented significant computational drawbacks when applied to large geographic extents and extensive temporal ranges, substantially increasing both training and prediction times without providing a clear improvement in accuracy compared to machine learning across years. Therefore, the long-term forest database was generated using machine learning models. This database provides a spatially explicit understanding of forest structural changes over nearly four decades, offering a valuable resource for forest management, ecological assessments, and climate-related policy-making."

 Phytoplankton underpin marine food webs and drive essential biogeochemical processes. Their pigment composition serves as a vital indicator of community structure and physiological state. In this study, we developed a multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based model to estimate the concentrations of 26 pigments and infer phytoplankton community structure in global surface waters. By integrating prior knowledge and quantifying through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), we selected a physically meaningful subset of 10 input features to construct pigment inversion models, including environmental parameters such as sea surface temperature (SST), salinity (SSS), and sea surface height (SSH), as well as remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) at seven spectral bands. For 24 pigments, the model achieved high predictive accuracy and strong generalization performance, with an average coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.76 and median absolute percentage difference (MAPD) of 12.01 % under random cross-validation, and slightly lower accuracy under temporal cross-validation (R2 = 0.67; MAPD = 14.35 %). Feature analysis revealed that Rrs, particularly spectral regions encompassing absorption peaks and adjacent gradients, dominated pigment predictions. Moreover, the model captured nonlinear thermal responses of phytoplankton to SST, consistent with known ecophysiological patterns, and reflected synergistic interactions between SST and SSS affecting pigment variability. The inferred phytoplankton community structures, estimated via Diagnostic Pigment Analysis (DPA), showed strong agreement with previous studies, validating the model's ecological reliability. Additionally, Hydrolight simulations based on in situ aph spectra demonstrated that the model performs reliably under water conditions with suspended particulate matter (SPM) ≤ 1 g m−3 and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption at 440 nm is ≤0.25 m−1, maintaining MAPD below 25 %. Our research demonstrates that neural networks operate in a physically informed manner rather than as purely data-driven models, enabling them to represent complex interactions between phytoplankton and ecological environment. This underscores the necessity of designing ecologically informed and physically interpretable input features in remote sensing applications, offering valuable guidance for future biogeochemical modeling efforts."

 In recent years, optical remote sensing imagery has played an increasingly vital role in Earth observation, but cloud contamination exists as an inevitable degradation. Combining synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical data with machine learning offers a promising solution for reconstructing clear-sky satellite imagery. Nevertheless, several challenges persist, including insufficient attention to large cloud cover, difficulties in restoring temporal changes, and limited practicality of deep models. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel deep learning-based cloud removal framework, termed Began+, which integrates bi-temporal SAR-optical data to deal with cloudy images with high cover ratios. The Began+ framework comprises two primary components: a deep network and a flexible post-processing step, combining the strengths of data-driven models for restoring change information and traditional gap-filling algorithms for mitigating radiance discrepancies. First, a bi-output enhanced generative adversarial network, abbreviated as Began, is designed for image synthesis, featuring an enhanced channel-wise fusion block (ECFB) and a multi-scale depth-wise convolution residual block (MDRB). By applying the dual-tasking optimization and co-learning strategy, the Began model identifies potential change areas from bi-temporal SAR and pre-temporal optical inputs, guiding the synthesis of target optical images. Second, a range of cloud masking and gap-filling techniques can be optionally employed to effectively reduce radiometric discrepancies between the synthesized images and the cloudy data, ultimately yielding high-quality, clear-sky imagery. To meet the big data requirements of deep learning, we constructed two globally distributed cloud removal datasets, named BiS1L8-CR and BiS1S2-CR. Supported by these datasets, extensive experiments demonstrated that the Began+ framework effectively captures bi-temporal change features, reconstructing precise surface information in both Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellite images under large cloud cover. Compared to the latest solutions and algorithms, our proposed Began+ framework exhibits significant advantages from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives in both simulated and real experiments. Furthermore, without strict constraints on input timing, the Began+ framework enables accurate reconstruction of large-scale dual-sensor imagery under high-ratio cloud cover, effectively restoring changing surfaces and improving the quality of unsupervised vegetation extraction."

 This paper introduces a general formulation for the fusion of Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) of variable length from several sensors at different spatial resolutions and acquisition times over the same geographical area. In this formulation, all the spectral bands from all the input sensors are predicted at the best input spatial resolution, and at any observed or non-observed acquisition time requested. To address this general problem, an advanced Masked Auto-Encoder training strategy is proposed, utilising two new loss functions: a Linear-Regression Learned Perceptual Image Similarity term to favor high spatial frequency details, and a mask-contrastive term to ignore clouds and other non-informative areas in the input data. This strategy is applied to the training of Temporal Attention Multi-Resolution Fusion of Satellite Image Time-Series (TAMRF-SITS), a novel Deep Learning architecture designed to implement the proposed general formulation. Experiments with joint Landsat-8/9 and Sentinel-2 time-series were conducted on four different tasks from the literature and demonstrate that a single pre-trained TAMRF is on par with or better than existing ad-hoc methods. For instance, TAMRF provides a gain of 0.01 surface reflectance Root Mean Square Error on a Spatio-Temporal Fusion task when compared to competing algorithms, while showing the highest spatial frequency content. Moreover, the proposed method relaxes unrealistic assumptions routinely found in the literature, including: same or similar spectral bands in different sensors, same-day acquisitions, and scale-invariance of the relationship between high and low resolution images. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to achieve this range of capabilities with a single model, without making any of these assumptions.

 Precise estimation of shrub above-ground biomass (AGB) in arid regions is crucial for carbon cycle research and ecosystem assessment. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) -borne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has become a key tool for quantifying three-dimensional vegetation structure and estimating AGB. However, the short stature of arid zone vegetation, combined with sparse and low-quality point clouds acquired by UAV, limits high-accuracy shrub AGB estimation. To address this issue, this study selected Caragana korshinskii, a typical psammophytic shrub in Ordos City, as the research object. By integrating UAV-based multispectral and LiDAR data, a biomass estimation method based on a novel Shrub Structure Index (SSI) was proposed. The SSI workflow reconstructs the three-dimensional shrub structure under sparse point cloud conditions and improves AGB estimation accuracy. This workflow comprises Object-based image analysis (OBIA) classification for individual shrub extraction, Delaunay linear up-sampling, voxel-based partitioning, and dynamic stratification by height percentiles. Experimental results demonstrate that: (1) The individual shrub extraction method utilizing the large-scale mean shift (LSMS) segmentation algorithm and support vector machine (SVM) classification achieved a total quadrat segmentation accuracy of over 90.61 %, an overall classification accuracy of 91.51 % (Kappa = 0.86). (2) In SSI construction, the height-percentile stratification thickness, point-cloud sampling, and voxel edge length together set Caragana korshinskii stratification accuracy and density scale; the 5 % height percentile interval, a sampling size of 100 points, and 0.04 m voxel edge length proved optimal. (3) Comparative experiments showed that the three-dimensional feature integrated SSI significantly outperformed single-feature, two-feature, traditional allometric equation, and random forest (RF) models, with the SSI-based model achieving R2, RMSE, MAE, and rRMSE of 0.90, 529.01 g, 432.58 g, and 26.54 %, respectively.

 Canopy gap fraction (GF) is one of the most important vegetation structure parameters widely used in forest ecology and meteorology. Small-footprint airborne LiDAR has gained great popularity for canopy GF retrieval in the past decade; yet most studies were carried out at individual sites using different commercial-off-the-shelf instruments, often ignoring possible inconsistency due to the use of different instruments or scanning configurations. This study aims to provide an assessment of the performance of canopy GF retrieval from small-footprint airborne LiDAR under different collection scenarios. We utilized small-footprint airborne LiDAR data and field digital hemispherical photo (DHP) measurements from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), encompassing 30 sites across 16 eco-regions in the United States from 2016 to 2022. A total of eight baseline cases together with different instrument configurations were included in this analysis. LiDAR-based canopy GF was first retrieved using established methods and then compared to a total of 4596 DHPs from 383 plots. Results show that all instruments could reach an accuracy better than 10 % RMSE under a proper configuration, however, the difference of using waveforms and point clouds alone could reach an RMSE up to 18 %. Scan angle showed the greatest impact among all sensor related parameters and could lead to a mean bias up to 5 %. Interestingly, waveforms did not always outperform point clouds, likely due either to the varying pulse shape of transmitted waveform or to low digitizer performance. In sum, our results caution the use of airborne LiDAR as the only means for validating large-scale satellite vegetation structure products or monitoring subtle long-term canopy changes. Assessing both instrument and acquisition specifications can help minimize potential bias in canopy GF retrieval over different ecosystems."

 In the 21st century, forest edge-to-interior gradients have exhibited remarkable spatiotemporal variation in China. In this study, we employed a high-resolution framework integrating NDVI, tree cover, canopy height, and forest age to evaluate edge effects on forest growth, structure, and maturity in China from 2000 to 2020. The results revealed that (1) the proportion of forest edges within 60 m declined from 38 % (653,000 km2 out of 1,694,000 km2) in 2000 to 33 % (680,000 km2 out of 2,033,000 km2) in 2020, accompanied by an increase in interior forests (>300 m) from 22 % (381,000 km2) to 29 % (590,000 km2); (2) NDVI, tree cover, canopy height and forest age increased from the forest edge toward the interior, with the strongest effects occurring within 300 m of the edge and detectable up to 1.2 km into the interior. However, the edge forests demonstrated faster temporal increases in NDVI and tree cover; and (3) these effects varied with the land cover types adjacent to the edge. Specifically, NDVI (0.862) and tree cover (81.17 %) peaked at cropland edges and were lowest at grassland edges (0.793 and 41.24 %), while canopy height ranged from 9.77 m at grassland edges to 12.76 m at waterbody edges.

 Accurate accounting of microwave land surface emissivity (MLSE) facilitates applications associated with monitoring the ecohydrological dynamics in global terrestrial ecosystems, quantifying cross-sphere carbon and water exchanges, and meeting the critical accuracy required for assimilation in the global precipitation retrieval algorithm. However, collaborative applications of emissivity retrieved from individual sensors are severely hampered by discrepancies in retrieval techniques, instrumental configurations, calibration errors, and broken temporal periods. To mitigate this gap, we present an innovative framework to retrieve harmonized emissivity from observations of five passive microwave sensors, namely, GPM-CO/GMI, Fengyun-3B, −3C and −3D/MWRI, and GCOM-W1/AMSR2. Six geostationary visible and infrared imagers onboard three geostationary platforms, i.e. GOES-16/ABI, Himawari-8, −9/AHI, and MSG-1, −2, −3/SEVIRI, were collocated to jointly provide clear-sky masks covering the globe. The simultaneous conical overpass (SCO) recalibration technique was applied to scale all emissivity subsets retrieved from different sensors to be aligned with the GMI retrievals across various land types. Quantitative analyses reveal exceptionally strong consistency among emissivities across different subsets (Pearson R ≈ 0.95, RMSD <0.011, and mean bias within ±0.005). Our estimates at 10.65 GHz show strong agreement with in-situ radiometer measurements over two grass and crop fields, with errors generally within ±0.01 at vertical polarization and a systematic underestimation of approximately −0.02 at horizontal polarization. Globally, we evaluate the recalibrated emissivities against four reference datasets derived using various techniques, which includes three single-sensor retrievals from GMI and AMSR-E, as well as a climatology emissivity atlas generated using the Tool to Estimate Land Surface Emissivity at Microwaves and Millimeter waves (TELSEM). The results demonstrate strong consistencies at both vertical (R = 0.8–0.9, RMSD <0.015 or ∼ 1.5 %) and horizontal (R = 0.9–0.95, RMSD <0.02 or ∼ 2 %) polarizations on a monthly scale. The observed discrepancies are primarily attributed to differences in instrumental configurations, calibration accuracy, and retrieval methodologies. The harmonized retrieval algorithm and the sophisticated cross sensor calibrations facilitate its implementation as a self-consistent emissivity data for various applications associated with terrestrial ecohydrological dynamics, surface hydrological properties estimation, as well as the physical-based precipitation retrieval algorithms over land."

 Coastlines serve as dynamic interfaces between terrestrial and marine ecosystems. While advances in satellite remote sensing have promoted coastline monitoring, no comprehensive global coastline dataset derived from Sentinel-2 imagery has been produced, despite its 10-m resolution and frequent revisit capabilities. To address this, we propose S2Coast, a knowledge-based framework based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, designed to automatically detect the unified High Water Line (HWL) from annually composited Sentinel-2 imagery, termed HWLSentinel-2. This method integrates multi-temporal observational information, spectral characteristics, and spatial features to delineate the stable extent of high seawater submergence captured in cloud-free satellite images over a year. The boundaries in the resultant “Land-Water” binarization image represent HWLSentinel-2, derived through integrated threshold segmentation for three decision layers. Subsequently, raster-to-vector conversion and optimization steps were performed. Following the sequential execution of 12,275 sub-tasks, the resultant S2Coast-2023 dataset includes approximately 2.17 million kilometers of coastline for 2023, covering all continents and most islands larger than 100 m2, excluding Antarctica and remote polar islands. Global validation based on 1146 samples demonstrates that the developed tool, S2Coast, exhibits robust stability and universality, with average 88 % of sampled coastline segments falling within a 10-m buffer when comparing repeatedly generated coastlines from consecutive years (2021 to 2023). For positional accuracy, using 532 coastline samples with very high resolution image-based OpenStreetMap coastlines as reference data reveal an average positional deviation of −1.10 m (95 % CI: −2.06 to −0.15 m) and an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 17.40 m (95 % CI: 16.23 to 18.65 m). As the first global coastline dataset with 10-m resolution and a unified coastline indicator, it will serve as a crucial foundational resource for future coastal research."

 Ocean eddies in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) play a crucial role in sea-ice dynamics and polar ocean-atmosphere interactions; however, their detection remains challenging due to their complex surface signatures. In this study, we developed MIZ-EDYOLO, a deep learning model customized for detecting MIZ eddies from dual-polarized Sentinel-1 SAR imagery. Built upon the YOLOv9-t architecture and enhanced with specialized modifications, the model was trained on a dataset containing over 20,000 slices extracted from 1370 SAR images. The MIZ-EDYOLO model achieves high detection accuracy (∼80 % F1-score) on the test set and performs reliably on 200 full-scene images, enabling efficient and automated eddy identification. Using this model, we constructed the first six-year (2018–2023) SAR-based MIZ eddy dataset for the East Greenland region, comprising over 10,000 eddy instances. Analysis of this dataset reveals that eddy distributions are related to boundary currents, topographic forcing, and seasonal variations of the MIZ. Cyclonic eddies (CEs) outnumber anticyclonic eddies (AEs) by a factor of 8.4, while AEs exhibited an average radius about 1.8 times larger than CEs. The observed asymmetries between CEs and AEs are linked to their rotational dynamics and the associated sea-ice responses. This study presents a scalable and operational framework for efficient eddy monitoring in the MIZ, providing new insights into multi-scale oceanographic processes in climate-sensitive polar regions."

 Cloud masking is an essential task for satellite-based Earth monitoring, and the quality of cloud masks can directly impact the solutions of the downstream Earth monitoring tasks. While significant progress has been made especially for data with desired bands (e.g., thermal bands in Landsat-8), the masking quality on small satellites with higher resolution but fewer spectral bands is still unreliable at high latitudes, where confusion with snow and ice makes the task significantly more challenging. We propose a novel learning-enabled cross-platform ability transfer paradigm that offers a scalable and effective solution to tackle this challenge through a case study using PlanetScope images in the Arctic. A unique characteristic of the new paradigm is that it does not require manual annotations to be collected for PlanetScope images, which is often the bottleneck and the most time-consuming part of machine learning-based cloud masking, especially given the similarity between clouds and snow/ice. To realize this, our approach first designs and creates a new training dataset, Co-Clouds, which contains around 45,000 coincident pairs of PlanetScope and Landsat-8 image patches collected within a nearly simultaneous temporal window. This coincident dataset offers a way to generate large volumes of training data and builds a bridge to transfer Landsat-8’s stronger cloud masking skills in the Arctic to PlanetScope images via data-driven learning. We also show the feasibility of the ability transfer from spectral signatures (e.g., thermal bands) to spatial signatures (e.g., textures). Using our Co-Clouds dataset, we train several deep learning models including both regular-size deep learning models and large foundation models. To validate the quality of the masks, we further create a manually labeled cloud mask dataset for PlanetScope images in the Arctic. Both the quantitative and qualitative results show significant improvements over the current operational cloud masks by PlanetScope. For example, the large foundation models such as SegFormer achieve approximately 20 % higher overall accuracy and 28 % higher producer’s accuracy than the operational cloud masks, while maintaining comparable or better user’s accuracy exceeding 90 %. The new approach is also very easy to implement and extend to other platforms, opening new opportunities for broadcasting advanced skills from one platform to others."

 Flood-pulsed wetlands are characterized by significant seasonal water fluctuations, which play a critical role in the dynamics of these sensitive ecosystems. Among the growing number of existing remote sensing products, we explore the potential of interferometric (InSAR) coherence time series, derived from Sentinel-1 synthetic-aperture radar images, to characterize the hydrological dynamics of the Okavango Delta, a vast flood-pulsed wetland. Interferometric coherence reflects changes in surface conditions, making it a powerful tool for detecting flood propagation. By fitting harmonic functions, we produce parameters that quantify the seasonality of coherence time series with short isotemporal baselines (12 days). In particular, we developed a normalized seasonal index based on the ratio between the seasonal amplitude and the root-mean-square error of the fitted harmonic function, to map the seasonality of the coherence time series. A multi-annual analysis of coherence time series reveals a strong relationship between their seasonality, land cover, and flood frequency. Unsupervised clustering applied to statistical and seasonal metrics of coherence time series yields consistent classifications that map the variability of flood frequencies across wetland areas and clearly distinguish wetlands from dry zones. Similarly, thresholds applied to normalized seasonal indices delineate the year-to-year extent of flood pulses with accuracy around 79 %. We show that coherence time series in never flooded areas exhibit a pronounced seasonal pattern driven by rainfall cycle, whereas this seasonality is disrupted by flood pulses in wetlands. Building on this, we developed a change-detection approach to map the floods by identifying the date when coherence time series diverge from their seasonal pattern. The resulting flood arrival dates achieve 74–83 % accuracy compared to a reference dataset derived from optical data. Our results highlight the potential of coherence time series as a robust indicator of seasonal variations in inundation extent in flood-pulsed wetlands."

The spacing between neighbour output vectors was often around 1 km. When combining HH and HV, the resulting ice displacements (over 2 h to 3.5 days) derived for June 1, 2022 – May 31, 2025 were in an excellent agreement with International Arctic Buoy Programme data with the overall root-mean square error (RMSE) of 1.48 km, and correlation of 0.996 for the x and y components. Ice motion vectors provided by HV had consistently greater tracking cross-correlation coefficients (with the average value of 0.56) than those derived from HH (average value of 0.45), implying a higher confidence. The RCM HH + HV ice motion agreed well with the existing passive microwave products from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) and Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) with RMSEs of 4.19 km/d and 5.03 km/d respectively.

A greater number of vectors was derived from HV compared to HH across the pan-Arctic domain, except for the situations where the HV signal is low, such as over smooth land fast ice.

 Recent record-breaking fire activity in the western US poses clear threats to humans, ecosystems, and climate. Larger and faster fires increase the challenges for fire managers and further motivate the need for improved tracking of extreme fire behavior. There are also known limitations to our current ability to monitor fires from space. These include infrequent coverage from moderate resolution (≤ 1 km) sensors, smoke and cloud obscuration, omission of small or low-intensity fires, and atmospheric attenuation of fire radiative power (FRP). These effects diminish our ability to quantify fire behavior and emissions, including persistent burning behind the flaming fire front, particularly in ecosystems with high fuel loads. In this study, we examined the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) imagery and data products to assess the utility of candidate fire pixels in addition to the low/nominal/high confidence 375-m fire detections already included in the active fire product. We found that these candidate pixels added 45% more daytime detections and 12% more nighttime detections for large fires in the western US 2020 fire season. Candidate fires were highly consistent with areas of flaming and smoldering fire activity identified by near-coincident airborne data as well as patterns of known active or candidate fires in sequential VIIRS overpasses, without significantly increasing false detections (commission errors). The candidate fire detections helped fill data gaps due to cloud obscuration during large fires that generated pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) clouds. Including this additional information also impacted estimates of fire activity, increasing fire persistence by 20% and FRP by 7% across our sample. Although the contribution from candidate fire detections to total FRP was relatively small, including these additional pixels could provide a more consistent estimate of fire emissions for smoke models and air quality forecasts by filling gaps in active fire information and improving the representation of smoldering fire activity. These results demonstrate the potential to augment the standard VIIRS product with candidate fire information for known large fire events to improve fire tracking and downstream products. Such approaches to leverage additional VIIRS information may be suitable for other biomass burning regions where global fire detection algorithms provide incomplete information for specific fire types and observing conditions."

 We examine how, over its first decade, the Sentinel-1 mission has advanced the estimation of ocean surface winds over tropical cyclones, supported their global monitoring, and fostered related research. C-band S1 Synthetic Aperture Radar have been instrumental in refining wind retrieval algorithms, relying on the co- and cross-polarized normalized radar cross-section sensitivity to the ocean wind–waves, especially for major category (3-5) tropical cyclones observed in wide swath modes. Systematic comparisons with airborne multi-frequency radiometer measurements confirm the ability of Synthetic Aperture Radar to provide estimates of the ocean surface wind field at kilometer resolution during a tropical cyclone (bias of 0.08 m/s, standard deviation of 3.84 m/s, correlation of 0.97) and to extract its main characteristics, including the center of the wind circulation, the maximum possible extent of a given wind speed around the tropical cyclone and the radius of maximum wind. Now available globally and in near-real time at operational tropical cyclone forecasting centers, Synthetic Aperture Radar observations are part of the mix used to diagnose the state of the tropical cyclones and issue warning bulletins. Sentinel-1 decametric-backscatter and kilometric-wind resolutions have also been shown to be a reference for interpreting and calibrating other satellite, in situ measurements, and algorithms. Sentinel-1 synoptic observations benefit from new observing systems. Their synergistic use enables us to provide improved temporal resolution of TCs inner core structural parameters. Research efforts exploiting Synthetic Aperture Radar measurements to document such a dynamical system, infer tropical cyclone boundary layer properties, TC-generated waves, and interactions with the upper ocean are presented. This growing increase in acquisitions from multiple C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar missions (e.g. the Radarsat Constellation Mission) over TCs (a factor of 4 over the last decade), combined with other observational data and numerical models, opens opportunities to revisit robust data-driven approaches. These advances shall support a better representation of tropical cyclones in digital twin frameworks. Both algorithm improvements on existing and future Synthetic Aperture Radar missions are attractive perspectives to provide more accurate predictions and a deeper understanding of these complex weather systems."

 Swath-based remote sensing data often exhibit spatial discontinuities after mapping to latitude-longitude grids at a regular spacing due to uneven sampling caused by varying viewing angles and limitations of the conventional center point-based gridding method (CPGrid). A more complex area-weighted gridding method can enhance spatial continuity, but it requires geometric calculations for each grid and is computationally intensive, especially for large-scale satellite imagery. To balance accuracy and efficiency, we proposed a probabilistic area-weighted gridding method (PAGrid), which approximates area-weighting by aggregating results from multiple randomized spatial perturbations. The performance of PAGrid was evaluated using all available Sentinel-3A and 3B observations in 2022 over Germany. Using the canopy absorption coefficient by chlorophyll in the red-edge band (αRE) as a test variable, we generated 8-day composites and compared results from CPGrid and PAGrid methods. PAGrid increased the median percentage of valid grid cells from 85% to 93% and reduced temporal fluctuations by 21% compared to CPGrid. Additionally, PAGrid improved the correlation (R2) between Sentinel-3A and 3B αRE from 0.73 to 0.84, indicating enhanced data consistency. These improvements indicate that PAGrid is a practical and efficient approach for generating consistent and continuous gridded time series from swath-based satellite observations."

 Passive satellite products are a primary source for estimating surface total solar radiation (TSR) and its components—direct (DIR) and diffuse (DIF). However, existing satellite-based methods typically treat aerosol and cloud effects separately. Overlooking aerosol-cloud coexistence may introduce substantial uncertainties that have received little attention. Therefore, this study combines radiative transfer simulations, multi-source satellite data, and ground-based validation to systematically evaluate the impact of overlooking coexistence on DIR, DIF, and TSR estimates. Simulations show that as cloud optical thickness increases from 0.2 to 5, the mean DIR overestimation due to ignoring aerosols drops from 261.58 W m−2 to 1.02 W m−2, and DIF shifts from an underestimation of 165.75 W m−2 to an overestimation of 102.41 W m−2. Ignoring clouds in coexistence cases yields similar patterns but greater biases. Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation indicate that about 15 % of global samples exhibit aerosol-cloud coexistence, with hotspots concentrated in central Africa. Ground validation shows that ignoring coexistence increases the relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of AQUA-based DIR, DIF, and TSR estimates by 19.19 %, 26.22 %, and 1.95 %, respectively, and Himawari-8-based estimates by 31.21 %, 30.09 %, and 3.60 %. To mitigate these uncertainties, two strategies are tested. Filling missing aerosol or cloud properties using MERRA-2 or MYD08M3 data reduces DIF rRMSE by 7.17 %–10.45 %; incorporating aerosol-cloud coexistence samples into the lookup table reduces it by 3.30 %. Both strategies have minimal impact on DIR and TSR. These findings highlight significant errors from overlooking aerosol-cloud coexistence in passive satellite-based solar radiation estimates and emphasize the need for greater awareness and methodological refinement."

 Wildfires, intensified by climate change, necessitate advanced methods for accurate and near-real-time fire severity mapping to improve emergency response and post-fire recovery strategies. Satellite remote sensing, combined with supervised learning approaches, enhances the accuracy and efficiency of fire severity mapping. This study introduces Decision-Based Hierarchical Learning (DBHL), a novel multi-sensor fire severity classification model that integrates Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR; Sentinel-1 backscatter) and optical (Sentinel-2 reflectance) data. The model was applied to assess wildfire impacts on temperate forests during the 2019/20 “Black Summer” wildfire season in south-eastern Australia. DBHL incorporated SAR-based RADAR-Vegetation Structure Perpendicular Index (R-VSPI) and optical-based Vegetation Structure Perpendicular Index (VSPI) as candidate indices. By integrating these complementary datasets, DBHL leverages both structural and physiological changes as fire severity indicators, addressing limitations in single-sensor approaches. A pixel-wise approach was employed to spatially upscale the applicability of the R-VSPI and VSPI indices for fire severity assessment across the entire region. Using field data, the sensitivities of the R-VSPI and VSPI indices were validated during the immediate post-fire to one-year post-fire period. DBHL was trained and evaluated with a focus on comparing its performance against independent R-VSPI and VSPI classifications. The findings reveal the unique strengths of each index across various fire severity classes, demonstrating their complementary value. R-VSPI is more sensitive to structural changes in forests, while VSPI excels in identifying changes related to canopy-level disturbances. One-year post-fire recovery analysis shows distinct spatial patterns, with VSPI indicating faster recovery in surface vegetation and R-VSPI highlighting prolonged structural recovery. The DBHL model demonstrates the complementary strengths of the indices, allowing fire severity assessments to be contextualized across vertical vegetation strata, distinguishing between canopy-based damage indicators and underlying structural changes. DBHL outperformed single-sensor approaches, achieving the highest classification accuracy (overall accuracy=88.89%, kappa=0.86), particularly improving differentiation of Moderate (partial canopy scorch) and High (full crown scorch) severity with a producer’s accuracy of 100%, and 80%, respectively. Future research is aimed at integrating multi-wavelength SAR, including L-band (1.25 GHz) and P-band (0.43 GHz), along with LiDAR measurements to enhance structural fire severity assessments."

 Green Area Index (GAI) is a key crop trait obtained through remote sensing with wide applications in agriculture. Although 3D model-driven approaches to retrieve GAI from multispectral reflectance observations are appealing, they are constrained by limitations in the realism of simulated datasets used for training. This study comprehensively explored how to integrate prior information—such as soil background, leaf optical properties, and canopy structure—into radiative transfer models to improve GAI retrieval. A suite of models (MARMIT-2 for soil reflectance, PROSPECT for leaf optical properties, ADEL-Wheat for canopy structure, and LESS for radiative transfer) was employed to generate five simulation datasets incorporating different combinations of prior information. Support Vector Regression (SVR) models were independently trained on these simulated datasets and validated against an extensive data set made of 310 samples of GAI ground measurements and the corresponding SuperDove satellite data. Our results show that stage-specific GAI retrieval integrating detailed prior information on soil and leaf properties (R2 = 0.93, RMSE = 0.47) notably outperforms standard model inversion approaches (R2 = 0.82, RMSE = 0.73). The improved realism of the training dataset stems from three key strategies was discussed in detail including: (1) employing models that integrates physical and biological knowledge; (2) narrowing the training space; and (3) minimizing distribution shifts. While this study focused on GAI estimation for wheat crops using SuperDove observations, the findings can be extended to other crops, vegetation variables, and satellite systems."

 Urban overheating, a confluence of urban heat island and climate change, is escalating alongside the rapid global urbanization. While previous studies have examined how urbanization and vegetation influence surface urban heat islands (SUHI), their nonlinear effects across climate zones remain insufficiently understood. Here, we present a globally consistent assessment of 6022 cities using MODIS Aqua data (MYD11A2) from the summer of 2019, validated with multi-year records (2017–2021), through a self-developed, scalable SUHI quantification method that enables cross-climate comparisons. Our results reveal distinct rapid- and slow-growth zones in SUHI intensification with urban size, with the fastest increase occurring in small cities below the top 20% of global urban size. This uneven rise in SUHI intensity stems from the synergistic effects of urban expansion and vegetation loss. Vegetation cooling exhibits a clear saturation beyond an inflection point, with the equatorial zone showing both weaker cooling efficiency and earlier saturation onset. Using a dual-perspective framework that integrates absolute and relative temperature metrics, we further show that Global South cities experience compounded thermal stress—featuring not only 3.37 ± 0.14 °C higher absolute temperatures due to their geographical setting, but also 0.24 ± 0.05 °C greater SUHI intensity than cities in the Global North. Together, these findings demonstrate that the effectiveness of heat mitigation strategies varies across climates and urbanization stages, underscoring the heightened vulnerability of smaller cities and the need for context-specific, climate-sensitive planning interventions. This study provides a globally integrated yet regionally differentiated understanding of surface urban heat and establishes a planning-relevant framework to guide targeted and climate-sensitive urban heat mitigation strategies."

 Forest ecosystems, covering about one-third of the Earth’s mainland, are vital for providing essential ecosystem services. However, their extent and health are threatened by climate change. Remote sensing has the potential to evaluate the condition and functionality of global forests, but methodological and technological challenges impede the quantitative estimation of forest traits from spaceborne imagery. The development of next-generation sensors and advanced retrieval algorithms offers the chance to overcome these obstacles, though such data and models need development and testing. In this study we investigated and compared the potential of machine learning regression algorithms (MLRA) and hybrid approaches combining MLRA and radiative transfer simulations for the retrieval of forest traits from PRISMA spaceborne imagery. We tested the method in the Ticino Park, a mid-latitude forest located in northern Italy. We conducted an intensive field campaign in the summer of 2022 concurrently with four PRISMA overpasses to collect trait samples for calibrating and validating the retrieval schemes. Our results demonstrated the capability of PRISMA images and hybrid models to accurately quantify Leaf Chlorophyll Content (LCC) (r2=0.67, nRMSE=13.5 %), Leaf Nitrogen Content (LNC) (r2=0.82, nRMSE=9.5 %), Leaf Water Content (LWC) (r2=0.98, nRMSE=3.5 %), Leaf Mass per Area (LMA) (r2=0.93, nRMSE=6.6 %) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) (r2=0.83, nRMSE=11.7 %) in forest ecosystems. Conversely, Leaf Carotenoid Content (Ccx) yielded a lower accuracy (r2=0.43, nRMSE=13.5 %), indicating potential for improvement. The results evidenced a slightly superior performance of hybrid approaches over purely statistical approaches. The application of the models to PRISMA images acquired before and after a severe drought event corroborated the effectiveness of the models to provide reliable estimates in operational conditions. This underscores the valuable role of next-generation models and hyperspectral spaceborne imagery for forest monitoring. To our knowledge, this is the first study to appraise hybrid retrieval schemes with real spaceborne hyperspectral data for mapping multiple forest traits, thereby providing a reference framework for future applications."

 Green tides in the Yellow Sea are recurrent hazardous algal blooms whose optical monitoring is often hindered by cloud cover, while existing SAR approaches remain sensitive to sea state and look-alike targets and frequently require per-scene tuning or curated labels, limiting transferability and temporal consistency. To address this, we develop a label-free, fully automatic Sentinel-1 workflow that operationalizes three empirical signatures of green tides: spatial anomaly pre-location using local standard deviation on VV, edge-guided intensity separation via edge-balanced Otsu, and temporal anomaly screening using Z-scores with adaptive thresholding; an automatic object-level filter then removes non-algal marine targets. Implemented on Google Earth Engine at 10 m resolution, the pipeline delivers rapid processing without manual parameters. Validation shows high mapping accuracy: with a global stratified sample set, F1 equals 0.96 in 2019 and 0.97 in 2021; with a local edge validation set, F1 equals 0.94; in an all-pixel assessment over more than 2.5 billion pixels against a baseline, overall F1 equals 0.91. Qualitative comparisons likewise show fewer omissions of low-contrast filaments and fewer perforations within mats than GA-Net and UDNet. An ablation analysis clarifies the role of each module: the spatial pre-locator supplies contiguous candidates; the edge-guided intensity module sharpens boundaries and limits leakage; the temporal module suppresses transient bright seawater and consolidates persistent mats. Used jointly, the three constraints provide complementary information that yields the most stable cross-year performance and a favorable balance between precision and recall. Overall, the framework offers a simple, scalable, and operational pathway for fine-scale, all-weather monitoring and consistent multi-year assessment of green tides in the Yellow Sea."

 Arid ecosystems occupy about two-fifths of the global land surface, and fluctuations in their productivity play a pivotal role in global carbon sequestration and ecosystem service provision. However, the global-scale effect of desertification expansion on the annual maximum photosynthetic peak has not yet been systematically quantified. In this study, 30-m high-resolution desert cover data (GLCLUC) and multi-source remote-sensing photosynthetic indicators were integrated, using a space-for-time substitution framework to establish a global desertification scenario classification system. We quantitatively evaluated the influence of diverse desert expansion and contraction scenarios on the ecosystem photosynthetic peak (GPPmax). Results indicate that the average GPPmax in high-intensity expansion regions (HIEs) is 8.23 g C m−2 8d−1, whereas medium- to low-intensity expansion regions (MIEs) show a value of 8.95 g C m−2 8d−1. By contrast, medium- to low-intensity contraction regions (MIRs) and high-intensity contraction regions (HIRs) demonstrate markedly higher GPPmax values of 10.64 g C m−2 8d−1 and 17.64 g C m−2 8d−1, respectively. Regarding the photosynthetic peak difference (ΔGPPmax), expansion scenarios (HIEs, MIEs) significantly decrease ecosystem photosynthetic potential, with average ΔGPPmax reductions of 1.19–3.95 g C m−2 8d−1 relative to contraction scenarios (HIRs, MIRs). The most pronounced losses occur in South America, North America, and Eurasia, with South America exhibiting reductions exceeding 6 g C m−2 8d−1. Additionally, ecosystems with initially higher photosynthetic potential experience greater GPPmax declines under intense desert expansion. This study provides the first global-scale evidence revealing how different desertification pathways modify ecosystem photosynthetic peaks and their regional disparities, offering critical scientific support for ecological restoration, carbon sequestration strategies, and land management across arid landscapes."

The dominant drivers of acceleration vary across regions, primarily including ocean warming, increased surface air temperature, and enhanced surface melting. 
 The Antarctic Peninsula (AP) is experiencing rapid mass losses due to global warming in recent decades. Understanding high-resolution seasonal ice speed variability is essential for uncovering the spatiotemporal dynamics of glaciers and ice shelves and their response to ongoing climate change. Here, we present Sentinel-1 satellite-based observations of seasonal flow velocity changes in 581 glaciers on the AP during the period 2018–2023. We find that the glacier surface velocities exhibit an acceleration since the 21st century, with this trend intensifying substantially in recent years. Summer velocity acceleration was particularly pronounced in 2018–2023, with an average increase of 6.22 ± 5.90 % while annual speed increased by > 1.0 %. The summer acceleration of glacier flow was most notable on the Larsen Ice Shelf. Western AP glaciers showed higher velocities and experienced more rapid acceleration than those in the eastern. These changes are primarily driven by warming ocean waters and intensified surface melt. As climate warming persists, the observed acceleration of glacier flow and associated ice shelf mass loss on the AP are projected to persist, depending on the rate and magnitude of future forcing."

 Satellite monitoring of non-optically active nutrients remains an ongoing challenge due to their weak spectral signals. While artificial intelligence (AI) methods can improve estimates by incorporating spatiotemporal information, their dependence on simple geographic coordinates tends to oversimplify the complex dynamics of nutrient distribution in coastal waters, especially in data-sparse regions. To address this gap, we propose the Spatiotemporal Kernel Density Estimation Deep Neural Network (ST-KDE-DNN). This model leverages precomputed spatial influence fields, derived from river outlet locations using KDE, as direct inputs to establish a source-driven spatial prior that reflects complex mixing patterns. We applied the ST-KDE-DNN framework to retrieve Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (DIN) and Phosphorus (DIP) from Landsat-8/9 imagery in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), a typical multi-outlet coastal system. Compared with models incorporating standard spatiotemporal predictors, incorporating the KDE achieved significantly higher precision, with a reduced Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 45% for DIN and 29% for DIP, respectively. The most prominent improvements occurred in complex mixing zones where river plumes overlap. Furthermore, Explainable AI (XAI) analysis confirmed that the KDE features were dominant predictors, which enhances model transparency and grounds its predictions in physical processes. Based on this framework, we generated high-resolution time series of DIN and DIP for the PRE, and further revealed their seasonal and inter-annual variabilities. The ST-KDE-DNN offers a scalable, physically-informed, and interpretable solution for advancing nutrient monitoring in complex estuarine and coastal systems worldwide."

 The depth of melt ponds upon Arctic sea ice is a critical indicator for understanding the state of sea ice and the progression of climate change. The advent of the ICESat-2 lidar altimeter offers a promising avenue to monitor melt ponds, and existing studies are capable of detecting melt pond location and depth. Here we propose a novel approach that incorporates ICESat-2 photon positioning and elevation uncertainties. By converting the photon elevation distribution along the satellite track into a two-dimensional image where horizontal and vertical axes represent track distance and elevation, we employ image classification techniques to distinguish the surface and bottom of melt ponds. This provides a fully automated method for identifying melt ponds, and then the estimation of their depths. Converting photon information into images effectively simplifies the computation. We tested this method on 100 randomly distributed melt pond samples of varying sizes and depths. Out of these, 97 melt ponds were successfully identified. A comparison with manually annotated data revealed an average absolute bias of 5 cm and a correlation coefficient of 0.86, outperforming other methods. This approach can detect large and deep melt ponds with widths greater than 17 m and depths ranging from 0.3 to 2 m, which can be further used to monitor the melt ponds in the whole Arctic. It facilitates the acquisition of more detailed melt pond depth information, which is crucial for quantifying the surface melt of Arctic sea ice."

 Tracking moving vehicles in satellite videos presents several challenges, including complex background interference and the difficulty of detecting small targets. Most existing multiple object tracking (MOT) methods utilize convolutional models to capture local semantics or self-attention mechanisms to address global semantics for moving target detection. However, these methods tend to struggle with small and visually similar targets, making them particularly vulnerable to complex background interference, which often results in a large number of false positives and missed detections. Furthermore, many current approaches rely on the Hungarian matching algorithm or other intricate, unlearnable association optimization methods to achieve effective tracking once relevant information is gathered. This reliance often yields suboptimal outputs from the network models. To tackle these issues, this article presents an end-to-end graph network based on spatiotemporal high-order relation learning and reasoning for vehicle tracking in satellite video. The representation module of spatial high-order relations is designed to capture the spatial high-order relations between moving vehicles and their local environments, as well as global key references. Meanwhile, the temporal semantic reasoning module focuses on analyzing the evolution of these spatial high-order relations over time, thereby constructing the spatiotemporal high-order connections among the targets of interest and ensuring the continuous and stable detection of moving vehicles. Ultimately, a graph network based on spatiotemporal high-order relation reasoning is developed to perform learnable associations of target information across video frames, achieving a globally optimal solution to the tracking problem. Comparative experiments on the SatVideoDT, CGSTL, and ShuangQing-1 satellite video datasets demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enables end-to-end tracking of moving vehicles, attaining state-of-the-art performance across most evaluation metrics. On the SatVideoDT dataset, the model achieves a Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) of 65.1% and an Identity F1 Score (IDF1) of 70.9%. The proposed network model holds significant promise for the automated interpretation of satellite video data. The code is available at https://github.com/zsspo/GHOST-R."

 Malaria, a life-threatening disease, remains a major global health challenge, particularly in Africa. While Anopheles gambiae sensu lato has long been the primary vector in Africa, the recent invasion of Anopheles stephensi—an urban malaria vector native to South Asia, poses a growing threat to malaria control and elimination efforts. Understanding An. stephensi environmental suitability and its spread dynamics is critical for designing effective surveillance and vector control strategies. Although previous studies have mapped potential environmental suitability for An. stephensi, most have focused on temperature or environmental variables, overlooking other critical factors affecting mosquito life cycles. Moreover, little is known about the species’ historical spread speed or projected expansion. While An. stephensi is already spreading in the region, this study aims to enhance predictive modeling of suitable habitats and identify areas at ongoing or future risk of invasion. Our approach integrates meteorological, environmental, geophysical, and socioeconomic variables, alongside an expanded occurrence dataset and ecologically constrained pseudo-absence sampling. The model achieved an accuracy of 0.93 in predicting An. stephensi locations during the 2021–2024 test period, outperforming previous studies in the region. We analyzed historical spread patterns, revealing a rapid increase in spread speed from 20 km/year in 2012 to over 120 km/year by 2024. Future spread was projected using environmental suitability, road connectivity, and population density, with the spread model achieving a temporal correlation of 0.66. Projections suggest continued expansion into western Ethiopia, southern Somalia, and southern Kenya, with climate change likely to increase environmental suitability in highland regions. This high-resolution, spatiotemporal framework provides actionable insights for current and future transmission hotspots and supports urgent, targeted interventions to mitigate the spread of An. stephensi under a changing climate."

 The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission has significantly advanced marine gravity recovery, yet its wide-swath measurements reveal the effects of strong sea level variability, emphasizing the need for effective correction methods. This study reveals that traditional correction strategies, such as stacking method, are insufficient for SWOT gravity recovery in high-variability environments, and quantifies the conditions under which more targeted correction approaches are necessary. Experimental results in the Kuroshio indicate that strong sea level variability directly affects SWOT observations, leading to gravity anomaly disturbances of approximately 2 mGal. To mitigate these disturbances, two strategies are implemented: stacking and sea level anomaly (SLA) model correction. Using SLA model correction, deflection of the vertical (DOV) accuracy improves by ∼40 % in regions of strong sea level variations, while gravity anomaly accuracy is enhanced by 0.25 mGal (∼9%). To determine the conditions under which correction becomes necessary, this study evaluates gravity anomaly accuracy across varying sea level variability levels, quantified by the standard deviation of sea level anomaly (STD-SLA). Results show that when STD-SLA is below 15 cm, gravity recovery remains largely unaffected. However, above this threshold, SLA-induced disturbances become non-negligible, and applying correction improves gravity anomaly accuracy by more than 0.1 mGal on average.

 Compound drought and heatwave events (CDHEs), as critical extreme climate phenomena, have attracted substantial scientific attention because of their profound impact on the sustainability of socioecological systems. Nevertheless, current identification methods rely only on the combined influence of precipitation and temperature changes and fail to consider the contribution of evapotranspiration in drought‒heatwave. This resulted in a low estimation of the spatial extent and severity of such compound events. Here, we developed a new standardized compound drought and heatwave index (SCDHI) using the Gaussian copula probability distribution modeling, combining the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) with the standardized temperature index (STI). We found that compared with the existing indicator, the SCDHI improved significantly in monitoring accuracy and monitoring capability for CDHEs, particularly in assessing vegetation responses. By explicitly considering the impact of evapotranspiration on the intensification of droughts, the SCDHI effectively corrected the underestimated deviations that are commonly present in traditional methods in vegetation areas. The proposed index demonstrates strong potential for multiscale monitoring of CDHEs, enhancing assessments of their impact on the environment and society."

 Recent climate warming has accelerated permafrost thaw and dynamics of thermokarst lakes (TLs) on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Yet, owing to the lack of long-term monitoring of TLs, our understanding of lake evolution processes and their driving factors remains uncertain. Here, using the global surface water product and time-series Landsat imagery, we identified 58,538 TLs (0.01–3 km2) and determined the primary occurrence year of lake changes from 1990 to 2022. Our results indicated that TLs on the TP are primarily located in the central inland region, over 82 % of lakes experienced area expansion, and only 15 % in the northwest show decrease in area. Annual number of lake expansion peaked in 2016, whereas lake shrinkage was most common in 2019. The calculated lake area errors, field investigations, and validation of lake disturbance time demonstrated high accuracy and consistency. We applied the optimal machine learning regression model to distinguish the different drivers for lake expansion and shrinkage. The topographic and climatic factors are primary drivers for lake expansion, while differences in evaporation trend and soil temperature trend might contribute to lake shrinkage. This study highlights the vulnerability of permafrost on the TP to climate change, which can contribute to carbon sequestration estimation and infrastructure maintenance."

 Advances in artificial intelligence have enabled the automation of many remote sensing tasks; however, performance remains constrained by dataset quality, especially for fine-grained ship classification in remote sensing imagery, where publicly available datasets suffer from class imbalance and sample scarcity. To address these issues, we propose a novel simulation-to-real style-transfer pipeline for fine-grained ship imagery, comprising three modules: the Simulation Image Generation (SIG) module, the Conditional Image Generation (IG) module, and the Wake Inpainting (WI) module. In the SIG module, we construct an optical remote sensing imaging system capable of producing high-resolution simulated images containing fine-grained ship objects. To overcome the loss of detailed features inherent in global style-transfer methods, the IG module introduces the SPAM-ControlNet algorithm, which generates fine-grained ship images with accurate characteristics. In the WI module, we generate the inpainting region at the stern based on the ship wake model, then apply Stable Diffusion Inpainting to synthesize realistic wake patterns, thereby harmonizing the generated ship objects with the ocean background. This pipeline enables the synthesis of seamless, high-resolution remote sensing images populated with detailed ship objects. Building on this pipeline, we also release a hybrid dataset, FGSCR-SR-12, which combines real and synthetic images across 12 ship classes to mitigate long-tail distribution challenges caused by scarce classes.

 Cloud cover constitutes a formidable obstacle in the field of optical remote sensing image processing, substantially impeding the extraction and utilization of surface information. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, serving as a complementary informational resource, is capable of furnishing crucial auxiliary data for optical images. In recent years, diffusion-based cloud removal methodologies have made significant progress. Nevertheless, their inherent generative diversity and randomness pose challenges in meeting the realism requirements for cloud removal in optical remote sensing imagery. To address this, this paper presents a SAR-guided optical imagery cloud removal method based on global–local interaction and conditional consistency-constrained diffusion models (GLCdiffcr). Specifically, the method integrates a multi-scale residual self-attention network in the denoising module. This network captures both global and local details of SAR imagery and the captured details provide precise guidance for cloud removal. Additionally, within the reverse diffusion framework, the method directly predicts cloud-free optical images and iterates over multiple steps, reducing errors caused by generative randomness and improving consistency. Meanwhile, in order to enhance the realism of the generated images, the method employs a novel multi-condition consistency-constrained loss function, which combines pixel-level errors with structural similarity measures. Through this loss function, the gap between the generated images and real-world land cover types is further minimized. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, particularly in complex regions, with higher accuracy and reliability."

 Seagrass meadows are vital blue carbon ecosystems that protect shorelines, support biodiversity and store carbon, but they face accelerating losses from environmental change and human disturbance. Disentangling these drivers is particularly challenging in data-scarce and operationally difficult regions such as the Nansha Islands. This study proposes SeagrassMNet, a physics-informed, domain-adaptive deep model for shallow-water seagrass mapping. The network couples dual attention transformers with adversarial domain adaptation to handle spectral variability and sparse in situ labels. Applied to multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery, SeagrassMNet achieved an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 92.56 %, outperforming several state-of-the-art models (UNet++, HRNet, DeepLab v3+, ViT-Adapter-L, SegFormer and Swin Transformer V2). Cross-reef and cross-year tests, together with cross-regional point-based checks on open data (SeagrassSpotter), indicate that the model has promising transferability across broad areas and complex marine environments. The resulting maps provide the first comprehensive record of seagrass distribution for the Nansha Islands and reveal a 47.7 % decline in seagrass cover from 2019 to 2023. Association analyses over this period indicate that environmental factors, particularly sea surface temperature anomalies and sea surface height variability, are systematically correlated with spatial and temporal patterns of seagrass change. Large-scale artificial island construction and coastal modification show even stronger correlations with observed losses, especially where reclamation footprints overlap mapped seagrass meadows, underscoring the need for spatially targeted management in these vulnerable reef systems."

 Accurate estimation of grassland aboveground biomass (AGB) is crucial for terrestrial carbon cycling, global climate change research, degradation assessment, and sustainable land management. This study employs XGBoost model, combined with feature selection via Random Forest & Pearson correlation, alongside SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to enhance AGB predictions across diverse grassland ecosystems in China. Results indicate that incorporating vegetation height significantly improves model performance, increasing test R2 values by 0.01–0.07 (final range: 0.59 to 0.68), and reducing the errors nRMSE to ≤ 0.04. This underscores the critical role of vegetation height in improving biomass estimation accuracy. SHAP analysis further reveals the relative importance of key predictors, offering insights into their individual contributions to model performances. Spatiotemporal analysis (2001–2021) reveals rising AGB trends in highly productive regions, whereas arid and degraded grasslands exhibit stability or continue to decline, highlighting their vulnerability to climatic changes and anthropogenic pressures. Although the model demonstrates strong predictive capability, regional heterogeneity and complex feature interactions warrant further investigation. This research highlights the effectiveness of machine learning combined with remote sensing in monitoring grassland degradation, providing valuable insights for ecosystem restoration, carbon sequestration strategies, and policy-driven conservation efforts."

 Gap probability (P) is a key indicator of vegetation canopy structure and can be effectively estimated using intensity data from airborne laser scanning (ALS) point clouds. However, point cloud intensity is highly susceptible to radiometric effects. Even for a specific natural target, its intensity can vary across three-dimensional space, which may reduce the accuracy of P estimation. To address this issue, we propose a novel method for estimating P that corrects the influence of radiometric effects on point cloud intensity (PRE_COR). The method consists of the following main steps: first, laser pulses are classified into vegetation-ground, pure-vegetation, and pure-ground pulses. Then, the intensity of vegetation-ground pulses is corrected using the inverse distance square law and the cosine law of incidence angle. Finally, the corrected intensity values are used to estimate the vegetation-ground reflectance ratio based on a linear relationship between their return energies. This ratio is then used to calculate the canopy P. The proposed method was evaluated using both simulated ALS point cloud data and (National Ecological Observatory Network) NEON ALS point cloud data. The results show that for the simulated data, under varying canopy cover, flight altitudes, and mean scan angles, the proposed method achieved relative root mean square errors (rRMSE) below 5.37%, 5.94%, and 21.51%, and mean absolute errors (MAE) below 0.025, 0.011, and 0.067, respectively. Compared with the traditional PFitted method, rRMSE was reduced by up to 1.90%, 1.94%, and 21.20%, and MAE decreased by up to 0.010, 0.003, and 0.096, respectively. For the NEON ALS data, when the scan angle exceeded 20°, the proposed method may improv accuracy by more than 5.39%, with possible MAE improvements exceeding 0.019. Overall, these results demonstrate that correcting radiometric effects on point cloud intensity can substantially enhance both the accuracy and stability of canopy P estimation, with particularly notable benefits under large scan angle conditions."

 Road infrastructure plays a vital role in national and regional development, particularly in Southeast Asia, where rapid economic growth is increasing pressure on transport systems. However, uneven investment, environmental stressors, and limited data-driven tools continue to hinder effective road maintenance planning. Previous studies have utilized remote sensing and statistical models for infrastructure analysis, but the integration of long-term environmental indicators with spatial prioritization methods remains limited. This study addresses this gap by developing a Road Maintenance Priority Index (RMPI) using ten parameters, including nighttime lights, population density, industrial zones, land surface temperature, precipitation, and wind speed. These variables were analyzed through machine learning regression and multi-criteria decision analysis to classify road segments into priority levels. Results show that 45.08 percent of roads fall into the low-priority category, followed by moderate (39.69 percent), high (9.06 percent), and very high (0.88 percent). Countries such as Singapore, Brunei, and Malaysia exhibited the highest RMPI scores, reflecting urgent maintenance needs, while Timor-Leste, Myanmar, and Laos scored lowest. The findings offer a transferable and scalable framework to support evidence-based infrastructure planning in economically and environmentally diverse regions."

 Individual tree-level fine-scale (especially stem- and branch- scales) structural parameters constitute a critical foundation for tree structural trait assessments, biomass component estimations and tree physiological property evaluations. However, the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Laser Scanning (ULS) has limitations in sampling distance and penetrating capability in dense tree canopies, thus restricting its ability to extract detailed stem- and branch-scale structural parameters. The emergence of both advanced ULS and Backpack Laser Scanning (BLS) technologies have potential to precisely extract fine-scale structural parameters of individual trees. In this study, we proposed an advanced ALE-CS-NGMS approach for individual tree (Poplar (Populus spp.)) stem- and branch- scale structural parameters extraction by ULS and BLS point clouds. First, an Adaptive Least-squares Ellipse (ALE) fitting algorithm was developed to accurately derive the stem diameter of individual trees. Second, a Canopy-stem Separation (CS) model was built by identifying canopy point cloud through derivatives based on the vertical distribution profile of individual trees, while canopy volume was delineated by the AlphaShape as well as a voxel-based algorithm. Finally, a method integrating Neighborhood Graphs and Minimum Spanning (NGMS) was developed to extract individual tree stem, and stem taper curves were fitted to estimate individual-tree stem volume. The results demonstrated that the developed ALE approach yielded a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.87 cm, representing an accuracy enhancement approximately 0.47 cm for DBH estimation. The NGMS approach produced RMSEs of 0.33 m3 and 0.40 m3 for stem volume estimation by using BLS and BLS + ULS data. The CS model achieved RMSEs of 6.48 m3 and 3.48 m3 for canopy volume estimation with the BLS and BLS + ULS data, respectively. Branch inclination angles exhibited an increase with stand age, generally ranging between 60° and 100°. The distribution of branch inclination across stands of varying ages revealed that in the 8-year-old and 12-year-old plots, branch angles fell within the 60°-90° interval."

 Global wetlands are experiencing severe degradation due to climate change and human activities. Under the Ramsar Convention, the Wetland City Accreditation promotes cities to protect and sustainably manage their urban wetlands. The accreditation system was launched in 2015. To date, 43 cities worldwide have obtained this certification, whose dynamic assessment depends on precise mapping of land use and wetlands. Existing global land cover datasets often show low accuracy in identifying wetlands and limited capacity to characterize wetland types within urban areas. we developed a hybrid Wetland City Map (WCM), by fusing three global 10 m-resolution products: Dynamic World, ESA WorldCover, and ESRI Land Cover. We applied a Weighted Voting and Knowledge-based Decision Rule method to achieve this fusion. This method overcomes the limitations of the input datasets by combining their complementary strengths to improve overall wetland classification and by applying expert-derived rules to enhance the delineation of wetland types within cities. The WCM achieves an average overall accuracy of 86.93 % and a kappa of 0.825. In all cities, its accuracy surpasses the three land cover products by 2 %-26 %. The visual comparison shows WCM performs better in wetland classification and spatial detail, with F1 scores of 90.33 % (water), 64.09 % (marsh), 71.67 % (tidal flat/flooded flat), and 92.17 % (mangrove). It more accurately reflects wetland coverage and changes. Wetland coverage varies across cities, with higher coverage in Asia and lower in Europe and Africa.

 Growing demands in sustainable development and resource management are driving increasing reliance on remote sensing-based Earth observation and image interpretation.

 The precise prediction of dam deformation is essential for ensuring infrastructure safety and mitigating geohazards, particularly in regions characterized by limited monitoring studies. This research concentrates on the Oldman River Dam in Alberta, Canada, where Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR)-based deformation monitoring and prediction remain inadequately explored. A novel framework that integrates a Graph Attention Network with Long Short-Term Memory (GAT-LSTM) has been developed to address the limitations of existing methods, which neglect spatial dependencies among InSAR-derived points and the increased model complexity stemming from point clustering or InSAR time series decomposition. Sentinel-1 data from three passes were processed utilizing a full-resolution InSAR technique, resulting in semi-vertical deformation velocities that demonstrated consistent subsidence along the dam crest, with rates fluctuating from 5.08 to 6.23 mm/yr. A robust correlation between deformation and reservoir water levels was noted, with accelerated crest deformation during the 2017–2019 drawdown period and a potential risk identified due to a significant decline in water levels projected for 2023–2024. The GAT-LSTM model, which captures both spatial and temporal dynamics, outperformed the standard LSTM, achieving 83.64% accurate points compared to 76.90% for the LSTM in short-term forecasting, exhibiting notable reliability along the crest. The peak performance was observed on September 9, 2021, with a Root Mean Square Error of 0.30 ± 0.013 mm and a Mean Absolute Error of 0.22 ± 0.012 mm. The proposed framework would enhance dam safety monitoring by providing actionable short-term predictions, demonstrating potential transferability to other slow-moving infrastructure."

 A semi-empirical method based on ancillary and remotely sensed data, NDVI-Cws, is currently applied over the Tuscany region to yield daily actual evapotranspiration (ETa) estimates at moderate spatial resolution (250 m) for a 20-year period (2005–2024). The outcome of this exercise is then statistically analysed in comparison with two similar ETa products provided by the MODIS and LSA SAF systems at 500 m and 5 km resolutions, respectively. The analysis relies on the triple collocation strategy and comprises the following two steps: i) examination and inter-comparison of the spatial and temporal ETa variations which occur in 12 areas of the region representative of different climatic conditions and biome types; ii) repetition of these operations at pixel level. The experimental results indicate the existence of clear spatial and temporal ETa variations over most of the region which are differently represented by the three ETa products. The MODIS ETa estimates are significantly higher and lower than those of the other two products for forest and non-forest areas, respectively; the ETa trends estimated by MODIS are poorly concordant with those of the other products, particularly for forests. Consequently, the MODIS ETa estimates reflect only marginally the ETa increases which are evidenced by the other two methods over most of the region. Out of these methods, NDVI-Cws allows a more spatially detailed prediction of the local ETa variability depending on the NDVI dataset used. The implications and consequences of these findings are finally discussed, together with the main future research prospects."

 Satellite radar altimeters were originally designed for water applications, but their echoes over land surfaces remain less well understood. In this study we analyze how Sentinel-3 (S3) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) altimetry waveforms respond to different surface types and what physical characteristics are encoded in the signal. To probe this, we conduct classification experiments with a feature-enhanced one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and analyze its performance. Since surface type information is relevant for climate, hydrology, and biodiversity applications, understanding these signal responses shows to what extent altimetric waveforms may provide consistent class-specific information despite their large elliptical footprint and heterogeneous landscapes. This study investigates the response of Sentinel-3 altimetry waveforms to different land cover types by employing a 1D-CNN to extract land cover information, complemented by a visual analysis of waveform patterns in relation to surface structures. Our results show that information about the underlying surface is embedded in the signals and can be extracted. They further reveal the sensitivity of Sentinel-3 altimetry to variations in land cover. By enhancing our 1D-CNN model with shape-based and contextual features, it effectively captures surface characteristics despite the large altimeter footprint. An ablation study highlights the complementary role of these features, as their removal negatively impacts performance. The best-performing 1D-CNN achieves a macro-averaged F1 (Macro-F1) score of 0.57 and an overall accuracy of 0.67, outperforming both a random forest and a dummy baseline. The classification includes six surface types: Tree, Shrub, Grass, Crop, Bare/Sparse Vegetation, and Water. Although some misclassification occurs, particularly in transition zones and among classes with similar vegetation structures and soil properties, the model provides valuable insights into systematic waveform behavior, highlighting the potential of SAR altimetry signals to capture broad surface characteristics."

 Multitemporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image change detection (CD) represents a significant focus in remote sensing interpretation research. Recently, matrix low-rank decomposition theory has gained popularity in this field to exploit inherent structural information without requiring annotated data. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on an idealized assumption that defines changed regions as spatially localized and sparse. This assumption introduces critical theoretical limitations: its sensitivity to change scales results in sparsity constraints failing to characterize large-scale continuous changes and accumulating decomposition errors, while the neglect of low-rank coupling between changed regions and backgrounds further undermines theoretical completeness. To address these issues, we propose a Foreground and Background dual-path collaborative optimization CD framework, namely FBCD. Specifically, a foreground change saliency model is constructed under generalized low-rank constraints, integrating low-rank consistency and local correlation mechanisms to capture complex change patterns. In addition, a background stability model based on low-rank self-representation learning achieves precise background separation through multi-view consistency constraint. Once generating reconstructed difference map, a self-supervised graph-optimized label propagation algorithm is designed to transform binary classification into a graph partitioning optimization problem, which further improves the CD accuracy. Extensive experiments on seven bitemporal benchmark datasets validate the superiority of the proposed method: Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, it achieves average Kappa coefficient improvements of 2.50% for large-scale continuous changes and 4.48% for small-scale localized complex changes. Furthermore, the method also shows strong applicability in short-term time series datasets. The source code will be made available at https://github.com/95xiaoli/FBCD."

 Remote sensing-detected phenological differences among cover crops, cash crops, and soil backgrounds are crucial for detecting cover cropping practices. However, variations in detection performance with satellite data of different spatial, temporal, and radiometric characteristics and the potential factors affecting the performance remain unclear. Building on the previously developed framework, we aimed to evaluate the performance of multiple satellite sensors, leverage multi-scale ground truth data, and identify potential factors for improving field-level cover cropping detection. Specifically, we (1) compared widely-used NDVI time series from Harmonized Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 (HLS, ∼3-day and 30 m), MODIS (daily and 250 m), and PlanetScope (near-daily and 3 m, requiring radiometric calibration), (2) quantified discrepancies between county-level data from National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) and field-level data from Indiana State Department of Agriculture (ISDA), and (3) analyzed the impacts of cover cropping field sizes, regional adoption rates, and cover crop species on cover cropping detection. We found that (1) HLS outperformed MODIS and MODIS-calibrated PlanetScope (CPS) with an average accuracy of 76.2 % ± 3.0 % across Indiana in 2017. (2) Significant discrepancies between ISDA and NASS data were found in 9 % of counties and were negatively correlated with detection accuracies in counties where ISDA-reported adoption was substantially higher than that reported by NASS (r = -0.54, p < 0.005). (3) Detection accuracy was higher in larger cover cropping fields, positively correlated with regional adoption rates (r = 0.42 and p < 0.001), with the highest accuracy for wheat (88.95 %), followed by winter grains (77.73 %), ryegrass (75.52 %), barley (75.35 %), and cereal rye (68.59 %).

 Monitoring mangrove forest degradation is challenging compared to deforestation because degradation involves the loss of ecosystem structure and function without changing forest cover, and selecting appropriate degradation references is difficult. Existing remote sensing time-series approaches offer a practical way to monitor forest degradation, but they mainly monitor degradation that occurred after images became available and focus on the forest’s horizontal dimension. This study proposes a novel approach for quantifying mangrove forest degradation. The approach evaluates the degree of mangrove degradation by comparing degradation indicators (canopy cover, canopy height, and aboveground biomass) with benchmark values inside environmentally homogeneous land capacity sub-regions. The benchmark values are determined by combining the LandTrendr algorithm and land capacity knowledge, accounting for temporal and spatial reference types. Large-area mangrove degradation indicators were estimated using improved hierarchical models with a “feed-forward” strategy. We applied this approach to mangrove forests on Hainan Island, China. The results showed that the overall accuracy of degradation identification was 95%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.90. The overall mangrove degradation degree in 2022 was 30.78% on Hainan Island, with reductions of 38.01% in canopy height, 28.04% in canopy cover, and 26.27% in aboveground biomass, indicating that mangrove dwarfing was the most serious degradation issue. Protected areas exhibited lower degradation (29.89%) than unprotected areas (35.31%). The findings also showed that the approach successfully detected degradation signals earlier than those from traditional satellite remote sensing data could to a certain extent (e.g., Landsat imagery dating back to ∼1985). The R2 values (RMSE) for the canopy height, canopy cover, and biomass models were 0.72 (1.03 m), 0.85 (0.11), and 0.69 (43.99 Mg/ha), respectively. The proposed approach can be an alternative to time series-based methods when mangrove degradation has a long-term history and can provide critical information to support mangrove conservation and restoration efforts."

 Under rapid urbanization, traditional single-class LCZ mapping methods fail to represent the coexistence of multiple land-cover types within the same block, resulting in blurred boundaries and reduced accuracy for urban heat-island modeling. To address this, LCZ mapping is reformulated as a mixed-scene unmixing task and tackled with a novel deep-learning framework, MSU-Net. Real street-block morphologies from OpenStreetMap are combined with 1 m Google Earth imagery to create multi-scale inputs that preserve both global block layouts and local detail. MSU-Net comprises a primary unmixing branch reinforced by two auxiliary guidance branches—one driven by purified-image semantic cues, the other by sparse local spatial reconstruction, and a Dual Cross-Attention Fusion (DCAF) module that integrates global–local and global–purified features under non-negativity and sum-to-one constraints. Two block-level datasets covering Wuhan and Shenzhen were created. MSU-Net outperforms existing methods on these datasets, boosting overall accuracy by 15–17 %, reducing mean absolute error by over 35 %, and cutting weighted-difference error by around 30 %.

 Accurate mapping of photovoltaic (PV) power plants is critical for monitoring the development of solar energy generation and supporting PV operational management, policy-making, and environmental analysis. However, existing geospatial datasets of PV power plants are either limited in spatial coverage, insufficient in resolution and accuracy, or outdated and lack timely updates, thus failing to meet these demands. To address this, we develop an efficient framework for global PV mapping that integrates the proposed adaptive normalized difference photovoltaic index (ANDPI) with a multi-source data fusion algorithm to extract accurate contours of PV power plants from Sentinel-2 imagery. We generate the global mapping product of PV power plants at 10 m resolution from 2019 to 2025. This mapping achieves an overall accuracy of 91.16 %, outperforming existing PV mapping products, while maintaining the processing speed of 140 km2 per second. Our analysis reveals that the global PV area expanded from 8432 km2 in 2019 to 16289 km2 in 2025, with China contributing 61 % of the growth. Besides, PV power plants are primarily deployed on rangeland (44.0 %) and cropland (40.1 %). Cropland held a slight dominance before 2021, after which rangeland accounted for a larger proportion. To the best of our knowledge, this geospatial dataset represents the most comprehensive global PV mapping product, offering the global spatial coverage, the highest resolution, and the most up-to-date information. It provides valuable insights into the spatial distribution and expansion of PV power plants, contributing to global strategies for carbon neutrality and sustainable development.

 Nighttime light imagery plays a crucial role in diverse applications such as urban planning, environmental monitoring, and economic analysis. Although NPP-VIIRS provides a long and continuous Nighttime light time series, its relatively low spatial resolution limits detailed spatial analysis. Achieving Nighttime light data with both high spatial and temporal resolution remains a key challenge. This study investigates the effectiveness of several deep learning–based super-resolution (SR) models for enhancing NPP-VIIRS Nighttime light imagery using Luojia1-01 data as high-resolution reference imagery. Five representative models—ESPCN, RDN, SRFBN, SwinIR, and RealESRGAN—were selected to cover a range of network architectures including CNN, RNN, ResNet, DenseNet, Transformer, and GAN. A paired SR dataset was constructed from Luojia1-01 and NPP-VIIRS images, and the selected models were trained and evaluated on this dataset. Model performance was assessed across different urban scales and lighting conditions (e.g., dense urban cores, road networks) using PSNR, SSIM, FSIM, and the 95th percentile metrics. Results indicate that model performance varies substantially across scene types, with RealESRGAN showing superior detail recovery and overall image quality (PSNR = 31.96, SSIM = 0.85, FSIM = 0.85). The 95th percentile distribution of the RealESRGAN-enhanced images closely matches that of high-resolution reference data. These findings demonstrate that deep learning–based SR methods can substantially improve the spatial resolution and visual quality of NPP-VIIRS Nighttime light imagery, enabling finer-scale analysis of urban structures and temporal dynamics. This work provides an effective technical framework for reconstructing historical high-resolution Nighttime light data and expanding their applicability in urban, environmental, and socioeconomic studies."

 Accurate measurement of soil moisture content has significant scientific value and social benefits for studying global or regional water cycle mechanisms, developing climate and hydrological models, and advancing sustainable agricultural development. The Alpha approximation algorithm is regarded as one of the primary representatives among change detection methods and has been widely applied in soil moisture inversion. However, as the inversion time extends, the accumulation and propagation of inversion errors lead to a decrease in the inversion accuracy of the alpha approximation algorithm. In this study, three soil moisture observation networks, Tianjun, Nagqu, and Daman, in northwestern China are used as the research region. The optimization of the constraint strategy of the Alpha approximation algorithm is conducted by combining the Dubois model and Juxtaposition approach. The underdetermination issue of the Alpha approximation algorithm is also resolved by incorporating multi-angle synchronous observations to enrich the number of effective equations. Finally, we obtain an improved Alpha approximation algorithm based on the above approaches, and its inversion accuracy is also validated in the three study areas. Compared to the original alpha approximation algorithm, the improved algorithm demonstrates a significant enhancement in inversion accuracy. The RMSE, Bias, and R2 of the retrieval results in Tianjun region are 0.074 cm3/cm3, 0.452, and 0.682, respectively.

 Deep learning-based multimodal remote sensing image (RSI) semantic segmentation models have garnered significant attention owing to their ability to leverage complementary information across modalities, resulting in more robust and accurate Earth observation. However, most existing approaches rely predominantly on convolutional neural networks with limited receptive fields or transformer-based architectures that are computationally intensive. In this study, we proposed a multimodal cross fusion Mamba (MCF-Mamba) network for multimodal RSI semantic segmentation, aiming to collaboratively enhance accuracy and efficiency. The proposed network features three core components: a dual-branch VMamba encoder, a multimodal cross-Mamba fusion module, and a U-shaped Mamba decoder. The architecture with a unified structure centered on the selective state space model ensures that it achieves global perception with linear complexity. Furthermore, for addressing the constraint of limited labeled samples in practical applications, we developed a generative multimodal complementary masked self-supervised (CMSS) strategy. It leverages abundant unlabeled RSIs to learn generalized multimodal representations by modeling intermodal complementary consistency. Extensive experiments on three public datasets involving optical-SAR and optical-DEM modalities demonstrated that the proposed network and strategy are superior to other advanced segmentation models and self-supervised methods in land cover mapping and building extraction tasks. The MCF-Mamba network achieves the highest accuracy while significantly reducing both model size and computational cost, and further improves the accuracy and generalization through the CMSS strategy.

 Potato is the world’s most important non-cereal food crop, crucial for global food security and agricultural sustainability. Large-scale potato mapping faces persistent challenges, primarily due to scarce training samples, complex background crop compositions, and limited spectral distinctiveness compared to staple crops. To overcome the persistent limitations in ground data dependency, we propose a novel Potato Mapping Index (PMI) that leverages Sentinel-2 temporal phenology to enable scalable potato identification without field sampling. The PMI operates dynamically based on crop phenological stages, utilizing Sentinel-2 bands (B8 (NIR) and B12 (SWIR-2)) and indices (normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) and red edge normalized difference vegetation index (RENDVI)) to accentuate spectral differences between potatoes and background crops. This approach effectively isolates the unique spectral signature of potato crops, facilitating accurate and efficient mapping. Validated across multiple years and in six key potato-producing countries (Belgium, China, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United States), the PMI achieved an average overall accuracy (OA) of 92% and Kappa coefficients exceeding 0.8. These performance metrics are notably higher than those of the traditional supervised classifier, random forest (RF) model, which yielded an average OA of 90% and an average Kappa coefficient of 0.72. The resulting maps show high agreement with reference datasets, demonstrating robust spatiotemporal generalization. These findings offer a novel and valuable approach for global-scale potato mapping."

 This work explores the potential of Sentinel-2 time-series imagery to investigate the differences in vineyards associated with varying soil substrates. The investigation was carried out by selecting vineyards in the Piana Rotaliana wine growing area of the autonomous province of Trento (Italy). Consistent time-series datasets were defined by selecting vineyards trained under the same trellis system and avoiding plantation renewal between 2017 and 2023. To extract Land Surface Phenology (LSP) the best configuration between vegetation indices and fitting methods for deriving LSP features was investigated. The results indicate that Enhanced Vegetation Index 2 (EVI2) provides better stability with respect to Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). For each vineyard statistical metrics were derived like LSP, Growing Season (GS; good observation within the LSP time period) and off Season (good observation outside the LSP time period) metrics. Eight datasets were defined and a Random Forest model was employed to assess classification accuracy and evaluate its stability across the years. Findings suggest that the substrate effect can be distinguished both from off Season and Growing Season metrics. Vegetation water content indices, such as the Global Vegetation Moisture Index (GVMI), emerged as the most effective and temporally stable predictors. The off Season datasets provided generally better results with respect to GS datasets when the model of one year was tested over the remaining years. The results provide valuable insights into the potential influence of soil characteristics on grapevine response over time, by highlighting the water retention capacity of the substrate and the vineyard response."

 Reliable quantification of carbon fluxes in humid tropical regions is constrained by persistent cloud cover, heterogeneous land mosaics, and the limited resolution of existing products. To address these challenges, this study developed a Cloud-Resilient Fusion Network (CRFNet) that integrates Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter with cloud-screened Sentinel-2 NDVI using a CNN–BiLSTM–multi-head attention architecture. The framework reconstructed 10 m NDVI time series in Kuala Selangor, Malaysia (2020–2024), achieving annual R2 above 0.82 and RMSE below 0.12, thereby improving temporal continuity under heavy cloud–rainfall interference. The reconstructed NDVI was used to drive a light-use-efficiency model for net ecosystem productivity (NEP) estimation, supported by temperature-based heterotrophic respiration. Results showed a 7.4 % decline in mean annual NEP across five years, with degraded mangroves and sloping croplands emerging as hotspots of sink-to-source transitions. Landscape analysis revealed strong structure–function coupling: stable forests and mangroves were characterized by large cohesive patches with largest patch index values above 40 % and edge density below 20 m ha-1, while croplands and degraded slopes exhibited higher patch numbers, reduced patch dominance, and greater edge complexity, which increased carbon source risk.

 Understanding vertical forest structure is essential for forest management and is strongly linked to ecosystem functioning. In countries with protective forests, sustainable management is key to protecting humans and infrastructure from natural hazards. Well-structured forests usually feature multiple canopy layers, enhancing resistance and resilience to natural disturbances, reducing vulnerability to natural hazards, and improving adaptation to environmental changes. Forests with a single canopy layer often require prioritised and targeted management to increase their structural complexity. Hence, mapping forest canopy layering is crucial for effective forest management and risk mitigation.We developed a reproducible method for large-scale mapping of forest canopy layering to support sustainable forest management. Using airborne laser scanning data, we combined tree- and area-based methods to distinguish between single- and multi-layered forest areas in Switzerland. Our study encompasses four forest ecoregions, seven altitudinal vegetation belts, and a variety of topographic and climatic conditions. The resulting canopy layering map (resolution 10 x 10 m) was validated against two forest structure data sets, one from the Swiss National Forest Inventory (279 plots) and an Independent Forester Assessment (198 plots), yielding overall accuracies of 68 % and 81 %, respectively. Our study provides a robust and scalable method for mapping forest canopy layering across large mountain areas, which is transferable to other regions.

Madhavan;M. Venkat Ratnam,Deciphering aerosol impacts: Unravelling long-term AOD trends and radiative forcing across key regions,"•ARFE from SBDART-MERRA-2 links AOD trends with species-specific radiative effects. •BC drives the strongest atmospheric warming, while the SU decline reduces AOD in many regions. •Contrasting DU and SS roles reveal mixed warming-cooling signals across hotspot regions. •Aerosol-radiation interactions remain highly region- and species-dependent. 
 Assessing long-term changes in Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) together with Aerosol Radiative Forcing Efficiency (ARFE, defined as radiative forcing per unit visible AOD) provides critical insight into the evolving role of different aerosol species in regional climate forcing. In this study, we analyse two decades of AOD trends (2001–2020) across eight climatically diverse regions using a multivariate regression framework, and quantify species-specific radiative effects with the Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SBDART) model. The regions were chosen to represent contrasting trends in total AOD. Our results show that sulfate aerosols, which account for the largest share of AOD over India (∼36–45 %), are the primary driver of increasing AOD and associated atmospheric warming. Black carbon (BC), although contributing only a minor fraction to total AOD (2–10 %), emerges as the dominant warming agent across most regions, with particularly strong forcing signals over the Middle East. In contrast, sea-salt (SS) aerosols exert the largest cooling influence, most prominently over the Southern African (SAF) region, partially offsetting warming from absorbing species. Europe, despite an overall decline in AOD, exhibits a slight increase in SS that sustains a regional cooling effect. These findings demonstrate that species composition, vertical distribution, and optical properties govern ARFE more strongly than the total AOD magnitude alone. By linking AOD trends with species-resolved radiative forcing efficiency across multiple regions, this study advances the interpretability of ARFE as a climate indicator and highlights its potential to inform policy-relevant assessment of aerosol-driven warming and cooling."

 Carbon monoxide (CO) is a trace gas that affects atmospheric oxidative capacity and climate change, making accurate source apportionment crucial. Here, for the first time, we identified the isotopic signatures (δ18O) of industrial-related CO sources in Changzhi of Northern China. And total 21 ambient CO samples were collected from July 17 to July 21, 2023 with the duration of 2 h. These signatures were integrated with the Stable Isotope Analysis in R (MixSIAR) model to apportion CO sources. During the observation period, the average CO mixing ratio was 0.73 ± 0.26 ppm, which exceeded the summer average levels in both China and globally. Industrial-related sources exhibited distinct δ18O enrichment (24.5 ± 1.0 ‰ for steel industry to 29.2 ± 0.1 ‰ for heavy-duty diesel trucks). They are clearly separated from existed δ18O signatures from secondary formation and vehicle sources, thus providing essential reference data for isotopic source apportionment. The δ18O values of ambient CO varied by 3.5 ‰ overall, while diurnal fluctuations were minor (approximately 0.3 ‰), indicating relative stability on diurnal scale. Incorporating industrial-related isotopic signatures into MixSIAR, contribution of primary emissions decreased from 73.6 % to 56.0 %. These results indicate only based on existed source spectra (non-methane hydrocarbons oxidation and light-duty vehicle emissions) substantially overestimate the contribution of primary sources. These findings fill a knowledge gap concerning the isotopic signatures of industrial CO emissions and emphasize the importance of incorporating localized isotopic signatures into source apportionment. This work also provides basis for developing targeted mitigation strategies in industrial cities."

 In the hilly areas of Northeast India, extensive forest cover is cleared and burned to prepare the land for shifting cultivation. A monitoring campaign was undertaken in shifting cultivation areas of West Garo Hills District of Meghalaya in Northeast India to assess the contribution of biomass burning to particulate matter (PM) bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The study was conducted across three stages viz., pre-burning, burning, and post-burning, corresponding to the timing of the burning activities of shifting cultivation. During the burning stage of shifting cultivation, there was a substantial rise in atmospheric total PAHs levels. PM10 bound PAH averaged at 1098 ± 482 ng m−3 and PM2.5 bound PAH at 854 ± 330 ng m−3, marking an increment of 16–17 times, respectively, compared to the pre-burning stage. Subsequent rainfall events reduced total PAHs levels during the post-burning stage by 30 and 25 times, respectively for PM10 and PM2.5 bound PAHs compared to the burning stage. Diagnostic ratios of specific PAH isomers suggested biomass burning as the major contributor to PM loading in the study area. Other sources include long-range transport of vehicle emissions, soil, and dust from surface mineral. Multiple Pathway Particle Dosimetry model indicated that inhaling smoke from biomass burning in the area increased PM deposition in the alveolar region by 9–10 times compared to non-burning stage. The study highlights shifting cultivation as a significant source of PAHs in the study site along with their health risk on the exposed population."

 Diesel engines are highly efficient and proven workshorse for heavy-duty automotive applications globally. However, they face challenges in controlling particulate matter emissions. Gasoline compression ignition technology simultaneously controls engine-out particulate matter and nitrogen oxide emissions. This study employed gasoline compression ignition technology using a 70:30 % (v/v) gasoline-diesel blend (G70) as a low-reactivity test fuel and an optimised fuel injection strategy. An open electronic control unit operated the engine in gasoline compression ignition mode. Tests were performed at different engine speeds (1500–2500 rev/min) and loads (5 and 10-bar brake mean effective pressure). The engine was also operated using a stock electronic control unit in baseline conventional diesel combustion mode. Particle numbers and soot mass were measured for all test cases. Soot morphology and nano-structures were analysed using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Raman spectroscopy was used to investigate the soot particle's graphene layer. Trace metal elements and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the soot were assessed using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results concluded that gasoline compression ignition emitted a lower PM mass than the baseline diesel. Diesel soot showed larger primary particles and compact aggregates, whereas chain-like soot aggregates were seen in the G70 soot. The primary particle diameter increased with engine speed but decreased with engine load. Twenty-seven trace elements and 13 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were detected in the soot sample, accounting for ∼6.64–8.85 % (w/w) of the particulate matter mass."

 Growing epidemiological evidence has reported neurological effects of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), showing stronger effects of certain PM2.5 constituents. Among the neurologic outcomes examined so far, pediatric seizure has been rarely assessed. We conducted a time-stratified case-crossover study using pediatric seizure outpatient data from a children's hospital in Shanghai. Individual-level daily concentration of PM2.5 and its chemical components (black carbon, organic matter, nitrate, sulfate, and ammonium) were estimated with a satellite-based spatiotemporal model. A conditional logistic regression with distributed lag model (DLM) was applied to estimate the associations of PM2.5 and components with pediatric seizure risk over 14 days preceding to the onset date. Quantile-based g-computation (qgcomp) approach was used to assess the joint effect of a mixture of PM2.5 components. Analyses were further stratified by sex, age, onset with/without fever, and onset with/without epilepsy. A positive association between PM2.5 or each of the components, except organic matter, and pediatric seizure onset was observed with lag windows ranging from 0 to 7 days up to 0–14 days. In the multi-pollutant model, per interquartile range (IQR) increase in exposure to the mixture of all five PM2.5 components were associated with a odds ratio (OR) of 1.03 (95 % CI: 0.95, 2.57). Black carbon and nitrate contributed the most to the positive association, accounting for 47 % and 42 %, respectively. Subgroup analyses showed a larger effect size in children under 5 years old, males, children with concomitant seizure and fever, and children without epilepsy, respectively. Short-term (daily average) exposure to PM2.5 may be a risk factor for the onset of pediatric seizure. Black carbon and nitrate were the two most important constituents contributing to the PM2.5 effect. In addition, younger children, males, and children with seizure and fever co-occurring, and children without epilepsy appeared more susceptible."

 Airborne contamination by non-dioxin-like (NDL) and dioxin-like (DL) polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) is a prevalent and significant issue affecting industrial cities worldwide and is a potential health hazard for humans and wildlife. This study investigates the contamination and health risks of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in indoor and outdoor dust from Hefei, China. The mean concentrations of ΣNDL-PCBs were 56.27 ng/g and 7.47 ng/g for indoor and outdoor dust, respectively, while ΣDL-PCBs averaged 98.81 ng/g in indoor dust and 92.86 ng/g in outdoor dust. A probabilistic health risk assessment was conducted for different age groups. The results revealed distinct PCB distribution patterns, with PCBs primarily concentrated in finer particle sizes (26–62 μm) indoors compared to outdoors (>62 μm). The health risk assessment is based on a probabilistic human health risk assessment model developed by Monte Carlo simulation methodology for five different age groups, highlighting the acceptable noncarcinogenic health effects indicated by the hazard index (HI) values. The Monte Carlo simulation was conducted with 10,000 iterations, and the 95 % confidence interval was used to express the uncertainty of the risk estimates. Exposure parameters, such as the dust intake rate, body weight, and exposure parameter, were incorporated as probabilistic inputs based on established literature or survey data. However, concerning indoor dust, the study raises concerns regarding infants' exposure to DL-PCBs and NDL-PCBs, with a total cancer risk (TCR) probability close to 5 % and exceeding the acceptable risk level of 1.00E-6 as defined by the US EPA. DL-PCBs consistently demonstrated higher hazard index and TCR values than NDL-PCBs across all scenarios. These findings highlight health concern for infants and underscore the need for targeted strategies to mitigate PCB contamination and reduce exposure, particularly in indoor environments."

 Exposure to particulate matter (PM) is a major global health concern, yet the potential relationships between its chemical and microbial components remains poorly understood, particularly in rapidly urbanizing, understudied settings. This study presents an integrated assessment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), nitrated PAHs (NPAHs), bacteria, and fungi in both fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM10) aerosols across urban, roadside, and rural sites in sub-Saharan Africa, with a focus on Rwanda across dry and wet seasons. Microbial analysis revealed that the richness and community structure of the airborne bacterial and fungal communities varied with land-use type, linked with PAH/NPAH abundance, PM size fraction, and season. Spearman correlation coefficient confirmed that bacterial communities were more strongly associated with PAH and NPAH compounds, whereas fungal communities were shaped primarily by environmental factors. One bacterial genus, Sphingobium, exhibited evidence of selective enrichment within the PAH rich PM2.5 size fraction, highlighting the potential for direct interaction between the biological and chemical compositions in air. We provide a critical baseline for African cities where air quality data are scarce. Current air quality standards, which prioritize chemical thresholds, overlook the biological burden carried by PM."

 The health effects of combined exposure to indoor volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on lung function in adults with asthma remain unclear, and the underlying metabolic mechanisms are incompletely understood. In this panel study, 53 adult asthma patients underwent repeated home visits where indoor air samples were collected for VOC measurement, lung function was assessed, and exhaled breath condensate samples were obtained for untargeted metabolomic analysis. We used linear mixed effects models to evaluate associations between individual VOCs and lung function parameters. VOCs exhibiting significant individual effects were further analyzed using quantile g-computation and Bayesian kernel machine regression models to assess combined exposure effects and identify key contributors. Metabolic pathways were explored through mediation analysis. The linear mixed effects models identified 11 VOC components significantly and negatively associated with lung function: methacrolein, acetone, butyl acetate, toluene, ethylbenzene, styrene, trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, n-hexane, octane, and hexadecane. The quantile g-computation model revealed a significant negative joint effect of these VOCs on lung function, with ethylbenzene and methacrolein contributing most substantially. These findings were corroborated by the Bayesian kernel machine regression model, supporting the robustness of the results. Mediation analysis demonstrated that proline, glycine, putrescine, and phenylethanolamine mediated the effect of trichloroethylene on reduced percent predicted peak expiratory flow, accounting for 31.0 %–41.6 % of the total effect. In conclusion, combined exposure to indoor VOCs adversely affects lung function in adults with asthma, mediated in part by specific metabolites. These findings underscore the importance of addressing indoor air quality in asthma management strategies."

 ObjectiveAlthough the benefits of green and blue spaces on human health are widely recognized, their modifying effect on the association between particulate matter (PM) exposure and the mortality risk of myocardial infarction (MI) remains insufficiently documented.MethodsA time-stratified case-crossover design was applied to analyze PM exposure and 13,629 MI-related deaths in Anhui Province from 2019 to 2023. Conditional logistic regression combined with natural cubic splines was used to estimate exposure–response relationships. Modification effects were evaluated for green spaces within 500–5000 m buffers and for different blue spaces.ResultsFor every interquartile-range increase in PM2.5 and PM10 exposure during the lag period of 0–1 days, the odds ratios (OR) of MI mortality were 1.14 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.11, 1.18) and 1.09 (95 % CI: 1.06, 1.13). Significant effect modification was observed only for green space within the 3000 m buffer (P < 0.05), with ORs of 1.10 (95 % CI: 1.05, 1.15) and 1.18 (95 % CI: 1.14, 1.23) in the high and low green space groups. PM10-related risk was lower in the high blue space group than in the low blue space group (OR: 1.06 vs 1.13), with marginal statistical significance was detected (P = 0.063).

 Vegetation is increasingly used in urban areas to improve microclimate and reduce pollutant exposure, yet its effect on pollutant dispersion within street canyons remains complex. This study combines high-resolution wind tunnel experiments and Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) using uDALES to provide a detailed three-dimensional characterization of airflow and pollutant concentration along the canyon.Special attention is given to the consistent scaling of velocity and scalar fields, using friction velocity and canyon geometry as reference quantities, and to the role of tree drag length in aligning the aerodynamic resistance of physical and numerical vegetation. The simulations reproduce key mean-flow structures, including large-scale recirculations, but tend to underestimate turbulent kinetic energy and local scalar fluxes.By jointly analyzing high-resolution wind-tunnel experiments and LES, we (i) confirm the spanwise and longitudinal concentration patterns observed experimentally, (ii) assess their sensitivity to the modeled tree drag, (iii) provide the first detailed experimental–numerical comparison of rooftop mean and turbulent mass fluxes, showing that bulk canyon ventilation exhibits no systematic dependence on tree number or drag intensity, and (iv) identify the specific strengths and limitations of each approach.

This study updates the 2006 IPCC activity inventory methods and subsequent refinements to quantify emissions from open waste burning (OWB) in Asian countries. The emissions from OWB were estimated using updated emission factors for particulate matter 10 μm (PM10), 2.5 μm (PM2.5), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and dioxins, estimating a total release of approximately 16.51 Megatons (Mt) of CO, 1.50 Mt of PM10, 1.42 Mt of PM2.5, 0.50 Mt of NOx, and 0.20 Mt of SO2 annually. The total annual climate impact is estimated at 249 Mt CO2-equivalents (CO2e), with South Asia accounting for over 39 % of these emissions owing to high population densities and limited formal waste services. These findings highlight the urgent need to explicitly incorporate open burning in national emission inventories and waste strategies while also strengthening institutional capacity, regulatory enforcement, and community-based interventions to reduce this overlooked source of pollution and climate impact."

 Free amino acids (FAAs) in ambient PM2.5 samples were investigated at a forest site in the Qinling Mountains region of central China to explore their chemical characteristics, potential atmospheric processes, and sources across four seasons of 2021–2022. A total of 14 FAAs were quantitatively characterized using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatograph coupled with a high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometer. The mass concentrations of total FAAs varied from 6.4 to 48.5 ng m−3 (mean 23 ± 11 ng m−3) over the study periods, with higher levels in spring and summer. The compositional characteristics of total FAAs varied in different seasons. Among them, valine was mostly abundant, accounting for 39 ± 5 % of total FAAs, followed by alanine (14 ± 5 %) and glycine (14 ± 6 %). The correlations of FAAs with oxidants O3 and NO2 suggest that atmospheric oxidation capacity promoted their production, but the effects on individual ones varied. The total FAAs correlated negatively with ambient relative humidity but positively with temperature, indicating that meteorology was important factors governing the FAAs formation. Seven sources for PM2.5 and FAAs, including biomass burning, gasoline vehicles exhaust, biological emissions, coal combustion, secondary formation, dust, and agricultural activities, were resolved from positive matrix factorization analysis. Biological emissions and agricultural activities were found to be the dominant sources of FAAs in this forest atmosphere. The contributions of these sources to individual FAAs varied substantially across different seasons.

 ""Iron-fisted Smog Control '1 + 9' Action Plan"" in Shaanxi Province in 2017 promoted clean heating in rural households including ""coal-to-gas"" and ""coal-to-electricity"" conversions. This study collected PM2.5 samples in Xi'an during three periods (pre-, mid-, and post-policy implementation from 2016 to 2021) and quantified policy-driven changes in particulate toxicity and underlying influence factors through DCFH-based oxidative potential (OP) measurements. The results demonstrated significant decreases in characteristic metals from residential combustion sources (As, Pb, K) alongside increases in vehicular emission tracers (Cu, Mn) during policy implementation. A progressive decline in OP (16.28 ± 2.43, 14.41 ± 2.59, and 13.77 ± 2.62 nM H2O2 m−3 in pre-, mid-, and post-policy implementation periods) confirmed the efficacy of clean energy projects in reducing oxidative stress potential. OP showed strong positive correlations (R = 0.35–0.47, P < 0.01) with water-soluble toxic metals (Fe, Cu, Mn). The source apportionment of PM2.5 OP was conducted using a combined approach of positive matrix factorization and multilayer perceptron. The results revealed that the contribution of residential combustion sources to OP decreased from 32.1 % before the policy implementation to 25.9 % afterward, showing a significant response to the clean energy policies enacted in the Guanzhong region. Meanwhile, in the post-policy period, vehicle emissions (37.3 %) surpassed residential combustion as a major contributor to OP. This study verifies that policy interventions focusing on replacing scattered coal and biomass burning effectively reduced PM2.5 OP through decreasing toxic coal/biomass combustion components (As, Pb, K), achieving dual-control strategies targeting both mass concentration and toxicity reduction in precision air pollution management."

 India is the 3rd largest emitter of fossil fuel carbon dioxide (CO2), highlighting the critical need to understand CO2 dynamics for effective carbon management. This study investigates the CO2 variability and its dynamics over India using ground-based in situ measurements (11 sites), satellite observations and model simulations. The analyses reveal distinct diurnal and seasonal patterns, along with a consistent increasing trend with global-mean CO2 concentrations. The amplitude of seasonal cycles (SCAs) vary geographically, with deeper SCAs observed in northern India and shallower ones in the south, primarily influenced by the monsoon system and temperature-dependent vegetation dynamics. The lowest SCA is observed over the high-altitude site at Hanle in north India (7.4 ppm), followed by the coastal sites at Pondicherry (8.0 ppm) and Thumba (8.5 ppm) in south India. The deepest SCA of 26.7 ppm is observed at Mohali, with one of the peaks observed in November attributed to crop residue burning in the Indo-Gangetic Plain. We have used an Atmospheric Chemistry Transport Model (ACTM) to understand spatial and temporal variations in CO2. The model simulates the phase of the SCAs reasonably well at only a few sites, e.g., Thumba, Gadanki, and fails to capture details at most sites. Coarse horizontal resolution of ACTM (2.8o × 2.8°) limits the reproduction of observed diurnal pattern at the sites near strong fluxes. Satellite observations of total column CO2 (XCO2) anomalies (2014–2024) show negative values (indicative of sink) over India during post-monsoon season, and positive values (indicative of source) during premonsoon season. The regional mean XCO2 SCA (5.45–5.65 ppm), trend (2.44–2.51 ppm y−1) and interannual variability in growth rates (∼1.0–3.9 ppm y−1) are consistently estimated from two satellites during 2009–2024."

 High-latitude regions are particularly susceptible to the impacts of climate change and global warming. Organic aerosols are widespread and play a vital role in the Earth's climate; therefore, monitoring their molecular distributions, sources, and formation processes is essential. The present study investigates water-soluble dicarboxylic acids and related secondary organic compounds in aerosols from the Gruvebadet observatory in Ny-Ålesund during summer 2023 to gain insights into the formation processes of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) in the Arctic atmosphere. The results indicate that oxalic acid (C2) was the most abundant, followed by succinic (C4) and phthalic (Ph) acids, as well as malonic (C3) and azelaic (C9) acids. The higher abundance of C4 over C3 (on average) suggests relatively fresh emission sources. The high fumaric-to-maleic (F/M) ratios (mean: 1.14 ± 0.46) and diacids-C/TC ratios (16.4 ± 6.67 %) indicate that photochemical processes were a significant source of diacids throughout the sampling period. The mass diagnostic ratios indicate that the photochemical oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) enriched in the sea-surface micro-layer is the primary source of SOA, followed by the oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons (AHCs). Furthermore, quantification of C2 associated with the photooxidation of UFAs was conducted using a linear relationship-based approach. The results show that on average, 61 ± 20 % (range: 9–83 %) of C2 was derived from the oxidation of UFAs, with the rest was attributed to the photooxidation of AHCs. The present study also highlighted potential uncertainties in using regression-based source apportionment of C2 with bootstrap analysis. These findings will improve our understanding of the transformation processes of organic aerosols, which are vital for climate modellers to accurately estimate SOA mass and its climatic effects, especially in the Arctic environment."

 Urban air pollution requires analytical tools that capture complex temporal dynamics while remaining interpretable for policy purposes. This study applies Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA) to hourly concentrations of NO2, PM10, and PM2.5 measured in 2024 at eight monitoring stations in Madrid. By transforming high-dimensional time series into smooth functional data, FPCA identifies dominant modes of variability and reveals structural differences among sites.Across all pollutants, the first three components explained more than 85% of total variance. PC1 represented the main seasonal cycle, PC2 reflected short-term fluctuations driven by traffic and meteorology, and PC3 captured episodic peaks. The score plots highlighted consistent clustering: background stations (Casa de Campo, Sanchinarro) showed low levels and weak seasonality; traffic-oriented stations (Plaza Elíptica, Cuatro Caminos, Escuelas Aguirre) displayed high concentrations and stronger cycles; and intermediate sites (Castellana, Plaza Castilla, Méndez Álvaro) exhibited mixed patterns.These findings confirm FPCA as an efficient diagnostic framework for air quality assessment, offering both dimensionality reduction and interpretability. Beyond methodological value, the approach enables classification of monitoring sites and supports targeted mitigation strategies. FPCA thus provides a transferable tool for urban air quality management and a solid basis for functional data analysis in environmental policy contexts."

 Subway systems provide an important mode of sustainable urban public transportation reducing traffic congestion and vehicle emissions. However, there are increasing concerns over the elevated levels of particulate matter (PM) concentrations found in the subway and the potential health effects from train-related emissions. These emission sources are common worldwide with the highest concentrations driven by lack of ventilation, tunnel depth and distance from tunnel openings. The aim of this study was to assess PM2.5 mass concentrations, particle number concentrations and particle number size distributions by taking measurements inside a train carriage in a London Underground deep-tunnelled line. A fully portable, battery powered Mobile Reference Station (MoRS) was developed to obtain simultaneous measurements of oxides of nitrogen, ozone and all size fractions of PM in train carriages across 16 distinct Bakerloo Line subway journeys. In the tunnelled sections of the Bakerloo line mean PM2.5 concentrations were 343 (115) μg m−3, with mean concentrations peaking at 550 (45) μg m−3 at Marylebone Station. A moderate negative correlation between PM2.5 and NO2 was demonstrated likely influenced by a complex relationship linking tunnel depth, ventilation, ambient air, PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations. PM2.5 concentrations and particle size distributions were seen to be driven by the piston effect of moving trains and settling processes. Using particle number size distributions, ultrafine particles were found to constitute 84 % of subway particle number concentrations with 99 % of subway particles having a diameter less than 530 nm. Lung Deposited Surface Area (LDSA) was used to estimate PM exposure during the subway journeys. Importantly, total LDSA for PM2.5 was higher in the subway than at a London roadside site. Overall, this study provides a basis to begin to control specific train related emission sources and to improve air quality management through focused mitigation strategies in the London Underground and worldwide subway systems."

 Accurate methane concentration measurements are essential for trace gas flux studies in agricultural and environmental research, such as estimating emissions from rice paddies. We developed a novel direct calibration method with high pressure cylinders for determination of methane in atmospheric pressure portable bags using gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. This advanced approach eliminates the time-consuming and error-prone indirect calibration process frequently used in real practice. We modeled gas behavior in the sample loop, ensuring consistent pressure across container types. Four sampling configurations were tested, with Configuration 1 achieving negligible biases (−0.083 to −0.310 μmol mol−1) across methane concentrations of 27.9–48.6 μmol mol−1 in N2 or synthetic air, compared to significant biases (−4.1 % to −11.4 %) in Configurations 2–4 due to improper gas flow. A strong linear cause-and-effect relationship (R2 = 0.9953) was established between gas pressure bias in the SL and methane concentration bias. The single-point-through-origin calibration model, supported by a detailed uncertainty estimation, showed a maximum relative bias of −0.83 % for Configuration 1, statistically insignificant at the 95 % confidence level (expanded uncertainty 1.1 %, 0.31 μmol mol−1). The equivalence decision criterion (D ≤ 1.0) confirmed that methane concentrations in Tedlar bags were statistically indistinguishable from calibration cylinders. This analytical approach enhances the practical benefits of portable bags, including their lightweight design and ease of handling, for reliable sample storage and transport. The findings provide theoretical insights and practical guidance for reliable methane quantification, applicable to greenhouse gas analysis across various sectors, improving the accuracy of trace gas flux measurements."

 This study examines tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) vertical column densities (VCDs) over Thailand using ground-based Pandora observations in Bangkok and S5P/TROPOMI satellite data at the national scale. Pandora measurements reveal distinct diurnal and weekly cycles, with sharp rush-hour peaks and lower weekend values, reflecting strong anthropogenic influence. Monthly and seasonal analyses show that NO2 is highest in winter and lowest during the monsoon, influenced by the height of the boundary layer, precipitation, and photolysis rates. A comparison of Pandora and S5P/TROPOMI monthly averages shows strong temporal agreement while revealing a consistent low bias in S5P/TROPOMI. A seasonal breakdown shows the highest agreement in summer, moderate agreement in winter, and the poorest performance during the rainy season. At the national scale, the highest NO2 levels are concentrated in central Thailand, especially Bangkok (5.59 × 1015 molec/cm2). Elevated column amounts also appear across the Bangkok Metropolitan Region and the Eastern Economic Corridor, consistent with urban–industrial sources, while Lampang exhibits a distinct hotspot associated with emissions from the Mae Moh power plant. The seasonal variation of aerosol optical depth (AOD) also follows the NO2 pattern, with high AOD corresponding to elevated NO2 levels during winter in central Thailand and during summer in northern Thailand. In contrast, both AOD and NO2 decrease substantially during the rainy season due to enhanced wet deposition and more efficient atmospheric cleansing. These results highlight the dominant influence of traffic, industry, and power generation on Thailand's NO2 burden."

 Accurate, high-frequency monitoring of aerosols is essential for understanding their dynamic behaviour, regional transport pathways, environmental and climatic impacts. Geostationary satellites are particularly well-suited for this purpose. In this study, we utilized INSAT-3DR satellite observations to retrieve high-quality sub-hourly aerosol optical depth (AOD) using a data-driven approach guided by a physically meaningful and interpretable machine learning framework. For this, we constructed a novel fused AOD product by integrating ground-based and satellite-based observations through hybrid statistical approach. The fused AOD showed a strong correlation coefficient (r ∼ 0.95) and low root mean square error (RMSE ∼ 0.06) with ground-based observations. Making use of this fused AOD as the target variable, an XGBoost machine learning model is trained with features derived from INSAT-3DR visible and infrared channels. The resulting model demonstrates strong performance in retrieving AOD from INSAT-3DR (r ∼ 0.839 and RMSE ∼ 0.081; relative to fused AOD), effectively capturing the regional distribution of aerosol hotspots, sub-hourly variability, and key pollution events, indicating robust generalization across diverse aerosol regimes and surface types. Furthermore, INSAT-3DR AOD exhibits strong temporal consistency with the ground-based observations at sub-hourly and seasonal scales with site-specific RMSE generally within 0.10. These findings establish INSAT-3DR as a valuable platform for continuous aerosol monitoring and present a transferable framework for future geostationary missions aimed at environmental and climate applications."

 The Sichuan Basin is one of China's most haze-prone regions due to its unique topography and stagnant meteorological conditions. To understand the winter haze formation mechanisms in the Sichuan Basin, a field campaign was conducted in a previously identified pollution hotspot (Southern Sichuan, December 2024 to February 2025). During this campaign, PM2.5 concentration averaged 63.79 ± 42.92 μg m−3, and we identified three haze episodes (H1-H3) during this campaign. The chemical speciation of fine aerosol was characterized using a quadrupole aerosol chemical speciation monitor (Q-ACSM), and the apportionment of organic aerosols (OAs) was solved by EPA PMF 5.0. The results indicated that OAs dominated the PM2.5 composition throughout this campaign, with OA concentrations particularly high in H1 (64.63 ± 20.77 μg m−3) and H2 (64.11 ± 19.05 μg m−3). Biomass burning organic aerosols (BBOA) and oxygenated organic aerosols (OOA) were the primary contributors to these high concentrations. The haze episodes resulted mainly from early-stage biomass burning emissions and less-aged OOA, occurring concurrently with the highest levels of aerosol liquid water content (ALWC), suggesting the humid air can favor the formation of haze. In addition to local emissions, regional transport synergized with meteorological conditions also significantly contributed to haze formation during this campaign, especially in H2 (38.2 %), quantified by a machine learning based deweathering analysis. This study underscores the intricate interplay between emissions, regional transport, and meteorology in driving haze formation in the Sichuan Basin and demonstrates the utility of machine learning aided diagnostics for source attribution and regulatory insights."

 Organic peroxyl radicals (RO2·) serve as crucial intermediates in atmospheric volatile organic compounds (VOCs) degradation process, playing a pivotal role in the formation of secondary air pollution in the atmosphere. Among naturally generated RO2 radical species, the Isoprene peroxyl radical derived from the oxidation of isoprene produced by plants, exhibits a relatively high concentration. It can drive the formation of photochemical ozone (O3), facilitate the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) and organic nitrates, and is of critical importance in modulating the atmospheric oxidation capacity. Consequently, the accurate detection of the chemical behavior of isoprene peroxyl radical is of great significance for simulating and predicting regional air quality and evaluating the impact of nitrogen deposition on ecosystems. In this study, we for the first time report a furan - based fluorescent probe (IND-F). Through a specific capture reaction, this probe enables the in-situ quantitative detection of isoprene peroxyl radicals (ISOP34O2) in the atmosphere for the first time. This method features high sensitivity and offers a novel tool for the direct and convenient monitoring of specific radical species in the atmospheric environment."

 Uncontrolled urbanization has deep-rooted impacts on the environment, including weather, climate, and pollution, threatening the sustainability of cities. The current study focuses on six cities of the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), which act as hotspots of air pollution across the country. Machine learning (ML) algorithms were utilized to analyze and forecast four major air pollutants, viz., NO2, SO2, O3, and PM2.5. The model performances based on RMSE, MAE, and R2 values suggested that Linear Regression (LR) outperformed other models considered, and was more accurate in short-term prediction. In most of the considered cities, the overall trends (Mann-Kendall test) of four selected air pollutants are expected to remain unaltered in coming years, except for Delhi and Ludhiana. The PM2.5 concentrations exhibit a strong increasing trend both during the observed and forecasted period, except for Chandigarh-Mohali. Notably, Kolkata exhibited an increasing trend for all four air pollutants while demonstrating higher values of PM2.5 (200–450 μg/m3), which were greatly impacted by the pollution from nearby land and transport pathways over neighboring oceans. The analysis and forecasting (using ConvLSTM model) of urban land use was done to further associate urbanization with air pollution. Strong correlation signatures were noticed in all cities, either at the core or near the periphery (except for Chandigarh-Mohali), when the interplay was assessed through urban heat and pollution islands. Therefore, with prolonged exposure to air pollutants, the urban population is at higher risk of several pulmonary ailments, as the estimated mortality associated with PM2.5 for cardiovascular, respiratory, and lung infections indicated a constant increase over the years."

 Influenza is a serious respiratory infection that imposes significant public health challenges. However, the precise impact of pollutants on influenza virus activity remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of different air pollutants on the incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI), influenza A (Flu A), and influenza B (Flu B) in China based on nationwide air pollution and influenza data from 554 sentinel hospitals across 30 provinces and municipalities from 2014 to 2017. A Distributed Lag Nonlinear Model (DLNM) was employed to discern the lagged effects of six distinct air pollutants, namely PM2.5, PM10, O3, CO, SO2, and NO2, on the incidence of ILI, Flu A, and Flu B. Our analysis indicated that the relationship between air pollutants and influenza varied among ILI, Flu A, and Flu B, with Flu B being more sensitive to SO2 than Flu A. Elevated levels of air pollutants were generally associated with an increased risk of influenza; however, relative risks declined slightly at extreme concentrations of PM2.5, SO2, and NO2.

 Hydroxymethanesulfonate (HMS) is a key secondary organosulfur compound formed through aqueous-phase or heterogeneous atmospheric processes, significantly affecting the atmospheric sulfur budget. However, the relationship between HMS and PM2.5 components, as well as its formation mechanism, remains insufficiently explored. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of HMS at two sites in the North China Plain (NCP). Using offline filter analysis combined with theoretical calculations, we found that the HMS mass concentration in Gucheng during the winter of 2019 averaged 2.58 ± 2.56 μg/m3, approximately 1.5 times of that in Beijing during winter and 5.0 times of that in Beijing during autumn. This elevated concentration in Gucheng is attributed to higher relative humidity, elevated particle pH, and higher precursor concentrations. Correlation analyses demonstrated that aerosol liquid water content (AWC) is a key factor influencing HMS formation, while ammonium and nitrate may also contribute significantly. Theoretical calculations suggest that HMS formation primarily occurs through the reaction between SO32− and HCHO, with an additional contribution from the reaction of HSO3− with HCHO. Aqueous H2O and NH3 can act as catalysts, reducing the reaction barrier between HSO3− and HCHO from 9.76 kcal/mol (uncatalyzed) to 5.01 and 6.48 kcal/mol, respectively, thus promoting HMS formation. Increasing concentrations of aqueous H3O+ and NH4+ during polluted periods do not exhibit a catalytic effect but instead strongly inhibit HMS formation. These results indicate that a comprehensive consideration of the combined effects of various aqueous species is essential in atmospheric models."

 This study evaluates the sensitivity of the GEOS-Chem atmospheric transport model to three CO2 surface flux databases—GOSAT-IM, NASA-GEOS, and NOAA CarbonTracker (NOAA-CT)—in simulating the tropospheric CO2 seasonal cycle during 2010–2014. Model outputs, generated using common anthropogenic emissions and meteorological forcing, were compared against NOAA-ESRL GLOBALVIEW in situ observations from 54 stations worldwide. All simulations coherently reproduced the observed latitudinal gradient, with high CO2 concentrations (greater than 395 ppm) in the northern sub-polar region driven by fossil fuel emissions and shallow winter boundary layers, and lower concentrations (below 390 ppm) over the southern oceans due to strong uptake and vertical mixing. Among the simulations, the one using NOAA-CT input data showed the highest correlation (greater than 0.95) with observations in the northern mid-latitudes. This high correlation is attributed to the fluxes being constrained by actual observations. The simulation with GOSAT also captured the seasonal amplitudes in the northern hemisphere, although with lesser agreement, while the simulation with NASA-GEOS underestimated observed amplitudes in the tropics. Regional discrepancies, especially in the tropical and southern hemispheric regions, highlight the influence of convective processes and uncertainties in the flux datasets. Horizontal advection dominated seasonal variability at polar stations, whereas vertical transport was more important in the tropics. These findings emphasize the need for improved time-varying flux products, better parameterizations for vertical mixing, and the integration of new satellite observations to reduce model biases. This study highlights the crucial role of surface flux datasets, particularly the spatiotemporal resolution and observational constraints embedded in them in simulating the global CO2 seasonal cycle. Among the evaluated datasets, NOAA-CT most accurately captured the phase, amplitude, and transport-driven dynamics of atmospheric CO2, reinforcing its utility in model-data for carbon cycle assessments."

 The global phase-out of leaded gasoline marked a major milestone in pollution control, yet modern uses of lead (Pb) continue to pose significant health risks, especially in low- and middle-income countries. In the Philippines, significant data gaps still exist despite increasing exposure. This study presents to the best of our knowledge, the first Pb isotopic fingerprinting of atmospheric aerosols in Metro Manila, Philippines, covering fine (0.56–1 μm) and coarse (5.6–10 μm) fractions, collected in 2018–2019. Results show that local sources, mainly industrial activities (45–62 %) and fossil fuel combustion (30–45 %), are now the dominant contributors to airborne Pb, while a minor legacy leaded gasoline and geogenic Pb persists (<18 %) through soil resuspension. Stable isotopes show no clear seasonal pattern. Together with 25 fold higher Pb concentration in the fine fraction, these indicate limited transboundary input. Regional comparison highlights overlapping Pb isotopic composition across Southeast Asia, but is distinct from areas farther north due to intensive coal use in China. The consistency between isotopic fingerprinting and Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) results demonstrates the value of combining methods for robust source apportionment. These findings demonstrate the continuing importance of isotopic monitoring for distinguishing contemporary and legacy Pb sources and informing targeted air quality management in rapidly developing regions."

 Delhi experiences severe air quality deterioration during the post-monsoon and winter seasons, driven by anthropogenic emissions and natural meteorological factors. This study investigates the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) characteristics during heavy air pollution and fog conditions over Delhi from October 2023 to February 2024 using ground-based Lidar, satellite, and reanalysis data. Lidar measurements reveal a persistently shallow ABL (<1 km) from November to January, with nighttime boundary layer height (BLH) suppressed by strong radiative inversions. Elevated PM2.5 concentrations during this period show an inverse, power-law relationship with BLH. The ventilation coefficient (VC) remained below 800 m2s-1 from November to January, indicating poor dispersion. INSAT-3D/3DR satellite data showed a peak fog occurrence of 75 % over Delhi, with the highest frequency in January. Analysis showed that the combined frequency of haze, fog, and low-level clouds reached 22.46 % during the study period, with the highest occurrences in November (45.10 %) and January (39.55 %). Ground-based Lidar observations captured fine-scale features such as shallow inversion layers, nighttime ABL collapse, and diurnal boundary layer development more accurately than reanalysis. These insights are crucial for enhancing urban weather models, air quality forecasts, and early warning systems in pollution-affected regions."

 Open Crop Straw Burning (OCSB) exerts significant impacts on air quality and the radiation balance through the concentrated short-term release of particulate matter and trace gases. However, previous studies have primarily focused on air quality impacts, with limited attention to the radiative effects (RE) induced by OCSB. This study integrates satellite observations with multi-year (2016–2020) simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) to investigate the effects of burning events before spring plowing in Northeast China (NEC), a region representative of OCSB activity. We quantify the spatiotemporal patterns of OCSB emissions and evaluate their contributions to surface PM2.5 concentrations and radiative effects. Satellite data reveal a 54 % reduction in fire counts across NEC from 2016 to 2020, reflecting the effectiveness of straw-burning ban policies. This decline led to notable reductions in PM2.5 pollution. WRF-Chem simulations show that OCSB emissions contributed 28.74 μg/m3 to surface PM2.5 in 2016, decreasing to 6.78 μg/m3 in 2020. Correspondingly, the surface shortwave RE declined from −21.36 W/m2 in 2016 to −13.97 W/m2 in 2020, while atmospheric RE decreased from 16.47 W/m2 to 8.85 W/m2. For the first time, we present a multi-year, observation-constrained evaluation of atmospheric quality and radiative effects before the spring plowing season in NEC, filling the gap in the regional OCSB radiation assessment and informing the development of emission control policies."

 Ammonia (NH3) emissions significantly impact air quality and the Earth's radiation balance through their interactions with other atmospheric chemical species to form particulate matter. Reducing NH3 emissions from croplands without compromising productivity is challenging due to the widespread and diffuse nature of NH3 sources. In the absence of direct monitoring networks, emission inventories provide the crucial basis for designing and implementing emission control measures. In South Asia (SA), knowledge of NH3 emissions at the regional scale is limited by the coarse-resolution global emission inventories, which carry significant uncertainties due to generalized emission factors. Here, we estimated remote sensing-based NH3 emissions from SA croplands at a 250-m spatial resolution between 2003 and 2020 by incorporating local knowledge of farming practices. Our estimates reveal that an average of 5.7 Tg NH3 is emitted annually from SA croplands. We found a ∼25 % increase in total NH3 emissions over the period, attributable to cropland expansion and a shift toward more fertilizer-demanding crop cultivation. A comparison of the modeled annual NH3 fluxes with global emission inventories reveals discrepancies in the range of −10 to +30 %. The comparison of total column NH3 concentrations retrieved from satellite observations and simulated by chemical transport model simulations using our fine-scale NH3 emission inventory shows a high correlation coefficient (r ≥ 0.47) but indicates an average bias of −21 %. We estimated that without adopting any mitigation strategies to reduce NH3 emissions, future climate change under specific Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP2-RCP4.5) will exacerbate environmental pollution by increasing NH3 volatilization by 6 % in the 2050s. However, mitigation strategies, such as incorporating fertilizers into the soil at the time of crop sowing, could decrease NH3 emissions by 18 % even under future climate conditions, relative to current levels. Our work highlights the importance of strategic agricultural management to make the SA food systems more sustainable and resilient to climate change."

 Kathmandu Valley is one of the most densely populated cities in Nepal, facing significant air quality challenges. This study presents a comprehensive analysis based on twelve months of continuous air quality measurement data collected at the Khumaltar Air Quality Monitoring Station (ICIMOD AQMS), which is located in the southern part of the Kathmandu Valley. The study investigates particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5, PMC (PM10–PM2.5)) alongside trace gases (O3, NOX, SO2, and CO), focuses on their seasonal, diurnal variations, interspecies correlations, potential sources, and the impact of regional atmospheric transport. The results reveal that the annual PM2.5 concentration (49 μgm−3) largely exceeds the WHO air quality guideline of 5 μgm−3. Pollutant concentrations show clear seasonal variation, with peaks during the winter and pre-monsoon seasons, and a noticeable decline during the monsoon. A strong correlation (r = 0.82, p = 0.00) between PM2.5 and NOX indicates that fossil fuel combustion is a dominant source of fine particulate pollution. During the pre-monsoon season, O3 concentrations occasionally exceed 100 ppb (8-hr running average), with seasonal diurnal concentration observed close to 90 ppb in the afternoon. The study found that temperature and relative humidity significantly influence coarse PM levels, with a strong negative correlation (r = −0.89, p = 0.00) between coarse PM and the relative humidity, suggesting less resuspension under moist conditions. Furthermore, this study highlights the severe air pollution in the Kathmandu Valley throughout the year, driven primarily by local emissions, with regional atmospheric transport further contributing to poor air quality."

 Ultrafine particles (UFP, less than 100 nm in aerodynamic diameter) pose significant health and environmental risks. These particles can originate from anthropogenic sources such as traffic emissions and fuel combustion, or form through atmospheric reactions. To reduce human exposure to UFP, it is important to understand the processes that can increase UFP concentrations. Current methods typically use particle size data to identify processes such as nucleation events. Recent studies have applied machine learning, particularly the transfer learning method, to this task. However, particle size distribution data is not widely available at many monitoring sites. In this study, we aimed to identify UFP sources using machine learning classification models only based on high time-resolution total number concentration data, rather than size distribution data, making the approach applicable to locations where only total UFP measurements are available. We have previously analyzed particle size data ranging from 6 to 520 nm collected from 2006 to the end of 2021 at the Southern Ontario Centre for Atmospheric Aerosol Research (SOCAAR) near a busy roadway in downtown Toronto, Canada. The days were classified into five categories: Strong Nucleation, Midday Pollution, Traffic Pollution, Baseline, and Mixed. Two machine learning approaches were tried: (1) ensemble learning models, and (2) transfer learning models. Both approaches performed well, achieving average accuracies of 80% and 75%, respectively. While transfer learning models were more robust to missing values, the ensemble learning method was slightly more robust to moderate noise and was also less computationally demanding. The ensemble learning models were then applied to a second monitoring location with a lower UFP level. The predicted classes at this site had similar characteristics to the classified days at the first site, with 78%, 58%, and 50% of the Strong Nucleation, Baseline, and Traffic Pollution days identified at both sites being classified into the same respective categories. These results suggest that the ensemble learning models could be transferred to other locations."

 This study integrates in-situ and satellite observations to characterize urban greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across Houston, Texas USA. Surface-based background concentrations show seasonal reductions from ∼435 to ∼410 ppm for carbon dioxide (CO2) due to photosynthetic uptake, and from ∼2.02 to ∼1.88 ppm for methane (CH4) predominantly due to oxidation by the hydroxyl radical (OH). Boundary layer height corrected excess CO2 and CH4 (ΔCO2, ΔCH4) peak in winter (∼139.4 ppm, ∼5.5 ppm) and drop in summer (∼5.6 ppm, ∼0.08 ppm), highlighting emission seasonality. The observed annual ΔCH4/ΔCO2 ratio (9.4 ppb ppm−1) exceeds EDGAR and EPA inventory estimates by 65–70 %, and spatial mapping identifies key CH4 hotspots - such as McCarty and Blue Ridge landfills - with ratios larger than 40–70 ppb ppm−1, which are severely underrepresented in emission inventories.Satellite-derived enhancements from OCO-3 and TROPOMI offer broader coverage but lack sensitivity to surface plumes. For example, in situ bivariate plots show sharp ΔCO2 enhancements >30 ppm and ΔCH4 up to ∼0.3 ppm over industrial zones like the Ship Channel, while satellite ΔXCO2 (∼5–7 ppm) and ΔXCH4 (∼0.03–0.04 ppm) show moderate enhancements over the urban core. TROPOMI NO2 (∼1 × 10−4 μmol/m2) and HCHO (∼2.0 × 10−4 mol/m2) enhancements further confirm co-located industrial emissions. This synthesis underscores the value of combining surface and satellite data for robust urban emission assessments and improved emission inventory evaluation."

 Carbonaceous aerosols (CA) strongly impact regional and global climate through their light-absorbing and scattering properties, yet their effects remain uncertain in dust-influenced regions. We investigated the optical properties, source contributions, and radiative impacts of CA at two climatically distinct regions in northwestern India: an arid region (AR, Jodhpur; post-monsoon) and a semi-arid region (SAR, Kota; winter). Mean absorption Ångström exponent (AAE) values were comparable between the two regions (AR: 1.416 ± 0.173; SAR: 1.395 ± 0.069), but temporal cluster analysis revealed source-specific variability, with lower AAE during traffic-dominated periods (∼1.30) and elevated AAE during solid fuel and biomass combustion (1.68 in AR and 1.52 in SAR). While equivalent BC (eBC) levels were higher in AR with a relatively uniform liquid-fuel contribution (BClf = 80.06 ± 1.98 %), the mass absorption cross-section of BC (MACBC) in SAR was ∼4.5X greater, driven by local solid fuel combustion and transported biomass burning emissions (BCsf = 34.61 ± 6.88 %). Mie modelling indicated higher SSA in AR due to higher contribution of mineral dust, in contrast to SAR, where carbonaceous aerosols caused stronger absorption, forward scattering, and higher imaginary refractive index (kOBD). Although absorption enhancement (Eλ) was slightly higher in AR (∼1.11 vs. ∼0.99), SAR aerosols nearly doubled the warming potential (ΔRFE), with RFE values of ∼0.87 W/m2 in SAR versus ∼0.43 W/m2 in AR. These findings highlight strong source-specific and site-specific variability in aerosol absorption and radiative, emphasizing the need to integrate region-specific parameters into climate models and air quality assessments for data-scarce arid and semi-arid South Asian environments."

 In this study, an emission inventory of 16 PAHs, including 7 carcinogenic PAHs, was developed using the latest data for Korea. The study incorporated emission sources that had been omitted in previous studies. PAHs emissions were estimated by region (at city, county, and district levels) and sector to enable a more precise identification of the emission status in Korea. The total annual emission of 16 PAHs in Korea in 2017 was 1259.7 Mg, with 7 PAHs contributing 41.77 Mg. The major sector of the emissions of the 16 PAHs was industrial process (33.5 %). For the 7 PAHs, other area source was the major emission sector (38.8 %), mainly due to wildfires. In terms of regional aspects, regions with high Industrial Process activities such as ULSAN, JEONNAM, CHUNGNAM, along with GYEONGGI, a major hub for Korean Energy Transport and Storage, showed the highest emissions. The developed emission inventory was intercompared with other inventories, ensuring the appropriate application of emission factors for each emission sector. Especially, it was found that the Korean PAH emissions reported in EDGARv6.0 were 1.9–5.1 times different from those estimated in this study, depending on the pollutant. It was discovered that the emission factors in the residential sector in EDGARv6.0 may differ from the actual emission characteristics in Korea. The PAHs emission inventory developed in this study is anticipated to be used for the establishment and regulation of PAHs policies in Korea. Furthermore, the research results are expected to be essential reference material for refining the emission inventory of PAHs for Korea, which is used in atmospheric transport modeling."

 The individual and joint effects of short-term exposure to heat waves and ozone (O3) on mortality, particularly on nervous system disease mortality, need further investigation, as global warming leads to frequent heat waves and increased O3 concentrations. Heat waves were identified when the daily maximum apparent temperature reached or exceeded the temperature threshold (the 90th percentile of the temperature in 2019–2023) for at least 2, 3, or 4 consecutive days. High-level O3 was defined as daily maximum 8-h average O3 concentrations above 100 μg/m3. Based on 51,073 death cases from the Shenzhen Mortality Surveillance System in 2019–2023, we found significant individual and joint effects of short-term exposure to heat waves and high-level O3 on mortality, including all-cause non-accidental mortality, circulatory disease mortality, and nervous system disease mortality, employing a case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression models. Excess fractions of all-cause non-accidental deaths, circulatory disease deaths, and nervous system disease deaths attributable to heatwave and high levels of O3 exposure could be as high as 6.42 %, 8.28 %, and 13.21 %.

 This study investigated long-term anthropogenic contributions to airborne particulate matter (PM10) in the Upper Meža Valley, Slovenia, a region historically affected by ore mining, smelting, and, more recently, secondary Pb production. PM10 samples collected at five locations in the summer and autumn of 2018 and at one location in the spring and summer of 2021 were analysed for elemental composition and Pb isotope ratios to identify and quantify pollution sources. Elevated concentrations of Pb, Zn, Cd, and As were observed across all sites, with minimal temporal variations. Enrichment factor (EF) analysis indicated lower EF values for Zn and As, suggesting a primarily crustal origin. Conversely, higher EF values for Cd and Pb pointed to mixed crustal and anthropogenic sources. The proportion of PM10 samples with high Pb enrichment increased from 9.09 % in 2018 to 20.5 % in 2021, indicating a rising influence of anthropogenic emissions. This study represents the first application of Pb isotope composition and a two-endmember mixing model for detailed source apportionment of PM10 in the region. The Pb isotope ratios of PM10 samples fell between local geogenic background and known anthropogenic sources, with anthropogenic contributions accounting for 55.8 %–69.3 % of total Pb in PM10. These findings have important implications for local environmental management, as they can support targeted mitigation strategies, which are critical for public health protection."

 SM2RAIN-ASCAT, a bottom-up satellite-based precipitation product, has been increasingly used for drought monitoring due to its ability to estimate rainfall from soil moisture data. To determine its suitability for precipitation estimation and drought monitoring in Morocco, this study compares SM2RAIN-ASCAT dataset with observed data from 36 ground-based stations. This analysis examines the performance of the satellite product in a variety of climate zones across the country. The accuracy of the precipitation dataset was assessed using a suite of quantitative and qualitative metrics validated against observations. For the purpose of drought monitoring, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was calculated at 1, 3, 6, and 12 month timescales. To evaluate the performance of the product, the evaluation was also stratified by climate zone. The mean correlation coefficient (CC) with ground observations strengthened from 0.45 (daily) to 0.67 (monthly), with monthly and 10 days aggregations providing the most consistent performance. The dataset had a high probability of detecting rain events, with a monthly Probability of Detection (POD) exceeding 0.75 for 89% of stations. While the product showed a tendency to underestimate intense rainfall, the relative bias was low at nearly half of the stations, and the lowest RMSE value was found at monthly scale. With an underestimation of precipitation in Mediterranean regions and an overestimation in arid regions of Morocco, the product exhibits climatic bias; yet, its efficacy for drought monitoring has been proven. The calculated SPI values for short to medium-term durations (1, 3, 6 and 12 months) align well with ground observations across several climate zones in Morocco. While the 1 month SPI shows only weak to moderate agreement with gauge data, the correlation strengthens markedly for 3 and 6 month periods, with a CC of approximately 0.70 and 0.80, respectively. Notably, the results for long-term hydrological drought monitoring (SPI-12) are particularly promising, demonstrating excellent agreement with ground observations across nearly all stations. SM2RAIN-ASCAT is a reliable option for drought analysis in many arid regions like Morocco, it excels at detecting droughts in arid zones over humid ones, and similarly, it performs highly at identifying wet periods in hot arid climates than in wetter zones. Finding show that the integration of bottom-up (SM2RAIN) and top-down approaches can improve precipitation and drought monitoring performance, compensating for the limitations of each method. Overall SM2RAIN-ASCAT product is particularly recommended for agricultural drought monitoring and water management."

 Severe wintertime PM2.5 pollution persists in the Urumqi–Changji–Shihezi urban agglomeration, China's largest arid-region urban cluster, despite emission controls that have improved air quality in eastern China. Using air quality monitoring data, radiosonde observations, and chemical transport model simulations for two winters (2022–2024), we investigated the combined roles of synoptic-scale circulation and basin terrain in modulating pollutant accumulation. Results show that PM2.5 pollution exhibits strong spatial synchrony among Urumqi, Changji, and Shihezi, indicating dominant regional meteorological control beyond local emissions. Stagnant westerly circulation with warm advections aloft fosters persistent cold-air pool within the Junggar Basin, producing strong thermal inversions, shallow boundary layers, and PM2.5 accumulation in the urban agglomeration. In contrast, Siberian cold surges and northwesterly flows channel cold air through low-elevation gaps on the basin's north and west margins, weakening stratification, enhancing surface winds via horizontal and partial downward momentum transport, and deepening the boundary layer, which promotes pollutant dispersion.

 Tropospheric ozone (O3) pollution is an emerging challenge in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, where extreme meteorology and multiple pollution gradients frequently occurred. However, altitude-dependent structure of O3 transport under such conditions has been rarely quantified. Here, we resolved horizontal and vertical O3 fluxes in Beijing, Tianjin and Shijiazhuang across favorable/unfavorable meteorology, heatwaves, and varying pollution gradients through WRF-CAMx models. Results revealed strong spatial autocorrelation for O3 across “2 + 36” Chinese cities (Moran's I: 0.21–0.77), with pronounced clustering in autumn and winter. Dominant southwest-northeast corridors were identified, with episodic cross-sea inflows to Tianjin, contributing 12.1 %–21.5 % of total inflow. Horizontal inflow and outflow fluxes peaked on pollution days (e.g., exceeding 44 kt/d in Beijing) and bottomed on excellent days (e.g., 28.8 kt/d in Beijing), while net fluxes showed the opposite trend, ranging from 0.4 to 5.3 kt/d. Vertically, upward fluxes maximized during pollution days, with Beijing transitioning from a net “sink” (−24.0 to −55.7 kt/d in non-pollution scenarios) to a “source” (46.7–85.5 kt/d on pollution days), whereas Tianjin and Shijiazhuang consistently acted as a “source”. Furthermore, the vertical distribution of the horizontal and vertical net fluxes showed significant differences across scenarios, and the altitude at which the maximum flux occurs also varied with scenarios. Severe pollution episode analysis demonstrated the altitude-dependent and city-specific interplay between transport and photochemistry in driving episodic O3 extremes. These findings refine understanding of how altitude-scenario interactions shape O3 dynamics, supporting the coordinated control strategies."

 The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is a zonally oriented tropical band where trade winds converge, triggering deep convection and heavy rainfall, and produces about 32% of global precipitation. Studies indicate that the migration of ITCZ significantly influences the climate of tropical regions and adjacent areas. It is to be noted that during the summer monsoon (June–September) season, the ITCZ undergoes a pronounced northward shift in the South Asian monsoon region which is attributed to the displacement of zero absolute vorticity contour northward of the equator. However, changes in local precipitation are not necessarily correlated with the position of the zonal mean ITCZ, which point towards the importance of analyzing ITCZ dynamics on both regional and seasonal scales. A comparative analysis of various metrics based on precipitation, convection, moisture, and circulation reveals notable differences in estimating the ITCZ location. To address this, a multivariate probabilistic approach, combining precipitation and mean meridional mass flux, has been applied. This method effectively captures the seasonal migration of the ITCZ from boreal winter to boreal summer season, and also resolves its regional variations, providing a clearer picture of onset, peak, and withdrawal phases of South Asian Summer monsoon season."

 This study investigates the southward displacement of anomalous westerlies over the central equatorial Pacific during El Niño peak phase, using ERA5 reanalysis and long-term simulations from UKESM1.0-LL. The analysis reveals that this displacement is anchored by the seasonal migration of the tropical warm pool, thereby enhancing convection sensitivity to sea surface temperature (SST) south of the equator. The spatial structure and intensity of the westerly anomalies are further regulated by the nonlinear convection–SST relationship, with sensitivity peaking within the 27°–29 °C high SST range. Observation shows that, prior to 2000, stronger El Niño events produced more intense and spatially extensive southward-displaced westerly anomalies, whereas since the early 21st century, a La Niña–like mean-state change has weakened the convection–SST sensitivity and reduced the magnitude and extent of the westerly anomalies. Similar relationships among southward-displaced westerly anomalies, El Niño amplitude and convection-SST sensitivity were reproduced in UKESM1.0-LL model. Building on these findings, a synergistic framework is proposed, in which El Niño amplitude sets the scale of SST anomaly forcing, convection–SST sensitivity modulates the convective response, and the warm pool background constrains the spatial location of convection and associated wind anomalies. This thermodynamic mechanism complements existing dynamical explanations and highlights the role of convection–SST sensitivity in shaping El Niño-induced wind responses."

 Differential reflectivity (ZDR) observations from dual-polarimetric radars are directly related to the mean diameter of raindrops. To leverage this one-to-one relationship, the present study develops a mean diameter update (MDU) approach based on a local ensemble transform Kalman filter radar data assimilation system for ZDR assimilation, which enables the explicit updating of the mass-weighted mean diameter (Dm) of raindrops. A series of assimilation experiments using both pseudo and real radar observations is conducted to examine the feasibility of the MDU approach. The results of the scalar assimilation experiment indicate that explicitly updating Dm by the assimilated pseudo ZDR observation further enhances the accuracy of the Dm analysis. The single-pseudo-observation assimilation experiment reveals that the MDU approach effectively leverages the strong correlation between simulated ZDR and Dm, and more corrections are propagated to the grid points near the pseudo ZDR observation. In the observation system simulation experiments (OSSEs) for the Mei-Yu front case, assimilating pseudo ZDR observations with the MDU approach reduces analysis errors of simulated ZDR and rainwater state variables in each cycle. The forecast performance is the most favorable in terms of the forecast skill score and the rainfall probability when the forecast is initiated with more accurate microphysical states obtained by the MDU approach. Regarding the real-observation experiments, the analysis and forecast results are consistent with those of the OSSEs. The application of the MDU approach to both pseudo and real observations confirms its ability to exploit the intrinsic relationship between ZDR and Dm, improving the accuracy of analyses and forecasts."

 The planetary boundary layer (PBL) is the core transition zone for mass, energy, and momentum exchanges between surface and free atmosphere, significantly modulating weather, climate and human activities. However, full-day evolutions of PBL structure and PBL height (PBLH) remain limited as insufficient atmospheric vertical observations. Here, we comprehensively evaluate PBL features and PBLH detected from radiosonde, AMDAR, and lidar over Beijing, China. The PBL detections from the three platforms are significantly consistent, confirming their collective efficacy in full-day PBL monitoring. Notably, some outlies with obvious discrepancies in PBLH detection among these three platforms are extracted and their underlying causes are revealed. Then, these outliers are removed and the consistency in PBLH detected from the three platforms markedly improved. The correlation coefficient (R) and the root mean square error (RMSE) in PBLH detected from radiosonde and AMDAR range from 0.44 to 0.64 and 207.02 m to 264.85 m, respectively.

Moreover, PBLH detections from all three platforms consistently show that convective PBLH > neutral PBLH > stable PBLH. These results highlight the reliability of aircrafts' and lidar's observations in detecting PBLH and PBL thermal structures. Finally, PBL detections from the three platforms are integrated to monitor full-day PBL, compensating for the radiosonde's limitation in monitoring convective boundary layer."

 Relatively little is known about the role of upper-tropospheric factors in monitoring and predicting tropical cyclone (TC) intensity, despite their significant contribution to TC development. Using data from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) and cloud-top height (CTH) products from the Fengyun-4 A (FY-4 A) satellite, this study found that the mean CTH within a radius of 0–200 km from the TC center exhibited a correlation of 0.47 with TC intensity. This correlation was significantly higher than that of conventional predictors such as sea surface temperature (SST), which showed a correlation of 0.32. Moreover, changes in CTH typically preceded changes in TC intensity by approximately 12 to 15 h, suggesting that CTH may serve as a leading indicator of TC intensity. The study also examined the mechanisms through which CTH influences TC intensity. Results indicated that an increase in CTH was generally associated with enhanced TC outflow, which in turn strengthened the TC's secondary circulation. This process improved the efficiency of the TC Carnot heat engine and ultimately favored TC intensification."

The increased cloud cover, LW absorption and SW reflection is evident over Indian region signifying the modification in the radiation budget in the recent times. Further, more ice, liquid amount, lower cloud temperature, and bigger particles have been responsible for the rise of LW and SW reflected TOA fluxes as well."

 Urban Heat Island (UHI) and Urban Pollution Island (UPI) processes shape urban climate and air quality, yet their interaction remains insufficiently quantified, particularly in Mediterranean coastal cities. Existing research often examines these phenomena separately or over short time spans, leaving uncertainties regarding the meteorological drivers governing the UHI-UPI co-evolution. This study provides a multi-year, observation-based assessment of the coupled dynamics between Urban Heat Island Intensity (UHII) and Urban Pollution Island Intensity (UPII) in Rome (Italy), focusing on the atmospheric conditions that modulate their relationship. Air temperature, humidity, and wind speed, together with major air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2, NO, and O3), were analysed using an integrated statistical framework. Lag-correlation analysis revealed that the strongest UHII-UPII relationship occurs when nocturnal UHII is shifted backward by one day, reflecting daytime pollutant accumulation and nighttime trapping. Regression results highlighted daily mean air temperature and wind speed as the primary drivers modulating the UHII-UPII association. Spearman correlations showed negative associations between UHII and NO (−0.60), PM10 (−0.45), NO2 (−0.35), and PM2.5 (−0.34), alongside positive correlations with O3 (0.54) and NO2/NO (0.42). These correlations intensified during heatwaves and calm wind conditions, suggesting enhanced interactions under extreme weather and stagnant atmospheric conditions. UHII peaks in summer, while UPII maximizes in winter for all pollutants except for O₃, which exhibits an opposite pattern. These findings reveal a complex interplay between urban warming and pollutant accumulation, highlighting the need for integrated urban planning to address joint UHII-UPII challenges under ongoing urbanization and intensifying severe heat episodes."

 This study elucidates the mechanism by which Arctic-cooling-induced inner-continental warming over East Asia suppressed July precipitation extremes during 2013–2019 along the quasi-stationary rainy front in the outer-continental region encompassing eastern China, the Yellow Sea, and Korea (eCYK). Spatiotemporal variations in precipitation were analyzed using IMERG satellite data. At the same time, large-scale circulation, coupled with microphysical aerosol–cloud interactions and cloud properties, was investigated using ERA5 reanalysis, Terra-MODIS observations, and WRF-Chem simulations. Despite a general increase in summer precipitation and more frequent extreme events across the eCYK region, a marked weakening of extreme ascent was observed from 2013 to 2019, contributing to widespread drought conditions associated with pronounced Arctic cooling and intensified inner-continental warming. The warming-induced expansion of the upper-tropospheric Tibetan High strengthened the East Asian jet along its northern flank, while the southward intrusion of polar air contrasted with it. The resulting anomalous northwesterly flow over the eCYK region, situated near the East Asian jet exit, was further amplified by indirect circulation, which disrupted the transport of moisture from the tropical oceans surrounding Southeast Asia toward the rainy front. Terra-MODIS cloud observations revealed reduced convective cloud formation, which directly led to weaker precipitation extremes. Furthermore, WRF-Chem simulations showed that microphysical processes driven by anthropogenic aerosol indirect effects reduced precipitation by approximately 5.6 % across the eCYK region in July 2018. The combined impact of inner-continental warming and enhanced aerosol formation suppressed convective cloud development, thereby delaying the onset and reducing the intensity of extreme precipitation events."

 Sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events in the southern hemisphere were found to have strong influences on the Earth's atmosphere. However, statistical evaluations of such events were rarely carried out. This study introduces a new definition to detect and monitor SSW events in the southern hemisphere from a statistical point of view. The new method accounts characteristics of such events and uses three metrics to monitor stratospheric warmings in the three altitude layers of 20–25 km, 25–30 km and 30–35 km. If one of the metrics is continuously larger than a minimum threshold for more than 5 days, then an SSW event is detected and a main warming phase is recorded. Subsequently, the onset date, warming strength, duration, mean warming area and location of an event are recorded. The new method is applied to 42 years' reanalysis data from 1980 to 2021. Results show that the new definition can detect both strong and weak events. The frequency of all SSW events is 0.38/year and of strong events is 0.26/year in this study. Seasonally, SSW events occur most often in the three months from July to September and geographically most often in the eastern longitude side of southern polar region. It is also found that the number, strength and duration of SSW events from the latter two decades of 2001–2020 are larger than that of the previous two decades of 1981–2000 in this study though further studies are required to consolidate this conclusion."

 This study aims to quantify the climatological contribution of Mediterranean Cyclones (MCs) to snowfall in Romania for 1981–2020. Daily snowfall data from ERA5-LAND were combined with MCs composite tracks, integrating 10 different cyclone tracking methods. Our results show that out of 2230 total MCs in the Mediterranean Basin, 789 (35.4 %) influenced Romania, with 625 of these associated with snowfall events. The monthly distribution reveals that while the highest number of MCs in the basin occurs in April, their snowfall impact over Romania peaks in January and February. The spatial density of MCs highlights a preference for southeasterly and southwesterly tracks, with reinforcement of MCs from the Black Sea. Our findings reveal that approximately 50 % of the total snowfall accumulation during the cold season in Romania is associated with MC activity. This contribution shows monthly variability, with the highest MC-linked snowfall percentages in transitional months: March (49 %), November (54 %), and April (62 %), while the lowest is in December (42 %). Additionally, spatial and temporal trends highlight a declining trend in MC-related snowfall in several regions (notable in the mountains), especially in February and March, although a slight increase is noted in November and January. The analysis of extreme snowfall events at ten representative weather stations further indicates that more than 70 % of heavy snowfall episodes are triggered by MCs, emphasizing their role in high-impact snow events. These results underline the changing nature of MC influence on southeastern Europe snowfall regime, with implications for understanding future snowpack dynamics and water resource availability under climate change."

This study critically examines the physical mechanisms driving this event across scales. Employing regional reanalysis datasets, we elucidate the localized characteristics responsible for extreme precipitation and systematically address the associated uncertainties. The investigation revealed that the spatiotemporal dynamics of moisture transport played a vital role in the increased moisture influx over the region. In particular, the local convection combined with heightened atmospheric instability and intensified advection in the surrounding areas played a pivotal role in the formation of significant mid-tropospheric cyclones. These developed atmospheric phenomena are rarely observed in this region, which typically experiences tropical cyclones and depressions more frequently.

We analysed measured hourly precipitation totals at 97 stations in the Czech Republic during 1998–2014, hourly precipitation totals from a reanalysis for the period 1990–2014, and projected precipitation totals for the period 2026–2100 for two future climate scenarios (SSP5–4.5 and SSP5–8.5, which represents “middle of the road” and very strong impact of CO2 concentrations on climate, respectively).We defined a precipitation event (PE) as continuous sequence of hourly precipitation values with a threshold of at least 0.2 mm/h and a duration from 1 to 23 h. The ALADIN-CZ numerical weather prediction model was used to calculate reanalysed PE, while the ALADIN-CLIMAT-CZ climate regional model was used to calculate projected PE for 25 years long periods (2026–2050, 2051–2075 and 2076–2100). The two models are very similar and differ in the input data only. Both models belong to the so-called convection permitting models. A unique feature of the models is their high horizontal resolution of 2.3 km.We studied the four characteristics of PE in dependence on duration and ground temperature: (i) the relative frequency of PE; (ii) relative total precipitation of PE; (iii) relative mean precipitation of PE, and (iv) relative maximum precipitation of PE.We found that some characteristics of observed PE clearly differ from reanalysed data, while others are very similar. The main difference is that the reanalysed data give longer PE for higher temperature, where the measured data do not indicate any PE. In contrast, the reanalysed and projected PE show consistent results. The main result of the study is that the duration of PE does not exhibit any change with increasing temperature."

During this period, the annual average contribution of African dust to total deposition was 12,8 g m−2 yr−1, accounting for 45 % of the overall input, underscoring the influence of this source compared to other aerosol contributions such as black carbon. These findings highlight the complex interplay between atmospheric transport, aerosol composition, and snowpack dynamics in high-mountain environments. This study ultimately demonstrates the importance of sustained monitoring and cross-disciplinary research to better understand how aerosol deposition on natural systems in combination with ongoing climate change in the Pyrenees and similar alpine systems."

 This study employs the GRASP/Component approach (GRASP: Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties) to simultaneously retrieve aerosol optical properties and chemical components from ground-based sun photometer observations in Tianjin during the period 2014–2024. Component-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) showed very good agreement with ground-based sun photometer measurements (R2 ≈ 1; RMSE ≤0.01), confirming the reliability of the inversion algorithm. Correlation analysis between aerosol components and optical properties reveal that fine-mode aerosols are the primary drivers of AOD variability. Black carbon (BC) dominates aerosol absorption across all wavelengths, while brown carbon (BrC) and absorbing dust (CAI) exhibit significant absorption only at shorter wavelengths. Aerosol components present distinct seasonal patterns: BC peaks in winter; CAI and scattering dust (CNAI) increase obviously in spring, consistent with frequent dust transport; fine-mode soluble salts (FNAS) and water content (FAWC) rise in summer due to enhanced photochemical activity and high humidity, whereas their coarse-mode counterparts decline due to wet scavenging. Fine-mode aerosol components in Tianjin have decreased significantly, which is driven by policy interventions. In contrast, coarse-mode components show greater variability, likely regulated primarily by natural processes. Furthermore, columnar BC concentrations and dust concentrations show strong temporal coherence with near-surface PM2.5 and PM10, respectively, further validating the applicability of the GRASP/Component approach for long-term monitoring of regional aerosol loading and chemical components."

 The Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS), onboard GEO-KOMPSAT-2B (GK-2B), is the world's first ultraviolet-visible hyperspectral sensor from geostationary orbit, it is designed to enhance air pollutants monitoring capability across the Asia-Pacific region with unique capability on monitoring the diurnal variations of aerosol and air pollution gases. This work aims to validate the accuracy of the official aerosol optical properties products including Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) retrieved from GEMS and understand the possible causes of retrieval errors.Validation with AERONET at 443 nm shows that about 63 % (Highly Absorbing Fine, HAF), 65 % (Dust), and 58 % (Non-absorbing, NA) of GEMS AOD matchups agree within 30 % expected error (EE). GEMS AOD exhibits underestimation at high aerosol loading (AOD > 0.4) and overestimation at low aerosol loading (AOD < 0.2). For the HAF type, GEMS AOD retrieval accuracy improves in the noon/afternoon compared to morning. However, the temporal variation in retrieval accuracy of Dust and NA types are comparatively less pronounced. Regional performance of GEMS AOD for HAF type performs better in Korea and Beijing, while worse in India and equatorial regions. GEMS SSA presents good performance in Korea and Beijing, with 81.1 %(HAF)/81.3 %(NA) and 72.5 %(HAF)/65.9 %(NA) falling within ±0.05 absolute difference, respectively. The limitations of GEMS aerosol classification algorithms based on UV-AI and Visible-AI are a significant cause of errors in AOD and SSA retrieval. Additionally, a priori ALH based on CALIOP ALH climatology also contribute to the AOD retrieval error, particularly for HAF type. These factors should be considered in future algorithm."

 Raindrop size distributions (DSDs) play a key role in revealing the underlying physical processes of rainfall. This study investigates the characteristics of the DSDs in Great Britain (GB) using data collected from eleven Thies laser precipitation monitors (LPMs) between 2017 and 2019. Around one million one-minute raindrop samples were fitted to a normalized gamma drop distribution model. This study examines the DSD characteristics from both temporal (seasons) and spatial (geography and topography) perspectives, considering different rain types (stratiform and convective) and rain rate clusters. The results indicate that the average mass-weighted mean diameter Dm and the average normalized intercept parameter log10Nw are influenced by geographical and atmospheric conditions. The Dm tends to be lower and log10Nw is higher in the western and hilly regions, with the opposite pattern observed over the eastern plain of GB. Both parameters are strongly correlated with rain rate. Compared to subtropical/tropical regions, stratiform rain in GB exhibits smaller Dm and larger log10Nw, while the characteristics of convective rain align with the maritime-like cluster. Significant differences in Dm are observed between stratiform (0.78–1.00 mm) and convective (1.30–1.74 mm) rain, with both showing a significant negative linear correlation with log10Nw. Moreover, extreme convective events show distinct seasonality, with larger Dm and lower log10Nw during the warm season. Furthermore, a bimodal distribution is observed for log10Nw in light rain events over western and hilly regions, highlighting the complexity of microphysical processes associated with small raindrops. The characteristics of DSDs observed in this study provide valuable insights for future investigations into GB's precipitation formation and quantitative precipitation estimation using weather radar."

 Based on the hindcast data from the operational climate prediction model of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), the correction effects of precipitation prediction biases over the Tibetan Plateau during summer, particularly in July from 2006 to 2020, were systematically evaluated using the non-parametric percentile mapping (CDF) and Kalman filter-type adaptive (KEM) bias correction methods. The results indicate that the CDF method performs better in correcting systematic biases, while the KEM method shows more significant improvements in spatial correlation and anomalous trends. On the seasonal scale, the CDF method effectively reduces the overall systematic precipitation bias in the plateau region, especially decreasing bias by 80 % in the south, with an overall spatial correlation ranging between 0.72 and 0.79, while the KEM method mainly reduces precipitation bias in the central plateau by 60 % to 80 %, achieving spatial correlations above 0.8 in six years. On the subseasonal scale, both bias correction methods exhibit effects on bias and spatial correlation similar to those observed on the seasonal scale, resulting in a modest improvement in the ability to discriminate precipitation events, with an increase of 0.01 in the area under the ROC curve (AROC). The KEM method effectively enhances the prediction capability for precipitation anomaly trends by increasing the overall PS score by 6.34, reaching 84.59. Particularly for precipitation prediction correction at varying thresholds in July, the KEM method yields results that more closely align with observations, demonstrating optimal performance for moderate to heavy precipitation. In summary, CDF and KEM are functionally complementary: CDF removes pointwise systematic bias and standardizes amplitude distributions, and applying KEM subsequently to the CDF-corrected fields restores spatial–phase coherence, refines the spatial structure of anomaly trends, and suppresses low-end outliers. Combining the two methods in a “CDF first, then KEM” sequence and integrating outputs via performance-driven weighted fusion leverages their respective strengths without requiring additional observations, enabling more targeted improvement of precipitation anomaly-trend correction across sub-seasonal to seasonal transition scales over complex plateau terrain."

 The chemical characteristics and photochemistry of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were investigated at Shennongjia (SNJ), a high-altitude site in central China, from July to August 2023. The mean mixing ratio of total VOCs (TVOCs) was 14.61 ± 1.64 ppbv, dominated by alkanes (35.4 %) and carbonyls (29.4 %). The northeastern air mass exhibited the highest VOC concentration (16.33 ± 7.62 ppbv), followed by the southeastern air mass (10.45 ± 3.25 ppbv). Analysis of potential source contribution function (PSCF) and concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) identified central/eastern Hubei and the Sichuan Basin as major source regions for VOCs at SNJ. An observation-based photochemical box model was employed to examine VOC photochemistry and in-situ O3 formation. Extremely low nitric oxide (NO) mixing ratios led to incomplete HOx cycling, and VOCs actively participated in the generation of free radicals. In-situ O₃ formation was governed by regionally transported air masses with distinct VOC compositions. Northwestern air masses, characterized by high temperature, high carbonyls, and low relative humidity (RH) despite lower TVOCs (8.10 ± 1.29 ppbv), yielded the highest net O3 production rate (1.27 ± 0.33 ppbv/h), with formaldehyde photolysis contributing 13.3 % to hydroperoxyl radical (HO2) generation. Conversely, the southeastern air masses, despite carrying the highest TVOC load, inhibited O3 formation due to elevated RH. Formaldehyde and isoprene dominated photochemical reactivity. Our results highlight that VOC speciation, especially reactive carbonyls and biogenic VOCs, critically controls radical cycling and O3 dynamics in remote regions."

 To construct appropriate initial perturbation methods for convection-permitting ensemble prediction system (CPEPS), this study analyzed the sensitivity of CPEPS to three single-scale singular vector (SV) perturbations with different configurations, and the strengths of multiscale SV initial perturbations relative to the single-scale SV perturbations were revealed. First, the SVs with a horizontal resolution of 2.5° and 1.5° exhibit a single-peaked energy norm structure, capturing initial condition uncertainties in the middle and upper troposphere. In contrast, the SVs with a horizontal resolution of 0.5° display a double-peaked distribution over targeted areas in southern China, capturing uncertainties in the lower atmosphere. Diverse SV initial perturbations have different perturbation magnitudes, ranges, energy spectra, and baroclinic instability characteristics. As forecast times increase, the 0.5° SV perturbations capture the perturbation energy growth associated with low-level humidity, whereas the 1.5° SV and 2.5° SV initial perturbations capture the perturbation growth associated with high-level winds. Second, among the single-scale SV initial perturbations, the 0.5° SV perturbations outperform the others in terms of spread–skill relationships for all variables, and probabilistic forecast skill for the mixing ratio, other low-level variables, and rainfall at most forecast hours. However, the 2.5° and 1.5° SV perturbations demonstrate better probabilistic forecast skills for winds and temperature at middle and high levels. Third, the multiscale SV initial perturbations incorporate multiscale characteristics, and further improve perturbation energy, spread–skill relationships, and probabilistic forecast skill for both dynamical variables and precipitation. Overall, these findings offer valuable insights for developing multiscale initial perturbation methods for CPEPS."

 Airborne microorganisms are integral components of the atmosphere, influencing air quality, climate processes, and bacterial dispersal across ecosystems. Their ecological and health implications are particularly pronounced in high-altitude environments, where bacteria are exposed to extreme conditions such as intense ultraviolet (UV) radiation, desiccation, and low temperatures. However, the lack of rapid and accurate detection methods limits our ability to monitor and understand airborne bacterial dynamics in these regions. This study establishes an optimized protocol for quantifying airborne bacteria collected on air filters using flow cytometry (FCM), with a particular focus on applications in high-altitude environments. The method was refined through orthogonal experiments to determine optimal conditions for cell detachment and dispersion. Key steps include fixation with glutaraldehyde, dispersal using Tween 80 and sodium pyrophosphate, combined with 20 min of ultrasonic treatment, and elution with PBS buffer. This optimized protocol was applied to assess spatial and temporal variations in airborne bacterial abundance across three high-altitude regions: urban, lake, and glacier. The results showed that the airborne bacterial concentration was the highest in urban areas (3.3 × 104 cells/m3), followed by lakes (1.0 × 104 cells/m3) and glaciers (7.7 × 103 cells/m3). The temporal variation of bacterial concentration in urban areas peaked in July and reached a trough in September. Model analysis indicated that PM10 was the main factor regulating bacterial concentration in urban air, while organic matter particles dominated in natural environments. The protocol developed in this study provides a rapid, reliable, and field-applicable tool for monitoring airborne bacterial abundance in high-altitude regions, offering valuable insights into atmospheric bacterial ecology and its environmental determinants."

 In June 2024 extremely hot weather was observed in Southeast Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean. Based on ensemble seasonal forecasts of the INM RAS Earth system model (INMCM6M), that is run operationally at the Hydrometeorological Research Center of Russia for monthly calculation of global seasonal forecasts, the prediction of tropospheric temperature anomalies in this region is studied. Obtained results show that, among the causes of this heatwave, the most important role was played by the reduced accumulation of soil moisture during the preceding months and the reduced cooling of the lower troposphere due to evaporation stress. The analysis of observational data indicates the increased (especially in the first half of June 2024) meridional transport of warm air masses along the western edge of the heatwave region towards the central Volga region and the north-east of European Russia (north-westward of Ural Mountains). Model experiments allow to conclude, that the meridional transport of air masses from the warmer region to the north, rather than particularly extreme warming in the Eastern Mediterranean, led to the formation of a region of positive temperature anomalies in the north-east of European Russia."

 Previous observation verified that large turbulent eddies (LEs) prevail in the tropical cyclones and significantly affect the vertical mixing in the planetary boundary layer. Recently, Li and Pu (2021) had parameterized the vertical eddy diffusivity (VED) associated with LEs (LP scheme). To further investigate their rationality, we conducted 79 sensitivity simulations of Super Typhoon Lekima (2019) through WRF model to examine the critical processes in LP scheme. The simulation indicates that the weak convergence flow lead to LEs covers more in the inflow region. Subsequently, strong negative momentum flux associated with LEs disrupts the inflow structure, resulting in a poor typhoon simulation. Adding a moderate divergence and Ri threshold, i.e., LED03-RI30, could suppress the excessive vertical mixing in the inflow region to ensure the typhoon intensification and lead to an intense typhoon as observed. Reducing the scale factor of LE intensity in LP scheme also result in stronger typhoon, however, it delays the intensification of typhoon. The use of planetary boundary layer height, fixed height, or height scaling can potentially improve the Hm (the height of maximum LE intensity) calculation and thus optimal LE parameterization. However, due to the gradient wind balance, the enhanced wind speed induced by the LE parameterization tends to result in a lower sea-level pressure than the best-track. Validation simulations of Typhoon Hato (2017) and Maria (2018) show a weak effect of LP scheme. Although VED has been enhanced, the vertical velocity gradient in typhoon Hato and Maria are weaker, making the flux, which is associated with LEs, is weaker than that in Typhoon Lekima. Therefore, the vertical structure should be taken into account in the LE parameterization such as LP scheme."

 The western North Pacific region has experienced Tropical Cyclones (TCs)-caused damages, including the heavy rainfall disaster brought by Typhoon Hinnamnor (2022) in South Korea. The future changes in the intensity and frequency of such a Violent Typhoon and its associated rainfall are global concern. This study adopted the storyline approach using the Pseudo-Global Warming (PGW) method to quantify the impact of climate change on Typhoon Hinnamnor and its associated rainfall. Furthermore, we employed the risk-based approach to examine the changes in frequency and intensity of TCs affecting South Korea. Our storyline approach showed the increase of maximum sustained wind speed by 15 %, the decrease of minimum sea level pressure by 2 %, and the increase of basin-average rainfall by 29.4 % over the Nakdonggang basin in the PGW experiment considering the 2090s SST condition under the SSP2–4.5 scenario in the Typhoon Hinnamnor simulation. Our risk-based approach examining the identified TCs in large ensemble climate dataset found that the maximum sustained wind speed increased by 14 % for Violent Typhoons under +4 K climate, while the minimum sea level pressure decreased by 1 %. Overall, the identified changes in the TC intensity were comparable between the storyline and risk-based approaches, highlighting the robustness of our findings. Furthermore, we analyzed the changes in frequency of TCs affecting South Korea under climate change in the risk-based approach. While we found a decrease (−36 %) in frequency of all category TCs affecting South Korea, the frequency of Violent Typhoons increased (+27 %) under the 4 K warming climate. This study provides useful insights on the TC and its rainfall changes under climate change, which can be incorporated in the regional disaster risk assessment."

 Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) observations at alpine sites contribute significantly to improving the understanding of aerosol–cloud interactions under background atmospheric conditions. However, measurements of CCN activity under low supersaturation (SS) conditions in such environments remain limited due to technical constraints. In this study, aerosol microphysical and chemical properties were measured at Mt. Hua, in central China. Using an Aerodynamic Aerosol Classifier–Cloud Condensation Nuclei Counter (AAC–CCNC) system, size-resolved CCN activity at low SS conditions (0.07 % and 0.12 %) was characterized, and the corresponding hygroscopicity parameter (κ) was derived. During the campaign, the site was rarely influenced by local emissions or long-range transport of air pollutants, allowing the observations to represent the CCN activity of aerosols in the lower free troposphere over this continental region. The results show aerosols at Mt. Hua exhibited moderate CCN activity, with average κ values of 0.25 and 0.30 at SSs of 0.07 % and 0.12 %, respectively. The calculated CCN number concentrations averaged 2.3 × 102 cm−3 and 5.1 × 102 cm−3, and were in good agreement with concurrent bulk CCN measurements. The derived CCN spectrum parameters, C and k (NCCN(SS) = C × SSk), were 8.13 × 103 cm−3 and 1.3 on average, consistent with values observed at other alpine sites in polluted continental regions. No significant diurnal variation in aerosol CCN activity was observed, indicating a weak impact of local emissions or photochemical reactions on aerosol particle size and aerosol hygroscopicity in the lower free troposphere. Further analysis revealed that variations in CCN activity influenced by sulfate and nitrate were opposite, highlighting the complex effects of aerosol chemical reactions on aerosol CCN activity. This study offers new insights into aerosol CCN activity at the mountain and can promote the study of aerosol–cloud interactions under background conditions in the continental region."

 Ozone (O3) pollution in urban environments arises from complex photochemical interactions among volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and meteorological factors, yet the nonlinear and synergistic effects remain poorly constrained. Existing studies have identified key roles of humidity, temperature, and emission precursors, but how their interactions regulate O3 production under varying conditions is less understood. Here, we applied machine learning with Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to disentangle the contributions of chemical precursors and meteorological factors on O3 formation in Huzhou, using continuous monitoring data from May to October 2023. Meteorological drivers accounted for 47.1 % of the total impact, with relative humidity (RH) and temperature (T) dominating. RH above 70 % consistently inhibited O3 production and attenuated temperature effects. Chemical precursors contributed 52.9 %; within the chemical contribution, OVOCs (27.7 %) promoting O3, while NO2 (25.9 %) and alkenes (15.8 %) exhibited negative effects. The positive role of OVOCs diminished under high-NOx conditions due to constrained radical propagation. During O3 pollution episodes, meteorological influence increased by 15 % relative to clean periods, primarily via RH, while VOCs contributions declined and NO2 effects strengthened, indicating a shift in the dominant O3 drivers. Combining SHAP attribution with theoretical calculations identified propylene, styrene, and acetone as key VOC species. Propylene and styrene exhibited negative effects on O3 formation, with styrene's suppression intensified under elevated NO2 and RH, whereas acetone enhanced O3 particularly under higher T. These findings highlight the dynamic chemical-meteorological interactions shaping O3 production and provide a framework for rapidly diagnosing local O3 drivers to inform targeted mitigation strategies."

 The measurement of accurate full drop size distribution (DSD) is critical for its precise modeling and hydro-meteorological application. However, its measurement hinders from instrumental limitation. We explored a way of constructing full DSDs by combining the 2D-Video Distrometer (2DVD) and Meteorological Particle Spectrometer (MPS) measurements based on instrumental uncertainty statistics, while other existing methods use a fixed critical diameter and weighting. First, the median relative bias (RB) of number concentration for each diameter between the two distrometers is used to determine the diameter range of their merging. Second, the weighting factors within the range were derived from normalized standard deviations of MPS and 2DVD number concentration by diameter during quasi-homogeneous microphysical process. The accuracy of derived full DSD is verified with the rainfall rate (R) and radar reflectivity (Z) from other independent instruments such as PLUVIO and Precipitation Occurrence Sensor System (POSS) that provide the best possible reference of R and Z. The new method is superior to the existing methods, providing relatively lower error statistics during summer rainfall events in 2022. Additionally, the impact of the new method is analyzed on DSD variability using double-moment scaling normalization to derive a stable generic function. Four different triple-moment normalization methods are also employed to describe the reduction of DSD variability. The results demonstrate that the new full DSD significantly reduces DSD variability and better provides stable generic function of DSDs."

 Dust aerosols contribute over half of the total atmospheric aerosol mass and play a critical role in climate and environmental processes. Using the observations of 13 AERONET sites and CALIPSO from 2006 to 2021, this study characterizes the optical and vertical properties of dust aerosols over eight main desert regions of the Sahara, Middle East, Thar, Taklamakan, Gobi, North American, Simpson, and Atacama deserts. AERONET observations reveal that the Sahara exhibits the highest annual AOD (0.47) and lowest AE (0.34), while the Atacama and Gobi show the lowest AOD (0.049) and highest AE (1.20), respectively. Most deserts exhibit a seasonal pattern of high AOD and low AE in spring and summer. Aerosols in these deserts are typically unimodal volume size distributions (VSDs) in both fine and coarse modes, while a bimodal distribution in fine mode in the Sahara. Although the peak radius varies little seasonally in most deserts, the concentration increases markedly in spring and summer. The fine mode aerosols have important impact on the aerosol effective radius and concentration in the Gobi and North America desert. CALIPSO identifies four high value centers of dust AOD (DAOD), with the summer maximum over the deserts of Sahara, Middle East, and Thar, and the spring maximum over the deserts of Taklamakan and Gobi. Dust extinction coefficients decay exponentially with the altitudes, showing the slowest vertical decrease in summer and the largest near-surface extinction in spring. Although the single-dust-layer structure dominates in most deserts, the double-dust-layer structure exceed 30 % in the deserts of Sahara, Middle East, Thar, and Taklamakan, with higher occurrence rate in summer and spring and the inter-layer spacing ranging from 0.4 to 0.8 km. Both the dust layer top and base are highest in summer and lowest in winter and the mean layer thickness ranges from 1 to 2.5 km. Significant declining trends are found in dust top heights over the Taklamakan and Gobi, and in layer thickness over the Taklamakan and North America."

 The Tibetan Plateau (TP) plays a critical role in regional and global climate and warms faster than the global average. Black carbon (BC), the strongest light-absorbing atmospheric aerosol, aging to enhances its light absorption capability (quantified by the absorption enhancement factor, Eabs), thereby amplifying its radiative effects. Quantifying BC Eabs is crucial for understanding the TP's warming but remains scarce due to a lack of in-situ data. This study quantified BC Eabs in situ measurements with a Thermodenuder-coupled Aethalometer at three TP sites: Tibet University (TU, 3650 m, urban-influenced) in Lhasa, Purog Kangri (PK, 4960 m, central remote glacier), Mount Everest (ME, 5260 m, South Asian transport corridor) during the post-monsoon period in 2024. Results show that Eabs is elevated at the remote sites (1.99 ± 0.48 at ME; 1.96 ± 0.56 at PK) compared to that at TU (1.14 ± 0.10). Meteorological analysis suggests that enhanced Eabs at remote sites is due to aged BC from long-range transport, while lower Eabs at TU reflects local emissions of less aged BC. Radiative transfer simulations show that coatings contributed up to 46.7 % of BC's direct radiative effect at PK. These findings provide a valuable dataset and improved understanding of BC radiative effects over the TP, offering an important observational basis for accurately evaluating aerosol radiative effects and their impacts on regional climate change."

 Vertical distributions of gaseous nitrous acid (HONO) and formaldehyde (HCHO) are crucial for hydroxyl radical (OH) production and atmospheric oxidative capacity at different altitudes. This study utilized multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) to measure the vertical profiles of HONO, HCHO, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and aerosols in Guangzhou, China, from July 2019 to June 2020. The average vertical profiles of HONO and NO2 displayed an exponential trend, while HCHO and aerosols exhibited a near-Gaussian distribution. Direct emissions accounted for 29 % of HONO sources, with heterogeneous processes being predominant. The conversion rate of NO2 to HONO (CHONO) at 1.0 km was 3.08 times greater than that at ground level. HONO formation via NO2 heterogeneous reactions was influenced by temperature, relative humidity (RH), and solar radiation intensity (SRI). The HONO/NO2 ratio initially decreased with rising temperature, reaching a minimum between 20 and 25 °C, and increased with RH below approximately 85 %, and SRI above 700 W/m2. Photolysis rates of HONO (JHONO) and HCHO (JHCHO) increased linearly with altitude, peaking between 12:00–13:00 LT, with JHONO significantly exceeding JHCHO at the surface. Near the surface, OH production from HONO (POH(HONO)) was greater than from HCHO (POH(HCHO)), while at altitudes of 0.2–2.2 km, HONO contributed less to OH formation compared to HCHO. This study highlights the significance of the vertical observations of HONO and HCHO for understanding their vertical differences in evolution, sources, and atmospheric oxidizing contributions."

 This study investigates the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of isolated convections (ICs) (a total of 209,387) over North China during the warm season of 2016–2021 and the dynamic and thermodynamic mechanisms in their upscale convective growth (UCG), using composite radar reflectivity observations, ERA5 reanalysis and a modified convective cell tracking algorithm. Results reveal that cluster cells (CCs) and nonlinear systems (NLs) dominate the convective activities, while linear (LR) and bow-echo (BE) systems only account for ∼7 %. About 52 (0.07 %) of completely isolated convections (CICs) and 216 (0.16 %) of ordinary isolated convections (OICs) can eventually undergo upscale growth, and 54.3 % of CICs still maintain individual state in their lifespan. The initiation (CI) and dissipation of ICs mainly occur over the mountains, hills, and Bohai coast. Both CI and UCG peak at 14–16 LST in diurnal cycle, while UCG lags behind by 77 min. 82.1 % of cells propagate around eastward after CI and rapidly grow within 50 km. The environmental conditions and topography jointly dominate UCG process. Terrain blocking and weak mid-level vertical wind shear (VWS) over mountains prolong the duration from CI to UCG and reduce the movement speed. Higher SBCAPE, PW, lower LCL and stronger 0–1 km VWS over the plains and hills favor the UCG process compared to these over high-elevation areas, whereas UCG over the latter depends more on 0–6 km VWS due to higher LCL. These findings first provide the long-term characteristics of ICs over North China and diagnostic references for UCG occurrence across various terrains."

 This study presents the assimilation impact of all-sky water vapour (WV) radiance observations from the recently launched Indian geostationary satellite (INSAT-3DS) into the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. To evaluate the impact of INSAT-3DS data, three identical assimilation experiments were conducted in July 2024 over South Asia: a control run (WCNT) without INSAT-3DS Imager WV radiance assimilation, a clear-sky WV radiance assimilation run (WCLR), and an all-sky WV radiance assimilation run (WCLD). The assimilation impact was assessed by comparing the WRF analyses simulated brightness temperature (TB) against independent satellite observations from Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS), High-Resolution Infrared Sounder/4 (HIRS/4), and Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) sensors. Results demonstrate that all-sky assimilation significantly increases the number of assimilated observations (∼300 %) compared to clear-sky assimilation, leading to analyses that are more consistent with independent satellite measurements. Short-range forecast evaluations confirm the advantages of all-sky radiance (ASR) assimilation, with improved predictions of simulated WV TB, moisture, and temperature fields compared to clear-sky radiance (CSR) assimilation. When verified against INSAT-3DS WV channel observations, WCLD forecasts consistently exhibit reduced bias and root mean square deviation (RMSD) compared to WCLR and WCNT forecasts. These results highlight the potential of ASR assimilation to enhance the accuracy of the WRF model predictions, particularly in summer monsoon-affected regions where cloud-affected radiances contain crucial atmospheric information. Overall, this study underscores the importance of ASR assimilation in improving the representation of atmospheric moisture and advancing short-range weather forecasts."

 This study leverages the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, integrated with the three-dimensional variational (3DVAR) data assimilation system, to conduct a high-resolution simulation of a thunderstorm gale event in Beijing. By assimilating observations from Automatic Weather Stations (AWSs), the impact of different observation errors is systematically assessed and explored. This study demonstrates that varying observation errors significantly influence the performance of the wind analysis and forecast. Mitigating observation errors in cases with significant observation-minus-background (OMB) discrepancies enhances the reliability of observations with large departures from the background, resulting in greater analysis increments and improved agreement with the assimilated observations. In contrast, the Desroziers method computes observation error covariances through statistical analysis of OMB and observation-minus-analysis (OMA) residuals. This approach systematically assigns higher error estimates, enabling the assimilation of more observations with reduced weights while enhancing spatial continuity in the analysis. Both experiments employing modified observation error parameters demonstrated superior predictive accuracy compared to the default configuration, enabling more precise identification of strong wind regions while mitigating overestimation tendencies. Statistical metrics (BIAS, RMSE) and FSS scores confirm their superior performance, particularly in extreme wind speed forecasting, with Exp_D05 outperforming all other experiments. These findings highlight the importance of optimized observation error estimates in AWSs data assimilation for improved wind analysis and forecasting."

 The critical role of light-absorbing aerosol black carbon (BC) in modifying the Earth's atmosphere and climate system warrants detailed characterization of its microphysical properties. The present study examines the BC microphysical properties (size distributions and mixing state) and their impact on the light-absorption characteristics over a semi-urban tropical coastal location in Southern Peninsular India. The measurements of refractory BC (rBC) properties, carried out using the single particle soot photometer during 2018–2021, covering four distinct air mass conditions (Marine, Continental, Mixed-1, and Mixed-2), were used for this purpose. These were supported by measurements of non-refractory submicron particulate matter (NR-PM1) mass loadings and the core-shell Mie theory model for BC-containing particles. The results suggested that the BC particles exhibited varying sizes (mass median diameters from 0.181 ± 0.079 μm to 0.202 ± 0.064 μm) and relative coating thicknesses (RCT) (1.3–1.6) under distinct air mass conditions. These characteristics reflected varying source/sink strengths, aging processes of BC, and potential condensable coating material. The aerosol system during the Marine air mass period has lower BC (∼ 0.67 ± 0.57 μg m−3) and NR-PM1 (12.06 ± 10.81 μg m−3) mass concentrations, and the lowest RCT on BC (∼ 1.34 ± 0.14). However, the other periods with continental influence depicted significant coatings on BC (mean RCT >1.5). The coatings on BC particles exhibited daytime enhancement, driven by photochemically produced condensable material, a contrasting diurnal pattern to that of other BC properties. Interestingly, the RCT on BC increased and/or remained invariant with increasing relative humidity (RH) until RH ≤82 %, and subsequently showed a decline. This is possibly due to deliquescence and subsequent detachment of the coating material (likely, inorganics) from the BC cores. Despite this, the BC particles retained coatings of ∼30–50 % of their core sizes even under high RH (>85 %), indicating the potential role of secondary organics as coatings. The changes in the BC mixing state resulted in a significant alteration to its light-absorption properties. The mean light-absorption enhancement of BC (compared to uncoated BC) ranged from 1.36 ± 0.14 for the Marine air mass periods to 1.58 ± 0.15 for the Continental air mass periods, whereas the overall mass absorption cross-sections of BC varied between 7.91 ± 0.91 to 9.03 ± 0.84 m2/g at 550 nm. The key implication of this study is that changes to the BC mixing state, caused by multiple underlying processes unique to tropical atmospheric conditions, can lead to a significant enhancement in its light-absorption characteristics, which can lead to a notable increase in the positive radiative forcing of BC."

 This study develops an advanced cloud microphysics scheme based on the LiuMa cloud microphysics scheme, which explicitly incorporates aerosol-cloud interaction (ACI) parameterizations, allowing for a detailed investigation of the effects of aerosols on cloud microphysical and precipitation processes. The new scheme was employed into the CMA-MESO V5.0 regional model, and a simulation of severe convective precipitation case in the HuaBei region was carried out to assess the impact of aerosol concentration on hydrometeor mixing ratio, microphysical conversion rates, and precipitation formation within both warm and cold cloud processes. Aerosol sensitivity experiments (clean, control, polluted scenarios) reveal that higher aerosol concentrations (polluted) enhance light rain and extreme heavy rain but reduce moderate/heavy rain. The clean experiment shows greater spatiotemporal variability in heavy precipitation compared to control experiment, indicating the aerosol significantly modulate the spatio-temporal distribution of precipitation. Microphysical budget analysis reveals that higher aerosol concentration enhances cloud droplet concentration while suppressing warm rain processes such as autoconversion and collision-coalescence. In ice-phase processes, aerosols reduce cloud water freezing and riming accretion efficiency, particularly affecting graupel development and subsequent melting, thereby weakening surface precipitation. Batch simulations of 57 precipitation events (June–August 2018) demonstrate that the aerosol-aware LiuMa scheme improves the threat scores (TS) and equitable threat scores (ETS) of forecast performance for extreme (>50 mm, ΔTS: +14.9 %, ΔETS: +15.6 %) precipitation in the CMA-MESO model. Notably, the TS (ETS) for extreme precipitation increases by 24.6 % (26.0 %) under polluted conditions (a total of 19 precipitation events). These results indicate the crucial role of ACI parameterization in enhancing the accuracy of heavy rainfall forecasts."

 With the contribution of Chinese sprite enthusiast, the observation of 165 Transient Luminous Events (TLEs) (almost over 98 % being sprites) over Central South China during the delayed pre-rainy season of South China on three consecutive nights of May 10th–12th, 2021 are reported. The convective cores exhibited the minimum Temperature of Black Body (TBB) of cloud top within the range of 180 to 190 K within 10 min of sprite occurrence, which extended up to or beyond the tropopause (∼ 17 km, 195 K) and was colder (more than 15 K) than that of regular TLEs-producing mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) in the central USA. However, the sprite distribution was closely associated with regions of TBB averaging 216.5 K, about 10 K warmer than that of the central USA. This distinct behavior of TLEs-producing thunderstorms in South China can be attributed to a combination of intricate meteorological and topographic factors. Firstly, in addition to the influence of the Subtropical High Pressure Zone, the positioned farther west and north compared to previous years caused the convergence of warm water vapor from the South China Sea and cold air from the north, coupled with the Southwest Vortex (SWV) and multi-layer jets, fostering intense convection. Besides, the intricate plateau and mountain topography are likely also responsible for the distinct behavior of TLEs-producing thunderstorm. Thus, more attention should be paid on thunderstorms in South China during the pre-rainy season for the future study of massive sprite outbreak.Plain language summaryTLEs occur globally according to observation of the Imager for Sprites and Upper Atmospheric Lightning. However, reports of large-scale TLE groups in Asia were rare. This study, conducted with the contribution of Chinese sprite enthusiast, presents the important observation of Transient Luminous Events generated by a long lasting mesoscale convective system complex over Central South China. By analyzing lightning activity, weather conditions, and geographical features, this article reveals the characteristics of massive TLEs-producing thunderstorm and analyzes the meteorological reasons for the formation of the parent thunderstorms. TBB indicated the higher cloud top of parent thunderstorm than that of typical TLEs-producing MCSs in central USA. However, TLEs were largely confined to regions of TBB lower than that of regular TLEs-producing MCSs over central USA. Such distinct behavior of the parent thunderstorm is found in the delayed pre-rainy season of South China and to be attributed to a combination of intricate meteorological and topographic factors. The Subtropical High Pressure Zone, positioned farther west and north compared to previous years, led to the convergence of warm water vapor from the South China Sea and cold air from the north. The presence of the Southwest Vortex, coupled with multi-layer jets, ultimately fostered the development of intense convection. Additionally, the intricate plateau and mountain topography are likely also responsible for the distinct behavior of TLEs-producing thunderstorm."

 The atmospheric electric field in fair-weather conditions, typically quantified by the Potential Gradient (PG, which is the inverse of the vertical component of the electric field), is a fundamental element of the global electric circuit. It is sensitive to multiple scales of influence, including global atmospheric dynamics, local meteorological conditions (e.g., dust, fog, clouds), and anthropogenic factors such as air pollution. In this study, we analyze PG measurements from a newly deployed electric field mill installed in the metropolitan area of Tel-Aviv area, the urban part of central Israel, which has been operational since August 2024. This instrument is part of a broader observational network that includes nearby meteorological and air quality monitoring stations, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of the factors influencing PG variability.Focusing on fair-weather conditions, we investigate both diurnal, weekly, and seasonal patterns of PG and their relation to pollutant concentrations. Our findings reveal a distinct temporal correlation between the PG and NOₓ levels during the morning and evening rush hours, indicating rapid atmospheric responses to traffic-related emissions. In contrast, elevated PM2.5 concentrations are associated with a delayed PG response, likely due to their longer atmospheric residence time and different microphysical interactions. Furthermore, a pronounced ‘weekend effect’ is observed, with reduced pollution and correspondingly altered PG values on weekends compared with weekdays, highlighting the measurable impact of human activity on atmospheric electricity.These results enhance our understanding of the interplay between urban air pollution and the local electric field, and emphasize the importance of integrating air quality data into atmospheric electricity studies, particularly in densely populated regions where anthropogenic influences are pronounced, with implications for public health."

 Regional ozone pollution has emerged as a key challenge within China's Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan, thus, comprehensively understanding its formation mechanism is essential for continuous improvement of air quality in China. Here, an overall increase of 5.1 % in near-surface ozone concentrations is observed during 2014–2023 in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region. The annual average number of regional pollution days in YRD stands at 32.7 over the recent ten years, and a significant rising trend of ozone levels on regional clean days is also noticed. This highlights the persistent nature of ozone pollution and the critical need for targeted control strategies in YRD. Our study reveals that the western Pacific Subtropical High shifts significantly southward (SWPSH) on regional pollution days compared to clean days, which results in intensified surface shortwave radiation, suppressed rainfall, weakened horizontal winds near the surface, and the development of an anomalous anticyclone with associated subsiding airflows over YRD. Such conditions are greatly beneficial to the accumulation of ozone by restraining air outflows after its enhanced photochemical formation in YRD. Subsequently, based on the GEOS-Chem simulation, we notice that local ozone, which is the dominant contributor to the surface ozone in YRD, has a positive concentration anomaly of 6.9 μg·m−3 (accounting for 44.7 % to the total ozone anomaly in YRD, the same as below) on regional pollution days. Furthermore, the North China Plain (NCP) and Twain-Hu Region (THR) ozone together exhibit high anomalies of 4.5 μg·m−3 (28.7 %) in YRD on these pollution days, which are driven by the abnormally northwestern and southwestern winds in source regions of NCP and THR, respectively. In addition to the substantial role of local ozone production, this study emphasizes the exceptional importance of regional ozone transport regulated by the SWPSH-driven anticyclone for ozone pollution in YRD, thereby providing a scientific basis for coordinated air quality management."

 Monitoring atmospheric stability is important for forecasting convection. To compensate for the insufficient temporal resolution of traditional techniques, precise precipitable water vapor (PWV) derived from BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) observations was employed to establish a model for retrieving the minute-level K-Index and Showalter Index for convective events. BDS-derived PWV (BDS-PWV) revealed the bias and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.5 and 1.9 mm, respectively, with respect to the Fifth Generation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis (ERA5). Compared with radiosonde data, the corresponding values were − 0.5 and 2.5 mm, respectively. This indicates the feasibility of using BDS-PWV for further modeling. Subsequently, two atmospheric stability indices were retrieved from the BDS-PWV using the traditional least-squares (LSQ), backpropagation neural network (BPNN), and random forest (RF) methods. The evaluation process adopted both the ERA5 reanalysis and satellite-based products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The results indicated that the RF method performed best among the three methods. Taking ERA5 reanalysis as the reference, the average correlation coefficients, RMSEs, and mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) are 0.98/0.97, 2.8/1.3 °C, and 3.8 %/5.0 % for the K-Index and Showalter Index, respectively. A similar performance was obtained when compared with MODIS products with average correlation coefficients, RMSEs, and MAPEs of 0.94/0.90, 4.8/1.9 °C, and 6.1 %/7.4 %, respectively. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using the BDS-retrieved minute-level K-Index and Showalter Index for meteorological studies. Finally, the two modeled atmospheric stability indices were applied to three representative convective events that occurred in 2024 over Beijing and its surrounding areas. Temporal analysis of the two indices clearly revealed the onset and sustained processes of the convective events. Moreover, the forecasting results based on the two atmospheric stability indices demonstrated their potential for indicating convective rainfall. The proposed BDS-retrieved minute-level atmospheric stability indices can be useful indicators for monitoring and nowcasting atmospheric convection."

 Two unsurprisingly extreme O3 pollution events hit the North China Plain (NCP) on 14–15th and 22–24th June of 2023, with peak O3 concentrations exceeding the regional climatological mean by approximately 29.88 % and 31.76 %, respectively. This paper investigates the characteristics and the multiscale meteorological drivers of these extreme events. The results show that the O3 peaks linked to higher near-surface temperatures, lower relative humidity in the near-surface layer, weaker near surface wind speeds, and stronger shortwave radiation in the NCP. While these meteorological conditions were primarily modulated by a Rossby wave train at 500 hPa over the upper and middle latitudes of Eurasia. The HadGEM3-GC31-LL model from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), the sensitive experiment based on the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and the linear baroclinic model effectively captured this wave train. And combined with observations, our analysis demonstrates that the wave train was triggered by a positive sea surface temperature anomaly in the North Atlantic during May–June."

 Accurate retrieval of water vapor vertical profiles is crucial for numerical weather prediction and climate change research. To address the problems of low spatiotemporal resolution and strong susceptibility to cloud interference in traditional sounding methods, this study proposes combining infrared hyperspectral data with ground-based GNSS observations and applying machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy of water vapor profile retrievals. Using NOAA-20/CrIS infrared hyperspectral data combined with GNSS-derived Precipitable Water Vapor (GNSS-PWV) observations, water vapor vertical profiles over Europe were retrieved based on Transformer and Random Forest (RF) models. Radiosonde data from IGRA were used as the reference truth, and the results were compared with the official CrIS product (CrIS-EDR). The results show that, under clear-sky conditions, incorporating GNSS-PWV data reduced the average RMSE of the Transformer and RF models by approximately 23.7% and 44.9%, respectively, achieving overall accuracy comparable to the CrIS-EDR product. Under cloudy conditions, both models using CrIS data alone exhibited accuracy similar to CrIS-EDR; however, the inclusion of GNSS-PWV data led to reductions in RMSE of approximately 28.4% and 37.8% for the Transformer and RF models, respectively, relative to retrievals based solely on CrIS data, with the BIAS values further improved compared with the CrIS-EDR product. Overall, the joint retrieval using infrared hyperspectral and ground-based GNSS-PWV data significantly enhances the accuracy of specific humidity profile retrievals, showing clear advantages over the CrIS-EDR product, particularly under cloudy conditions."

 To address the issues of low accuracy and limited spatial resolution in traditional single data source precipitable water vapor (PWV) predictions, based on the strong spatiotemporal characteristics of PWV, we constructed a high-accuracy, high-spatial-resolution continuous real-time PWV prediction model based on multi-source PWV data fusion. The PWV data include Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) PWV and the fifth generation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ERA5) PWV.

 Dicarboxylic acids (diacids) and related species act as critical molecular tracers for secondary organic aerosols (SOA), which significantly influence atmospheric chemical processes and climate forcing. Nevertheless, the origins and formation pathways of these compounds remain inadequately characterized, introducing considerable uncertainties in evaluating the climate effects of SOA. This study investigates the seasonal variability in molecular distribution and stable carbon isotopic compositions (δ13C) of diacid homologs in PM2.5 to elucidate their origins and formation mechanisms in an urban Liaocheng, China. Elevated concentrations of diacid homologs were observed in winter (1469 ± 1325 ng m−3) than in summer (884 ± 343 ng m−3), predominantly attributed to significant contributions from fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning for heating during cold months. In contrast, summertime aerosols exhibited stronger photochemical aging, evidenced by enriched δ13C values of oxalic acid (C2) and increased ratios of C2/succinic acid (C4), malonic acid (C3)/C4, and C2/diacids. Correlation analyses and positive matrix factorization identified gaseous photochemical oxidation (52.4 %) as the dominant formation pathway driven by O3 and solar radiation in summer, while aqueous oxidation (57.6 %) modulated by relative humidity, aerosol acidity, and liquid water content prevailed in winter. A consistent decrease in δ13C values with increasing carbon chain length aligns with kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) during oxidative processes. Inter-site comparisons reveal that urban sites exhibit the most depleted δ13C values in C2 due to dominant anthropogenic emissions, whereas less depleted values at rural and background sites reflect greater biogenic contributions and extensive photochemical aging. Strong correlations between δ13C values of C2 and the C2/diacids ratio (R2 ≥ 0.55) further support the use of δ13C as an effective proxy for organic aerosol aging. These findings underscore the necessity of adopting a balanced and coordinated approach to air pollution control, which must address both primary emissions and secondary formation processes, while considering the interplay with meteorological factors."

 On April 16th, 2024, Dubai experienced a record-breaking extreme rainfall event, with a total precipitation of 132.21 mm, accounting for 95.83 % of the month's total rainfall. The precipitation rate on April 16th was 128.86 mm/day, reflecting the abruptness of this event. This study defined the “Chimney effect” with this heavy rainfall. Using moisture budget analysis, the primary driver for this event was the anomalous vertical convection (7.46 mm/day), which was mainly contributed by the anomalous updrafts (exceeding 1.5 Pa/s). Conversely, the climatological zonal convection (−7.07 mm/day) had the largest inhibiting impact on rainfall. The anomalous signal of atmospheric circulation was 8 days earlier than this heavy rainfall, which was initially identified on April 8th with anomalous westerlies to the south of Dubai. This consistent phenomenon was accompanied by an anomalous northerlies on the 14th, resulting in a low pressure center over Dubai on the 16th, with a low-level convergence and upper-level divergence character. The increase of sea surface temperature in the northern Indian Ocean facilitated the transfer of moisture to Dubai. The presence of robust updrafts from 1000 to 200 hPa over Dubai on the 16th, shaped by an intense low pressure system, resulted in the lifting and cooling of warm and humid air from the Indian Ocean, culminating in heavy rainfall. While this event highlights the impact of climate change on arid regions, the study emphasizes the need to improve the resilience of infrastructure, particularly in light of the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events."

 Snow is an important water resource in high-altitude cold regions and snow drought (SD), characterized by a lack of on-ground snow, severely impacts agriculture, ecology, and socioeconomic wellbeing in such regions. However, systematic research on SD on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) remains lacking. In this study, we employed a high-dimensional vine copula-based method and combined this with various standardized indices to reveal the spatiotemporal variations of SD and the ways in which it propagates to soil-moisture drought (SMD) on the TP. We found that warm and dry snow drought (WDSD) accounted for the highest proportion (40.29 %) of SD, while warm snow drought (WSD) accounted for the lowest proportion (19.04 %). Annual precipitation and winter precipitation regulated the spatial distribution of SD characteristics. Under the known background of climate change on the TP, we discovered a significant decreasing trend in dry snow drought (DSD) along with increasing trends in WSD and WDSD; an overall rise in air temperature on the TP was responsible for these trends. The average propagation time (PT) from SD to SMD varied from 3.6 to 5.2 months depending on the type of SD, with relatively complex factors regulating the spatial distribution of PT. Climate change on the TP has intensified the DSD propagation process and weakened the WSD propagation process. Our findings have important implications for mitigating the impacts of drought under future global warming scenarios."

 To understand the spatiotemporal difference of atmospheric brown carbon (BrC) in the North China Plain (NCP), the chemical composition of PM2.5 and optical properties in Beijing during winter and summer of 2023 were investigated, along with parallel measurements at a mountainous site (Xinglong, ∼1000 m, a.s.l.). Although the light-absorption of BrC (Abs365) in Xinglong was comparable to that in Beijing, its light-absorptivity (MAE365) was much stronger; And both parameters exhibited higher values in winter than in summer at each site. Notably, the light absorption of BrC relative to black carbon aloft was 1.7-fold of that at the surface during the whole campaign, indicating an enhanced role of BrC in aerosol absorption in upper boundary layer. The source apportionment identified that biomass burning was the predominant source for the BrC at both sites (31 % ∼ 39 %), yet the fractional contribution of secondary formation aloft (34 %) was moderately enhanced by ∼4 % relative to that at the surface. As the important BrC chromophores, the nitrated aromatic compounds (NACs) in Xinglong were more abundant relative to these in Beijing, especially during wintertime. Among the detected NACs, 4-nitrophenol and 4-nitrocatechol were the most abundant species at the surface, while the mass fraction of 5-nitroguaiacol significantly enhanced aloft, even comparable to 4NP in summer. Additionally, aqueous chemistry could be an important pathway to NACs formation, even accounting for 80 % of the total NACs in a typical haze episode. Our findings provide more insight into the spatiotemporal variability in the physicochemical properties of BrC in NCP, which will facilitate the improvement of the model to accurately quantify its climatic impacts."

 Water stress is a major environmental factor limiting vegetation productivity, however, large interactions between atmospheric and soil dryness still hinder a complete understanding of the main cause of the widespread drought-related decreased vegetation productivity. In this study, we investigated inter-annual changes in gross primary productivity during 1982 to 1998 and 1998 to 2018 using two independent remote sensing products. We also analyzed the impacts of temperature, soil moisture, and vapor pressure deficit on gross primary productivity trends during 1982 to 1998 and 1998 to 2018 to explore the causes of gross primary productivity declines during recent decades.

In the Northern Hemisphere, whilst increasing vapor pressure deficit plays a dominant role in weakening the gross primary productivity trend from 1998 to 2018, changing soil moisture and temperature also influences the trends as identified in different regional responses.

Rain and freezing rain are featured with a three-phase layer: (1) an ice-phase layer where snow particles transform partially into graupel particles (∼55 %); (2) a melting layer where most particles melt into drizzle/rain particles (∼90 %), with notable bright-band features; (3) a liquid-phase layer where radar reflectivity increase but Doppler velocity decrease, due to collision-coalescence processes.

By combining pedogeochemical and multi-isotopic analyses with ultrahigh-resolution molecular and bioenergetic characterization of Mollisols in NE China, this research presents new evidence that unique cold region soil-forming environments are central to the coenrichment of OM and Se. While Mollisol OM originated from both C3 (e.g., meadow) and C4 (e.g., corn) plants, paleoclimate and redox shifts emerged as critical factors driving variations in the compositional and structural characteristics of OM, and substantial differences with the underlying parent material. The abundance of moderately energetic organic compounds (e.g., lipids and proteins) in Mollisols accounts for Se retention as organic-bound species. Under agricultural land use, the loss of OM and Se was accompanied by increasing proportions of microbial metabolites and fulvic acid-bound and hydrophilic Se species.

We investigate the persistence of atmospheric nanoparticles in the NOC size range indoors during scented candle combustion in a residential test house. Our results indicate that atmospheric nanoparticles in the 1–6 nm size range dominate indoor particle concentrations, constituting up to ∼65% of total particles. The fate of these nanoparticles in indoor air is mainly governed by their apparent emission rates and the coagulation scavenging potential of the indoor atmosphere, parametrized through the net coagulation sink and aerosol Fuchs surface area. To better characterize this, we introduce a dimensionless parameter (S)─the ratio of the max-normalized net coagulation sink to the apparent emission rate─which effectively describes particle survival at specific sizes and offers a critical and previously lacking metric to evaluate nanoparticle persistence versus suppression in indoor environments. When this ratio exceeds 10, the concentration of 1–6 nm nanoparticles is suppressed by more than a hundred-fold. However, since this ratio typically remains <10 for most 1–6 nm nanoparticles, they persist at high concentrations, posing significant health risks due to their potential to penetrate deeply into the human respiratory tract, quantified through another novel parameter─the respiratory survival probability."

Because NH3 is a key precursor of SNA formation, accurate NH3 emission data are essential for reliable SNA simulations. This study improves NH3 emission inventories in East Asia by integrating the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) and the Cross-Track Infrared Sounder (CrIS), with extensive evaluation against ground-based and aircraft observations from the Korea-United States Air Quality (KORUS-AQ) campaign. Iterative linear inversion of NH3 emissions using WRF-Chem markedly enhances simulations of nitrate and ammonium, in agreement with both the aircraft and surface measurements. The absolute biases of nitrate and ammonium were reduced from 89.7 and 50.1% to 13.6 and 0.6%, respectively, compared to the aircraft observations over Seoul. However, uncertainties in nocturnal NH3 emissions remain potential sources of nighttime biases in nitrate and ammonium. Overall, the results indicate that nitrate aerosol in most of East Asia is sensitive to NH3 emission changes. To advance our understanding of SNA formation and support effective aerosol mitigation policies, improved characterization of the diurnal cycle of NH3 emissions through ground-based monitoring and high-resolution geostationary satellite observations is urgently needed."

Aircraft sewage, aggregating microbial material from global travelers, offers a unique surveillance opportunity for AMR at international entry points. However, specific AMR elements detected in aircraft sewage and how their relative abundance and transcriptional activity may be associated with flight characteristics such as flight duration or departure country remain unclear. This study analyzed 130 sewage samples from international flights arriving in Saudi Arabia across 27 countries. Metagenomic analyses revealed distinct AMR profiles in aircraft sewage compared to local municipal sewage, including elevated relative abundances of Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus. Aircraft sewage harbored 51 antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) that were not detected in local municipal sewage, predominantly carbapenem-resistant genes (e.g., blaNDM, blaVIM). Additionally, geographical origin of flights shaped AMR composition with lower ARG diversity observed from African-origin flights, whereas Asian and American flights exhibited enriched ARG profiles. Flight length affected AMR expression with long-haul flights (>3500 km) associated with elevated transcription levels. These findings demonstrated how international air travel facilitates the dissemination of AMR across regions and provided actionable insights to devise aircraft sewage surveillance strategies."

To further advance the impact assessment and remediation technology for PFAS pollution, new approaches for identifying emerging PFAS are necessary. While 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has unique advantages in analyzing PFAS in complex sample matrices, the spectra interpretation remains challenging due to the limited reference data. Herein, we address this significant knowledge gap using machine learning (ML) to predict 19F NMR chemical shifts of PFAS. We curated a data set comprising 3616 chemical shifts from 647 fluorinated compounds, explored various atomic feature descriptors for modeling, and evaluated multiple ML algorithms. The feed-forward neural network (FFNN) model performed the best, achieving a mean absolute error of 2.40 ppm on the test data set. Notably, 49% of predictions had errors <1.0 ppm and 86% < 5.0 ppm. The model predicted the chemical shifts of novel F atom configurations with up to 90% lower average errors than a database-driven method. We also developed a confidence level system (1–6) to provide error estimation for each prediction and guide future data set expansion toward low-confidence structures. The utility of the model was further validated through (i) prediction of NMR spectra of novel PFAS compounds, (ii) assistance in peak assignment, and (iii) structural clarification of an unknown PFAS in a real wastewater sample.

However, the role of sea surface temperature (SST) in modulating this emission remains unclear. This study systematically investigates the impact of SST on PFAAs enrichment in SSA using laboratory experiments and global emission modeling. Results show that higher SST can significantly promote the enrichment of PFAAs in SSA (particularly in submicrometer SSA), due to increased bubble collision efficiency and surface-active behavior of PFAAs. The enrichment factors (EFs) at 25 °C were 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than those at 4 °C, with a stronger SST dependence for longer-chain PFAAs. When considering SST effects, the estimated global emission fluxes of PFOA and PFOS are approximately 3.1 and 2.7 times the previously calculated values, respectively. These findings highlight SST as a critical regulator of PFAAs sea–air transfer, emphasizing the need to integrate temperature-dependent enrichment mechanisms into global models for accurate assessment of atmospheric PFAAs transport and environmental impact."

It is commonly quantified as “wet‐bulb temperature.” Extreme moist heat acts as an upper limit to human survivability. In the tropics, maximum moist heat in models is constrained via convective stability by the weak temperature gradient approximation combined with entraining quasi‐equilibrium dynamics. We examine how observed monthly maximum moist heat varies with atmospheric instability and dryness in comparison to reanalysis. In observations, extreme moist heat increases with lower‐tropospheric saturation deficit in convecting regions as expected from theory. However, weather stations show higher moist heat than reanalysis. We hypothesize that a combination of poor representation of convection sensitivity to lower tropospheric dryness and breakdown of quasi‐equilibrium on small scales causes the extremes in weather stations to be underpredicted by entraining quasi‐equilibrium dynamics calculated from reanalysis statistics. Allowing for small, positive instability better represents extremes."

The reduction of CGT amplitude is reflected in decrease of Rossby wave source (RWS) anomalies, with upstream signal located at jet entrance over eastern Mediterranean. The weakening of RWS is resulted from decreased Mediterranean circulation anomalies. The weakened CGT further alters the pattern of associated heatwave events.

In this study, a minimization technique and a data assimilation method are first applied to reduce the impact of initial errors on the uncertainties in the ET simulation over the TP. Second, the conditional nonlinear optimal parameter perturbation ensemble prediction (CNOP‐PEP) method is employed to evaluate the simulation and forecast performances with imperfect model physical parameters based on the reduction of impact of initial errors. The main features are the combined contribution for ensemble prediction of ET over the TP through the perturbed parameter and the optimization and assimilation of the initial conditions. The numerical results show that the minimization technique and the data assimilation method are useful for reducing uncertainties in ET over the TP due to errors of initial values. Moreover, the ensemble prediction of ET over the TP with assimilated initial conditions is better than that without assimilated initial conditions using the CNOP‐PEP method. Moreover, the ensemble prediction of ET over the TP using the CNOP‐PEP method (17.3%) is better than that using traditional methods, such as the one‐at‐a‐time (OAT) method (2.0%) and the stochastically perturbed parametrization (SPP) method (10.6%) with and without assimilated initial conditions.

 The unavoidable presence of clouds and their shadows in optical satellite imagery hinders the true spectral response of the Earth’s underlying surface. Accurate cloud and cloud shadow detection is therefore a crucial preprocessing step for optical satellite images and any downstream analysis. Various methods have been developed to address this critical task and can be broadly categorized into physical rule-based methods and learning based methods. In recent years, machine learning based methods, particularly deep learning frameworks, have proven to outperform physical rule-based models. However, these approaches are mostly fully supervised and require a large amount of pixel-level annotations whose acquisition is costly and time consuming. In this work, we propose to address cloud and cloud shadow detection in optical satellite images using self-supervised representation learning, a machine learning paradigm that focuses on extracting relevant representations from unlabeled data, which can then be used as an effective starting point to fine-tune models with few labeled data in a supervised fashion. These approaches have been shown to perform competitively with fully supervised methods without the requirement of large annotation datasets. Specifically, we assessed two self-supervised representation learning methods that use different philosophies about self-supervision: Momentum Contrast (MoCo), based on contrastive learning and DeepCluster, based on clustering. Using two publicly available Sentinel-2 cloud datasets, namely WHUS2–CD+ and CloudSEN12, we show that MoCo and DeepCluster, trained with only 25 % of the annotated data, can perform better than physical rule-based methods such as FMask and Sen2Cor, weakly supervised methods and even several fully supervised methods. These results highlight the strong applicability of self-supervised representation learning methods to the task of cloud and cloud shadow detection with self-supervised pretraining leading to fine-tuned models that outperform industry standards and achieve near state-of-the-art performance with a fraction of the data."

 The retrieval of sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) from hyperspectral imagery requires accurate atmospheric compensation to correctly disentangle its small contribution to the at-sensor radiance from other confounding factors. In spectral fitting SIF retrieval approaches this compensation is estimated in a joint optimization of free variables when fitting the measured at-sensor signal. Due to the computational complexity of Radiative Transfer Models (RTMs) that satisfy the level of precision required for accurate SIF retrieval, fully joint estimations are practically unachievable with exact physical simulation. We present in this contribution an emulator-based spectral fitting method neural network (EmSFMNN) approach integrating RTM emulation and self-supervised training for computationally efficient and accurate SIF retrieval in the O2-A absorption band of HyPlant imagery. In a validation study with in-situ top-of-canopy SIF measurements we find improved performance over traditional retrieval methods. Furthermore, we show that the model predicts plausible SIF emission in topographically variable terrain without scene-specific adaptations. Since EmSFMNN can be adapted to hyperspectral imaging sensors in a straightforward fashion, it may prove to be an interesting SIF retrieval method for other sensors on airborne and spaceborne platforms."

 Drought has emerged as a critical constraint on sustainable agricultural development, particularly in water-scarce agroecosystems where multiscale hydrological stresses—such as rainfall deficits, soil moisture depletion, and groundwater exhaustion—interact to undermine crop productivity stability. However, current remote sensing frameworks lack the capacity to isolate and quantify the independent impacts of groundwater drought on crop photosynthesis and yield, leading to long-standing underestimation of deep-layer hydrological stress, especially in groundwater-dependent regions. To address this gap, we have proposed a dynamic monitoring framework based on solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) to assess the photosynthetic response characteristics of winter wheat across the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain under precipitation, surface moisture, and groundwater anomalies. This framework integrates dynamic time warping (DTW) for interannual phenological alignment and constructs a quantile-based dynamic baseline library that overcomes the limitations of traditional normality-based anomaly metrics. On this basis, we have developed a novel photosynthetic response anomaly index (PRAI) to characterize the spatiotemporal evolution of drought-induced photosynthetic stress. Results reveal that groundwater anomalies induce a significantly lagged crop response (mean lag ≈ +2.1 months, p < 0.01) and exert stronger influence on photosynthetic dynamics than soil surface moisture or rainfall. PRAI exhibits more concentrated and persistent negative anomalies during groundwater drought years, correlating more strongly with yield loss (R2 = 0.53) than during meteorological drought years (R2 = 0.30). Cross-validation using evapotranspiration (ET) and vegetation optical depth (VOD) further confirms PRAI reliability in capturing physiological stress. The proposed SIF-based dynamic monitoring framework not only deepens the understanding of crop eco-physiological response mechanisms to multiscale water stress, but also provides critical scientific support and methodological innovations for regional scale precision agriculture, crop model optimization, and sustainable water resource management."

 Ultrafine particles (UFPs, ≤100 nm) are a major component of urban air pollution, influenced by source emission rates (of UFPs and precursors) and meteorological conditions, both of which vary over time. This study evaluates the effect of dispersion normalisation on UFP source apportionment and long-term trends in the urban background of Barcelona (NE Spain) over a 12-year period (2013–2024). Hourly particle number size distributions (PNSD) were normalised using the ventilation coefficient (VC), derived from boundary layer height and wind speed, and analysed with positive matrix factorisation (PMF) for cold (October–March) and warm (April–September) seasons. Seven factors were identified, with road traffic as the dominant contributor. Dispersion corrected (DC) traffic contributions averaged 57 % of particle number concentrations (PNCs), compared with 64 % in the uncorrected (UC) analysis, indicating overestimation of local sources when dispersion is not considered. Photonucleation and Nucleation growth showed higher DC contributions (37 % compared with 31 % for UC), consistent with midday occurrence under favourable mixing conditions. Trend analysis revealed significant decreases in PNCs (−4.4 % yr−1), strongest in the Aitken mode, likely linked to reduced traffic emissions following EURO 5/6 regulations, the introduction of diesel particulate filters (DPFs), and the implementation of Barcelona's low emission zone (LEZ). Traffic-related factors declined by −4.6 % yr−1, with the largest decrease in the diesel-related source. Nucleation growth and Regional-1 also declined, while Photonucleation and Regional-2 showed no clear trend. These findings highlight the value of dispersion normalisation in source apportionment and provide strong evidence of the effectiveness of emission control-policies in reducing traffic-related UFPs."

 Tropical easterly waves (TEWs) play a key role in rainfall variability and act as precursors to tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic. However, the origin of TEW-related precipitation remains insufficiently explored. This study presents a 39-year (1985–2023) climatology of TEWs using a curvature vorticity-based tracking method applied to a downscaled ERA5 dataset, combined with a Lagrangian moisture source analysis. An average of 41 ± 5 TEWs per year is identified, with a pronounced peak during July–September. TEWs propagate westward at approximately 8 m/s, with the highest activity across the main development region of tropical cyclones. TEWs account for 1–7 % of annual rainfall across the basin, with peaks spatially coinciding with areas of highest wave activity. Moisture source diagnostics reveal three distinct TEW regimes. Near the African coast, moisture is primarily derived from the eastern tropical Atlantic and continental Africa, whereas waves in the central Atlantic and Caribbean region increasingly rely on long-distance zonal transport from the eastern and central tropical Atlantic, consistent with the wave lifecycle. The analysis also reveals the trade and easterly winds as the primary moisture transport mechanisms, while area-average moisture uptake and associated precipitation show no statistically significant positive long-term trends. Meanwhile, the mean water vapour residence time for TEW-related precipitation is about 3.6 days, slightly longer than for tropical cyclones. This study extends previous climatologies and contributes to enhancing the understanding of TEW-related hydroclimate processes in the tropical North Atlantic."

 This study assesses the contributions of extreme and non-extreme rainfall events to seasonal precipitation over Northwest India (NWI) and examines the underlying dynamical mechanisms. Our analysis reveals a notable increase (10 %) in overall seasonal rainfall of NWI during 2000–2023 period relative to 1971–2000. In addition, we also found that extreme rainfall events (EREs; R90s) have contributed more than 75 % of the total seasonal rainfall over majority of NWI, with some regions (Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Gujarat) extending the contributions beyond 90 %. Our comprehensive analysis reveals large scale atmospheric circulation as the key driver during EREs. Specifically, the Rossby wave induced trough elongation from Europe played a dominant role and is modulated by the negative configuration of the East Asian Polar and Subtropical Jet streams, which eventually facilitated downstream propagation. The resulting wave pattern featured an amplified barotropic ridge over the North Pacific, a distorted positive phase of the Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern, and a ridge (trough) over North Atlantic Ocean and Europe. This European trough slowly descended from upper to lower levels, elongated and merged with the pre-existing low over NWI. Such synoptic configuration enhanced the moisture transport from the equatorial Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea into NWI by strengthening the low-level jet and sustaining deep convection, leading to rainfall extremes.

Exhaled breath analysis, as a real–time and sensitive human biomonitoring technique, is causing significant concerns. This study aims to analyze and assess volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in human exhaled breath under ambient ozone (O3) exposure. A comprehensive correlation analysis involving 288 VOCs are identified in the exhaled breath of healthy adults (n = 1130), uncovering 12 VOCs including methanol, propyne, and 1–butene etc. that show strong exposed correlations with ambient O3 levels. Nonlinear modeling indicated the dose–response commencing at O3 concentrations as low as 58 μg/m3. Moreover, the presence of PM2.5 significantly exacerbates the effect of O3 on the filtered 12 VOCs. The most pronounced interplay is observed at 140 μg/m3 for O3 and 150 μg/m3 for PM2.5. Finally, an in-vivo study using rats validates the result, with all of the 12 exhaled breath biomarkers exhibit obvious differences (O3 exposure group vs control group). This work demonstrates direct evidence that ambient O3 pollution impacts on human exhaled VOCs, and also offers valuable insights for establishing O3 exposure thresholds."

To address this, a size-probability distribution method is proposed that integrates empirical size distribution characteristics with volume-density models. The optimal configuration was identified by combining a conditional fragmentation distribution (CFD)-based size model with suitable volume approximations and evaluating it against measured mass from balance and mass spectrometry data. This method outperformed coefficient-based conversion approaches and achieved comparable accuracy with the results of direct volume-density calculations. When applied to empirical MP data from the Yangtze River, the method estimated annual mass fluxes ranging from 1950.00 to 12,655.58 tons, with a mean of 6895.90 ± 3763.24 tons. Overall, the proposed method provides a reliable and efficient means of estimating MP mass from particle counts data, yielding accurate, comparable mass estimates across different size classes."

We use CrIS satellite observations and GEOS-Chem simulations to identify a persistent hotspot of free tropospheric PAN over the Sichuan Basin (SCB) in China during winter. The basin topography promotes the initial vertical lifting, while the subsequent temperature inversion layer in the free troposphere (FT) traps the lifted NOx and NMVOCs, thereby facilitating PAN formation. Budget analysis for a 3-D box representing the SCB FT (825–215 hPa) shows that photochemical production accounts for 73% of PAN formation, while vertical transport from below contributes 27%. Dominant photochemical PAN formation stems from stagnant air masses enabling sufficient oxidation of precursors and low winter temperatures prolonging PAN lifetime. Horizontal transport dominates PAN removal (50%), suggesting the SCB as a winter source of PAN and NOx to downwind regions. This study highlights that meteorology and terrain drive severe winter PAN pollution in the SCB."

 Atmospheric mercury depletion events (AMDEs) are a unique phenomenon in polar mercury cycling, involving intense atmospheric mercury oxidation and deposition that amplify marine mercury sinks. The Southern Ocean, a critical hotspot for environmental mercury exposure, exhibits AMDEs whose characteristics and distribution patterns remain unclear. This study presents the observational dataset of atmospheric gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) across the circum-Antarctic Southern Ocean. We observed pronounced summertime AMDEs that drove high spatial heterogeneity in circumpolar GEM distribution. By combining Generalized Additive Models (GAM) simulations with multi-platform observational evidence, we demonstrate that the Antarctic continental outflow largely shapes the circumpolar distribution of summertime AMDEs, concentrating these events within the convergence zones of katabatic winds. This work highlights the critical role of land-sea coupling effects in Antarctic atmospheric chemistry, and underscores the need to systematically assess the implications of these processes for mercury bioavailability across Southern Ocean ecosystems.

 The Asian-Australian monsoon system (A-AuMS) is the most typical cross-equatorial monsoon system and thus inter-hemispheric comparison is essential to explore its dynamics. Although the evolution of Holocene Asian summer monsoon has been extensively studied, changes in Australian summer monsoon (AuSM) is less investigated due to the lack of identified high-resolution paleoclimate records. Here we obtain a 13.5 kyr AuSM record from lacustrine sediments in northeastern Australia. It suggests that the weakening of the AuSM during the early to middle Holocene was regulated by Northern Hemisphere high-latitude ice volume, while the strengthening of the AuSM during the middle to late Holocene was mainly controlled by increased Southern Hemisphere summer insolation. The combination of Asian and Australian monsoon records show that the coupling evolution of A-AuMS was dominated by the temperature gradient between two hemispheres, which involve the changes of the AMOC, Northern Hemisphere ice volumes and solar insolation in both hemispheres. The reconstructed Holocene Australian summer monsoon in this study, together with the Asian monsoon records, show that the coupling evolution of Holocene Asian-Australian monsoon was dominated by the thermal imbalance between two hemispheres."

 Variations in the winter India-Burma trough (IBT) are associated with local cyclonic anomalies over the Bay of Bengal and modulated by mid-latitude teleconnections. However, spring IBT variability remains poorly understand, despite trough-base precipitation being substantially greater than in winter. Here, we identify a reversal in the spring IBT-Tibetan Plateau snow cover (TPS) relationship around the year 2000. This shift corresponds to eastward displacement of the trough-base before 2000, followed by a retreat toward the Bay of Bengal. Snow-perturbation experiments and moist potential vorticity diagnostics show that during 1979–1999, high TPS enhances atmospheric disturbances ahead of the trough and weakens them near its base. This process hence triggers an eastward displacement of the IBT. During 2000–2020, high TPS exerts largely opposite effects. Furthermore, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) modulates this IBT-TPS linkage reversal. In the coming decades, a projected shift to a positive PDO phase is expected to promote IBT eastward displacement, enhancing spring precipitation in East Asia while increasing drought risk over the Indochina Peninsula. Our results hence provide a basis for improving seasonal projections and assessing climate risks across monsoon Asia."

 Extreme aerosol pollution events impact climate, air quality, and human health, yet their global synchronization patterns and driving mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we construct event synchronization networks to examine both near-field transmission and teleconnection of extreme aerosol pollution events. We find a marked increase in asymmetry within near-field event synchronization networks over recent decades, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, driven by intensified source-sink relationships in high-emission regions. Teleconnection patterns are shaped by Rossby wave activity, making high-aerosol regions increasingly sensitive to atmospheric variability and more susceptible to synchronized extreme events. We find a shift in high teleconnection activity from North America and Europe to Central and East Asia. While major volcanic eruptions can temporarily boost global aerosol synchronization, long-term trends are dominated by anthropogenic forcing. These findings reveal clear anthropogenic fingerprints of extreme aerosol pollution events at a planetary scale, linking regions of intense industrial activity to distant pollution impacts.

 Coastal river deltas are highly dynamic regions with hydrological processes that vary on hourly, daily, and seasonal timescales. Soil formation in deltas relies on the balance between mineral sediment deposition, erosion, and organic matter production, which are intricately controlled by vegetation and hydrodynamic conditions. The spatial complexity and rapid variations in flow, particularly due to tides, present a major challenge to spaceborne remote sensing achieving the required spatial resolution and temporal sampling. Here, we present an airborne remote sensing and in situ framework that measures parameters that are critical to calibrate and validate hydrodynamic, sediment transport, morphodynamic, and ecogeomorphic models. We discuss the measurements and models within the context of the NASA Earth Venture-Suborbital Delta-X mission, which implemented the framework in two deltaic regions of the Mississippi River Delta with contrasting hydrological regimes, namely the Atchafalaya (i.e., active, river-dominated) and Terrebonne (inactive, river-abandoned) basins that are undergoing land gain and land loss, respectively. The Delta-X framework uses two airborne radar instruments to monitor hydrodynamic processes, measuring water surface level and slope within channels, and tide-induced water level change within wetlands. In addition, an airborne imaging spectrometer provides estimates of suspended sediment concentrations in open water as well as vegetation type and aboveground biomass. We also discuss how the data are used to calibrate and validate the models that estimate sediment deposition and organic soil production, which build land to offset subsidence and sea level rise."

This was the first fusion of Fire radiation power (FRP) data from the Fengyun-4A geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites. We further proposed 5 filtering rules based on FRP characteristics. COBBEI could fill data gaps in China's open biomass burning emission inventories and provide key data for air quality models, environmental policy development, and fire emergency response. 
 Pollutants released from open biomass burning (OBB) considerably impact air quality, human health, and ecosystems. Only a few studies have used geostationary satellites to monitor OBB emissions in China. Therefore, we construct the China Open Biomass Burning Emissions Inventory (COBBEI) from 2020 to 2023. This dataset included eight pollutants with a temporal resolution of 1 hour and a spatial resolution of 2 km. The COBBEI integrated multi-satellite data, including MODIS, NPP, and Fengyun-4A (FY-4A). The Fire Radiation Power (FRP) data were reconstructed to the FRP cycle, and we integrated the curves to obtain the hourly biomass burned. We also developed five filtering rules based on FRP, considering fire point frequency, radiation values, timing, and variation. These rules were applied to correct the land cover maps, and their validity was verified. The annual average emissions of CO2, CO, CH4, NOx, SO2, PM2.5, K, and LG were 46530, 2262, 132, 82, 25, 247, 11, and 12 Gg, respectively. The spatial distribution characteristics of all eight pollutants were generally consistent. Northeast China served as a major center of pollutant emissions. Different types of fires exhibited various spatial distributions. By validating the method and comparing it with other databases, it was confirmed that COBBEI reduced uncertainty in the OBB emission inventory by providing more information on fire points and effectively screening out fires that were not from OBB. The dataset could offer essential data for air quality modeling, environmental policy development, and fire emergency response strategies.

Plastics, recognized as reservoirs of numerous chemical additives with documented but rarely investigated PFAS usage, represent a potential unidentified source. Here, 105 plastic products representing 11 types of polymers were analyzed, with 20 PFAS from 6 classes identified (confidence levels of 3 or better). Polycarbonate (PC) exhibited the highest average total PFAS concentration (713 ng/g), primarily dominated by PFBS (97%), reaching up to 6130 ng/g. PFBS, commonly co-occurred with a monohydrogen-substituted PFBS (H-PFBS), particularly enriched in PC components from electronic products, indicating intentional use as flame retardants. Consistent PFBS to H-PFBS peak area ratios observed in PC samples (∼4%) and industrial PFBS products (0.07−3%), along with patent records, suggest H-PFBS as a manufacturing impurity. Simulated leaching experiments in a realistic scenario showed rapid migration of PFBS and H-PFBS into both freshwater and seawater, achieving equilibrium releases up to 39% within 14 days. Annual PFBS emissions from PC plastics to landfill leachates in China were estimated at ∼40 kg, contributing ∼10% of the total landfill-derived PFAS flux. These findings identify that PC plastics may represent a previously underrecognized contributor to PFBS contamination in landfill leachates, emphasizing the urgent need for safer plastic additives and enhanced waste management."

To address this, we developed GP-BT, a Gaussian Process Bayesian Tuning framework that systematically optimizes kernel selection and hyperparameters by directly minimizing cross-validation loss, explicitly prioritizing generalization over training set fitting. Comprehensive evaluation across three environmental data sets demonstrated GP-BT’s superior robustness compared to conventional algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost) and standard GP models. The GP-BT’s practical value was confirmed through 52 independent laboratory experiments, achieving lower prediction errors on unseen conditions. The method’s conservative learning strategy─avoiding aggressive fitting of sparse, noisy data points─proved crucial for reliable real-world performance. Applied to combined sewer overflows treatment optimization, GP-BT uncovered experimental conditions achieving 98% removal efficiency, compared to 89% predicted by the overfitted Random Forest model. Experimental validation confirmed these predictions, revealing substantial process potential masked by traditional modeling approaches. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis showed that GP-BT’s interpretations better aligned with established physicochemical mechanisms, properly emphasizing reagent importance over less controllable factors. Beyond specific applications, this work provides environmental researchers with a ready-to-use, rigorously validated framework for extracting reliable insights from costly, small-scale experimental data sets.

Oscillations in solar wind dynamic pressure excite field line resonances in the magnetosphere.

Most RHi remain below 120%, suggesting that these clouds form predominantly by heterogeneous ice nucleation. In rare cases, RHi > 140% enables homogeneous nucleation. Thicker cirrus show higher backscatter, indicating numerous particles that likely nucleated homogeneously in deep convection.

The other reason is TCs' less tornado‐conducive environments in China. TC environments in China are more dynamically favorable but less thermodynamically conducive to tornadogenesis relative to the U.S. The composite impact is that the regions with the most favorable thermodynamic and kinematic conditions mismatch in China, with the former in the southwest quadrant and the latter in the northeast quadrant of TCs, whereas they overlap in the northeast quadrant in the U.S. and thus lead to a larger composite parameter.

The global‐mean darkening is primarily driven by clouds, while the global‐mean atmospheric clear‐sky signal is near zero due to offsetting trends in the two hemispheres. Northern Hemisphere clear‐sky darkening is dominated by reduced anthropogenic aerosol emissions over population centers. The Southern Hemisphere (SH), in contrast, exhibits an unexpected widespread atmospheric clear‐sky brightening, particularly over the remote Southern Ocean (SO). We ascribe this brightening to an increase in aerosol optical depth (AOD). Based on observed correlations between monthly‐mean wind speed and AOD over the SO, we conclude the trends in AOD come from enhanced wind‐driven sea spray aerosol emissions driven by increasing near‐surface winds. We discuss the implications of SO brightening for deviations away from the observed hemispheric albedo symmetry and more generally as a potential negative Earth system feedback."

We find for a given effective forcing magnitude, higher‐altitude forcing causes a smaller global warming, owing to more negative cloud feedback. We present novel evidence relating this altitude dependence to sea‐surface temperature patterns and tropospheric static stability. The imposed instantaneous forcings are horizontally uniform, but higher‐altitude forcings more effectively suppress convection in the tropical warm pool, producing a more positive effective (adjusted) surface forcing in that region. This gives rise, during the subsequent climate change, to greater warming contrast between the warm pool and rest of the globe, and hence to increase in low cloud amount. Our results show that to achieve accurate climate projections under anthropogenic forcings, it is important to correctly represent the vertical structures of the applied radiative forcing."

Here, we show laboratory experiments and quantum calculations, which demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, that highly oxygenated organosulfates (OOS) formed in the gas phase contribute to aerosol nucleation independently of sulfuric acid and oxygenated organic molecules. More than 200 different gas‐phase OOS were detected with the nitrate CI‐APi‐TOF from a mixture of α‐pinene, ozone, and SO2. The gas‐phase OOS concentrations were strongly correlated with sulfuric acid. Quantum chemical modeling simulations showed that OOS forms in the gas phase from α‐pinene diols and SO3 via a barrierless process. Nucleation rates increased much more rapidly with increasing α‐pinene concentrations in the mixed system than in the pure biogenic system, clearly demonstrating that OOS are effective nucleation precursors in mixed biogenic and anthropogenic systems."

This study enhances mechanistic understanding of this coupling by comparing two long‐term simulations (1991–2014) using the new Regional Integrated Earth Model System (RIEMS) with air‐sea coupling and its standalone atmospheric model (WRF). Results show both RIEMS and WRF demonstrate advantages and added values in reproducing summer air temperature (T2mean and T2max) and precipitation compared to the ensemble mean of global climate models (ENS). Meanwhile, RIEMS better reproduces T2mean and T2max compared to WRF, particularly over East China. RIEMS reduces the T2max warm bias in WRF by 0.7°C on average over land. Additionally, RIEMS offers more accurate simulations of surface sensible and latent heat fluxes while WRF overestimates sensible heat flux by nearly 7.0 W m−2 over land. Mechanistic analyses indicate that WRF reproduces less cloud cover and increased incoming shortwave radiation, resulting in higher sensible heat flux and warmer air temperature. The climatological decrease in cloud cover in WRF can be attributed to its warmer air temperature. Meanwhile, WRF simulated less outgoing shortwave radiation and trapped more longwave radiation, leading to warmer surface air temperature. Furthermore, without air‐sea coupling, WRF strengthened water and energy transportation from ocean to land through a stronger southwesterly airflow, which is more conducive to simulating higher surface air temperatures in WRF over a large area. These findings provide mechanistic evidence that regional air‐sea coupling is essential for credible climate simulations and projections over East Asia."

This study investigates the correlation between these aerosols and day‐night (D‐N) temperature changes over India by applying principal component analysis (PCA) in long‐term (2003–2021) satellite observations (MODIS AOD, AIRS D‐N temperature at 850 hPa, MOPITT CO) and MERRA‐2 reanalysis data. Mode analysis for the premonsoon period identifies biomass burning in northeast India as the dominant source of the second mode of AOD, BC AOD, and CO, with strong covariations between BC AOD and AOD (R = 0.90) and between CO and AOD (R > 0.79). PCA of satellite observations shows that long‐term variation of AOD and D‐N temperature at 850 hPa in the second mode is strongly correlated (R = 0.83), highlighting the sensitivity of diurnal temperature variations to light‐absorbing aerosols. This strong relationship is further confirmed with MERRA‐2 reanalysis data. Moreover, high correlations (R > 0.85) between BC AOD and D‐N temperature in the second mode validate the role of biomass burning in driving long‐term diurnal temperature contrast. Reconstruction analysis over northeast India indicates that the BC AOD fraction accounts for approximately 42% of the D‐N temperature variability during the 19‐year study period. These findings not only quantify the critical role of biomass burning aerosols in modulating diurnal temperature variations across the Indian region but also provide satellite observation‐based insights that have the potential to constrain the aerosol radiative effects on the atmospheric temperature profile in climate models."

To estimate their impacts on future SMB, we study Antarctic ARs in an ensemble of 21st‐century simulations of the IPSL‐CM6 model. Although the number of detected ARs continuously increases when using a constant detection threshold based on recent moisture fluxes, it remains stable with an adaptive threshold evolving with the rising background moisture. In addition, ARs penetrate further into Antarctica following a wave‐number 3 pattern. The severity of Antarctic ARs, measured by moisture fluxes, is projected to increase following the moisture content given by the Clausius‐Clapeyron relation. The corresponding SMB impacts all become larger with both increasing snowfall and coastal surface melt and rainfall. However, their overall influence on the SMB is dominated by the increased snow accumulation related to ARs, which is rising by 17% at the scale of the continent. This is much larger than the overall increase in snow accumulation from all events combined, which is 9%, and is more closely related to the rise in total humidity in relation with temperature—that is, linked to the Clausius‐Clapeyron relation."

The typical IHC teleconnection pattern is identified in all cases and reasonable data‐model agreement is shown. The simulated residual mean circulation, parameterized gravity wave (GW) forcing, and resolved planetary and tidal forcing represent intra‐seasonal changes during NH major SSWs, which result in the different behaviors of IHCs. In particular, an anomalous cooling below the high‐latitude summer mesopause is identified in addition to the typical IHC patterns in later subseasons and attributed to the consequences of changes in residual mean circulation and GW forcing due to upwelling effects."

The δ18O values, supported by petrographic analyses, indicate extreme events in the ISM behavior. Our data report a distinctly wet phase between ∼722 and 775 CE, followed by a marked decline in precipitation from ∼775 to 850 CE. Subsequently, a prolonged drought‐like condition prevailed between ∼850 and 890 CE. From ∼890 to 980 CE, the northeastern Himalaya witnessed return of wetter conditions, whereas from ∼1140 to 1250 CE the monsoon was relatively stable, analogous to modern ISM patterns in a non‐El Niño scenario. Multidecadal ISM variability in the MCA appears to have been primarily modulated by solar activity, and consequent latitudinal migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. In contrast, subdecadal ISM variability was closely linked to changes in the El Niño‐Southern Oscillation. The pronounced wet conditions from the eighth to thirteenth centuries are believed to have promoted agricultural expansion and crop diversification across India. However, these climatic conditions may also have influenced patterns of cultural and political change, particularly in the eastern regions of the subcontinent."

Despite the growing recognition of NOCs as key components of atmospheric organic matter, their formation through aqueous‐phase processes and potential environmental impacts have long been underestimated. This review begins by summarizing the major classes of NOC molecules, then synthesizes observational evidence on their formation in the aqueous‐phase, particularly highlighting its critical role in generating nitroaromatic and N‐heterocyclic compounds. Built on the observational evidence, we further discuss the related evaluation of the multi‐faceted environmental impacts arising from the aqueous‐phase NOC formation. The evidence demonstrates that aqueous‐phase NOC chemistry exerts significant influence on atmospheric compositions, contributes up to 90% of brown carbon's radiative effects, enhances oxidative capacity and secondary organic aerosol production, and influences nitrogen speciation in wet deposition. However, most current model assessments exhibit considerable limitations in quantifying these effects, stemming primarily from oversimplified parameterizations of aqueous‐phase chemistry that fail to adequately represent the full complexity of atmospheric multiphase systems. Furthermore, existing observational data sets remain insufficient, severely constraining efforts to optimize model parameters and validate simulation outputs. To address these critical knowledge gaps, we propose an integrated research framework that combines long‐term monitoring of key NOC and various precursors and advanced simulations of aqueous‐phase chemistry at the micrometer‐scale reaction environments, which would constrain the parameterization of future models for the aqueous‐phase chemistry and impacts of NOCs."

Remotely sensed (RS) inundation extents can help identify regions with expected heightened flood‐related health risks, but variations across inundation data sets and their integration into health risk assessments may affect intervention targeting. We examined if the association between census tract (CT) flooding and intestinal infectious disease related emergency department (IID‐ED) visits differed by RS‐based exposure estimation methods. Two Hurricane Harvey Inundation data sets with different spatiotemporal resolutions were used to estimate CT‐level exposure as percent land flooded and percent population flooded, yielding four exposure variables. These were linked to ED visits by residential CT, and the effect estimates for association between IID‐ED visits and flooding were derived. A 10% increase in land flooded was associated with a 6% (1%–10%) higher risk of IID‐ED visits, while percent population flooded was not significantly associated with IID‐ED visits. No statistically significant differences were found in the effect estimates between the inundation data sets or the exposure representation methods. Combining data sets to identify flooded CTs improved model fitness compared to using either alone, indicating a 1.30 (1.16–1.45) times greater risk of IID‐ED visits in flooded CTs compared to non‐flooded CTs. CTs where the data sets disagreed also showed a 25% (8%–10%) higher risk of IID‐ED visits compared to the mutually agreed non‐flooded CTs. Combining remotely sensed inundation data sets of different specifications can address limitations of individual products and improve identifying intervention areas to mitigate flood‐related health risks."

 Space cooling and lighting together consume 25% of global electricity, yet existing daytime radiative coolers are mostly limited to porous planar coatings that block visible light and lack durability. Here, we introduce rheology-optics coupling as a design principle that links polymer viscoelasticity to particle dispersion and optical scattering. Guided by this principle, we develop printable polydimethylsiloxane-zirconium oxide composites that achieve solar reflectance ( ~ 97.3%) and mid-infrared emissivity ( ~ 96.9%) comparable to the best reported values, despite a low filler loading of only ~4.5 vol.%. These scalable coatings provide up to 7.4 oC sub-ambient cooling and cut electricity use by 37% versus commercial paint in pilot-scale testing, while withstanding mechanical, thermal, and environmental stresses. Beyond planar coatings, the rheology-tunable polydimethylsiloxane-zirconium oxide ink enables direct ink writing of daylight-regulating architectures that deliver sub-ambient radiative cooling while admitting diffuse daylight for illumination, reducing both cooling and lighting demand. This work provides a practical and versatile platform for radiative cooling. Daytime radiative cooling materials typically require high filler loading or porosity.

 Tropical cyclones (TCs) have intensified more rapidly in recent decades, with both the frequency and magnitude of rapid intensification (RI) events increasing. While rising sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are widely recognized as the primary driver behind the intensification trend, the contribution of TC-induced cold wakes—localized ocean surface cooling generated by storms—remains poorly quantified. Using 42 years of global data (1982–2023), we identify a robust decline in cold wake size (~7% per decade), driven mainly by enhanced upper ocean stratification. This reduction weakens the oceanic negative feedback on TC intensification and explains about 13% of the observed global trend in intensification rates. The effect extends to RI events and is particularly pronounced in the western Pacific. These findings reveal a previously underappreciated oceanic process that accelerates TC intensification and facilitates more RI events under climate change."

 Data-driven deep learning (DL) models often underestimate the intensity of extreme weather and climate events due to the scarcity of extreme samples in training datasets and the smoothing effects of gradient-based optimization. While ensemble prediction methods based on initial condition (IC) perturbations in traditional numerical models have improved extreme event predictions, they often fail in DL frameworks. This is primarily due to limited error growth characteristics and the implicit regularization in DL models, which dampens the amplification of IC perturbations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel IC perturbation scheme based on orthogonal conditional nonlinear optimal perturbation (O-CNOP), integrated into a DL-based ensemble prediction system. The O-CNOP-derived perturbations are obtained through an iterative selection and optimization process, beginning with candidate samples from model simulations under uniform energy constraints. Perturbations are then selected to maximize forecast error growth, guided by ensemble averaging and convergence criteria. We evaluate this method based on four major El Niño events (1982/83, 1997/98, 2015/16, and 2023/24). Results show significant improvements in DL model predictions when initialized in spring, with over a 30% reduction in prediction error for Niño3.4 sea surface temperature anomalies. This AI-enabled O-CNOP framework offers a robust and generalizable approach to ensemble predicting, potentially improving the prediction skill of DL-based weather and climate models for extreme events."

 Arctic cyclones play a crucial role in regional climate and have important linkages to mid-latitude processes. However, their future changes and driving mechanisms remain uncertain. By applying Lagrangian tracking to CMIP6 models under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, this study projects future Arctic cyclone activity changes and quantitatively investigates the relative contributions of local cyclogenesis and externally migrating systems. By the late 21st century, Arctic cyclone activity is projected to decline, with distinct seasonal and regional differences. Winter reductions stem from weakened local cyclogenesis, especially in the subpolar North Atlantic, while increased external migration intensifies cyclone activity in the Bering Sea and northeast Siberia. Summer declines result largely from reduced poleward intrusion of mid-latitude cyclones, particularly along continental margins. Yet increased cyclones around Greenland are driven by enhanced local cyclogenesis. These changes in local cyclogenesis and external migration are closely tied to variations in baroclinic instability and large-scale atmospheric flow patterns, respectively."

 Live forest biomass is essential in sequestering carbon and supporting ecosystem services. How much of the synthesized biomass ultimately stays in live plant biomass remain elusive. Here we propose a new proxy, biomass retention efficiency (BRE), to measure the efficiency of biosynthesized carbohydrates remained in live plant biomass in forests. Based on satellite measurements and terrestrial ecosystem models, we estimated that globally the median of BRE goes from 0.21% to 2.60%, much smaller than carbon use efficiency and biomass production efficiency (ca. 50%). Across forest types, BREs derived from different datasets exhibit inconsistent patterns. This large differences mainly stems from the inconsistency in quantifying biomass changes across different approaches. This small BRE highlights the importance of tracking the fate of nonliving biomass carbon for better understanding forest carbon sequestration, and the uncertainties emphasize the needs for coordinated effort for future improvements in high-quality large-scale biomass estimation and model-data integration. Only 0.2–2.6% of synthesized biomass stays in live plants at the global scale, as revealed by biomass retention efficiency, a newly developed metric based on satellite data and ecosystem models."

 Oceanic mesoscale eddies represent the most energetic component of the ocean circulation; however, their decay routes remain elusive, leaving a key gap in our understanding of the oceanic energy cascade. Here we combine satellite data with mooring measurements from the South China Sea in 2014 to reveal a rapid decay of oceanic eddies following the passage of typhoons. This decay is accompanied by a substantial generation of internal waves with near-inertial frequency in the ocean interior. The temporal correspondence and quantitatively commensurate energy changes indicate a direct energy transfer from eddy to internal wave field. We propose that typhoon-induced perturbations trigger an adjustment process within the eddy, resulting in energy loss through the radiation of near-inertial waves. Quantitatively supported by numerical model simulations, this mechanism plays a crucial role in the evolution of mesoscale eddies and points to a previously overlooked interior source of oceanic internal waves.

 The water surface elevation (WSE) of rivers serves as fundamental data for various hydrological research and applications. The recently launched Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite offers a revolutionary altimetry approach by providing wide-swath elevation mapping using a SAR Interferometer (InSAR) operating at Ka-band. While SWOT provides unprecedented spatio-temporal coverage of WSE, it has not been systematically compared with reference water stage databases. Currently, due to difficulties in accessing recent and globally homogenous gauge station records, established WSE derived from radar altimetry (RA) missions is the most suitable dataset to perform global validation of WSE. This study presents the first global-scale intercomparison of the two altimetry systems, the wide-swath InSAR technique used for the first time by SWOT and the classical along-track RA using the SAR technique, and identifies several representative factors influencing their consistency. SWOT WSE are compared with virtual stations derived from Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-6 missions, across five different node quality categories (“good”, “suspect”, “degraded”, “bad” and a combined “all” group without “bad” data). The analysis further examines the potential influences from river width, river ice, backscattering coefficients (sigma0), and dark water fraction in modulating data consistency. The root mean square error (and correlation coefficient) between WSE from SWOT and RA in “good” and “suspect” data are 0.80 m (0.85) and 1.62 m (0.78), respectively, while those for “degraded” and “bad” data rise significantly to 8.80 m (0.60) and 16.91 m (0.50). The combined “all” category yields an overall RMSE (CC) of 5.15 m (0.65). For rivers wider than 160 m, SWOT measurements with “good” and “suspect” quality demonstrate notably improved consistency with RA compared to narrower rivers. Under frozen conditions, the reduced consistency between SWOT and RA is most evident in the “degraded” and “bad” quality data, with average reductions in CC of 0.17 and 0.21, respectively. In addition, radar backscatter strongly impacts the quality of SWOT-based WSE, as both extremely low values (dark water) and very high values (specular ringing) can lead to unrealistic estimates. Overall, this study offers important insights into the global performance of SWOT-based WSE estimation and informs the future refinement and application of SWOT data in hydrological research."

 Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is a key parameter for characterizing the radiative forcing of atmospheric aerosols, yet some inconsistencies remain among different satellite products. In this study, Level-2 (L2) instantaneous and Level-3 (L3) monthly AOD products from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) were evaluated using observations from eight AERONET sites across East Asia for the period 2012–2023. We further analyzed the spatial distribution patterns and long-term climatological characteristics of AOD in this region. The results show that VIIRS generally exhibits the best overall performance for both L2 and L3 AOD products relative to AERONET, characterized by high correlation coefficients (R = 0.853 and 0.881), large fractions of retrievals within the expected error (75.34 % and 70.27 %), and comparatively low root mean square error (RMSE) and mean bias error (MBE). Nevertheless, the retrieval accuracy still exhibits pronounced regional variations among these satellite products. In desert regions, MISR performs the best with the highest fractions of retrievals within the expected error (65.14 % and 72.86 %), followed by MODIS, while the VIIRS L3 product shows notable overestimation. The consistency between L2 instantaneous retrievals and L3 monthly aggregates also varies considerably across surface types and among the three sensors. Despite these differences, the three satellite products display broadly consistent spatial patterns and temporal evolutions, commonly identifying similar high-AOD regions. On the interannual scale, all products reveal a persistent decline in AOD from central to eastern China (VIIRS: −0.021 a−1, MODIS: −0.023 a−1, MISR: −0.013 a−1) and an increasing trend over the Indian subcontinent (VIIRS: 0.006 a−1, MODIS: 0.008 a−1, MISR: 0.004 a−1). To further elucidate the climatological behavior of AOD and identify the meteorological factors most strongly associated with its long-term variations, a method combining principal component analysis (PCA) and multiple linear regression (MLR) is applied. The results indicate that over land, the AOD climatology and its interannual variability are most strongly associated with boundary layer height, whereas over ocean, AOD is influenced by a more complex combination of meteorological factors."

 PM1 and PM10 samples were collected at a downtown site in Elche, Spain, for one year. The oxidative potential (OP) of the samples was determined by the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay, along with the chemical composition, in order to identify the key components affecting OP of fine and coarse PM. The water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) content, which comprises many constituents identified as redox-active species in previous works, was measured for the first time at the sampling site. More than 70 % of WSOC was associated with submicron particles since it came mainly from biomass burning during winter and was formed by atmospheric photochemical reactions during the summer season. Average volume-normalised OP was very similar in the submicron and coarse fractions (0.21 and 0.17 nmol min−1 m−3, respectively), with values twice as high in winter than in summer. However, the intrinsic OP (OP of PM per unit mass) was notably higher in PM1 than in PM10–1 (28 and 14 pmol min−1 μg−1), indicating that submicron particles have a higher potential to generate reactive oxygen species and are potentially more hazardous. During winter PM1 OP was strongly associated with biomass burning species, including WSOC, due to the emissions of redox-active organic components from this source, and also with traffic tracers related to both exhaust and non-exhaust emissions. In contrast, during the warm season, the results of the correlation analysis point to relevant contributions from secondary organic aerosols and road dust resuspension. On the other hand, the DTT activity measured in PM10–1 was related to chemical species derived from exhaust and non-exhaust traffic emissions during winter and to marine species during the summer months."

 Summer precipitation in Central China (CC) is typically influenced by ocean-atmosphere coupling processes. However, the mechanisms through which land surface processes in surrounding regions affect CC precipitation, particularly those over the Indochina Peninsula (ICP), remain poorly understood. We propose that extreme heat events (TX90P) over the ICP during March–April-May (MAM) enhance June–July-August (JJA) precipitation in CC. ICP MAM TX90P establishes a self-reinforcing feedback loop through energy and moisture exchange processes at the land-atmosphere (L-A) interface, thereby amplifying the intensity of extreme heat events. Extreme heat events are accompanied by high-pressure systems with anomalous subsidence of airflow that suppress precipitation and reduce soil moisture (SM). The resulting dry soil establishes a positive feedback mechanism with precipitation, enabling the anomalous SM reduction to persist into JJA. This soil moisture memory effect-induced drought leads to weakened vertical motion over the ICP, promoting the formation of an anticyclonic circulation pattern spanning the ICP and Western Pacific (WP), which subsequently strengthens southwesterly winds that transport moisture toward CC, resulting in enhanced precipitation. Simulations using a Linear Baroclinic Model (LBM) confirm that ICP extreme heat events generate southwesterly wind anomalies, facilitating northeastward moisture transport to CC. A multiple linear regression model incorporating MAM TX90P, preceding winter El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and preceding winter Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) effectively reproduces observed JJA CC precipitation (r = 0.62). This result demonstrates that incorporating extreme heat-related land surface processes significantly improves precipitation prediction skill compared to models relying solely on oceanic variability."

 The mesoscale eddies present in many dynamic regions of the world ocean are known to modulate wind and precipitation in their vicinity. This study investigates the observed association between eddy activity in the western Bay of Bengal and seasonal rainfall over the monsoon core region during the boreal summer. A novel method is employed to characterise eddy variability in the Bay of Bengal using the Okubo-Weiss (OW) parameter. The anticyclonic (cyclonic) eddy activity in the western Bay correlates with increased (decreased) monsoon rainfall and westerly (easterly) wind anomalies across the monsoon core zone. During years when BoB is dominated by anticyclonic eddies, the seasonal Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) in this region exceeds the climatological mean by up to 35 % of its standard deviation. A mechanism linking the anticyclonic eddies and the ISMR is proposed here based on the observational data for the 1993–2022 period. The presence of anticyclonic eddies appears to mitigate the detrimental effects of El Niño on east-central Indian rainfall by fostering atmospheric conditions favourable for monsoon low-pressure system formation. Furthermore, years dominated by anticyclonic eddies exhibit a stronger, narrow coastal SST gradient in the northwestern Bay of Bengal, which may further enhance LPS development.Methodically structured model sensitivity experiments using a standalone atmospheric model substantiate the impact of mesoscale SST structures and the coastal gradient in the BoB on rainfall, thus providing potential evidence regarding the interplay between eddies and the Indian monsoon system."

 This study investigates the microphysical processes of lightning-producing convective clouds over Northeast India during September 2009, using unique in-situ measurements from an instrumented aircraft in conjunction with near-simultaneous Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite overpass observations. TRMM measurements revealed isolated convective cells with reflectivity up to 45 dBZ, storm tops near 14 km, and frequent lightning flashes (2–250 s−1), indicative of mature mixed-phase cumulonimbus systems. Aircraft-based droplet size distribution (DSD) measurements showed progressive spectral broadening with altitude and drizzle onset near the 0 °C isotherm level. Large values of liquid water content (LWC) near it promote the formation of supercooled water in colder regimes. The coexistence of supercooled droplets, ice, and graupel at sub-zero temperatures creates favorable conditions for charge separation. The hydrometeor axis ratio and diameter relationship is evaluated.Vertical profiles of droplet concentration, LWC, ice water content, effective radius (re), and autoconversion rates further highlight active droplet growth through collision–coalescence processes. The autoconversion rate was modulated by updraft transport and feedbacks from droplet depletion on drizzle formation. Scatter plot and normalized DSD analyses revealed distinct microphysical regimes: cloud-only (positive μ, high Nw, where μ is the shape parameter and Nw, the intercept parameter of normalized Gamma DSD) and cloud–drizzle (negative μ, reduced Nw). In warm, droplet-dominated clouds (2 <D<50μm, T>0°C), the relationships between re–LWC and μ–LWC become more pronounced. When both cloud droplets and drizzle are included (2 <D<50μm), these relationships weaken. In cold clouds (T<0°C), a strong coupling between μ and λ emerges. Considering only larger hydrometeors (50 <D<1550μm) in the cold regime further strengthens the μ–re, λ–μ, and μ–IWC relationships. Here, IWC denotes the ice water content. New empirical autoconversion relationships were derived from the DSDs and compared with published schemes. These results provide region-specific constraints for bulk microphysical parameterizations and highlight the need for further evaluation of the proposed schemes within modeling frameworks."
