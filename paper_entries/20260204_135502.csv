This descriptive scoping review pursues four objectives: (i) quantify CEC occurrence across the Global North and South, focusing on low- to middle-income developing countries (LMIDCs); (ii) assess policy frameworks and governance readiness; (iii) propose a feasible, phased roadmap for LMIDCs; and (iv) evaluate enabling conditions and potential impacts. Literature synthesised from 2020–2025 documents widespread contamination in drinking, surface, and wastewater, with concentrations in LMIDC hotspots 5–20 times higher than in the Global North. In South Africa’s Vaal River, PFAS exceeded 400 ng l−1, pharmaceuticals approached 1000 ng l−1, and MPs averaged approximately 31 particles m−3 in drinking water. Policy analysis reveals fragmented monitoring and limited treatment coverage in LMIDCs, in contrast to integrated, mixture-aware frameworks in the Global North. The proposed three-phase roadmap entails: (1) establishing CEC standards and baseline monitoring, (2) piloting targeted treatment supported by extended producer responsibility schemes, and (3) embedding adaptive, mixture-aware regulation within water safety plans. Feasibility analysis identifies enforceable standards, predictable financing, laboratory capacity, and public engagement as key success factors. Full implementation could reduce PFAS and pharmaceutical loads by 50%–80%, cut MPs by over 90%, and prevent multi-billion-dollar (USD) annual PFAS-related healthcare costs. These actions would help LMIDCs such as South Africa transition from reactive to proactive water-quality governance, and advance Sustainable Development Goals 6, 3, and 14."

Fires emit HCHO and its precursors and enhance secondary HCHO formation downwind, raising concerns about health impacts. However, the contribution of fire to ambient HCHO remains poorly quantified because ground-based monitoring is sparse and largely urban. Here, we present the first satellite-based quantification of fire-attributable HCHO enhancement and associated health risks across the contiguous U.S. from 2020–2023. We improve TROPOMI retrievals of HCHO columns to account for smoke aerosol effects, and evaluate the changes in column and surface HCHO under fire smoke using NOAA’s HMS smoke product. Annual mean HCHO shows a distinct increase under fire smoke, with vertical column density increased by 6%–16% and surface HCHO by 6%–11%. The spatial distribution of this enhancement aligns with major wildfire activities across California in 2020, the Pacific Northwest in 2021 and the Southern U.S. in 2022, and is most extensive in 2023, likely reflecting the combined influence of Canadian fire smoke intrusions, U.S. wildfires and elevated temperatures. Exposure at 2020–2023 levels translates to an estimated 275–482 excess lifetime cancer cases, indicating a non-negligible health burden from fire-related HCHO even in years of moderate fire activity."

To support these targets, projects of common and mutual interest (PCI-PMI)—large infrastructure projects for electricity, hydrogen and CO2 transport, and storage—have been identified by the European Commission. This study focuses on PCI-PMI projects related to hydrogen and carbon value chains, assessing their long-term system value and the impact of pipeline delays and shifting policy targets using the sector-coupled energy system model PyPSA-Eur. Our study shows that PCI-PMI projects enable a more cost-effective transition to a net-zero energy system compared to scenarios without any pipeline expansion. Hydrogen pipelines help distribute affordable green hydrogen from renewable-rich regions in the north and southwest to high-demand areas in central Europe, while CO2 pipelines link major industrial emitters with offshore storage sites. Although these projects are not essential in 2030, they begin to significantly reduce annual system costs by more than €26 billion from 2040 onward. Delaying implementation beyond 2040 could increase system costs by up to €24.2 billion per year, depending on the extent of additional infrastructure development. Moreover, our results show that PCI-PMI projects reduce the need for excess wind and solar capacity and lower reliance on individual CO2 removal technologies, such as direct air capture, by 13–136 Mt annually, depending on the build-out scenario."

Using ERA5 reanalysis data, the interdecadal changes of Rossby wave energy propagation (RWEP) pathways and their impacts are examined in the present work. The results demonstrate that the NH means of 500 hPa geopotential height anomalies vary with large interdecadal trends that keep in step with global warming, exhibiting a negative-to-positive phase transition from period I (1950/51–1996/97) to period II (1997/98–2024/25). Pronounced interdecadal eastward shifts occur systematically in interannual variabilities of apparent wave sources, which correspondingly result in large interdecadal changes of RWEP pathways in regions from the northeast Atlantic to Eurasia and from the northeast Pacific to North America. Significant interannual surface air temperature anomalies with extremes of around ±5 °C are induced by circulation variations in regions around these pathways, facilitating possible occurrences of climate extremes in Eurasia and North America with different spatial patterns between period II and period I."

Ozone changes were mainly influenced by stratospheric temperature and atmospheric circulation. A significant increase occurred at Marambio, and unusually warm conditions in September 2019 caused ozone to rise strongly over East Antarctica, improving understanding of how the ozone layer responds to environmental changes. 
 This study assesses trends in the total ozone column (TOC) and the atmospheric factors influencing ozone variability at three Antarctic stations (Marambio, Troll/Trollhaugen, and Concordia) from 2007 to 2023. Ground-based TOC measurements were used, supplemented by satellite observations from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument on NASA's Aura satellite. TOC trends were derived using a multiple linear regression model provided by the Long-term Ozone Trends and Uncertainties in the Stratosphere (LOTUS) project. The selected LOTUS model was able to explain 94 %–97 % of the TOC variability at all three stations. The regression analysis showed that ozone variability at these stations is mainly driven by the lower stratospheric temperature, eddy heat flux, and the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. A statistically significant increasing trend was found at the Marambio station (3.43 ± 3.22 DU per decade), while statistically insignificant trends were detected at the other two stations. Using MERRA-2 reanalyses, the LOTUS model was applied to each grid point in the 40–90° S region, which effectively illustrates the spatial distribution of the impacts of individual predictors. It was found that warmer conditions in the Antarctic stratosphere in September 2019 caused TOC to be up to 100 DU higher than normal, especially over East Antarctica. The results improve understanding of regional TOC trends and how the Antarctic ozone layer responds to changes in ozone-depleting substances."

Chen;Liine Heikkinen;Claudia Marcolli,"Cloud droplet number enhancement from co-condensing NH3, HNO3, and organic vapours: boreal case study","Ubiquitous semi-volatile compounds can co-condense on aerosol particles with water vapour when relative humidity increases. Simulations of cloud formation at a boreal forest site with a cloud parcel model that accounts for non-ideal organic–inorganic interactions yield an enhancement of cloud droplet number concentration from co-condensing NH3, HNO3, and organics up to 44%, with strong sensitivities to volatility distributions, aerosol size distribution, and updraft velocity. 
 Semi-volatile compounds such as organics, nitrate, chloride, and ammonium are ubiquitous in atmospheric aerosols. Their gaseous precursors (organics, HNO3, HCl, NH3) co-condense with water vapour when ambient relative humidity (RH) increases, thus enhancing hygroscopic growth under sub-saturated conditions and facilitating activation as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) to cloud droplets. In this study, we investigate the co-condensation effect on CCN activation for inorganics, organics, and their combination in a boreal forest site in autumn with our cloud parcel model that includes non-ideality of organic-inorganic mixtures. The volatility distribution of organics is highly uncertain but critically important to estimate the co-condensation effect. We compare two distinct volatility basis sets (VBS) established from experimental and modelling data at 25 °C, which we amended with a volatility bin of saturation concentration C*=104 µg m−3, which proved to be highly relevant for CCN activation. The combined co-condensation of organics and inorganics increases CDNC by up to 44 % in simulations initialized with RH of 80 %, depending on VBS distribution and updraft velocity during the air parcel uplifts. Non-ideality of the system is relevant for considering the co-condensation effect realistically. For the ideal case, the maximum CDNC enhancement due to the combined co-condensation effect is 53 % while it is 44 % for the non-ideal case. The combined enhancement in CDNC of inorganic and organic species exceeds the sum of individual effects and should be further constrained in different environments in cloud parcel models as a basis for regional and global simulations."

Kupinski;Christian Rolf;Martina Krämer,Evaluation of upper-tropospheric lower-stratospheric properties over the Asian monsoon region in a storm-resolving model,"We assess the temperature, moisture, and dynamics in the upper troposphere-lower stratosphere simulated over South Asia in a high-resolution model relative to aircraft data. The lower stratosphere tends to be too warm, too dry, and too quiescent in the model, and as a result, too few ice clouds are predicted to form there. These biases could affect radiative balance and circulation in other areas also, as significant upward transport of moisture and pollutants occurs during the Asian monsoon. 
 The structure of the tropical upper troposphere-lower stratosphere (UTLS) affects radiative balance, stability, and regional dynamics in important ways. Lack of reliable observational baselines poses a challenge to evaluating model representation of UTLS properties. Here, we use in-situ data, primarily from the StratoClim field campaign over the Asian Monsoon area, to assess the UTLS temperature, moisture, and ice clouds in the Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model at storm-resolving grid spacing. We also employ superpressure balloon data and updrafts of the POSIDON and ATTREX campaigns to evaluate the UTLS convective updrafts and gravity wave activity in ICON. Our simulations show the upper troposphere is too cold, while the lower stratosphere is too warm and excessively dry relative to observations. These thermodynamic biases coincide with overestimated cloud ice in the upper troposphere and underestimated cloud ice in the lower stratosphere. The mean convective updraft is underestimated by 80 % in the model, and the power spectral density for temperature fluctuations of frequencies greater than 10−3 s−1 is underestimated by orders of magnitude. Too weak dynamics exacerbate a lack of ice cloud above 100 hPa. Too weak and too infrequent convective overshoots or too rapid dissipation of upper-tropospheric ice clouds in the model are two possible explanatory mechanisms for these biases."

This first pole-to-pole study of marine air reveals a strong latitudinal divide, with higher concentrations in the polluted Northern Hemisphere. A key discovery is that air influenced by Antarctic sea ice is enriched in organic nitrogen, revealing a major natural source. Our new dataset improves climate models by clarifying how human emissions and natural processes shape the atmosphere. 
 Organic nitrogen (ON) is an important yet poorly constrained component of aerosol total nitrogen (TN), particularly over remote oceans. We quantified aerosol ON in 92 total suspended particulate samples collected across approximately 160° of latitude in the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) during Chinese Antarctic and Arctic expeditions (2019–2024), using a newly developed method that simultaneously determines ON and inorganic nitrogen. A significant latitudinal gradient was observed, with significantly higher ON concentrations (expressed as N) in the Northern Hemisphere (83.3 ± 141.4 ng m−3) than in the Southern Hemisphere (15.4 ± 12.4 ng m−3). Regionally, coastal East Asia recorded the highest ON levels (164.6 ± 179.1 ng m−3) but a lower ON/TN ratio (21.1 ± 7.9 %), indicating strong terrestrial and anthropogenic influence. In contrast, the Arctic Ocean had lower ON concentrations (19.1 ± 19.0 ng m−3) but the highest ON/TN ratio (38.6 ± 12.4 %), suggesting dominant marine biogenic sources. The Southern Ocean showed the lowest ON concentration (12.0 ± 7.1 ng m−3) yet a relatively high ON/TN ratio (27.8 ± 11.0 %), also pointing to oceanic origins. Near Antarctica, samples influenced by sea-ice air masses displayed markedly elevated ON and ON/TN ratios. These increases were strongly correlated with sea ice concentration and chlorophyll a exposure, indicating enhanced biogenic emissions from sea-ice-associated ecosystems. This study offers the first direct ON measurements along a global MABL transect, revealing distinct latitudinal and regional patterns, and emphasizing the combined roles of continental inputs and marine sources. It also identifies sea-ice dynamics as a key factor influencing ON in Antarctic regions, providing crucial data for improving atmospheric and climate models."

Barnet,Mapping stratospheric nitric acid (HNO3) patterns in the extratropics with nadir-viewing infrared sounders – a retrieval perspective,"Once Aura is decommissioned, the multi-decadal microwave limb sounder (MLS) record of stratospheric HNO3 will end. This paper presents the retrieval of stratospheric HNO3 from nadir infrared sounders. We demonstrate the retrieval of stratospheric HNO3, independent of tropospheric signal and noise, that broadly reflects the variation captured by MLS. This novel retrieval approach improves upon the status quo and lays the foundation for validation studies and product roll-out in future. 
 With this paper, we aim to demonstrate how stratospheric HNO3 can be retrieved from nadir hyperspectral infrared (IR) measurements such that it is largely uncorrelated with tropospheric HNO3 and most other interfering signals. This is achieved by decomposing the set of HNO3 sensitive channels into orthogonal vectors that isolate the stratospheric HNO3 signal for use in the retrieval. Such a nadir-IR HNO3 product could add useful information to the monitoring of some stratospheric chemical processes affecting ozone in the extratropics, especially once the state-of-the-art Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on Aura is decommissioned in 2026. Nitric acid is typically used as indicator species for heterogeneous chemical processing inside the winter polar stratospheric vortices. The proposed stand-alone stratospheric HNO3 retrieval would be an improvement over the only other nadir-IR HNO3 product available today, namely FORLI (Fast Optimal Retrieval on Layers for IASI), which is a stratosphere + troposphere correlated profile retrieval affected by uncertainty in tropospheric water vapor at the time of measurement. We demonstrate the potential of this new stratospheric nadir-IR HNO3 retrieval strategy using the Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Combined Atmospheric Processing System (CLIMCAPS) as the retrieval framework with measurements from CrIS (Cross-track Infrared Sounder) on the Joint Polar Satellite System 1 (JPSS-1) during the Northern Hemisphere winter of 2019/2020. Future work will focus on optimizing and validating CLIMCAPS HNO3 retrievals for operational deployment."

The annual carbon emission flux provides a robust historical baseline for assessing terrestrial ecosystem carbon budgets at national and provincial scales, both in the present and future. 
 Long-term land-use changes have a profound impact on terrestrial ecosystems and the associated carbon balance. Current estimates of China's historical carbon emissions induced by land-use change vary widely. Here, current mainland China was taken as the study area, and the 32 provincial units (excluding Macao and Hong Kong) were merged into 25 regions. We utilized a bookkeeping method to quantify China's annual carbon budget resulting from land-use change between 1000 and 2019, driven by a millennial dataset of land-use change in China at provincial level, assisted by comprehensive soil and vegetation carbon density datasets. This approach, which was supported by high-confidence land-use change data, a comprehensive carbon density database compiled from over 10 000 existing field samples, and the latest published disturbance-response curves, enhanced the accuracy of carbon budget estimates. The results revealed that cumulative carbon emissions from land-use change in China reached 19.61 Pg C over the past millennium. Moreover, critical turning points occurred in the early 18th century and early 1980s, with emissions accelerating in the 18th century and transitioning from carbon source to carbon sink in the early 1980s. Our findings revealed that the values were 68 %–328 % higher than the previous 300-year estimates, suggesting that historical carbon emissions from land-use change in China may have been significantly underestimated.

 Functional traits of species are becoming increasingly used in ecological research, providing key insights into organisms-environment interactions, ecosystem functions, and responses to environmental changes. In recent years, substantial initiatives have generated major open-access datasets of species' functional traits. However, these resources typically concentrate on a handful of well-studied biological groups—such as plants, birds, and fishes—and less on specific biogeographic regions limiting their applicability in regional biodiversity assessments and conservation planning. Here, we present TraitCH, a comprehensive dataset of functional traits spanning over 71,874 species (≥ 1 functional trait) across 17 major taxonomic groups: Apocrita (2,278), Arachnida (3,728), Coleoptera (8,565), Ephemeroptera/Plecoptera/Trichoptera (1,349), Lepidoptera (3,757), Odonata (234), Orthoptera (1,283), Bryobiotina (2,285), Fungi (12,469), Lichen (2,435), Mollusca (7,493), Pisces (838), Amphibia (151), Aves (1,356), Mammalia (522), Reptilia (298), and Tracheophyta (22,833).

Our model captured both the timing and extent of mortality. A new bark beetle module improved predictions for spruce. High soil water capacity and heterogeneous soils reduced drought impacts. These findings offer new insights to anticipate forest responses in a warming, drying climate. 
 Drought is increasingly recognized as a critical driver of forest dynamics, altering tree species' growth, dominance and survival.  To better understand these dynamics, we used a process-based modeling approach to investigate drought-related mortality of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) in German forests. The predisposing-inciting (PI) framework for drought-induced tree mortality incorporated in ForClim v4.1 was combined with a bark beetle module for Norway spruce to account for a key contributing factor, leading to ForClim v4.2.Our study addressed three hypotheses: (1) the PI framework, initially developed for Swiss beech forests, is effective across the broad ecological and climatic gradients found in Germany; (2) Soil properties, i.e. soil water holding capacity (AWC) and its spatial heterogeneity, have a strong influence on drought-related mortality by amplifying mortality risk through limited microsite variability, or dampening it by providing moist refugia, thus complementing climatic drivers; (3) incorporating bark beetle damage ameliorates model performance for simulating drought-related mortality of Norway spruce. Our modelling approach deliberately forgoes calibration to better investigate the underlying mechanisms and drivers of drought-induced tree mortality.We conducted simulations across 149 plots of the ICP Forest Level I network in Germany, covering a wide gradient of climate and soil conditions. ForClim reproduced the general patterns of drought-related mortality, highlighting the ability of the PI framework to capture emergent mortality patterns across a range of environmental conditions. However, mismatches in magnitude and trends highlight areas for improvement. Discrepancies were attributed to sparse mortality data, the drought sensitivity of the bark beetle submodule, and the absence of regional calibration. Our results revealed the critical role of AWC and local soil heterogeneity in modulating drought responses. Sites with low AWC experienced significantly higher mortality rates, while high AWC provided a buffering effect, bringing simulated outcomes closer to observed data. Furthermore, soil heterogeneity played a mitigating role, with sites exhibiting uniform soils showing higher mortality risk, thus emphasizing the importance of the spatial variability of soil properties for dampening drought impacts. Lastly, the new bark beetle submodel, even though highly simplified, considerably improved the simulation of drought-related mortality patterns in Norway spruce-dominated sites.This study underscores the value of process-based models like ForClim for disentangling the mechanisms underlying forest vulnerability and drought-induced mortality. However, improvements such as finer-resolution mortality and crown condition data, as well as regional model calibration, would be useful to enhance its predictive accuracy. Our findings contribute to the better understanding, forecasting and managing of forest resistance under current and future climatic conditions."

Evaluated with a warm bubble case, LEX maintains high accuracy as the Cloud Model 1. With the hardware acceleration and better numerical stability, LEX can be quite faster. To report its differentiability, we further trained a deep learning-based parameterization scheme. The newly trained model can surpass the conventional scheme and get proper forecast results. 
 Large-eddy simulations (LES) are essential tools for studies on atmospheric turbulence and clouds and play critical roles in the development of turbulence and convection parameterizations. Current numerical weather models have approached kilometer-scale resolution as supercomputing facilities advance. However, this resolution range is in the so-called gray zone, where subgrid-scale (SGS) turbulence actively interacts with resolved motion and significantly influences the large-scale characteristics of simulated weather systems. Thus, a novel LES framework is required to enable the development of new SGS approaches for the gray zone. Here we used the Python library JAX to develop a new LES model. It is based on the generalized pseudo-incompressible equations formulated by Durran (2008). For a classic warm bubble case, the traditional Smagorinsky model fails to reproduce the correct structure evolution of the warm bubble, though it can modestly correct the rising speed in gray-zone resolution simulations. Utilizing the capability of JAX for automatic differentiation, we trained a deep learning-based SGS turbulence model for the same case. The trained deep learning SGS model, based on a simple autoencoder (AE), enables this physics-deep learning hybrid model to accurately simulate the expansion of the thermal bubble and the development of rotors surrounding the center of the bubble at a gray-zone resolution. The gray-zone simulation results are comparable to those of the benchmark LES resolution."

Roche;Didier Paillard;Pradeebane Vaittinada Ayar,GeoDS (v.1.0): a simple Geographical DownScaling model for long-term precipitation data over complex terrains,"Due to the limited spatial and temporal coverage of observations, global models are essential tools to study climate. However, long-term climate data at fine spatial scale are difficult to obtain because of elevated computational costs such algorithms involve. This paper presents a simple model based on the description of climate/topography interactions to generate local precipitation fields at low cost. The objective is to provide a flexible and easy to use method for paleoclimate studies. 
 Global climate models offer the most comprehensive description of the climate system and its internal processes to date but current computational capabilities typically restrict their spatial resolution to the order of hundreds of kilometers when long-term (millennial or longer) simulations are needed. Over the years, various downscaling techniques have been developed to generate fine scale data from climate models outputs but they often exhibit important limitations when applied over long periods of time. Building on previous efforts, we present a simple topography-based model (GeoDS) to downscale precipitation fields in complex areas, adapted to paleoclimate studies involving multi-millennia simulations. With a limited amount of inputs from a climate model and high resolved geographical information, the model computes, for each time step and every grid point, a topographic exposure index used to distribute precipitation into a high-resolution spatial grid. This dimensionless quantity represents the exposure of surfaces to dominant windward incoming airflows, assumed to bring most of the humidity, and only depends on large scale winds and terrain configuration. The model is first tested under current climate conditions over part of the European Alpine region due to the availability of field data for comparison; the complexity of both regional topography and climate conditions making it a good test of the proposed methodology. The relative effects of the model's parameters are assessed as well as the capacity of GeoDS to reproduce the spatial precipitation distribution of a well-resolved gridded target dataset. Despite uncertainties regarding the correct wind fields to choose as input, and the dependency of the model to the temporal resolution of the large-scale data to downscale, we show that the procedure is able to capture most of the patterns occurring at fine spatial scale while being computationally inexpensive. We also demonstrate that the physical base underlying our work grants the model valuable robustness when used outside the calibration framework. This notably opens promising prospects for the application of GeoDS in paleoclimate contexts while providing a flexible, open source and well documented downscaling tool for the climate community."

Burls,A revised temperature-dependent remineralization scheme for the Community Earth System Model (v1.2.2),"Earth System Models are an essential tool for climate studies, yet temperature-sensitive parameters are often absent, resulting in a gap in model predictive capabilities. Organic carbon breakdown, also known as remineralization, is one such process. Here, we add this parameter to the Community Earth System Model and find improved regional patterns of carbon export. The new code will serve as a useful tool to improve the examination of marine carbon cycle feedbacks to changing climate conditions. 
 Export of carbon from the euphotic zone to intermediate and deep water plays a critical role in the ocean's feedback response to a warming climate. However, as water temperature increases so does the rate of bacterial respiration at the base of the biological pump, resulting in more efficient recycling of carbon in the upper ocean, less efficient export of carbon to depth, and a diminished net negative feedback on climate. Therefore, to better predict climate response associated with changes in ocean carbon storage in warming scenarios, it is imperative to incorporate temperature-sensitive mechanisms, such as bacterial respiration (remineralization), into Earth system models. Here, we employ a new temperature-dependent parameterization for remineralization (Tdep) in the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1) applied to gravitationally sinking particulate organic carbon (POC) in a preindustrial control simulation. We find that the inclusion of Tdep in both low and high-resolution model configurations more accurately captures regional heterogeneity in POC transfer efficiency while preserving the overall trends in nutrient distribution and attenuation of sinking particulate matter when compared with modern empirical data. Inclusion of this parametrization will allow for improved predictions of temperature-sensitive mechanisms impacting carbon storage in the warming ocean."

This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of QACs in assisted living facilities through the analysis of 19 QACs from three different QAC subgroups in indoor dust and air samples collected from three assisted living facilities in Indiana, United States (US), as well as in wristbands worn by the residents and staff of these facilities. The medians of the total QAC concentrations (∑QAC, the sum of 19 QAC concentrations) were 151,000 ng/g in dust, 3.17 ng/m3 in air, and 2,290 ng/g in wristbands. Benzylalkyldimethylammonium compounds (BACs) were the most abundant QAC group in all three matrices and contributed 58–87% to the ∑QAC concentrations. The QAC distribution patterns found in dust, air, and wristbands were similar to those reported for disinfecting products, suggesting these products could be an important indoor source in assisted living. QAC concentrations in wristbands worn by staff during their work shift were significantly higher than those in wristbands worn by residents (p < 0.05). In addition, the levels found in dust from assisted living were several times higher than those previously reported in US residential households. Concentrations of C12-, C14-, and C16-BACs in dust, air, and wristbands significantly and positively correlated, suggesting common sources in the indoor environment. Estimated daily intake (EDI) of QACs suggests that accidental dust ingestion is the predominant exposure route, accounting for approximately 62% of the total QAC intake. The elevated QAC concentrations in assisted living facilities are of concern for the residents and staff of these facilities because of the potential health risks associated with exposure to these chemicals, such as respiratory effects."

In this paper, we used satellite-derived data to assess outdoor PM2.5 concentrations at 1,593 prisons in the contiguous U.S. from 1998 to 2022. Across our study period, despite overall national decreases in PM2.5 concentrations and disparities, prisons on average experienced higher pollution than the nonincarcerated U.S. population. In 2022, over 500 prisons had spatially averaged concentrations higher than the population-weighted concentrations of their home states. We also found evidence that in 12 states, state and federal prison populations systematically had higher PM2.5 than the nonincarcerated populations in those states; similar findings were obtained for national analyses stratified by degree of urbanicity. In 2022, about 7% of prisons were above federal air quality standards, with over 50% of these prisons located in California. Collectively, the contributions of this study in finding health-relevant disparities in outdoor PM2.5 concentrations for prisons across several different metrics may highlight an urgent public health crisis that requires deeper inquiry and interventions from government officials. Decarceration would work to immediately reduce the population of people vulnerable to air pollution in prisons."

Here, we characterize the molecular composition, summer–winter differences, and sources of gaseous OOMs in urban Beijing using an iodide chemical ionization mass spectrometer. Our results show that C4–C5 molecules, especially isoprene oxidation products, accounted for 48% of measured OOMs in summer, while CHO molecules and nitrophenols dominated in winter (∼60%). Most OOMs, particularly organic nitrates in the summer and organic acids in the winter, showed significant increases during polluted episodes. OOMs also increased significantly during summer heatwaves due to enhanced volatilization and precursor emissions. Source apportionment identified ten OOM factors, with isoprene-related factors contributing 43% of OOMs in summer, and nitrophenols and O4 organic acids prevailing in winter. The relationship between the OOMs and SOA indicated that more than half of summertime SOA is linked to isoprene-related oxidation, while nitrophenols and highly oxidized organic acids contributed most under elevated PM2.5 levels in winter. Emission controls during the 2022 Winter Olympic Games effectively reduced several OOMs groups, particularly organic acids, while increasing the formation of nitrogen-containing species. Overall, this work reveals the distinct summer–winter behavior of OOMs in Beijing and their varied roles in SOA formation under changing atmospheric and regulatory conditions."

Reliance on nominal (administered) concentration (assumed dose) does not account for chemical distribution to cellular and noncellular elements of an in vitro assay system. Chemical distribution can reduce the free concentration available to cause effects and can result in an inaccurate estimate of the intracellular concentration causing any observed perturbations. There are mathematical, chemical property-based partitioning models for predicting cellular concentrations when not measured experimentally. This work evaluated two of these in vitro disposition models, Armitage et al., 2021 and Kramer et al., 2010, using a total of 153 experimental intracellular concentration measurements of 43 chemicals, along with parameters describing measurement conditions, from 12 peer reviewed studies in addition to data generated for this study. Intracellular concentrations were more accurately predicted by both the Armitage model (root mean squared log10 error (RMSLE) = 1.12) and the Kramer model (RMSLE = 1.30) than by the nominal concentration (RMSLE = 1.45).

Twenty outdoor environmental exposures from three domains, air pollutants, meteorological conditions, and geographical features were assessed. DS was measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. An exposome-wide association study was used to explore associations and identify important environmental exposures related to DS, followed by eXtreme Gradient Boosting to rank their relative importance. Composite scores for three environmental domains were constructed to assess their joint impacts on DS. Exposure to PM2.5, PM10, temperature, wind speed, artificial light at night, and building density were significantly associated with increased odds of DS, while higher relative humidity, and higher greenness indicators (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI], forest-shrub-grass coverage, and cropland coverage) were inversely associated. Among all exposures, building density showed the greatest contribution in the model ranking. Considering the joint impacts, unfavorable environmental profiles across all three domains were significantly associated with higher odds of DS, particularly among children with abnormal weight or higher metabolic risk. Importantly, population attributable fraction analysis indicates that improving environmental profiles could theoretically reduce 14.22–29.41% of DS cases, with geographical factors showing the largest theoretical contribution. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating environmental considerations into mental health strategies and support urban design and air quality improvements as tailored interventions for vulnerable populations to reduce the burden of DS."

This study presents a set of laboratory experiments examining the role of bottom substrates and hyporheic exchange on eDNA fate and transport. A conceptual model is proposed wherein eDNA transport is governed by competition between adsorption/desorption processes and hydrodynamic forces which remobilize eDNA across the water column and sediment storage zones. Retention experiments were conducted for plane and gravel beds, while breakthrough experiments were performed across both bed types and two hydraulic regimes. To quantify eDNA settling rates and validate the conceptual model, an independent experiment under quiescent conditions was performed. Breakthrough curves were analyzed using a continuous time random walk (CTRW) model. Enhanced exchange and retention rates were observed for eDNA in the gravel bed, showing that surface–subsurface interactions and turbulence influenced downstream transport distances. Effective velocities were significantly lower for eDNA than for a conservative tracer across both bed types at low flows. These results underscore that parafluvial processes, including hyporheic exchange and storage in sediments, play a crucial role in eDNA transport dynamics within slow-moving lotic environments."

The antO transcription was significantly upregulated upon addition of Sb(III). AntO is predicted to be a catalase-like heme-binding peroxidase, similar to the uncharacterized SrpA. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that AntO represents a novel Sb(III) oxidase or catalase. In E. coli AW3110(Δars), AntO confers Sb(III) resistance and oxidation activity and is induced by Sb(III) and H2O2. Further analysis confirms that antO mediates Sb(III) oxidation and H2O2 decomposition in JL40. Purified AntO catalyzes Sb(III) oxidation (with NADP+ as an electron acceptor) and H2O2 decomposition in vitro. Molecular docking shows that these reactions occur in distinct AntO structural domains.

Here, we prepared carboxymethyl-β-cyclodextrin (CMCD)-anchored WO3 that enabled visible-light-driven mineralization of acetaldehyde even under O2-free conditions. Anchoring CMCD on WO3 facilitated interfacial charge separation, enhancing the photocatalytic performance. Spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses revealed that loading CMCD on WO3 induced the formation of a charge-transfer complex via C–O–W bonding and extended the charge carrier lifetime by trapping electrons in CMCD. CMCD/WO3 sustained •OH generation under visible light (λ > 420 nm) and fully mineralized acetaldehyde even in the absence of O2. It also produced dioxygen from water oxidation in O2-free conditions, supplying O2 needed to fully mineralize VOCs to CO2, and it enabled an unconventional three-electron reduction of O2 to •OH. CMCD/WO3 exhibited a visible light degradation efficiency comparable to that of Pt-loaded WO3. In particular, CMCD/WO3 exhibited a higher carbon mass balance for acetaldehyde degradation than Pt/WO3, and this value remained nearly unchanged under both oxygen-rich and oxygen-free conditions. CMCD/WO3 also demonstrated long-term stability across repeated photocatalytic cycles with no decomposition of the CMCD structure. These findings highlight a supramolecular design strategy for developing an unconventional visible-light-active photocatalyst for indoor air purification, especially in enclosed or oxygen-depleted environments where conventional photocatalysts fail to operate."

The heterologous expression of the arsRhgcAB gene cluster conferred the ability to methylate mercury to O. alaskensis G20, supporting its sufficiency to induce CH3Hg production in a non-methylating sulfate-reducing host.

Additionally, the engineered O. alaskensis G20 strain exhibited lower demethylation rates than the wild-type one, with a saturable kinetic profile similar to that of P. hydrargyri BerOc1, indicating that a regulatory mechanism, likely mediated by ArsR, limits demethylation.

In the review, we synthesize recent developments in sampling and analytical methods, evaluate isotopic end-member values for various Nr sources, and examine fractionation behavior during transformation. We further provide a comparative overview of global patterns and long-term trends in Nr, drawing on ∼1700 isotopic data points from published studies covering major regions including East Asia, North America, and Europe, spanning 1956–2023. We find that isotopic end-member values for many Nr sources are now well constrained, providing a strong basis for source identification. However, wide variability remains for certain sources, such as soil and livestock emissions, indicating the need for further targeted investigation. In addition, isotopic differences are observed among different physical forms of the same compound (e.g., particulate versus aqueous), likely reflecting variations in isotopic fractionation during formation. These effects should therefore be explicitly considered in isotope-based source attribution. The compiled data reveal pronounced regional contrasts in Nr sources and formation pathways. For example, oxidized Nr [e.g., nitrate (NO3–)] in East Asia (δ15N-NO3–: +5.0 ± 5.6‰) shows stronger influence from combustion emissions compared with North America (−0.2 ± 4.9‰) and Europe (−1.0 ± 3.8‰). Interannual variability also differs: values in East Asia peaked around 2017 and have since declined, whereas North America exhibits a nearly opposite trend. Reduced Nr shows comparable regional and temporal variability. These patterns largely reflect differences in energy use, pollution control policies, and the pace of energy transitions. In addition, oxidized Nr formation exhibits a clear latitudinal gradient, with ozone becoming a more dominant oxidant at higher latitudes. This trend underscores differences in atmospheric oxidation capacity and provides observational constraints for previous model predictions. In summary, this review presents current methodologies, isotopic signatures, fractionation processes, and a comprehensive global Nr data set, demonstrating that isotope techniques are now an essential tool for tracing Nr and for advancing understanding and management of the global nitrogen cycle."

During the wildfire season, daily average indoor PM2.5 levels were higher during wildfire episodes (7.1 μg m–3) than in the absence of fires (3.5 μg m–3), whereas the indoor-to-outdoor PM2.5 ratios (0.42 vs 0.48) and infiltration factors were lower (0.25 vs 0.28 on fire and nonfire days, respectively). Increases in indoor PM2.5 due to wildfires were comparable to the spread in PM2.5 values between clean homes and those with many indoor particle generating activities, such as cooking. Overall, Canadian homes protected against PM2.5 exposure during wildfire episodes on average, but the variability of indoor PM2.5 exposure in the absence of wildfires across different homes was comparable in magnitude to the increases in PM2.5 due to wildfires."

The thermal and photochemical ozonolysis of N-EC was investigated in terms of kinetics, products, mechanism, and environmental implications. O3 uptake was observed on various N-EC under dark conditions, with the average O3 uptake coefficient (γav) in the range of (0.32–1.21) × 10–5. Light generally promoted O3 uptake on N-EC, and the extent of enhancement was correlated to hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and singlet oxygen (1O2) derived from the photoexcited N-EC. However, light was found to suppress HONO production from the ozonolysis of nitenpyram (NPM), a representative N-EC. HONO can be generated from either the O3 attack or the electrophilic addition of •OH on the C═C–NO2 structure by the photochemical ozonolysis of NPM, but HONO production by the •OH attack was less efficient than that from the O3 attack. Our results indicate that the O3 uptake process on N-EC containing C═C–NO2 would contribute to the atmospheric HONO source in the range of 74–740 ppt h–1."

While the carcinogenic risks of first- and secondhand smoke are well established, the tumorigenic potential of THS remains inadequately understood. In this perspective, we systematically review the known THS-related compounds together with the existing biological findings to provide evidence on the carcinogenic potential of THS. We assess the role of THS in the context of the classic multistage model of tumorigenesis to address whether THS acts primarily as a tumor initiator, or as a promoter, or both. We also discuss methodological challenges in isolating the effects of THS on human health and the importance of animal models and outline emerging strategies for risk assessment, biomarker discovery, and precision prevention. This Perspective is the first to integrate chemical, toxicological, and mechanistic evidence to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of THS within the framework of the multistage model of tumorigenesis, offering a new conceptual foundation for understanding the role of THS in human cancer etiology, which is crucial for informing public health policies aimed at mitigating its impact."

Developmental arsenic (As) exposure is linked to metabolic disorders, but its effects on MAFLD-related phenotypes remain unclear. This study aims to assess the impact of prenatal As exposure on MAFLD-like phenotypes in adulthood offspring. Pregnant mice were given deionized water containing NaAsO2 at concentrations of 0, 1.5, and 15 mg/L throughout their pregnancy. Doses were selected based on environmentally relevant exposure (1.5 mg/L, L-As) and prior evidence of metabolic effects in rodents (15 mg/L, H–As). Gestational H–As exposure increased hepatic triglyceride content and enlarged hepatic lipid droplets in middle-aged offspring. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test analyses revealed that prenatal L-As and H–As exposure impaired glucose and insulin tolerance in middle-aged offspring. White fat mass and adipocyte size were elevated in H–As exposed middle-aged offspring. Several metabolism-related hormones, including adiponectin, leptin, and insulin, were elevated, whereas glucagon-like peptide-1, a hormone secreted by the intestines, was reduced in H–As exposed female middle-aged offspring. These results demonstrate that prenatal As-alone promotes MAFLD-like phenotypes in middle-aged offspring, highlighting its role as an early life environmental trigger for metabolic disease."

Using large‐ensemble climate simulations, we identify the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) as a potential driver of interdecadal changes in winter northern European precipitation. During the 1980–2014 IPO phase transition, internal variability induced a drying trend of −0.07 mm day−1 (35 years)−1, offsetting a concurrent externally forced wetting trend of +0.19 mm day−1 (35 years)−1. This influence arises from IPO‐related modulation of atmospheric circulation and moisture transport. The persistence of IPO–WNEP linkages into 2015–2050 suggests that internal variability may continue to shape near‐future hydroclimate. Accounting for IPO‐related influences reduces projection uncertainty by 30% historically and 20% in the near future. These results highlight the critical role of internal variability in long‐term European precipitation trends and emphasize its relevance for regional water resource planning."

In this study, we used multi‐source atmospheric water vapor isotope data sets, including satellite and ground‐based observations, to investigate the role of evapotranspired water vapor (EWV) during CHDE. We identified a vertical dipole pattern in water vapor isotopes, with depletion in the lower troposphere and enrichment in the middle troposphere. This pattern is primarily driven by vertically transported EWV, which can reach altitudes up to 500 hPa. More importantly, the upward transport of EWV plays a key role in the warming of the middle troposphere, creating a saddle‐shaped temperature structure of the troposphere. This suggests that enhancing the forecasting capability of numerical weather prediction models for extreme CHDE should involve an adequate consideration of the warming effect of vertically transported EWV within the model framework."

Krier;Hanli Liu;Guiping Liu,Role of the Diurnal Tide in Driving the Westward Phase of the Mesospheric Semiannual Oscillation Around March Equinox,"The mesospheric semiannual oscillation (MSAO) in tropical zonal‐mean zonal winds exhibits a strong westward phase around March equinox. It has been thought that the migrating diurnal tide (DW1) plays a role in the initiation of this phase because DW1 peaks around this time and satellite observations have shown it to undergo wave breaking. The high‐resolution (HR) Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere and ionosphere extension successfully simulates the strong westward phase of the MSAO in contrast with its coarser resolution counterpart. In this work, we show that the wave breaking of DW1, between about 85 and 100 km, serves as the dominant westward acceleration mechanism. However, between about 80 and 85 km, diurnal wave broadening and DW1 nonlinearity is responsible for the westward acceleration. These results demonstrate the utility of HR whole atmosphere modeling, which explicitly resolves small‐scale gravity waves, in revealing multiscale wave dynamics."

However, the mechanisms and future trends of this enhancement remain inadequately understood. Analysis of multiple reanalysis data sets shows that during summer seasons of 1981–2020, approximately 45.6% of global lands exhibit a significant intensifying SM‐T coupling trend, with hotspots in Northeast Asia, Central Asia, and southwestern North America. Ridge regression reveals the drying SM (contribution: 50.2%) dominates the enhanced SM‐T coupling, followed by greening vegetation (28.3%) and decreasing cloud cover (21.5%). Furthermore, pre‐summer vegetation greening has the effect of intensifying the summer SM‐T coupling. Despite discrepancies in climate models' simulations of SM‐T coupling trend, the optimal multi‐model ensemble mean well reproduces SM‐T coupling's spatiotemporal characteristics. Based on this multi‐model ensemble mean, the enhancement of SM‐T coupling is attributed to anthropogenic forcings and projected to further intensify under future emission scenarios."

While the drivers of climatological ISMR onset are well discussed, the causes of delayed ISMR onset remain unclear. This study shows that the delay is primarily driven by anomalous high pressure over the Arabian Sea and anomalous low pressure over the Mascarene High, which weakens the regional Hadley circulation and, consequently, the low‐level moist southwesterly winds over the Arabian Sea. This weakening of southwesterlies directly delays the ISMR onset. When the ocean forces the atmosphere over the Arabian Sea, it alters the earlier delaying conditions and creates a favorable environment for the ISMR onset. The key novelty of this study is understanding the combined role of the Mascarene High, regional Hadley circulation, and Arabian Sea air–sea interactions in regulating delayed ISMR onset, offering new insights for improving ISMR onset prediction."

While deep learning models have demonstrated improved prediction skills, their performances are constrained by biases in climate models used for training and lack dynamic interpretability. Here we construct a novel hybrid model that integrates deep learning techniques into a dynamical model, enabling information exchanging during integration. Training on physical‐informed data, the model continuously adapts and improves forecasts, achieves unprecedented ENSO prediction skills, particularly in El Niño diversity and the spring predictability barrier. Moreover, as the hybrid model requires only a small volume of data by training on observations, it circumvents biases in climate models. Enhanced prediction skills arise primarily from improved representation of the leading feedbacks associated with ENSO. Our results suggest that training models with physical‐informed data is an effective approach for ENSO prediction."

These remote HC adjustments arise through both pure atmospheric and ocean‐atmosphere coupling mechanisms, yet their relative importance remains unclear. In this study, we integrate observations with climate model experiments to assess the roles of pure atmospheric and coupled ocean‐atmosphere pathways linking ENSO to the global HC adjustments. Results show that El Niño intensifies deep convection over the Pacific but suppresses convection over the Atlantic and Indian Oceans via the tropospheric temperature mechanism. Meanwhile, El Niño‐induced Atlantic and Indian Oceans warming enhances convection and regional HC. These two pathways exert opposing influences, with pure atmospheric pathway as the dominant driver. These findings establish a novel inter‐basin dynamical perspective for ENSO‐related tropical circulation adjustments and clarify the relative importance of different pathways, offering important implications for understanding ENSO‐induced global climate impacts."

SW2 shows a substantial response to both SPVs, though the Antarctic influence is weaker. During boreal winter, 50% of SW2 variability is linked to Arctic SPV strength, while 34% during austral spring is associated with Antarctic SPV. Classical tidal theory Hough modes (HMs) of SW2 point to a clear relationship between the HMs and Arctic SPV with the most significant change occurring in the first antisymmetric (2,3) HM. However, only the second symmetric (2,4) HM responds significantly to the Antarctic SPV. These distinctive differences in HMs arise from dynamic changes in the stratosphere and MLT. Stratospheric ozone contributes only 6%–10% to the (2,2) HM during weak state of Arctic SPV and shows no significant influence under Antarctic SPV variability. As such, HM variabilities are primarily caused by changes in background neutral winds during weak and strong Arctic and Antarctic SPVs rather than changes in stratospheric ozone heating. In addition, the zonal momentum budget of each HM of SW2 is analyzed. The classical term (Coriolis + pressure gradient forcing) exhibits the largest variations with the strength of the Arctic and Antarctic SPVs, followed by the advection term."

Caldow,Improving Methane Emission Estimates in Gippsland: Insights From Bayesian Inversion and In Situ Observations,"This study refines methane emission estimates for southeastern Australia's Gippsland region in 2019 through high‐resolution atmospheric inverse modeling. Methane observations from three in situ monitoring sites were assimilated into a Bayesian four‐dimensional variational inversion framework coupled with the Community Multiscale Air Quality model, employing prior emissions from the Open Methane Database (2024). Posterior results revealed increased emissions in the eastern region, particularly near gas infrastructure and wastewater facilities, suggesting that these sources may be underrepresented in prior inventories. In contrast, a consistent decline in methane emissions was observed across all months in the central‐western part of the domain, where coal mining and power generation are concentrated. This decline is likely linked to the predominance of brown coal in the region, which emits substantially less methane than black coal, a distinction not clearly captured in the study inventory, potentially leading to overestimated emissions. Additionally, the most significant reduction in the entire studied domain occurred in February 2019, with emissions decreasing by approximately 30% relative to prior estimates. Sensitivity analyses and comparisons with the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research inventory support the robustness of these findings. While total emissions across data sets were broadly similar, differences in spatial distribution led to notable variations in posterior outcomes. These results highlight the importance of incorporating local knowledge into emission inventories and the need for more detailed classification of emission sources, particularly coal type, to improve methane emission estimates at regional scales."

 Thetis cells (TCs) are a recently identified lineage of RORγt+ antigen-presenting cells comprising four subsets including a tolerogenic subset, TC IV, that instructs tolerance to gut microbiota and food antigens1–6. A developmental wave of TCs during early life creates a critical window of opportunity for establishing intestinal tolerance1,5. Yet the ontogeny of TCs and the cues shaping their abundance and heterogeneity remain unknown, limiting efforts to harness their therapeutic potential. Here we identify a population of RORγt+ progenitors, termed Thetis-Lymphoid Tissue inducer progenitors (TLP), that give rise to the immediate TC progenitor (TCP) and the Lymphoid Tissue inducer progenitor (LTiP), and identify PU.1 as the transcription factor governing TC fate. Despite transcriptional similarity to myeloid-derived conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), we show that TCs descend from the common lymphoid progenitor (CLP). Deletion of the plasmacytoid DC (pDC) lineage-determining transcription factor TCF4 expands TLPs and TCs, suggesting a shared developmental branch with pDCs. TLPs are enriched in fetal liver; however, unlike LTi cells, TCs emerge postnatally, pointing to developmentally-timed environmental cues that promote TCP differentiation. We identify one such cue–RANKL provision by lymphoid tissue organizer cells–which is essential for TC I differentiation. Together, these findings define the ontogeny of TCs and the transcription factors that promote TC differentiation and heterogeneity, facilitating future investigations of these enigmatic cells and their therapeutic potential for tolerance induction in food allergy and autoimmunity."

Bono,Mantle heterogeneity influenced Earth’s ancient magnetic field,"Earth’s core dynamo, which produces the magnetic field, may have been influenced by spatial variations in heat flux across the core–mantle boundary, according to combined palaeomagnetic datasets and geodynamo simulations. 
 Heat flowing from the core to the mantle drives the geodynamo that produces Earth’s global magnetic field. Palaeomagnetic measurements record the behaviour of this field through time and have the potential to inform us about deep Earth structures and dynamics on either side of the core–mantle boundary. In practise, insights have proved difficult to obtain because of the limited spatiotemporal resolution of palaeomagnetic records and uncertainties in how to interpret them. Here we use palaeomagnetic datasets and models alongside numerical simulations of the geodynamo to show that certain observed characteristics of ancient magnetic field behaviour are uniquely or preferentially reproduced in the presence of strong lateral variability in core–mantle heat flux. Our findings suggest that strong contrasts in the spatial pattern of the temperature gradients and/or thermal conductivity of the lowermost mantle that are linked, today, to seismologically observed structures, have influenced the geodynamo for at least the last few hundred million years. The identified palaeomagnetic signatures provide a new means to constrain the properties and time evolution of the core–mantle boundary. Furthermore, our insights into how thermal heterogeneity at the base of the mantle can break the axial symmetry of the time-averaged magnetic field may help resolve longstanding palaeogeographic controversies.

 Rising atmospheric CO2 reduces soil phosphorus (P) availability in paddy soils by promoting soil organic P accumulation and crop harvest removal. Atmospheric CO2 and temperatures are increasing simultaneously, yet their interaction with the soil P cycle remains unresolved. Here we report a decade-long free-air CO2 enrichment experiment integrated with in situ warming (+2 °C) in a typical paddy–upland rotation system. We find that both elevated CO2 and warming exacerbate P constraints, and that warming alone and in combination with elevated CO2 has a greater impact than elevated CO2 alone. All climate change treatments significantly depleted soil available P (32–54%) and increased the soil C:P ratios (4–30%). Moreover, warming initially accelerated P mineralization but reduced P availability by enhancing Fe–organic carbon complexes and microbial immobilization. These processes, together with increased crop P demand driven by accelerated growth under elevated CO2, exacerbate P depletion. We identify Fe–organic carbon interactions as a previously overlooked mechanism that significantly reduces P bioavailability. Our findings offer a mechanistic framework linking aboveground–belowground C–P coupling with microbially driven Fe–organic matter dynamics, highlighting the urgent need for adaptive nutrient management strategies to sustain rice production under future climate change.

Here, the authors apply click chemistry to derive copper complexes that induce DNA strand breaks in recalcitrant cancer cells, validating an innovative route for metallodrug design. 
 Recently, copper(I)-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) click chemistry has emerged as a promising approach for designing new artificial metallo-nucleases (AMNs) with DNA-damaging properties. By functionalising a central organic azide with three alkyne donors, Tri-Click (TC) ligands capable of chelating three copper ions through the donor group and triazole linker can be generated. However, the versatility of this approach along with the influence of specific donors on metal binding, DNA recognition, and cellular DNA damage in an anticancer context remains poorly understood. Here, we prepare a series of Tri-Click ligands incorporating systematic cyclic and acyclic N-, O-, and S-donors and evaluate their AMN activities. Screening experiments pinpoint planar N-donor ligands as high value agents. Among these, the copper complex of Tri-Click-Pyridine (Cu3-TC-Py) displays significant potential. We characterise its activity using single-molecule imaging, microscale thermophoresis, FRET-based binding assays, molecular dynamics, and intracellular DNA interaction studies in human and functional bacterial cells. We report the emergence of Cu3-TC-Py as a lead AMN with high reactivity for DNA damage applications central to anticancer therapy.

 The low quantitative accuracy of conventional small noncoding RNA sequencing (sncRNA-seq) methods due to extensive ligation bias commonly limits functional investigation of microRNAs (miRNAs) and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). Here, we develop 4NBoost, a single-tube sncRNA-seq protocol designed to minimize bias in the estimated absolute quantification of miRNA and piRNA transcripts through the incorporation of quantitative exogenous RNA spike-ins. With 4NBoost, we profile sncRNA expression across 20 murine tissues, 18 macaque tissues, and 24 widely used cell lines, as well as 4 Arabidopsis tissues, to establish a comprehensive quantitative reference atlas. Compared with existing small RNA databases, our data reveal substantial biases in miRNA abundance, strand selection, and tissue-specific expression at both individual and family levels. To further extend its utility, we employ machine learning to model and correct biases in conventional datasets, effectively recovering ground truth transcript abundances. All 4NBoost data and the accompanying bias-correction model are freely available via SmRNAQuant (http://wulg-lab.sibcb.ac.cn/SmRNAQuant/), a web-based repository for exploring sncRNA expression.

 Global heat stress is intensifying under climate change, yet the relative roles of natural and anthropogenic forcing remain insufficiently quantified. Here, we show that global heat stress trend, assessed with the Universal Thermal Climate Index, increases markedly over the past four decades, with 52% of land area experiencing rises in mean heat stress intensity and 67% showing increases in extreme heat stress days. We find that anthropogenic climate change overwhelmingly dominates these trends, with the land area it dominates nearly twice as large as that dominated by natural climate change. Anthropogenic climate change also results in pronounced spatial inequality in heat stress trends across different economies, with low-income economies experiencing a growth rate two to three times higher than that of high-income economies. These findings demonstrate that human-induced climate change is amplifying global heat stress while deepening existing spatial inequalities, underscoring the urgency of equitable climate change adaptation.

 Understanding ocean freshwater variability is key to assessing the global water cycle and climate change, but changes in freshwater storage and transport remain unclear. Here we show that the South Indian Ocean—a vital conduit for interocean exchange—has experienced the strongest freshening in the Southern Hemisphere since the 1960s. This freshening drives a southward expansion of the Indo-Pacific freshwater pool into the South Indian Ocean, where freshwater has increased by 6.5 ± 0.5% per decade, as indicated by the shrinking 35.3 psu isohaline. Strengthened Indonesian Throughflow and intensified Subtropical Gyre inflow are the primary causes. In the upper ~200 m, freshening follows a new subtropical pathway rather than the usual tropical route. These changes arise from wind shifts linked to the Hadley cell’s poleward expansion and a stronger Indonesian Throughflow, both driven by warm-pool warming. Ongoing warming will further expand the freshwater pool and broaden the subtropical pathway, affecting climate, interocean exchange and marine ecosystems. Ocean salinity could change as the climate warms.

Here the authors suggest practical steps that bring fully water-based peptide synthesis closer to reality. 
 Solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) is a primary source of peptides for structure–function studies in development of potential clinical, agricultural, veterinary or cosmetic applications. Despite its efficiency and scalability, SPPS produces unsustainable volumes of toxic waste and non-degradable solid supports. With regulatory changes now in effect to reduce solvent use, there is a pressing need for sustainable, water-based synthesis methods. Due to the aqueous insolubility of the commonly employed Nα-Fmoc-amino acids—the primary building blocks in SPPS—establishing water-based peptide synthesis protocols is extremely challenging. Here we show that amine salts of, for example, N-methylmorpholine or N,N,N-triethanolamine and Nα-Fmoc protected amino acids are water soluble at high concentrations. Activation with a pre-formed water-soluble activating agent enables high quality SPPS on a hydrophilic and biodegradable poly-ε-lysine-based solid support in aqueous solution without characteristic side reactions. The presented methodology provides a simple avenue to sustainable, scalable water-based chemical synthesis of peptides. The growing market demand for peptides is drawing more attention to their industrial synthetic procedures, which rely on large amounts of toxic solvents.

 Despite numerous proxy-based reconstructions of climate since the Last Glacial Maximum, spatial hydroclimate variability in the Chinese monsoon region remains enigmatic. Here, we examine four stalagmites from northern China that collectively provide a continuous, highly resolved multi-proxy record over the past 25.5 ka. δ18O records capture large-scale variations in Asian summer monsoon (ASM) circulation, whereas trace element ratios and δ13C reflect regional precipitation variability; both follow precessional rhythms. Chinese stalagmite δ18O exhibits a zonal tripolar pattern, reflecting moisture sources and transport pathways. During Termination I, a meridional tripolar spatial precipitation pattern emerged, driven by El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and mid-latitude westerlies dynamics. While precipitation peaked during the Middle Holocene, ASM circulation was strongest in the Early Holocene, a dipole hydrological pattern linked to residual Northern Hemisphere ice volume. A similar tripolar pattern re-emerged during the 4.2 ka event, suggesting a dominant role of ENSO in shaping this anomaly."

 The complex nature of extratropical air-sea coupling has hampered a detailed physical understanding of how the atmosphere responds to sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension (KOE) region. Departing from the conventional approach of examining the seasonal-mean response, this study focuses on how atmospheric latent heating structures in early winter are modulated by synoptic weather patterns, and how those weather patterns selectively respond to KOE SST anomalies. The results are based on high-resolution atmospheric model experiments (1/8 degree over the North Pacific, tapering to 1 degree over the rest of the globe). While three dominant synoptic weather patterns that enhance latent heating over the KOE region are identified, only one of them, corresponding to anticyclonic baroclinic wave, systematically responds to the imposed SST anomalies. Warm SST anomalies induce stronger updrafts, which enhance atmospheric latent heating and ultimately strengthen and anchor the anomalous anticyclone over the North Pacific. Because this anticyclonic baroclinic system occurs more frequently than other types of weather patterns and has the greatest sensitivity to KOE SST anomalies, it dominates the seasonal-mean atmospheric response. The results demonstrate that a synoptic view is needed for an improved understanding of the mechanisms governing the seasonal-mean atmospheric circulation response to KOE SST forcing."

Monteiro;Giang Tran;Matthew J. Gidden;Nadine Mengis,Carbon-climate feedback responses to spatial aerosol model implementation variations,"Carbon-climate feedback responses to spatial aerosol model implementation variations 
 Aerosols have played an important role in defining the climate over the historical period, due to their net cooling effect in the atmosphere. However, as their emissions are expected to decrease in upcoming decades, they will be associated with reduced cooling, i.e. future warming, of the planet. Despite their importance and high uncertainty associated with their radiative forcing, aerosols inclusion in simple climate models, impact models and carbon-based climate assessment metrics requires simplifications and assumptions. Typically, interactions between physical and biogeochemical processes are disregarded by such. By varying the spatial implementation of aerosols in an intermediate complexity model we explore the variability in Earth system responses under an ambitious mitigation scenario due to aerosols-radiation interactions. When aerosols are implemented disregarding their spatial distribution, surface air temperature is higher by almost 0.1 °C when compared to a regionally heterogeneous implementation, corresponding to an uncertainty of ca. 200 GtCO2 of remaining carbon budgets. The main processes driving these responses are the land surface temperature and its effect on soil respiration, as well as changed ocean heat fluxes due to differences in incoming shortwave radiation at the surface. The spatial distribution of aerosols triggers important climate-carbon feedbacks, which should be specifically considered when assessing climate evolution and simulated Earth system responses. Even if aerosol-cloud interactions aren’t explored, the results already indicate that aerosols should be deliberately accounted for in simple models and assessment tools, as their triggered feedbacks will be instrumental in defining pathways for temperature stabilisation and evaluating, for example, remaining carbon budgets."

 Since about 2000, the total mass of the Antarctic Ice Sheet has declined at a near-linear rate, increasing global sea levels. Since 2016, however, satellite gravimetry data reveal a slowdown in net Antarctic ice mass loss and a net mass gain since 2020, despite increases in dynamically-driven ice loss by discharge from outlet glaciers. Here we use a reanalysis and regional climate model to show that this reversal is primarily due to positive surface mass balance anomalies, which result from increased precipitation driven by enhanced atmospheric river activity, strengthened westerlies, and reduced sea ice extent. Atmospheric rivers have become more frequent and intense since 2020, particularly over the Antarctic Peninsula, Queen Maud Land, and Wilkes Land, resulting in strong regional positive mass balance anomalies. High-resolution regional climate model simulations with modified sea ice extent show that the effect of sea ice loss on enhancing precipitation through increased evaporation accounts for around 10% of the winter increase, but is overall minor compared to remote large-scale processes. Combined, these factors result in accumulation increases that currently offset the mass loss from accelerated ice discharge in Antarctica and point to processes important for future projections. The recent increase in Antarctic Ice Sheet mass is driven by enhanced precipitation from frequent atmospheric rivers, stronger westerlies, and reduced sea ice, which together offset ice loss from outlet glacier discharge, according to reanalysis and regional climate modelling."

 Land clearing in the Brazilian Amazon is strongly influenced by the economics of farming at the forest frontier. Here we examine how rising profits from second-season corn, grown after soybeans, may increase pressure on forests in the state of Mato Grosso. We assemble detailed annual data on crop prices, yields, production costs, land values, and forest loss, and construct measures of both per-hectare and regional-level profits from soybean and safrinha corn farming. Using statistical models designed to separate the effects of expected returns from the effects of profit-driven expansion, we show that increases in farm profits raise land prices and are followed by higher levels of forest clearing. These effects persist for several years after a shift in profits. Our results suggest that expanding corn production in frontier regions, by making farming more profitable, fuels land speculation and encourages the clearing of new land. In Mato Grosso, Brazil, an increase in profits from safrinha corn indirectly increases land values and forest loss, and these effects persist for several years after a shift in profits, according to an analysis that combines crop, cost, and yield data with a statistical model."

 The last deglaciation provides an opportunity to assess the response of El Niño–Southern Oscillation to rapid warming and disruptions of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, both projected in the near future. We present a reconstruction of deglacial El Niño–Southern Oscillation activity using finely laminated sediments from the El Niño–Southern Oscillation-sensitive Peruvian margin. An interannual record of titanium fluxes, a proxy for riverine discharge, shows that the frequency of extreme Eastern Pacific El Niño events and the amplitude of El Niño–Southern Oscillation variability were higher during the deglaciation and peaked during episodes of massive iceberg discharge into the North Atlantic. Maximum El Niño–Southern Oscillation variability occurred in the early phase of Heinrich event 1, at ~17.3–16.7 kyr BP, associated with at least five extreme floods per century in southern Peru.

 Fog formation over tropical forests remains poorly characterized, despite its potential role in bioaerosol dispersion and ecosystem processes. Here, we analyzed fog samples collected at the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory using flow cytometry and culture-based techniques to characterize viable microbial communities. Microbial cell concentrations varied over an order of magnitude across 13 fog events, reaching up to 8 × 104 cells per ml of fog water. Flow cytometry consistently detected metabolically active cells, while culturing and mass spectrometry-based identification yielded eight viable bacterial species and seven fungal taxa. The bacteria Serratia marcescens, Ralstonia pickettii and Sphingomonas paucimobilis exhibited seasonal variations in prevalence. The fungal species identified were primarily mesophilic saprophytes and endophytes, commonly associated with soil and plant surfaces. Our findings indicate that fog harbors viable microbes, including Serratia marcescens and Ralstonia pickettii, which may imply a relevance of fog for microbial dispersal, colonization and nutrient cycling in the Amazon rainforest.

 Lakes affect regional climate by influencing heat and moisture exchange and near-surface wind. However, their global impact on the atmospheric boundary layer, a key layer of land–atmosphere interaction, remains unclear. Here, we combine satellite-based atmospheric profiles with the fifth generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis to assess the impacts of large inland lakes (area greater than 500 square kilometers). Lakes enhance heat (1.6 degrees Celsius) and moisture (0.4 grams per kilogram) transport toward surrounding land, shifting low-level instability center to within 25 kilograms of the shoreline and strengthening turbulent mixing and convective development. Consequently, atmospheric boundary layer height over these lake-adjacent lands increases by 0.3 to 0.6 kilometers, while it remains lower over lakes because of stronger stratification. The dominant processes of lake effects vary with season, latitude, elevation and lake size. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating lake–atmosphere coupling into weather and climate models.

 Ultradeep drilling beyond nine to ten kilometers has progressed from an engineering challenge to a powerful approach for investigating deep Earth processes and subsurface resources. Early continental drilling showed that the deep crust is not cold or impermeable, but contains fluids, active heat flow, and ongoing chemical reactions. This review presents an integrated synthesis of scientific results from drilling that exceeds ten kilometers, with emphasis on recent Chinese programs. These wells document methane-rich fluids, high pressures, and high temperatures in sedimentary and crystalline rocks, indicating that hydrocarbon systems, deep fluids, and permeability persist far deeper than traditionally assumed. Integrating observations from cores, formation fluids, stress measurements, and geochemical analyses, we show that revised geothermal gradients, fault-controlled fluid pathways, and fluid–rock reactions such as serpentinization, carbonation, and hydrocarbon cracking sustain permeability at extreme depths. Ultradeep drilling thus provides insights into Earth system dynamics, deep energy resources, carbon storage, and mineral systems.

 Building height stands as a vital vertical representation of urban morphology and is closely linked to the development of sustainable cities. However, accurately mapping building heights over a wide area at a fine scale remains challenging due to the high costs of field data acquisition, the loss of spatial details in large-scale mapping, and the underestimation of high-rise buildings. To tackle these challenges, this study develops a novel Tri-Modal Height Estimation Network (TMHEN) and a Cross-modal Adaptive Enhancer (CAE) module. Leveraging SDGSAT-1 Glimmer imagery, Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Imager (MSI) and Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, building height maps with 10-m resolution were derived. The nighttime light (NTL) imagery of SDGSAT-1 is introduced for the first time in building height estimation. Trained on building height data collected from 61 cities nationwide, our model achieves a satisfactory accuracy, with the root mean square error ranging from 2.05 m to 7.87 m and a mean absolute error from 0.67 m to 2.71 m. Our results exhibit notable consistency with the reference data and outperform existing state of the art products in capturing rich spatial details. The incorporation of high-resolution NTL data effectively mitigates the underestimation primarily caused by SAR backscatter, reducing residuals by 13.01% and 17.98% compared to models utilizing lower-resolution NTL data or no NTL data, respectively. The proposed TMHEN is applied to five major Chinese urban agglomerations, revealing the diversity of urban vertical forms and distinct development patterns. The high-resolution building height maps provide scientific insights to the evaluation of SDG 11 indicators towards a more comprehensive understanding of urbanization processes.

 Accurate and transferable crop monitoring from remote sensing remains challenging because vegetation signals are strongly affected by phenological asynchrony, climatic variability, and sensor-specific responses. Existing approaches rely on local calibrated relationships , limiting their effectiveness in data-sparse regions. This study investigates whether models calibrated on high-quality localized reference data can generalize to other regions by stabilizing sensor–biophysical relationships.The proposed methodology integrates two components (i) thermal time normalization based on growing degree days (GDD) to reduce phenology-driven variability, and (ii) physically motivated optical and optical–SAR fusion indices designed within this normalized framework to enhance the consistency of learned relationships across contrasting environments.The approach was evaluated through within-region cross-season, and cross-region experiments. Results show that GDD normalization improves performance relative to calendar-based approaches by up to 35%. In cross-season validation, fusion-based linear models achieved R2 > 0.60 for wheat and 0.65 in barley. Cross-region validation shows reduced but meaningful transferability, with both crops reaching R2 ≈ 0.45, and fusion reducing RMSE by ∼ 200 kg ha-1 compared to optical-only models. Machine-learning models did not improve generalization over simple parametric fits.These findings confirm that stabilizing phenological and multi-sensor relationships is critical for transferring models from data-rich to data-limited areas, providing a foundation for scalable, global agricultural monitoring."

 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is crucial for Earth observation because it can acquire high-resolution images in all weather conditions. However, the presence of speckles—an inherent multiplicative noise caused by the coherent imaging process—severely degrades image quality and impairs the performance of subsequent interpretation tasks. To effectively capture both global contextual cues and fine-grained structural details in SAR image despeckling, we design a dual-branch Global-Local Collaborative Network (GLCNet) based on blind-spot convolution. GLCNet is trained in a self-supervised manner, requiring only original images for learning, making it well-suited for SAR data without ground truth. In the global branch, the SAR image is first decomposed into multiple frequency sub-bands through a Wavelet-Shuffle Downsampling (WSD), which decorrelates speckle components across scales and frequencies. A multi-scale blind-spot convolution is then applied to each sub-band in parallel, enabling the extraction of global textures without introducing speckle bias. In contrast, the local branch focuses on structure-aware restoration by jointly modeling frequency and spatial priors. By leveraging neighboring-pixel dependencies, this branch enhances local detail recovery and edge sharpness. Finally, an adaptive Detail-Guided Module (DGM) dynamically integrates complementary features from both branches, ensuring a harmonious balance between texture smoothness and structural fidelity. The proposed method is validated using various SAR sensors, including Sentinel-1, GF-3, TerraSAR-X, and Capella-X, demonstrating its superiority over traditional and deep learning approaches. Additionally, the application analysis confirms that the method enhances both the visual quality and analytical reliability of SAR images, making it a valuable preprocessing step for real-world scenarios.

 Real-world aerial image super-resolution (SR) remains particularly challenging because degradations in remote-sensing imagery involve random combinations of anisotropic blur, signal-dependent noise, and unknown downsampling kernels. Most existing SR methods either rely on simplified degradation assumptions or lack semantic perception of degradation, resulting in limited generalization to real-world conditions. To address these gaps, we propose a novel diffusion-based SR framework that integrates Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and self-supervised contrastive learning for extracting degradation-insensitive representation. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive learning strategy into a ControlNet module, where the HR and LR counterparts of the same image are regarded as positive pairs, while representations from different images serve as negative pairs, enabling the network to learn degradation-insensitive structural features. To further enhance semantic awareness of degradation, an MLLM-generated change caption is incorporated into the diffusion process as textual guidance, allowing the model to explicitly perceive and reconstruct different degradation types. Moreover, a classifier-free guidance (CFG) distillation strategy compresses the original dual-branch diffusion model into a single lightweight network, substantially improving inference efficiency while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity. Extensive experiments conducted on various datasets have showcased the superior performance of our proposed model compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our distillation algorithm achieves a twofold reduction in inference time compared to its non-distilled counterpart, making it more feasible for real-time and resource-limited applications."

 Soil bulk density (BD) is a key indicator of soil health and quality, influencing air and water fluxes in the soil, soil biology, plant growth, nutrient availability, and water retention. While BD is typically measured through field and lab methods, these are time-consuming and resource-intensive. Alternatively, researchers use pedotransfer functions and machine learning algorithms for BD prediction. Although several BD maps exist for Europe, Switzerland is often excluded due to its non-European Union member status, creating a data gap known as a “blank spot”. Additionally, existing Swiss BD maps have coarse spatial resolution (∼250 m). To address this, we used the national Swiss Soil Information System NABODAT dataset to produce high-resolution (30 m) BD maps at multiple depths (0, 30, 60, 100 cm) using a Quantile Random Forest algorithm. Using five-fold cross-validation, we obtained a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.57 and an R2 of 0.42, while external validation resulted in a CCC of 0.39 and an R2 of 0.36. The maps revealed that croplands had the highest BD, followed by grasslands and forests. Regionally, the Central Plateau and Jura exhibited higher BD compared to the Alps. BD increased with depth, and key predictors were depth, elevation, and temperature. Although we initially expected surface reflectance to be a relevant predictor due to its link with organic carbon, it showed low importance in our model. These maps provide valuable insights for national-scale applications such as soil carbon stock estimation and compaction assessment."

 Monitoring global vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP) at an hourly scale is critical for understanding terrestrial carbon dynamics, while recent global GPP products often suffer from limitations in their temporal resolutions. Here, a light use efficiency (LUE) model, integrated with FLUXNET and reanalysis datasets as meteorological inputs, was employed to obtain GPP at both 1-hourly and 6-hourly resolutions. We developed a downscaling algorithm that partitions 6-hourly GPP into 1-hourly estimates by weighting the 6-hourly values according to the hourly cosine of the solar zenith angle and applying linear regression. The algorithm was then applied to global 6-hourly reanalysis-driven GPP maps during 2001–2020. Using GPP simulated from 1-hourly meteorological inputs and eddy covariance (EC) GPP as references, the 6-hourly resolution GPP before and after downscaling were evaluated by mean-absolute-deviation (MAD) and nash–sutcliffe-efficiency (NSE). At 150 sites, results showed that the 6-hourly FLUXNET-driven and reanalysis-driven GPP after downscaling exhibited a significantly stronger correlation (MAD = 0.03 gCm−2h−1, NSE = 0.95) with corresponding 1-hourly estimates than the 6-hourly GPP estimates before downscaling (MAD = 0.06 gCm−2h−1, NSE = 0.83). Compared to EC GPP, the 6-hourly GPP estimates after downscaling also achieved notable improvements, with a MAD lower by 0.02 gCm−2h−1 and an NSE higher by 0.09. At the global scale, the mean annual bias in total GPP summed from 6-hourly reanalysis-driven maps, decreased from 4.14 gCyr−1 before downscaling to 0.53 gCyr−1 after downscaling over the period 2001–2020, as compared with corresponding 1-hourly GPP maps. At the hourly scale, the mean relative error between the 6-hourly and corresponding 1-hourly GPP maps decreased from 32.40% before downscaling to 18.49% after downscaling. This downscaling algorithm effectively reduces biases in global GPP estimates, which could offer valuable insights into carbon modeling at finer temporal resolutions."

 Ozone (O3) exceedances of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) frequently occur during summer in New York City (NYC) and downwind coastal areas of Long Island Sound (LIS), driven by complex interactions among urban emissions, regional transport, land–sea breezes, and urban heat island effects. This study combines airborne, shipborne, and ground-based observations to examine spatiotemporal variations in mixing-layer height (MLH) and O3, using data from NASA's airborne lidar High Altitude Lidar Observatory (HALO), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Langley's ozone lidar, a shipborne ceilometer, CCNY ground-based aerosol lidar, coherent Doppler wind lidar, and ground in situ samplers during the Long Island Sound Tropospheric Ozone Study (LISTOS). Compared with the NYC urban area, near-surface O3 at western and eastern LIS coastal sites was consistently higher, exceeding the NAAQS on August 28–29, 2018 despite low-level nitrogen dioxide (NO2). During morning-to-noon planetary boundary layer (PBL) growth, MLH reached 1.6–1.8 km over NYC but remained lower (0.8–1.0 km) over LIS and New Jersey suburbs. Comparisons of ground lidar and ceilometer data revealed a 1–2-h lag in MLH growth over coastal-marine areas relative to the NYC urban core, due to urban heat island effects (UHI). These results indicate that coastal O3 exceedances are linked to shallow MLH, urban plume transport, and sea-breeze circulations. Observations were used to evaluate NOAA North American Mesoscale (NAM)- EPA Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model forecasts of MLH and surface O3. While model performed well at the urban site, a timing bias in coastal peak O3 was identified, highlighting challenges in predicting coastal air quality."

 Both organic bases and oxidized organic molecules (OOMs) play crucial roles as precursors in new particle formation (NPF). The atmospheric oxidation products of aniline exhibit characteristics of both organic bases and OOMs. This study utilizes theoretical calculations to explore the atmospheric oxidation of aniline during both day and night, revealing the mechanisms of OOM formation and their role in nucleation. During the day, aniline oxidation initiated by hydroxyl radicals predominantly follows two pathways: the bicyclic peroxy radical and imine pathways. OOMs originating from these pathways readily associate with sulfuric acid to form stable clusters, contributing to the initial stages of particle nucleation. Intermolecular interactions reveal that the strong nucleation ability of OOMs results from the synergistic effect between basic and oxygen-containing functional groups in their molecular structures. At night, aniline oxidation is primarily driven by NO3 radicals. The nucleation potential of the resulting OOMs and organic nitrates (ONs) is significantly reduced due to their lower oxidation levels, fewer hydrogen-bonding sites and the inclusion of nitrate ester groups. In high-NOx environments, processes involving RO2 radicals and NO inhibit the generation of highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs), reducing their contribution to NPF. In low-NOx environments, NO promotes the generation of open-ring HOMs that readily cluster with sulfuric acid, thereby participating in nucleation. This study elucidates the oxidation mechanisms of aniline that lead to the formation of OOMs and ONs, as well as their initial clustering with sulfuric acid, offering deeper insight into how aromatic compounds and organic bases facilitate NPF."

 Anhydrides are widely used in industrial processes. Propionic anhydride (PA) and butyric anhydride (BA) are considered to be high production volume chemicals, with a total production in the order of thousands of tonnes. This study presents the rate coefficients for PA and BA with chlorine atoms for the first time: (3.8 ± 0.8) × 10−12 and (11 ± 2) × 10−12 cm3 molecule−1 s−1, respectively. The rate coefficients for the reactions of PA and BA with •OH radicals were estimated using Linear-Free-Energy-Relationships (LFER): 3.5 × 10−13 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 and 7.9 × 10−13 cm3 molecule−1 s−1, respectively. From here, the calculated atmospheric lifetimes (33 and 15 days, for PA and BA, respectively) indicate that, once emitted, they could be transported by air masses having a regional impact.Moreover, the main photooxidation products, both in the presence and absence of NO2 were identified by infrared spectroscopy: CH3CH2C(O)OH, CH3CH2C(O)OC(O)C(O)CH3, CH3CH2C(O)OC(O)CH2C(O)H, CH3C(O)C(O)OONO2, CH3C(O)OONO2 and CO2 for PA; and CH3CH2CH2C(O)OH, CH3CH2CH2C(O)OC(O)CH2CH2C(O)H, CH3CH2CH2C(O)OC(O)CH2C(O)H, CH3CH2C(O)OONO2, CH3CH2C(O)C(O)OONO2 and CO2 for BA. Computational studies were used to support the experimental identification of the products.Atmospheric degradation of PA and BA produces carboxylic acids that can partition into the aqueous phase of clouds and fog, affecting atmospheric processes having environmental impacts. In addition, the degradation of PA and BA in regions polluted with nitrogen dioxide leads to the formation of peroxyacyl nitrates, which can be transported long distances from their source of production, polluting remote areas."

 Arctic aerosols play an important role in modulating high-latitude weather and climate. However, spatiotemporal aerosol distributions in the Arctic remain poorly quantified. Here, we present aerosol physicochemical properties observed during the Cold Air Outbreak Experiment in the Sub-Arctic Region (CAESAR) campaign. The airborne measurements covered a wide vertical range, from the near-surface to the free troposphere, across remote regions between Scandinavia and the coast of Greenland. A merged particle distribution product, spanning from 10 nm to 3 μm in diameter, was developed by combining a suite of five aerosol sensors. Number closure was achieved between the different instruments. Estimated aerosol concentration from the merged size distribution varied between ∼50 and ∼ 700 scm−3. Refractory black carbon mass concentrations (70–800 nm) varied between ∼0.9 and ∼ 80.4 ng sm−3. Aerosol mass concentration observations were compared to the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System composition forecast (GEOS-CF). The model concentrations correlated with the observations exhibit agreement with the spatial and temporal distribution of localized black carbon aerosol plumes. During Research Flight (RF) 09, the black carbon mass concentration model-vs-observation Pearson correlation coefficient r is 0.84. Observed fine particulate matter (PM2.5) were significantly larger than the model concentrations within the marine boundary layer (MBL). The high observed PM2.5 concentrations were due to coarse mode aerosol, suggesting that the model did not accurately capture sea-spray production. Over the study domain, the median normalized mean bias (NMB) was −2454% and the normalized mean root square error (NMRSE) was 35% for PM2.5; and 1372% (10,619%) and 90% (177%) for refractory black carbon within the marine boundary layer (free troposphere), respectively. The dataset and data/model intercomparison provide new constraints for understanding aerosol properties in the Arctic region."

 Accurate tropical cyclone (TC) intensity estimation can improve the effectiveness of numerical forecasts of TC intensity. The similarity between the TC categories and the significant differences within each category make this task highly challenging. In TC intensity estimation, the most discriminative features are in the center region of the TC. The limitations of existing methods are from their failure to effectively capture both local and global feature simultaneously. In this paper, a hybrid network is proposed in which Weight Aggregated Convolution adaptively adjusts kernel weights to capture local features, while linear attention is used to model global dependencies. In addition, a wavelet transform convolution layer is added to improve frequency domain sensitivity for more efficient feature extraction and comprehensive data understanding. The proposed WAWL-Net model effectively integrates local structural details and global contextual dependencies for TC intensity estimation, significantly improving the model's ability to accurately estimate the TC intensity with lower computational complexity. The effectiveness of our network was validated using multi-channel (IR, WV, PMW) channel data on the TCIR benchmark, where it achieved state-of-the-art performance."

 By combining geostationary satellite observations, cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning detections, and radar composite reflectivity (CR) mosaics, this study investigates the intensity, evolution, and distribution of CG lightning and CR associated with mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). A total of 551 MCSs are identified in central-eastern China during May–September of 2018–2021 using Fengyun-4 A satellite brightness temperature (BT) data and subsequently matched with CG lightning and CR mosaics. The geographical analysis of CG lightning associated with MCSs reveals that the highest occurrences are most frequent in the transition zone between the Poyang Lake Plain and the surrounding mountains. The proportion of negative-polarity flashes is relatively lower in MCS-related CG lightning than in total CG lightning. An overall negative correlation between BT and the peak current of CG lightning is observed with seasonal variations. The positive correlations detected in May and September may be attributed to the advection of ice particles from convective cores into adjacent stratiform regions, driven by stronger mid-to-upper-level winds. The peak occurrence of CG lightning precedes the maximum MCS extent by 0–2 h. As the MCS develops, the proportion of convective clouds decreases, while that of non-precipitating anvil increases, and the stratiform regions consistently account for 50%–60% of the total MCS extent, dominating throughout its lifespan. The stratiform region is predominantly located in the southern part of the MCS, whereas convective clouds are mainly situated in the northern part, possibly influenced by the Meiyu front."

 As an air pollutant and atmospheric oxidant, tropospheric ozone (O3) is also recognized as a significant greenhouse gas and a key radiatively active species in the atmosphere. In this study, we examine the impact of tropospheric ozone–radiation interactions, explicitly quantifying the effects of meteorological feedback (TrO3-Met) and photolysis feedback (TrO3-Phot) on near-surface O3 concentrations over eastern China in June by using the WRF-Chem model embedded with improved process analysis scheme. A ten-year averaged simulation from 2010 to 2019 is conducted to improve the representativeness of quantified contributions of TrO3-Met and TrO3-Phot. Results show that TrO3-Met increases O3 concentrations by an average of +0.1 μg·m−3 over eastern China, with more pronounced effects over the North China Plain (NCP, +0.4 μg·m−3), the Yangtze River Delta (YRD, +0.5 μg·m−3), and the Pearl River Delta (PRD +0.1 μg·m−3), and the enhanced vertical mixing from aloft to the lower level is the dominant process contributing to the elevated O3 levels. TrO3-Phot reduces daytime ozone photolysis rate (J[O1D]) by 34.5% and OH radical concentrations by 21.0%, resulting in 1.0% reduction (−1.0 μg·m−3) in surface O3 over eastern China, with more substantial reductions over the NCP (−7.8%), YRD (−6.4%), and PRD (−4.2%). The intensified chemical removal process is primarily responsible for the overall decline. Further analysis of O3-related gas-phase chemical reactions based on integrated reaction rate reveals that weakened HOx-driven oxidation increases the participation of tropospheric O3 in alternative oxidation pathways, resulting in a negative net O3 production rate, thereby explaining the reduction in surface O3 concentrations."

 Southwest China, characterized by complex topography and pronounced land surface heterogeneity, demands high-quality precipitation data for land surface processes monitoring and modeling. However, the quality of existing gridded precipitation products in this region remains unclear. Using high-density meteorological station observations from 525 national stations and 13,713 regional stations covering 2016–2020, this study comprehensively evaluates eight mainstream gridded precipitation products, including three satellite-based (GSMaP-Gauge, IMERG-Final, GSMaP-Mvk), two model-based (ERA5, ERA5-Land), and three merged (MSWEP, CMFD, GLDAS) products. Results suggest that: (1) none of the products possess satisfactory performance (KGE < 0) over the entire region, and the uncertainty in precipitation estimation—reflected by inter-product discrepancies—increases significantly (from ∼150 mm/y to ∼400 mm/y) with terrain complexity (from ∼25 m to ∼1000 m of sub-grid heterogeneity); (2) all products can reasonably capture seasonal variability but fail to characterize extremely heavy and light rainfall events, and model-based products exhibit relatively better precipitation detection capability (e.g., with POD >0.90 and CSI > 0.50 for ERA5 and ERA5-Land); (3) while most products exhibit relatively favorable consistency with observations from national stations, their performance is remarkably degraded over regional stations (e.g., monthly KGE values decrease from >0.50 to <0 for all products). Additional analyses reveal that model-based products (e.g., ERA5 and ERA5-Land) can better depict the spatial distribution of precipitation in complex and sparsely monitored regions, and the incorporation of gauge observations can further mitigate abovementioned uncertainties (e.g., with Bias <60 mm/y and RMSE <345 mm/y for GSMaP-Gauge and MSWEP)."

 Monsoon systems underpin the water, food, and economic security of over two-thirds of the global population, yet they are entering a state of instability as global temperatures have now surpassed +1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. This crossing of the 1.5 °C threshold raises a critical problem: Are monsoon onset, duration, and extreme rainfall already shifting in detectable, regionally differentiated ways? Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 framework, we screened 784 peer-reviewed studies (2000–2024) and synthesized 72 high-quality articles. A complementary global diagnostic using Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS; 1981–2024) ensured uniform comparison across monsoon regions. Results reveal onset shifts of ±15 days, rainfall-intensity increases of +10–60%, and duration changes of ±15 days, with the strongest signals in South Asia, East Asia, the Western North Pacific, and Southeast Asia. Attribution using CMIP5/CMIP6, ERA5, TRMM, GPM, and IMERG identifies El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), sea-surface temperature anomalies, and greenhouse-gas (GHG)–aerosol interactions as dominant drivers. Although seasonal totals often change modestly, clustering of extremes and lengthening dry spells markedly elevate compound flood–drought risk. This review establishes the first harmonized global baseline of observed monsoon change and highlights urgent needs for convection-permitting regional models, improved subseasonal prediction, expanded observational networks, and increased representation of African and South American monsoon systems."
