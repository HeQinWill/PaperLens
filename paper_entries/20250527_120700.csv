10.5194/acp-25-5287-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要探讨了2000年至2018年期间，不同区域和行业的氮氧化物（NOx）和活性碳排放源对全球对流层臭氧变化趋势的影响。通过模拟不同排放源对全球对流层臭氧总量的贡献，研究发现人为源的氮氧化物排放，特别是来自热带地区的排放，对臭氧总量及其变化趋势起着重要作用。论文还分析了不同区域人为排放对臭氧产生效率的影响，并指出人口密集地区人为排放的增加是全球人口加权平均臭氧浓度上升的主要驱动因素。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术或卫星观测，但其研究内容与大气环境监测、空气质量评估以及大气成分分析密切相关，这些领域通常会利用遥感技术。,"['tropospheric ozone', 'NOx emissions', 'reactive carbon emissions', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'global trends', 'source attribution']",Aditya Nalam;Aura Lupaşcu;Tabish Ansari;Tim Butler,Regional and sectoral contributions of  NOx and reactive carbon emission sources to global trends in tropospheric ozone during the 2000–2018 period,"Tropospheric O3 molecules are labeled with the identity of their precursor source to simulate contributions from various emission sources to the global tropospheric O3 burden (TOB) and its trends. With an equatorward shift, anthropogenic NOx emissions become significantly more efficient at producing O3 and play a major role in driving TOB trends, mainly due to larger convection at the tropics effectively lifting O3 and its precursors to the free troposphere, where O3 lifetime is longer. 
 Over the past few decades, the tropospheric ozone precursor anthropogenic emissions – nitrogen oxides (NOx) and reactive carbon (RC) from northern mid-/high-latitude regions (e.g., North America, Europe) – have been decreasing, and those from (sub-)tropical regions (e.g., South Asia , the Middle East ) have been increasing, leading to an equatorward emission redistribution. In this study, we quantify the contributions of various sources of NOx and RC emissions to tropospheric ozone using a source attribution technique during the 2000–2018 period in a global chemistry transport model. We tag the ozone molecules with the source of their NOx or RC precursor emission in two separate simulations: NOx-tagged and RC-tagged. These tags include various natural (biogenic, biomass burning, lightning NOx and RC from methane oxidation) and regional anthropogenic precursor emission sources and influx from the stratosphere. We simulate ∼336 Tg O3 of tropospheric ozone burden (TOB) with an increasing trend of 0.91 Tg O3 yr−1 (0.28 % yr−1), largely contributed (and trend driven) by anthropogenic NOx emissions and methane oxidation. The ozone production efficiency of regional anthropogenic NOx emissions increases when emissions decrease (e.g., Europe, North America) and decreases when emissions increase (e.g., South Asia, Middle East, international shipping). Tropical regions, despite lower emissions, contribute more to TOB compared to emissions from higher latitudes, consistent with previous work, predominantly due to large convection (combined with intense sunlight and larger reaction rates) at the tropics, thereby lifting O3 and its precursor molecules into the free troposphere where ozone's lifetime is longer. We simulate a smaller relative contribution from tropical regions to the global mean surface ozone compared to their contribution to the TOB. The global population-weighted mean ozone  is much larger compared to global mean surface ozone, mainly due to large anthropogenic emissions from densely populated regions – East Asia, South Asia and other tropical regions – and a substantial contribution from international ship NOx emissions. The increasing trends in anthropogenic precursor emissions from these regions are the main drivers of increasing global population-weighted mean ozone."
10.5194/acp-25-5233-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究探讨了广州城市绿地排放的生物源挥发性有机物（BVOCs）对臭氧污染的影响。研究使用WRF-MEGAN和CMAQ模型模拟了城市绿地的BVOC排放，并评估了这些排放对城市臭氧浓度的影响。结果表明，城市绿地的BVOC排放显著影响了城市臭氧水平，尤其是在污染期间。该研究强调了在城市规划中考虑城市绿地对空气质量的潜在影响的重要性。虽然没有直接提到遥感技术或卫星观测，但该研究涉及大气成分分析和空气质量监测，这些领域通常与遥感技术密切相关，因此可以认为与大气环境遥感技术有较强的关联性。,"['ozone pollution', 'biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs)', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'urban green spaces (UGSs)', 'WRF-MEGAN model', 'CMAQ model']",Haofan Wang;Yuejin Li;Yiming Liu;Xiao Lu;Yang Zhang;Qi Fan;Chong Shen;Senchao Lai;Yan Zhou;Tao Zhang;Dingli Yue,Underappreciated contributions of biogenic volatile organic compounds from urban green spaces to ozone pollution,"This study explores how urban green spaces (UGSs) in Guangzhou influence ozone levels. By using advanced models, we found that natural emissions from these areas can significantly affect air quality. Our results suggest that the design and planning of UGSs should not only consider aesthetics and social factors but also their environmental impacts on air quality. 
 The use of urban green spaces (UGSs), such as parks and gardens, is widely promoted as a strategy to improve the urban atmospheric environment. However, this study reveals that it can exacerbate urban ozone (O3) levels under certain conditions, as demonstrated by a September 2017 study in Guangzhou, China. Using the Weather Research and Forecasting model with the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (WRF-MEGAN) and the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, we assessed the impact of UGS-related biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions (hereafter referred to as UGS-BVOC emissions) on urban O3. Our findings indicate that the UGS-BVOC emissions in Guangzhou amounted to 666 Gg (∼90Mgkm-2), with isoprene (ISOP) and monoterpene (TERP) contributing remarkably to the total UGS-BVOC emissions. Compared to anthropogenic VOC (AVOC) and BVOC emissions, UGS-BVOC emissions account for ∼33.45 % in the city center, and their inclusion in the model reduces ISOP underestimation. The study shows improved simulation mean biases for MDA8 (maximum daily 8 h average) O3, from −3.63 to −0.75 ppb in the city center.  Integrating UGS-BVOC emissions and UGS-LUCC emissions (where LUCC denotes land use cover change) enhances surface monthly mean O3 by 1.7–3.7 ppb (+3.8%-8.5%) and adds up to 8.9 ppb (+10.0 %) to MDA8 O3 during pollution episodes. UGS-BVOC emissions alone increase monthly mean O3 by 1.0–1.4 ppb (+2.3%-3.2%) in urban areas and contribute up to 2.9 ppb (+3.3 %) to MDA8 O3 during pollution episodes. These impacts can extend to surrounding suburban and rural areas through regional transport, highlighting the need to accurately account for UGS-BVOC emissions to better manage air quality."
10.5194/acp-25-5251-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究探讨了气溶胶在不同大气条件下如何影响从层积云向积云的转变过程。研究结合大涡模拟（LES）和弱温度梯度（WTG）参数化，模拟了气溶胶注入对云层的影响，并考虑了大规模环流的调整。结果表明，气溶胶的注入通常会抑制降水并增加云高，但当考虑由气溶胶增强引起的下沉变化时，其影响会发生改变。研究发现，如果忽略这些大气变化，可能会高估气溶胶的冷却效应。该研究与大气环境遥感技术相关，因为它涉及气溶胶对云层和大气的影响，这些影响可以通过卫星观测和大气成分分析进行监测和评估。,"['Aerosol effects on clouds', 'Stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition (SCT)', 'Cloud microphysics and macrophysics', 'Large-scale circulation', 'Aerosol cooling effects', 'Cloud-top height', 'Precipitation suppression', 'Entrainment', 'Subsidence', 'Sea-salt aerosols']",Je-Yun Chun;Robert Wood;Peter N. Blossey;Sarah J. Doherty,Impact on the stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition of the interaction of cloud microphysics and macrophysics with large-scale circulation,"This study explores how aerosols affect clouds transitioning from stratocumulus to cumulus along trade winds under varying atmospheric conditions. We found that aerosols typically reduce precipitation and raise cloud height, but their impact changes when subsidence changes by aerosol enhancement are considered. Our findings indicate that the cooling effect of aerosols might be overestimated if these atmospheric changes are not accounted for. 
 This study examines the impact of the interaction of cloud microphysics and macrophysics with the large-scale circulation on the stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition (SCT) using a large-eddy simulation (LES) combined with weak-temperature-gradient (WTG) parameterization. The WTG approximates large-scale circulation by inducing domain-mean subsidence to counter buoyancy perturbations relative to a reference thermodynamic profile. A stationary sea-salt sprayer perturbs transitioning clouds over a Lagrangian domain.Results show that the cloud response to aerosol injection differs significantly depending on whether stratified adjustments in the large-scale circulation in response to buoyancy perturbations are considered. Aerosol injection suppresses precipitation and enhances entrainment in both cases. Additionally, reduced surface sensible heat flux by precipitation suppression weakens boundary layer turbulence. Without the WTG, cloud-top height rises without a compensating adjustment in subsidence, delaying drizzle-induced stratocumulus thinning (“drizzle-depletion” feedback) by several days.With the WTG, intensified subsidence restrains cloud-top growth and accelerates stratocumulus thinning, leading to reduced boundary layer turbulence by weakened longwave cloud-top cooling and increased susceptibility to cloud breakup. For lightly precipitating clouds, aerosol injection accelerates the SCT by enhancing cloud thinning through warming driven by increased entrainment (“deepening–warming” mechanism). For heavily precipitating clouds, where the SCT is dominated by drizzle-depletion feedback, aerosol injection delays the SCT marginally as intensified subsidence amplifies the deepening–warming mechanism.These findings suggest that ignoring large-scale circulation adjustments in limited-domain models may overestimate aerosol cooling effects by ∼15–30 W m−2."

Grabowski;Hanna Pawlowska,Technical note: Phase space depiction  of cloud condensation nuclei activation  and cloud droplet diffusional growth,"A simple diagram to depict cloud droplets' formation via the activation of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) as well as their subsequent growth and evaporation is presented. 
 A novel way to represent cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation and cloud droplet growth by the diffusion of water vapor is introduced. The key is to apply a phase space diagram that plots the radius of a liquid droplet (deliquesced CCN or cloud droplet) versus the difference between the ambient supersaturation and the equilibrium supersaturation corresponding to the droplet radius. The latter combines the droplet and environmental characteristics, and it determines whether a droplet grows or evaporates. The diagram can be used to depict (in a straightforward way) key microphysical processes of CCN activation and deactivation as well as haze or cloud droplet transition from growth to evaporation. To show its utility, the diagram is applied to an idealized simulation of CCN activation and cloud droplet growth inside a rising turbulent air parcel and to simulations of microphysical processes inside a laboratory apparatus, the Pi cloud chamber. The adiabatic parcel mimics microphysical processes near the base of a natural cumulus or stratocumulus cloud. The Pi chamber simulations represent microphysical transformations in moist turbulent Rayleigh–Bénard convection with CCN proceeding through cycles of activation, growth, evaporation, and deactivation. A more general version of the phase diagram that is independent of the CCN dry radius is also developed. The phase diagram allows simple interpretations of key microphysical processes and highlights differences between droplet formation in natural and laboratory clouds."

AEH retrievals are only performed when aerosol optical depth is larger than 0.3. The retrieval results show significant estimations by comparing the aerosol height from the Cloud–Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization and the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument. 
 An algorithm for aerosol effective height (AEH) was developed for operational use with observations from the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS). The retrieval technique uses the slant column density of the oxygen dimer (O2–O2) at 477 nm, which is converted into AEH after retrieval of aerosol and surface optical properties from GEMS operational algorithms. The retrieved AEHs provide continuous vertical information on severe dust plumes over East Asia with reasonably good validation results and the collection of plume height information for anthropogenic aerosol pollutants over India. Compared to the AEH retrieved from Cloud–Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), the retrieval results show a bias of −0.03 km with a standard deviation of 1.4 km for the AEH difference over the GEMS observation domain from January to June 2021. The AEH difference depends on aerosol optical properties and surface reflectance. Compared to the aerosol layer height obtained from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), differences of 1.50±1.08 km, 1.59±1.22 km, and 1.71±1.24 km were obtained for pixels with single-scattering albedo (SSA) <0.90, 0.90 < SSA < 0.95, and SSA > 0.95, respectively."

 We present the first large-sample catchment hydrology dataset for Aotearoa New Zealand with hourly time series: the Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-Sample Studies – Aotearoa New Zealand (CAMELS-NZ). This dataset provides hourly hydrometeorological time series and comprehensive landscape attributes for 369 catchments across Aotearoa New Zealand, ranging from 1972 to 2024. Hourly records include streamflow, precipitation, temperature, relative humidity and potential evapotranspiration, with more than 65 % of streamflow records exceeding 40 years in length. CAMELS-NZ offers a rich set of static catchment attributes that quantify physical characteristics such as land cover, soil properties, geology, topography, and human impacts, including information on abstractions, dams, groundwater or snowmelt influences, as well as on ephemeral rivers. Aotearoa New Zealand's remarkable gradients in climate, topography, and geology give rise to diverse hydroclimatic landscapes and hydrological behaviours, making CAMELS-NZ a unique contribution to large-scale hydrological studies. Furthermore, Aotearoa New Zealand’s hydrology is defined by highly permeable volcanic catchments, sediment-rich alpine rivers with glacial contributions, and steep, rainfall-driven fast-rising rivers, providing opportunities to study diverse hydrological processes and rapid hydrological responses. CAMELS-NZ adheres to the standards established by most previously published CAMELS datasets, enabling international comparison studies. The dataset fills a critical gap in global hydrology by representing a Pacific Island environment with complex hydrological processes. This dataset supports a wide range of hydrological research applications, including model development and climate impact assessments, predictions in ungauged basins and large-sample comparative studies. The open-access nature of CAMELS-NZ ensures broad usability across multiple research domains, providing a foundation for national water resource and flood management, as well as international hydrological research.

In a validation case study using daily maximum near-surface air temperature (Tmax), the method works well and produces predictive distributions with closely matching theoretical versus actual coverage levels. Application of the method reveals that the magnitude of uncertainty in interpolated Tmax varies significantly in both space and time. 
 Uncertainty is inherent in gridded meteorological data, but this fact is often overlooked when data products do not provide a quantitative description of prediction uncertainty. This paper describes, applies, and evaluates a method for quantifying prediction uncertainty in spatially interpolated estimates of meteorological variables. The approach presented here, which we will refer to as DNK for “detrend, normal score, krige”, uses established methods from geostatistics to produce not only point estimates (i.e., a single number) but also predictive distributions for each location. Predictive distributions quantitatively describe uncertainty in a manner suitable for propagation into physical models that take meteorological variables as inputs. We apply the method to interpolate daily maximum near-surface air temperature (Tmax) and then validate the uncertainty quantification by comparing theoretical versus actual coverage of prediction intervals computed at locations where measurement data were held out from the estimation procedure. We find that, for most days, the predictive distributions accurately quantify uncertainty and that theoretical versus actual coverage levels of prediction intervals closely match one another. Even for days with the worst agreement, the predictive distributions meaningfully convey the relative certainty of predictions for different locations in space. After validating the methodology, we demonstrate how the magnitude of prediction uncertainty varies significantly in both space and time. Finally, we examine spatial correlation in predictions and errors using conditional Gaussian simulation to sample from the joint spatial predictive distribution. In summary, this work demonstrates the efficacy and value of describing uncertainty in gridded meteorological data products using predictive distributions."

We discuss multiple options and demonstrate that using GPUs makes more accurate simulations feasible. 
 The cryosphere plays a crucial role in the Earth's climate system, making accurate sea-ice simulation essential for improving climate projections. To achieve higher-resolution simulations, graphics processing units (GPUs) have become increasingly appealing due to their higher floating-point peak performance compared to central processing units (CPUs). However, harnessing the full theoretical performance of GPUs often requires significant effort in redesigning algorithms and careful implementation. Recently, several frameworks have emerged that aim to simplify general-purpose GPU programming. In this study, we evaluate multiple such frameworks, including CUDA, SYCL, Kokkos, and PyTorch, for the parallelization of neXtSIM-DG, a finite-element-based dynamical core for sea ice. Based on our assessment of usability and performance, CUDA demonstrates the best performance while Kokkos is a suitable option for its robust heterogeneous computing capabilities. Our complete implementation of the momentum equation using Kokkos achieves a 6-fold speedup on the GPU compared to our OpenMP-based CPU code, while maintaining competitiveness when run on the CPU. Additionally, we explore the use of lower-precision floating-point types on the GPU, showing that switching to single precision can further accelerate sea-ice codes."

Focusing on small gas molecule adsorption, we showcased novel data-centric methods to improve data set quality for adsorption modeling. First, we for the first time showed that solute descriptors could be used as features for gas molecules to increase data quality by merging smaller data sets into larger ones. This approach enabled the development of satisfactory predictive models for chlorofluorocarbons/hydrochlorofluorocarbons and hydrocarbon gas molecules for the first time. Then, we showed that mostly overlooked experimental measurements (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller, BET adsorption curves) enriched the data set quality by providing more detailed characterizations for adsorbents. New models including these curves for CO2 and CH4 reduced mean-squared errors (MSE) by approximately 18%. We also raised attention to data skewness’s impact on model performance. Last, we developed a new method for “actively” building suitable data sets for modeling, which aligned with results by the posterior method but without requiring training models in advance.

Howard Fairbrother,Tunable NPK Release from Surface-Esterified Nanocellulose-Based Prills,"Polysaccharides represent an ideal delivery platform for agrochemicals due to their biodegradability, biocompatibility, and abundance. However, hydrophilicity renders native polysaccharides ineffective at controlling the release of water-soluble agrochemicals. To overcome this limitation, we used a solvent-free, vapor-phase modification strategy to generate hydrophobic shells on the surface of nanofibrillated cellulose (CNF) prills and evaluated the effects of these tunable diffusion barriers on fertilizer release behavior. Hydrophobic shells of different thicknesses were created on CNF prills by esterification with acyl chlorides of varying alkyl chain lengths, although esterification did not hinder the inherent biodegradability of the CNFs. Fertilizer release rates were largely invariable to pH and NPK loading but were tunable over 3 orders of magnitude by varying the alkyl chain length and the degree of substitution (i.e., shell thickness). However, NPK release rates did not increase monotonically with increasing shell thickness; for long-chain (6 carbons or longer) esters, increases in shell thickness beyond optimal values increased release rates; SEM revealed that this originated from the introduction of fractures to the prills which act as diffusion channels. This work demonstrates the potential of controlled surface modification to generate a mineralizable and tunable NPK release platform from naturally sourced and sustainable feedstocks."

Unlike perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), FASAs can be transformed by microorganisms in the environment, producing fluorinated intermediates that eventually form stable PFAAs. A key difference of FASAs is that their pKas enable them to exist as neutral species or zwitterions, unlike all other PFAS subclasses, which are all anions. Sorption processes regulate the bioavailability of FASAs to microorganisms for transformation, driving the environmental transport and fate of FASAs. In this critical review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the classification, properties, and environmental fate of FASAs, with a focus on sorption and microbial transformation. We discuss recent advancements in understanding the sorption of FASAs onto soil, sediment, and microbial biomass, including key sorption descriptors and influencing factors. Additionally, we examine the microbial biotransformation of FASAs, detailing transformation pathways, key intermediates, transformation kinetics, and  enzymes involved. Finally, we identify critical research gaps and propose future directions to advance the study of the sorption and biotransformation of FASAs in environmental systems. Mechanistic understanding of these processes is crucial for managing sites impacted with FASAs."

This study investigated the compositions, formation pathways, and sources of OSs at a coastal site of the South China Sea in summer. Thirty-three OS species were quantified by using an UHPLC-Orbitrap MS and were assessed under marine and terrestrial air mass origins. iOSs (isoprene-derived OSs) ranked the highest, followed by C2/C3 OSs (OSs with two or three carbon atoms). The formation of iOSs was influenced by aerosol pH and their major precursor (isoprene), with photochemical processes playing a significant role in terrestrial transport. Different from urban conditions, sea breezes favored the formation of 2-MAS (C4H7O7S–) over 2-MTS (C5H11O7S–) even under low NOx levels, mainly attributed to the high temperature and dominance of aqueous oxidation. Compared to terrestrial transport, the formation of C2/C3 OSs was more favored than that of iOSs under the influence of sea breezes. Marine biogenic emission was quantified as an important source of C2/C3 OSs. This study enhances our understanding of the influence of both terrestrial and marine factors on the formation pathways of atmospheric OSs and emphasizes the significant contribution of marine biogenic sources to OSs."

Previous studies have demonstrated associations of temperature with fall risk, but the effect and burden of hourly relative humidity and fall morbidity have been rarely investigated. Fall data and meteorological data were collected from the National Injury Surveillance System during 2006–2021 in China. Associations between hourly relative humidity and fall onset were analyzed using conditional logistic regression combined with a distributed lag nonlinear model. Stratified analysis was used to identify potential association modifiers. Several sensitivity analyses were applied to examine the robustness of the results. The study involved 4 197 495 fall-related cases. Relative humidity exhibited monotonic relationships with the fall onset risk. The excess risk (ER) of falls appeared immediately at lag 0 h and persisted for 8 h. A 10% decrease in relative humidity was associated with a 1.35% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83–1.87%) increase in excess risk of falls and much higher risk for males (ER = 1.89%, 95% CI: 1.29–2.48%) than that for females (ER = 0.52%, 95% CI: 0.14–0.90%). The excess risk of fall injury was the highest among individuals aged 5–14 years (ER = 3.45%, 95% CI: 2.57–4.32%) compared to other age groups. Moreover, compared to the highest relative humidity, the attributable fraction (AF) due to low relative humidity exposure was 4.94% (95% CI: 4.88–4.98%). Subgroup analyses revealed that males, individuals aged 5–14 years, students, cases occurring in public places, and cases engaged in sports activities were more susceptible to relative humidity than their correspondents. Regional disparities were observed, with individuals in southern China or warm regions showing greater sensitivity to changes in relative humidity. Results of this study suggest that hourly low relative humidity exposure is associated with an increased risk of fall onset. These findings underscore the necessity of time-specific interventions to mitigate the relative humidity risk."

As MJOs propagate over the Indian Ocean, some of them can be penetrated by fast‐moving equatorial Kelvin waves originating to the west of the MJOs. Through a series of sensitivity experiments, we demonstrate that these penetrating Kelvin waves can modulate the eastward propagation speed of MJO rainfall. Deep convection in the western MJO rainfall envelope initiates more frequently and produces greater lifetime rainfall when a convectively active Kelvin phase is present, while the opposite occurs during a convectively suppressed Kelvin phase. This alteration in deep convection activity can lead to notable changes in the propagation of the large‐scale MJO rainfall envelope. The modulation of deep convection lifetime rainfall by penetrating Kelvin waves primarily occurs through their impact on deep convection rainfall area, which is closely related to the variations in lower‐tropospheric moisture induced by the Kelvin waves."

 Quantum error correction [1–4] is essential for bridging the gap between the error rates of physical devices and the extremely low error rates required for quantum algorithms. Recent error-correction demonstrations on superconducting processors [5–8] have focused primarily on the surface code [9], which offers a high error threshold but poses limitations for logical operations. The color code [10] enables more efficient logic, but it requires more complex stabilizer measurements and decoding. Measuring these stabilizers in planar architectures like superconducting qubits is challenging, and realizations of color codes [11–19] have not addressed performance scaling with code size on any platform. Here, we present a comprehensive demonstration of the color code on a superconducting processor [8]. Scaling the code distance from three to five suppresses logical errors by a factor of Λ3/5 = 1.56(4). Simulations indicate this performance is below the threshold of the color code, and the color code may become more efficient than the surface code following modest device improvements. We test transversal Clifford gates with logical randomized benchmarking [20] and inject magic states [21], a key resource for universal computation, achieving fidelities exceeding 99 % with post-selection. Finally, we teleport logical states between color codes using lattice surgery [22]. This work establishes the color code as a compelling research direction to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation on superconducting processors in the near future."

 Microglia play a key role in the response to amyloid beta in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In this context, the major transcriptional response of microglia is the upregulation of APOE, the strongest late-onset AD risk gene. Of its three isoforms, APOE2 is thought to be protective, while APOE4 increases AD risk. We hypothesised that the isoforms change gene regulatory patterns that link back to biological function by shaping microglial transcriptomic and chromatin landscapes. We use RNA- and ATAC-sequencing to profile gene expression and chromatin accessibility of human microglia xenotransplantated into the brains of male APPNL-G-F mice. We identify widespread transcriptomic and epigenomic differences which are dependent on APOE genotype and are corroborated across the profiling assays. Our results indicate that impaired microglial proliferation, migration and immune responses may contribute to the increased risk for late-onset AD in APOE4 carriers, while increased phagocytic capabilities and DNA-binding of the vitamin D receptor in APOE2 microglia may contribute to the isoform’s protective role.

 Histopathology is the reference standard for diagnosing the presence and nature of many diseases, including cancer. However, analyzing tissue samples under a microscope and summarizing the findings in a comprehensive pathology report is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and non-standardized. To address this problem, we present HistoGPT, a vision language model that generates pathology reports from a patient’s multiple full-resolution histology images. It is trained on 15,129 whole slide images from 6705 dermatology patients with corresponding pathology reports. The generated reports match the quality of human-written reports for common and homogeneous malignancies, as confirmed by natural language processing metrics and domain expert analysis. We evaluate HistoGPT in an international, multi-center clinical study and show that it can accurately predict tumor subtypes, tumor thickness, and tumor margins in a zero-shot fashion.

Furthermore, authors demonstrate a heterosynaptic role of eCB (endocannabinoid) signaling as the underlying molecular mechanism. 
 Innate escape behaviors, while not requiring prior learning, are shaped by an animal’s learned experiences, such as previous exposure. Here, we found that learned threat experience in mice enhances flight behaviors, which is linked to increased activation of cholecystokinin-expressing neurons in the dorsal premammillary nucleus (PMdCCK neurons), a population that controls circa-strike escape responses. This heightened activity coincides with reduced inhibition from parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons in the ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden (VTgPV), which typically suppress PMdCCK activity and escape behaviors. Furthermore, threat memory prompts a prefrontal projection to stimulate the release of endocannabinoids, inhibiting the axon terminals of VTgPV neurons. The necessity of this endocannabinoid-mediated disinhibition for the observed enhancement in flight behaviors is confirmed through genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade of endocannabinoid receptors on VTgPV neurons. Thus, our study uncovers a neural mechanism by which experience amplifies innate escape behaviors, highlighting the crucial role of endocannabinoids. Neural mechanisms underlying strengthening of escape behaviors are not fully understood.

Here, the authors develop SPIED-DIA, a phosphoproteomics method enhancing detection of key phosphorylation sites. They reveal a synergistic MEK-JNK signaling response in colorectal cancer cells, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy. 
 Targeted kinase inhibitors are a cornerstone of cancer therapy, but their success is often hindered by the complexity of cellular signaling networks that can lead to resistance. Overcoming this challenge necessitates a deep understanding of cellular signaling responses. While standard global phosphoproteomics offers extensive insights, lengthy processing times, the complexity of data interpretation, and frequent omission of crucial phosphorylation sites limit its utility. Here, we combine data-independent acquisition (DIA) with spike-in of synthetic heavy stable isotope-labeled phosphopeptides to facilitate the targeted detection of particularly informative phosphorylation sites. Our spike-in enhanced detection in DIA (SPIED-DIA) approach integrates the improved sensitivity of spike-in-based targeted detection with the discovery potential of global phosphoproteomics into a simple workflow. We employed this method to investigate synergistic signaling responses in colorectal cancer cell lines following MEK inhibition. Our findings highlight that combining MEK inhibition with growth factor stimulation synergistically activates JNK signaling in HCT116 cells. This synergy emphasizes the therapeutic potential of concurrently targeting MEK and JNK pathways, as evidenced by the significantly impaired growth of HCT116 cells when treated with both inhibitors. Our results demonstrate that SPIED-DIA effectively identifies synergistic signaling responses in colorectal cancer cells, presenting a valuable tool for uncovering new therapeutic targets and strategies in cancer treatment.

Here, authors develop a high dielectric constant fiber separator that shows substantial polarization under electric field to facilitate a robust and low-resistance solid-electrolyte interphase. 
 The electrostatic effects of separators under the internal electric field are often overlooked, leading to the unreliability of traditional theoretical models. Here we introduce the dielectric constant as a descriptor and develop a high dielectric constant fiber separator primarily composed of phosphorylated cellulose. Under the internal electric field, the intense electron displacement polarization within the high dielectric constant separator enhances the charge transfer kinetics and optimizes the solvation structure, thus mitigating the formation of amorphous organic oligomers at the solid-electrolyte interphase. Furthermore, the separator induces the formation of LiF, thereby forming a robust and low-resistance solid-electrolyte interphase. The separator exhibits high ionic conductivity (0.76 mS cm−1 at 25 °C) and Li+ transference number (0.68). Consequently, the Li||LiFePO4 pouch cell with the prepared separator achieve high specific energy exceeding 350 Wh kg−1 (relative to the mass of pouch cells) under practical quantities of active materials and electrolyte.

 Targeting abnormal dysregulation of adenosine-to-inosine deamination by ADAR enzymes offers a promising therapeutic strategy in cancer research. However, the development of effective inhibitors is impeded by the incomplete structural information on ADAR1 complexes. In this study, we employ a combination of computational 3D modeling and high-speed atomic force microscopy to elucidate the atomic and molecular dynamics of ADAR1. Two distinct interface regions (IFx and IFy) on the surface of the deaminase domain and oligomerization structural models are identified. Single-molecule-level insights into the structural dynamics of ADAR1 reveal the oligomerization of ADAR1 monomers through the self-assembly of deaminase domains. In the presence of the substrate dsRNA, the N-terminal region, including RNA-binding domains, of ADAR1 dimer exhibits a controlled flexible conformation and promotes a stable dimeric interaction with dsRNA for RNA editing. These findings provide the basis for the development of targeted inhibitors to regulate ADAR1 activity in therapeutic applications.

Here, the authors propose that the phonon modes become frustrated in the charge density wave phase of CsV3Sb5. 
 The formation of a star-of-David charge density wave superstructure, resulting from the coordinated displacements of vanadium ions on a corner-sharing triangular lattice, has garnered significant attention to comprehend the influence of electron–phonon interaction within geometrically intricate lattice of Kagome metals, specifically AV3Sb5 (where A represents K, Rb, or Cs). However, understanding of the underlying mechanism behind charge density wave formation, coupled with symmetry-protected lattice vibrations, remains elusive. Here, from femtosecond time-resolved X-ray scattering experiments, we reveal that the phonon mode, associated with cesium ions’ out-of-plane motion, becomes frustrated in the charge density wave phase. Furthermore, we observed the photoinduced emergence of a metastable charge density wave phase, facilitated by alleviating the frustration. By not only elucidating the longstanding puzzle surrounding the intervention of phonons but introducing the phononic frustration, this research offers insights into the competition between phonons and periodic lattice distortions, a phenomenon widespread in other correlated quantum materials including layered high-temperature superconductors. The underlying mechanism behind charge density wave formation in Kagome metals is still not fully understood.

This study quantifies the flood-induced inflow/outflow selective migration by education, employment and age in the United States, and reveals how media sentiment and income effect aggravate selective migration. 
 Escalating flood risks from climate change cause economic losses and alter migration patterns, although their impacts across socioeconomic groups remain underexplored. Here we investigate flood-induced inter-county migration in the United States between 2006 and 2019, and find that floods increase outflow and inflow migration by 2.7% and 1.9%, respectively. Younger, better-educated and employed residents leave, while older, less-educated and unemployed individuals move into affected counties. Such patterns can be amplified by media sentiment on flood risks. Selective migration lowers housing prices but raises rent, suggesting structural changes in flood-prone housing markets. Flood-induced selective migration also has salient impacts on the local labour markets, with net annual income losses estimated to be US$9.3 million and $1.98 million, conditional on education and age profiles, respectively. Our results shed light on how natural disasters influence selective migration conditional on socioeconomic profiles and how information provision interacts with migration incentives.

Here the authors develop an electro-biosystem that can efficiently convert such surplus acetone into valuable long-chain commodity chemicals. 
 The chemical industry faces the pressing issue of managing excess by-products: for example, the phenol sector produces acetone as a by-product in vast quantities exceeding the market demand for acetone. Integrating electrocatalysis and bioengineering offers versatile access to repurposing these by-products into a wide range of valuable commodities. Nevertheless, the lack of suitable intermediate feedstocks prevents smooth integration of the hybrid electro-biosystem. Here we introduce a tandem electro-biosystem that effectively transforms excess acetone from the phenol industry into valuable long-chain compounds using pure isopropyl alcohol (IPA) as an intermediate feedstock. We developed an intercalated ruthenium electrocatalyst that achieves a maximal Faradaic efficiency of 95.6% for acetone-to-IPA conversion, with an IPA partial current density of −240 mA cm−2. We also showed the complete conversion of acetone to ~100% pure IPA using a bipolar membrane electrode assembly device and intercalated ruthenium. We then metabolically engineered the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which can directly feed on electrogenerated pure IPA as a carbon source, secreting p-coumaric acid, free fatty acids or lycopene. This work underscores advancements in the repurposing of industrial by-products and highlights opportunities to reshape the traditional chemical industry using electricity.

 Investigating crustal stress beneath volcanoes is critical to understanding the dynamics of eruptions. To this end, seismology represents a powerful monitoring tool. The opening of fluid-filled fractures due to the interplay of different stress sources produces elastic anisotropy within the crust, affecting the propagation of seismic waves. Here we use probabilistic imaging for the inversion of P-wave travel times to map elastic anisotropy of the magmatic system beneath Mt. Etna (Italy). These images provide localized information about fracture orientations and stress below this active volcano. Comparing inferred stress with independent observations and geodynamic modeling, we show evidence of a pressurized magma storage in a radial dike network between 6 and 16 km depth under the volcano. The radial network of vertical dikes constitutes a system of oriented pathways for the upward migration of magma from the depths, leading to eruptive activity from the summit craters and lateral vents at Mount Etna.

 Agriculture is a major contributor to nutrient pollution that drives eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems. This study integrates hydrological modeling with farmer behavioral analysis to assess the effectiveness of two agricultural conservation practices—cover crops and reduced nitrogen fertilizer application—in reducing nitrate loss from fields in the Tar-Pamlico River Basin of North Carolina. Survey responses from 279 farmers revealed widespread reluctance to adopt conservation practices, particularly strict fertilizer reductions. A hydrological model showed that applying each practice to 25 percent of agricultural land could substantially reduce nitrate export, with cover crops showing greater effectiveness than reduced fertilizer use. However, an integrated socio-hydrological model, which incorporated behavioral responses from farmers, predicted much smaller reductions in nitrate loss due to limited voluntary adoption. Specifically, nitrate reductions were overestimated by a factor of 8 for cover crops and by a factor of 25 for reduced fertilizer application when behavioral responses were excluded. This result highlights a critical limitation of traditional modeling approaches and underscores the importance of integrating human decision-making into environmental policy analysis. By linking policy incentives with both biophysical and social responses, this study offers a more realistic framework for designing cost-effective and impactful agricultural conservation strategies.
