10.1021/acs.est.4c06892,False,Environmental Science & Technology,这篇论文研究了防晒剂Benzophenone-2 (BP2)对斑马鱼神经发育的毒性作用及其机制。研究发现，BP2暴露会引起斑马鱼神经系统发育缺陷，例如活动减少、脑形态异常、神经细胞增殖受损、轴突缩短和神经细胞凋亡增加。代谢组学分析显示多巴胺及其代谢物减少。基因证据表明，BP2的毒性作用与雌激素信号通路，特别是雌激素受体2a和2b (esr2)有关。转录组学分析显示，esr2的激活抑制了神经发育的关键基因lmx1ba的表达。过表达lmx1ba或抑制esr2可以减轻BP2的神经毒性。该研究主要关注的是BP2这种化学物质对生物体神经发育的影响，与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等，并没有直接关系。,[],Zhipeng Qi;Yue Zhai;Yi Han;Keying Li;Tianchen Wang;Peng Li;Jianan Li;Xiaomai Zhou;Xinying Zhao;Weiyi Song,Genetic Evidence for Estrogenic Effects of Benzophenone-2 on Zebrafish Neurodevelopment and Its Signaling Mechanism,"Estrogens play a crucial role in regulating various biological responses during the early stages of neurodevelopment. Benzophenone-2 (BP2), a widely used organic ultraviolet (UV) filter, has been proven as an estrogenic compound, whereas the estrogenic effects of BP2 on neurodevelopment remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the neurodevelopmental toxicity of BP2 by exposing zebrafish embryos from 2 to 120 h postfertilization (hpf) at environmentally relevant concentrations. We demonstrated that early life exposure to BP2 induced multiple concentration-dependent impairments in the nervous system, including hypoactivity, abnormal brain morphology, impaired neurocyte proliferation, shortened axon, and increased neurocyte apoptosis. Moreover, metabolomic profiling revealed a decrease in dopamine (DA) and its metabolites in BP2-treated larvae. Using E2 treatment and morpholino knockdown assays, we provided strong genetic evidence that the BP2-induced behavioral disorders were associated with estrogen-dependent signaling, especially estrogen receptors 2a and 2b (esr2). Subsequently, transcriptomic profiling indicated that the activation of esr2 further inhibited the expression of LIM homeobox transcription factor 1 β a (lmx1ba), which is vital for normal neurodevelopment. Consistently, the overexpression of lmx1ba and inhibition of esr2 obviously alleviated BP2-caused neurotoxicity, uncovering a seminal role of esr2 and lmx1ba in BP2-induced neurodevelopmental toxicity. Our findings provide the first evidence in fish that BP2 can induce neurodevelopmental deficits and brain dysfunction and offer novel insights into the mechanisms of toxicity of BP2 as well as other emerging benzophenones."

The steady state of these webs, shaped by cooperation and competition among trophic levels, prevents pathogen proliferation and invasion, maintaining soil health. Combined pollutants pose a widespread environmental issue, exerting significant pressure on microfood webs. However, understanding how these webs respond to combined pollutants in soil plastispheres, an emerging niche, remains limited. This study explores trophic interactions among bacteria, fungi, and protists, examining their effects on potential pathogens in three soil types amended with Cu or disinfectant, along with their plastispheres, using a microcosm experiment. Pollutant exposure disrupts trophic-level interactions through bottom-up and top-down regulation in soils and plastispheres, respectively. Microfood web network topology parameters prove more sensitive to pollutant stress than indicators from a single trophic-level community composition. Combined exposure causes greater disruption to the microfood web than exposure to a single pollutant (Cu or didecyl dimethylammonium chloride (DDAC)). Plastisphere reinforces negative impacts of combined pollutant exposure on the microfood web network, escalating potential pathogenic bacteria. Overall, this study deepens our understanding of microfood web responses under pollutant pressure in soil plastispheres and provides valuable insights for health risk assessments of soil combined pollutants."

This study presents a new methodology to enhance the reliability of satellite measurements by deriving experimental covariance matrices from the original observation. We focus on the accelerometer measurements (1A dataset) from the GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) C satellite. Using autocorrelation analysis, we create a block‐diagonal covariance matrix for the 1A dataset. We then apply a low‐pass Gaussian filter that integrates this covariance matrix into the least squares estimation, resulting in a refined 1B dataset that minimizes spikes and spurious accelerations while preserving measurement error. Our variance analysis uncovers disturbances linked to geomagnetic storms and the satellite's transitions through Earth's shadow and terminator, with fluctuations notably peaking during the equinoxes."

Using a random forest machine learning model trained with >42,000 in situ measurements and concurrent, collocated environmental predictors, we reconstructed 19 years of 8‐day, 6‐km NCP $NCP$ maps. During 2015–2021, the integrated NCP $NCP$ between late‐May and early‐September (NCPint ${}_{\mathit{int}}NCP$) over the western AO was 10.95±3.30TgC $10.95\pm 3.30\,\text{Tg}\,\mathrm{C}$ per year, with interannual variations positively tracking open water area. While the relationship between NCPint ${}_{\mathit{int}}NCP$ and open water area was quasi‐linear at high latitudes, strong nonlinearity was detected on the inflow shelf. The nonlinearity highlights that the NCPint ${}_{\mathit{int}}NCP$ increase resulted from area gain could be compounded by sea‐ice loss induced ecosystem adjustments. Additional retrospective analysis for 2003–2014 suggests a potential long‐term increase of export production and efficiency in the western AO with sea ice loss."

Here, we present observational indications demonstrating presently ongoing noise‐tipping of a real‐world system. Noise in a river system is associated with the changing flow rate. In particular, we consider the upper Rhine River delta, where flow and sediment fluxes are partitioned over the two downstream branches (bifurcates) of an important river bifurcation. Field observations show that a sequence of peak flows in the 1990s resulted in sudden sediment deposition in one bifurcate, triggering a persistent and ongoing change in the flow partitioning. This has caused the system to move toward an alternative equilibrium state or attractor. An idealized model confirms that a river bifurcation system under such conditions is prone to tipping, and provides insight on the onset of tipping."

Knowledge of detailed lithospheric structures and their potential linkages with surface features offers crucial insights. Here, we present a high‐resolution 3‐D lithospheric velocity model of the southeastern Tibetan Plateau using full‐waveform ambient noise tomography. Our model reveals two prominent low‐velocity anomalies within the middle and lower crust with new characteristics in spatial distribution: Anomaly 1 lies beneath the plateau, and Anomaly 2 beneath the craton has two branches aligning with the Sichuan‐Youjiang tectonic boundary and the eastern margin of the Emeishan igneous province. Furthermore, these two anomalies appear interconnected at deep crust beneath the northern margin of the Emeishan igneous province. We propose that observed crustal velocity lows indicate partially melted materials transported from the high plateau into the cratonic crust along pre‐existing weak zones, which were reactivated during recent continental deformation."

Slip layer thickness changes dynamically with feedbacks between temperature rise, roughness, damage, and fluid pressurization. Natural faults have complex slip histories, ambiguating which layer thicknesses represent a record of seismic slip. The thickness of proven paleoseismic slip layers in nature are ∼ ${\sim} $1 mm–1 cm. Thicker slip layers do not get hot enough to retain coseismic frictional temperature anomalies and thereby prevent the detection of big earthquakes using current methods. We suggest that delocalization—the spontaneous increase in slipping layer thickness during slip—plays a role in coseismic healing and cause biases in the rock record of earthquakes. Recognizing the importance of feedbacks affecting slipping layer thickness is critical to understanding strength and stress variations during earthquakes and to correctly interpreting earthquake source parameters from exhumed faults."

Although extensive research has been conducted on lake heatwaves, little is known about cold‐water extremes, referred to as lake cold spells. Here, we employ a numerical lake model to investigate global lake cold spell dynamics from 1979 to 2100. From 1979 to 2022, lake cold spells have become shorter‐lasting and weaker. Change rates in the occurrence (i.e., total days) and intensity of lake cold spells are −3.96 days decade−1 and 0.26°C decade−1, respectively. In Europe, the decline in lake cold spells is due to increases in the mean of surface water temperatures, whereas in North America, the reduction is due to decreases in the variance of surface water temperature. In the future, lake cold spells will shorten by 19.3 days and weaken by 1.97°C in the end of the 21st century under the high‐greenhouse‐gas‐emission scenario, underscoring a shift in the surface temperature regime that may have an important influence on lake ecosystems."

This study shows that the fungus Talaromyces flavus significantly enhances the dissolution of olivine and lizardite covered by Si‐rich layers up to 3.6 μm thick by one to two orders of magnitude compared to abiotic conditions. Initially, fungal hyphae create dissolution channels ∼10–65 nm deep, promoting element release from altered layers and underlying pristine minerals while oxidizing structural Fe(II). Over time, hyphae penetrate these altered layers, exposing and etching the underlying minerals. Our data suggest that fungal etching and penetration degrade the altered layers, leading to increased interdiffusion of weathering agents and released cations, thereby continuously driving silicate weathering."

However, research pertaining to the impact of heatwaves on vegetation productivity (VPu) and vegetation transpiration (VTu), along with their underlying drivers, particularly in urban areas, remains limited. This study investigates the response of VPu and VTu to heatwave events across 895 global cities from 1990 to 2022. The analysis reveals a notable upward trend in the average heatwave frequency, intensity, and duration across the global cities. Heatwave events demonstrate a detrimental impact on VPu and VTu, resulting in an average decrease of 28% and 26%, respectively, during heatwave occurrences. The attribution analysis reveals divergent driving factors for the decline in VPu and VTu during heatwaves. The decrease in VPu is primarily influenced by SM, contributing 60% to the downward trend of VPu during heatwaves. Notably, VPu displays a sharp downward trend when SM falls below 0.38 m3/m3. In contrast, the primary driver of VTu decline is VPD, contributing more than 66% to the downward trend of VTu during heatwave events. VTu exhibits a significant downward trend when VPD exceeds 1.35 kPa. The results of this study show the important effects of increasingly frequent heatwaves on vegetation transpiration and productivity, and that can be used as quantitative factor to be evaluated when investigating policy measures for the resilience of urban areas."

However, short instrumental records limit our ability to examine the long‐term stability (or stationarity) of hydroclimate teleconnections. Here, we use two last millennium (LM) paleoclimate data assimilation (DA) products to assess the stationarity of hydroclimate teleconnections over two key regions: the southwestern U.S. and Lower Mississippi River basin. Moving correlations between climate indices and regional hydroclimate expose highly nonstationary regional hydroclimate teleconnections with significant periodic variations on multi‐decadal and multi‐centennial timescales. Although limitations of the DA products prohibit a robust analysis of climate mode intensity, consistent sea surface temperature (SST) patterns between DA products during strong and weak teleconnection periods suggest that changing teleconnection strength is driven by the changing relationships between climate modes over the LM. Although our results are sensitive to proxy availability, the DA techniques provide novel insight into the nonstationarity and long‐term variability of North American hydroclimate teleconnections. This work provides a baseline for teleconnection behavior from DA products, which is potentially valuable for decadal prediction."

M. Anas Ali;Neil F. Tandon,Influence of Horizontal Model Resolution on the Horizontal Scale of Extreme Precipitation Events,"A fundamental characteristic of extreme precipitation events (EPEs) is their horizontal scale. This horizontal scale can influence the intensity of an EPE through its effect on the timescale of an EPE as well as its effect on the strength of convective feedbacks. Thus, to have confidence in future projections of extreme precipitation, the horizontal scales of EPEs in global climate models (GCMs) should be evaluated. Analyzing daily output from 27 models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6), including 13 models participating in the High Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP), we computed the horizontal scales of EPEs and extreme ascent for annual maximum EPEs during 1981–2000. We found that the horizontal scales of both EPEs and the associated ascending motion are resolution‐dependent: for a factor of seven increase in horizontal resolution, the horizontal scale decreases by a factor of approximately two to five, with higher sensitivity in the tropics than in the midlatitudes. Further analysis in the southern hemisphere midlatitudes reveals that this resolution dependence results from precipitation during the simulated EPEs that is almost entirely resolved rather than parameterized. However, the EPEs are not simply grid box storms, and analysis of the horizontal scales of geopotential anomalies suggests that the planetary‐scale dynamics in GCMs is not resolution‐dependent. Thus, the dominance of resolved precipitation during EPEs is more likely due to convection on the model grid or formation of strong, poorly resolved fronts, and additional work is needed to explore these possibilities and find a remedy for this resolution dependence."

Therefore, this study aims to investigate the role of aerosol IN effect in the “21⋅7” Henan extreme precipitation event using two simulations based on an aerosol‐aware configuration of the WRF model. One prescribed spatially uniform ice nucleation particles (INP) concentration (labeled CTL), whereas the other incorporated MERRA2 aerosol concentration fields to represent a more realistic INP spatial distribution (labeled M2), which is marked by a west‐east gradient with higher INP concentration in the west. Results show that M2 simulated heavier precipitation near Zhengzhou closer to the observation regarding both spatial distribution and intensity than the CTL simulation. This improvement is attributed to an INP‐induced feedback akin to the aerosol lifetime effect. Specifically, the M2 simulation had higher INP concentration in the west, causing increased rates of heterogeneous ice nucleation as the convection progressed from west to east. This released additional latent heat, intensifying the convection and subsequently enhancing homogeneous ice nucleation, yielding more but smaller cloud ice particles in M2. These ice particles had reduced sedimentation speeds and lower aggregation rates, suppressing precipitation upstream of Zhengzhou. The intensified convection, carrying more water, propagated eastward, ultimately resulting in extremely heavy precipitation near Zhengzhou. This study underscores the aerosol IN effect on cloud microphysics, convection intensity, and regional rainfall distribution, elucidating the crucial role of aerosol‐meteorology coupling in accurately simulating moderate deep convective cloud precipitation."

This study refines the spatial resolution of the CAMS/LSCE inversion system, achieving a global resolution of 0.7° latitude and 1.4° longitude, or three times as many grid boxes as the current operational setup. In a 2‐year inversion assimilating the midday clear‐sky retrievals of the column‐averaged dry air mole fraction of carbon dioxide (XCO2) from NASA's second Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO‐2), the elevated resolution demonstrates an improvement in the representation of atmospheric CO2, particularly at the synoptic timescale, as validated against independent surface measurements. Vertical profiles of the CO2 concentration differ slightly above 22 km between resolutions compared to AirCore profiles, and highlight differences in the vertical distribution of CO2 between resolutions. However, this disparity is not evident for XCO2, as evaluated against independent reference ground‐based observations. Global and regional estimates of natural fluxes for 2015–2016 are similar between the two resolutions, but with North America exhibiting a higher natural sink at high resolution for 2016. Overall, both inversions seem to yield reasonable estimates of global and regional natural carbon fluxes. The increase in calculation time is less than the increase in the number of operations and in the volume of input data, revealing greater efficiency of the code executed on a graphics processing unit. This allows us to make this higher resolution the new standard for the CAMS/LSCE system."

In this study, the characteristics of extreme precipitation days in the eastern Canadian Arctic and Greenland are examined in historical (1980–1999) and future (2080–2099, SSP5‐8.5) variable‐resolution Community Earth System Model simulations. Comparisons between the simulations illustrate potential changes in the frequency and intensity of these events in the region. Extreme precipitation is expected to increase broadly across the region. The frequency of the most intense daily precipitation rates is projected to rise, particularly in the northernmost areas. The seasonality of extremes does not shift substantially in the future simulation with most areas receiving the highest accumulations and increases during the summer. However, southeastern Greenland is projected to see decreases in extreme precipitation. Algorithms detecting atmospheric rivers and cyclones are employed to assess how their changes may factor into changes in extreme precipitation. Cyclone frequency remains largely consistent with slight decreases near southeastern Greenland, which may explain decreased extreme precipitation seen in the region. Atmospheric rivers are projected to become more frequent across the domain, largely during the summer. Although the majority of the region's extreme precipitation is associated with cyclones, this suggests that atmospheric rivers become more important in a warming climate. These results provide insight into potential changes in impactful precipitation events in the region and how the processes driving them may change."
10.1029/2024JD041090,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文研究了使用高分辨率天气研究预报模型（WRF）模拟中阿根廷地区对流性降水过程中，模拟结果与实际观测结果之间偏差的原因。研究发现，模型高估了对流性降水，低估了层状降水，这种偏差与对流有效位能（CAPE）的大小以及模拟中产生的降水性对流单体数量有关。即使提高模型分辨率，偏差也没有显著改善，表明影响模拟精度的因素可能不仅仅是模型分辨率。研究使用了雷达、卫星和探空仪等多种大气环境遥感技术获取观测数据，对改进天气预报模型和提高降水预报精度具有重要意义。,"['Precipitation', 'Rainfall', 'Convective available potential energy (CAPE)', 'Radar', 'Satellite', 'Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model', 'Cloud', 'Atmospheric instability', 'Model resolution']",Zhixiao Zhang;Adam C.

Zipser,Dependencies of Simulated Convective Cell and System Growth Biases on Atmospheric Instability and Model Resolution,"This study evaluates convective cell properties and their relationships with convective and stratiform rainfall within a season‐long convection‐permitting weather research and forecasting simulation over central Argentina using radar, satellite, and radiosonde measurements from the RELAMPAGO‐CACTI field campaign. The simulation slightly underestimates radar‐estimated rainfall over the ∼3.5‐month evaluation period but underestimates stratiform rainfall by 46% and overestimates convective rainfall by 43%. As convective available potential energy (CAPE) increases, the convective rainfall overestimation decreases, but the stratiform rainfall underestimation increases such that the contribution of convective to total rainfall remains constantly high biased by ∼26%. Overestimated convective rainfall arises from the simulation generating 2.6 times more precipitating convective cells (14,299) than observed by radar (5,662) despite similar observed and simulated cell growth processes, with relatively wide cells contributing mostly to excessive convective rainfall. Relatively shallow cells, typically reaching heights of 4–7 km, contribute most to the cell number bias. This cell number bias increases as CAPE decreases, potentially because cells and their updrafts become narrower and more under‐resolved as CAPE decreases. The gross overproduction of precipitating shallow cells leads to overly efficient precipitation and inadequate detrainment of ice aloft, thereby diminishing the formation of robust stratiform rainfall regions. Decreasing model horizontal grid spacing from 3 to 1 or 0.333 km for low (<300 J kg−1) and high CAPE (>1,000 J kg−1) cases results in minimal change to cell number, depth, and convective‐to‐stratiform partitioning biases. This suggests that improving prediction of these convective properties depends on factors beyond solely increasing model resolution."

Therefore, this study investigated the variability of ET and its components over the alpine grasslands of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and the driving factors underlying these changes during 1961–2013. The results showed that the annual ET over alpine grasslands was 339 mm, of which 59% and 41% were contributed by E and T, respectively. Annual ET, E, and T over the TP grasslands changed insignificantly before 1995, whereas increased dramatically during 1995–2013. Regarding different alpine grassland types, annual ET and its components in seasonal frost regions (SAG) were larger than in permafrost regions (PAG). The increase of ET and its components in PAG was profoundly larger than that in the SAG region during 1995–2013. Water and energy factors controlled the ET of approximately 65% and 31% area of the TP grasslands, respectively. Leaf area index was the major cause of T variability throughout 64% area of TP grasslands, while regions where energy factors were the major force of T change were mainly located in the eastern SAG region. Variability of E on entire TP grasslands (81%) was mainly regulated by available water supply. Our results indicate that as permafrost degradation has the potential to amplify climate warming and precipitation increase, ET over the PAG region was expected to continue increasing faster than the SAG region."

 Multi-target single-molecule super-resolution fluorescence microscopy offers a powerful means of understanding the distributions and interplay between multiple subcellular structures at the nanoscale. However, single-molecule super-resolution imaging of whole mammalian cells is often hampered by high fluorescence background and slow acquisition speeds, especially when imaging multiple targets in 3D. In this work, we have mitigated these issues by developing a steerable, dithered, single-objective tilted light sheet for optical sectioning to reduce fluorescence background and a pipeline for 3D nanoprinting microfluidic systems for reflection of the light sheet into the sample. This easily adaptable microfluidic fabrication pipeline allows for the incorporation of reflective optics into microfluidic channels without disrupting efficient and automated solution exchange. We combine these innovations with point spread function engineering for nanoscale localization of individual molecules in 3D, deep learning for analysis of overlapping emitters, active 3D stabilization for drift correction and long-term imaging, and Exchange-PAINT for sequential multi-target imaging without chromatic offsets.

We perform a metagenomic study of archaeological dental calculus from 102 individuals, originating from 10 Pacific islands and 1 island in Island Southeast Asia spanning ~3000 years. Oral microbiome DNA preservation in calculus is far higher than that of human DNA in archaeological bone, and comparable to that of calculus from temperate regions.

 The initial fine-tuning processes are crucial for successful bone regeneration, as they guide skeletal stem cells through progenitor differentiation toward osteo- or chondrogenic fate. While fate determination processes are well-documented, the mechanisms preceding progenitor commitment remain poorly understood. Here, we identified a transcription factor, Zfp260, as pivotal for stem cell maturation into progenitors and directing osteogenic differentiation. Zfp260 is markedly up-regulated as cells transition from stem to progenitor stages; its dysfunction causes lineage arrest at the progenitor stage, impairing bone repair. Zfp260 is required for maintaining chromatin accessibility and regulates Runx2 expression by forming super-enhancer complexes. Furthermore, the PKCα kinase phosphorylates Zfp260 at residues Y173, S182, and S197, which are essential for its functional activity. Mutations at these residues significantly impair its functionality.

 Neural preconfigured activity patterns (nPAPs), conceptualized as organized activity parcellated into groups of neurons, have been proposed as building blocks for cognitive and sensory processing. However, their existence and function in motor networks have been scarcely studied. Here, we explore the possibility that nPAPs are present in the motor thalamus (VL/VM) and their potential contribution to motor-related activity. To this end, we developed a preparation where VL/VM multiunitary activity could be robustly recorded in mouse behavior evoked by primary motor cortex (M1) optogenetic stimulation and forelimb movements. VL/VM-evoked activity was organized as rigid stereotypical activity patterns at the single and population levels. These activity patterns were unable to dynamically adapt to different temporal architectures of M1 stimulation. Moreover, they were experience-independent, present in virtually all animals, and pairs of neurons with high correlations during M1-stimulation also presented higher correlations during spontaneous activity, confirming their preconfigured nature. Finally, subpopulations expressing specific M1-evoked patterns also displayed specific movement-related patterns. Our data demonstrate that the behaviorally related identity of specific neural subpopulations is tightly linked to nPAPs.

 Anisotropy of artificial light at night (ALAN) has been revealed from satellite observations, as Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite Day/Night Band (VIIRS DNB) provides multi-angle measurements of ALAN. However, the knowledge behind this phenomenon is very limited. In this study, we hypothesize that vegetation phenology impacts the anisotropy of ALAN, which is defined as the change in radiant intensity with viewing zenith angle (VZA). The time series Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) quantifying the vegetation phenology and Change Index (CI) quantifying the ALAN anisotropy were extracted from VNP13A1 and VNP46A2 products, respectively. We analyzed the effect of vegetation phenology by comparing the anisotropy of ALAN at the same location across different seasons in eleven suburban study areas in North America. The anisotropy of ALAN was found to exhibit obvious seasonal dynamic which is consistent with that of NDVI, and these two variables showed significant positive correlation at both pixel scale (0.41 < r < 0.79) and regional scale (0.56 < r < 0.92). Furthermore, we found that the seasonality of the ALAN anisotropy was significantly correlated with the seasonality of vegetation over the eleven study areas (r = 0.75). All these results suggest that vegetation growth can reduce the anisotropy of ALAN. In other words, vegetation growth leads to a more even distribution of emitted light in different directions, which supports our hypothesis. These findings are potentially useful to improve the quality of time series nighttime light data by angular normalization considering vegetation phenology and better build City Emission Function (CEF) for modeling astronomic light pollution."

10.1016/j.atmosenv.2024.120943,False,Atmospheric Environment,这篇论文研究了位于Yeosu国家石化工业园区PM2.5和气态污染物的来源。它使用源解析模型对收集到的PM2.5样本进行了化学成分分析，并确定了主要的污染物来源，例如工业和燃烧过程排放的元素碳（EC）、铅（Pb）、镍（Ni）、铜（Cu）和有机碳（OC），以及一些特定的气态污染物，例如氯仿、异丙苯和二氯苯。研究发现，PM2.5的氧化潜能与主要排放源（特别是EC和Pb）显著相关。该研究主要关注的是地面监测数据分析，并未涉及到大气环境遥感技术，例如卫星观测或大气成分的遥感分析。因此，它与大气环境遥感技术的相关性较弱。,"['PM2.5', 'gaseous pollutants', 'air quality monitoring', 'source apportionment', 'chemical composition']",Seoyeong Choe;Geun-Hye Yu;Myoungki Song;Sea-Ho Oh;Hajeong Jeon;Dong-Hoon Ko;Chaehyeong Park;Min-Suk Bae,Identification of major sources of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and gaseous pollutants contributing to oxidative potential in the Yeosu national petrochemical industrial complex: Insights from the PMF model,"•EC, Pb, Ni, Cu, and OC mainly contribute to PM2.5from industry and combustion. •Major gases include chloroform, isopropylbenzene, and dichlorobenzene. •Oxidative potential shows strong correlation with primary emissions. 
 This investigation seeks to characterize and pinpoint the sources of PM2.5 and various gaseous pollutants within the Yeosu National Industrial Complex by employing the source apportionment model. PM2.5 samples were gathered at 3-h intervals during various seasons using both quartz and Teflon filters, and subjected to chemical composition analysis. The mean PM2.5 concentration was recorded at 22.8 μg/m³, with elevated levels observed during the winter. The source analysis delineated 5 p.m.2.5 sources, featuring combinations of EC, Pb, Ni, Cu, and OC. Gaseous pollutants were categorized into CO, CO2, Chloroform, Isopropylbenzene & Chlorobenzene, Dichlorobenzene, and Vehicle emissions. Conditional Probability Functions analysis revealed various source inflow directions, predominantly influenced by the nearby industrial complex. The dithiothreitol assay-oxidative potential normalized to 9,10-phenanthrenequinone (QDTT-OP) of PM2.5 demonstrated significant correlations with primary emission sources, particularly EC and Pb, due to incomplete combustion processes. Effectively managing these emissions is essential for mitigating health risks related to air pollution. This research offers crucial information for the formulation of strategies aimed at enhancing air quality and public health in industrialized regions."
10.1016/j.atmosenv.2024.120906,False,Atmospheric Environment,这篇论文主要研究的是多溴联苯醚 (PBDEs) 在杭州办公室环境中的污染状况、相分配、潜在来源以及健康风险。研究人员采集了办公室空气、颗粒物和灰尘样本，检测了PBDEs的同系物浓度，并分析了其粒径分布、气尘平衡以及潜在来源。研究发现，BDE-209是主要的同系物，颗粒物中的PBDEs浓度高于气相，并且塑料文件夹、生态板、鼠标垫和电缆护套可能是潜在的污染源。最后，研究评估了PBDEs的健康风险，结果表明风险在可接受范围内。该研究属于室内环境污染研究，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大，例如，没有涉及到空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析等遥感技术。,"['polybrominated diphenyl ethers', 'indoor air quality', 'health risk assessment', 'gas phase', 'particle phase', 'dust']",Mantong Jin;Jingjing Guo;Ziyu Xu;Liwei Sun;Shunfei Zhang,"Pollution status, phase partitioning, potential sources, and health impacts of polybrominated diphenyl ethers in Hangzhou offices","•BDE-209 was the main congener in all phases. •The particle size distribution of PBDEs was bimodal. •PBDEs in gas was transferred into dust. •The predicted concentration of PBDEs was smaller than measured concentration. •The health risk of PBDEs in Hangzhou offices was acceptable. 
 Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have persistence and toxicities, so exposure to PBDEs is associated with various health hazards. Thus, it is crucial to study the pollution status of PBDEs in office microenvironments, which are the primary active places for people working in offices. We collected 80 samples (air, particulate matter, and dust) from 10 offices in Hangzhou and detected the congeners of PBDEs using GC-ECD. Median concentrations of total PBDEs in particle phase, gas phase, and dust were 108.28 pg/m3, 35.63 pg/m3 and 59.22 ng/g, respectively. BDE-209 was the primary congener in various media. The particle size distribution was bimodal and was primarily distributed in the ＜1.1 and > 7 μm particle size segment. We predicted the concentration of PBDEs in different phases to better explore the fate of released PBDEs. The measured value of the equilibrium coefficient between gas and dust indicated that PDBEs in the gas-phase were transferred into the dust. The predicted Cg−pre value of PBDEs was smaller than the measured value Cg, especially BDE-209. The measured concentration of low-brominated PBDEs in particles was higher than the predicted concentration, which may be because the non-equilibrium model did not consider the dry and wet deposition of particles. The PBDE concentrations in the materials were in the following order: mouse pad < cable shell < plastic folder < eco-board. The analysis of indoor sources of PBDEs demonstrated that plastic folders, eco-boards, and mouse pads and cable shells may be potential sources of PBDEs in the air, dust, and particles, respectively. The HQ of PBDEs in Hangzhou offices was far less than 1, indicating that the health risk was within the acceptable range."

 This study examined the sensitivity of cloud microphysics and planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterization in the simulation of localized heavy rainfall in northern Japan such as the August 2022 event. Accurate simulation/forecast of such quasi-stationary line-shaped mesoscale convective systems is a pressing issue for the region. The sensitivities of 17 different cloud microphysics parameterization schemes, including single and double moments, and eight different PBL schemes, including nonlocal and local closure schemes, were investigated. Overall, the simulated heavy rainfall in August 2022 was notably sensitive to the microphysics and PBL schemes. Among the microphysical parameterization comparisons, the Goddard and Eta (Ferrier) schemes exhibited superior performance in simulating the magnitude and spatial distribution of heavy rainfall events, evaluated using various precipitation statistics and object-based measure (Structure-Amplitude-Location (SAL) method). Considering the sensitivity of the PBL schemes, the combination of the Goddard microphysics scheme and the Grenier–Bretherton–McCaa PBL scheme performed the best in the 48-h basin-average precipitation depth and spatial distribution RMSE. Ensemble correlation analysis revealed that a better representation of the strong water vapor flux convergence was the key to simulating localized heavy rainfall. The optimal combination of physical schemes reasonably simulated the July 2020 and July 2023 heavy rainfall events in the Tohoku region, suggesting their potential for future RCM studies in the region."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2024.107806,True,Atmospheric Research,这篇研究论文探讨了北大西洋和海洋大陆海表温度异常对中国东北玉米产量的影响。文章指出，春末夏初的严重干旱对玉米生长造成严重损害，而北大西洋和海洋大陆的SST异常是导致中国东北夏季干旱的重要前兆因素。北大西洋的SST异常可以通过激发罗斯比波影响中国东北，而海洋大陆的SST异常则可以通过东亚-太平洋遥相关影响东亚急流，最终导致中国东北土壤水分减少。研究人员利用北大西洋和海洋大陆的春季SST异常作为预测指标，成功建立了中国东北玉米产量的预测模型，该模型具有较高的预测精度。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它利用了卫星遥感观测到的SST数据来分析气候变化对农业生产的影响，这属于利用遥感技术进行气候监测和农业预测的应用。,"['Sea surface temperature (SST)', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'Climate change', 'Drought monitoring', 'Maize yield prediction', 'Atmospheric circulation', 'Teleconnection']",Sichao Yan;Huopo Chen,The significant influence of the sea surface temperature anomalies over North Atlantic and the Maritime Continent on maize yield in Northeast China,"•The severe drought from the jointing to the maturity period has severely affected the maize growth. •The SST anomalies over the North Atlantic and the Maritime Continent are two precursor factors to summer drought over NEC. •The maize yield series predicted by the prediction model has high covariance with the observed values. 
 Northeastern China (NEC) is the largest grain base in China. Improving understanding of the effect of climate change on grain production over NEC is conducive to providing immediate response strategies for grain production. In this study, the relationships of the maize production with the dry state during the different maize growth stage have been investigated using the year-to-year increment method. Results showed that the severe drought that occurred from the jointing to maturity period have exerted severe effects on the maize growth. Further analysis indicated that the sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over North Atlantic and Maritime Continent in later spring are the important factors affecting the summer droughts over NEC. The late spring SST anomaly over North Atlantic can excite the Rossby waves from the western North Atlantic and propagate eastward to NEC. The snow anomaly over western Siberia in late spring and the soil moisture anomaly over NEC in summer are key factors linking the SST anomaly to drought over the NEC. On the other hand, the Maritime Continent SST anomaly in late spring can modulate the activity of the East Asian jet stream via the East Asia-Pacific (EAP) teleconnection, which can provide the favorable conditions for the soil moisture reduction over NEC. Eventually, a predictive model for maize yield over NEC is successfully developed by using the predictive indices of the North Atlantic and the Maritime Continental SST during late spring. Both the cross-validation and independent sample tests show that the calibrated prediction model is robust and exhibits high skill in predicting maize yield over NEC."
