10.1088/1748-9326/adc74e,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文关注的是气候预测的降尺度问题，即如何将全球气候模型的预测结果转化为地方尺度的气象数据，以便更好地进行基础设施规划等。论文强调了不同降尺度方法导致预测结果差异很大，即使使用相同的气候模型输入数据。因此，论文呼吁对降尺度方法进行更严格的基准测试，以帮助用户选择合适的降尺度数据集。虽然气候变化与大气环境相关，但该论文主要关注气候模型的降尺度技术和预测结果的比较，而不是大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强。,"['climate projections', 'downscaling', 'precipitation', 'climate models', 'benchmarking']",Samantha H Hartke;Andrew J Newman;Ethan D Gutmann;Rachel R McCrary;Nicholas D Lybarger;Flavio Lehner;Andrew W Wood;Jeffrey R Arnold;Keith W Dixon,Lack of clear standards and usable comparisons of downscaled climate projections pose a roadblock for US climate discovery and adaptation,"The release of global climate projections coupled with the demand for local-resolution climate-forced meteorology has prompted many research groups to downscale these projections using various statistical, dynamical, and current machine learning techniques. Such downscaled datasets are being used to plan infrastructure and other community needs over the coming decades. Faced with roughly a dozen available US downscaled datasets, many practitioners ask, ‘What are the relevant differences between datasets?’ This work highlights the difficulty of comparing downscaled datasets and illustrates ways in which datasets differ even when using identical climate model input data. We show that substantial variability in precipitation projections arises from downscaling alone and that the downscaled dataset agreement varies depending on global climate projection. This analysis emphasizes the need for greater coordination and movement toward rigorous benchmarking of downscaling strategies within the downscaling research community, à la the land-modeling community, to better quantify downscaling dataset differences, strengths, and weaknesses for practitioners."
10.1088/1748-9326/adcad3,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注气候变化应对措施的评估框架，特别是关于二氧化碳移除（CDR）的措施。它通过系统性文献回顾，分析了现有评估框架的关键需求，并识别了框架中存在的不足，例如缺乏一致性和透明度，以及对时间动态和政策相关方面的考虑不足。该研究建议未来的研究应加强对短期和长期时间动态的考虑，并纳入伦理和社会科学的视角，以支持更明智的决策。虽然该研究与大气环境有关，但其重点在于政策和评估框架，而不是直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['carbon dioxide removal', 'climate change responses', 'assessment frameworks', 'policy', 'ethics', 'social science']",F Gulde;M Witting;F Neuber;C Baatz;M Garschagen,Frameworks to assess climate change responses—a systematic analysis to enhance frameworks for carbon dioxide removal,"Achieving ambitious climate targets, such as greenhouse gas neutrality, requires a broad mix of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) measures across different scales and timeframes. The planning and implementation of these measures necessitate holistic assessment frameworks that transparently and consistently evaluate what is feasible and desirable in both the short and long term. While the development and refinement of such frameworks is increasingly discussed in the context of CDR, a systematic analysis of existing frameworks in light of prevailing requirements is still missing. This study addresses this gap by conducting a systematic literature review of assessment frameworks used for climate change responses, analyzing how they address what we identified as key requirements. By expanding the scope beyond CDR specific assessment frameworks, we identify and derive valuable insights and approaches that can inform their refinement. Following a three-step approach, we first conducted a preceding scoping review to determine key requirements for holistic assessments. Second, a systematic literature review was conducted to identify a broad range of assessment frameworks for climate responses. Third, based on a qualitative content analysis, we examined how these frameworks address the previously identified key requirements. The results reveal that existing assessment frameworks often lack a consistent and transparent conceptual and operational structure. This can lead to misinterpretations and misunderstandings. Policy-relevant aspects such as the integration of temporal dynamics and portfolio assessments, including the investigation of synergies and trade-offs, are rarely addressed, although promising approaches are emerging. Following the current discussion to adjust assessment frameworks for CDR, future research should incorporate both short- and long-term temporal dynamics and strengthen the inclusion of ethical and social science perspectives. By synthesizing existing approaches and identifying critical gaps, this review provides guidance towards more robust and transparent assessment frameworks, supporting well-informed decision-making in the context of CDR."

Currently, its deployment is largely driven by voluntary actions from private organizations rather than by policy mandates. In this formative phase of the CDR sector, the important role these organizations play is acknowledged, yet there are scarce empirical insights into their perspectives. This study explores the role of private companies in shaping the early CDR innovation ecosystem by conducting 79 interviews with senior practitioners (suppliers, purchasers/marketplaces, investors) actively involved in CDR markets. Examining their motivations, I find themes that range from personal upbringing and caring for the following generations to being catalytic in the creation of a new industry. All motivations are grounded in the recognition of CDR as an important component of global climate change mitigation. Identified challenges stretch across the categories of technology, organizations, policy and regulation, ecosystem, finances, and the public eye. This presents a complex picture, as all actors seek to solve a multi-faceted, concurrent coordination and scaling problem while dealing with a challenging set of uncertainties. For suppliers, the main challenge is to coordinate with other actors while proving their technology and not losing track of their long-term strategies. Investors and purchasers currently struggle to formulate a case that is suitable for their organizations in the absence of regulation. The analysis underscores the underexplored yet significant role of private organizations in CDR governance and market development, thus addressing a gap in the existing literature. In conclusion, I offer directions for measures that support a timely, efficient, and responsible scale-up of CDR."

A review of futures-thinking applied in the quest for navigating sustainability transformations,"There is a growing call for transformations to remain within safe and just Earth system boundaries. Coherent visions of desired futures can help motivate and orient such transformations towards Sustainability, but the nature of these transformed futures is not well understood. This gap has inspired a growing body of research on ‘preferable’ or ‘desirable’ futures, which can help to unpack what endpoints such transformations to sustainability could entail and what is needed to get there. In this paper, we adopt a mixed methods approach to review the research literature focused on transformative futures so as to gain a general overview of the field and then undertake two qualitative analyses: (i) unpacking the methods, terms and types of outputs produced; and (ii) capturing emergent themes, commonalities and divergences in what is deemed to be a sustainable transformation in the future based on normative visions from either North, South or Global perspectives. Our findings show that the literature landscape on explorative scenarios has significantly increased in the past ten years with most publications led by authors in the Global North. From the fraction of studies that describe desirable futures, visions highlight social, environmental and equity dimensions, but nuances were found between North and South. The visions that suggest the most transformative potential seek a more harmonious human-nature relationship and consider outcomes holistically, but only a fraction offer actual ‘alternatives’ to the status quo. We find that several gaps remain at the interface of biodiversity/ecosystems and justice, or the integration and impact of diverse knowledges and cultures. Addressing these in participatory, just and creative ways seems of utmost urgency. We hope this review can offer a glimpse of how futures-thinking can contribute to research and action on sustainability transformations, and the insights can inform and inspire future research."

The concept relies on artificially generated sea spray aerosols (SSA) at the ocean surface and their transport in sufficient quantities to low-level maritime clouds. A portion of the SSA that reaches cloud height can act as additional cloud condensation nuclei and modify cloud microphysical properties, potentially reducing the amount of solar radiation reaching the sea surface. Although modelling data supports the MCB concept, field experiments demonstrating the dispersion of artificially produced SSA to clouds have not been previously reported. Here, we show that within a field of low-level trade wind cumulus-type clouds, an aerosol plume generated at the sea surface on board a research vessel was rapidly advected to cloud base height. Aircraft measurements conducted during two different sampling strategies, detected the aerosol plume from the vessel’s sea water atomisation system just below cloud bases at 700–900 m altitudes. For an estimated surface level aerosol production rate of 4 × 1014 s−1, aerosol concentrations at cloud base were detected with peak number concentrations of up to ∼1 × 103 cm−3. Although such production rates of aerosol particles are orders of magnitude less than what is envisioned for any practical implementation of MCB, our results indicate that cloud perturbation experiments should now be possible using surface-produced SSA."
10.1088/1748-9326/adccd9,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要关注碳移除（CDR）技术对土地面积的需求，特别是不同CDR技术组合（包括生物质能源、碳捕获与封存等）在实现1.5°C和1.0°C气候目标下的影响。论文将CDR模型与能源系统模型相结合，评估了能源、工业和CDR系统整体的土地需求，并比较了不同CDR路径（生物源、生物技术和技术路径）的优劣。虽然该研究与气候变化相关，但它侧重于土地利用和能源系统建模，而不是大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['carbon dioxide removal', 'CDR technology portfolio', 'energy system model', 'area demand', 'climate change mitigation', 'biomass', 'land use']",Dominik Keiner;Andreas Mühlbauer;Christoph Gerhards;Christian Breyer,Area demand quantification for energy system-integrated negative emissions based on carbon dioxide removal portfolios,"Climate change mitigation will most likely rely on large-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Often, only a few technology options are used, principally bioenergy, carbon capture and sequestration, as well as afforestation and reforestation. If climate change mitigation is based on energy crops, the impact of CDR on area demand may be significant. The CDR-specific area demand is usually not presented. This study compares a CDR technology portfolio prioritising biomass-based solutions to portfolios prioritising low cost, low energy demand, high security, low area demand, and high technology readiness in terms of area demand. The CDR portfolio model is linked with an energy system model to include the area required for solar photovoltaics and wind power for the energy supply of the whole energy–industry–CDR system. A quantitative and qualitative comparison is made using the definitions of gross and net area demand, and the differentiation of CDR routes into biogenic, bio-technical, and technical options. Gross and net area demand differentiate the total area, including spacing or gathering areas (gross) and built-up areas (or areas unsuitable for biodiversity) (net). We consider total CDR demands of 500 GtCO2 for a 1.5°C climate target and 1750 GtCO2 for a 1.0°C climate target by 2100. The results indicate the advantage of technical CDR options regarding area demand compared to biomass-based CDR from energy crops. Including the energy supply for the whole energy–industry–CDR system does not lead to significant area demand. The net area demand can be kept at ca. 1.0% (1.5°C) and below 1.4% (1.0°C) of the total land area, except for the biomass-prioritising portfolio, which has a 3% net land area demand for both climate targets. Biogenic and biotechnical CDR options are estimated to require up to 9.7% of today’s global cropland by the end of the century (net area). The additional net area demand for the 1.0°C target versus the 1.5°C target is comparably small."

We evaluated the associations between neighborhood- and household-level SES metrics and exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM2.5) in two populous Indian cities, ‒Delhi and Chennai. We used data from the Center for cArdiometabolic Risk Reduction in SouthAsia cohort study to obtain household-level SES indicators such as household income, years of education, and wealth index score. Neighborhood-level SES was calculated based on ward-level socio-demographic variables from the 2011 Census of India. Daily average PM2.5 for the years 2010–2016 at a spatial resolution of 1 km × 1 km, were obtained from a hybrid exposure model for each city. For both cities, we observed a stronger association between neighborhood-level SES and ambient PM2.5, than household level SES. The study signifies that neighborhood-level SES factors are important confounders that should be considered while examining the relationship between ambient PM2.5 exposure and health outcomes in the study area."

This study introduces a new machine-learning-based algorithm developed for the Meteosat Second Generation geostationary satellites that can provide a coherent and detailed view of FLS development over large areas over the 24 h day cycle. 
 This study presents an algorithm for the detection of fog and low stratus (FLS) over Europe based on the infrared bands of the SEVIRI (Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager) instrument on board the Meteosat Second Generation geostationary satellites. As the method operates based on the SEVIRI infrared observations only, it is expected to be stationary in time and thus can provide a coherent and detailed view of FLS development over large areas over the 24 h day cycle. The algorithm is based on a gradient boosted tree machine learning model that is trained with ground truth observations from METeorological Aerodrome Report (METAR) stations and the SEVIRI observations at bands centered at 8.7, 10.8, 12.0, and 13.4 µm wavelengths. The METAR data used here comprise a total number of 2 544 400 data points spread over the winters (i.e., 1 September to 31 May) of the years 2016–2022 and 356 locations across Europe. Among them, the data points corresponding to 276 stations and the winters of 2016–2018 and 2019–2021 (∼ 45 % of all data points) were used to train the algorithm. The remaining data points comprise four independent datasets which were used to validate the algorithm's performance and applicability to time spans and locations within the study area (i.e., Europe) that extend beyond those covered by the data points used for the algorithm training, as well as to compare the algorithm's accuracy at the locations of METAR stations with that of the existing state-of-the-art daytime FLS detection algorithm Satellite-based Operational Fog Observation Scheme (SOFOS). Validation of the algorithm against the METAR data showed that the algorithm is well suited for the detection of FLS. Specifically, the algorithm is found to detect FLS with probability of detection (POD) values ranging from 0.70 to 0.82 (for different inter-comparison approaches) and false alarm ratios (FARs) between 0.21 and 0.31. These numbers are very close to those achieved by SOFOS for differentiating FLS from other sky conditions at the tested locations and time spans. These results also showed that the technique's applicability in the study region extends beyond the particular locations and time spans covered by the data points used for training the algorithm."

 Reservoir sedimentation poses a significant challenge to freshwater management, leading to declining storage capacity and inefficient reservoir operations for various purposes. However, trustworthy and independently verifiable information on declining storage capacity or sedimentation rates around the world is sparse and suffers from inconsistent metadata and curation to allow global-scale archiving and analyses. The Global Reservoir Inventory of Lost Storage by Sedimentation (GRILSS) dataset addresses this challenge by providing organized, well-curated, and open-source data on sedimentation rates and capacity loss for 1013 reservoirs in 75 major river basins across 54 countries. This publicly accessible dataset captures the complexities of reservoir sedimentation, influenced by regional factors such as climate, topography, and land use. By curating the information from numerous sources with disparate formats in a homogenized data structure, GRILSS serves as an invaluable resource for water managers, policymakers, and researchers for improved sediment management strategies. The open-source nature of GRILLS promotes collaboration and contributions from the global community to grow the dataset. By providing essential reference data on sedimentation to understand the global challenge of reservoir sedimentation, the GRILLS dataset represents a gateway for the global community to share sedimentation and storage loss data for sustainable operation of world's reservoirs for future generations.

 We present an overview of station NPW, installed in Naypyitaw, Myanmar. The station is equipped with both strong-motion and broadband sensors and is situated 2.6 km from the Sagaing Fault, providing an exceptional near-fault recording of the Mw 7.7 earthquake that occurred on March 28, 2025. The installation and ongoing maintenance of NPW are the result of a collaborative effort between the Department of Meteorology and Hydrology in Naypyitaw and the GFZ Helmholtz Center for Geosciences (GFZ) prompted by the GFZ International Training Course on seismology and seismic hazard assessment (ITC) in 2016. In this study, we provide background information about the collaborative effort that led to the installation of the only local station that provides on-scale measurements of the 2025, Myanmar earthquake. Given the widespread interest for data recorded by station, we describe the instrumental settings in detail, and how to access data and metadata for station NPW, which is part of the GEOFON (GE) network. Given the relevance of the near-fault recordings at NPW not only for constraining the rupture process of the mainshock but also for engineering seismology applications, we analyze key features of the mainshock from an engineering seismology perspective. This includes an examination of ground motion amplitudes, frequency content, and response spectra, and near-fault effects such as fling effect and pulse-like motion. The high-quality near field data at NPW provide valuable information for seismic hazard assessment in the region and offer useful constraints for studies investigating the rupture characteristics of the mainshock, which preliminary findings suggest to have propagated at supershear speed."

Our dataset provides valuable insights into how ecosystems respond to climate extremes worldwide. 
 Land surface energy, water and carbon fluxes are key for understanding Earth’s climate system, yet global continuous high resolution fluxes datasets remain scarce. In this study, we present a global long-term (2000–2020) hourly dataset of terrestrial water-energy-carbon fluxes, generated by integrating model simulations, in-situ measurements, and machine learning with remote sensing and meteorological data. First the integrated STEMMUS-SCOPE model was deployed to simulate land surface fluxes over 170 sites with in-situ measurements. The modeled variables include net radiation (Rn), latent heat flux (LE), sensible heat flux (H), soil heat flux (G), gross primary productivity (GPP), solar-induced fluorescence in 685 nm and 740 nm (SIF685, SIF740). Next optimal interpolation was applied to merge Rn, LE, and H from STEMMUS-SCOPE simulations with eddy covariance observations. The optimal interpolated Rn, LE, H alongside STEMMUS-SCOPE simulated G, GPP, SIF685, SIF740 were then used as training data-pairs to develop the emulator using a multivariate Random Forest (RF) regression algorithm, referred to as Random Forest with Optimal Interpolation (RF_OI) to predict fluxes with global gridded remote sensing and meteorological data. The results demonstrate that RF_OI can estimate land surface fluxes with Pearson Correlation Coefficient score (r-score) values higher than 0.88 except for GPP (Rn 0.99, LE 0.88, H 0.92, G 0.92, GPP 0.8, SIF685 0.99, SIF740 0.99). The testing results on independent stations (which were not included for developing emulators) show r-score values higher than 0.8. The feature importance indicates that incoming shortwave radiation, surface soil moisture, and leaf area index are top predictor variables that determine the prediction performance. This terrestrial flux dataset provides a valuable resource for understanding ecosystem responses to climate extremes on global scale."

In this study, we present a comprehensive strategy for assessing mitochondrial toxicity, exemplified through a case study on medium-chain chlorinated paraffins (MCCPs, CxH2x+2–yCly with 14–17 carbon atoms), one of the most abundant organic pollutants in the human body. Our results demonstrate that MCCP exposure at levels commonly found in humans significantly reduces cellular ATP content by impairing mitochondrial respiration rather than glycolysis. Using an optimized mitochondrial metabolomics approach combined with dose-resolved proteomics, we elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying MCCP-induced mitochondrial defects, including inhibition of the electron transport chain, mitochondrial membrane damage, accumulation of reactive oxygen species, and disruptions in nucleotide metabolism. Notably, over 80% of the MCCP-regulated mitochondrial proteins exhibited EC50 values below the human internal levels of MCCPs, highlighting a significant threat to human health.

While prior research has emphasized the toxicology of engineered NMs, their broader geochemical roles remain underexplored. Catalytically active NMs can influence key environmental processes, such as nutrient cycling and pollutant degradation, through photocatalytic, hydrolytic, and hydrogenation mechanisms. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) (including hydroxyl radicals, singlet oxygen, and hydrogen peroxide) produced via UVA or visible light photocatalysis on NM surfaces drive important transformations. Steady-state ROS concentrations (0.1–10 fM) are comparable to those from excited-state dissolved organic matter (DOM*). NMs can hydrolyze and facilitate the conversion of organic phosphorus to bioavailable inorganic forms or organic carbon to low-molecular-weight compounds, potentially fueling microbial food webs. However, major gaps remain regarding NM diversity, reactivity, and persistence. Addressing these requires integrating advanced nanoanalytical tools (e.g., ICP-MS, electron microscopy with EELS) and functional reactivity assays applied to environmentally sourced NMs over ecologically relevant time scales of days to months. This Perspective highlights NMs as dynamic, transient components of aquatic systems introduced through deposition, runoff, and biogenic activity, with implications for global biogeochemical cycling."

Tsybekmitova;Jianhua Guo;Yayi Wang,A Novel Perspective on the Instability of Mainstream Partial Nitrification: The Niche Differentiation of Nitrifying Guilds,"Short-cut biological nitrogen removal (sBNR) favors the paradigm shift toward energy-positive and carbon-neutral wastewater treatment processes. Partial nitrification (PN) is a key approach to provide nitrite for anammox or denitritation during sBNR, and its stability is the precondition for achieving robust nitrogen removal performance. However, maintaining a stable mainstream PN process has been a long-standing challenge. This review analyzes the mainstream PN process from a microbial ecology perspective, focusing on the niche differentiation among nitrifiers. First, we propose that mainstream PN systems are ecologically unstable, and the failure of the mainstream PN process due to the reactivation of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) can be regarded as a behavior to restore system stabilization. Thus, maintaining mainstream PN systems primarily relies on enhancing the niche differentiation between ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and NOB. We then summarize the realized niches of indigenous nitrifiers within nitrification systems and discuss their ecophysiological characteristics (e.g., cell structure and substrate affinity) that define their specific ecological niches. By comparing the niche breadths of AOB and NOB on various niche axes, we further discuss their niche differentiation and identify the different responses of AOB (resistance) and NOB (resilience) to exogenous perturbations. Finally, we propose outlook for achieving a stable mainstream PN process through an ecological lens. This review provides ecological insights into the instability of the mainstream PN process, which is intended to guide the derivation of optimized strategies from a single-factor approach to integrated solutions."

This study presents a detailed investigation of a passivation effect unique to low-water conditions during the carbonation of forsterite (Mg2SiO4) and highlights the importance of hygroscopicity in influencing metal silicate carbonation. Integrated in situ and ex situ experimental results showed that the decrease in the carbonation rate of forsterite observed after ∼10 h in humid supercritical CO2 (50 °C, 90 bar) correlates with a reduction in water film thickness, and in particular, weakly hydrogen bonded adsorbed water that facilitates ion transport. We attribute the decrease in thickness to a drop in the concentrations of hygroscopic Mg2+, MgHCO3+, and HCO3– ions within the film as the predominate forsterite carbonation product evolves from amorphous magnesium carbonate (AMC) to magnesite (MgCO3). When more soluble AMC is present, hygroscopic ion concentrations are higher, drawing more water from the supercritical phase to the forsterite surface. Carbonation rates are faster because thicker water films can better mobilize ions to growing carbonates. In contrast, when less soluble magnesite predominates, hygroscopic ion concentrations are lower, water films are thinner, and carbonate rates are slower."

Herein, we performed a comparative analysis of medical face masks (MFMs) with calcium carbonate (CaCO3) additives against those devoid of CaCO3 to understand their roles in microplastic release. Briefly, our investigation employed surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to examine micro- and nanoplastic release, while the stereoscopic characterization of mixing states of additives in microplastic was accomplished through a simulated Raman scattering (SRS). We also pioneered a three-dimensional imaging (3D imaging) method for investigating the internal aging of plastic using SRS, which clearly revealed the link between inorganic additives inside polymers and photoaging. We found that inorganic additives substantially accelerate the photoaging of the plastic materials through multiple pathways and induce more small-sized microplastics. Follow-up radical quenching experiments confirmed carbonate radicals as the main cause of this phenomenon. Our research exposes the hazardous potential of inorganic additives in masks to amplify the emission of microplastics."

This study investigates the uptake of 61 PM chemicals by and distribution in rocket (Eruca sativa) in pot experiments from spiked water and treated municipal wastewater. The relative uptake (RU; share of theoretical maximum uptake) into rocket exceeded 10% for 18 PM chemicals, among others, perfluoropropionic acid (72% RU), trifluoroacetic acid (67%), and tetrafluoroborate (40%). The median plant uptake (p ≤ 0.05) and translocation factor (p < 0.0001) were significantly higher for PM chemicals than reported for less polar chemicals into leafy greens from literature. Irrigation of rocket with reclaimed municipal wastewater resulted in the accumulation of 23 analytes. However, a toxicological threshold of concern approach showed that no critical exposure is reached for these compounds at normal consumption levels. Comparing wastewater treatment plant effluent concentrations with plant uptake data led to a prioritization of PM chemicals, which might be especially relevant for agricultural wastewater reuse and should be considered in risk assessment."

We sampled in September 2023 in eastern San Luis Obispo County, California, in an area with confirmed Coccidioides immitis in soils. We completed 41 20 min flights across 14 sites using UAS equipped with an 8 L/min bioaerosol sampler and a low-cost particulate matter sensor. We sampled source soils and air under ambient conditions using one UAS at 1–10 m above ground level, and under a simulated high-dust event using two UAS, one at <2 m height and one at 5–12 m.

In this study, we systematically examine the key factors─supporting electrolyte composition, charging voltage, and discharging voltage─that impact boron removal performance in both setups, with the insights provided aiding both process optimization and full-scale application. Our results indicate that, while the BPM-assisted system operates at a relatively lower cell voltage and consumes approximately 67% the amount of the energy used by the AEM-assisted system, the requirement for additional salt for sufficient conductivity and water dissociation is impractical for removal of boron from the RO permeate. Furthermore, due to the high cost of BPMs, the overall operational cost of the BPM-assisted system is ∼5-fold higher than that of the AEM-assisted system. Our results further show that applying a reverse potential (−1 V) during discharge desorbs only ∼60–65% of the boron, suggesting that electrode/membrane replacement is needed to maintain activity. Overall, while membrane-assisted electrosorption shows promise for boron removal from RO permeate, significant advancements are needed for both configurations to improve boron removal rates, reduce electrode and membrane costs, and decrease energy demands."

However, UV-C radiation from these devices can produce indoor air pollutants including ozone, oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs), and ultrafine particles. A month-long study of indoor air quality effects of GUV was undertaken in an unoccupied aged care facility in Melbourne, Australia under both mechanical ventilation (∼3 air changes h–1) and natural ventilation (∼1 h–1) conditions. Upper room GUV-254 and whole room GUV-222 devices were tested. GUV-222 produced ∼670 μg/h of ozone resulting in <1 ppb enhancements in indoor ozone. GUV-222 also produced small increases in OVOCs, particularly acetic acid and methanol, that were <1 ppb with mechanical ventilation, and <2 ppb with natural ventilation. Small acetaldehyde enhancements (∼0.1 ppb) were associated with GUV-254. GUV was not associated with changes in indoor particles. GUV-222 and -254 initiated OVOC enhancements were insensitive to indoor ozone but exhibited strong temperature and humidity sensitivities, suggesting UV-initiated surface chemistry rather than gas phase chemistry as the key driver of GUV OVOC enhancements.

The concentrations of circulating omega-3 PUFA (including total omega-3 and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) were measured by using a targeted high-throughput nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics platform. Land-use regression models were used to estimate concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) for each individual. Additionally, systemic inflammation levels were assessed using the low-grade inflammation score (INFLA-score) to elucidate the potential mechanism. We noted that the observed effects could be modified by circulating omega-3 PUFA levels (P-interaction < 0.05). Specifically, the significant pollutants-COPD associations were mainly observed in the lower circulating omega-3 PUFA groups. In contrast, there was no statistical evidence for increased COPD risk associated with air pollutants in subjects with higher circulating omega-3 PUFA. Mediation analysis further indicated that circulating omega-3 PUFA modified the air pollution-associated COPD risk might partly by reducing systemic inflammation.

The “Third Pole”, encompassing the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions, is home to the largest alpine permafrost on the Earth. Through analysis of 118 eddy covariance and chamber observations in the non‐growing season—a unique time window for examining soil CO2 loss, we report a negative elevation‐dependent pattern. More importantly, there is a negative elevation‐dependent pattern regarding the temperature sensitivities of CO2 loss, determined by the soil carbon content. We project that, compared to low elevations, future increases in CO2 loss will be lower at high elevations (>4,000 m) with lower soil organic carbon. The pattern of alpine soil CO2 loss, in which the higher the elevation and the colder it is, the less sensitive the loss is to warming, implies limited CO2 will be lost in the future from high‐elevation permafrost regions."

Here, the authors show that elevated PDGFRα signaling causes joint fusion in mice, as joint progenitors form fibrocartilage instead of synovial joint tissues. 
 Synovial joints develop from mesenchymal structures called interzones, with progenitor cells differentiating into specialized cartilaginous and fibrous tissues of the joint. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRα) is a tyrosine kinase expressed by cells of the limb bud, but its role in limb development is unknown. To investigate PDGFRα function, we generated mice expressing mutant PDGFRα with a point mutation (D842V) that increases receptor signaling. Mutant hindlimbs are immobile with knee joints fused by cartilage and lacking ligaments and menisci. The interzone marker Gdf5 is initially expressed at E12.5 but is downregulated thereafter, suggesting a defect in interzone maintenance. Omics analysis of the joint tissues identifies ectopic cartilage matrix expressing genes for cartilage and fibrotic tissue. Thus, elevated PDGFRα signaling corrupts joint development by downregulating Gdf5 and redirecting interzone progenitors into a fibrocartilage fate. This suggests that tight regulation of tyrosine kinase activity is necessary for the development of the mouse knee joint. While the embryonic limb bud expresses PDGFRα, its role during limb development is unknown.

 Swine Influenza A Virus (IAV-S) poses a significant burden to both the pork industry and public health. Current vaccines against IAV-S are infrequently updated and induce strain-specific immunity. Computational platforms have recently emerged as a promising strategy to develop new-age vaccines. Here, we describe the Epigraph, a computationally derived and epitope optimized set of vaccine immunogens. When compared to wildtype immunogens (WT) and a commercial comparator (FluSure XP®), pigs immunized with Epigraph demonstrate significantly improved breadth and magnitude of antibody responses. Further, pigs immunized with Epigraph show more robust and a wider breadth of cross-reactive cell-mediated immune responses than pigs immunized with WT immunogens. In an experimental infection model, Epigraph immunized pigs demonstrate a significant reduction of clinical disease, lower shedding of infectious virus, reduction of lung lesions, and lower microscopic immunopathology compared to the other immunization groups. These data support the continued investigation of computationally designed and epitope optimized vaccine immunogens against influenza A virus.

This study shows that these phases arise from species’ spatial distributions, providing a unified framework to predict phase transitions across ecosystems. 
 The nested species-area relationship, obtained by counting species in increasingly larger areas in a nested fashion, exhibits robust and recurring qualitative and quantitative patterns. When plotted in double logarithmic scales it shows three phases: rapid species increase at small areas, slower growth at intermediate scales, and faster rise at large scales. Despite its significance, the theoretical foundations of this pattern remain incompletely understood. Here, we develop a theory for the species-area relationship using extreme value theory, and show that the species-area relationship is a mixture of the distributions of minimum distances to a starting sampling focal point for each individual species. A key insight of our study is that each phase is determined by the geographical distributions of the species, i.e., their ranges, relative to the focal point, enabling us to develop a formula for estimating the number of species at phase transitions. We test our approach by comparing empirical species-area relationships for different continents and taxa with our predictions using Global Biodiversity Information Facility data. Although a SAR reflects the underlying biological attributes of the constituent species, our interpretations and use of the extreme value theory are general and can be widely applicable to systems with similar spatial features.

Here, the authors explore large-scale pattern of plant nutrient resorption and its relationship with soil nutrient supply across Tibetan alpine permafrost region. 
 Nutrient resorption is an important strategy for nutrient conservation, especially in permafrost ecosystems where plant growth is limited by nutrients. Based on the measurements mainly derived from tropical, subtropical and temperate regions, current projections suggest that resorption efficiency is higher for leaf nitrogen (N) than for phosphorus (P) in cold regions. However, these projections have not been fully validated due to the lack of observations in permafrost ecosystems. Here, we carry out a large-scale sampling campaign along a permafrost transect on the Tibetan Plateau. Our results show that, in contrast with the prevailing view, resorption efficiency is higher for leaf P than N in permafrost ecosystems (75.1 ± 1.8% vs. 58.7 ± 1.5%; mean ± standard error). Our results also reveal that leaf P resorption efficiency is higher in permafrost ecosystems than in global herbaceous plants, while there is no difference for leaf N resorption efficiency. Interestingly, there is a trade-off between leaf N resorption efficiency and soil N mineralization rate, but no such pattern exists for P. These results illustrate the unique characteristics of plant nutrient resorption in permafrost ecosystems and advance our understanding of nutrient conservation strategies in little-studied permafrost regions. Nutrient resorption is crucial for evaluating plant nutrient status and ecosystem carbon dynamics, but direct measurements in permafrost ecosystems are very limited.

 The spin-boson model, involving spins interacting with a bath of quantum harmonic oscillators, is a widely used representation of open quantum systems that describe many dissipative processes in physical, chemical and biological systems. Trapped ions present an ideal platform for simulating the quantum dynamics of such models, by accessing both the high-quality internal qubit states and the motional modes of the ions for spins and bosons, respectively. We demonstrate a fully programmable method to simulate dissipative dynamics of spin-boson models using a chain of trapped ions, where the initial temperature and the spectral densities of the boson bath are engineered by controlling the state of the motional modes and their coupling with qubit states. Our method provides a versatile and precise experimental tool for studying open quantum systems.

Here, the authors develop a network-based clustering method to predict subgroups of malignancies across disease subtypes. 
 Myeloid malignancies exhibit considerable heterogeneity with overlapping clinical and genetic features among subtypes. We present a data-driven approach that integrates mutational features and clinical covariates at diagnosis within networks of their probabilistic relationships, enabling the discovery of patient subgroups. A key strength is its ability to include presumed causal directions in the edges linking clinical and mutational features, and account for them aptly in the clustering. In a cohort of 1323 patients, we identify subgroups that outperform established risk classifications in prognostic accuracy. Our approach generalises well to unseen cohorts with classification based on our subgroups similarly offering advantages in predicting prognosis. Our findings suggest that mutational patterns are often shared across myeloid malignancies, with distinct subtypes potentially representing evolutionary stages en route to leukemia. With pancancer TCGA data, we observe that our modelling framework extends naturally to other cancer types while still offering improvements in subgroup discovery. Myeloid malignancies vary significantly in their clinical outcomes and their genetic background.

 There is concern that climate change might lead to abrupt and irreversible changes in parts of the Earth system at so-called tipping points. Theoretical considerations suggest that statistical measures can be used to detect early warning signals (EWSs) for reduced resilience, which could be interpreted as an increased proximity to climate tipping points. Here we discuss limitations of commonly used EWSs and their detection and discuss how alternative explanations can lead to resilience loss in the absence of tipping points. We argue for better testing of the existence of tipping points, beyond the application of EWSs, and propose a method to better quantify the probability of approaching tipping points using EWSs.

 In subduction zones, carbon-bearing fluids play a pivotal role in deep carbon cycling and global climate change. Given that Earth’s interior is dominated by silicates, the existence of aqueous carbon-silicon (C-Si) species is crucial for assessing the magnitude of return flux of carbon from subducting slabs to mantle wedges and ultimately Earth’s surface, yet it remains controversial. To resolve this controversy, we undertake a comprehensive in situ investigation of high pressure–temperature fluids employing optical cells and Raman spectroscopy under conditions comparable to those of previous studies. Under oxidizing conditions near the C-CO2 buffer, our findings show no evidence for C-Si species. Notably, under reducing conditions, a shoulder peak near the dominant CH4 peak, previously interpreted as evidence for C-Si speciation, emerges in high-temperature CH4-bearing fluids without silicates and even in pure CH4, suggesting it simply comes from CH4 hot bands. Therefore, C-Si species are unlikely in subduction-zone fluids.

 As the demand for single-use plastics rises, sustainable plastic management has become a pressing concern. Transforming plastic waste into value-added fuels is a promising waste-to-energy strategy that benefits environmental and energy security. In recent years, biochar-based catalysts (BBCs) have attracted increasing attention for their cost-effectiveness, well-developed pore structure, and effective surface functional groups in catalytic conversions of plastic waste into fuels. Many researchers have documented the successful utilization of biochar catalysts for efficient plastic waste valorization. However, a systematic review of biochar-based catalytic valorization of plastic waste into useful fuels is still missing. We assessed practical applications of biochar-based catalytic pyrolysis and advanced oxidation technologies, evaluating their performance from life-cycle and techno-economic perspectives. Machine learning was also introduced to design high-performance BBCs and optimize the plastic upcycling system.

 Accurate and timely forest disturbance mapping at large-scale is crucial for ecosystem protection and management. Sentinel-1 SAR data, with its all-weather capability and fine spatial-temporal resolutions, offers unique advantages for timely mapping of forest disturbance. Although deep learning models have been used for this purpose, they still struggle to fully exploit Sentinel-1 data's potential due to challenges in extracting multi-scale features and capturing context in complex landscape patterns. The advent of vision foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offer new possibilities to improve large-scale forest disturbance mapping with Sentinel-1 data. However, trained with natural images, SAM had difficulty processing speckle noises in SAR and recognizing intricate forest disturbance patterns; additionally, challenges remained in developing model transfer strategies and improving model efficiency for large-scale applications. To address these issues, we propose SAMSR, a SAM-based framework adapted for forest disturbance mapping using time series Sentinel-1 data by adding CNN branches and cross-branch attention modules to enhance fine spatial details. Firstly, we evaluated SAMSR's performances against SAM, U-Net and DeepLabv3+ at four global disturbance hotspots with large variations in environmental conditions (Rondônia in Brazil, Guangxi in China, California in USA, and Hainan in China). Then, we test the model's transferability using fine-tuned transfer learning to identify the best transfer strategy and explore the potential of active learning to further enhance model efficiency. The results indicated that the SAMSR (IoU 0.50–0.78; F1 0.67–0.88) outperformed SAM, U-Net and DeepLabv3+ for about 23.08 %, 3.23 % and 1.59 % in IoU, respectively, while the multi-region model achieved optimal transfer performance (IoU 0.60–0.77; F1 0.75–0.87). Moreover, applying active learning can meet the saturation accuracy of traditional method with about 20 %–70 % less training samples, significantly reducing costs for fine-tuning the foundational model. This study thus provides a novel and efficient framework for large-scale forest disturbance monitoring at fine spatial-temporal resolutions, which could be critical for forest protection and ecological studies."

 Semantic segmentation models present significant work in land-use/land-cover (LULC) mapping. Even though vision transformers (ViT) with long-sequence interactions have recently emerged as popular solutions alongside convolutional neural networks (CNN), they remain less effective for high-resolution remote sensing data characterized by small volumes and rich heterogeneities. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN and ViT collaborated segmentation framework (CTSeg) to address these weaknesses. Following the encoder-decoder architecture, we first introduce an encoding backbone with multifarious attention mechanisms to respectively capture global and local contexts. It is designed with parallel dual branches where the position-relation aggregation (PRA) blocks and others with channel relations (CRA) form the CNN-based encoding module, whereas the ViT-based one comprises multi-stage window-shifted transformer (WST) blocks with cross-window interactions. We further explore the online knowledge distillation presented with pixel-wise and channel-wise feature distillation modules to facilitate bidirectional learning between the CNN and ViT backbones, supported by a well-designed loss decay strategy. In addition, we develop a multiscale feature decoding module to produce more high-quality segmentation predictions where the leveraged correlation-weighted fusions emphasize the heterogeneous feature representations. Extensive comparison and ablation studies on two benchmark datasets demonstrate its competitive performance in efficient LULC mapping."

 Accurately mapping crop types in smallholder farming regions is crucial for monitoring crop dynamics and estimating production but remains challenging, especially over large extents. Remote sensing based crop mapping studies in smallholder farming regions often focus on major crops and the challenge of mapping small fields. However, minor but possibly emerging crops are often overlooked, nor is the impact of environmental factors, such as water stress, on mapping accuracy considered. This study addresses these gaps by categorizing crop fields into different types and assessing mapping accuracy for both major and minor crops within each field type. We first categorized crop fields into four field types (big/small fields with/without water stress) based on field size and the shortwave infrared water stress index (SIWSI) derived from Sentinel-2 (S2). Crop mapping accuracies for different field types and crops (maize as a major crop and soybean as a minor crop) were compared at pixel-based (PB) and object-based (OB) levels using random forest classification applied to S2 and two additional publicly accessible multispectral datasets (PlanetScope with four bands (PS4) and eight bands (PS8)). The season-averaged SIWSI (SIWSImean) provided a useful categorization of field types, as it is sensitive to mapping accuracy and is independent from field size. Based on S2 data, big fields without water stress can be most accurately mapped (F1-score = 0.89 for maize and 0.85 for soybean), followed by small fields without water stress (0.85 and 0.68) and big fields with water stress (0.82 and 0.59), while small fields with water stress are the most challenging type (0.77 and 0.37). Despite that the use of PS8 data with higher spatial resolution and OB classification improved mapping accuracy for small soybean fields with water stress, limitations to map such fields remain (F1-score < 0.50). This study provides a new perspective on crop type mapping in smallholder farming regions by using a simple and relevant categorization of field types and offers valuable insights on potentials and limitations for large-scale crop type mapping using machine learning algorithms."

It also analyzed the correlation among 86 VIs from global satellite data and assessed the sensitivity of 16 VIs to different parameters using radiative transfer model simulations at leaf and canopy scales. This review revealed that (1) VI research accelerated since 1986, particularly after 2012, largely due to the availability of earth-observing satellite data and new VIs. (2) The central concern of VI is its sensitivity to vegetation parameters, with recent interest in complex terrain effects. (3) VI is difficult to distinguish structural and spectral information. Optimization of soil-adjusted vegetation indices (OSAVI) has the highest sensitivity to leaf area index (LAI), and Sentinel-2 red edge position (S2REP) has the highest sensitivity to chlorophyll among the 16 selected VIs. Overall, VI performance depends on band selection and formula, with an ideal VI balancing sensitivity to vegetation and interference resistance.

 Land surface temperature (LST) is an indispensable factor for comprehending of surface equilibrium state on the Earth. In particular, satellites can continuously provide LST data and support the large-scale monitoring of LST with a high temporal resolution; however, satellite data may be easily contaminated by clouds. Previous satellite-based all-sky LST reconstruction approaches have inherent limitations, such as low temporal resolution and insufficient consideration of cloud effects. Therefore, this study aims to propose a novel methodology for all-sky 2-km hourly LST reconstruction from GEO-KOMPSAT-2A (GK2A) using machine learning and timely weighted accumulated radiation to reflect the temporal variation of cloud effects. The light gradient boosting machine approach used the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis-Land variables (i.e., LST, 2 m air temperature, evaporation, and wind), GK2A products (i.e., short and longwave radiation, and binary cloud cover), and auxiliary variables including geographic variables as independent variables. The GK2A LST and in situ measurements were used as dependent variables. The proposed model showed robust spatial agreement with GK2A LST under clear-sky conditions when conducting five-fold spatial cross-validation, with coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.97–0.99. In the leave one station-out cross-validation using 36 in situ data under all-sky conditions, the proposed model showed high performance with R2 values of 0.86–0.97, root mean square error values of 1.42–2.60 °C, and bias values of −0.49–0.23 °C. In a comparison of the proposed model with two scenarios and previous research investigating the effect of accumulated radiation, we demonstrated that the use of accumulated radiation was effective in reconstructing cloudy-sky LST, particularly during the daytime, as evident from the variable analysis conducted through Shapley additive explanations. Using the proposed model, we successfully reconstructed a spatiotemporally seamless LST, which can serve as a fundamental dataset for hourly heat-related research, such as hourly heat flow estimation and urban heat island analysis."

 Information regarding the spatial arrangement and extent of past habitats is important for understanding present biodiversity, restoration potential, and fighting extinction-debt effects. European landscapes have changed profoundly over recent decades, with the trend accelerating following World War 2. We develop a proof of concept for mapping historic habitat distribution for Switzerland from black and white aerial imagery compatible with the present-day habitat map. Recently available orthorectified 1946 aerial imagery (1 m resolution) was segmented based on spectral and shape characteristics for training areas (320–508 km2) representing the main biogeographical regions of Switzerland. Initial training data was derived by manual aerial orthoimage interpretation differentiating 15 habitat classes. A random forest model was trained to classify the segments using variables describing spectral information, image texture, segment shape, topography, climate, and anthropogenic influence. Classification accuracy was improved with additional training samples derived in a stepwise approach, applying three different sampling techniques. Highest class accuracies (producer’s and user’s accuracies ≥ 0.75) were achieved for the habitats ‘Standing water’, ‘Flowing water’, ‘Glaciers, permanent ice and snow’, and ‘Forests and other wooded land’. Particularly low user’s accuracies were found for ‘Wetlands’, ‘Hedges and tree rows’ and ‘Buildings’. The comparison to independent data further revealed minor differences in overall accuracy for the three different sampling strategies. Yet, map predictions sometimes varied substantially, indicating that the sampling strategies address different classification issues. Hence, we conclude that combining different sampling strategies for training data collection has the potential to improve the mapping, particularly in the case of multi-class classifications."

 Existing scene classification methods allocate the same computational resources, i.e., all model parameters in the neural network, to each remote sensing image whenever from any geographic scene. However, this might be redundant for images of certain scenes that are easy to discriminate, e.g., homogeneous scenes. This observation motivates us to propose an efficient method for on-orbit scene classification, namely, the Scale Boosting Model (SBM). Specifically, during the training process, the SBM is built as a set of different scale learners in a scale-increasing manner, each of which is used to learn and classify image features at a specific scale. During inference, the scale learners in the SBM will be selectively run in a scale-increasing manner and automatically decide when to exit early or expand the computation according to the scene complexity. In addition, by replacing the backbone of the scale learner, the SBM could provide a deployment possibility for computationally limited models for on-orbit processing, thereby reducing their computational requirements. Extensive experiments on UC Merced Land Use, NWPU-RESISC45 and RSD46-WHU datasets show that the SBM achieved a more effective classification performance more efficiently."

 Vehicular traffic is a major source of urban air pollution in Southeast Asia (SEA), posing significant health risks to pedestrians due to exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), black carbon (BC), and ultrafine particles (UFPs). Despite this issue of health concern, limited data exists linking the spatial and temporal variations of these pollutants and related pedestrian exposure in the region. Due to the unique urban topography, road infrastructure, and meteorological conditions in SEA, high-resolution air quality monitoring studies are essential to better understand pedestrian exposure patterns. This study addresses this knowledge gap by conducting a comprehensive real-time mobile measurement campaign in Singapore as a case study, using portable instruments to assess pedestrian exposure to the traffic-derived air pollutants across diverse urban road categories. We developed three land-use regression (LUR) models to identify the determinants and spatial distributions of PM2.5, BC, and UFP concentrations along the pedestrian pathways. Unlike previous stationary or vehicular-based LUR studies, our walking-based approach represents an effective assessment of pedestrian exposure. The results showed mean levels of PM2.5, BC and UFPs ranged from 16.4 to 20.0 μg m−3, 2.2–5.8 μg m−3 and 11.3 × 103 to 31.7 × 103 # cm-3, respectively, with BC and UFPs more strongly correlated with vehicular traffic emissions than PM2.5, particularly near highways and major arterial roads. Urban greenery, including tree density and park areas, was found to significantly reduce pedestrian exposure. These findings provide insights into the relationship between urban design, traffic patterns, and pedestrian health, offering strategies to mitigate traffic-related air pollution and promote healthier cities in SEA."

Thériault,Quantification of the impact of latent heat associated with the freezing of supercooled drops at the surface during freezing rain over Eastern Canada,"•Latent heat associated with freezing rain contributes to the increase of the low-level air temperature. •The latent heat associated with freezing rain may limit freezing rain amount. •Thermal advection and freezing rain onset temperature can also impact precipitation transition from freezing rain to rain. 
 The formation of winter precipitation is driven by ice-phase and liquid-phase processes, with the energy required for melting and freezing affecting both temperature and precipitation type. A major freezing rainstorm occurred in early April 2023 over Eastern Canada, causing damage to infrastructure and impacting the economy. The goal of this study is to investigate the impact of the latent heat release associated with freezing rain on the 2-m air temperature and the type of precipitation that reaches the surface. To illustrate the impacts of latent heat, the April storm was simulated using the Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM) model with the modified Predicted Particle Properties (P3) scheme. It was observed that the release of latent heat from freezing rain led to a rise in the 2-m air temperature, with rain recorded when temperatures exceeded 0 °C. The median cumulative freezing rain showed a 34.4 % decrease, while time for the median temperature to reach 0 °C decreased by 2.5 h. The results from the model suggest that temperature advection played a role in balancing the precipitation phase change. This study contributes to our knowledge of processes associated with maintaining or stopping freezing rain and improves our ability to mitigate its hazards."

 In this study, we used a two-and-a-half-decade dataset (1998–2023) of cirrus cloud properties obtained from a ground-based LIDAR located at the National Atmospheric Research Laboratory (NARL), Gadanki (13.5°N, 79.2°E), India. The percentage occurrence of cirrus clouds during the observational period is 42 %, and the most probable altitude is around 14.2 km. Significant seasonal variability in cirrus clouds is observed, with the highest frequency (74 %) during the monsoon season and the lowest (31 %) in winter. A detailed analysis was conducted on cirrus macro-physical, thermodynamic, and optical properties. Additionally, we investigated the long-term trends of the Tropical Tropopause Layer (TTL) to better understand its relationship with cirrus cloud properties. We observed a significant increasing trend in TTL thickness (0.003 ± 0.0005 km year−1) and Cold point Tropopause Height (CPH) (0.003 ± 0.0003 km year−1) while cirrus base (−0.003 ± 0.001 km year−1), top (−0.005 ± 0.001 km year−1), and geometrical thickness (−0.01 ± 0.0005 km year−1) showed a decreasing trend over the observational period. We also analysed long-term trends of sub-visible, thin and thick cirrus clouds. A significant decreasing trend was found in the mid-cloud altitudes of sub-visible (−0.003 ± 0.001 km year−1), thin (−0.006 ± 0.0009 km year−1), and thick cirrus (−0.008 ± 0.0009 km year−1) clouds, along with an increasing trend in mid-cloud altitude temperatures (0.035 ± 0.008 km year−1, 0.03 ± 0.007 km year−1, 0.05 ± 0.009 km year−1) over the last 25 years. Additionally, a significant decreasing trend was noted in the geometrical thickness of sub-visible cirrus clouds and in the optical thickness of thin and thick cirrus clouds. The ground-based climatology obtained from the NARL lidar was compared with 18 years (2006–2023) of data obtained from the Cloud-Aerosol LIDAR with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) satellite. Both datasets generally exhibit good agreement but differ in the magnitudes of several cirrus cloud properties, an important factor for understanding the radiative impacts of these cirrus clouds."
