We use MAGICC7, a reduced complexity climate-carbon cycle model, to quantify how emissions traced to the Carbon Majors, the world’s 122 largest fossil fuel and cement producers, from 1854–2020 contributed to present-day surface air temperature rise, and sea level rise both historically and projected through 2300. We find that emissions traced to these industrial actors have contributed 37%–58% to present day surface air temperature rise and 24%–37% to the observed global mean sea level rise to date. Critically, these emissions through 2020 are expected to contribute an additional 0.26–0.55 m of global sea level rise through 2300. We find that attribution of past emissions to projected future sea level rise is robust regardless of how emissions trajectories evolve in the coming centuries."

This new chemistry accounts for the formation of sulfate via aqueous oxidation of SO2 in aerosol liquid water and the formation of hydroxymethanesulfonate (HMS) – often confused by measurement techniques as sulfate. Model performance in predicting sulfur PM2.5 in Fairbanks, Alaska, and other places that experience dark and cold winters is improved. 
 A portion of Alaska's Fairbanks North Star Borough was designated as nonattainment for the 2006 24 h fine particulate matter 2.5 µm or less in diameter (PM2.5) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) in 2009. PM2.5 NAAQS exceedances in Fairbanks mainly occur during dark and cold winters, when temperature inversions form and trap high emissions at the surface. Sulfate (SO42-), often the second-largest contributor to PM2.5 mass during these wintertime PM episodes, is underpredicted by atmospheric chemical transport models (CTMs). Most CTMs account for primary SO42- and secondary SO42- formed via gas-phase oxidation of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and in-cloud aqueous oxidation of dissolved S(IV). Dissolution and reaction of SO2 in aqueous aerosols are generally not included in CTMs but can be represented as heterogeneous reactive uptake and may help better represent the high SO42- concentrations observed during Fairbanks winters. In addition, hydroxymethanesulfonate (HMS), a particulate sulfur species sometimes misidentified as SO42-, is known to form during Fairbanks winters. Heterogeneous formation of SO42- and HMS in aerosol liquid water (ALW) was implemented in the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system. CMAQ simulations were performed for wintertime PM episodes in Fairbanks (2008) as well as over the Northern Hemisphere and Contiguous United States (CONUS) for 2015–2016. The added heterogeneous sulfur chemistry reduced model mean sulfate bias by ∼ 0.6 µg m−3 during a cold winter PM episode in Fairbanks, AK. Improvements in model performance are also seen in Beijing during wintertime haze events (reducing model mean sulfate bias by ∼ 2.9 µg S m−3). This additional sulfur chemistry also improves modeled summertime SO42- bias in the southeastern US, with implications for future modeling of biogenic organosulfates."

Compared to our previous study, new satellite-based CO2 inversions were included and an updated mask of managed lands was used, improving agreement for Brazil and Canada. The proposed methodology can be regularly applied as a check to assess the gap between top-down inversions and bottom-up inventories. 
 In this study, we provide an update on the methodology and data used by Deng et al. (2022) to compare the national greenhouse gas inventories (NGHGIs) and atmospheric inversion model ensembles contributed by international research teams coordinated by the Global Carbon Project. The comparison framework uses transparent processing of the net ecosystem exchange fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) from inversions to provide estimates of terrestrial carbon stock changes over managed land that can be used to evaluate NGHGIs. For methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), we separate anthropogenic emissions from natural sources based directly on the inversion results to make them compatible with NGHGIs. Our global harmonized NGHGI database was updated with inventory data until February 2023 by compiling data from periodical United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) inventories by Annex I countries and sporadic and less detailed emissions reports by non-Annex I countries given by national communications and biennial update reports. For the inversion data, we used an ensemble of 22 global inversions produced for the most recent assessments of the global budgets of CO2, CH4, and N2O coordinated by the Global Carbon Project with ancillary data. The CO2 inversion ensemble in this study goes through 2021, building on our previous report from 1990 to 2019, and includes three new satellite inversions compared to the previous study and an improved managed-land mask. As a result, although significant differences exist between the CO2 inversion estimates, both satellite and in situ inversions over managed lands indicate that Russia and Canada had a larger land carbon sink in recent years than reported in their NGHGIs, while the NGHGIs reported a significant upward trend of carbon sink in Russia but a downward trend in Canada. For CH4 and N2O, the results of the new inversion ensembles are extended to 2020. Rapid increases in anthropogenic CH4 emissions were observed in developing countries, with varying levels of agreement between NGHGIs and inversion results, while developed countries showed a slowly declining or stable trend in emissions. Much denser sampling of atmospheric CO2 and CH4 concentrations by different satellites, coordinated into a global constellation, is expected in the coming years. The methodology proposed here to compare inversion results with NGHGIs can be applied regularly for monitoring the effectiveness of mitigation policy and progress by countries to meet the objectives of their pledges.

The dataset supports weather forecasting, aviation safety, and low-altitude flight planning, aiding China’s growing low-altitude economy and accessible at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14959025. 
 Low-level atmospheric turbulence plays a critical role in cloud dynamics and aviation safety. Nevertheless, height-resolved turbulence profiles remain scarce, largely owing to observational challenges. By leveraging collocated radar wind profiler (RWP) and radiosonde observations from 29 stations across China during 2023, a high-resolution dataset of low-level turbulence-related parameters are generated based on spectral width method. This dataset includes squared Brunt–Vaisala frequency (N2), turbulent dissipation rate (ε), and vertical eddy diffusivity (κ), inner scale (l0), and buoyancy length scale (LB), which are provided twice daily at 00 and 12 UTC with a vertical resolution of 120 m, covering altitudes from 0.12 km to 3.0 km above ground level. Spatial analysis reveals significant regional disparities in turbulence-related parameters across China, where ε, κ and LB are higher in northwest and north China compared to south China, while N2 and l0 display an inverse spatial pattern. This contrasting geographical distributions suggest distinct atmospheric instability across China. In terms of seasonality, turbulence-related variables showed maxima during spring and summer. Vertical profiles characteristics show distinct altitudinal dependencies, ε, LB and κ exhibit progressive attenuation with altitude, while N2 and l0 increase with height. Statistical analysis indicates that ε and κ follow log-normal distributions, whereas l0 and LB align with Gamma distributions. This dataset is publicly accessible https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14959025 (Meng and Guo, 2025), which provides crucial insights into the fine-scale structural evolution of low-level turbulence. The preliminary findings based on the dataset have great implications for improving our understanding of pre-storm environment and conducting scientific planning and guiding of low-level flight routes in the emerging low-altitude economy in China."

HGFM can produce forecasts at a spatial scale of ~6 km in tropics. It demonstrates improved accuracy in short- to medium-range weather prediction over the Indian region, with notable success in predicting extreme events. Further, the model will be entrusted to operational forecasting agencies after validation and testing. 
 The prediction of Indian monsoon rainfall variability, affecting a country with a population of billions, remained one of the major challenges of the numerical weather prediction community. While in recent years, there has been a significant improvement in the prediction of the synoptic-scale transients associated with the monsoon circulation, the intricacies of rainfall variability remained a challenge. Here, an attempt is made to develop a global model using a dynamic core of a cubic octahedral grid that provides a higher resolution of 6.5 km over the global tropics. This high-resolution model has been developed to resolve the monsoon convection. Reforecasts with the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) High-Resolution Global Forecast Model (HGFM) have been run daily from June through September 2022. HGFM has a wavenumber truncation of 1534 in the cubic octahedral grid. The monsoon events have been predicted with a 10 d lead time. HGFM is compared to the operational Global Forecast System (GFS) T1534. While HGFM provides skills comparable to GFS, it shows better skills for higher precipitation thresholds.

We propose a framework to assess model performance. In the framework, convective cells are identified and tracked in the forecasts and observations, and the model skill is then evaluated by comparing differences between forecast and observed cells. We demonstrate the framework with four open-source models. 
 The rapid temporal evolution of convective rainfall poses a challenge for quantitative rainfall nowcasting models that forecast rainfall on timescales ranging from 5 min to 6 h. With the growing potential of machine learning models for precipitation nowcasting to produce realistic-looking nowcasts for long lead times, it is important to investigate whether the nowcasts also produce realistic development for convective rainfall. Common verification metrics traditionally used to validate nowcasting models are often dominated by large-scale stratiform rainfall, and averaging the metrics across entire precipitation fields obscures how accurately the models replicate individual convective cells, which makes it difficult to distinguish the model skill for the growth and decay of convective rainfall. In this study, we present a framework based on the tracking of convective cells to investigate how accurately nowcasting models reproduce the development of convective rainfall. In the framework, a cell identification and tracking algorithm is applied first to the input observation rainfall fields and then separately to the target observation and nowcast rainfall fields where the tracks identified in the input observations are continued. Features describing the cells and cell tracks, such as the cell volume rain rate and area, are then extracted. In addition to the errors in these feature values, the models' skill in reproducing the existence of convective cells is estimated by calculating several contingency table metrics, such as the critical success index. The results allow the analysis of how accurately the models reproduce the growth and decay of convective rainfall and quantify the differences between the models, for example, due to differences in how the models smooth the nowcasts (i.e. blurring). The framework also allows differentiation of the results based on the initial conditions of the cell tracks, demonstrated here by separating the tracks into decaying or growing cell tracks based on the cell status when the nowcast is created. We demonstrate the framework with four open-source nowcasting models: the advection nowcast, the S-PROG (Spectral Prognosis; Seed, 2003) and LINDA (Lagrangian Integro-Difference equation model with Autoregression; Pulkkinen et al., 2021) models from the pysteps library, and the L-CNN (Lagrangian Convolutional Neural Network; Ritvanen et al., 2023) model, with data from the Swiss radar network. The results indicate that the L-CNN model reproduced the existence of convective cells best among the models and had smaller errors in the cell volume rain rate than LINDA and S-PROG. LINDA had the smallest underestimation in the cell mean rain rate, whereas S-PROG significantly overestimated the cell volume rain rate and area because of blurring."

As filter-feeding organisms, marine mussels are particularly vulnerable to microplastics. Moreover, phthalic acid esters (PAEs) are known to leach from microplastics under various environmental conditions. Among PAEs, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a common endocrine disruptor. We investigated the effects of microplastics and plasticizers on the reproductive function of the female mussel Mytilus coruscus. The results revealed that environmental exposure to DEHP and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) triggered molecular changes by allowing DEHP to act as an antiestrogen by binding with estrogen receptors (ER), thereby constituting the molecular initiating event. Key events were the suppression of ER, cytochrome P450–3 (CYP3), and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD) gene expressions, which reduced estradiol and progesterone levels in ovarian tissues. Ultimately adverse outcomes occurred: antioxidant capacity in ovarian tissue was impaired, hindering ovarian development and reducing reproductive function. This study introduces a novel adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework focusing on reproductive impairment in shellfish. By integrating experimental findings with the AOP concept, the research provides essential data for understanding the toxicological effects of microplastic pollutants on mussels. This framework offers valuable insights for risk assessment, contributing to a better understanding of how microplastics and plasticizers threaten marine life."

However, this hypothesis remains untested. This study tested the hypothesis through mesocosm experiments, confirming that rainwater-borne hydrogen peroxide triggered hydroxyl radical (•OH) generation, elevating soil redox potential, and oxidizing arsenite to less phytoavailable arsenate in soil porewater, thereby reducing As uptake by rice and As accumulation in rice grain. Comparison between two crops of rice cultivation with different fluxes of rainwater-borne hydrogen peroxide confirms that seasonal rainfall variation has an impact on accumulation of rice grain-borne arsenic, with paddy soil receiving more rainfall having a lower arsenic concentration in the rice grain compared to that receiving less rainfall. Using China’s major rice-producing region as an example, it is demonstrated that spatial variation in rainfall regime could impact the geographical distribution of rice grain-borne As at a national scale. The findings have implications for the assessment and management of the environmental risk from arsenic-contaminated rice grains."

The determinants of emission variability among individual flights remain inadequately understood, thereby hindering the development of effective mitigation strategies. Here, employing an extensive flight tracking data set (Flightradar24), we assess the interflight variability in CO2 emissions from global aviation with an unprecedented level of spatial and temporal granularity─down to meters and seconds, respectively. In 2019, 2020, and 2021, global aviation emitted 899 [696–1122], 469 [363–581], and 542 [418–672] Tg CO2, respectively. Based on this trajectory-level CO2 emission data set, we develop reduced-form models for over two hundred standard aircraft types that capture this flight-to-flight variability. These models offer a novel tool for understanding why emissions differ across individual flights and routes, providing crucial insights to support targeted emission reduction measures within the aviation sector. Further analysis reveals that optimizing airport flight scheduling and route planning can significantly reduce emissions. Airports with moderate flight volumes exhibit the greatest potential for relative emission reductions (51.6%, 0.12 Tg·year–1), whereas those with the highest flight volumes offer the most substantial absolute reduction potentials (12.9%, 1.39 Tg·year–1).

Raff,Photosensitizers Regulate Nitrate Photoproduct Yields in Bulk Aqueous Matrices,"Photolysis of nitrate (NO3–) in the presence of photosensitizers is thought to promote the release of atmospherically important reactive nitrogen species (NOy), such as HONO, via mechanisms that are poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted photochemistry studies on mixtures of NO3–, a model photosensitizer [4-benzoylbenzoic acid (4-BBA)], and various aliphatic organic matter proxies. We found that aliphatic organic matter enhances the production of NOy and superoxide (O2–) from bulk aqueous nitrate photolysis, while the addition of 4-BBA decreases NOy and O2– yields in most cases. This effect was not observed in heterogeneous systems, where 4-BBA enhanced photochemical NOy production when coadsorbed with NO3– on silica surfaces. This demonstrates that photosensitizers act as both oxidants and reductants, regulating the yields of NOy and reactive oxygen species from nitrate photochemistry. Given sufficient residence time in the bulk aqueous phase, nitrate photoproducts can be scavenged via secondary reactions with photosensitizers. In heterogeneous and aerosol systems with high surface area-to-volume ratios, however, volatilization of NOy photoproducts is favored, and NOy production is less affected by chromophoric organic matter sinks in the bulk phase. This work demonstrates the intricate role of aliphatic and chromophoric moieties in natural organic matter in the photochemical conversion of NO3– to NOy (i.e., renoxification) in the atmosphere."

Herein, we investigated 277 chemical pollutants from 367 sampling points across 10 rounds, totaling 1,016,590 measured data points. An environmental health prioritization index (EHPI) was proposed and applied to integrate multiple criteria: occurrence, migration, persistence, bioaccumulation, acute and chronic toxicity, and health effects to rank the target pollutants for priority control. Thirty pollutants were classified as the top-priority group and 81 as high-priority, with metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and haloalkanes ranking highest, while emerging contaminants of concern ranked lower. The top 6 pollutants were beryllium, benzo(g,h,i)perylene, nickel, benzo(a)pyrene, chrysene, and arsenic. The EHPI method was compared against five other weighting schemes, including AHP (analytic hierarchy process), entropy, AHP-entropy, AHP-TOPSIS (technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution), and entropy-TOPSIS. EHPI effectively captured and integrated the results from more simplistic prioritization schemes. Overall, 38 pollutants are recommended for inclusion in the priority control list, focusing on the top-priority group and high detection and exceedance categories.

However, earlier reported treatment systems mostly suffer from side reactions against efficient and cost-effective production of 1O2, together with insufficient utilization of 1O2 limited by the extremely short diffusion length. To overcome the drawbacks, we here designed high-performance nanoreactors by modulating the MnO2 phase to nanotube structures (with ∼5 nm diameter, termed “NT5”). With nanoconfinement, our developed NT5 directed efficient and almost 100% utilization of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to produce 1O2 and achieved maximal kinetics on organic pollutant elimination. The mechanism study revealed that the geometric strain of NT5 together with spatial confinement modulated the adsorption properties of PMS molecules and led to their transformation to 1O2. To demonstrate the applicability of NT5, we developed a reactive filter with a particulate catalyst (NT5 grown on an alumina substrate) that can effectively and stably work in a broad range of contaminated scenarios (surface water, groundwater, municipal secondary effluent, and industrial wastewaters), due to the confined treatment together with the fouling-resistance nature.

However, fundamental aspects of this reaction remain poorly understood, limiting our comprehensive understanding of the nitrogen cycle. In this study, we present the first coupled measurements of nitrate and nitrite dual isotopes at natural abundance across the Antarctic summer to uncover the environmental factors influencing enzymatic isotopic exchange. East Antarctic surface waters exhibit the most anomalous nitrate and nitrite isotope signatures and a more pronounced equilibrium isotope effect compared to West Antarctica. This feature may be attributed to the regulation of enzymatic isotopic exchange reaction by temperature, and we infer that there might be a tipping point in the expression of its intensity. Given the warming of Antarctic waters due to global climate change, particularly in West Antarctic, we hypothesize that such reaction could have an amplified impact on nitrogen isotope dynamics.

Paleoproductivity records that can indicate seasonal wind dynamics are combined with modeling data. Seasonal southeasterly and northeasterly winds off Sumatra are both strengthened, meanwhile, anomalous westerly winds occur over the western Celebes Sea. This reflects a zonal “tripole” pattern of the changed convection that is weakened over the exposed Sunda and Sahul shelves and strengthened over the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean and western equatorial Pacific. Model results suggest that lower sea levels and larger ice sheets are responsible for these changes. Coupled with the changed atmospheric circulation, a positive Indian Ocean Dipole‐like mean state forms in the Indian Ocean.

This cannot, however, explain the observed high seismic strain rate, which requires PT to complete within seconds, while metastable olivine does not transform for over a million years. Recent theory quantitatively describes how severe plastic deformations (SPD) can solve this dilemma but lacking experimental proof. Here, we introduce dynamic rotational diamond anvil cell with rough diamond anvils to impose SPD on San Carlos olivine. While olivine never transformed to spinel at room temperature, we obtained reversible olivine‐ringwoodite PT under SPD at 15–28 GPa within tens of seconds. The PT pressure reduces with increasing dislocation density, microstrain, plastic strain, and decreasing crystallite size. Results demonstrate a new strain‐induced PT mechanism compared to a pressure/temperature‐induced one. Combined with SPD during olivine subduction, this mechanism can accelerate olivine‐ringwoodite PT from millions of years to timescales relevant to earthquakes."

We observe a low Vp and Vs layer in the upper mantle with Vp/Vs ratios exceeding 1.8, reaching up to 1.95 at the Moho. These high ratios indicate a strong serpentinized layer (>15 vol%) with significant changes in the mechanical properties of the serpentinized peridotite.

This study analyzes 12 years (2012–2023) of radiosonde data from five sites in the tropical western Pacific to examine the characteristics of inertial gravity wave (IGW) parameters and their interaction with the background flow. In the troposphere, IGWs exhibit larger vertical wavelengths and intrinsic frequencies compared to those in the stratosphere. Horizontal phase speeds in the troposphere are primarily between ±10 m/s with over half of IGWs propagating downward. In the stratosphere, horizontal phase speeds extend to ±20 m/s with most IGWs propagating upward. The troposphere shows a distinct annual cycle in mean meridional momentum flux and energy, peaking in winter and reaching a minimum in monsoon. Conversely, in the stratosphere, mean kinetic energy and zonal momentum flux of IGWs follow a quasi‐biennial cycle. This pattern is attributed to the distribution of IGW horizontal phase speeds and the Quasi‐Biennial Oscillation (QBO). Additionally, the slopes of temperature and horizontal wind spectra in the troposphere exhibit an annual cycle with minima (saturation) in winter and maxima (unsaturation) in the monsoon. In the stratosphere, temperature spectral slopes continue to show an annual cycle at altitudes between 18 and 24 km. However, at 24–30 km, horizontal wind spectral slopes fluctuate significantly, reflecting a quasi‐biennial cycle. By identifying these patterns, our study contributes to a better understanding of the interactions between gravity waves and the background wind field, which is essential for improving gravity wave parameterization in numerical models."

The impacts of stratospheric Quasi‐Biennial Oscillation (QBO) and tropospheric El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events on stratospheric circulation will affect the stratosphere‐to‐troposphere transport of ozone. In this study we use average of stratosphere‐tagged ozone tracer (O3S) from two chemistry‐climate models to quantify the downward transport of stratospheric ozone. We found that under the westerly QBO (WQBO) phase, less than the average stratospheric ozone is transported to the troposphere (2.5–6 ppbv O3S anomaly from 500 to 200 hPa in mid‐high latitudes). The opposite is true under the easterly QBO (EQBO) phase, accompanied by more stratospheric ozone transport to the troposphere (5–10 ppbv O3S anomaly from 500 to 200 hPa). The impact of ENSO events on the stratosphere‐to‐troposphere ozone transport shows a hemispheric asymmetry. The ozone transported into the troposphere decreases by about 2.5–6 ppbv from 500 to 200 hPa in the Northern Hemisphere under the warm ENSO phase, but shows almost the same amount of anomalous increase in the Southern Hemisphere. The situation is opposite during the cold ENSO phase. This variation in ozone transport in response to the QBO and ENSO is related to the stratospheric residual circulation variations. In a warming future climate, the frequency of El Niño events will increase while the amplitude of QBO is expected to decrease, thus affecting the stratospheric source of tropospheric ozone."

Both satellite observations in 2022 and subsequent chemistry‐climate model simulations forced by realistic Hunga perturbations reveal large‐scale cooling in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) tropical to subtropical stratosphere following the Hunga eruption. This study analyzes the drivers of this cooling, including the distinctive role of anomalies in water vapor, ozone, and sulfate aerosol concentration on the simulated climate response to the Hunga volcanic forcing, based on climate simulations with prescribed chemistry/aerosol. Simulated circulation and temperature anomalies based on specified‐chemistry simulations show good agreement with previous coupled‐chemistry simulations and indicate that each forcing of ozone, water vapor, and sulfate aerosol from the Hunga volcanic eruption contributed to the circulation and temperature anomalies in the SH stratosphere. Our results also suggest that (a) the large‐scale stratospheric cooling during the austral winter was mainly induced by changes in dynamical processes, not by radiative processes, and that (b) the radiative feedback from negative ozone anomalies contributed to the prolonged cold temperature anomalies in the lower stratosphere (∼70 hPa level) and hence to long lasting cold conditions of the polar vortex."

Here we examine ARs in a new set of high‐resolution (12–30 km) dynamically downscaled simulations from select CMIP6 models. We begin with a historical evaluation of AR properties from this model ensemble followed by future projections under a high emissions scenario. We demonstrate that by end‐of‐century, the maximum integrated vapor transport associated with ARs will robustly increase by as much as 20% $20\%$ in some regions of the South Pacific, and ARs contribute a larger proportion (up to 20% $20\%$ more) of the annual precipitation climatology in certain regions of New Zealand. The spatial structure and seasonality of these changes indicate the role of a poleward shift and intensification of the westerly jet. This is further quantified through a decomposition into dynamic and thermodynamic components. Although the thermodynamic change dominates the increase in AR frequency, the additional positive dynamical change is notable over the mid‐latitudes and southern New Zealand. Separating events using an AR categorization scale shows that higher category (longer duration, more intense) events more than double in frequency, underscoring the increasing role that ARs will play in extreme weather events in the future for this region."

However, the scarce spatial and temporal coverage in the Arctic of integrated water vapor (IWV) surface‐based observations limits the representativeness of satellite observations and reanalysis estimate validations. Recently, we validated sun photometer IWV (IWVsp) observations with IWV from radiosondes in the Arctic. Here, we compare the hourly means of IWVsp from 13 Arctic AERONET stations and the IWV from ERA‐5 and MERRA‐2 reanalyses. The comparison is conducted at hourly timescale for individual stations for two Arctic regions and for the whole Arctic. The comparison showed a moist bias of IWV from reanalyses with respect to IWVsp. The individual station wise pattern shows slightly better accuracy and precision for ERA5 than for MERRA‐2 also evident at the selected subregional scale.

While the role of satellite remote sensing (RS) is highly anticipated to address data needs and boost transparency, critical thought on what is feasible and how to strategically integrate its insights for ambitious corporate biodiversity and water disclosure is lagging behind. To address this, we propose applying a systems perspective to represent the complex, multi‐scale interactions between biodiversity, water systems, and corporate operations, and to guide how to integrate RS contributions to analyze the full spectrum of impacts and risks—ranging from direct and concurrent to cascading, cumulative, and emergent. We highlight seven guiding (non‐exhaustive) principles for leveraging satellite RS data to assess corporate biodiversity and water impacts and risks. This process requires an effective system boundary (1) set spatially, temporally, and process‐wise. Within which, biodiversity and water's multi‐dimensionality (2) needs to be addressed to monitor the spatio‐temporal dynamics (3) that characterize ecosystem responses. To attribute risk and impact of detected changes, interactions need to be defined by causality (4) and directionality (5), and ultimately consider compound impacts (6) across commodities, supply chains and portfolios, as well as cross‐system interactions (7), for example, between climate change, water and biodiversity. We review each of these principles and related challenges individually, providing a system theory definition, relevant RS capabilities, and research directions. Addressing these seven principles will be crucial to harness satellite RS's potential for comprehensive biodiversity and water disclosure for strong corporate accountability."

Here, we report six cryo-EM structures of human MPC in three different states: three structures obtained at different conditions in intermembrane space (IMS)-open state with highest resolution of 3.2 Å, a structure of pyruvate-treated MPC in occluded state at 3.7 Å, and two structures in matrix-facing state bound with the inhibitor UK5099 or an inhibitory nanobody on the matrix side at 3.2 Å and 3.0 Å, respectively. MPC is assigned into a heterodimer consisting of MPC1 and MPC2, with the transmembrane domain adopting pseudo-C2-symmetry. Approximate rigid body movements occur between the IMS-open state and the occluded state, while structural changes primarily on the matrix side facilitate the transition between the occluded state and the matrix-facing state, revealing the alternating access mechanism during pyruvate transport. In the UK5099-bound structure, the inhibitor fits well and interacts extensively with a pocket that opens to the matrix side. Our findings provide important insights into the mechanisms underlying MPC-mediated substrate transport, and the recognition and inhibition by UK5099, which will facilitate future drug development targeting MPC."

 Mitochondrial dynamics are orchestrated by protein assemblies that directly remodel membrane structure, however the influence of specific lipids on these processes remains poorly understood. Here, using an inducible heterodimerization system to selectively modulate the lipid composition of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), we show that local production of diacylglycerol (DAG) directly leads to transient tubulation and rapid fragmentation of the mitochondrial network, which are mediated by isoforms of endophilin B (EndoB) and dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), respectively. Reconstitution experiments on cardiolipin-containing membrane templates mimicking the planar and constricted OMM topologies reveal that DAG facilitates the membrane binding and remodeling activities of both EndoB and Drp1, thereby independently potentiating membrane tubulation and fission events. EndoB and Drp1 do not directly interact with each other, suggesting that DAG production activates multiple pathways for membrane remodeling in parallel. Together, our data emphasizes the importance of OMM lipid composition in regulating mitochondrial dynamics. Using complementary live cell approaches together with a powerful in vitro reconstitution system, this study demonstrates the direct regulation of mitochondrial dynamics by localized changes to the lipid composition of the outer membrane."

 Long-persistent luminescence (LPL) materials have applications from safety signage to bioimaging; however, existing organic LPL (OLPL) systems do not align with human scotopic vision, which is sensitive to blue light. We present a strategy to blueshift the emissions in binary OLPL systems by upconverting the charge-transfer (CT) to a locally excited (LE) singlet state. Through rigorous steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy and wavelength-resolved thermoluminescence measurements, we provide the direct experimental evidence for this upconversion in OLPL systems featuring small energy offsets between the lowest-energy CT and LE singlet states. These systems exhibited strong room temperature LPL, particularly when extrinsic electron traps are added. Importantly, the developed OLPL system achieved Class A (ISO 17398) LPL, matching well with human scotopic vision. The findings not only elucidate the role of small energy offsets in modulating LPL but also provide potential avenues for enhancing the efficiency and applicability of OLPL materials.

 Stability and translation of mRNAs, both endogenous and therapeutic, is determined by poly(A) tail. Direct RNA sequencing enables single-molecule measurements of poly(A) lengths, avoiding amplification bias. It also holds potential for observation of non-adenosines within poly(A), known to influence mRNA fate. However, there is no computational method to detect composite tails in Direct Sequencing data. To address this gap, we introduce the Ninetails, a neural network-based tool that accurately identifies and quantifies non-adenosines in poly(A) tails. Examination of different biological contexts revealed widespread non-adenosine decorations, with frequencies influenced by the origin of poly(A) tails differing by mRNA class, cell type, and species. Notably, substrates of cytoplasmic TENT5-polymerases and mitochondrially encoded mRNAs are enriched in composite tails. For mRNA therapeutics, we show that the composition of poly(A) tails in mRNA vaccines is dynamic during its cellular lifetime and that the manufacturing protocol of synthetic mRNAs affects the purity of poly(A) tails.

Here, authors explored the strained defect sites on CNTs for the chlorination process for water purification. The strain field effectively steers the free chlorine activation to achieve deep remediation of the water body. 
 Carbon nanotube (CNT)–based heterogeneous advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) used for water purification have been exploited for several decades. Many strategies for modifying CNTs have been utilized to improve their catalytic performance in remediation processes. However, the strain fields of the intrinsic defect sites on CNT steering AOPs (such as chlorination) have not yet been reported. Here, we explored the strained defect sites for steering the chlorination process for water purification. The strained defect sites with the elongated sp2 hybridized C–C bonds boost electronic reactivity with the chlorine molecules via the initial Yeager–type adsorption. As a result, the reactive species in chlorination can be regulated on demand, such as the ratio of high–selectivity ClO• ranging from 38.8% in conventional defect–based systems to 87.5% in our strain–dominated process, which results in the generation of harmless intermediates and even deep mineralization during 2,4–DCP abatement. This work highlights the role that strain fields have on controlling the extent of chlorination reactions. There is an urgent need to develop sustainable water remediation technologies.

Here authors discover that inhibition of guanine nucleotide biosynthesis leads to myeloid differentiation and sensitization to menin inhibitors in leukemia stem cells of MLLr leukemia. 
 Targeting the dependency of MLL-rearranged (MLLr) leukemias on menin with small molecule inhibitors has opened new therapeutic strategies for these poor-prognosis diseases. However, the rapid development of menin inhibitor resistance calls for combinatory strategies to improve responses and prevent resistance. Here we show that leukemia stem cells (LSCs) of MLLr acute myeloid leukemia (AML) exhibit enhanced guanine nucleotide biosynthesis, the inhibition of which leads to myeloid differentiation and sensitization to menin inhibitors. Mechanistically, targeting inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) reduces guanine nucleotides and rRNA transcription, leading to reduced protein expression of LEDGF and menin. Consequently, the formation and chromatin binding of the MLL-fusion complex is impaired, reducing the expression of MLL target genes. Inhibition of guanine nucleotide biosynthesis or rRNA transcription further suppresses MLLr AML when combined with a menin inhibitor. Our findings underscore the requirement of guanine nucleotide biosynthesis in maintaining the function of the LEDGF/menin/MLL-fusion complex and provide a rationale to target guanine nucleotide biosynthesis to sensitize MLLr leukemias to menin inhibitors.

With soft mechanical properties and enhanced electromechanical performance, wf-UMP can be robustly worn on curved and dynamic tissue surfaces for easy and effective manipulation. In preclinical studies involving mice, wf-UMP demonstrated notable anticancer effects by inducing tumor cell apoptosis, amplifying oxidative stress, and modulating immune cell proliferation. Furthermore, the synergistic immunotherapy induced by wf-UMP and Anti-PD1 further improved anticancer immunity by activating immunogenic cell death and regulating macrophages polarization, inhibiting distant tumor growth and tumor recurrence.

 Advances in spring phenology (SOS) and increases in terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) are well-documented. However, the impact of an earlier SOS on the duration and rate of carbon uptake (GPPrate) during the early growing season (EGS) remains unclear, leaving the overall influence of these factors on EGS GPP uncertain. Using satellite and carbon flux data across the Northern Hemisphere, we found that an earlier SOS extended EGS, but reduced the mean daily GPPrate during this period, primarily due to lower temperatures and soil-water content. While the extended EGS increased total EGS GPP, the reduction in EGS GPPrate lowered these gains by 30% on average, with a more pronounced reduction in arid regions (~ 85%) compared to humid areas (~ 15%). The diminished contribution of an advanced SOS to early-season productivity suggests that the current increase in carbon uptake in northern ecosystems may be offset by future warming and drought conditions.

 Magnetotelluric investigations can reconstruct features within magmatic systems, such as the distribution of melt and fluid and the volcano-tectonic structures. Here, we use this approach to image the subsurface beneath the active Campi Flegrei caldera, providing new details on the crustal structure down to 20 kilometers.

The magma plumbing system primarily manifests as a low resistivity anomaly located at 8–20 kilometers depth and interpreted as a mid-lower crustal mush zone containing ~10% melt. This zone transitions upwards through a channel-like low resistivity structure containing ~8% of melt and a medium resistivity sector where small lenses of heterogeneously distributed magma accumulate and cool.

 Marine heatwaves can amplify the vulnerabilities of regional marine ecosystems and jeopardise local economies and food resources. Here, we show that marine heatwaves in the tropical Atlantic have increased in frequency, intensity, duration, and spatial extent. Marine heatwaves are 5.1 times more frequent and 4.7 times more intense since the records started in 1982, with the 10 most extreme summers/falls in terms of marine heatwave cumulative intensity and spatial extension occurring in the last two decades. The extreme warming during the summer/fall of 2020 led to the largest bleaching event recorded along the Brazilian coast, with 85% of stony corals and 70% of zoanthids areas bleached in Rio do Fogo. The increase in the severity of the marine heatwaves in the western tropical Atlantic is not accompanied by trends in the strength of the local drivers. This suggests that weaker forcing can lead to more devastating marine heatwaves as the global ocean temperature rises due to climate change.

 Grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau play a crucial role in carbon sequestration and livestock farming. However, carbon storage and the environmental effects of grazing in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau grasslands are not well understood. Here, we utilised the advanced Biome-Biogeochemical Cycles with Multi-layer Soil Module model to evaluate carbon storage and responses to grazing in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau grasslands between 1979 and 2018. The average annual vegetation carbon density and soil organic carbon density were found to be 46.07 ± 7.19 gC/m² and 3,789.79 ± 17.08 gC/m², respectively. Grazing resulted in the loss of 21.63 tg of vegetation carbon, while soil organic carbon loss was 108.83 tg in 2018. Grazing was found to have reduced both vegetation carbon density and soil organic carbon density in most grasslands of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The study findings highlight the extent of carbon loss caused by unreasonable grazing practices.

 Decadal climate predictions are crucial for communities engaged in scenario planning under Sustainable Development Goals. However, uncertainties in future precipitation extremes hinder climate mitigation and adaptation efforts. Here we present a hybrid statistical climate-driven time-varying model to predict the Areal MEan Storm Erosivity Index, a key indicator of hydrological events, for the Mediterranean region. By integrating historical data (1884-2022) with large-scale (El Niño–Southern Oscillation) and small-scale (precipitation variability) climate forcings, our model captures past storm behavior and projects future dynamics. The Hurst exponent (0.63) suggests a long-term positive memory in Areal MEan Storm Erosivity Index, enhancing prediction accuracy. Projections show an Index increase until 2040, then a decline until 2050, and a resurgence. While consistent with other regional models at the interdecadal scale, finer variations are less pronounced at the interannual scale. This approach offers valuable insights into hydroclimate variability, aiding climate resilience planning in the Mediterranean and beyond.

 Öræfajökull, one of Iceland’s most dangerous volcanoes which last erupted in 1727 and 1362 Common Era, began to show signs of significant unrest between 2017 and 2019. This activity led to a change in the aviation color code, the establishment of evacuation routes, and increased monitoring. The unrest was characterized by pronounced seismic activity, ground swelling, and heightened geothermal phenomena, including melting of ice and increased discharge of geothermal waters. This rare event at Öræfajökull has provided an invaluable and novel opportunity to better understand the internal structure of the volcano and processes responsible for the onset of the unrest. Here, we utilize both seismic tomography and geodetic modelling to locate important volcanic-magmatic features beneath Öræfajökull. Our conceptual model posits three distinct structural zones within the volcano: a geothermally active system at shallow depths, the start of a magma domain/melt zone between ~2 and 6 kilometers depth below-sea-level, and a zone of higher-velocity intrusive rocks below ~6 kilometers below-sea-level. This study establishes a critical baseline for future periods of unrest at Öræfajökull, highlighting the potential for intermittent increased activity over decades in complex, dormant volcanoes before a significant eruption ensues.

 Overallocation of Colorado River water and groundwater alongside multidecadal drought underscore the need to understand water-resource dynamics. Here we assess water-storage variations using satellites, regional modeling, and monitoring to inform future management. Total water storage loss from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites was dominated by Lower Basin declines (80% of total), exceeding Lake Mead capacity by 40%. These Lower Basin storage declines were dominated by groundwater depletion (60% of total), with cumulative depletion hotspots ≤11 m (2002–2023) and subsidence ≤1 m (2010–2024). Regional groundwater modeling shows intensive depletion (1940s–1970s) followed by partial recovery since the early 1980s from irrigation reduction, wet climate cycles (early 1980s–1990s), and Colorado River water transfers to Central Arizona. Managed aquifer recharge and incidental recharge from imported surface-water irrigation led to a 3-m average groundwater-level rise in Central Arizona Active Management Areas (2000–2023). Projected declines in Colorado River water transfers to Central Arizona could lead to further depletion and subsidence. Water transfers from agricultural to municipal/industrial sectors would improve future management. Understanding system dynamics related to climate and human drivers is essential for developing future conjunctive surface-water and groundwater management strategies. Intense droughts and irrigation over the past century in the lower Colorado Basin have driven groundwater depletion and subsidence that has been partially alleviated by transfers from the Colorado River, according to analysis of satellite, groundwater modelling, and monitoring data."

 Rapid urbanization and global climate change are intensifying the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect in cities worldwide, with consequences for human health and well-being. Urban green spaces (UGSs) mitigate extreme temperatures, but their cooling potential depends on spatial configuration, size, shape, and distribution. This study fills a geographic gap by providing one of the first detailed analyses of UGSs-Land Surface Temperature (LST) dynamics in a North African context. It combines spatial pattern analysis with temporal trend detection to comprehensively evaluate UGSs-LST relationships in Algiers from 2004 to 2022, addressing a common limitation in the literature where these approaches are often treated separately. Using freely available satellite data and open-source tools—including Landsat data from Google Earth Engine (GEE), QGIS, and RStudio—we integrate supervised classification, landscape metrics (LMs) computation via our custom PyQGIS LMs calculator, and Mann-Kendall trend analysis to quantify the static spatial configuration of green spaces and their dynamic thermal impacts over time. Findings reveal a 38% decrease in green spaces and a 10% reduction in agricultural land, accompanied by increased urbanization. Strong negative correlations between some LMs and LST were observed, with PLAND (Percentage of Landscape) explaining 61% of LST variability at an optimal 600-meter scale. This medium-sized scale differs from previous findings in other regions, highlighting the importance of context-specific analysis. LST trend analysis identified specific heat-resistant zones characterized by large, contiguous green patches. Despite greening initiatives, UGSs in Algiers continue to decline, underlining the need to preserve and strategically expand UGSs to combat rising temperatures."

 Currently, studies show that only 10–30% at best of the organic matter dissolved in cloud water is characterized and sugars are among the compounds still unexplored. Numerous studies on the atmospheric particulate matter (PM) demonstrate their ubiquity, and their incorporation into cloud phase is therefore expected in light of their solubility.In this work, a large array of sugars are measured at low concentration levels with an innovative LC-MSMS technique in 28 cloud water samples collected at the puy de Dôme and their environmental variability is analyzed. The total sugar concentration reaches 4.0 μmol L−1, with an average value of 0.98 ± 0.94 μmol L−1, with no clear seasonal trend. This represents on average 1.2% of dissolved organic carbon but reaches up to 3.7% for one sample.

 The profuse winter rainfall over Taiwan's northern coastal mountain area (NCMA) was investigated and quantified, focusing on the associated daily weather types, for ten winters from November 2010 to February 2021. The dominant rainfall-producing system we identified is the boundary-layer-top clouds associated with the northeasterly monsoon (N-type weather), contributing 43 % to the rainfall and 55.6 % to rainy days. Rainfall from the N-type weather correlated highly with the surface winds, total column water (TCW), and the Oceanic Niño Index. While the rainfall depends linearly on TCW, a cubic dependence is found on the northerly wind speed. The N-type rainfall can be drastically enhanced when an overlaying cloud layer emerges in the lower free troposphere. The Oceanic Niño Index represents a large-scale influence on the East Asian winter monsoon, regulating winds and water vapor of the region. Regional-scale composite analysis substantiated such regional influences, with heavier NCMA rainfall associated with stronger Mongolian/Siberian High and enhanced moisture transport at the lower free troposphere over Taiwan. The NCMA winter rainfall shows significant decadal variation, but no apparent long-term trend can be observed from 1940 to 2023."

 The frequency, severity, and duration of wildfires are on the rise worldwide, underscoring the importance of comprehending the health impacts of wildfire exposure. The main aim of this work is to examine the effects that the Northern Greece forest fires during August 2023 had on regional air quality levels. On August 21st, a massive forest fire started within the Dadia Forest National Park, a protected area, nearby the city of Alexandroupoli. During the nearly ten-day duration of the fire, approximately 80,000 ha burned, while the strong prevailing easterly winds transported smoke particles and biomass burning gases over Northern Greece and the Mediterranean Sea, reaching the coasts of Italy and Tunisia. Using both spaceborne observations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), formaldehyde (HCHO) and carbon monoxide (CO), as well as ground-based instrumentation in the city of Thessaloniki, the extend of the degradation of air quality has been quantified. The spatially resolved Sentinel-5P TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (S5P/TROPOMI) observations showed how the fire plumes spread throughout Northern Greece, degrading massively the air quality near the fire event as well as over Thessaloniki, some 300 km to the west. NO2 levels were enhanced up to 82 % over the fire location whereas in the metropolis of Thessaloniki by 36 %, testifying to the extent of the fire, the dispersion of the plume and the emission strength. During the main fire days HCHO levels were shown to be enhanced by 54 % in the greater area of Alexandroupoli and by 114 % in the vicinity of Thessaloniki, in line with other works. The longer-lived CO was found similarly enhanced in both locations, ∼26 %, with a longer lasting effect to regional air quality. Ground-based remote sensing resulted in similar findings with MAX-DOAS spectrophotometer observations of nitrogen dioxide capturing the build-up of the transported NO2 load over Thessaloniki with morning levels reaching 30 Pmolec/cm2, testifying to the magnitude of the transported NO2 loads well beyond the stable variability of the typical August mean NO2 levels of 10 Pmolec/cm2. The MAX-DOAS also measured increased formaldehyde levels throughout the days of the fire event, between 25 and 35 Pmolec/cm2, unaffected by the photochemical processes destroying NO2, and well beyond the typical summertime levels of ∼12 Pmolec/cm2. FTIR spectroscopy observations, also routinely performed over Thessaloniki, revealed that the long-lived carbon monoxide levels exceeded the expected background loads by more than 100.00 ± 10.61 ppb on the second major fire day. The predicted frequency increase of such major wildfire events places an imperative need for changes in the typical urban air quality monitoring practices currently in place, to account for unexpected degradation of the breathable air, as well as changes on how mitigation measures are presently applied by regional and central government."

 The Qilian Mountains (QM) in northwest China is a key source of orographic cloud formation, significantly influencing regional weather, climate, and hydrological balance. However, due to the sparse distribution of ground-based observational stations, the characteristics of orographic clouds and their associated precipitation remain insufficiently understood. Utilizing FengYun-4A black body temperature (TBB) data from 2018 to 2021 in boral summer, this study investigated the spatial and diurnal characteristics of orographic clouds and associated mechanisms over the QM. Results indicate that orographic clouds primarily form over the mountainous terrain, with deep convective clouds concentrated in the central and eastern QM. A distinct diurnal cycle is observed, with peak cloud activity occurring in the afternoon to early evening (15:00–19:00 local solar time), minimal activity late at night, and the weakest development in the morning. These variations are more pronounced in the central and eastern QM, where cloud formation persists for longer durations, compared to the western region. Three dominant diurnal cloud cycles are identified in the southeast, northeast, and eastern fringes of the western, central, and eastern QM, respectively, along with smaller-scale cycles along mountain ridges. Orographic cloud formation is driven by the convergence of low-level westerlies and the Asian monsoon, with moisture contributions from the westerlies, the Tibetan Plateau, and the monsoon system. Additionally, interactions between solar heating and complex terrain shape the spatial and diurnal distribution of these clouds. These findings enhance our understanding of regional water cycles and provide valuable insights for weather and climate research."
