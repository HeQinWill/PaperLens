Exhaled breath analysis, as a real–time and sensitive human biomonitoring technique, is causing significant concerns. This study aims to analyze and assess volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in human exhaled breath under ambient ozone (O3) exposure. A comprehensive correlation analysis involving 288 VOCs are identified in the exhaled breath of healthy adults (n = 1130), uncovering 12 VOCs including methanol, propyne, and 1–butene etc. that show strong exposed correlations with ambient O3 levels. Nonlinear modeling indicated the dose–response commencing at O3 concentrations as low as 58 μg/m3. Moreover, the presence of PM2.5 significantly exacerbates the effect of O3 on the filtered 12 VOCs. The most pronounced interplay is observed at 140 μg/m3 for O3 and 150 μg/m3 for PM2.5. Finally, an in-vivo study using rats validates the result, with all of the 12 exhaled breath biomarkers exhibit obvious differences (O3 exposure group vs control group). This work demonstrates direct evidence that ambient O3 pollution impacts on human exhaled VOCs, and also offers valuable insights for establishing O3 exposure thresholds."

In 2021, a case-control study was conducted in China, involving 103 participants with hyperlipidemia and 419 healthy controls, to investigate the effects of PPCP exposure on hyperlipidemia risk and the mediating roles of thyroid hormones. Among the individual PPCP, 4-hydroxybenzophenone showed the strongest association with hyperlipidemia risk (OR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.01, 2.28), followed by triclosan (OR: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.89). Mixture exposure levels of PPCP above the 50th percentile were associated with an elevated risk of hyperlipidemia, with 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone (BP-1) contributing most to the risk, followed by ethyl-protocatechuate. Significant mediating effects of free-triiodothyronine were observed in the relationships between triclosan, BP-1, and ΣPPCP exposure, and hyperlipidemia, with the mediated proportions of 12.19, 12.86, and 11.66%, respectively. These findings indicated that thyroid hormones played an important mediating role in the association and deserve more attention. Network toxicology models suggested that inhibiting lipolysis, promoting oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses may be potential biological mechanisms of PPCP-induced hyperlipidemia. For the first time, we identified the mediating effect of thyroid hormones on the association between PPCP exposure and hyperlipidemia risk, providing valuable insights into the mechanism for further toxicology studies."

As soluble microbial products (SMP) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) constitute important sources of DON in the water environment, understanding how their distinct compositional profiles influence DBP formation is critical for water safety assessment. This study systematically explored the chlorination reaction network of SMP and EPS, elucidating the structure and toxicological profiles of generated N-DBPs. The results showed that SMP, characterized by elevated aromaticity and humification, preferentially formed aromatic chlorinated DBPs (Cl-DBPs) through electrophilic aromatic substitution pathways. In contrast, EPS contained more labile protein with less ordered secondary structure, promoting N-DBP generation. Molecular network analysis showed that SMP primarily formed aromatic Cl-DBPs via lignin/tannin chlorination, whereas EPS generated more N-DBPs from proteins and lipids. Structural characterization via ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography–high resolution mass spectrometry proposed two predominant N-DBP classes: heterocyclic aromatic amines (high mammalian oral toxicity and developmental effects) and long-chain aliphatic amines (pronounced aquatic toxicity but minimal mammalian effects). This study provides critical insights into differential DBP formation pathways in chlorinated DON-rich water and highlights the necessity of multiend point toxicity assessment for water quality evaluation."

Abass;Jian-Qiang Su;Li Cui,Integrative Phenotypic and Genotypic Surveillance and Risk Assessment of Foodborne Antimicrobial Resistance in Meat–Environment Continuum,"Foodborne antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant One Health challenge. However, the risk and transmission of AMR within the meat–environment continuum remain poorly understood. Here, we conducted an integrative AMR surveillance of meats and associated environments from three markets using culture-independent single-cell Raman spectroscopy for phenotypic profiling and metagenomics for genotypic analysis. We found that environments consistently harbored a higher abundance of metabolically active antibiotic-resistant bacteria than meats. By incorporation of phenotypic AMR (abundance and activity of antibiotic-resistant bacteria), genotypic AMR (percentage of high-risk antibiotic resistance genes), and transmission potential, a new risk assessment framework was established. The integrated assessment revealed that environments were critical AMR reservoirs with risk levels higher than or comparable to those in meats, underscoring the necessity of integrating multiple factors for accurate risk assessment. Moreover, source tracking analysis suggested reciprocal cross-contamination between the samples, which was further confirmed by 25 shared metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) hosting high-risk ARGs among samples. By bridging phenomic and genomic insights, this work advances precision AMR surveillance and provides a more accurate risk assessment framework, offering critical guidance for mitigating AMR in the environment and the food chain."

A total of 28 PFASs were detected, including four ultrashort-chain and six emerging compounds. Industrial WWTP (I2) exhibited substantially elevated total PFAS levels (1596 μg/L) in wastewater compared to those of municipal/domestic WWTP. Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) is the dominant PFAS, with the highest concentration at 806 μg/L, contributing 22.3–92.8% for ∑PFAS. Hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid is the dominant emerging PFAS with a concentration up to 379 μg/L, while sodium p-perfluorous nonenoxybenzenesulfonate is the more frequently detected emerging PFAS. PFAS concentrations increase in most WWTPs after treatment but decrease in some WWTPs, especially M5 adding membrane bioreactor to the conventional treatment process. The 5.15–1265% increase in PFAA molar concentrations after the TOP assay reveals substantial precursors in wastewater. TFA accounts for over 90% of the total increase in PFAAs in some WWTPs. However, more than 99% of TFA increments cannot be explained from the known precursors. The annual discharge of TFA contributes 50% for the total PFAS emission flux (8993 kg/a), which should be a concern."

H. M. Oesterholt;Frederik Hammes;Paul W. J. J. van der Wielen,Monitoring Legionella in Drinking Water: Should We Focus on L. pneumophila or All Species to Effectively Protect Public Health?,"Legionella pneumophila is responsible for the majority of reported Legionnaires’ disease cases worldwide. However, environmental monitoring of building plumbing systems often targets a broad range of Legionella species, raising the question of whether monitoring should focus exclusively on L. pneumophila or include all Legionella species. This review examines the policy and public health implications of both strategies by assessing case attribution data for Legionnaires’ disease, the environmental prevalence of Legionella species, and the validity of using non-pneumophila counts as indicators for L. pneumophila. Although over 30 species can cause illness, L. pneumophila dominates culture-confirmed cases despite the frequent detection of L. non-pneumophila species in building plumbing and other known sources. Ecological differences between species, including growth temperatures and disinfection resistance, arguably limit the suitability of L. non-pneumophila species as reliable indicators for L. pneumophila. As a result, using all Legionella species counts to inform risk management may lead to excessive interventions without proportional public health benefits. We conclude that routine monitoring should prioritize L. pneumophila to ensure targeted, cost-effective, and health-relevant risk management. Broader monitoring may be warranted in high-risk settings or where local epidemiological data justify a more inclusive approach. These findings support risk-based regulatory frameworks that align monitoring targets with public health outcomes."

To address this, a size-probability distribution method is proposed that integrates empirical size distribution characteristics with volume-density models. The optimal configuration was identified by combining a conditional fragmentation distribution (CFD)-based size model with suitable volume approximations and evaluating it against measured mass from balance and mass spectrometry data. This method outperformed coefficient-based conversion approaches and achieved comparable accuracy with the results of direct volume-density calculations. When applied to empirical MP data from the Yangtze River, the method estimated annual mass fluxes ranging from 1950.00 to 12,655.58 tons, with a mean of 6895.90 ± 3763.24 tons. Overall, the proposed method provides a reliable and efficient means of estimating MP mass from particle counts data, yielding accurate, comparable mass estimates across different size classes."

However, current studies remain fragmented due to limited analysis of compounds, impeding mechanistic insights. Here, we present a novel framework that integrates high-throughput analysis and large language model-based text mining to identify organic compounds while leveraging existing massive data, thereby enabling a comprehensive understanding of pregnancy complication mechanisms and establishing an exposure atlas. Using this approach, we identified five compounds in human milk for the first time, including carbazole and 4,4′-diphenoxybenzophenone, and 35 additional compounds not previously linked to pregnancy complications. We further  employed text mining to comprehensively uncover disease-specific chemical signatures based on global data: GH with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and derivatives (e.g., 2-methylnaphthalene and acenaphthene), anemia with nitrogen-containing compounds (e.g., 4-methoxyformanilide), and GDM with long-chain carboxylic acids (e.g., 2,4,7,9-tetramethyldec-5-yne-4,7-diol). Further analysis revealed pathogenic mechanisms: PAHs and derivatives promoted oxidative stress in GH, nitrogen-containing compounds damaged red blood cells in anemia, and long-chain carboxylic acids interfered with mitochondrial function in GDM. These findings construct an atlas of organic compounds associated with pregnancy complications and offer new leads for understanding their environmental origins."

We use CrIS satellite observations and GEOS-Chem simulations to identify a persistent hotspot of free tropospheric PAN over the Sichuan Basin (SCB) in China during winter. The basin topography promotes the initial vertical lifting, while the subsequent temperature inversion layer in the free troposphere (FT) traps the lifted NOx and NMVOCs, thereby facilitating PAN formation. Budget analysis for a 3-D box representing the SCB FT (825–215 hPa) shows that photochemical production accounts for 73% of PAN formation, while vertical transport from below contributes 27%. Dominant photochemical PAN formation stems from stagnant air masses enabling sufficient oxidation of precursors and low winter temperatures prolonging PAN lifetime. Horizontal transport dominates PAN removal (50%), suggesting the SCB as a winter source of PAN and NOx to downwind regions. This study highlights that meteorology and terrain drive severe winter PAN pollution in the SCB."

Here, the authors report pyridine-substituted merocyanines as photochromic compounds, with a photoinitiated C-N bond formation. 
 The reversible interconversion between spiropyran and merocyanine constitutes one of the most intensively investigated photochromic systems, enabling diverse applications in stimuli-responsive materials and optical imaging. Here, we report pyridine-substituted merocyanines (PMCs) as a class of photochromic molecules. Upon visible light irradiation, these compounds undergo an uncommon photoinduced C-N bond formation to yield spiroindolizine (SIZ) structures, accompanied by the color fading. The SIZs can thermally revert to the colored PMC form. This photochromism is marked by rapid response, high photo-switching ratio, robust water compatibility, and fatigue resistance. Furthermore, we have synthesized quinoline-substituted merocyanines and found that they can be bidirectionally switched by 660 nm and 500 nm light to form SIZ and PMC structures. Finally, we showed the photochromism of these molecules in solid matrices and demonstrated a light-controlled sequential switching function, highlighting their potential for advanced photonic applications.

This study provides quantitative data to date on how nanoplastics distribute and eliminate from the body using carbon-14-radiolabelled particles in rats. 
 Nanoplastics (NPs) pose health concerns worldwide. However, robust quantitative data on their absorption, distribution, and excretion in mammals remain scarce. Here, we provide a comprehensive assessment of polystyrene (PS) NP biodistribution and elimination in rats using 14C-radiolabeling, the most accurate and quantitative method available. Pregnant rats were exposed to 14C-labeled 20 nm or 100 nm PS NPs (PS20 or PS100) via oral gavage, intratracheal aerosolization, or intravenous injection, and tissue distribution and excretion were determined by radioactivity measurements. We found that PS NPs were exclusively excreted through faeces, irrespective of the exposure routes, without urinary elimination. Both PS20 and PS100 crossed multiple biological barriers, yet only PS20 reached the brain. Maternal transfer of PS20 occurred through both placenta and milk, while PS100 transferred solely via milk. A physiologically based toxicokinetic model further simulated accumulation kinetics across tissues. This study establishes the most comprehensive and reliable quantitative profile of PS NP biodistribution in mammals to date, revealing distinct size-dependent translocation patterns that provide a robust foundation for evaluating their health impacts. Previous studies on biodistribution of microplastics showed discrepancies.

This lipid regulator remodels chromatin by boosting acetyl-CoA, silencing contractile genes while activating aging pathways. Targeting SREBP1 blocks senescence, revealing a therapeutic strategy for spaceflight-associated vascular remodeling. 
 Real or simulated microgravity induces a senescence-like modification of carotid artery in both human and animal observations, with the mechanisms not fully elucidated. Here, we aim to elucidate the role of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1, encoded by Srebf1) mediated lipogenesis in the process. Pharmacological activation of SREBP1 directly triggers senescence-like transformation in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), while silencing Srebf1 exerts an opposite effect. Mechanistically, SREBP1-mediated lipogenesis upregulates acetyl-CoA pool to increase histone acetylation, modifying the chromatin accessibility which limiting recruitment of SRF/myocardin complexes to CArG boxes of contractile genes and opening the chromatin accessibility of aging genes. Srebf1 knockdown and local delivery of lentivirus or AAV-mediated VSMC specific expressing sh-Srebf1 significantly attenuates the senescence-like transformation of VSMC both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized feature of SREBP1-mediated lipogenesis in vascular biology and SM-induced carotid artery remodeling.

 Atmospheric mercury depletion events (AMDEs) are a unique phenomenon in polar mercury cycling, involving intense atmospheric mercury oxidation and deposition that amplify marine mercury sinks. The Southern Ocean, a critical hotspot for environmental mercury exposure, exhibits AMDEs whose characteristics and distribution patterns remain unclear. This study presents the observational dataset of atmospheric gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) across the circum-Antarctic Southern Ocean. We observed pronounced summertime AMDEs that drove high spatial heterogeneity in circumpolar GEM distribution. By combining Generalized Additive Models (GAM) simulations with multi-platform observational evidence, we demonstrate that the Antarctic continental outflow largely shapes the circumpolar distribution of summertime AMDEs, concentrating these events within the convergence zones of katabatic winds. This work highlights the critical role of land-sea coupling effects in Antarctic atmospheric chemistry, and underscores the need to systematically assess the implications of these processes for mercury bioavailability across Southern Ocean ecosystems.

 The use of nucleic acid-based nanostructures as synthetic biological tools to interface with and regulate cell processes remains challenging. A major obstacle lies in nuclear delivery and retention within live eukaryotic cells. Here, we present a platform of single-stranded RNAs that can co-transcriptionally fold into defined nanostructures and assemble into rings, ribbons, and nanonet-like architectures. We validate the formation of these structures in vitro using atomic force microscopy. Then, we demonstrate the functional integration of fluorescent aptamers and RNA sensing capability within the single chain by co-folding with these structures. Notably, we show that the RNA nanonets can be co-transcriptionally produced and assembled directly inside the nucleus of live human cells. We use confocal live-cell imaging and transmission electron microscopy to reveal well-defined nanostructure patterns retained in the nucleus. Together, these results establish a genetically encoded, self-assembling RNA nanostructure system with programmable geometry and localization, providing a foundation for the development of RNA-based nanodevices to examine biological properties in live cells and tissues.

 The Asian-Australian monsoon system (A-AuMS) is the most typical cross-equatorial monsoon system and thus inter-hemispheric comparison is essential to explore its dynamics. Although the evolution of Holocene Asian summer monsoon has been extensively studied, changes in Australian summer monsoon (AuSM) is less investigated due to the lack of identified high-resolution paleoclimate records. Here we obtain a 13.5 kyr AuSM record from lacustrine sediments in northeastern Australia. It suggests that the weakening of the AuSM during the early to middle Holocene was regulated by Northern Hemisphere high-latitude ice volume, while the strengthening of the AuSM during the middle to late Holocene was mainly controlled by increased Southern Hemisphere summer insolation. The combination of Asian and Australian monsoon records show that the coupling evolution of A-AuMS was dominated by the temperature gradient between two hemispheres, which involve the changes of the AMOC, Northern Hemisphere ice volumes and solar insolation in both hemispheres.

 This study aims to investigate the roles of gut microbiota and plasma metabolites in salt sensitivity (SS) of blood pressure (SSBP) and hypertension. A 23-day, multicenter, dietary salt intervention trial (the MetaSalt study) recruited 528 participants who underwent a baseline observation, low-salt, and high-salt interventions. SSBP was assessed and used as the primary outcome, and fecal shotgun metagenome and plasma targeted metabolome were measured. We found that high salt significantly altered 85 gut-microbial species (p < 9.42 × 10−5) and 70 metabolites (p < 2.26 × 10−4). Among them, the changes in 22 species and 8 metabolites were associated with SSBP (p < 0.05), and a gut microbiota-acylcarnitine network implicated in SSBP was identified, with a gut microbiota-derived metabolite, isovalerylcarnitine, as the core metabolite. Isovalerylcarnitine was also inversely associated with SSBP in the GenSalt study (p = 0.0102). Importantly, increased isovalerylcarnitine attenuated SS hypertension and improved endothelial function in rats, and was associated with reduced risk (ranging from 13% to 19%) of BP progression and incident hypertension in a prospective cohort (n = 3907, median follow-up = 5.5 years).

 Efficient dynamic vision requires capturing instantaneous changes and temporal context, yet existing image and event sensors rely on power-hungry digital processing. Here, we introduce an in-sensor dual-response architecture that concurrently generates analog event spikes and persistent memory tails. A prototype sensor integrates phosphor pairs with silicon photodiodes and transimpedance amplifiers to achieve microsecond- and millisecond-scale dual kinetics. Measurements during light-emitting diode replay reconstruct event frames that match software frame differences, while the slow channel behaves as a linear reservoir of motion history. A single memory frame fed to a convolutional neural network enables accurate classification of human actions (93.1%) and vehicle trajectories (98.0%), as well as speed estimation with errors of 2.15 km/h. Integration with a compressive optical neural network front end mapping 4900 inputs to 16 per frame yields 93.3% action classification accuracy. By eliminating analog-to-digital conversion and digital accumulation, this approach enables ultralow-latency, ultralow-power neuromorphic vision.

 Variations in the winter India-Burma trough (IBT) are associated with local cyclonic anomalies over the Bay of Bengal and modulated by mid-latitude teleconnections. However, spring IBT variability remains poorly understand, despite trough-base precipitation being substantially greater than in winter. Here, we identify a reversal in the spring IBT-Tibetan Plateau snow cover (TPS) relationship around the year 2000. This shift corresponds to eastward displacement of the trough-base before 2000, followed by a retreat toward the Bay of Bengal. Snow-perturbation experiments and moist potential vorticity diagnostics show that during 1979–1999, high TPS enhances atmospheric disturbances ahead of the trough and weakens them near its base. This process hence triggers an eastward displacement of the IBT. During 2000–2020, high TPS exerts largely opposite effects. Furthermore, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) modulates this IBT-TPS linkage reversal. In the coming decades, a projected shift to a positive PDO phase is expected to promote IBT eastward displacement, enhancing spring precipitation in East Asia while increasing drought risk over the Indochina Peninsula. Our results hence provide a basis for improving seasonal projections and assessing climate risks across monsoon Asia."

 Biodiversity Hotspots (Hotspots), harboring exceptionally rich small-ranged species, are critical for mitigating biodiversity loss. As priorities for terrestrial conservation, Hotspots increasingly face threats from agriculture, the largest anthropogenic disturbance impacting biodiversity. Yet, the spatial dynamics of agricultural expansion and its impacts on biodiversity, especially small-ranged vertebrates, remain poorly understood. Using site-level observations and satellite imagery, we found that agricultural pressures reduce species richness by 25.8%, total abundance by 12.4%, and rarefied species richness by 8.7% relative to primary vegetation within Hotspots. However, cropland area within Hotspots expanded 12% from 2000–2019, exceeding the global average of 9%. Fine-scale analysis identified 3,483 risk spots (cropland expansion and high small-ranged vertebrate richness, ~1741 Mha); ~1031 Mha of these areas fall outside Protected Areas, particularly in the Atlantic Forest, Indo-Burma, Western Ghats, Sri Lanka, and Sundaland. These results underscore the urgent need for targeted conservation actions to prevent biodiversity loss from agricultural expansion.

 Extreme aerosol pollution events impact climate, air quality, and human health, yet their global synchronization patterns and driving mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we construct event synchronization networks to examine both near-field transmission and teleconnection of extreme aerosol pollution events. We find a marked increase in asymmetry within near-field event synchronization networks over recent decades, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, driven by intensified source-sink relationships in high-emission regions. Teleconnection patterns are shaped by Rossby wave activity, making high-aerosol regions increasingly sensitive to atmospheric variability and more susceptible to synchronized extreme events. We find a shift in high teleconnection activity from North America and Europe to Central and East Asia. While major volcanic eruptions can temporarily boost global aerosol synchronization, long-term trends are dominated by anthropogenic forcing. These findings reveal clear anthropogenic fingerprints of extreme aerosol pollution events at a planetary scale, linking regions of intense industrial activity to distant pollution impacts.

 The Mw 7.0 Dingri earthquake, the largest documented normal-faulting event in southern Tibet, struck within the NS-trending Dinggye-Xainza Rift system. Here we combine field observations, high resolution optical and synthetic aperture radar imagery and seismic waveforms to determine the three-dimensional coseismic deformation field, coseismic rupture processes and early postseismic deformation mechanisms of the event. We find that the rupture propagated unilaterally northward from the earthquake hypocenter, concurrently activating two graben-bounding faults. The main rupture was concentrated on the Dengmo Co fault causing a maximum subsidence of 3 m and a 25-km-long rupture trace at the surface. The first four-months postseismic deformation is dominated by shallow afterslip, which exhibits spatial overlap with the coseismic slip zone. Our observations provide important insights into the rupture kinematics and strain partitioning within the Dinggye-Xainza Rift, offering a valuable framework for understanding continental extensional tectonics and seismic cycle processes in similar southern Tibet grabens.

 Coastal river deltas are highly dynamic regions with hydrological processes that vary on hourly, daily, and seasonal timescales. Soil formation in deltas relies on the balance between mineral sediment deposition, erosion, and organic matter production, which are intricately controlled by vegetation and hydrodynamic conditions. The spatial complexity and rapid variations in flow, particularly due to tides, present a major challenge to spaceborne remote sensing achieving the required spatial resolution and temporal sampling. Here, we present an airborne remote sensing and in situ framework that measures parameters that are critical to calibrate and validate hydrodynamic, sediment transport, morphodynamic, and ecogeomorphic models. We discuss the measurements and models within the context of the NASA Earth Venture-Suborbital Delta-X mission, which implemented the framework in two deltaic regions of the Mississippi River Delta with contrasting hydrological regimes, namely the Atchafalaya (i.e., active, river-dominated) and Terrebonne (inactive, river-abandoned) basins that are undergoing land gain and land loss, respectively. The Delta-X framework uses two airborne radar instruments to monitor hydrodynamic processes, measuring water surface level and slope within channels, and tide-induced water level change within wetlands. In addition, an airborne imaging spectrometer provides estimates of suspended sediment concentrations in open water as well as vegetation type and aboveground biomass. We also discuss how the data are used to calibrate and validate the models that estimate sediment deposition and organic soil production, which build land to offset subsidence and sea level rise."
