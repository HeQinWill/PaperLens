This article challenges conventional framings of scientific objectivity, arguing that justice, accountability, and epistemic pluralism are not threats to scientific credibility but conditions of its ethical and societal relevance. Drawing on interdisciplinary insights, it advances a vision of climate science that is reflexive, engaged, and responsive to the unequal burdens of climate disruption. Amid compounding climate injustices, detachment is not a position of neutrality but a failure to engage with the responsibilities of knowledge production."

Seasonal patterns were found where wet seasons were dominated by biogenic compounds from natural sources while dry seasons showed increased fire-related pollutants. These findings reveal how emissions, fires and long-range transport affect atmospheric chemistry, with implications for climate models. 
 The Amazon rainforest plays a crucial role in the global climate system, hydrological cycle, and earth's energy balance. As one of the planet's least industrialized regions, it allows investigation of organic aerosol formation and constituents under almost pristine conditions. Nevertheless, human activities are known to affect this ecosystem – especially during the dry seasons. In this study, ambient aerosol samples collected at the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO) during two dry and two wet seasons were characterized by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS). Comprehensive non-targeted data evaluation was applied to identify thousands of molecular formulae. Most were found to be associated with oxidation products of isoprene and monoterpenes, highlighting the predominance of biogenic secondary organic aerosols (SOA) at ATTO. The chemical composition exhibited distinct seasonal patterns with more processed organic compounds during the dry season, which can be explained by an increase of later-generation oxidation products due to reduced wet deposition and enhanced long-range transport. Mono- and polycyclic heteroaromatic components from biomass burning (BB) sources were enhanced during the dry seasons and the second wet season. The wet seasons were generally characterized by less oxidized compounds, associated with freshly formed SOA particles. Height-resolved measurements showed biogenic emissions with higher concentrations of early terpene oxidation products at lower altitudes. Overall, our results provide new insights into the molecular characteristics and seasonality of organic particulate matter at ATTO, helping to constrain the sources and interactions of aerosols, clouds, and precipitation in the Amazon rainforest."

We present a large dataset of high-quality measurements of sulfur dioxide gas and fine aerosol particulate matter collected during ongoing series of eruptions in Iceland. We revealed rapid, localized changes in pollutant concentrations at ground level, with implications for assessing population exposure during volcanic eruptions. 
 The 2021 Fagradalsfjall eruption marked the first in a series of ongoing eruptions in a densely populated region of Iceland (>260 000 residents within 50 km distance). This eruption was monitored by an exceptionally dense regulatory air quality network, providing a unique opportunity to examine fine-scale dispersion patterns of volcanic air pollutants (SO2, PM1, PM2.5, PM10) in populated areas.Despite its relatively small size, the eruption led to statistically-significant increases in PM and SO2 concentrations at distances of at least 300 km. Peak daily-mean concentrations of PM1 (measured in the capital area, 25–35 km distance from the source) rose from 5–6 to 18–20 µg m−3, and the proportion of PM1 within PM10 increased by ∼50 %. In areas with low background pollution, average PM10 and PM2.5 levels increased by ∼50 % but in places with high background sources, the eruption's impact was not detectable. These findings suggest that ash-poor eruptions are a major source of PM1 in Iceland and potentially in other regions exposed to volcanic emissions.Air quality guidelines for PM1 and SO2 were exceeded more frequently during the eruption than under background conditions. This suggests the potential for an increase in adverse health effects. Moreover, pollutant concentrations exhibited strong fine-scale temporal (≤1 h) and spatial (<1 km) variability. This suggests disparities in population exposures to volcanic air pollution, even from relatively distal sources, and underscores the importance of a dense monitoring network and effective public communication."

These suggest that the eruption could have a non-negligible influence on regional surface climate, and we discuss the mechanisms via which such an influence could occur but also highlight that the forcing is relatively weak compared to natural climate variability which significantly hinders the detection of such impacts in the real world. 
 Injection of sulfur and water vapour by the Hunga volcanic eruption significantly altered chemical composition and radiative budget of the stratosphere. Yet, whether the eruption could also affect surface climate, especially via indirect pathways, remains poorly understood. Here we investigate these effects using large ensembles of simulations with the CESM2(WACCM6) Earth system model, incorporating interactive chemistry and aerosols in both coupled ocean and atmosphere-only configurations.We find some statistically significant extratropical regional climate responses to the eruption driven by circulation changes; these are partially linked to the modulation of El Niño–Southern Oscillation, and its associated teleconnections, and to perturbations of the stratospheric polar vortex in both hemispheres. The stratospheric anomalies affect surface climate through modulating the North Atlantic Oscillation in the Northern Hemisphere (up to three boreal winters following the eruption) and the Southern Annular Mode in the Southern Hemisphere in late 2023. The latter is partly related to a concurrent reduction in Antarctic ozone, as increased stratospheric aerosols and water vapor reach the polar vortex.Our study suggests that the eruption could have had a non-negligible influence on regional surface climate, and discusses the mechanisms via which such an influence could occur. However, the results also highlight that this forcing is relatively weak compared to interannual variability, and is subject to model uncertainties in the representation of key processes. More research is thus needed before definitive statements on the role of the eruption in contributing to surface climate and weather events in the following years are made."

This work directly observed the core-shell structure and water uptake behavior of individual submicron aerosol particles at an urban site and elucidated the potential impact on particle reactive uptake and heterogeneous reactions. 
 Determining the particle chemical morphology is crucial for unraveling reactive uptake in atmospheric multiphase and heterogeneous chemistry. However, it remains challenging due to the complexity and inhomogeneity of aerosol particles. Using a scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) coupled with near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy and an environmental cell, we imaged and quantified the chemical morphology and hygroscopic behavior of individual submicron urban aerosol particles. Results show that internally mixed particles composed of organic carbon and inorganic matter (OCIn) dominated the particle population (73.1±7.4 %). At 86 % relative humidity, 41.6 % of the particles took up water, with OCIn particles constituting 76.8 % of these hygroscopic particles. Most particles exhibited a core-shell structure under both dry and humid conditions, with an inorganic core and an organic shell. Our findings provide direct observational evidence of the core-shell structure and water uptake behavior of typical urban aerosols, which underscore the importance of incorporating the core-shell structure into models for predicting the reactive uptake coefficient of heterogeneous reactions."

Pandey;Adeyemi A. Adebiyi,Dust semi-direct effects: low-level cloud response to free-tropospheric dust-induced longwave radiation over the North Atlantic Ocean,"Mineral dust absorbs solar and terrestrial radiation, modifying the environment where clouds exist. When above low-level clouds, dust often increases cloud cover due to shortwave absorption. Using satellite data over the North Atlantic Ocean, we show that longwave absorption by dust reduces cloud-top cooling and weakens the increase in low-level cloud. Our results highlight the importance of accurately representing longwave effects of dust in model assessments of aerosol-climate interactions. 
 Aerosol semi-direct effect is the adjustment of the radiative budget due to the cloud response to radiation absorption. Although dust accounts for about a third of aerosols' shortwave absorption, our understanding of its semi-direct effect often relies on traditional shortwave-focused mechanisms previously established for biomass-burning aerosols, and implications of dust longwave absorption on clouds have yet to be explored. Here, we assess the low-level cloud cover (LLCC) response to changes in properties and characteristics of the free-tropospheric dust layer over the North Atlantic Ocean (May–August, 2007–2017). We find that, consistent with previous studies, LLCC typically responds positively (increases in clouds) to an overlying dust layer. However, this response weakens with increasing dust optical depth (DOD), dust geometric thickness (DGT), and dust-layer base height (DBH). Specifically, we find that the LLCC response weakens by 4.3 ± 1.04 % and 1.6 ± 0.65 %, respectively, for a one-standard-deviation increase in DOD and DGT, and a smaller response to DBH (0.19 ± 0.45 %). We also find that the weakened LLCC response is primarily due to enhanced dust-induced longwave-dominated cloud-top warming, which counteracts the mean cloud-top cooling by as much as 19 % (mean of 9 %). Sensitivity analysis further indicates that the variability in dust properties, influenced by dust size distribution and refractive index, dominates the changes in dust-induced cloud-top warming, rather than variabilities in cloud properties or thermodynamic profiles. Our result adds to the traditional understanding of LLCC enhancement through shortwave-driven atmospheric stability, often associated with aerosol semi-direct effects, and highlights the role of dust-induced cloud-top longwave warming in dust semi-direct effects."

Hasekamp,Uncertainty in aerosol effective radiative forcing from anthropogenic and natural aerosol parameters in ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3,"Aerosols (small airborne particles) impact Earth's climate, but their extent is unknown. By running climate model simulations and using machine learning to emulate millions of additional variants with different settings, we found that natural emissions like sea spray and sulfur are key sources of uncertainty in climate predictions. Our work shows that understanding these natural processes better can help improve climate models and make future climate projections more accurate. 
 Interactions between aerosols, clouds, and radiation remain a major source of uncertainty in effective radiative forcing (ERF), limiting the accuracy of climate projections. This study aims to quantify parametric uncertainties in aerosol–cloud and aerosol–radiation interactions using a perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE) of 221 simulations with the ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3 climate model, varying 23 aerosol-related parameters that control emissions, removal, chemistry, and microphysics.The resulting global mean aerosol ERF is −1.24 W m−2 (5–95 percentile: −1.56 to −0.89 W m−2). Uncertainty in ERF is dominated by sulfate-related processes, biomass burning, aerosol size, and natural emissions. For aerosol-cloud interactions, dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and biomass burning emissions are key drivers, whereas sulfate chemistry and dry deposition exert the strongest influence on aerosol-radiation interactions. Structural uncertainty is difficult to characterize, and this study focuses primarily on evaluating parametric uncertainty. The leading sources of ERF parametric uncertainty identified here are consistent with those found in other PPE studies, highlighting common sensitivities across climate models.Comparison with POLDER-3/PARASOL satellite retrievals reveals persistent model biases in aerosol optical depth (AOD), Ångström exponent (AE), and single-scattering albedo (SSA), many of which fall within the parametric uncertainty range. Sulfate-related processes account for over 40 % of AOD uncertainty, while AE and SSA are most sensitive to DMS, sea salt, and black carbon parameters. Correlation analysis between key parameters and observables indicates that several biases may be reduced by tuning through physically consistent parameter adjustments for bias reduction. Our results highlight the need for combined efforts in parameter optimization and structural model development to improve confidence in aerosol-forcing estimates and future climate projections."

Kahn;Hitoshi Matsui;Toshihiko Takemura;Meiyun Lin;Yuanyu Xie;Dongchul Kim;Maria Val Martin,The sensitivity of smoke aerosol dispersion to smoke injection height and source-strength: a multi-model AeroCom study,"Wildfire smoke can travel far from its source, affecting air quality far from the fire itself. This study looks at how two key factors – how much smoke is emitted & how high it rises – affect how smoke spreads. Using data from a major 2008 Siberian wildfire, four models were tested. Results show that models often inject smoke too low & remove it too quickly, missing high-altitude smoke seen by satellites. Better estimates of smoke height and removal are crucial to improve air quality forecasts. 
 The near-source and downwind impacts of smoke aerosols depend on both emitted mass and injection height. This study examines aerosol dispersion sensitivity to these factors using four global models from the AeroCom Phase III Biomass Burning Emission and Injection Height (BBEIH) experiment. Each model performed four simulations: BASE, using burned-area-based BB emissions GFED4.1s with default injection heights; BBIH, using monthly MISR plume injection heights; BBEM, using fire- radiative-power-based BB emission FEERv1.0; and NOBB, excluding BB emissions. The focus is the April 2008 Siberian wildfire event. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) varies across models. In BASE, all models show a steeper AOD decline from the source to downwind regions than satellite data, indicating inadequate long-range transport or excessive aerosol removal in all models. Moreover, near-source, most models overestimate aerosol extinction below 2 km, suggesting injection heights are too low. In BBIH, MISR plume injection heights slightly improve vertical aerosol distribution, but the magnitude is too small. In BBEM, AOD increases significantly near the source due to enhanced BB emissions; however, the downwind AOD remains largely underestimated in both BBIH and BBEM. Notably, CALIOP lidar reveals aerosol layers above 6 km from source to downwind regions – features absent in all model simulations, although a high bias in the gridded CALIOP data makes the evaluation inconclusive. These results suggest that monthly MISR plume injection heights and enhanced BB emissions alone are insufficient to resolve the model–observation discrepancies. Injecting smoke at higher altitudes in Siberia and reducing aerosol wet removal warrant further investigation."

Positive Matrix Factorization analyses were conducted on the corresponding 11-year dataset, which determined ten PM sources. Temporal evolution of these sources is investigated, highlighting a strong downward trend of anthropogenic sources over 11 years. 
 The identification of particulate matter (PM) sources and the quantification of their contribution to the urban environment is a necessary input for policymakers to reduce the air pollution impacts. The association between the PM sources and the oxidative potential (OP) is also a key indicator for evaluating the ability of PM sources to induce in-vivo oxidative stress and lead to adverse health effects, which becomes an emerging metric in the Directive on ambient air quality (22024/2881/EU). Most studies in Europe have focused on PM and OP sources in the short term, for only 1 or 2 years. However, the efficiency of reduction policies, trends, and epidemiological impacts cannot be properly evaluated with such short-term studies due to a lack of statistical robustness. Here, long-term PM10 filter sampling at the Grenoble (France) urban background supersite and detailed chemical analyses were used to investigate decadal trends of the main PM sources and related OP metrics. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analyses were conducted on the corresponding 11-year dataset (January 2013 to May 2023, n=1570), enlightening the contributions of 10 PM sources: mineral dust, sulfate-rich, primary traffic, biomass burning, primary biogenic, nitrate-rich, MSA-rich, aged sea salt, industrial and chloride-rich. The stability of the chemical profile of these sources was validated by comparison with the profiles retrieved from shorter-term (3 years) successive PMF analyses. A Seasonal-Trend using LOESS decomposition was then applied to evaluate the trends of these PM10 sources, which revealed a substantial decrease in PM10 (−0.73 µgm-3yr-1) as well as that of many of the PM10 sources. Specifically, negative trends for primary traffic and biomass burning sources are detected, with a reduction of 0.30 and 0.11 µgm-3yr-1, respectively. The OP PM10 source apportionment in 11 years confirmed the high redox activity of the anthropogenic sources, including biomass burning, industrial, and primary traffic. Eventually, downward trends were also observed for OPAA and OPDTT, mainly driven by the reduction of residential heating and transport emissions, respectively."

Statistically significant trends are emerging, including increasing infrared radiation due to a warming atmosphere, and decreasing solar radiation due to increasing liquid water content in clouds. These trends are influenced by large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns and by atmospheric rivers. 
 Arctic amplification manifests as a pervasive warming trend emerging over the past century in near-surface air temperature throughout the Arctic that is double the globally averaged temperature increase throughout most of the year. It results from complex processes involving oceanic, atmospheric and terrestrial components which require detailed study to discern roles of the fundamental processes involved to improve predictions of the Arctic environment. We report on signals that are beginning to emerge, on a timescale predicted by recent satellite remote sensing studies, from the unique 25 year record of detailed surface-based radiometer measurements obtained by the US Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Facility North Slope of Alaska (NSA) site at Utqiaġvik, Alaska. Statistically significant warming trends are found at the site in the boreal fall, while a decrease in net radiation occurs in late summer. This decrease is driven primarily by the decrease in shortwave radiation resulting from increasing cloud liquid water path as observed by the microwave radiometer. The magnitude of the liquid water path trends is slightly larger than the root mean square error (RMSE) due to natural variability, while the magnitude of the net radiation trends is smaller than the RMSE natural variability, emphasizing that these signals are only just emerging. Analysis of prevailing meteorological regimes linking NSA with the Arctic Ocean and subarctic latitudes, and atmospheric rivers, suggests that specific changing circulation patterns are the primary driver for these summertime trends."

We present an algorithm which uses observations of the Flexible Combined Imager (FCI) to estimate the total column of WV (TCWV) over sun-lit, clear-sky pixels. FCI is a satellite instrument, and every 10 min it takes an image which covers Europe, Africa, and the Atlantic with a resolution of 1 km. Such high-resolution WV fields will provide valuable information for weather forecasters and researchers. 
 A retrieval of total column water vapour (TCWV) from the new daytime, clear-sky near-infrared (NIR) measurements of the Flexible Combined Imager (FCI) onboard the geostationary satellite Meteosat Third Generation Imager (MTG-I, Meteosat-12) is presented. The retrieval algorithm is based on the differential absorption technique, relating TCWV amounts to the radiance ratio of a non-absorbing band at 0.865 µm and a nearby water vapour (WV) absorbing band at 0.914 µm. The sensitivity of the band ratio to WV amount increases towards the surface which means that the whole atmospheric column down to the boundary-layer moisture variability can be observed well.The retrieval framework is based on an optimal estimation (OE) method, providing pixel-based uncertainty estimates. It builds on well-established algorithms for other passive imagers with similar spectral band settings. Transferring knowledge gained in their development onto FCI required new approaches. The absence of additional, adjacent window bands to estimate the surface reflectance within FCI's absorbing channel is mitigated using a principal component regression (PCR) from the bands at 0.51, 0.64, 0.865, 1.61, and 2.25 µm.We utilize synergistic observations from Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) and Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) to generate “FCI-like” measurements. OLCI bands were complemented with SLSTR bands, enabling evaluation of the retrieval's robustness and global performance of the PCR. Furthermore, this enabled algorithm testing under realistic conditions using well-characterized data, at a time when a long-term, fully calibrated FCI Level 1c dataset was not available. We built a forward model for two FCI equivalent OLCI bands at 0.865 and 0.9 µm. A long-term validation of OLCI against a single atmospheric radiation measurement (ARM) reference site without the PCR resulted in a bias of 1.85 kg m−2, centred root-mean-square deviation (cRMSD) of 1.26 kg m−2, and a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.995.A first verification of the OLCI/SLSTR “FCI-like” TCWV against well-established ground-based TCWV products concludes with a wet bias between 0.33–2.84 kg m−2, a cRMSD between 1.46–2.21 kg m−2, and r between 0.98–0.99. In this set of comparisons, only land pixels were considered. Furthermore, a dataset of FCI Level 1c observations with a preliminary calibration was processed. The TCWV processed for these FCI measurements aligns well with reanalysis TCWV and collocated OLCI/SLSTR TCWV but shows a dry bias. A more rigorous validation and assessment will be done once a longer record of FCI data is available.TCWV observations derived from geostationary satellite measurements enhance monitoring of WV distributions and associated meteorological phenomena from synoptic scales down to local scales. Such observations are of special interest for the advancement of nowcasting techniques and numerical weather prediction (NWP) accuracy as well as process-studies."

The study spans over 15 years and provides detailed information on European CH4 emission trends and seasonality, using in-situ data, including Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) network. Our results highlight the importance of improving details in the inversion setup, such as the treatment of lateral boundary conditions to narrow the uncertainty ranges further. 
 Atmospheric inversions are widely used to evaluate and improve inventories of methane (CH4) emissions across scales from global to local, combining observations with atmospheric transport models. This study uses the dense network of in situ stations of the Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) to explore how well in situ data can constrain European CH4 emissions. Following the concept of inter-comparison studies of the atmospheric tracer transport model inter-comparison Project (TransCom), a CH4 inverse inter-comparison modeling study has been performed, focusing on Europe for the period 2006–2018. The aim is to investigate the capability of inverse models to deliver consistent flux estimates at the national scale and evaluate trends in emission inventories, using a detailed dataset of CH4 emissions described and presented here for first time.Study participants were asked to perform inverse modelling computations using a common database of a priori CH4 emissions and in-situ observations as specified in a protocol. The participants submitted their best estimates of CH4 emissions for the 27 European Union (EU-27) member states, the United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Norway. Results were collected from 9 different inverse modelling systems, using 7 different global and regional transport models. The range of outcomes allows us to assess posterior emission uncertainty, accounting for transport model uncertainty and inversion design decisions, including a priori emission and model-data mismatch uncertainty.This paper presents inversion results covering 15 years, that are used to investigate the seasonality and trends of CH4 emissions. The different inversion systems show a range of a posteriori emission adjustments, pointing to factors that should receive further attention in the design of inversions such as optimising background mole fractions. Most inverse models increase the seasonal cycle amplitude, by up to 400 Gg month−1, with the largest adjustments to the a priori emissions in Western and Eastern Europe. This might be due to underestimation of emissions from wetlands during summer or the importance of seasonality in other microbial sources, such as landfills and waste water treatment plants. In Northern Europe, absolute flux adjustments are comparatively small, which could imply that the emission magnitude is relatively well captured by the a priori, though the lower station density could contribute also.Across Europe, the inverse models yield a similar decreasing trend in CH4 emissions compared to the a priori emissions (−12.3 % instead of −9.1 %) from 2006 to 2018. While both the a priori and the a posteriori trend for the EU-27 are statistically significant from zero, their difference is not. On a subregional scale, the differences between a posteriori and a priori trends are more statistically significant over regions with more in-situ measurement sites, such as over Western and Southern Europe.Uncertainties in the a priori anthropogenic emissions, such as in the agriculture sector (cows, manure), or waste sector (microbial CH4 emissions), but also in the a priori natural emissions, e.g. wetlands, might be responsible for the discrepancies between the a priori and a posteriori emission shift in the trends in Western,  Eastern and Southern Europe.Our results highlight the importance of improving the inversion setup, such as the treatment of lateral boundary conditions and the model representation of measurement sites, to narrow the uncertainty ranges further.

Goldberg;Beatriz Recinos;Andrew Orr;Dhananjay Regmi,"Towards Bedmap Himalayas: a new airborne glacier thickness survey in Khumbu Himal, Nepal","We present a new and uniquely extensive dataset of glacier thickness from the Khumbu Himal around Mount Everest that stretches for 119 km, doubling the extent of thickness measurements in High Mountain Asia. Such measurements are key inputs for models that estimate how much ice is stored on the whole mountain range scale and for models that predict how this ice reserve will change in future, and what impact this will have on water supply for the large populations living downstream. 
 Mountain glaciers provide an important service in sustaining river flows for large populations downstream of High Mountain Asia (HMA) but these glaciers are retreating and the future of this water resource is highly uncertain. Glacier thickness measurements are vital for accurate mapping of the remaining ice reserve and for predicting where and how fast it will decline under climate change, but such measurements are severely lacking in this region due to the difficulties of surveying in remote, high-altitude settings. We report on a uniquely extensive new thickness dataset for eleven glaciers in the Khumbu Himal around Mount Everest that we collected in late 2019 using a novel, low-frequency helicopter-borne radar. To aid in interpreting the survey radargrams we developed a terrain clutter model, and we succeeded in mapping ice thickness with a precision of around ±7 % and horizontal spacing of around 40 m, for thicknesses of up to 445 m and spanning a total of 119 line-km, approximately doubling the length of previous thickness surveys in HMA. To demonstrate the utility of our new measurements, we compare them to existing modelled thickness products and find that the models struggle to reproduce the distribution of ice in these complex, steep, rapidly slowing, thinning and stagnating glaciers, with widespread systematic thin and thick biases equivalent to around half of the measured ice thickness or more. This new dataset (https://doi.org/10.5285/e39647f5-fb72-4d16-acbd-9784ed2167b8 (Pritchard al., 2025) permits for the first time a detailed analysis of model performance on Himalayan glaciers, a key step in improving model skill and hence the accuracy of modelled thickness distributions and future ice loss on the mountain-range scale."

The method showed high accuracy and rapid response potential regardless of weather and illumination conditions. By overcoming the limits of optical satellite imagery, it offers a powerful tool for timely landslide disaster response, benefiting disaster management and advancing methods for monitoring hazardous terrains. 
 Rapid response to multiple landslide events demands accurate, all-weather, day-and-night detection capabilities. Optical remote sensing has advanced landslide detection but remains limited under adverse weather and lighting conditions. Synthetic Aperture Radar, resilient to these constraints, remains underexplored for automated landslide detection due to challenges such as complex pre-processing and geometric distortions. This study integrates Deep Neural Networks with Sentinel-1 backscatter data for co-seismic landslide detection, utilizing a data-centric approach. We train and test the models using 11 earthquake-induced widespread landslide events, covering ≈ 73 000 landslides across diverse geologic and climatic settings. Inference on unseen events in Haiti (2021) and Sumatra (2022) demonstrates robust transferability, achieving F1-scores up to 82 %. Using explainable artificial intelligence, we highlight the discriminative capability of change detection bands over backscatter alone. Our findings emphasize the potential of SAR-based DNN models for worldwide, generalized, and rapid landslide detection, addressing critical gaps in current methods that solely use optical data. This research lays a foundation for broader applications in automated SAR-based earth surface change detection, particularly in complex, hilly and mountainous terrains."

Ross;Robert Hallberg,Assessing vertical coordinate system performance in the Regional Modular Ocean Model 6 configuration for Northwest Pacific,"We conducted sensitivity experiments to examine how different vertical coordinates influence the representation of water masses and tides using a high-resolution regional ocean model for the Northwest Pacific. We found that the choice of vertical coordinate  strongly affects the degree of artificial mixing, which in turn changes how well the model reproduces key ocean features. This highlights the importance of selecting a vertical coordinate when developing regional ocean models. 
 The Northwest Pacific (NWP) has a complex ocean circulation system and is among the regions most affected by climate change. To facilitate rapid responses to marine incidents and effectively address climate variability impacts, the Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology (KIOST) developed the Korea Operational Oceanographic System–Ocean Predictability Experiment for Marine Environment (KOOS-OPEM), a high-resolution regional ocean prediction system based on Modular Ocean Model version 5 (MOM5). In this study, the base model of KOOS-OPEM was upgraded to MOM6 to enhance its regional ocean modeling capabilities. A key advancement of MOM6 is its flexible vertical coordinate system enabled by a Lagrangian remapping system. Taking advantage of this feature, we evaluated the impact of vertical coordinate choices on model performance by comparing the HYBRID (z∗-isopycnal) and ZSTAR (z∗) configurations. Model outputs from the 2003–2012 period were assessed against multiple observational datasets and reanalysis products to determine their ability to reproduce key oceanographic features. The results indicated that HYBRID better preserved stratification and reduced spurious diapycnal mixing, significantly improving the representation of North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW). In contrast, ZSTAR exhibited excessive diapycnal mixing, resulting in a thicker isopycnal layer associated with NPIW and a salinity bias of approximately 0.2 psu. An idealized age tracer experiment further confirmed that ZSTAR facilitates excessive downward diffusion of younger surface waters, eroding the minimum salinity layer of the NPIW. In tidal simulations, HYBRID outperformed ZSTAR in reproducing M2 tidal amplitudes in the Yellow Sea, where stratification plays a key role. Conversely, ZSTAR underestimated these amplitudes due to its limitations in representing stratification. Despite its advantages, HYBRID underperformed in high-latitude regions, exhibiting larger temperature and salinity biases between 100 and 600 m depth, with temperature biases reaching approximately −1 °C. This discrepancy arose because HYBRID maintained fewer active layers in weakly stratified regions, reducing vertical resolution and leading to errors in water mass representation. To mitigate these issues and improve HYBRID's performance in high-latitude regions, adjustments to target density profiles are necessary. In addition, both configurations showed limitations in simulating winter SST, largely due to insufficient vertical resolution in the surface mixed layer. To address these issues, adopting a finer surface layer resolution (e.g., 1 m instead of 2 m) will further enhance the model's representation of mixed-layer processes."

In this study, we provide an overview of the main principles guiding climate simulation by SCMs, as well as a description of most high-profile SCMs. This work offers a clear reference to support the informed use of these important tools. 
 Simple Climate Models (SCMs) are a key tool in climate research, enabling the rapid exploration of climate responses beyond the reach of more complex models and aiding in the estimation of future climate uncertainty. Over the past two decades, the number and diversity of SCMs have expanded considerably, increasing their use but also complicating efforts to understand differences in model structure and their implications. The reduced-complexity model intercomparison project (RCMIP) has begun to address this challenge by comparing output from a wide range of SCMs. However, the need for a systematic analysis of model structure remains. Here, we complement RCMIP's work by systematically analysing the structure, components, and development histories of the 14 SCMs participating in RCMIP. We begin with a summary of the core principles underpinning SCM-based climate simulation, then review genealogy and design choices of each model. This synthesis provides a comprehensive reference for both developers and users, clarifying the diverse approaches within the SCM landscape and supporting informed use and further development of these models."

Simulations varied in sample size, mediator set size, correlation structure, proportion of true mediators, and mediation effect size (beta). We assessed each method’s ability to estimate the total indirect effect (TIE), component indirect effects (CIEs), sensitivity, and specificity. In scenarios with independent metabolites, HIMA and HDMA reliably estimated CIEs, while HDMA provided the most accurate estimate of the TIE. MITM generally underestimated the TIE, and HIMA showed improved TIE estimates with higher mediator effect sizes. In correlated settings, CIE estimation was not feasible due to the lack of identifiable causal contrasts, and all methods underestimated the TIE. Sensitivity declined in low beta, small sample size, and high-dimensional scenarios, though specificity remained high (>90%) across all methods. Findings suggest that HIMA offers the most accurate mediation results but may exclude meaningful features through dimensionality reduction. Therefore, applying parallel mediation approaches, such as MITM and HIMA, and focusing on the overlapping findings would be recommended. These results underscore the need for the development of robust, scalable mediation methods tailored to untargeted metabolomics data."

Oil carried by marine debris arriving at Palm Beach, Florida in 2020 matched oil from the 2019 Brazil mystery oil spill, having traveled ∼8500 km in ∼240 days.

The diffusion limitation of pore structures prevents the efficient deposition of relatively large organometallic precursors on medium/small-pore zeolites. A rich variety of etching strategies are proposed to facilitate deep deposition of reactive precursors. The Cu-ZSM-5(Na2CO3) catalyst showed a 2.3-fold enhancement in Cu loading compared with parent zeolite and more copper active sites at the same Cu-ALD cycles. The Cu-ZSM-5(Na2CO3) achieved the most excellent low-temperature deNOx performance and was accompanied by a wide temperature window, announcing the compatibility of medium-pore zeolite with the ALD technique. It was found that the diffusion of pore structures is the key to the coupling of ALD with zeolites when Si/Al is lower than 20, and the insufficient framework Al (FAL) is fatal for copper(II) hexafluoroacetylacetonate [Cu(hfac)2] deposition when Si/Al is higher than 20. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations verified that Cu(hfac)2 prefers to be deposited on FAL sites at the intersectional channels and the extra-framework Al is detrimental to copper deposition.

It unfolds through the interaction of people, institutions, and ecosystems, making it difficult to separate social and ecological processes. Systems approaches help organize this complexity, and participatory research extends these approaches by including the people who understand the system from perspectives not captured in expert models or existing data. This review examines how participation is practiced and reported in socio-environmental systems research. We analyzed 194 studies to understand who participates, when engagement occurs, and how it is facilitated. Most involved government and industry actors, relied on one primary method such as interviews or workshops, and concentrated participation in early stages of research. Few continued to engage participants through model testing, analysis, or application, and many offered limited detail about how participation was designed or documented. These gaps make it difficult to compare studies or build cumulative understanding of how participatory processes influence modeling outputs. To address this, we introduce the Purpose/Approach Matrix, a framework for connecting study goals with the design and reporting of stakeholder engagement. The matrix supports transparent, context-specific participatory research that aligns modeling practice with the changing realities of human and environmental systems."

We sampled SPGW, runoff, and rivers near Simpson Lagoon, Alaska, during spring ice breakup, summer open water, and fall freeze-up seasons. Through incubation experiments, we compared biodegradable DOC (BDOC) across sources and seasons and linked these results with DOM composition using Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). DOM composition was distinctly different between SPGW and rivers and shifted throughout the year. SPGW contained an order of magnitude more dissolved organic carbon (DOC) than rivers, with average concentrations increasing from breakup (22 ± 5 mg C L–1) to freeze-up (110 ± 42 mg C L–1). SPGW also contained three times or more BDOC than rivers, averaging 18 ± 1% during breakup and declining to 3.4 ± 0.7% during freeze-up. BDOC was positively correlated with condensed aromatic and polyphenolic DOM formula classes that are often associated with recalcitrant organic matter. Thus, SPGW DOM is highly aromatic yet biodegradable and is likely an important energy source to Arctic coastal waters in summer when river inputs are low."

Fractionating SOC into labile particulate organic carbon (POC) and stable mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC) is crucial for predicting its stability. Precipitation-induced variations in coarse (>2 mm) and fine (<2 mm) roots are key regulators of SOC stability, but their specific contributions remain unclear. Here, we conducted a 10-year field simulation of precipitation changes (−60%, −40%, 0%, + 40%, + 60%) in a wetland. We found that increased precipitation enhanced Gramineae abundance, thereby increasing coarse-root biomass, while fine roots changed little. Compared to CK, coarse roots directly boosted topsoil POC (+37.4%) and enhanced MAOC (+31.5%) via microbial stimulation. Furthermore, increased coarse-root biomass was associated with greater vertical transport of DOC and nitrate (NO3–), potentially contributing to higher subsoil POC (+218.7%) and MAOC (+17.2%). With increasing precipitation, the MAOC/POC ratio decreased from 1.65 to 1.11 in the topsoil and from 8.73 to 2.66 in the subsoil, suggesting that coarse roots favored POC over MAOC, increasing SOC but reducing its stability. These results provide mechanistic insights into wetland carbon-climate feedbacks under altered precipitation regimes."

Here, we investigate why two widely used chemical mechanisms in the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) predict inconsistent ozone levels and conflicting responses to emission reductions over major city clusters of China. By combining process analysis with an explainable machine learning technique, we reveal that these discrepancies primarily stem from differences in the rates of  ozone-forming and -suppressing reactions involving hydroperoxy (HO2) and organic peroxy (RO2) radicals between the two mechanisms. This thereby underscores the need for a more accurate depiction of volatile organic compounds reactivity in models. We further quantify the impact of these discrepancies by projecting ozone levels across China from 2030 to 2060 under the carbon neutrality emission reduction scenario. Divergences peak in 2030, with the two mechanisms disagreeing on whether ozone mitigation in city clusters is achievable. Over time, their predictions begin to converge. By 2060, both mechanisms agree that nearly the entire Chinese population will experience reduced ozone levels, and support the continued reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions as an effective strategy for curbing ozone pollutions. However, significant differences persist in the magnitude of reductions, with one mechanism projecting greater policy efficacy. Continued efforts are therefore required to further reduce the model uncertainty."

To overcome this issue, we have developed a nanoconfined transport layer by coassembling cyclodextrin-MOF and exfoliated LDH nanosheets within the polyamide layer. Cyclodextrin-MOF offers adsorption sites and steric hindrance that temporarily retain boron species, while single-layer LDH forms hydrophilic channels for fast water transport, together creating a dual-channel mechanism for efficient boron-water separation. The optimized membrane has a boron rejection of 82.24% and a NaCl rejection of 99.27% using a feed containing 5 ppm of boron and 2,000 ppm of NaCl. In addition, the separation performance remains stable for 96 h without degradation. Its efficacy is further validated by using seawater RO permeate, where the boron concentration is reduced below the threshold of WHO drinking water. Mechanistic analyses highlight the role of hydrogen bonding in impeding boron diffusion.

This study demonstrates that dissolved SO2 reacts directly with major biogenic terpenoids (α-pinene, β-pinene, d-limonene, β-caryophyllene, and α-terpineol) in atmospheric condensed phases to form OSs without the need for traditional oxidants. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry confirms product molecular formulas consistent with field measurements. Kinetic experiments reveal that α-pinene reacts with SO2 at a second-order rate constant of 4.0 ± 0.9 M–1 s–1 in a 50 vol % acetonitrile/water mixture, with the rate increasing nonlinearly as water content rises, reaching 12 ± 1 M–1 s–1 at 70 vol % water. pH-dependent experiments suggest that this reaction of α-pinene can occur at rates of 60–80 M–1 s–1 at pH 3–5, typical of cloud and aerosol water. This pathway could substantially contribute to OS formation and improve multiphase model predictions. Given that dissolved SO2 concentrations (∼10–3 M) far exceed those of OH, O3, or NO3 in aqueous phase, this pathway may rival or even surpass established oxidant-based sinks for terpenoids, contributing substantially to OS formation. Incorporating terpenoid + SO2 aqueous chemistry into multiphase models could thus enhance predictions of aerosol composition, particle acidity, and climate-relevant properties."

Yet, little is known about their atmospheric abundance and variability due to emissions, transport and transformation processes. This study addressed this gap by quantifying six tire additives that serve as markers for the indirect detection of TRWP in complex environmental samples. Using a newly developed analytical workflow based on high-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), we traced three antiozonants, N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N′-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD), N-isopropyl-N′-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (IPPD), and N,N′-diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPPD), their oxidation products (6PPD quinone and IPPD quinone), and the vulcanization accelerator 1,3-diphenylguanidine (DPG) across a wide range of sample types. This single-method framework enabled us to observe marker variabilities, from pristine tire material to abrasion-related emissions from the testbed and road, airborne ultrafine particles (UFPs), and total atmospheric deposition. Marker composition varied strongly with source, emission conditions, and environmental exposure. During abrasion, 6PPD decreased by ∼90%, while 6PPD quinone increased along the emission pathway. In ambient UFP from six Bavarian (Germany) sites, mean 6PPD concentrations ranged from <0.01 to 0.55 ng m–3. In the particulate fraction in total deposition from an urban, semi-industrial site, the ratio of oxygenated and parent PPD varied seasonally, revealing a higher degree of oxidation during summer. 6PPD dominated in the autumn and winter with an average of 6.6 ± 0.91 ng m–2 day–1, while 6PPDq was highest in spring and summer with average concentrations of 5.6 ± 5.91 ng m–2 day–1 and reaching an estimated annual deposition of 1.7 ± 0.5 μg m–2 year–1. By linking source materials to atmospheric samples, this study demonstrated the traceability of TRWP along their emission pathway for the first time and highlighted the importance of accounting for the chemical transformation of dedicated marker components in assessing their environmental fate."

Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are characterized by large specific surface areas, well-defined porous structures, and tunable electronic properties, making them suitable for constructing single-atom catalysts with adjustable coordination environments. In this study, three Co-ZIF materials with distinct morphologies were synthesized and subsequently pyrolyzed, yielding cobalt-based catalysts with varied coordination structures. Among these catalysts, the Co–N–C(F) primarily features atomically dispersed Co species coordinated with four N atoms, forming Co-N4 active sites. Theoretical calculations indicate that the Co-N4 coordination structure exhibits enhanced oxygen activation compared to metallic cobalt sites, which is crucial for the degradation of intermediate products in the oxidation of HCHO. The Co–N–C (F) catalyst demonstrates superior activity in HCHO oxidation to even most noble metal catalysts. During a 710 h continuous test at 15 °C, the catalyst maintained 100% HCHO removal efficiency without observable deactivation. Simulation experiments further confirmed its practical applicability, with the catalyst module able to degrade 1 ppm of HCHO to <0.07 ppm within 2 h at room temperature. This work provides valuable insights for the development of commercial nonprecious metal catalysts for HCHO oxidation."

The additional risk from HAPs in smoke was predicted to exceed a cancer risk of 100-in-1 million for 1300 people and a HI of 1.0 for 110,000 people, all in Canada. In addition, 360,000 people in Canada were predicted to experience an increase in annual-mean PM2.5 of at least 5 μg m–3. Nearly 63 million people, 76% of which were in the U.S., were predicted to experience an increase in seasonal maximum daily 8 h average ozone greater than 1 ppb. In Canada, ozone and PM2.5 associated with the 2023 fires were estimated to result in over 3 times more attributable deaths per year than wildfire smoke in years 2013 through 2018."

The health effects are primarily associated with the inhalation of particulate matter (PM), which can lead to oxidative stress through the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological systems. The influence of PM size and gaseous oxidants on the production of ROS in the lung is understudied, as most studies to date have focused on assessing this aspect broadly in fine or coarse PM. In this work, we used a kinetic model of redox chemistry in the lung epithelial lining fluid (KM-SUB-ELF) to study the production of ROS (including hydroxyl radical; •OH) from the inhalation of size-resolved PM (spanning eight size bins between 0.18 and 10 μm), ozone (O3), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at three sites located at different distances from roadways in Toronto. The highest ROS production was found at the site located next to a major highway, with particulate pollutants being the primary contributor. The total ROS production peaked in the PM accumulation mode at all sites (up to 41% associated with submicrometer PM), following closely the size distribution of trace metals, especially Cu. The •OH production was more site-specific; it peaked in the accumulation mode with highway traffic emissions, and in quasi-ultrafine (<0.18 μm) mode in areas with moderate traffic, following the trends of soluble Fe and PM (up to 60% associated with submicron PM). ROS production in the lung was also induced by gaseous oxidants. Ozone played the dominant role, particularly at sites with moderate traffic but high O3 levels where up to 52% of ROS and 14% of •OH produced in the lung were attributed to inhaled O3. The results highlight the importance of traffic emissions, submicrometer PM, and gaseous oxidants in deriving the health effects of air pollutants in urban environments."

Here we examine the state‐dependence of PA across a wide range of climate states in an idealized moist general circulation model. We generate a phase space of climate states with different global‐mean surface temperatures and equator‐to‐pole surface temperature contrasts then perturb each with longwave radiative forcing. We find that the state‐dependence of PA is largely a superposition of two effects. Firstly, as a consequence of moist thermodynamics, latent energy transport drives stronger PA in climates with higher global‐mean surface temperatures and stronger meridional surface temperature gradients. On top of this, the ice‐albedo feedback amplifies PA in climates where the climatological ice edge sits within the polar cap."

We diagnosed and documented sub‐kilometer spatio‐temporal dynamics of flood inundation during the 2017 California ROS events, simulated by a 2‐dimensional hydrodynamic model, River Dynamical Core (RDycore). RDycore shows good performance in capturing fine‐scale flood inundation dynamics against gauge measurements (with a median correlation coefficient of 0.81) and satellite observations. On top of rainfall, snowmelt not only increases the mean maximum inundation depth (12.0%–25.1%), but also expands the total flooded area (19.9%–31.9%) and prolongs the mean flood duration (3.4%–7.1%) across the events.

A turbulent wind boundary layer drives the growth of a pre‐existing narrowband wave field until it breaks, transferring energy into the water column. Under sustained wind forcing, the wave field resumes growth. We separately analyze energy transfers during wave growth and breaking‐induced dissipation. Energy transfers are dominated by pressure input during growth and turbulent dissipation during breaking. Wind input during growth is balanced with dissipation during breaking over an entire growing‐breaking cycle. The wave growth rate scales with u∗/c2 ${\left({u}_{\ast }/c\right)}^{2}$, modulated by the wave steepness due to sheltering, and the energy dissipation follows the inertial scaling with wave slope at breaking, confirming the universality of the process. Following breaking, near‐surface vertical turbulence dissipation profiles scale as z−1 ${z}^{-1}$, with their magnitude controlled by the breaking‐induced dissipation."

This review aims to critically evaluate the current methodologies employed in spatiotemporal analyses of CVDs and provides recommendations to enhance the accuracy and practical application of these models. A systematic search of the literature was conducted using Scopus, PubMed, and Embase databases. Studies were selected based on their use of spatiotemporal models to assess the relationship between environmental factors and CVDs. We evaluated the methodological quality of included studies using the Spatial Methodology Appraisal of Research Tool (SMART). Significant challenges were noted, including the need for higher spatial resolution data sets and improved methods for addressing the modifiable areal and temporal unit problems and ecological bias. Additionally, the visualization of spatiotemporal data remains underutilized and underdeveloped, limiting the practical utility of the findings. We also discuss combining parameters to form an indicator that better represents environmental conditions, as well as cases where ground, satellite, or modeled data products are suitable. These recommendations could extend to other acquired chronic diseases and their relationship with environmental risk factors to improve the utility of spatiotemporal models. While spatiotemporal modeling holds considerable promise in understanding and mitigating CVD risks associated with environmental factors, appropriate data selection, addressing methodological pitfalls and reporting spatial and temporal model outcomes are necessary to enhance their reliability and impact."

 The Matteson homologation, first developed in 1980, elongates carbon chains by insertion into a C−B bond.1 This versatile reaction traditionally requires three steps: carbanion formation, nucleophilic addition to organoboron, and a thermo- or Lewis acid-promoted boronate rearrangement. These processes often demand exacting conditions, including cryogenic temperatures and handling of air- and moisture-sensitive reagents.2,3 Here, we report a Matteson-type homologation which integrates these three transformations into a one-pot electrochemical process. This proof-of-concept approach combines electroreductive defluorination with boronate rearrangement, eliminating the need for organolithium reagents, cryogenic conditions, or specialist setups. The available trifluoromethylarenes are employed as carbenoid precursors for the first time, expanding the scope of Matteson reaction. Comprehensive mechanistic studies, including identification of key reaction intermediates, DFT calculations, and electrochemical analysis, confirm the involvement of boronate formation and rearrangement in this “e-Matteson” homologation."

 Lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) maintain the specialized lipid compositions of organellar membranes1,2. In humans, many LTPs are implicated in diseases3, but for the majority, the cargo and auxiliary lipids facilitating transfer remain unknown. We have combined biochemical, lipidomic and computational methods to systematically characterize LTP-lipid complexes4 and measure how LTP gains of function affect cellular lipidomes. We identified bound lipids for approximately half of the hundred LTPs analyzed, confirming known ligands, while discovering new ones across most LTP families. Gains in LTP function affected the cellular abundance of both their known and newly identified lipid ligands, indicating comparable functional relevance of the two ligand sets. Using structural bioinformatics, we have characterized mechanisms contributing to lipid selectivity, identifying preferences based on head group or acyl chain. We demonstrate some basic principles of how LTPs mobilise their ligands. They commonly interact with several classes of lipids and exhibit broad but selective preference, not only for particular head groups, but also for lipid species with shorter acyl chains containing one or two unsaturations, suggesting that only subsets of lipid species are efficiently mobilized. The datasets represent a resource for further analysis in different cell types and states, such as those associated with pathologies."

 In 2020, a global surge of activism linked to the Black Lives Matter movement prompted scientists to stage an academic ‘strike’, drawing attention to the ethical responsibility of addressing systemic racism. This catalysed debate in conservation, adding urgency to decades of scholarship on marginalization. In this Perspective, we review this literature and examine how exclusion in conservation persists across intersections of race, class, urban–rural divides, nationality and power dynamics from local to global levels. We highlight how marginalization and ‘othering’ disproportionately affect Black, Indigenous and people of colour (BIPOC) communities, especially in the Global South. Expansion of protected areas and the prioritization of individual animal lives over human well-being can intensify such inequities. We propose a framework for more inclusive conservation: recognizing and supporting human rights, ensuring local community agency, challenging entrenched norms in BIPOC engagement, and fostering educational opportunities led by and for BIPOC communities. Amid shifting global politics, including reduced US federal support for social and conservation issues, this framework provides guidance to counter racism and exclusion. By rethinking conservation practice, it seeks to build long-lasting, equitable and inclusive approaches that respect both people and nature.

 Late Cretaceous Europe was an archipelago with a dinosaur fauna characterized by island effects such as low diversity, relictualism and insular dwarfism1. Its dinosaur communities include a unique mix of groups with typical Laurasian or Gondwanan affinities and distinctive endemics1. Chief among the latter are rhabdodontids, considered to be early-branching iguanodontians characterized by unusual dental and postcranial features and known from abundant but very incomplete fossil remains2,3. By contrast, unequivocal evidence of horned dinosaurs (ceratopsians) is puzzlingly absent4, despite their ubiquitous occurrence in contemporary ecosystems of Asia and North America. Ajkaceratops from the Late Cretaceous of Hungary was described as the first definite ceratopsian from Europe5, but this identification has been strongly disputed4. Here we describe new material of Ajkaceratops and conduct phylogenetic analyses that support its ceratopsian affinities. Our results unexpectedly demonstrate that some ‘rhabdodontid’ taxa are not, in fact, iguanodontians but actually ceratopsians. This suggests a substantial but previously hidden diversity and evolutionary history of European horned dinosaurs, and co-occurrence of iguanodontians and ceratopsians indicates greater similarity than previously appreciated to other Laurasian ecosystems. Our results challenge conventional understanding of ornithischian dinosaur evolution and indicate the need for a fundamental re-evaluation of the Late Cretaceous herbivorous dinosaur assemblages of Europe. New results indicate that rhabdodontids and the previously described Ajkaceratops are actually distinctive European ceratopsians, a group better known from Asia and North America."

 The Galaxy’s most common known planetary systems have several Earth-to-Neptune-size planets in compact orbits1. At small orbital separations, larger planets are less common than their smaller counterparts by an order of magnitude. The young star V1298 Tau hosts one such compact planetary system, albeit with four planets that are uncommonly large (5 to 10 Earth radii)2,3. The planets form a chain of near-resonances that result in transit-timing variations of several hours. Here we present a multi-year campaign to characterize this system with transit-timing variations, a method insensitive to the intense magnetic activity of the star. Through targeted observations, we first resolved the previously unknown orbital period of the outermost planet. The full 9-year baseline from these and archival data then enabled robust determination of the masses and orbital parameters for all four planets. We find the planets have low, sub-Neptune masses and nearly circular orbits, implying a dynamically tranquil history. Their low masses and large radii indicate that the inner planets underwent a period of rapid cooling immediately after dispersal of the protoplanetary disk. Still, they are much less dense than mature planets of comparable size. We predict the planets will contract to 1.5–4.0 Earth radii and join the population of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes that nature produces in abundance. A nine-year transit-timing campaign has measured the extremely low masses and densities of four large planets orbiting the young star V1298 Tau, which are now predicted to contract and form a typical compact super-Earth and sub-Neptune system."

 The brain’s connectome1–3 and the vascular system4 are examples of physical networks whose tangible nature influences their structure, layout and, ultimately, their function. The material resources required to build and maintain these networks have inspired decades of research into wiring economy, offering testable predictions about their expected architecture and organization. Here we empirically explore the local branching geometry of a wide range of physical networks, uncovering systematic violations of the long-standing predictions of wiring minimization. This leads to the hypothesis that predicting the true material cost of physical networks requires us to account for their full three-dimensional geometry, resulting in a largely intractable optimization problem. We discover, however, an exact mapping of surface minimization onto high-dimensional Feynman diagrams in string theory5–7, predicting that, with increasing link thickness, a locally tree-like network undergoes a transition into configurations that can no longer be explained by length minimization. Specifically, surface minimization predicts the emergence of trifurcations and branching angles in excellent agreement with the local tree organization of physical networks across a wide range of application domains. Finally, we predict the existence of stable orthogonal sprouts, which are not only prevalent in real networks but also play a key functional role, improving synapse formation in the brain and nutrient access in plants and fungi. Analysis of the local branching geometries of several physical networks shows violations of predictions of length and volume minimization, leading to the hypothesis that estimating the material cost requires accounting for the full three-dimensional geometry."

 In all domains of life, tRNAs mediate the transfer of genetic information from mRNAs to proteins. As their depletion suppresses translation and, consequently, viral replication, tRNAs represent long-standing and increasingly recognized targets of innate immunity1–5. Here we report Cas12a3 effector nucleases from type V CRISPR–Cas adaptive immune systems in bacteria that preferentially cleave tRNAs after recognition of target RNA. Cas12a3 orthologues belong to one of two previously unreported nuclease clades that exhibit RNA-mediated cleavage of non-target RNA, and are distinct from all other known type V systems. Through cell-based and biochemical assays and direct RNA sequencing, we demonstrate that recognition of a complementary target RNA by the CRISPR RNA triggers Cas12a3 to cleave the conserved 5′-CCA-3′ tail of diverse tRNAs to drive growth arrest and anti-phage defence. Cryogenic electron microscopy structures further revealed a distinct tRNA-loading domain that positions the tRNA tail in the RuvC active site of the nuclease. By designing synthetic reporters that mimic the tRNA acceptor stem and tail, we expanded the capacity of current CRISPR-based diagnostics for multiplexed RNA detection. Overall, these findings reveal widespread tRNA inactivation as a previously unrecognized CRISPR-based immune strategy that broadens the application space of the existing CRISPR toolbox.

 Vision can inform animals as they navigate their environment. Landmarks can be used to maintain heading, while optic flow can be integrated to estimate turning. Although it has been shown that head direction (HD) neurons in various species use these visual cues1,2, the circuit mechanisms underlying this process in vertebrates remain unknown. Here we asked whether and how the recently identified HD cells in the larval zebrafish3, one of the smallest vertebrate models, incorporate visual information. By combining two-photon microscopy with a panoramic virtual reality setup, we demonstrate that the zebrafish HD cells can reliably track the orientation of multiple visual scenes, exploiting both visual landmarks and optic flow cues. The mapping between landmark cues and heading estimates is idiosyncratic across fish and experience dependent. Furthermore, we show that landmark tracking requires the lateralized projection from the habenula to the interpeduncular nucleus4, a structure innervated by HD neuron processes3. The physiological and morphological parallels suggest that a Hebbian mechanism similar to the fly ring neurons5,6 is at work in the habenula axons. Overall, our observation that hindbrain HD cells of larval zebrafish can utilize the visual cues despite the lack of an elaborate visual telencephalon sheds new light on the evolution of navigation circuitry in vertebrates.

 Room-temperature sodium–sulfur (Na–S) batteries offer a sustainable energy storage solution to conventional lithium (Li)-based systems1–3, owing to the high element abundances and theoretical electrochemical performance4,5. However, their practical applications have been severely hindered by the low discharge voltages and the need for largely excessive Na metal anode6–8. Here we report a 3.6 V class Na–S battery featuring a high-valence sulfur/sulfur tetrachloride (S/SCl4) cathode chemistry and anode-free configuration. We show that sodium dicyanamide (NaDCA) can simultaneously unlock reversible S/SCl4 conversion and Na plating/stripping in a non-flammable chloroaluminate electrolyte. This design enables the maximum energy and power densities of 1,198 Wh kg−1 and 23,773 W kg−1, respectively, calculated on the basis of the total electrode mass including both the cathode and the anode. Also, we demonstrate facilitated S/SCl4 conversion by incorporating a bismuth-coordinated covalent organic framework (Bi-COF) catalyst (8 wt% loading) into the S cathode, which realizes an impressive discharge capacity of 1,206 mAh g(sulfur+catalyst)−1, contributing to a maximum energy density of 2,021 Wh kg−1 calculated on the basis of the total electrode mass. With an estimated cost of US$5.03 per kWh and excellent scalability, our anode-free Na–S battery shows promise in grid energy storage and wearable electronics.

 Across the North Pacific Ocean, the mid-latitude storm track accounts for most of the heat and moisture transport into the Arctic and western North America, considerably influencing regional precipitation and temperature patterns1,2. By the end of this century, the winter North Pacific storm track is projected to shift polewards3–6, with substantial implications for oceanic ecosystems and land-based water availability1,7. Although atmospheric reanalyses suggest a polewards shift of the storm track7–12, the lack of an observed wind record has left it uncertain whether the storm-track shift has occurred in recent decades, and what role climate change plays in determining the storm-track position. Here we derive an observational constraint for mid-latitude storm tracks and show that the winter North Pacific storm track has shifted substantially polewards, emerging from natural variability. A polewards shift of storm track-induced heat and moisture flux is also evident over western North America, implying regional impacts on precipitation and temperature patterns. Our analysis further reveals that climate models underestimate the polewards shift of the storm track in recent decades, suggesting that the future human-induced impacts on both the North Pacific ecosystem and western North America might be larger than in current predictions. An observation-based storm-track proxy shows that the winter North Pacific storm track has shifted substantially polewards, suggesting regional impacts on precipitation and warming patterns, with implications for temperature variability and extreme events."

 Animals continuously evaluate their surroundings to decide whether to approach rewarding opportunities or avoid potential threats. Assigning the appropriate importance to environmental stimuli is not only crucial for survival but also underlies complex forms of goal-directed behaviour that are shared across species, including humans1–4. Understanding how the brain translates such sensory cues into motivated behaviours is, therefore, central to neuroscience and psychology. The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) is a critical structure that bridges relevant environmental stimuli to goal-directed behaviour. Salience, valence and value are key dimensions defining stimulus relevance, but how the dmPFC processes and organizes such dimensions to drive motivated behaviour remains unclear. Here we monitored single-neuron populations in the dmPFC using calcium imaging in freely moving male mice while discriminating between stimuli predicting different reward or punishment outcomes, which enabled an unprecedented dissociation of salience, valence and value information. We found that dmPFC populations primarily encode appetitive and aversive values of learned stimuli and that subpopulations encode valence and salience along orthogonal information axes. Our results highlight a concurrent multifaceted population coding of value, salience and valence of stimuli during associative learning within dmPFC networks, such that the geometry of dmPFC neuronal representations dynamically shapes appetitive and aversive motivated behaviours. The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex encodes the value, salience and valence of learned stimuli along distinct neural dimensions, and the geometry of these representations shapes motivated behaviours in mice."

 The stromal cell compartment plays a central part in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis by coordinating with the immune system throughout inception, amplification and resolution of inflammation1. Chronic inflammation can impede the phased regulation of tissue restitution, resulting in the scarring complication of fibrosis. In inflammatory bowel disease, stromal fibroblasts have been implicated in treatment-refractory disease and fibrosis2,3; however, their mechanisms of activation have remained undefined. Through integrative single-cell and spatial profiling of intestinal tissues from patients with inflammatory bowel disease, we uncovered a pathological cell nexus centred on inflammation-associated fibroblasts. These fibroblasts were induced by proinflammatory macrophages (FCN1+IL1B+) and, in turn, produced profibrotic cytokine IL-11. We investigated the inflammation-associated fibroblast activation program at a mechanistic level using genome-wide CRISPR knockout and activation screens and identified the transcription factor GLIS3 as a key regulator of a gene regulatory network governing expression of inflammatory and fibrotic genes. We further demonstrated that the magnitude of the GLIS3 gene expression program in intestinal biopsies could be used to stratify patients with ulcerative colitis by disease severity, and that fibroblast-specific deletion of Glis3 in mice alleviated pathological features of chronic colitis. Taken together, our findings identify a critical immune–stromal cell circuit that functions as a central node in the inflammation–fibrosis cycle. Integrated single-cell and spatial data analysis, combined with bidirectional CRISPR screens, identify the transcription factor GLIS3 as a key driver of chronic inflammation and fibrosis and a potential marker of disease severity in patients with ulcerative colitis."

 Monitoring internal physiological signals is essential for effective medical care1, yet most current technologies rely on external measurements or imaging systems that cannot capture enough deep-tissue dynamics2–6. Implantable devices offer a solution, but conventional designs often require batteries or magnets7–11, which carry risks during removal, and existing biodegradable sensors based on passive inductor–capacitor circuits are limited by short readout distances and unstable communication issues12–19. Here we describe a soft, biodegradable, wireless sensing device that can monitor pressure, temperature and strain over long distances (up to 16 cm), maintaining accuracy across varying positions and angles. This is achieved through a ‘pole-moving sweeping’ readout system combined with a folded structure that integrates mechanical flexibility with electromagnetic function. In vivo tests in the abdominal cavity of horses reliably captured deep-tissue pressure and temperature, and ex vivo measurements demonstrated accurate strain monitoring without strict positional control.

 Palaeogenetic evidence suggests that the last common ancestor of present-day humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans lived around 765–550 thousand years ago (ka)1. However, both the geographical distribution and the morphology of these ancestral humans remain uncertain. The Homo antecessor fossils from the TD6 layer of Gran Dolina at Atapuerca, Spain, dated between 950 ka and 770 ka (ref. 2), have been proposed as potential candidates for this ancestral population3. However, all securely dated Homo sapiens fossils before 90 ka were found either in Africa or at the gateway to Asia, strongly suggesting an African rather than a Eurasian origin of our species. Here we describe new hominin fossils from the Grotte à Hominidés at Thomas Quarry I (ThI-GH) in Casablanca, Morocco, dated to around 773 ka. These fossils are similar in age to H. antecessor, yet are morphologically distinct, displaying a combination of primitive traits and of derived features reminiscent of later H. sapiens and Eurasian archaic hominins. The ThI-GH hominins provide insights into African populations predating the earliest H. sapiens individuals discovered at Jebel Irhoud in Morocco4 and provide strong evidence for an African lineage ancestral to our species.

 The evolution of multicellularity is considered to be a major transition in the history of life on Earth1. In the evolution from unicellularity to obligate multicellularity, facultative clonal multicellularity may constitute an intermediate state, in which unicellular proliferation and clonal multicellular growth are switchable2–4. However, little is known about the mechanisms of switching. Here we identify the genetic and cellular basis of nutrition-responsive facultative clonal multicellularity in two black-yeast species of Dothideomycetes. Deletion of any one of ten genes in Hortaea werneckii5,6 results in near-obligate unicellularity or multicellularity. Six of these genes encode regulators of conidiation (asexual sporulation) in filamentous fungi7, despite conidiation not being observed in H. werneckii. Second-site mutations often restore or reverse the phenotype, revealing genetic flexibility underlying facultative multicellularity. A Myb protein functions as a switch-like regulator of state transitions in H. werneckii; its expression and degradation are coupled to nutrient conditions, stabilizing unicellular or multicellular growth. However, while conidiation regulators are similarly co-opted to enable facultative multicellularity, the Myb gene is dispensable in the related species Neodothiora pruni8, further highlighting molecular diversity in plasticity regulation. Ecologically, multicellular-prone H. werneckii ecotypes are isolated from sponges, and sponge-conditioned medium induces multicellularity. This study establishes a tractable model system for dissecting facultative clonal multicellularity across genetic, cellular and ecological scales, and outlines genetic and cellular strategies to gain, lose and regain multicellularity and, more broadly, phenotypic plasticity.

 Expansions and contractions of tandem DNA repeats generate genetic variation in human populations and in human tissues. Some expanded repeats cause inherited disorders and some are also somatically unstable1,2. Here we analysed DNA sequencing data from over 900,000 participants in the UK Biobank and the All of Us Research Program using computational approaches to recognize, measure and learn from DNA-repeat instability. Repeats at different loci exhibited widely variable tissue-specific propensities to mutate in the germline and blood. Common alleles of repeats in TCF4 and ADGRE2 exhibited high rates of length mosaicism in the blood, demonstrating that most human genomes contain repeat elements that expand as we age. Genome-wide association analyses of the extent of somatic expansion of unstable repeat alleles identified 29 loci at which inherited variants increased expansion of one or more DNA repeats in blood (P = 5 × 10−8 to 2.5 × 10−1,438). These genetic modifiers exhibited strong collective effects on repeat instability: at one repeat, somatic expansion rates varied fourfold between individuals with the highest and lowest 5% of polygenic scores. Modifier alleles at several DNA-repair genes exhibited opposite effects on the blood instability of the TCF4 repeat compared with other DNA repeats. Expanded repeats in the 5′ untranslated region of the glutaminase (GLS) gene associated with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (odds ratio (OR) = 14.0 (5.7–34.3, 95% confidence interval (CI))) and liver diseases (OR = 3.0 (1.5–5.9, 95% CI)).

 Phase-change thermal batteries for renewable energy storage and waste heat recovery demand high energy density and fast charging1–5, which are mutually exclusive because phase-change materials (PCMs) with high melting enthalpy are usually poor heat conductors6–8. The charging rate can be improved by making composite phase-change materials (CPCMs) with increased thermal conductivity9 and/or by exerting an external force to realize close-contact melting (CCM)10–12. However, these methods inevitably result in energy density losses and/or extra energy consumption. Here we report a strategy to boost the charging rates without sacrificing energy density, based on a rational design of a composite coating that enables slip-enhanced close-contact melting (sCCM) inside sealed thermal batteries. Using organic PCMs, we demonstrate a record-high power density of 1,100 ± 2% kW m−3 in a prototype. Our coating design integrates a pulse-heated (PH) layer that premelts the PCM to initiate CCM, together with a liquid-like slip surface that ensures unimpeded sinking of the remaining solid and sustains the sCCM mode throughout charging. We develop a model to explain how the slip surface enhances the charging rate. With high cycling life, adaptability and scalability, this strategy is generalizable to diverse PCMs, enabling high-performance thermal energy storage over a wide range of temperatures.

 Type 2 inflammation at barrier surfaces is an evolutionarily conserved response that promotes immunity to helminth parasites, allergic inflammation and tissue repair1–4. Direct sensing of environmental triggers by epithelial cells initiates type 2 inflammation, and signals derived from neurons can modulate immune responses5–8. However, how diverse sensory inputs from epithelial, neuronal and immune cells are coordinated and integrated remains unclear. Here we identify that TRPV1+ pain-sensing nociceptors co-opt chemosensory epithelial tuft cells to initiate a cascade of tissue responses that drive type 2 inflammation. Chemogenetic silencing or chemical ablation of TRPV1+ nociceptors results in a significant reduction in intestinal tuft cells and defective anti-helminth type 2 immunity. By contrast, chemogenetic activation of TRPV1+ nociceptors leads to remodelling of CGRP+ nerve fibres, significantly increased CGRP expression, enhanced tuft cell accumulation and protective anti-helminth type 2 immunity. Using spatial transcriptomic and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses, we reveal that nociceptor activation promotes rapid epithelial progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. Mechanistically, intestinal epithelial cell-intrinsic and tuft cell-intrinsic expression of CGRP receptor subunits are required for tuft cell responses and type 2 immunity to helminth infection. Together, these results identify sensory convergence of a neuronal–epithelial tuft cell circuit as a critical upstream determinant of type 2 immunity and tissue adaptation.

 Cancer metastasis is a major contributor to patient morbidity and mortality1, yet the factors that determine the organs where cancers can metastasize are incompletely understood. Here we quantify the absolute levels of 124 metabolites in multiple tissues in mice and investigate how this relates to the ability of breast cancer cells to grow in different organs. We engineered breast cancer cells with broad metastatic potential to be auxotrophic for specific nutrients and assessed their ability to colonize different tissue sites. We then asked how tumour growth in different tissues relates to nutrient availability and tumour biosynthetic activity. We find that single nutrients alone do not define the sites where breast cancer cells can grow as metastases. In addition, we identify purine synthesis as a requirement for tumour growth and metastasis across many tissues and find that this phenotype is independent of tissue nucleotide availability or tumour de novo nucleotide synthesis activity. These data suggest that a complex interplay between multiple nutrients within the microenvironment dictates potential sites of metastatic cancer growth, and highlights the interdependence between extrinsic environmental factors and intrinsic cellular properties in influencing where breast cancer cells can grow as metastases.

 Over the past decades, remarkable progress has been made in reducing the loss of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) within the telecom band1–4, facilitating on-chip applications spanning low-noise optical5 and microwave synthesis6, to lidar7 and photonic artificial intelligence engines8. However, several obstacles arise from the marked increase in material absorption and scattering losses at shorter wavelengths9,10, which prominently elevate power requirements and limit performance in the visible and near-visible spectrum. Here we present an ultralow-loss PIC platform based on germano-silicate—the material underlying the extraordinary performance of optical fibre—but realized by a fully CMOS-foundry-compatible process. These PICs achieve resonator Q factors surpassing 180 million from violet to telecom wavelengths. They also attain a 10-dB higher quality factor without thermal treatment in the telecom band, expanding opportunities for heterogeneous integration with active components11. Other features of this platform include readily engineered waveguide dispersion, acoustic mode confinement and large-mode-area-induced thermal stability—each demonstrated by soliton microcomb generation, stimulated Brillouin lasing and low-frequency-noise self-injection locking, respectively. The success of these germano-silicate PICs can ultimately enable fibre-like loss onto a chip, leading to an additional 20-dB improvement in waveguide loss over the current highest performance photonic platforms. Moreover, the performance abilities demonstrated here bridge ultralow-loss PIC technology to optical clocks12, precision navigation systems13 and quantum sensors14.

 Position exchange of non-Abelian anyons affects the quantum state of their system in a topologically protected way1. Their expected manifestations in even-denominator fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems offer the opportunity to directly study their unique statistical properties in interference experiments2. Here we present the observation of coherent Aharonov–Bohm interference at two even-denominator states in high-mobility bilayer-graphene-based van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures by using the Fabry–Pérot interferometry technique. Operating the interferometer at a constant filling factor, we observe an oscillation period corresponding to two flux quanta inside the interference loop, ΔΦ = 2Φ0, at which the interference does not carry signatures of non-Abelian statistics. The absence of the expected periodicity of ΔΦ = 4Φ0 may indicate that the interfering quasiparticles carry the charge

We show how standard electron-beam patterning tools can spatially encode arbitrary textures that can be hidden and shown on demand. Similarly, by modulating the topography of optical Fabry–Pérot cavities, we create colour patterns that can be continuously tuned with microfluidic control to achieve several distinct appearance states, allowing them to camouflage with different backgrounds. Finally, by creating multilayer devices, we demonstrate independent control of texture and colour in a single device, enabling a higher level of dynamic control over visual appearance. Inspired by dynamic textural modulation in cephalopod skin, polymer films whose colour and surface texture can be dynamically and independently controlled are developed and demonstrated using standard electron-beam patterning tools."

 Primary sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) have long axons and a high demand for mitochondria, and mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in peripheral neuropathy after diabetes and chemotherapy1,2. However, the mechanisms by which primary sensory neurons maintain their mitochondrial supply remain unclear. Satellite glial cells (SGCs) in DRG encircle sensory neurons and regulate neuronal activity and pain3. Here we show that SGCs are capable of transferring mitochondria to DRG sensory neurons in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo by the formation of tunnelling nanotubes with SGC-derived myosin 10 (MYO10). Scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed tunnelling nanotube-like ultrastructures between SGCs and sensory neurons in mouse and human DRG. Blockade of mitochondrial transfer in naive mice leads to nerve degeneration and neuropathic pain. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing and in situ hybridization revealed that MYO10 is highly expressed in human SGCs. Furthermore, SGCs from DRG of people with diabetes exhibit reduced MYO10 expression and mitochondrial transfer to neurons. Adoptive transfer of human SGCs into the mouse DRG provides MYO10-dependent protection against peripheral neuropathy. This study uncovers a previously unrecognized role of peripheral glia and provides insights into small fibre neuropathy in diabetes, offering new therapeutic strategies for the management of neuropathic pain. Mitochondria that are transported from satellite glial cells in dorsal root ganglia to peripheral sensory neurons through tunneling nanotube-like structures provide protection against peripheral neuropathy."

 Decreased cross-presentation by antigen-presenting cells induces the scarcity of tumour-reactive T cells within the tumour bed, rendering in situ T cell rejuvenation through immunogenicity reprogramming highly desirable yet challenging1–3. Here we developed an intratumoural vaccination chimera (iVAC) to reprogram tumour cells into an antigen-presenting state (APC-like tumour cells) with restored anti-tumour immunity. The iVAC chimeras consist of a covalently engineered PD-L1 degrader conjugated to immunogenic antigens, which could relieve immune checkpoint inhibition while enforcing the cross-presentation of exogenous antigens. Functionally, the iVAC-induced antigen processing and presentation elicited potent tumour killing through reactivation of resident antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, which simultaneously remodelled the tumour microenvironment to promote durable tumour-specific immunity. Extending this strategy, we used iVAC with a cytomegalovirus (CMV)-derived antigen to activate CMV-specific T cells against breast cancer in vitro, in a humanized mouse model as well as in a patient-derived tumour model. This study establishes a foundation for chemically reprogramming cancer cells within tumour beds to endow APC-like functions, providing an avenue for stimulating anti-tumour immunity.

 Yakut communities from northeastern Siberia inhabit some of the coldest environments on Earth, preserving an extraordinary archaeological record. Their history was profoundly reshaped by the Russian conquest, which introduced cereals, pathogens and Christianity beginning in 1632 (refs. 1–5). However, the biological impact of these transformations remains unknown. Here we generated extensive ancient DNA data to elucidate contemporary changes in Yakut genomic diversity and oral microbiomes. We found Yakut origins tracing back to local populations that admixed with Trans-Baikal groups migrating as the Great Mongol Empire spread. Despite the Russian conquest, the Yakut gene pool and oral microbiomes appeared largely stable, although smallpox strains distinct from those documented in Europe by approximately 1650 circulated. Marital practices generally maintained low consanguinity, with the exception of one female bearing the latest markers of traditional shamanism, who was the daughter of second-degree relatives.

 The anterior cingulate cortex is a key brain region involved in the affective and motivational dimensions of pain, but how opioid analgesics modulate this cortical circuit remains unclear1. Uncovering how opioids alter nociceptive neural dynamics to produce pain relief is essential for developing safer and more targeted treatments for chronic pain. Here we show that a population of cingulate neurons encodes spontaneous pain-related behaviours and is selectively modulated by morphine. Using deep learning behavioural analyses combined with longitudinal neural recordings in mice, we identified a persistent shift in cortical activity patterns following nerve injury that reflects the emergence of an unpleasant, affective chronic pain state. Morphine reversed these neuropathic neural dynamics and reduced affective–motivational behaviours without altering sensory detection or reflexive responses, mirroring how opioids alleviate pain unpleasantness in humans. Leveraging these findings, we built a biologically inspired chemogenetic gene therapy that targets opioid-sensitive neurons in the cingulate using a synthetic μ-opioid receptor promoter to drive inhibition2. This opioid-mimetic chemogenetic gene therapy recapitulated the analgesic effects of morphine during chronic neuropathic pain, thereby offering a new strategy for precision pain management that targets a key nociceptive cortical opioid circuit with safe, on-demand analgesia.

 The medial temporal lobe, and particularly the hippocampus, has been proposed to encode items in context1,2. Although hippocampal memory representations are largely context-dependent in rodents3,4, concept cells in humans appear to be context-invariant5. However, it remains unknown how item and context information are combined to form or retrieve integrated item-in-context memories at the single-neuron level in humans. Here we show that coordinated activity of distinct neuronal populations supports item-in-context memory. In a context-dependent picture-comparison task, we recorded 3,109 neurons from 16 neurosurgical patients, identifying 597 stimulus-modulated (pre-screened) and 200 context-modulated neurons (2.95% in the amygdala, 7.68% in the parahippocampal cortex, 5.68% in the entorhinal cortex and 9.42% in the hippocampus). Their co-firing combined different comparison questions (contexts) with two subsequent pictures (stimuli) through neuronal reinstatement of question contexts. Both populations were largely separate, generalized across the preferred dimension of each other, and covaried with behavioural performance. Following experimental pairing of stimuli and context, firing of entorhinal stimulus neurons predicted that of hippocampal context neurons after tens of milliseconds. Overall, synaptic modifications and co-firing of stimulus and context neurons could contribute to item-in-context memory, specify which stimulus memories need to be retrieved, and even generalize memories through mutual reinstatement of largely separate, orthogonal representations. By contrast, only 50 stimulus–context neurons represented specific picture–question combinations, consistent with limited pattern separation in the human medial temporal lobe, favouring flexible generalization over rigid conjunctive coding. Single-neuron recordings in humans reveal largely separate content and context neurons whose coordinated activity flexibly places memory items in context."

 The canonical mechanism that drives cell division comprises the formation and constriction of a contractile actin ring1–3. However, this mechanism is not compatible with the early development of many vertebrates4–9. Yolk-anchored embryos typically cannot form a complete ring during early cleavage divisions, but it remains unclear how a partial circular arc with loose ends can divide the cell. Here, by combining laser ablation of the cytokinetic band with rheological measurements in vivo, we show that stiffening of the bulk cytoplasm, mediated by the interphase microtubule network, stabilizes the contractile band by anchoring it along its length during growth. Conversely, as the cell cycle progresses, the cytoplasm fluidizes, diminishing band–cytoplasmic anchoring and facilitating band ingression. This dynamic interplay between stability and growth versus instability and ingression repeats for several cell cycles until division is complete, resulting in a mechanical ratchet that drives cell division. Our study underscores the role of temporal control over cytoplasmic rheology as a key feature that drives unilateral cytokinesis in the absence of a closed actin ring. Division of embryonic cells with an incomplete contractile ring occurs by a ratchet mechanism with repeated cycles of cytoplasmic stiffening, which stabilizes the contractile actin band, and fluidization, which enables band ingression."

 Mucormycosis is an emerging, life-threatening human infection caused by Mucorales fungi1–3. Metabolic disorders uniquely predispose an ever-expanding group of patients to mucormycosis through poorly understood mechanisms1,2,4,5, suggesting that uncharacterized host metabolic effectors may confer protective immunity against this infection. Here we uncover a master regulatory role of albumin in host defence against Mucorales through the modulation of fungal pathogenicity. Our initial studies identified severe hypoalb uminaemia as a prominent metabolic abnormality and an independent biomarker of poor mucormycosis outcome across three distinct cohorts of patients with mucormycosis. Notably, purified albumin selectively inhibits Mucorales growth among a range of pathogens, and albumin-deficient mice display susceptibility specifically to mucormycosis. The antifungal activity of albumin is mediated by the release of bound free fatty acids (FFAs). Albumin prevents FFA oxidation, which otherwise abolishes their antifungal properties, and sera from patients with mucormycosis display high levels of oxidized FFAs. Physiologically, albumin-bound FFAs suppress the expression of key virulence factors by inhibiting protein synthesis, the reby rendering Mucorales avirulent in vivo. Overall, we identify a host defence mechanism that directs the pathogen to suppress its pathogenicity program in response to unfavourable metabolic cues regulated by albumin. These findings have major implications for the pathogenesis and management of mucormycosis. Albumin selectively inhibits Mucorales growth through the release of bound free fatty acids."

 Tropical forests store about half of the global forest aboveground carbon (AGC)1, yet extensive areas are affected by disturbances, such as deforestation from agricultural expansion2,3 and degradation from fires4, selective logging5, and edge effects6,7. Over time, disturbed forests can recover, gradually restoring carbon stocks and ecological functions8. However, how recovery rates vary with disturbance size, type and location remains poorly quantified. Here we use a bookkeeping approach with spatially explicit vegetation recovery curves to quantify AGC dynamics in disturbed tropical forests during 1990–2020. We find that disturbed tropical dry forests remained carbon neutral, whereas disturbed tropical humid forests experienced a net AGC loss of 15.6 ± 3.7 PgC, primarily driven by small but persistent deforestation clearings. Despite affecting only about 5% of the disturbed area, these small-size (less than 2 ha) deforestation events accounted for about 56% of carbon losses, owing to persistent land-use conversion without forest regrowth. By contrast, large fire-induced carbon losses were offset by the long-term post-fire recovery. Over time, deforestation expanded into humid forests with higher carbon stock density, intensifying AGC losses per unit area. These findings highlight the disproportionate impact of small clearings on tropical carbon losses, suggesting the need to curb land-use changes and protect young and recovering forests. A bookkeeping approach shows that disturbed tropical humid forests experienced net aboveground carbon loss during 1990–2020, primarily driven by small but persistent deforestation clearings owing to persistent land-use conversion without forest regrowth."

 The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the central circadian pacemaker, receives photic input exclusively from intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs)1,2. However, light mainly shifts the SCN clock during night-time3–5. Here we induced phase shifts in the SCN clock during the daytime in mice by activating ipRGCs using chemogenetics or violet light. Our data reveal that the inability to induce daytime shifts with light in most animals is not only attributed to the SCN, as has been proposed for decades, but also requires the limitation of ipRGC firing via depolarization block. Chemogenetic activation of ipRGCs induces large shifts during both night-time and daytime, but daytime shifts require brain circuits and neuropeptide transmitters that are dispensable for night-time shifts. Thus, propensity of ipRGCs for depolarization block not only prevents daytime shifts in mice, but also limits the magnitude of night-time shifts, suggesting that ipRGC inputs to SCN act as an integrated pacemaker across the circadian cycle. The inability of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells to shift the circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus during daytime is caused by light-dependent depolarization block of these cells."

However, how the brain integrates experiential and observational evidence is not understood. We studied the dynamics of evidence integration in a two-player game with volatile hidden states. Both humans and monkeys successfully updated their beliefs while playing the game and observing their partner, although less effectively when observing. Electrophysiological recordings in animals revealed that the anterior cingulate cortex integrates independent sources of experiential and observational evidence into a coherent neural representation of dynamic belief about the environment’s state. The geometry of population activity revealed the computational architecture of this integration and provided a neural account of the behavioural asymmetry between experiential and observational evidence accumulation.

 Heterochromatin, marked by histone H3 lysine 9 methylation, can be epigenetically inherited through cell division1–3, maintaining gene repression that preserves cell identity and enables adaptation to environmental challenges2–6. Studies on Schizosaccharomyces pombe have shown that heterochromatin propagation depends on the read–write mechanism, wherein a sufficient density of H3K9me3-modified nucleosomes, stabilized by histone deacetylases, concentrates Clr4SUV39H on chromatin to promote further deposition of H3K9 methylation7–9. Whether other mechanisms control heterochromatin propagation by means of Clr4SUV39H, a subunit of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex ClrC10–12, was unknown. Here we uncover a ubiquitin-dependent heterochromatin heritability regulatory hub (HRH) that broadly governs heterochromatin propagation, even without histone deacetylase activity. The HRH is tuned by the limiting factor Raf1DDB2, a substrate receptor for the ClrC ubiquitin ligase. In addition to linking Clr4SUV39H to other ClrC components on chromatin, Raf1DDB2 acts in a dosage-dependent manner to promote ubiquitination of histone H3 at lysine 14 (H3K14ub), which is critical for heterochromatin self-propagation. HRH is intricately linked to environmentally responsive pathways, including nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) and target of rapamycin (TOR) signalling, enabling cells to adapt to changing conditions. By modulating heterochromatin propagation, cells leverage the HRH to gain resistance to antifungal agents and adapt to high temperature. Thus, heterochromatin self-propagation is actively regulated by means of H3K14ub in response to external stimuli, with broad implications for understanding mechanisms governing rapid changes in the epigenetic landscape in physiology and disease. A histone ubiquitin-dependent regulatory hub governs stimulus-dependent heterochromatin propagation, with important implications for understanding mechanisms governing rapid changes in the epigenetic landscape in physiology and disease."

 There are no approved treatments for Lassa fever, which is estimated to cause 100,000 to 300,000 infections and 5,000 deaths annually in West Africa1,2. Recently, it was shown that 4′-fluorouridine (also known as EIDD-2749), an orally available ribonucleoside analogue, protected guinea pigs from lethal challenge with the lineage IV prototype Josiah strain of Lassa virus when treatment was delayed beyond the onset of clinical signs of disease3. Here we assessed the therapeutic efficacy of 4′-fluorouridine in an African green monkey model of Lassa fever using the contemporary and apparently more pathogenic lineage VII Togo strain of Lassa virus. Daily treatment with 4′-fluorouridine beginning 6 days after Lassa virus infection, when the monkeys were viraemic and clinically ill, resulted in rapid and complete clearance of infectious virus in 4 out of 5 monkeys, and all treated monkeys survived to the pre-determined study end-point. Targeted transcriptomics showed that cellular responses and control of cytokinaemia contributed to the development of immunity.

Viral proteins are translated efficiently despite their RNAs not having optimal codon sequences."

 Groundwater is the largest freshwater resource, supporting drinking water, irrigation and ecosystems. As natural hazards intensify and intertwine with social, political and economic challenges, short-term groundwater use is emerging as a low-cost, rapid and distributed response strategy. Here we discuss how groundwater can be used strategically during and after hazard events while safeguarding long-term sustainability. Examples of earthquake, wildfire, flood and drought events in different regions highlight the potential value of temporarily using existing wells, pumps and aquifers. However, shifts in mindsets, policies and planning are urgently needed, along with interdisciplinary and equity-focused approaches that draw on disaster sociology, environmental justice, sustainability science and sociohydrology. Examples of policy direction and thought leadership from around the world show how groundwater use is emerging across diverse hazard contexts, which could be amplified by future interdisciplinary, equity-focused research.

Nele Meckler,Oligocene deep ocean oxygen isotope variations primarily driven by temperature,"Large benthic oxygen isotope fluctuations in the Oligocene Southern Ocean primarily represent deep water temperature changes, suggesting the Antarctic ice sheet volume was relatively stable, according to a clumped isotope record. 
 Our understanding of the long-term behaviour of global climate and the Antarctic ice sheet relies heavily on the oxygen isotopic composition of marine calcite (δ18Ocalcite), which reflects a combination of ocean temperature and the amount of water stored in ice sheets. On the basis of δ18Ocalcite, the Antarctic ice sheet has been interpreted as extremely dynamic in the Oligocene, 34–23 million years ago. Yet, the proposed continental-scale ice volume changes are challenging to reproduce with models and may be overestimated owing to a larger influence of temperature on the deep-sea δ18Ocalcite than previously assumed. Here we present the first Oligocene record of orbital variability in deep ocean temperature based on benthic foraminiferal clumped isotope thermometry, a method affected only by temperature and independent of seawater chemistry. We find large, eccentricity-paced temperature variations of up to 4 °C, sufficient to explain the δ18Ocalcite cycles without requiring continental-scale ice volume changes. This finding is consistent with the simulated stability of the Antarctic ice sheet, highlighting the importance of robust independent temperature reconstructions. Our results show that the temperature in the deep Southern Ocean, and possibly globally, is highly sensitive to the seasonal distribution of insolation in an Oligocene-like climate state warmer than today.

 Radiotherapy can both activate and suppress immunity, making it difficult to predict or modulate these opposing effects for better cancer treatment. Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT), a cellular-level radiotherapy, has demonstrated remarkable therapeutic efficacy in clinical practice, but mechanistically remains inadequately explored. Here, we compare the effects of BNCT with X-ray irradiation at equivalent radiation doses on immune cells and define the immunological mechanisms behind the improved therapeutic benefit of BNCT in mouse tumour models. We find that BNCT has a minimal effect on immune cell viability, while it triggers an immunogenic tumour cell death, ultimately inducing stronger anti-tumour immunity. Additionally, single-cell RNA sequencing indicates that BNCT reshapes the tumour microenvironment by enhancing dendritic cells, T cells, and NK cells activity. Thus, these findings provide important insights into radiobiological mechanisms following BNCT and inform strategies to preserve immune cells during radiotherapy and to increase cancer treatment efficacy.

 Postoperative recurrence significantly impacts long-term survival in patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this single-arm, phase II trial (NCT04834986), 27 patients with resectable HCC at high recurrence risk received perioperative tislelizumab (anti-PD-1) plus lenvatinib (multi-kinase inhibitor). Co-primary endpoints were safety and feasibility. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), 1-year and 2-year disease-free survival (DFS), median DFS, and pathologic complete response (pCR). Post-hoc exploratory machine learning analyses identified potential predictive factors. The regimen was feasible and generally well tolerated; grade 3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 7.4%. ORR was 55.6%. Among 20 patients undergoing surgery, The Median DFS was 18.8 months (20.1-month follow-up), with 1- and 2-year DFS of 74.0% and 49.8%, and 20% achieved pCR. No unexpected safety signals were observed.

 Microcirculation monitoring is crucial for evaluating cardiovascular health and detecting organ dysfunction early, but existing bedside imaging techniques often cannot provide sufficient resolution and depth for dynamic assessment during natural physiological activities. Here, we present MOBILE (Miniaturized Omnidirectional Broadband Photoacoustic Imaging System for Living Entities), a photoacoustic imaging system that allows unrestricted microcirculatory monitoring with 40 µm resolution and penetration depth of 10 mm, allowing stratified visualization of dynamic vascular responses. This platform features an ultracompact fibre-optic sensor capable of omnidirectional ultrasound-based detection across a large bandwidth (0.3–80 MHz). The compact design of the system facilitates point-of-care monitoring through seamless integration with portable devices or existing clinical systems. Through a comprehensive evaluation of the patient’s haemodynamic parameters, MOBILE reveals distinct dynamic responses of vessels at different tissue depths, from superficial microvessels to deep subcutaneous vessels, capturing vessel-specific changes in diameter, haemoglobin concentration, and tissue oxygenation during numerous physiological challenges. This platform offers possibilities for understanding microcirculatory responses and improving critical care management through high-resolution vessel monitoring.

Here, authors employ electronegativity and configurational entropy as a design descriptor to guide the synthesis of a sodium-deficient layered oxide with an O3 stacking sequence, rendering good thermal and air stability. 
 Exploring sodium-ion layered oxides with broad compositional diversity is an important approach for the development of high-performance positive electrodes. Structural chemistry determined by composition plays a decisive role in performance improvement, but the relationship between composition and structure becomes more elusive in complex multi-component systems. Here we propose an electronegativity entropy weight concept to understand entropy-dominated phases formation. Electronegativity and configurational entropy are used to quantify key interactions in layered materials. Guided by this understanding, we design a sodium-deficient layered oxide with an O3 stacking sequence. This material demonstrates good structural and thermal stability, along with air stability (negligible performance degradation after air exposure), cycling stability (93.02% capacity retention after 200 cycles), and rate capability (retaining 69.1% capacity retention from 86.5 mA g⁻¹ to 1.73 A g⁻¹). Even in potassium-ion batteries with larger inserted ions, the material still exhibits cycling stability. This strategy provides valuable compositional guidance for the rational design of high-performance layered oxide materials.

 Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) are characterized by impairments in brain development that affect motor and cognitive systems. Early identification of NDD risk factors is crucial for prevention. Metabolomic profiling holds promise for early detection but remains underexplored in longitudinal studies. Here, we map the longitudinal metabolomic profiles in 3212 samples covering 683 metabolites from 581 mother-child pairs at six timepoints in the Danish COPSAC2010 cohort to assess childhood NDD risk over a 10-years follow-up period. Cross-validated sPLS models identify metabolic biomarkers and patterns associated with NDD, with maternal gestational week 24 metabolic profile showing the best prediction. Metabolite trajectories prior 18-month of age are linked to NDD risk. Quinolinate is consistently associated with NDD across timepoints and mediated the effect of maternal inflammation on NDD.

Here, the authors propose a regulatory mechanism underlying migrasome biogenesis and elucidate how viruses exploit this pathway to promote cell-to-cell transmission. 
 Migrasomes are migration-dependent organelles, serving as delivery packets to mediate release of cytoplasmic contents. Tetraspanin 4 (TSPAN4) acts as a marker for migrasomes and is essential for their formation. However, the regulatory mechanism(s) underlying TSPAN4-mediated migrasome biogenesis and its physiological functions remain to be elucidated. Here, we identified AMFR, an ER-resident E3 ligase, regulates migrasome formation through catalyzing the K48-linked polyubiquitination of TSPAN4 for degradation. Further, O-GlcNAcylation of AMFR by OGT at threonine 643 disrupts AMFR-TSPAN4 interactions, thereby stabilizing TSPAN4 and promoting migrasome formation. Additionally, viruses dynamically regulate migrasome formation by modulating AMFR O-GlcNAcylation and TSPAN4 ubiquitination. During the early stages of VSV or HSV-1 infection, viruses enhance migrasome formation and exploit these structures to spread among neighboring cells, whereas abolish migrasome formation during the late stages of infection. Our findings reveal a negatively regulatory mechanism governing migrasome biogenesis, and highlight how VSV and HSV-1 manipulate this process to facilitate their release.

 RNA binding proteins could regulate transcription through modulating RNA polymerase II involved transcriptional condensates with the aid of nascent RNA. However, whether this mechanism also contributes to tumorigenesis is still unknown. Here, we show the RBP AKAP95 is required for MLL rearranged leukemogenesis. Phase separation and RNA binding properties of AKAP95 modulate Pol II recruitment into condensates at genome-wide target sites. AKAP95 interact with MLL1 translocated fragment and their partial co-condensation leads to stronger AKAP95 binding towards MLL-AF9 target genes. Loss of AKAP95 significantly downregulates expression of MLL-AF9 targets and impairs MLL-AF9 driven leukemogenesis. AKAP95 is not essential for normal and regenerative hematopoiesis, rendering it an ideal target for leukemia therapeutics. As an endeavor for modifying condensates, we design a peptide JD-PI95 bridging AKAP95 to protein quality surveillance component HSP70. The peptide successfully impairs AKAP95 phase separation, attenuates gene transcription and inhibits MLLr leukemia cells proliferation. Our work demonstrates an important role of RBP condensates in tumorigenesis through regulation of transcription and a new method to perturb specific condensates for tumor inhibition.

In this work, the authors suggest minimizing its performance trade-offs via indirect bicarbonate conversion within a porous solid electrolyte reactor. 
 Carbon capture, recovery and conversion are typically done by three separate steps, which notably increases the total energy consumption and capital costs. Here we propose to indirectly convert (bi)carbonates, which are carbon-rich sorbents in alkaline carbon capture, into valuable chemicals in a porous solid electrolyte (PSE) electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) reactor while eliminating the energy-intensive CO2 recovery step. Specifically, direct feeding of (bi)carbonates into the PSE layer while performing CO2RR allows simultaneous CO2 regeneration within the PSE chamber. Impressive electrochemical performance was demonstrated, with up to 96% formate Faradaic efficiency, 95% CO2 recovery efficiency and 86% bicarbonate-to-formate conversion. Reactor versatility allowed us to obtain up to 5.0 M formate, ~50% higher than bicarbonate solubility and C2+ products with 73% selectivity, setting the state of the art for bicarbonate-fed CO2RR. Operating for at least 100 hours at 100 mA cm−2 averaging 82% CO2 recovery and 89% Faradaic efficiencies, our reactor adds economic value to alkaline carbon capture and CO2 conversion, bringing both closer to practical implementation.

Here a covalent organic framework with high CO2 capacity and cycling stability is reported to be capable of selectively and rapidly removing CO2 from open air. 
 Capturing CO2 directly from ambient air is necessary for managing carbon levels and supporting long-term climate sustainability. However, the slow adsorption and desorption kinetics of current direct air capture sorbents remain a major limitation, whereas faster kinetics allow for quicker CO2 uptake and greater air throughput—both are essential for enhancing system efficiency. In this work, we present a covalent organic framework (COF) with both fast kinetics and high CO2 uptake. The COF (termed COF-1000) exhibited a CO2 capacity of 1.31 mmol g−1 under dry conditions at 400 ppm CO2, reaching half of its capacity within 8.1 min. Under humid conditions (75% relative humidity), water further enhanced both uptake and kinetics, leading to a remarkable CO2 capacity of 2.19 mmol g−1 with a reduced half-capacity time of 6.8 min. The exceptionally fast kinetics observed for COF-1000 were further demonstrated by using outdoor air as the CO2 source, where 50 adsorption–desorption cycles were conducted within 3 days, yielding a CO2 uptake of 22.1 mmol g−1 d−1, a value exceeding the current state-of-the-art materials. These results highlight COF-1000’s potential to enable efficient, scalable direct air capture and promote sustainable carbon mitigation.

 The evolution of the Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM) over geological timescale remains uncertain1–3 despite its fundamental role in shaping regional climate4,5, ecosystems6,7, and civilizations8. Using a series of time-slice simulations with a paleo-climate model, we assess how India–Eurasia collision tectonics9,10, Tibetan Plateau (TP) uplift11,12, and atmospheric CO2 variability13 influenced ASM evolution through the Cenozoic. Our simulation-based results suggest that ASM intensification was contingent on the TP exceeding an areal mean elevation of ~ 3.5 km in the late Eocene–Oligocene (27–38 million years ago, Ma), which strengthened the upper-tropospheric temperature gradient, promoted the seasonal northward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and restructured atmospheric circulation. Initially confined to East Asia14, monsoonal rainfall expanded across South Asia by the Oligocene, coinciding with enhanced circulation and reversing the meridional relative sea surface temperature gradient in the Neotethys. While TP uplift played the primary role in early ASM evolution, declining atmospheric CO2 levels became increasingly influential after the late Miocene. These findings, supported by sedimentary records of weathering and erosion15,16, underscore the dominant role of TP in climate–tectonic interactions and ASM evolution over geological timescales."

 Owing to the rapid increase of European heat event occurrences over the past decades, the understanding of their physical drivers has become increasingly important for the scientific community. Recently, it has been shown that cold North Atlantic sea surface temperatures are strongly linked to European heat events such as in summers of 2015 and 2018. Thereby, an accurate representation of this mechanism in climate models is crucial for a more realistic European heat event simulation. Here, we investigate the mechanism by employing seven global coupled climate models, of which six models are embedded in the High Resolution Model Intercomparison Project. Our results show that, compared to the models with low-resolution versions, high-resolution ones simulate a more realistic relationship between North Atlantic sea surface temperatures and European summer temperature extremes. This is attributable to a better reproduction of the North Atlantic trough and the downstream ridge anomalies over central Europe. Improvements in high-resolution ocean configurations reduce the North Atlantic surface biases and improves air-sea interactions, thus having implications for the prediction and projection of climate extremes in the North Atlantic-European region. High-resolution climate models simulate a more realistic relationship between North Atlantic sea surface temperatures and European summer temperature extremes, because of the reduced surface temperature bias in the subpolar North Atlantic."

 In many regions, kelp forests have experienced losses due to ocean warming and other stressors, with negative impacts on ecosystems and fisheries. Detailed maps of kelp canopy extent are needed to understand the drivers of these losses, factors promoting resilience, and vulnerability to climate change. While moderate-resolution satellite data have been used to map kelp canopies over large scales, they often miss small, sparse, or nearshore canopies. We developed a convolutional neural network to map kelp canopy using Planet Dove imagery and created annual 3 m resolution maps from 2017 to 2024 across California. We show that kelp persistence during this post-disturbance period, following a marine heatwave, was positively associated with persistence before the heatwave, cooler sea surface temperatures, shallow habitats, and reduced fragmentation. There was high latitudinal variability in the effect of these drivers on persistence, highlighting the importance of data that capture ecological complexity from local to regional scales.

 Radiocarbon (14C) measurements are a powerful tool for reconstructing past solar activity and identifying extreme events caused by bursts of high-energy particles from the Sun. Such reconstructions improve understanding of long-term solar behaviour and the likelihood of hazardous particle events that are capable of disrupting modern technology. Here we present an annually resolved 14C record spanning 1 to 970 CE comprising five newly measured and three existing series from tree rings. The record is analysed with methods that combine statistical modelling of the carbon cycle, data-adaptive decomposition of solar cycles, and probabilistic detection of rapid 14C increases associated with energetic particle events.

 Synchronized droughts threaten global food security, with concerns about increased frequency and duration under climate change. However, their long-term evolution and physical limits remain unknown. We analyze 61 drought networks over 120 years (1901–2020) of Self Calibrating palmer drought severity index (sc-PDSI) data, employing a suite of network synchronization measures and empirical orthogonal functions to unravel the physical drivers and limiters of drought synchrony. Our results show that, contrary to claims that synchronized droughts could affect up to one sixth of the global land mass, the maximum synchronized area fluctuates between 1.84% and 6.5% of the total land mass. Although we observe a strong dependence between drought onset and local crop failures, global drought synchrony is shaped by a dichotomy: temperature trends exacerbate it, while precipitation variability, modulated by sea surface temperature oscillations, limits it. This suggests that although drought hubs are increasing, large-scale synchronization across multiple agricultural regions is less widespread than expected, affecting global food security strategies.

 Private forests, covering 20% of the global forest area, play a crucial role in climate change mitigation and adaptation. Yet, research on adaptation intentions among private forest owners remains limited. This study investigates the adaptation intentions of private forest owners in Canada, one of the world’s most forested countries, following the 2023 unprecedented wildfire season. Our findings reveal one of the highest levels of adaptation intention reported globally based on a comprehensive comparison of 179 covariates and an original Bayesian statistical analysis. We identify a mismatch between adaptation intentions and existing policy instruments: rather than traditional financial incentives, such as tax reductions or reimbursement schemes for forest operations, the most effective support involves providing detailed and locally relevant information on climate impacts, and technical assistance. These findings point to a substantial opportunity to leverage motivated private forest owners to establish a long-term social-ecological observatory and testing ground for adaptive forest management with global relevance.

We analyzed major elements, dissolved gases, and used thermodynamic modeling to study how the fluids react with surrounding rocks.

 Hydrothermal systems at ultraslow-spreading mid-ocean ridges remain poorly characterized, particularly where sedimentary and ultramafic influences intersect. Here we present geochemical analyses of vent fluids collected in 2024 from the Jøtul hydrothermal field on the northern Knipovich Ridge. Major element concentrations, dissolved gases, and thermodynamic modeling are used to investigate fluid-rock interactions. The fluids exhibit exceptionally high CH4 concentrations, that exceed those at the Guaymas Basin, and display characteristics typical of sediment-hosted hydrothermal systems, indicating thermal decomposition of organic matter in clastic sediments. In contrast, high H2 (>15 mM) and low H2S concentrations are more typical of ultramafic-hosted fluids, while geological evidence indicates that the vent field lies atop a detachment fault. Thermodynamic modeling suggests that these high H2/H2S ratios may result solely from degradation of organic matter followed by abiotic CH4 oxidation at ~400 °C, rather than from reactions with ultramafic rocks. These results expand the known diversity of sediment-hosted vent fluid compositions and highlight fluid-sediment interaction as an underestimated source of carbon and hydrogen. Sedimented hydrothermal systems can be a significant source of hydrogen in addition to ultramafic rock-hosted systems, according to analysis of chemical data from hydrothermal vent fluids at the Jøtul hydrothermal field.

 Treelines are generally expected to respond to climate warming by shifting to higher elevations. However, significant variations in treeline shifts across different mountain ranges have been observed, and the underlying reasons for these differences remain unclear due to the lack of comprehensive global treeline mapping. This study provides a global analysis of treeline shifts using satellite-derived forest canopy height data at a 30-meter resolution, combined with a model of potential treeline positions based on climatic data. The elevations of both observed and potential treelines were mapped for the years 2000 and 2020, and the elevational shifts in treeline positions were quantified over this period. On a global scale, 42% of observed treelines shifted upslope and 25% downslope. However, these shifts generally lagged behind climate-driven potential treeline elevations. By contrast, the rate of treeline shifts was strongly influenced by anthropogenic disturbances. Fire disturbances contributed to 38% of downslope shifts, and regions with lower overall anthropogenic disturbance had faster upslope shifts of observed treelines and thus consequently smaller lags. These findings emphasize the importance of considering both climatic and anthropogenic factors when assessing treeline dynamics and suggest that historical and ongoing human impacts play a critical role in modulating treeline responses to climate change."

 Building instance segmentation from city-scale point cloud is of great significance to urban planning management, disaster response and recovery, and land resource management. However, due to the complexity of urban scenes and sparse nature of LiDAR data, existing methods are often limited by the problems of obscured building boundaries and incomplete building structures, particularly in densely populated urban areas with diverse architectural styles. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that automatically extracts building instances from airborne LiDAR data and is especially aware of the building structures. The proposed method encompasses two main stages, building points semantic segmentation and individual building extraction. First, we design a point cloud semantic segmentation network, VPBE-Net, that innovatively utilizes voxel-point cloud fused features to efficiently extract building points from large-scale point cloud. Second, building instances are automatically and robustly extracted using a graph-based algorithm SI-DVDC, which comprehensively considers both object-level building structure property and point-level density accessibility. We evaluate the semantic segmentation performance on the DALES and Toronto datasets and the building instance segmentation performance on the UrbanBIS and City-BIS datasets. For the semantics, Overall Accuracy (OA) and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) metrics reach 88.96 % and 70.28 % on DALES dataset, and 89.26% and 75.40% on Toronto dataset, which is 2.22 % and 3.25 % higher than the state-of-the-art methods. For the building instance extraction, the instance-level quality metric reach 88.65 % on UrbanBIS dataset and 76.97 % on City-BIS dataset, respectively. The experiments verify that the proposed method can extract individual buildings from complex urban and rural environments, while being aware of diverse building structures, thereby demonstrating the remarkable generalization ability.

 Landslides represent a major type of earthquake-triggered geohazard, with their dynamic evolution influenced by the complex interaction of postseismic environmental factors. The 2017 Mw 6.4 Nyingchi earthquake triggered numerous landslides, yet research has largely focused on coseismic mapping, and there remains a lack of cataloging and characterization of postseismic landslides accelerated by the earthquake (i.e., Earthquake Accelerated Landslides, EALs). These landslides remain a serious hazard to surrounding communities, with impacts that persist well beyond the earthquake. This study employs Sentinel-1 time-series analysis to reveal the spatial distribution and postseismic deformation mechanisms of EALs. A total of 299 EALs were identified and cataloged, which are primarily distributed in high mountainous regions west of the epicenter and show a distinct linear clustering along active faults. By comparing near-field and far-field EALs, we found that far-field landslides may experience greater acceleration despite weaker ground shaking. Time-series analysis indicated a rise in EAL deformation velocity from 1.56 cm/yr (preseismic) to 5.08 cm/yr (postseismic), reflecting a strong accelerating effect of the earthquake. In addition to the deformation acceleration triggered by the mainshock, postseismic landslide deformation also exhibited seasonality correlated to precipitation and land surface temperature, as well as aftershock-induced variations. Exponential modeling further indicates a decreasing deformation trend of EALs, with stabilization occurring approximately 6.8 years after the mainshock. This research systematically examined landslide evolution after the Nyingchi earthquake, providing a basis for post-earthquake landslide hazard assessment, with particular emphasis on the increased far-field landslide hazards."

 Characterizing the evolution of urban settlements is vital for informed urban planning that mitigates associated risks. Urban development has traditionally been examined in two dimensions using Earth observation: land cover change, monitored through daytime optical remote sensing, and lighting infrastructural change, observed using nighttime remote sensing. However, these two types of change have often been analyzed in isolation, limiting a comprehensive understanding of their combined impacts on urbanization. This study bridges this gap by simultaneously analyzing monthly Black Marble nighttime light (NTL) data and World Settlement Footprint data to compare lighting and urban land cover change in the Mediterranean region. Our findings reveal that 80% of urbanization-associated pixels display either urban land expansion or lighting growth, but not both. Confusion matrix highlights regional variations: commission errors are particularly high in West Asia (74%), indicating increases in nightlights driven by densification or road improvements without corresponding land conversion. Conversely, omission errors are higher in Western Europe (52%) and North Africa (47%), where urban land expansion occurs without observable lighting infrastructure growth, reflecting phenomena such as informal settlement growth, industrial infill, and energy-saving practices. This study enhances our understanding of the urbanization process through satellite observations, emphasizing the need for a more comprehensive monitoring approach that captures the diverse dimensions of urban growth."

 This study presents the first assessment of NASA’s Phytoplankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission’s hyperspectral Ocean Color Imager (OCI) for cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) monitoring. We conducted a direct comparison of PACE OCI with Sentinel-3’s multispectral Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI), and its Cyanobacteria Assessment Network (CyAN) operational product using imagery from summer 2024 blooms in Lake Erie, Green Bay, and Clear Lake. We evaluated performance of both sensors using the established Cyanobacteria Index (CICyano) and corresponding cyanobacterial cell density (CCD) to estimate bloom biomass. PACE OCI successfully captured bloom patterns comparable to Sentinel-3 OLCI. When benchmarked against the CyAN product, OCI-derived CCD showed strong agreement (R2 = 0.84, Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) = 8.95%), though a negative bias (β≃11%) was observed for extreme bloom pixels. Validation with in situ measurements indicated that OCI significantly improved chlorophyll-a biomass retrievals compared to CyAN/OLCI (NRMSE = 21.57% for OCI vs 38.67% for CyAN/OLCI), emphasizing the value of hyperspectral observations for optically complex inland waters. Our results demonstrate PACE OCI’s capability to advance CyanoHAB monitoring, providing a critical first step in establishing continuity with existing operational products while offering new potential for improved biomass estimates and taxonomic discrimination."

 Road network information has extensive applications, such as urban planning and navigation. However, current road extraction methods mostly rely on single model architectures and single-source remote sensing images, neglecting the potential benefits of collaborative extraction with heterogeneous networks and multi-source data fusion. Moreover, existing methods often suffer from road fragmentation and poorly connected road graphs due to occlusions. To address these challenges, we propose MT-RoadNet, a local–global joint enhancement framework for extracting road surfaces and centerlines, which incorporates multi-network collaborative optimization. Specifically, MT-RoadNet adopts a dual-branch structure, which not only facilitates the collaborative extraction of local details and global semantics but also achieves the coupling of geometry and topology through a cross-task dynamic interaction mechanism. Besides, we propose the Local–Global Feature Fusion module (LGFF), which dynamically integrates local details and global semantics through multi-level feature interaction. Furthermore, to reduce interference features with high inter-class separability and low intra-class variation, we innovatively design the Visual State Space Module (VSSM) and the Spatial-Channel Mutual Attention (SCMA). The VSSM weighs features dynamically using multi-directional cross-scanning and global receptive fields, emphasizing prominent area information while improving computational efficiency. SCMA effectively guides the model to focus on semantically relevant regions. Finally, MT-RoadNet adopts a dual-path decoder to produce road surfaces and centerlines. Extensive experiments on three road datasets demonstrate that MT-RoadNet significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of road completeness and recognition accuracy of topological structure.

 Accurate daily mapping of 30-m fractional snow cover (FSC) is critical for hydrological modeling and disaster assessment. Frequent cloud cover and satellite revisit cycles create significant data gaps in high-resolution optical imagery (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel-2), hindering the continuous monitoring of rapid snow dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose the Time-series-based Adaptive snow-Fraction Fusion (TAFF) framework for generating seamless daily 30-m FSC over large scales. The core of TAFF is a dual-path fusion strategy that adapts to the physical state of the snowpack. First, a time-series-based snow stability assessment gauges the magnitude of temporal FSC change. This assessment then directs the fusion process: stable snow is processed using time-weighted fusion, while rapidly changing snow is handled by a pixel-level regression. Evaluated over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, TAFF demonstrates robust improvements over established spatiotemporal fusion algorithms, particularly under cloudy conditions. Independent validation against 215 Landsat 8 images yielded strong performance (R2 = 0.76, RMSE = 19.58 %). Further validation against 46 in-situ snow depth stations indicated a high binary classification accuracy of 0.91. As a robust and practical method for large-scale FSC mapping, TAFF shows promise for integrating additional data sources, such as geostationary and microwave sensors, to enhance the high-resolution monitoring of ephemeral snow."

 Accurate estimation of individual tree biomass in urban landscapes is critical for carbon stock assessment and urban forest management but remains challenging because of the structural complexity and species diversity of urban trees. This study presents an integrated methodological framework that combines deep learning-based tree species identification with LiDAR-derived structural parameter estimation to enable rapid and precise biomass mapping at the individual tree level. Using multiplatform LiDAR data (UAV-borne and handheld mobile laser scanning), we developed a lightweight sample generation method derived from side-view tree projections (SVP) to efficiently construct a species-adaptive training library and proposed a novel individual tree identification approach optimized with the YOLOv11 deep learning algorithm. Our framework systematically evaluated the performance of single-source versus fused LiDAR point clouds across three key metrics: species classification accuracy (achieving 87.3 % on independent test data), structural parameter retrieval (R2 = 0.925 for DBH, R2 = 0.844 for height), and biomass estimation fidelity (86.3 % agreement with field measurements). The results demonstrated that compared with single-source alternatives, data fusion reduces parameter estimation errors by 4.8–56.2 %, while the SVP strategy enables computationally efficient species-specific allometric model matching. This work advances urban forest monitoring by providing a scalable solution that balances scientific rigor with operational practicality, addressing critical gaps in high-resolution biomass mapping for heterogeneous urban ecosystems."

 This study examines the role of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in ozone (O3) formation in a medium-sized residential city in South Korea. Using continuous measurements of 53 VOC species and photochemically adjusted initial concentrations (PICs), we assessed VOC transformations and their impact on O3 production. Results show that alkenes, particularly isoprene, cis-2-butene, and propene, are dominant contributors to O3 formation, with their influence intensifying under high O3 conditions. PIC of total VOCs (36.1 ppb) were significantly higher than measured concentrations (8.3 ppb), highlighting the extent of photochemical degradation. Ozone formation potential (OFP) analysis showed that metrics based on consumed VOCs better captured O3 variability than those based on measured concentrations, underscoring the importance of accounting for photochemical processing. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) identified distinct VOC sources: while LPG/natural gas usage (23.3 %) and coal combustion (22.4 %) dominated measured VOCs, solvent usage (16.2 %) and biogenic emissions (25.7 %) contributed more substantially when PICs were considered. Regional transport also played a key role, suggesting that aged and photochemically processed air masses significantly influence downwind O3 levels. These findings demonstrate the need to prioritize the control of anthropogenic alkenes and aromatic compounds, while also considering the influence of biogenic emissions. Policy measures should incorporate photochemical transformations into source attribution frameworks to support more effective and targeted O3 mitigation strategies."

 In the morning of 12 November 2022, severe aircraft icing occurred over Anhui Province, Eastern China during weather modification operations. In-situ airborne measurements revealed the presence of a substantial concentration of supercooled droplets with effective diameter exceeding 45 μm, and liquid water content (LWC) above 1.2 g m−3 during the icing event.Given the importance of microphysical parameterization (MP) scheme for icing conditions, simulations using different multi-moment MP schemes, i.e., WDM6, NSSL, Milbrandt-Yau (MY) schemes, are conducted at 1-km grid spacing for the case. Comparisons against satellite observations indicate that the general evolution of the frontal system and surface precipitation are well reproduced by the simulations. However, all simulations underpredict upper-level clouds with cloud-top temperature below 240 K over the northeastern part of the front. Besides, WDM6 scheme produces ice cloud-top area (CTA) closest to satellite observations but only produces approximately half of the observed CTA for supercooled cloud tops. The Milbrandt-Yau scheme shows superior performance in simulating the cloud top features during the icing event. Examinations of explicit supercooled cloud water (SCW) prediction skills indicate that WDM6 generates excessive total number concentration (Nt) of small SCW, with Nt reaching up to 1011 m−3 and effective diameter (ED) below 20 μm. In contrast, the NSSL scheme produces significantly larger SCW particles but substantially lower Nt at approximately 107 m−3 and ED of above 200 μm. Notably, the particle size distribution of SCW predicted by MY scheme is more realistic compared with in-situ aircraft measurements."

This differentiability facilitates direct training on satellite-based precipitation observations, unlike previous attempts at hybrid models that relied on high-resolution simulations as training data. Our model runs at 2.8° resolution and, in the context of climate, demonstrates substantial improvements over existing GCMs, the ERA5 reanalysis, and a global cloud-resolving model in simulating precipitation. In the context of mid-range precipitation forecasting, it outperforms the ECMWF ensemble.

While local impacts on temperature and precipitation are known, the extent and underlying mechanisms of its influence on meteorological drought remain unclear. Here, we analyzed 3696 paired forest loss and intact sites across boreal, temperate, and tropical zones. Forest loss intensified meteorological drought in more than 52% of affected regions. Drought prevalence in boreal zones rose by 5% over 20 years—three times greater than in tropical zones—because of reduced latent heat flux and increased surface albedo, which together suppressed convective rainfall. In contrast, tropical forests demonstrated greater ecological resilience, mitigating ~40% of meteorological drought intensification. Notably, forest loss–induced meteorological drought may further evolve into more severe agricultural and hydrological droughts. Therefore, we recommend implementing strategies tailored for each climate zone, including native forest conservation, proactive ecological restoration, and connectivity enhancement, to effectively reduce drought risk."

We found that this in situ–forming hydrogel integrates seamlessly with tumor resection procedures, serves as a drug depot for sustained tumoral releases of therapeutic agents, and thus reprograms the tumor microenvironment by promoting M1 macrophage polarization, suppressing regulatory T cell activity, and enhancing cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration, thereby establishing a robust antitumor immune response.

Although Nat10-mediated RNA ac4C modification has been implicated in malignant hematopoiesis, its role in normal hematopoiesis remains unexplored. Here, we developed ULAC-seq to map ac4C in rare hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and revealed dynamic, cell-type–specific ac4C patterns, peaking in megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs), correlating with elevated Nat10 expression. Nat10 knockout disrupts HSC self-renewal and arrests MEP differentiation, leading to fetal and postnatal hematopoietic failure. Mechanistically, Nat10 deposits ac4C on mRNAs encoding key hematopoietic transcription regulators (e.g., Nfix), thereby enhancing their translation. Nat10 loss reduces Nfix protein levels and suppresses expression of its target genes (e.g., Mpl) that govern HSPC fate, while Nfix reconstitution rescues colony-forming defects in Nat10-null HSPCs.

Using vegetation modeling, we show that where oxygen-fire effects are dampened by high moisture, photorespiration becomes more effective through increased temperatures. Together, these processes interact to drive an 86% reduction in modeled global biomass when oxygen levels reach 35%.

This study presents a comparative single-cell RNA sequencing–based analysis of regenerating and nonregenerating digits to computationally identify fibroblast subpopulations and genes associated with fibrosis and regeneration. To test the sufficiency of identified candidate genes to alter wound healing outcomes, we developed a robust adeno-associated virus gene delivery technique for digit fibroblasts. We found that overexpression of candidate profibrotic genePcolce2orPrelpin the blastema modifies normal regeneration and overexpression of candidate proregenerative factorCcl2orMestin the proximal digit substantially increases bone deposition.

Yet little is known about its structure and function inE. colipersistence and pathogenesis. Structural investigations reveal that the adhesin receptor binding domains (RBDs) of YehD and its relative YhlD both share a canonical β-rich core and an α-helical flap motif that is hinged at the distal end of the core. This flap was observed in both open and closed conformations using molecular dynamics simulations. The closed conformation is dependent on a hydrophobic patch of amino acids on the distal end of the flap. Functionally, YehDRBDis able to bind pectin, a polysaccharide ubiquitous in plant material. Mutations that interrupt the closed conformation increase the affinity of the protein to pectin, suggesting that the flap contributes mechanistically to pectin binding. Furthermore, in vivo, the pilus contributes to gastrointestinal (GI) tract colonization in the absence of the type 1 pilus. Hence, we report the ability of YehD to bind pectin representing a possible colonization mechanism of the GI tract via a structurally distinct CUP adhesin."

However, obesity impairs the generation of beige adipocytes, and the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we show that obesity leads to a loss of adipose progenitor cells (APCs) in WAT, accompanied by reduced estrogen (E2) levels and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) expression. Supplementation with E2 or nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), an NAMPT-derived nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) precursor, restores beige adipogenesis in diet-induced obese mice. Mechanistically, estrogen receptor α (ERα) in APCs is required for beige fat formation by promotingNampttranscription. We further demonstrate that NAMPT is both necessary and sufficient to drive APC proliferation and differentiation, with interleukin-33 (IL-33) acting downstream to mediate these effects. These findings uncover a critical ERα/NAMPT/IL-33 axis that preserves progenitor function and thermogenic capacity, offering a potential therapeutic strategy to combat obesity-induced beige fat failure and associated metabolic dysfunction."

However, the mechanism that the injured lung microenvironment uses to modulate BC-mediated lung repair remains unclear. Here, we showed that the profibrotic transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) gradient from the injured lung immune microenvironment can be sensed by BCs. Targeted degradation of Smad2/3 in human BCs via proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) disrupted TGF-β signaling, causing cell hyperplasia and barrier function loss after being transplanted into the alveolar area. Genetic ablation of the TGF-β receptor orSmad4in mouse BCs impaired multilineage differentiation and suppressed migration to the alveolar injury site. These data indicated that TGF-β signaling is essential for BC-mediated lung repair. Moreover, we genetically engineered human BCs to release antifibrotic bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7) in response to microenvironmental TGF-β stimulation. Transplantation of this iBMP7-BC enhanced lung repair and reduced fibrosis. Collectively, this study delineates how TGF-β governs BC behavior and provides a microenvironment-responsive cell therapeutic strategy for pulmonary fibrosis."

InCaenorhabditis elegans, UNC-70/ß-Spectrin also functions within the epidermis to maintain the integrity of sensory neurons. The precise molecular organization in this tissue and the cellular mechanisms that mediate this protection are unknown. Here, using three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy, we show that epidermal SPC-1/α-Spectrin and UNC-70/ß-Spectrin form a crescent-shaped scaffold with a periodicity of ~200 nm that embraces adjacent axons. This epidermal Spectrin scaffold is induced by developing axons and reformed during axonal regeneration, creating a “molecular imprint” of the nervous system. Disruption of this epidermal scaffold causes axonal damage, and we propose that it protects axons by restricting the endocytosis of cell adhesion molecules required for axonal-epidermal adhesion. Our findings reveal a distinct periodic Spectrin scaffold within the epidermis that is molded by the developing nervous system and protects axons from damage."

By combining computational structure analysis and quantifying relative TFBS affinity and enhancer activity, we describe how TF concentration is converted into precise expression across the developingDrosophilawing. We show that, although the regulatory function of the enhancer generally follows the classical Hill equation, several additional terms are needed to describe the effects of affinity, orientation, sequence, and wing region on the maximum achievable expression and position of transcriptional activity in a tissue. We also found that Dll relies on two distinct sets of amino acid–DNA contacts for binding to higher affinity sites, but contacts are more evenly distributed at lower affinities. Our work integrates information at molecular and tissue scales to describe how the modulation of a single TFBS determines the regulatory function of an enhancer in a complex in vivo environment."

Previously, we induced tolerance to allogeneic islets in nonhuman primates by preemptive alloantigen delivery to antigen-presenting cells in situ. Here, mass cytometry phenotyping with incorporated donor-derived MHC-I peptide–loaded MHC-II tetramers revealed accumulation of allospecific CD4+T cell clusters in the spleen of tolerant recipients. Areg+Tr1 regulatory and terminally exhausted EGFRhiT (Tex) cells represented the predominant allospecific subsets. Trajectory analysis showed that antigen-experienced effector memory T cells differentiated into suppressive Areg+Tr1 and EGFR+TOX+Nur77+TCF-1−Tex subsets. Cell-cell communication mapping showed that exhausted and effector memory T cells engaged with allospecific Tr1 cells via the Areg-EGFR axis. Gene silencing studies confirmed that Tr1 cells use Areg-EGFR signaling to drive the metabolic suppression and epigenetic reprogramming of CD4+T cells through a Nur77-dependent pathway. These findings point to the splenic Areg+Tr1 cell-EGFR+Teff cell axis as a critical immunoregulatory pathway in peripheral transplant tolerance."

Thus, here, by parallelly analyzing the human peripheral CD4-CTLs and CD8-CTLs, we demonstrate that they are indistinguishable for the cytotoxic program. Furthermore, using an integrative multiomics approach combining the transcriptome, T cell antigen-receptor repertoire, and open chromatin profile of CD4+T cell memory subsets, we found a stem-cell memory subset that is precommitted to the cytotoxicity program. Through an in vitro differentiation model, we developed CD4+T cells with cytolytic potential coexpressing and exhibiting progressive chromatin accessibility for cytotoxicity- and longevity-associated genes, hence generating long-lived CD4-CTL effectors of varying cytotoxic capacity.

Their evolution is key to understanding Neoproterozoic paleoecology but remains mired in controversy. Molecular timescales suggest a Tonian or Cryogenian origin, while their oldest unequivocal fossils consist of disarticulated siliceous spicules from the Late Ediacaran. We derived a new, dated sponge phylogeny and tested whether ancestral sponges had mineralized skeletons. We resolve the sponge phylogeny in good agreement with current knowledge and date their origin to the early Ediacaran. Our results suggest that early sponges were not biomineralized and that both biosilicification and biocalcification evolved independently multiple times across Porifera. We reconcile fossil evidence and molecular estimates of sponge evolution by showing that the Neoproterozoic history of Porifera is limited to the Ediacaran and providing evidence suggesting that sponges are largely absent from the Ediacaran record because they were yet to evolve biomineralized skeletons."

Prototypical fission machineries use local energy input such as nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis to constrict and cut membranes. However, some membrane fission reactions paradoxically rely on protein scaffolds that by themselves stabilize rather than cut membranes. It turns out these proteins do not work alone; they use nonlocal energy input that generates a membrane tension gradient. Such a gradient mobilizes membrane flow that in turn tends to relax the membrane tension gradient. By interfering with membrane flow, the protein scaffold causes the membrane tension to increase unchecked to the point of mechanical failure, membrane fission. This friction-driven scission (FDS) mechanism is generic, conserved from bacteria to humans, and only requires two ingredients: a membrane tension generating process and a protein scaffold that hinders the associated membrane flow.
