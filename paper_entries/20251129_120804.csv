10.1088/1748-9326/ae1c54,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注海洋碳移除（mCDR）技术的监测，包括评估碳移除的效率和潜在的环境副作用。它侧重于海洋生态系统和生物地球化学过程，而非大气环境遥感技术。论文探讨了当前监测方法面临的挑战，并提出了标准化指标和监测程序的建议，旨在促进mCDR技术的发展和碳信用交易系统的应用。虽然涉及二氧化碳，但重点在于海洋环境中的碳移除，与大气成分分析、卫星观测或空气质量监测等大气遥感技术关系不大。,"['Marine Carbon Dioxide Removal', 'mCDR monitoring', 'Carbon removal rates', 'Environmental side-effects', 'Marine biogeochemical processes', 'Carbon certificate trading systems']",T M Morganti;W Yao;N Mengis;A Oschlies;G Rehder,Monitoring marine carbon dioxide removal: quantitative analysis of indicators for carbon removed and environmental side-effects,"Marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR) implementations can potentially remove 1–15 Gt CO2 yr−1, which encompasses the minimum requirement removal of CDR in 2050 to limit warming below 2 °C by 2100. Despite their potential, mCDR represents only a tiny fraction of currently deployed CDR methods. Their implementations require not only a comprehensive understanding of the marine processes involved, but also a robust monitoring for their effectiveness and potential environmental impacts. In this work, we surveyed the mCDR scientific literature to identify measurable indicators for quantitative information across different ecosystems and methods used for monitoring the carbon removed and environmental side-effects, and explore the main common challenges. We followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis protocol PRISMA: the search queries were established, and the literature search and criteria for inclusion/exclusion were transparently defined. Our results reveal the lack of a direct linkage from the mCDR-induced rates of chemical and biological changes to the amount of carbon removed from the atmosphere and the magnitude of associated environmental side-effects. The heterogeneity of marine biogeochemical and ecological processes in time and space, together with the propagation of biogeochemical signals in an open system, represent the most common challenge reported for the monitoring approaches. Our results show that we are in need of indicators that provide reliable quantification of CO2 removal rates and information on environmental side-effects. Finally, based on our gap analysis, we provide monitoring recommendations, such as the use of common metrics and the baseline establishment. Currently, the lack of standardized indicators and monitoring procedures inhibits the verification, and hence, creates risks for further investment and prevents the entering of mCDRs in existing carbon certificate trading systems, hindering the long term growth of this sector."

However, the phase-dependent relationship between concurrent ENSO-IOD events and equatorial-coastal waveguides remains unclear. Long-term SSH observations reveal two distinct waveguide modes during autumn-winter: an eastern mode propagating from eastern IO to Bay of Bengal (BOB), and a western mode extending from central IO to Arabian Sea (AS). These modes exhibit significant coherence in central IO exclusively during concurrent ENSO-IOD events, with stronger SSH anomalies occurring during positive phase. We identify a complete wave-mediated pathway in which equatorial Kelvin-coastal Kelvin waveguide interacts with equatorial Rossby-coastal Kelvin waveguide in central IO, transmitting SSH signal from eastern IO through BOB to AS coast. These results establish a dynamical framework linking ENSO-IOD phases to waveguide connectivity, improving predictability of climate-driven air–sea variability in northern IO."

Their resultant climate responses may not fully offset each other, leading to some nonlinear changes, particularly in summer precipitation over East Asia (EA). However, how the coexistence of CO2 and AAs causes the nonlinear effect on EA precipitation remain unclear. Through analyses of fully coupled model simulations, this study shows that when both forcings are included, the precipitation over North China in July–August decreases less than the linear combination of the changes induced by individual forcings, indicating a nonlinear increase of precipitation. These nonlinear changes over EA likely originate from the Arctic and North Atlantic region. Specifically, the Arctic sea-ice sensitivity to the CO2-induced warming is higher than that to the AA-induced cooling, leading to a large increase of sea ice concentration over the East Siberian–Beaufort Seas in the nonlinear effect. This can excite an anomalous atmospheric Rossby wave propagating southeastward into the North Atlantic, which increases low cloudiness to cool the surface over the midlatitude North Atlantic. This cooling subsequently generates an anomalous Rossby wave train pattern across Eurasia with two branches propagating toward EA. The concurring circulation changes over EA ultimately result in nonlinear precipitation changes there. This study suggests that the nonlinear climate response in the high latitudes can remotely induce nonlinear changes in the lower latitudes and highlights the need to consider nonlinear effects in analyzing externally forced climate changes over EA."

This study leverages Google Trends search activity (2016–2024) across 30 major US metropolitan areas to quantify digital responses to heat. Using generalized additive models, two key response metrics are identified: a temperature ‘threshold’ that triggers public concern and a ‘slope difference’ that measures the intensity of the subsequent reaction. The analysis first establishes that a city’s median climate primarily determines its baseline threshold, while the variability of climate governs the slope difference, both reflecting long-term adaptation to local conditions. After accounting for these climatic effects, the study finds that socioeconomic factors explain a significant portion of the remaining variance in digital heat responsiveness. Specifically, the climate-adjusted threshold is higher in cities with greater social vulnerability, indicating a dangerous delay in awareness. This interplay creates five distinct urban typologies, revealing that temperate coastal cities exhibit a highly reactive pattern while arid inland cities show a response buffered by modern infrastructure. These findings uncover a critical disconnect wherein the populations most at risk are often the last to digitally engage with the threat. This digital proxy provides a new, near real-time method for monitoring public risk perception, offering a vital resource for developing more equitable public health interventions against the escalating threat of extreme heat."

However, its spatio-temporal patterns and potential impacts on water quantity and quality remain poorly understood compared to those of wildfires. By analyzing the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity database (1984–2022), we characterized distinct regional, seasonal and interannual dynamics of large prescribed fires relative to wildfires across the conterminous United States. We found the Southeast dominated the national prescribed fire regime, accounting for 78.6% of total prescribed fire occurrences and 70.7% of total burned area. Seasonally, prescribed fires primarily occurred in the spring, contrasting with wildfires that peak in autumn, particularly in the West and Southwest. Prescribed fires in the Southeast increased significantly from the early 2000s, peaking around 2010, then temporarily declined, whereas wildfires in the West exhibited an overall upward trend with substantial interannual variability. Our synthesis of studies from 1969 to 2024 showed that prescribed fire could potentially reduce evapotranspiration, but increase surface runoff through alterations of vegetation structure, rainfall partitioning, soil properties, and flow generation processes. Additionally, prescribed fire may influence water quality by modifying soil nitrogen dynamics, dissolved carbon, erosion, and sediment transport. However, these impacts are typically short-lived and can be effectively mitgated through site-specific strategies, supporting the use of prescribed fires as as a safe and practical management tool. To this end, we developed an adaptive framework that guides prescribed burning by balancing its ecological and hydrological benefits against potenital risks, thereby promoting sustainable forest management, reducing wildfire risk, and protecting water resources."

Conservation of these ecosystems is vital in preventing the return of massive amounts of carbon to the atmosphere. With climate boundaries of ecosystems shifting, choosing to restore wisely has never been more important. We set out to assess how climate boundaries of peatlands in Europe may shift with climate by (1) deriving relationships between peatland distributions and climate variables and (2) using these relationships to project peatland distributions into the future based on two climate change scenarios: one scenario in line with the Paris Agreement (SSP1-2.6) and a scenario predicting 3 °C warming by 2050 (SSP5-8.5). We estimate that 93% of European peat soils do not longer have functioning peatland ecosystems. The climate conditions for the remaining 7% of peatlands may remain best in Northern Scandinavia, the Western islands, and higher elevations within the European mainland. In contrast, climate suitability for peatlands will significantly decrease through most of Southern, Central, and Eastern Europe. Under 3 °C warming, 92% of all currently functional peatlands will face less suitable climate conditions by 2050. Moreover, the proportion of peatlands under unfavorable climatic conditions will almost triple from 6% to 15%. Our findings imply that conservation and restoration of peatlands in future climates will be most effective in areas with peatlands that are likely to remain closer to the center of their climate niche including parts of northern Scandinavia, Ireland, Scotland and at higher elevational ranges."

Enhanced rock weathering (ERW) captures CO2 by forming dissolved bicarbonate. In addition to CDR, both methods may offer soil improvement as a co-benefit. However, their interaction and combined CDR potential remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate their individual and combined effects on carbon dynamics in a temperate agricultural soil. Using the process-based LiDELSv2 model calibrated against data from the lysimeter experiment, we simulate 1000 year impacts of applying 4.2 wt% wood biochar, 2 wt% basanite rock powder (RP), their co-application, and co-pyrolyzed material (rock-enhanced biochar, RE-biochar) on soil organic carbon (SOC), net primary production (NPP), net CO2 ecosystem exchange (NEE), and calcium (Ca2+) leaching in a northern German sandy soil. Biochar alone led to the highest increase in SOC and achieved a modeled NEE of −200 g C ha−1 yr−1 per ton of biochar throughout 1000 years, acting as a long-term carbon sink. Co-application and RE-biochar increased SOC too, but to a lesser extent. Rock powder alone reduced SOC by 7%. Although RP enhanced Ca2+ leaching, this did not result in net CO2 removal. Ecosystem respiration and NPP remained stable in the long term. Our results suggest that, when accounting for assumed application rates, biochar is the primary driver of long-term soil-based CDR, while ERW provides only minor co-benefits. This highlights the need to tailor interventions to specific soil and climate conditions."

The analysis highlights the long-term aerosol characteristics and separates natural (dust) and anthropogenic (non-dust) contributions. Emission control policies were highly effective during 2010–2017. However, since 2018, lidar-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) ceased decreasing and fluctuated, and the decline in PM2.5 concentration also became slower, possibly due to atmospheric chemistry factors. 
 Air quality in China has improved significantly over the past decade. However, recent studies show that this progress has notably slowed in recent years. To investigate regional patterns and driving factors, we examined the long-term evolution of tropospheric aerosols over Wuhan (30.5° N, 114.4° E) from 2010 to 2024, using ground-based polarization lidar observations. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) trends are divided into two phases: a declining trend (−0.077 yr−1) during 2010–2017 (Stage I) and a fluctuating period during 2018–2024 (Stage II). Contributions from natural (dust) and anthropogenic (non-dust) aerosols were analyzed separately. Dust optical depth (DOD) consistently declined (−0.011 yr−1) until August 2020 and became larger again afterwards. In Stage I, anthropogenic aerosols (−0.068 yr−1) were responsible for 88.3 % of the total AOD reduction, primarily due to decreases in boundary-layer AOD. In Stage II, anthropogenic AOD fluctuated, possibly due to atmospheric chemistry and meteorological factors. Seasonal variations were also observed. Anthropogenic aerosols appeared from the surface to 2.5 km in summer, with particle extinction and mass concentration of 0.12 km−1 and 83.0 µg m−3, which were concentrated below 0.7 km in winter, with much higher particle extinction and mass concentration of 0.31 km−1 and 211.8 µg m−3. Two case studies highlighted typical pollution events: summertime transboundary agricultural biomass burning smoke in June 2014 and wintertime local anthropogenic aerosol pollution in January 2019. These findings improve our understanding of how regional aerosols respond to local emission controls and long-range transport of dust and smoke."

Organic molecular species exhibited distinct seasonal variabilities and were more abundant and chemically diverse in winter. Anthropogenic pollution played key roles in altering their composition and related properties under various conditions. 
 Biogenic organic aerosols interacting with anthropogenic pollutants lead to large uncertainties in aerosol properties and impacts, yet the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. To explore the anthropogenic–biogenic interactions in the Qinling Mountains region of central China, we investigated the molecular composition of organic aerosols in atmospheric PM2.5 at a forest site in summer and winter of 2021/2022, using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled with Orbitrap mass spectrometry. Organic species were more abundant and chemically diverse in winter compared with those in summer, as revealed by their higher numbers and peak area intensities. The molecular characteristics of organic species exhibited distinct seasonal variabilities, with higher peak-area-weighted mean values of molecular weight and oxidation state but lower unsaturation degree in summer, possibly associated with more biogenic emissions and intense photochemical processes. A variety of organic tracer species were identified in the two seasons, among which the biogenic ones were relatively more abundant in summer, contrasting with the substantial increase of anthropogenic ones in winter. A higher ambient relative humidity, except for heavy precipitation, usually promoted the production of nitrogen- and sulfur-containing organic species by involving more anthropogenic pollutants. The synergistic effects of meteorology and anthropogenic pollution greatly affected the organic aerosol production in this forest atmosphere, thereby altering their molecular composition and related properties under different environmental conditions. The combined set of results herein provides direct evidence for the anthropogenic perturbations on air quality, atmospheric chemistry, and associated climate impacts in the Qinling Mountains region."

Haskins,The global importance of gas-phase peroxy radical accretion reactions for secondary organic aerosol loading,"This work outlines an investigation into an understudied atmospheric chemical reaction pathway with the potential to form particulate pollution that has important impacts on air quality and climate. It suggests that this chemical pathway is responsible for a large fraction of the atmospheric particulate matter observed in tropical forested regions, but also highlights the need for further ambient and lab investigations to inform an accurate representation of this process in atmospheric models. 
 Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is an important class of atmospheric species with influences on air quality and climate. One understudied SOA formation pathway is gas-phase peroxy radical (RO2) accretion reactions, where two peroxy radicals combine to form a dimer species. This work makes use of recent advances in the theoretical understanding of RO2 accretion reactions to assess their contribution to SOA. After evaluation in a chemical box model, a reduced representation of RO2 accretion reactions was added to a global chemical transport model (GEOS -Chem) to assess the contribution to global SOA and the associated radiative impact. The results of this work suggest that RO2 accretion products may comprise 30 %–50 % of particulate matter (PM2.5) in tropical forested environments, and a smaller proportion in more temperate regions like the south-eastern USA (≈5 %). This work suggests that biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) are the main precursors to accretion products globally, but that a notable fraction of aerosol-phase accretion products come from aromatic-derived RO2 and small acyl-peroxy radicals. Contrary to previous assumptions that accretion products are organic peroxides, the box modelling investigations suggest that non-peroxide accretion products (ethers and esters) could comprise the majority of accretion products in both the gas and aerosol phase. This work provides justification for more extensive measurements of RO2 accretion reactions in laboratory experiments and RO2 accretion products in the ambient atmosphere in order to better constrain the representation of this chemistry in atmospheric models, including a greater level of mechanistic chemical representation of SOA formation processes."

We find that the chemical environment and resulting ozone production within smoke changes as plumes evolve, with implications for climate and public health. 
 Tropospheric ozone (O3) production from wildfires is highly uncertain; previous studies have identified both production and loss of O3 in fire-influenced air masses. To capture the total ozone production attributable to a smoke plume, we bridge the gap between near-field fire plume chemistry and aged smoke in the remote troposphere. Using airborne measurements from several major campaigns, we find that fire-ozone production increases with age, with a regime transition from NOx-saturated to NOx-limited conditions, showing that O3 production in well-aged plumes is largely controlled by nitrogen oxides (NOx). Observations in fresh smoke demonstrate that suppressed photochemistry reduces O3 production by ∼ 70 % in units of ppb Ox (O3 + NO2) per ppm CO in the near-field (age < 20 h). We demonstrate that anthropogenic NOx injection into VOC-rich fire plumes drives additional O3 production, sometimes exceeding 50 ppb above background. Using a box model, we explore the evolving sensitivity of O3 production to fire emissions and chemical parameters. We demonstrate the importance of aerosol-induced photochemical suppression over heterogeneous HO2 uptake, validate HONO's importance as an oxidant precursor, and confirm evolving NOx sensitivity. We evaluate GEOS-Chem's performance against these observations, finding the model captures fire-induced O3 enhancements at older ages but overestimates near-field enhancements, fails to capture the magnitude and variability of fire emissions, and does not capture the chemical regime transition. These discrepancies drive biases in normalized ozone production (ΔO3/ΔCO) across plume lifetime, though the model generally captures observed absolute O3 enhancements in fire plumes. GEOS-Chem attributes 2.4 % of the global tropospheric ozone burden and 3.1 % of surface ozone concentrations to fire emissions in 2020, with stronger impacts in regions of frequent burning."

We conclude that atmospheric chemical processing, in which aerosol liquid water and acidity play vital roles, dictates aerosol aluminium solubility. 
 Deposition of mineral dust aerosol into open oceans impacts marine biogeochemistry, and the deposition flux can be constrained using dissolved aluminum (Al) in surface seawater as a tracer. However, aerosol Al solubility, a critical parameter used in this method, remains highly uncertain. We investigated seasonal variations of Al solubility for supermicron and submicron particles at two locations in Northern China. Aerosol Al solubility was very low at Xi'an (0.11 %–9.1 %), showed no apparent variation with seasons or relative humidity, and was not correlated with sulfate or nitrate; in contrast, it was much higher at Qingdao (0.06 %–23.4 %), exhibited distinct seasonal variability, and increased with relative humidity and the abundance of sulfate and nitrate. All these features observed can be explained by the effects of atmospheric chemical processing. Mineral dust transported to Xi'an, an inland city in Northwest China, was still not obviously aged and thus chemical processing had little effect on Al solubility; after arriving at Qingdao, a coastal city in the Northwest Pacific, mineral dust was substantially aged by chemical processing, leading to significant enhancement in Al solubility. Our work further reveals that aerosol liquid water and acidity play vital roles in the dissolution of aerosol Al by chemical processing. We suggest that chemical aging can lead to spatiotemporal variation of aerosol Al solubility, and this should be considered when using dissolved Al in surface seawater to constrain oceanic dust deposition."

Our results also show that oxygenated organic molecules can make a great contribution to the initial growth of freshly nucleated particles in the real atmosphere. 
 As a major source of cloud condensation nuclei, atmospheric new particle formation (NPF) events exert significant influences on the global climate. Among nucleation mechanisms identified in diverse environments, sulfuric acid-amine nucleation is unique for its high efficiency in forming stable clusters and driving intense nucleation. Despite the fact that this nucleation mechanism can explain observed NPF events at individual sites, its applicability to a larger regional scale remains unclear. Here, we analyze the mechanism and influencing factors of NPF at several sites in the eastern region of China, using measured and theoretically predicted particle formation rates and cluster concentrations. Results show that sulfuric acid and dimethylamine can explain the observed atmospheric nucleation and atmospheric conditions including precursor concentrations and temperature cause the differences in NPF characteristics among sites.

Heatwave results: canopy heat island was 91.3 % stronger day/52.7 % night. Day heat relied on building coverage, night on sky visibility. Tall buildings block sun by day, trap heat at night. Night ventilation cools, day winds spread heat. Urban design must consider day-night cycles to fight extreme heat, guiding risk reduction. 
 Currently, the diurnal asymmetric and nonlinear mechanisms by which urban morphology modulates the canopy urban heat island (CUHI) during heat wave (HW) periods remain underexplored. This study aims to fill this gap by focusing on the area within the Fifth Ring Road of Beijing, integrating three complementary methods: XGBoost (to identify key morphological drivers), ENVI-met (to reveal nonlinear regulatory processes), and wind environment analysis (to supplement dynamic modulation). The results show that: (1) HW periods significantly enhance CUHI intensity (CUHII) compared to non-heat wave (NHW) periods, with a 91.3 % increase in daytime and 52.7 % at night; (2) XGBoost identifies building coverage ratio (BCR) as the core daytime driver of CUHII, while sky view factor (SVF) dominates at night, and both 2D and 3D morphological indicators exert stronger effects during HW periods; (3) ENVI-met simulations reveal nonlinear mechanisms of building height/SVF: daytime thermal environments are co-driven by short-wave radiation shading and ventilation resistance (as SVF decreases), while nighttime environments are dominated by long-wave radiation accumulation by buildings; (4) Wind environment analysis further shows diurnal differences in wind's role: nighttime ventilation corridors mitigate CUHII by 33.91 %–42.09 %, while daytime prevailing winds may exacerbate downstream CUHII via thermal advection. These findings clarify the diurnal asymmetric mechanisms of CUHI and provide scientific support for urban morphological optimization under extreme heat."

We show that during early spring systematic errors are present in these data that are correlated to the presence of the polar vortex. These errors occur due to the usage of wrong methane prior shapes in the retrieval and can be alleviated by modifying the prior shape accordingly. 
 Trace gas measurements from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) are important for monitoring the global climate system and for validating satellite measurements. In the Arctic, ground-based data coverage is relatively limited due the inherent challenges of conducting measurements in this region (e.g., remoteness, harsh weather). Additionally, solar absorption measurements require sunlight and are not possible during polar night. TCCON measurements from the Arctic sites are of significant value for the validation of satellite data products in this region, as these measurements can extend the spatiotemporal coverage in the Arctic. In this study, we investigate the TCCON methane (CH4) retrieval under polar vortex conditions. The CH4 profile exhibits a distinct shape inside the vortex, which is related to the descent of stratospheric air inside the vortex. We show that the standard TCCON CH4 prior does not sufficiently reproduce this profile shape, leading to air mass dependencies (AMDs), increased spectral residuals, and less sensitive averaging kernels. These effects can be explained by the imperfect vertical sensitivity, especially to the stratosphere. We further show that changes in the prior can improve the retrieval within the polar vortex. This leads to mean differences between 1 and 2 ppb in XCH4 compared to the standard retrieval, as well as maximum differences up to roughly 17 ppb. This paper highlights the importance of understanding the limitations of retrieval methods to avoid misinterpretation of data. Furthermore, it emphasizes the need to investigate the shape of trace gas profiles inside the polar vortex to improve profile-scaling retrievals (PSRs) in the Arctic, which could include in situ data campaigns focusing on inside-vortex air."

To better understand this, we developed a new instrument that measures how air particles may cause such effects in near real time. Unlike current methods that may miss key signals, our system captures and analyzes air more efficiently and continuously. Our results show it works reliably, offering a promising new tool to monitor pollution’s health impacts more accurately. 
 Particulate Matter (PM) and gaseous pollutants can carry or induce the production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in the lung environment, causing oxidative stress, a key factor in the development of cardiovascular and pulmonary outcomes. Over the past decade, numerous techniques have been implemented to assess the Oxidative Potential (OP) of aerosols, i.e., their ability to oxidise the lung environment as an initial proxy of subsequent biological processes. Offline measurements from filters collected from air samplers are widely assessed but are probably underestimating PM redox activity due to the short lifetime of several ROS and/or the loss of the most volatile compounds on filters in a non-proportional and unsystematic way. This study introduces a new device, called ROS-Online, allowing the automatic and near real time measurement of two complementary OP assays, OP Ascorbic Acid (OPAA) and OP Dithiothreitol (OPDTT), sensitive to ambient PMs at mass concentrations about [PM10] ∼ 20 µg m−3. The ROS-Online device is designed to reproduce the exposure and interaction of airborne particles with the respiratory system. ROS-Online consists of three main modules: (i) an air sampling module using a BioSampler® to collect airborne PM, (ii) a distribution module that transports samples and reagents to (iii) a measurement module that relies on spectrophotometric methods to monitor chemical reactions in real time. Its operation is based on established OPAA and OPDTT protocols, ensuring comparability with existing offline OP measurement methods. Compact and transportable (75 × 65 × 170 cm, 85 kg), ROS-Online is designed for deployment in air quality monitoring stations and allows for autonomous operation over 2 weeks. With a high particle collection efficiency (> 90 % by mass for PM1 and PM2.5) and greater sensitivity than offline methods, it provides accurate and reliable results across a wide range of aerosol concentrations, from urban backgrounds to highly polluted environments. The qualification of the device demonstrated an excellent correlation with offline methods for both OPAA and OPDTT measurements (r > 0.96), over positive controls, confirming the reliability and specificity of ROS-Online for continuous atmospheric aerosol OP monitoring. ROS-Online was deployed in the field, in an urban background site, where OPAA of ambient air was measured for 15 continuous days and OPDTT for 6 continuous days. Results showed a good correlation with ozone (O3) signal (R2 = 0.74), underlying the importance of considering pollutants' interaction in OP measurements, as laboratory experiment showed no OP response when introducing O3 alone into the instrument. Comparison of ROS-Online measurements with established offline methods showed an excellent correlation for both AA and DTT assays (r > 0.96), supporting its reliability for atmospheric monitoring. These preliminary results mark an important step towards establishing ROS-Online as a viable and effective tool for OP assessment in future research and monitoring endeavours."

By accumulating ions in a trap prior the TOF mass analyzer, we achieve a limit of detection in the 10-3 to 10-6 ppq range with temporal resolutions in the order of 1 s to 10 min, respectively. This makes it highly relevant for atmospheric measurements, as it enables probing short-lived, low-concentration species of high importance in atmospheric chemistry and new particle formation. 
 We have characterised a new Atmospheric-Pressure-interface Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer, equipped with an octapole ion trap for accumulating the sampled ions before orthogonally accelerating them into the mass analyser. The characterisation has been carried out using ion standards produced by electrospray ionisation, that were subsequently mobility-selected by a differential mobility analyser operated at atmospheric pressure. Our results show that the detection sensitivity (or limit of detection) of the mass spectrometer is in the parts per quintillion (i.e., 10−3 parts per quadrillion, ppq; which is ∼ 30 ions cm−3) range with temporal resolutions of 1 s. When increasing the temporal resolution up to 1 min, the detection sensitivity can be reduced to the 10 parts per sextillion (i.e., 10−5 ppq; which is ∼ 0.3 ions cm−3) range, enabling the system to measure gaseous ions of extremely low concentrations. In contrast to other mass spectrometers that employ spectra accumulation to improve the detection sensitivity for atmospheric observations, ion accumulation amplifies the signal without increasing the noise level; something that among others is highly important for probing short-lived ionic clusters during new particle formation events in the atmospheric environment. We also show that the mass spectrometer has a transmission of up to 1 %, and a mass resolution of 23 000 for ionic masses of ca. 600 Da, while it can be used in ways to induce collision dissociation of the sampled ions by tuning the operating conditions of the Atmospheric-Pressure-interface stage."

Mahecha;Fabian Gans,Dheed: an ERA5 based global database of compound dry and hot extreme events from 1950 to 2023,"The impacts of climate extremes such as heatwaves and droughts can be made worse when they happen at the same time. Dheed is a global database of dry and hot compound extreme events from 1950 to 2023. It can be combined with other data to study the impacts of those events on terrestrial ecosystems, specific species or human societies. Dheed's analysis confirms that extremely dry and hot days have become more common on all continents in recent decades, especially in Europe and Africa. 
 The intensification of climate extremes is one of the most immediate effects of global climate change. Heatwaves and droughts have uneven impacts on ecosystems that can be exacerbated in case of compound events. To comprehensively study these events, e.g. with local high-resolution remote sensing or in-situ data, a global catalogue of compound dry and hot (CDH) events is essential. Here, we propose a database of large-scale dry and hot extreme events based on ERA5 climate reanalysis data. Drought indicators are constructed based on the daily balance between reference evapotranspiration and precipitation averaged over the previous 30, 90 and 180 d. Extreme events are detected with absolute local thresholds for the 1950–2023 period. CDH extremes are defined as daily maximum temperature at 2 m exceeding a 99 % absolute local threshold based on the empirical probability distribution, combined with any of the three drought indicators falling short of the 1 % threshold. Unique labels are assigned to CDH events lasting at least three days using a connected component analysis.  Their spatiotemporal extent and summary statistics are extracted for all labelled events. The identified CDH events are validated against extreme events reported in the literature. Out of 40 events listed a priori, 38 could be associated with labelled CDH events. All 10 largest and 10 longest labelled CDH events could be linked to droughts and/or heatwaves reported in the scientific or grey literature.

Compared to the 10 m product, the sub-meter map achieved a 14.60% increase in overall accuracy, revealed a 57.73% discrepancy in spatial distribution, and detected 17 times more individual patches. The improved sensitivity to small patches significantly enhances early detection of Spartina alterniflora invasion. This finer mapping further refines soil carbon estimates and informs wetland management. 
 Current large-scale maps of Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) with 10 m resolution hinder accurate delineation of community boundaries, detection of internal features such as creeks, and identification of small patches. These limitations further compromise the accuracy of spatial distribution extraction and subsequent analyzes. To this end, this study produced the first 2020 national-scale Sub-meter (0.9 m) S. alterniflora Map of Mainland China (CM-SSM), using an object- and sub-meter-enhanced pixel-based phenological feature composite method. The method integrates phenological features from Sentinel-2 with spatial and texture details from Google Earth imagery, improving the spectral separability and mitigating mixed-pixel effects. Compared to the 10 m S. alterniflora product of Mainland China (CMSA), CM-SSM improved overall accuracy by 14.60 % and the F1 score by 0.24. Although the total mapped areas of CM-SSM (59 371 ha) and CMSA (58 006 ha) differ by only 1365 ha, their spatial distributions diverge substantially. When benchmarked against CM-SSM, CMSA exhibited commission and omission errors totaling 34 273 ha (57.73 %). Moreover, the number of patches identified by CM-SSM (148 072) was over 17 times greater than that of CMSA, reflecting its superior capability in detecting fragmented distributions. In addition, Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) estimates derived from CM-SSM were 706.69 Gg (23.09 %) higher than those reported by the corresponding national SOC product for the same year, emphasizing the essential contribution of high-resolution mapping to accurate carbon accounting for S. alterniflora. These advances enhance understanding of S. alterniflora invasion dynamics, support carbon accounting, and inform evidence-based coastal wetland management and restoration.

We developed a combined GOME-2 SIF record (2007–2023) from GOME-2A and GOME-2B SIF using the SIFTER v3 algorithm, which corrects these artefacts. Both records show strong spatial and temporal coherence. A framework is provided to detect and, if needed, correct intersensor offsets, supporting consistent long-term monitoring of vegetation dynamics. 
 Design differences in sensors and retrieval algorithms complicate the harmonisation of space-based solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) observations. The GOME-2 series, with its identical sensor design, offers potential for constructing a long-term coherent record. However, instrumental artefacts, such as degradation, affect the sensors differently and diverge the intersensor SIF observations. Achieving internal consistency within each record is therefore a critical first step in harmonisation. We present a combined GOME-2 SIF dataset for 2007–2023 that consists of GOME-2A (Jan. 2007–Dec. 2017) and GOME-2B SIF (July 2013–Dec. 2023) data. Both individual records are retrieved using the previously developed SIFTER v3 algorithm, which applies time-, wavelength-, and scan-angle-dependent degradation corrections. Spatial agreement between GOME-2A and GOME-2B SIF during the overlapping period was strong (r ≥ 0.96), although viewing geometry differences caused substantial systematic biases, specifically over high activity regions; these were reduced to within 2 % by constraining to common viewing zenith angle ranges. In terms of temporal alignment, most analysed regions showed no significant step change at the July 2013 sensor transition, from full-swath GOME-2A to GOME-2B SIF. Small offsets in Eastern China and the Amazon were corrected for using a simple additive correction, which improved the coherence and agreement with independent GPP estimations from FluxSat. Finally, the GOME-2 records align closely with FluxSat GPP and TROPOMI SIF across various biomes, and support monitoring of vegetation activity over 17 years. Our work presents a framework for detecting and, when necessary, correcting intersensor offset biases, enabling the use of GOME-2A and GOME-2B SIF as a single record.

To enable computationally efficient modeling approaches that can account for potentially unknown subsurface properties, we present a surrogate modeling technique. This technique combines physics-based and machine-learning techniques to enable reliable predictions of geodynamical applications, as we illustrate for the case study of the Alpine Region. 
 Geodynamical processes are important to understand and assess the evolution of the Earth system as well as its natural resources. Given the wide range of characteristic spatial and temporal scales of geodynamic processes, their analysis routinely relies on computer-assisted numerical simulations. To provide reliable predictions such simulations need to consider a wide range of potential input parameters, material properties as they vary in space and time, in order to address associated uncertainties. To obtain any quantifiable measure of these uncertainties is challenging both because of the high computational cost of the forward simulation and because data is typically limited to direct observations at the near surface and for the present-day state. To account for both of these challenges, we present how to construct efficient and reliable surrogate models that are applicable to a wide range of geodynamic problems using a physics-based machine learning method. In this study, we apply our approach to the case study of the Alpine region, as a natural example for a complex geodynamic setting where several subduction slabs as imaged by tomographic methods interact below a heterogeneous lithosphere. We specifically develop surrogates for two sets of observables, topography and surface velocity, to provide models that can be used in probabilistic frameworks to validate the underlying model structure and parametrization. We additionally construct models for the deeper crustal and mantle domains of the model, to improve the system understanding. For this last family of models, we highlight different construction methods to develop models to either allow evaluations in the entirety of the 3D model or only at specific depth intervals."

This helps scientists estimate how easily these compounds evaporate, which is important for understanding air pollution and climate. We tested the program using real-world data and found it to be highly accurate. Our work makes it faster and easier to study the behavior of many complex chemicals in the atmosphere. 
 Volatile organic compounds play a significant role in atmospheric chemistry, influencing air quality and climate change. Accurate prediction of their physical properties is essential for understanding their behavior. This paper introduces VaPOrS (Vapor Pressure in Organics via SMILES) as a comprehensive tool designed to process SMILES notation of organic compounds, identify key functional groups, and apply group-contribution methods for property estimation. The core innovation of VaPOrS lies in its self-contained functional group recognition algorithm, which eliminates dependence on external cheminformatics libraries. The current approach enables fully auditable, easily modifiable, and computationally efficient detection of 30 functional groups required by the SIMPOL method. Compared to existing tools, VaPOrS avoids heavy SMILES-to-graph conversions and can obviate interface overhead, providing orders-of-magnitude speedups for large-scale atmospheric modeling scenarios. While this first implementation focuses on the SIMPOL method for estimating saturation vapor pressure and enthalpy of vaporization, the framework is readily extendable to other group-contribution schemes and thermodynamic properties (e.g., partition coefficients, volatility basis set models, solubility, Henry's law constants). The tool has been validated against manually counted functional groups and experimental saturation vapor pressure data for a diverse set of compounds. Results demonstrate excellent agreement with both the original SIMPOL model and experimental observations, while comparisons with existing tools highlight the robustness and accuracy of the new parsing functions. VaPOrS thus provides a generalizable and computationally efficient platform for property prediction of large molecular datasets, facilitating integration into chemical transport and climate models and streamlining the analysis of thousands of organic compounds in atmospheric science applications."

 With rising global temperatures, urban environments are increasingly vulnerable to heat stress, often exacerbated by the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. While most UHI research has focused on large metropolitan areas around the world, relatively smaller-sized cities (with a population 100 000–300 000) remain understudied despite their growing exposure to extreme heat and meteorological significance. In particular, urban heat advection (UHA), the transport of heat by mean winds, remains a key but underexplored mechanism in most modeling frameworks. High-resolution numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are essential tools for simulating urban hydrometeorological conditions, yet most prior evaluations have focused on retrospective reanalysis products rather than forecasts. In this study, we assess the performance of a widely used operational weather forecast model, the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), as a representative example of current NWP systems. We investigate its ability to predict spatial and temporal patterns of urban heat and UHA within and around Lubbock, Texas, a small-sized city located in a semi-arid environment in the southwestern US. Using data collected between 1 September 2023, and 31 August 2024 from the Urban Heat Island Experiment in Lubbock, Texas (U-HEAT) network and five West Texas Mesonet stations, we compare 18 h forecasts against in situ observations. HRRR forecasts exhibit a consistent nighttime cold bias at both urban and rural sites, a daytime warm bias at rural locations, and a pervasive dry bias across all seasons. The model also systematically overestimates near-surface wind speeds, further limiting its ability to accurately predict UHA. Although HRRR captures the expected slower nocturnal cooling in urban areas, it does not well capture advective heat transport under most wind regimes. Our findings reveal both systematic biases and urban representation limitations in current high-resolution NWP forecasts. Our forecast–observation comparisons underscore the need for improved urban parameterizations and evaluation frameworks focused on forecast skill, with important implications for heat-risk warning systems and forecasting in small and mid-sized cities."

These materials can behave like both solids and fluids, making their modeling difficult. Matter addresses this with a unified framework, using a numerical solver called MPM. Able to capture cohesion, density variations and complex terrains, it's particularly relevant for snow avalanches or landslides. Matter runs efficiently on standard computers, making advanced simulations more accessible. 
 Simulating the mechanics and flow of granular media requires numerical methods that can handle extreme deformations, along with accurate constitutive models capable of capturing phenomena such as elasticity, shear banding, viscous behavior, compressibility, intergranular attractive forces and rate-dependent friction. In pursuit of this, this article introduces Matter, a Material Point Method (MPM) solver equipped with a range of models to describe dry and cohesive granular media. Rooted in a finite strain elastoplastic framework with a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient, this solver features Drucker-Prager models, overstress models, critical state mechanics models as well as the μ(I)-rheology. This includes the recently proposed “critical state μ(I)-rheology model” for cohesive and compressible flows. Moreover, Matter provides a simple way of dealing with complex terrains and introduces a novel material-induced frictional boundary condition. Implemented in C++ with few required dependencies and parallelized on shared memory, it represents a lightweight yet computationally efficient option for laptops and desktops."

 Outlet glaciers and ice streams of the ice sheet of Kalaallit Nunaat (Greenland) transport ice from the interior towards the ocean, so understanding their dynamics is crucial in the context of accelerating Arctic warming. Glacier flow dynamics are predominantly monitored by satellites, thus important processes that occur on timescales shorter than the acquisition frequency (typically days) remain undetected. Therefore, the short-term dynamics of fast-flowing glaciers remains poorly understood and insufficiently constrained in numerical models. Here we use high-rate field observations by global navigation satellite system stations and a Terrestrial Radar Interferometer on Greenland’s fastest ice stream, Sermeq Kujalleq in Kangia (Jakobshavn Isbræ), to characterize its response to the drainage of two surface lakes. The ensuing subglacial flood caused a pulse of faster flow that rapidly propagated downstream—over 16 km within 4 hours—towards the terminus, where it triggered a longer than usual calving episode, lasting 2 hours. The undamped and fast propagation of this speed-up pulse, together with the instantaneous response of the surrounding shear margins, indicate strong coupling within the ice-stream system. Our results highlight how inland areas can accommodate large disturbances with minimal long-term impact on ice motion and efficiently propagate them downstream to trigger irreversible changes at glacier termini.

Here, the authors found that epigenetic monoallelic expression is regulated in early embryos by two conserved maternal histone methyltransferases. 
 Undefined epigenetic programs act to probabilistically silence individual autosomal alleles, generating unique individuals, even from genetic clones. This random monoallelic expression can explain variation in traits and diseases that differences in genes and environments cannot. Here, we developed the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to study monoallelic expression in whole tissues, and defined a developmental genetic regulation pathway. We found maternal H3K9 histone methyltransferase (HMT) SET-25/SUV39/G9a works with HPL-2/HP1 and LIN-61/L3MBTL2 to randomly silence alleles in the intestinal progenitor E-cell of 8-cell embryos to cause monoallelic expression. SET-25 was antagonized by another maternal H3K9 HMT, MET-2/SETDB1, which works with LIN-65/ATF7IP and ARLE-14/ARL14EP to prevent monoallelic expression. The HMT catalytic SET domains of both MET-2 and SET-25 were required for regulating monoallelic expression. Our data support a model wherein SET-25 and MET-2 regulate histones during development to generate patterns of somatic monoallelic expression that are persistent but not heritable.

A peptide gel that traps 4-GBA restores jawbone healing in rats, rabbits and dogs, suggesting a local, immune-sparing therapy. 
 Hyperglycemia impairs stem cell–mediated bone regeneration, yet the responsible immunometabolic block remains undefined. We identify a neutrophil–Pad4–metabolite axis that suppresses osteogenesis. In rat models of chronic and intermittent hyperglycemia, neutrophils activate ERK/JNK–AP‑1, upregulate Pad4, and generate 4‑guanidinobutyric acid (4‑GBA). 4‑GBA binds alkaline phosphatase (ALP) on jawbone mesenchymal stem cells (JBMSCs), inhibits ALP, and reduces mineralization. Padi4 deletion accelerates socket healing under hyperglycemia. To restore osteogenesis, we engineer GBASpongel, a peptide hydrogel that captures 4‑GBA at the defect. Local GBASpongel treatment rescues ALP activity, osteogenic gene expression, and bone formation in hyperglycemic rats, and improves jawbone regeneration in hyperglycemic rabbits and beagle dogs. Binding assays show micromolar affinity between 4‑GBA and ALP. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses corroborate pathway activation and rescue. Neutrophil-derived 4-GBA directly links hyperglycemia to impaired JBMSC function, and locally targeting this metabolite provides a translational approach to restore bone healing in dysglycemia. Here they show that high blood sugar drives neutrophils to release 4-GBA, a Pad4 byproduct that blocks bone-forming stem cells.

Topham,Kinetically controlled hetero-fusion is a systems-level behaviour of polymer nanoparticle populations,"Particle fusion is a promising process for constructing nanomaterials, but challenging to control in synthetic systems. Here, the authors report a method for kinetically regulated particle fusion controlled by variation in polymer chain length. 
 Particle fusion is key for establishing communication between biological components. For this reason, whole cell fusion plays a crucial role in many processes, including infection, muscle formation and tissue repair. Analogous co-assembly between synthetic nanoparticles represents a similar type of communication mechanism in artificial systems. Other approaches to control such co-assembly rely on incorporating anisotropic recognition units onto particle surfaces to provide a thermodynamic driving force. Here we present a fundamentally different approach, where hetero-fusion between two populations of undecorated polymer nanoparticles is regulated using kinetic control. Fusion extent is tuned simply by adjusting polymer chain length. Fusion is probed using an elemental tagging strategy for cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with electron energy loss spectroscopy (cryo-STEM-EELS). Our results demonstrate the emergence of a complex process between populations of synthetic nanoparticles akin to communication. We anticipate such systems-level behaviour that results from hetero-fusion can enable future technologies. Particle fusion is a promising process for constructing nanomaterials, but challenging to control in synthetic systems.

These authors characterize a nematode homolog of such human receptors, presenting the cryo-EM structure of an asymmetric dimer that embodies properties of the human receptors. 
 Glycoprotein hormones (GpHs) produced in the human pituitary act through receptors (GpHRs) in the gonads to support reproduction and in the thyroid for metabolism. GpHs are heterodimeric cystine-knot proteins; their receptors bind cognate hormones at an extracellular domain and signal through a transmembrane domain to heterotrimeric G proteins. GpHs and GpHRs have co-evolved from invertebrate counterparts. Structures of the human receptors as isolated for cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) are all monomeric despite compelling evidence for their functioning as dimers. Here we characterize the homologous receptor from Caenorhabditis elegans. Its biochemical properties are notably similar to those of the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) of humans. Structurally, it is an asymmetric dimer (protomers screw-transformed by 142°/4.1 Å), composed such that only one hormone could bind. This is compatible with the 1:2 asymmetry of negatively cooperative TSH:TSHR complexes and for the transactivation evident from functional complementation of binding-deficient and signaling-deficient GpHRs. By modeling, a symmetrized dimer can bind two hormones as in the 2:2 complexes that support TSHR switches in G-protein usage.

Here, the authors show that Piezo1-driven YAP–CCN1/2 signalling is essential for osteocyte maturation and dendrite formation. 
 Mechanical force controls bone development and homeostasis, with mechanosensitive osteocytes playing a key role. Osteocytes form interconnected dendrites to respond to mechanical stimuli and regulate bone formation and resorption. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying osteocyte maturation and dendrite formation remain elusive. Here we show that Piezo1 loss in late osteoblasts and osteocytes reduces bone mass and disrupts osteocyte differentiation with reduced dendrite number, length and network formation. Decreased YAP activity and unexpected Wnt/β-catenin signaling activation cause these deficiencies, largely restored by intermittent YAP activation. We further identify YAP targets CCN1/2 as crucial secreted factors in the Piezo1-YAP mechanotransduction. CCN1/2 overexpression in the liver rescues dendritic and bone defects in the Piezo1 mutant mice by activating Src, promoting actin polymerization, and activating YAP in a positive feedforward loop. Our findings highlight the pivotal roles of Piezo1 and YAP-CCN1/2-Src signaling, offering potential therapeutic targets for improving osteocyte dendritic networks.

The derived ZnMgO shows ultraviolet photoresponse for photodetection. 
 Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous crystalline materials whose composition and structure can be tuned for catalysis, sensing, and optoelectronic applications. Incorporating two different metal ions into a single framework can broaden the functionalities of MOFs. However, conventional solvothermal synthesis typically requires high temperature and long reaction times, while electrochemical anodic dissolution is limited by solid anodes that can only supply a single metal source. For active metals such as Mg, the rapid formation of a passivation layer on solid anodes hinders the continuous release of metal ions. Here, we introduce a liquid metal interface-controlled electrochemical strategy using a fluid Mg-Ga alloy anode, overcoming the single-metal limitation of conventional anodic deposition. The self-healing surface of liquid gallium and its high surface tension induce electrocapillarity and Marangoni flow under an applied bias, enabling dynamic and spatially uniform release of Mg²⁺ ions that co-assemble precisely with Zn²⁺ from solution. Under an optimized bias of 0.3 V, the resulting bimetallic ZnMg-MOF-74 exhibits high crystallinity, nanosheet morphology, and uniform metal distribution. The ZnMgO oxide derived from a two-step annealing process shows excellent ultraviolet photodetection performance, with a responsivity of 1.48 A/W and a fast rise time of 0.32 s. This substrate-free and composition-controllable platform highlights a strategy for interface-driven synthesis of multimetallic MOFs and their derivatives for sensing and optoelectronic applications.

 XPD is a key nucleotide excision repair (NER) protein whose function is vital for genome integrity. During NER, XPD serves as a 5′−3′ single-strand DNA translocase that enables lesion scanning and verification in genomic DNA. Yet, its translocation mechanism is incompletely understood. Here we use molecular simulations and chain-of-replicas path optimization methods to model the ATP-driven translocation mechanisms of XPD and its bacterial homolog DinG, revealing all on-path metastable intermediates and corresponding kinetic rates. We identify the XPD(DinG) global domain motions that modulate the strength of DNA association at the opposing ends of the DNA-binding groove. During the ATP hydrolysis cycle, alternating weak and strong interactions at two defined groove constrictions enable DNA reptation and forward displacement of the ATPase. Moreover, we show that DNA- or ATP-binding residues directly involved in translocation are hotspots for genetic disease mutations. Thus, our findings shed light on the etiology of XPD-associated genetic syndromes.

 Cells in highly crowded environments are exposed to fluctuating mechanical forces. While cells can activate the cortical migration machinery to escape from undesirable compressive stress, the consequence to less motile cells and of prolonged extensive confinement is yet to be uncovered. Here, we demonstrate that nuclear deformation generated by axial confinement triggers a specific form of regulated cell death – ferroptosis. We show that axial confinement is sensed by the nucleus and results in Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fragmentation and mitochondrial ROS accumulation. Meanwhile, we detect cPLA2 translocation to mitochondria. These mitochondrial ROS accumulation and arachidonic acid production concertedly lead to lipid peroxidation and evoke ferroptosis. Interestingly, we find in osteoarthritis, a disease intimately associated with mechanical overloading and inflammation, characteristics of confinement-induced ferroptosis including mitochondrial localization of cPLA2 and high ROS. Together, our findings unveil a pivotal role of cell nucleus and mitochondria in linking mechanical confinement with cell death, highlighting the orchestration of Drp1 and cPLA2 in confinement-induced ferroptosis.

 Methanesulfonic acid, a key oxidation product of dimethyl sulfide, plays a crucial role in the atmospheric sulfur cycle and is an important contributor to aerosol growth and cloud condensation nuclei formation in remote marine and polar atmospheres. Its role is particularly significant in the Southern Ocean, where particle concentrations are low and biogenic sulfur emissions help shape cloud properties. Here, we focus on an eight-day period during the austral summer along coastal East Antarctica marked by elevated gaseous MSA that coincided with persistent katabatic outflow. By combining our ship-based observations, back-trajectory analysis and thermodynamic modelling, we show that this outflow brings biogenically dominated, highly acidic aerosols with elevated gaseous methanesulfonic acid produced by evaporation from aerosol particles. Although a decrease in relative humidity can enhance this process, aerosol acidity is identified as the primary driver. Our findings highlight the strongly acidic nature of Southern Ocean aerosol and provide new insights into processes involved in the marine sulfur cycle. Acidity-driven MSA evaporation should be considered when using dimethyl sulfide oxidation products to evaluate and improve atmospheric chemistry and climate models.

 Crustal recycling, a fundamental process promoting planetary differentiation, is conventionally attributed to plate tectonics on Earth. However, the mechanisms driving this process in tectonically stagnant regimes remain ambiguous. The heavy sulfur isotope (δ34S = 2.0–2.4‰) composition of troilites in the newly-discovered 4.2 Ga high-Al basalt from the South Pole–Aitken (SPA) basin indicates the incorporation of surficial degassed 34S-enriched crustal materials into the mantle. Numerical simulations of the SPA-forming impact and the induced mantle convection show that uplifted molten crustal materials are exposed to vacuum for about one hour, leading to degassing and enrichment of 34S, then transported to depths greater than 200 km to provide a hybrid mantle source for high-Al basaltic magmatism. Our integrated petrological geochemical numerical study provides the mechanistic validation of impact-driven crustal recycling on the Moon, fundamentally advancing our capacity to decode early crust–mantle evolution in terrestrial bodies within the inner Solar System.

 The origin of depleted, intermediate, and enriched geochemical reservoirs on Mars has long been debated, with competing models invoking mantle heterogeneity versus crustal contributions. Resolving this is central to understanding the martian mantle composition, crust-mantle interactions, and magma evolution. Here we examine the role of closed- and open-system processes on shergottite magma rare earth element (REE) evolution. We present the first complete REE dataset for olivine, the earliest crystallising phase and proxy for primitive melts, and REEs for olivine-hosted melt inclusions and late-stage merrillite, enabling robust tracking of REE evolution throughout shergottite crystallisation. Depleted and intermediate shergottites exhibit closed-system behaviour, indicating derivation from distinct mantle sources. Enriched shergottites record mixed processes, some reflecting enriched mantle sources and others open-system REE evolution, likely through assimilation of enriched material by depleted magmas. Shergottite diversity thus reflects both preserved mantle heterogeneities and dynamic open-system processes, highlighting the importance of an enriched crustal reservoir.

 Silicon, earth’s second most abundant element, cycles via biogeochemical processes in terrestrial and oceanic environments. The marine sediment-water interface is thought to divide biological-dominated (water) from abiotic-dominated (sediment) silica cycling processes. Studies indicate marine extremophile bacteria induce silica precipitation, but the quantitative importance of microorganisms in broader sediment silica cycling remains unexplored. We hypothesize that microorganisms significantly influence sediment silica cycling, challenging the prevailing divide of microbial importance. Within hours, sediment microbes expedited silica sequestration through rapid coupled dissolution/reprecipitation processes in marine deltaic sediment experiments. Using radiotracer silicon-32, we reveal that microbial mediation enhanced silica uptake, surpassing abiotic uptake by 3.6-fold in dilute suspensions (silica < 100 μM) and 3.4-fold in surface sediment porewater simulations. We assert that microorganisms drive significant diagenetic silica cycling rates, facilitating authigenic silica precipitation through previously reported mechanisms from microscopy analysis.

 Climate change is destabilizing Arctic landscapes by accelerating permafrost degradation, leading to more frequent slope failures, especially during summers. Summer is also the high touristic season for nature-based tourism in the Arctic, attracting visitors unfamiliar with permafrost-related risks. In this context, the Yukon, West Greenland, and Svalbard face both intensifying permafrost degradation and growing summer tourism, making them relevant cases for examining the intersections between permafrost and tourism. While studies and adaptation strategies prioritize local communities, they tend to overlook tourists, a growing demographic in permafrost regions. This tourism growth puts additional economic and safety burdens on local communities. It is argued that tourism should be more fully integrated into adaptation strategies to permafrost degradation and to that end, we propose three recommendations: stronger dialogue with tourism actors; target audiences for improved risk communication; integrate risk communication on permafrost degradation in tourism development goals. Overall, we claim that the inclusion of tourism in adaptation strategies will further contribute to Arctic communities’ resilience.

 Marine calcifiers support ecosystem services, including shell fisheries and coral reefs. Constraining the saturation state of the calcification media of these organisms is essential to understand the response of biomineralisation to environmental change. Here we synthesise aragonite over variable pH, saturation state, temperature, and in the presence of simple biomolecules. We show that the lithium/magnesium distribution coefficient, relating aragonite and precipitation fluid compositions, is significantly affected by precipitation rate but not by temperature or pH. Precipitation rate reflects saturation state and temperature, so lithium/magnesium of biogenic aragonite can be used to calculate mineral precipitation rate and, if the precipitation temperature is known, to reconstruct calcification medium saturation state. Applying the distribution coefficients to a published calcifier dataset indicates that calcification media saturation state is ca. 9 to 13 at 18–30 °C and ca. 6 to 10 at 10–18 °C.

 Carbon dioxide release from the Southern Ocean is generally recognized as a primary factor driving atmospheric carbon dioxide rise during the deglaciation; however, the Bølling-Allerød period saw an atmospheric carbon dioxide plateau, despite diminished biological pump and enhanced ventilation in the Southern Ocean favoring carbon dioxide outgassing. Here we, by compiling productivity records based on multiple geochemical and paleontological proxies, suggest that this plateau was achieved by basin-wide elevated biological pump in the oligotrophic North Pacific. This basin-scale carbon sink is a result of oligotrophy and stratification, allowing for prolonged and complete consumption of deep-sourced nutrients and carbon dioxide in the deepened euphotic zone when North Pacific Intermediate Water was sluggish. This carbon sink is amplified by synchronously enhanced stratification-induced nitrogen fixation. Extending the Bølling-Allerød warming-biological pump analogy to current and future warming scenarios, however, is constrained by human-forced biogeochemical-physical processes, yielding large uncertainties in biological pump responses and feedbacks.
