10.1088/1748-9326/adb767,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇研究论文利用卫星观测数据，特别是Sentinel-5 Precursor卫星上的TROPOMI仪器获取的二氧化氮（NO2）数据，来估算全球14个大型露天铜矿的氮氧化物（NOx）排放量。研究发现，矿区的NOx排放量与铜产量、矿石处理量以及总物料移动量相关。通过时间序列分析，研究表明总物料移动量能最好地反映NOx排放量的年际变化。总的来说，该研究表明卫星NO2观测在追踪采矿活动和评估采矿业环境影响方面具有潜力。,"['nitrogen oxide emissions', 'satellite observations', 'nitrogen dioxide', 'TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI)', 'Sentinel-5 Precursor', 'air quality monitoring', 'mining activities']",Iolanda Ialongo;Henrik Virta;Janne Hakkarainen;Cem Özcan;Mikko Ranta;Simon Zieleniewski,Unveiling nitrogen oxide emissions from open-pit copper mines through satellite observations,"Copper is a critical mineral for clean energy and transportation, and it is necessary for a sustainable economy that aims at reducing fossil fuel usage. Assessing the performance and environmental impacts of copper mining is therefore necessary to evaluate the progress towards sustainable development. In this study, we estimate the nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions (largely attributable to the diesel-powered mobile fleet) over 14 of the world’s largest open-pit copper mines. We derive the emissions by applying a data-driven approach to the satellite-based nitrogen dioxide (NO2) observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument on board the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite. We find that the annual NOx emissions over the different mines are coupled to the corresponding copper production, ore processed and total material moved. The time series analysis reveals that the annual amount of total material moved over the open pit of each mine best reproduces the year-to-year variability of the NOx emissions. Overall, satellite NO2 observations show good potential in tracking mining activities and for improving the assessment of the environmental impact of the mining industry."

This study explores BrC's imaginary refractive index (k) using data from 12 European sites. Residential emissions are a major organic aerosol (OA) source in winter, while secondary organic aerosol (SOA) dominates in summer. Source-specific k values were derived, improving model accuracy. The findings highlight BrC's climate impact and emphasize source-specific constraints in atmospheric models. 
 Brown carbon (BrC) is a fraction of organic aerosol (OA) that absorbs radiation in the ultraviolet and short visible wavelengths. Its contribution to radiative forcing is uncertain due to limited knowledge of its imaginary refractive index (k). This study investigates the variability of k for OA from wildfires, residential, shipping, and traffic emission sources over Europe. The Multiscale Online Nonhydrostatic Atmosphere Chemistry  (MONARCH) model simulated OA concentrations and source contributions, feeding an offline optical tool to constrain k values at 370 nm. The model was evaluated against OA mass concentrations from aerosol chemical speciation monitors (ACSMs) and filter sample measurements, as well as aerosol light absorption measurements at 370 nm derived from an Aethalometer™ from 12 sites across Europe. Results show that MONARCH captures the OA temporal variability across environments (regional, suburban, and urban background). Residential emissions are a major OA source in colder months, while secondary organic aerosol (SOA) dominates in warmer periods. Traffic is a minor primary OA contributor. Biomass and coal combustion significantly influence OA absorption, with shipping emissions also notable near harbors. Optimizing k values at 370 nm revealed significant variability in OA light absorption, influenced by emission sources and environmental conditions. Derived k values for biomass burning (0.03 to 0.13), residential (0.008 to 0.13), shipping (0.005 to 0.08), and traffic (0.005 to 0.07) sources improved model representation of OA absorption compared to a constant k. Introducing such emission source-specific constraints is an innovative approach to enhance OA absorption in atmospheric models."
10.5194/acp-25-2631-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了天气模式如何影响南大洋上空的云凝结核（CCN）浓度，进而影响云的微物理特性和地球的能量平衡。研究通过分析不同天气条件下CCN浓度的变化，揭示了降水清除作用和气团来源对CCN季节性循环的影响。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术，但其研究内容与大气成分分析密切相关，为利用卫星观测等遥感手段监测和理解南大洋区域的气候变化提供了理论基础。通过了解不同天气模式下CCN的分布特征，可以更好地利用卫星数据反演云的性质和辐射效应，从而提高气候模型的预测准确性。,"['cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)', 'Southern Ocean clouds', 'synoptic meteorology', 'precipitation scavenging', 'air mass back-trajectories', 'boundary layer', 'atmospheric composition']",Tahereh Alinejadtabrizi;Yi Huang;Francisco Lang;Steven Siems;Michael Manton;Luis Ackermann;Melita Keywood;Ruhi Humphries;Paul Krummel;Alastair Williams;Greg Ayers,Contributions of the synoptic meteorology to the seasonal cloud condensation nuclei cycle over the Southern Ocean,"Clouds over the Southern Ocean are crucial to Earth's energy balance, but understanding the factors that control them is complex. Our research examines how weather patterns affect tiny particles called cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), which influence cloud properties. Using data from Kennaook / Cape Grim, we found that winter air from Antarctica brings cleaner conditions with lower CCN, while summer patterns from Australia transport more particles. Precipitation also helps reduce CCN in winter. 
 Cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) play a fundamental role in determining the microphysical properties of low-level clouds that are crucial for defining the energy budget over the Southern Ocean (SO). However, many aspects of the CCN budget over the SO remains poorly understood, including the role of the synoptic meteorology. In this study, we classify six distinct synoptic regimes over the Kennaook / Cape Grim Observatory (CGO) and examine their influence on the seasonal cycle of the CCN concentration (NCCN). Three “winter” regimes are dominant when the subtropical ridge (STR) is strong and centered at lower latitudes, while three “summer” regimes prevail when the STR shifts to higher latitudes. Distinct winter and summer “baseline” synoptic patterns contribute to the seasonal cycle of NCCN, with the winter baseline regime characterized by heavier precipitation (0.10 vs. 0.03 mm h−1), a deeper boundary layer (850 vs. 900 hPa), and lower NCCN (71 vs. 137 cm−3) than the summer one. Across these two baseline regimes, we observe a significant inverse relationship between precipitation and NCCN, underscoring the contribution of precipitation in reducing NCCN over the SO. An analysis of air mass back-trajectories, specifically at the free-troposphere level, supports this seasonal distinction, with wintertime air masses originating more frequently from higher latitudes. The summertime STR is seen as a barrier to Antarctic air masses reaching the latitude of the CGO. Conversely, the summer baseline regime is found to pass more frequently over continental Australia before reaching the CGO, consistent with enhanced radon concentrations."

Fahey;Shang Wu;Jiaping Wang;Jing Cai;Zeyuan Tian;Zhouyang Zhang;Jia Xing;Aijun Ding;Shuxiao Wang,Accounting for the black carbon aging process in a two-way coupled meteorology–air quality model,"Black carbon (BC) affects climate and the environment, and its aging process alters its properties. Current models, like WRF-CMAQ, lack full accounting for it. We developed the WRF-CMAQ-BCG model to better represent BC aging by introducing bare and coated BC species and their conversion. The WRF-CMAQ-BCG model introduces the capability to simulate BC mixing states and bare and coated BC wet deposition, and it improves the accuracy of BC mass concentration and aerosol optics. 
 Black carbon (BC) exerts significant impacts on both climate and environment. The BC aging process alters its hygroscopicity and light absorption properties. Current models, like the Weather Research and Forecasting – Community Multiscale Air Quality (WRF-CMAQ) two-way coupled model, inadequately characterize these alterations. In this study, we accounted for the BC aging process in the WRF-CMAQ model (WRF-CMAQ-BCG). We introduced two new species (bare BC and coated BC) into the model and implemented a module to simulate the conversion from bare BC to coated BC, thereby characterizing the aging process. Furthermore, we improved the wet-deposition and aerosol optical modules to analyze the effects of BC aging on hydrophobicity and light absorption. The simulated results indicate a spatial distribution pattern with bare BC prevalent near emission sources and coated BC more common farther from sources. The average number fraction of coated BC (NFcoated) is approximately 57 %. Temporal variation exhibits a distinct diurnal pattern, with NFcoated increasing during the daytime. The spatial distribution of wet deposition varies significantly between bare and coated BC. Bare BC exhibits a point-like deposition pattern, whereas coated BC displays a zonal distribution. Notably, coated BC dominates the BC wet-deposition process. Additionally, incorporating the BC aging process reduces BC wet deposition by 17.7 % and increases BC column concentration by 10.5 %. The simulated mass absorption cross-section (MAC) value improved agreement with observed measurements. Overall, the WRF-CMAQ-BCG model enhances the capability to analyze aging-related variables and the BC mixing state while also improving performance in terms of wet deposition and optical properties."

Shepherd;Martin D. King;Andrew D. Ward;Edward J. Stuckey;Rebecca J. L. Welbourn;Neil Brough;Adam Milsom;Christian Pfrang;Thomas Arnold,The lifetimes and potential change in planetary albedo owing to the oxidation of thin surfactant organic films extracted from atmospheric aerosol by hydroxyl (OH) radicals at the air–water interface of particles,"Thin film formation at the air–water interface from material extracted from atmospheric aerosol was demonstrated, supporting the core–shell morphology. Film thicknesses were approximately 10 Å and 17 Å for urban and remote extracts, respectively. Exposure to gas-phase OH radicals showed fast reactions and short lifetimes of around 1 h. The effect on the Earth's radiative balance indicated that removing half of the film could significantly increase the top-of-atmosphere albedo for urban films. 
 Water-insoluble organic material extracted from atmospheric aerosol samples collected in urban (Royal Holloway, University of London, UK) and remote (Halley Research Station, Antarctica) locations were shown to form stable thin surfactant films at an air–water interface. These organic films reacted quickly with gas-phase OH radicals and may impact planetary albedo.  The X-ray reflectivity measurements additionally indicate that the film may be consistent with having a structure with increased electron density of film molecules towards the water, suggesting amphiphilic behaviour. Assuming the material extracted from atmospheric aerosol produces thin films on aqueous particles and cloud droplets, modelling the oxidation kinetics with a kinetic model of aerosol surface and bulk chemistry (KM-SUB) suggests half-lives of minutes to an hour and values of ksurf of ∼2×10-7 and ∼5×10-5 cm2 s−1 for urban and remote aerosol film extracts, respectively. The superfluous half-lives calculated at typical OH atmospheric ambient mixing ratios are smaller than the typical residence time of atmospheric aerosols; thus, oxidation of organic material should be considered in atmospheric modelling. Thin organic films at the air–water interface of atmospheric aerosol or cloud droplets may alter the light-scattering properties of the aerosol. X-ray reflectivity measurements of atmospheric aerosol film material at the air–water interface resulted in calculated film thickness values to be either ∼10  or ∼17 Å for remote or urban aerosol extracts, respectively, and oxidation did not remove the films completely.  One-dimensional radiative transfer modelling suggests the oxidation of thin organic films on atmospheric particles by OH radicals may reduce the planetary albedo by a small, but potentially significant, amount."

We evaluate the contributions of climatic, anthropogenic, and biogenic factors by season and region. We find persistent emission controls will alter the nonlinear response of ozone to its precursors and dominate the declining ozone level. The outcomes highlight the importance of human actions, even with a climate penalty on air quality. 
 Climate change and associated human response are supposed to greatly alter surface ozone (O3), an air pollutant generated through photochemical reactions involving both anthropogenic and biogenic precursors. However, a comprehensive evaluation of China's O3 response to these multiple changes has been lacking. We present a modeling framework under Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP2-4.5), incorporating future changes in local and foreign anthropogenic emissions, meteorological conditions, and biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions. From the 2020s to 2060s, daily maximum 8 h average (MDA8) O3 concentration is simulated to decline by 7.7 ppb in the warm season (April–September) and 1.1 ppb in the non-warm season (October–March) over the country, with a substantial reduction in exceedances of national O3 standards. Notably, O3 decreases are more pronounced in developed regions such as Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH), the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and the Pearl River Delta (PRD) during the warm season, with reductions of 9.7, 14.8, and 12.5 ppb, respectively. Conversely, in the non-warm season, the MDA8 O3 in BTH and YRD will increase by 5.5 and 3.3 ppb, partly attributed to reduced NOx emissions and thereby a weakened titration effect. O3 pollution will thus expand into the non-warm season in the future. Sensitivity analyses reveal that local emission change will predominantly influence future O3 distribution and magnitude, with contributions from other factors within ±25 %. Furthermore, the joint impact of multiple factors on O3 reduction will be larger than the sum of individual factors, due to changes in the O3 formation regime. This study highlights the necessity of region-specific emission control strategies to mitigate potential O3 increases during the non-warm season and under the climate penalty."

Pure liquid water droplets are liquid until about -35 °C without the presence of a small subset of aerosols, ice-nucleating particles (INPs). These INPs lead to primary ice formation and therefore impact the phase of clouds. The dataset described herein provides INP concentration measurements at two altitudes. Connecting this data to synoptic conditions and ambient data might provide a better understanding of INPs in Finnish Lapland. 
 A novel filter-based sampler was deployed during the Pallas Cloud Experiment (PaCE) 2022 for a one-month period in September and October 2022 in Finnish Lapland around 5 km north of the Sammaltunturi station. This area frequently features low-level clouds during autumn. The sampler was deployed on-board of an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) and on the ground. Two filters were deployed simultaneously on the ground and on the UAV to enable a comparison between the two vertical levels. The dataset contains 14 INP spectra that feature a temporal overlap at both altitudes, a handling blank filter to assess possible contamination during handling and one additional sample from both setups without the temporal overlap. The dataset is the first of its kind, providing altitude-based INP concentrations in Finnish Lapland. There is no clear systematic difference between INP concentrations measured at the different altitudes. The INP concentration is variable over the period measured and also does show some differences on the vertical level. The connection to synoptic conditions and ambient measurements might provide a better understanding of the origin, lifetime, and distribution of INPs in Finnish Lapland."

Do;Sabine Griessbach;Patrick Jöckel;Domenico Taraborrelli,The MESSy DWARF (based on MESSy v2.55.2),"Normally, the Modular Earth Submodel System (MESSy) is linked to complete dynamic models to create chemical climate models. However, the modular concept of MESSy and the newly developed DWARF component presented here make it possible to create simplified models that contain only one or a few process descriptions. This is very useful for technical optimisation, such as porting to GPUs, and can be used to create less complex models, such as a chemical box model. 
 The adaptation of Earth system model (ESM) codes to modern computing architectures is challenging as ESMs consist of a multitude of different components. Historically grown and developed by scientists rather than software engineers, the codes of the individual components are often interwoven, making the optimisation of the ESMs rather challenging, if not impossible. Thus, in the last few years, the codes have become increasingly modularised, and, with that, different components are now disentangled from each other. This helps porting the code section by section to modern computing architectures, e.g. to GPUs.For more than 20 years, the modularisation has been the fundamental concept of the Modular Earth Submodel System (MESSy). It is an integrated framework providing data structures and methods to build comprehensive ESMs from individual components. Each component, e.g. a cloud microphysical scheme, dry deposition of tracer gases, or diagnostic tools, as output along satellite orbits, is coded as an individual so-called submodel. Each submodel is connected via the MESSy infrastructure with all other components, together forming a comprehensive model system. MESSy was mainly developed for research in atmospheric chemistry, and, so far, it has always been connected  to a dynamical (climate or weather forecast) model, i.e. what we call a base model. The base model is a development outside the MESSy framework. Running a full dynamical model for technical tests when porting only one submodel is a tedious task and unnecessarily resource-consuming. Therefore, we developed the so-called MESSy DWARF, a simplified base model based on the MESSy infrastructure. We implemented the definition of a very simple grid, a parallelisation scheme, and a time control to replace a fully fledged base model.The MESSy DWARF serves as a valuable tool for technical applications, such as porting individual component implementations to GPUs and performance tests or as an easy test environment for process implementations. Due to the MESSy structure, the applied components can be  used in a dynamical model without any changes because the interface is exactly the same. Furthermore, the MESSy DWARF is suited for scientific purposes running simplified models (with only a selection of components), e.g. a chemical box model for the analysis of chamber experiments or a trajectory box model imitating an air parcel rising slowly into the stratosphere. Column and plume models could also easily be built based on the DWARF.In this article, we introduce the technical setup of the MESSy DWARF and show four example applications: (1) a simple application using a component calculating orbital parameters, (2) a chemical kinetics model including photolysis frequency calculation, (3) an application of a chemical box model, and (4) some details on a GPU performance test of the chemical kinetics model."

Smith,Developing Measurement-Informed Methane Emissions Inventory Estimates at Midstream Compressor Stations,"Natural gas transmissions and storage compressor stations account for the largest share of anthropogenic methane (CH4) emissions in New York State (NYS). Yet, NYS’s CH4 emissions inventory is based on measurements that are a decade old and potentially unlikely to be representative of NYS operations. Here, we present results from a comprehensive, multiscale aerial CH4 measurement campaign across all NYS transmission and storage compressor stations. We find a skewed emissions distribution, with 20% of stations accounting for 74% of total CH4 emissions. Emissions at engine-driven compressor stations are, on average, 3–4× higher than emissions at turbine-driven compressor stations, thus demonstrating the need for separate emissions factors for engine- and turbine-drive compressor stations. Overall, measurement-informed emissions inventory from midstream transmission and storage compressor stations in NYS is 72% and 69% lower than the current NYS inventory, respectively. We estimate updated emissions factors of 464 [95% CI: 162–920] metric ton (MT) CH4/station/yr and 139 [97, 191] MT CH4/station/yr for engine- and turbine-based transmission compressor stations, respectively. Similarly, we estimate an updated emissions factor of 413 [164, 733] MT CH4/station/yr for engine-based storage compressor stations.

Calvert;Nathan J. Huskins;Elijah G. Schnitzler,Intermolecular Interactions Enhance the Light Absorption of a Methoxyphenol Constituent of Biomass Burning Emissions,"Brown carbon (BrC) components of biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA) absorb sunlight at visible wavelengths. However, it is not clear whether the total light absorption of this BrC is simply the sum of the contributions of the individual components or whether the components can bind noncovalently to give additional absorption through charge transfer. Here, intermolecular interactions between guaiacol and quinones (1,4-benzoquinone and 1,4-naphthoquinone) were identified in proxies of the nonpolar, water-insoluble phase of BBOA, using UV–vis spectroscopy. Guaiacol and its derivatives are some of the most abundant emissions of smoldering coniferous species. Enhanced light absorption occurred instantaneously upon mixing colorless guaiacol with either quinone in n-heptane and did not increase with time, in contrast to the absorbance changes that would be expected for a covalent product. This enhancement decreased by about 25% as the temperature increased from 303 to 323 K, consistent with exothermic association to give complexes, yielding enthalpies of complexation of −13.3 ± 0.6 and −12.3 ± 0.4 kJ mol–1 for guaiacol with benzoquinone and naphthoquinone, respectively. Enhancement was also observed upon gas–liquid partitioning of benzoquinone into thin films of guaiacol, for example, with a thickness of 20 μm. This multiphase processing, mimicking partitioning of quinones into liquid BBOA, produced absorption comparable to moderately absorbing BrC from other sources, suggestive of the atmospheric relevance of these interactions."

Currently, VOCs monitoring primarily uses Gas Chromatography‐Mass Spectrometry (GC‐MS) and Proton Transfer Reaction‐Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (PTR‐ToF‐MS). GC‐MS is favored for its accurate compound identification capabilities but is limited by its lower temporal resolution. Conversely, PTR‐ToF‐MS, while achieving minute‐scale resolution by directly ionizing samples, struggles to detect low‐proton‐affinity compounds. Here, based on 5 years of long‐term online monitoring data, we propose the Adaptive Convolutional Tree Ensemble (ACTE) model to surpass current instruments limitations and accurately obtain high‐resolution (5‐min) VOCs. Our results indicate that this model consistently achieves robust predictive accuracy across different major species categories, notably achieving R2 values of 0.92 and 0.89 for alkanes and alkenes, respectively, which mostly have low‐proton‐affinity. Furthermore, by comparing simulations using different VOCs temporal resolutions in ozone mechanism modeling, we found that models with higher temporal resolution more accurately and comprehensively capture the rapidly occurring photochemical reactions, whereas hourly models tend to overlook many details, potentially leading to inaccuracies in understanding the related mechanisms. This study underscores the potential of machine learning to improve monitoring of atmospheric pollutants and enhance our understanding of atmospheric chemical processes."

 Climate change and air pollution are interconnected global crises, with concurrent heatwaves and extreme ozone levels threatening public health. This study investigates urban population exposure to concurrent extreme heat and ozone pollution across Chinese cities from 2003 to 2020, using high-resolution (1 km) daily temperature and ozone data. We quantify annual exposure rates at national and city levels, distinguishing contributions from urban population growth and compound event frequency. Findings show a 67% increase in compound exposure over 18 years, with 38% of cities, particularly in the North China Plain, exhibiting significant upward trends. Population growth mainly drives exposure in southern cities, while rising event frequency has a greater impact in northern regions. Core urban areas have become critical hotspots, with some major cities’ centers contributing over 80% to total exposure in 2020. The results highlight the urgent need for targeted climate adaptation strategies to mitigate health risks in urban environments."

 Changes in vegetation carbon uptake are largely influenced by the timing and magnitude of the peak of the growing season (POS), when vegetation photosynthesis reaches its maximum. However, the factors controlling the timing of POS remain poorly understood, leaving us uncertain about its future trajectory. Using satellite observations and carbon flux measurements, we show that, in recent decades, increased early-season carbon uptake has been driven by both an earlier onset of the growing season and higher temperatures. In 93% of northern (>30°N) vegetation, these increases in early-season carbon uptake were associated with an advancement of POS. This ongoing shift suggests a developmental constraint on seasonal productivity, potentially limiting carbon uptake later in the season. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation that reconciles previous observations linking earlier growing season onset, rising temperatures, and shifts in POS timing, and suggest a decrease in late-season carbon uptake with climate warming.

 Observational evidences indicate a significant decline in dust storm frequencies over the East Asian arid-semiarid region during recent decades, which creates a strong contrast with a great increase in sulfate emissions over monsoonal Asia. However, the causes for decline of dust activities are still controversial. Through conducting a set of idealized sensitivity experiments of regional aerosol perturbations, here we show that anthropogenic sulfate aerosols over monsoonal Asia remarkably suppress the regional dust activities over East Asia. Southward shift of Asian westerly jet stream induced by sulfate aerosols results in increasing precipitation and weakening surface wind speeds over the arid-semiarid region, thereby suppressing local dust emission fluxes. Further, the latest Sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project simulations indicate that anthropogenic aerosols partly drive the recent weakening in regional dust activities and that future change of regional dust activities will likely depend on emissions scenarios of Asian anthropogenic aerosols and greenhouse gases.

 In recent years, South Korea has continued to experience high PM2.5 events despite government efforts, posing a significant threat to human life. This study examines the relationship between high winter PM2.5 concentrations in South Korea and atmospheric circulation patterns on synoptic and quasi-biweekly timescales. During the winters of 2018–2022, periodicities of 4–8 and 8–26 days were observed in PM2.5 concentrations, playing a crucial role in high PM2.5 events. Composite analysis revealed that while atmospheric conditions during high PM2.5 events shared similar characteristics, their intensity and spatial extent varied. An anticyclonic anomaly was observed in the upper levels over the Korean Peninsula, and the dipole pattern of the mean sea level pressure (MSLP) weakened the Siberian High, reducing northerly winds and weakening the East Asian winter monsoon. Under this atmospheric circulation, both low planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) and stable atmosphere contribute to high PM2.5 concentrations along with weak ventilation. Anticyclonic anomalies associated with trough intensity originated from different sources: synoptic-scale anomalies from the North Atlantic (∼13 days prior) and quasi-biweekly anomalies from Siberia (∼8 days prior), propagating southeastward as precursor signals. PM2.5 transport contributions differed by timescale: synoptic events were dominated by transport from eastern China, while quasi-biweekly events showed greater contributions from northern China. When overlapping, these timescales exhibited a synergistic effect, creating more favorable conditions for extreme high-concentration events."

 Climate change and the resulting warming caused by human activities, such as releasing greenhouse gases (GHG), notably carbon dioxide (CO2), are paramount concerns in the contemporary era. Therefore, it is essential to understand spatial and temporal variations of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (XCO2) on national and international scales and the role of controlling variables. This research examines the role of controlling variables on XCO2 by utilizing spatiotemporal modeling, correlation analysis, and machine learning methods to determine the sinks and sources of CO2 and their changes in the Middle East (ME). First, XCO2 data from the OCO-2 satellite spanning from 2015 to 2021 were employed for spatiotemporal analysis. The temporal analysis of XCO2 showed peak levels during spring (May) and the lowest levels during summer (September). Additionally, the spatial dispersion of XCO2 revealed significant spatial heterogeneity influenced by land cover. Areas with high vegetation abundance and suitable weather conditions exhibited minimum XCO2 levels, while vice versa occurred. Next, the correlation analysis between the principal controlling variables and XCO2 revealed that, except for vegetation abundance and anthropogenic CO2 emissions, they exhibited predominantly negative and positive correlations throughout the year, respectively. However, the correlation patterns for temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind speed varied across different months, showing both negative and positive relationships depending on the month. Recognizing that simple correlation alone cannot determine which variables played the most significant role in XCO2 each month, this study employed machine learning and Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) techniques. The results showed that, except for March and September, when precipitation and wind speed respectively had the most significant influence on determining XCO2, air temperature played the dominant role in other months. Additionally, the average monthly results revealed that air temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and vegetation abundance, respectively, played the most significant roles in XCO2. In contrast, CO2 emissions had the most negligible impact. These results highlight the considerable influence of meteorological and environmental variables on regulating XCO2 levels and distributions throughout the ME. By elucidating the seasonality of the carbon cycle and identifying key XCO2 drivers over the ME, this study provides valuable insights to guide regional climate change mitigation policies and further analysis of vulnerable semi-arid ecosystems."

 Changing climate has substantially altered the spatio-temporal rainfall pattern, especially over the Indian subcontinent where the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) predominates from June to September. This study explores the changes in the rainfall variability over Northern India (NI) for the period 1981–2020 and this region exhibits topographic diversity, encompassing arid Northwestern India (NWI) due to desert conditions with minimal rainfall and the rainfall-intensive region in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP). In recent decades, a dipolar rainfall pattern has been observed over NI, characterized by a significant increase (reduction) in mean as well as intense rainfall over NWI (IGP). Rainfall intensity over the IGP has decreased by 10.2 %, 7.6 %, and 12 % at the 95th, 99th, and 99.9th percentiles, respectively, while the NWI has increased by 15 % and 9 % at the 95th and 99th percentiles, with a slight 0.17 % decline at the 99.9th percentile. These changes can be attributed to an increase in the frequency of monsoon depressions by about 46 % over the Arabian Sea (AS), while the Bay of Bengal (BoB) has experienced about 32 % decrease. Moreover, increased precipitation in the NWI is characterized by enhanced moisture transport and convergence, a robust low-level jet, unstable atmospheric conditions leading to strong convection. Conversely, the IGP experiences lower moisture transport and convergence, more stable atmospheric conditions, and consequently, reduced precipitation. Furthermore, this study utilizes the Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project of CMIP6 data to investigate the influence of aerosols, greenhouse gases (GHGs), and natural forcings on precipitation patterns. The results reveal a similar dipole spatial pattern of rainfall due to increased aerosol concentration, indicating the role of aerosols in shaping the ISM rainfall patterns. We further employ Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) to assess how aerosol loadings impact ISM characteristics."

In this study, we elucidate for the first time the role of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in enhancing oxygen activation on manganese oxide (γ-MnO2) surface, thereby facilitating the oxidation of nitric oxide (NO) to nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The theoretical calculation results further demonstrate that the adsorbed SO2 and the formed sulfate can promote the adsorption of O2 and the reactivity of surface reactive oxygen species toward NO oxidation on γ-MnO2 (110) surface, respectively. During SO2 with O2 reaction, the formation of surface sulfate and surface-active oxygen atoms serves as new active sites to facilitate the oxidation of NO to NO2. Comparative analysis of the energy profiles reveals that NO oxidation with SO2 can release more heat energy than that without SO2, indicating enhanced thermodynamic accessibility in the presence of SO2. Therefore, a novel mechanism for the sulfate-mediated activation of O2 is proposed, which sheds light on the synergistic effects of multiple pollutants in heterogeneous reactions and is significant for understanding NO oxidation both in the atmosphere and in exhaust treatment."

The production rate constant was 2.2–3.9 d−1, significantly higher than those in temperate meadows (<0.02 d−1). The CH4 emission rate from the meadow was 835 ± 124 μmol m−2 d−1. A global meta‐analysis further revealed the CH4 emission rate in tropical seagrass meadows is approximately 8 times higher than temperate meadows. Global seagrass meadows emit 0.3 Tg CH4 yr−1, with over 90% from tropical meadows and resulting in an 8.6% reduction of the seagrass carbon burial on a 20‐year time horizon.

 The emission, transmission, and secondary generation of atmospheric pollutants occur not only in proximity to the ground but also at elevated altitudes. Vertical distribution plays a pivotal role in understanding the intricate mechanisms that govern atmospheric pollutants. Although ground-based remote sensing offers valuable insights into vertical pollutant profiles, it is limited to obtaining vertical profiles at specific locations, which cannot capture the spatially continuous distribution of vertical profiles at the city scale. Thus, these methods cannot fully support the understanding of high-altitude transport and vertical exchange of atmospheric pollutants. This study proposes a multimodal intermediate fusion (MIF) architecture based on a residual network. Using inputs such as satellite data and meteorological parameters tied to profiles retrieved by multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscope (MAX-DOAS), we reconstruct the daytime high spatial resolution (1 × 1 × 0.1 km) and temporal resolution (15 min) NO2 spatiotemporal distribution. The mean correlation between MIF reconstructions and ground-based in situ observations from the China National Environmental Monitoring Center reaches 0.813, and the correlation with TROPOMI tropospheric NO2 data reaches 0.750–0.796 in the different distance groups. The MIF performance significantly exceeds that of the WRF-Chem model in terms of resolution and accuracy. The full-coverage high-resolution 3D NO2 distribution allows us to analyze the distribution of NO2 and estimate its transport, revealing an annual net output of 0.780 Gg of NO2 from Hefei's urban areas. The vertical transport at high altitudes in urban areas is 28.2 % higher than that in the suburban regions. Notably, the annual high-altitude NO2 transport from 8:00 to 16:00 local time constitutes approximately 23.7 % of the annual NOX emissions in the Hefei urban area. During pollution events, the MIF reconstructions can identify two typical processes: 1) transport from elevated altitudes to ground level, and 2) external transport from the urban surface to high altitudes and then transport to suburban areas from elevated altitudes, ultimately reaching the suburban surface. The 3D NO2 distribution reconstructed by MIF may help understand the impact of high-altitude transport and the vertical exchange of pollutants on atmospheric pollution and can serve as a scientific basis for air pollution control policies."

 The apportionment of equivalent black carbon (eBC) to combustion sources from liquid fuels (mainly fossil; eBCLF) and solid fuels (mainly non-fossil; eBCSF) is commonly performed using data from Aethalometer instruments (AE approach). This study evaluates the feasibility of using AE data to determine the absorption Ångström exponents (AAEs) for liquid fuels (AAELF) and solid fuels (AAESF), which are fundamental parameters in the AE approach. AAEs were derived from Aethalometer data as the fit in a logarithmic space of the six absorption coefficients (470–950 nm) versus the corresponding wavelengths. The findings indicate that AAELF can be robustly determined as the 1st percentile (PC1) of AAE values from fits with R2 > 0.99. This R2-filtering was necessary to remove extremely low and noisy-driven AAE values commonly observed under clean atmospheric conditions (i.e., low absorption coefficients). Conversely, AAESF can be obtained from the 99th percentile (PC99) of unfiltered AAE values. To optimize the signal from solid fuel sources, winter data should be used to calculate PC99, whereas summer data should be employed for calculating PC1 to maximize the signal from liquid fuel sources. The derived PC1 (AAELF) and PC99 (AAESF) values ranged from 0.79 to 1.08, and 1.45 to 1.84, respectively. The AAESF values were further compared with those constrained using the signal at mass-to-charge 60 (m/z 60), a tracer for fresh biomass combustion, measured using aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM) and aerosol mass spectrometry (AMS) instruments deployed at 16 sites. Overall, the AAESF values obtained from the two methods showed strong agreement, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.78. However, uncertainties in both approaches may vary due to site-specific sources, and in certain environments, such as traffic-dominated sites, neither approach may be fully applicable."

The results indicated that the ROLO‐RCF (RObotic Lunar Observatory model with correction factor)‐modified method was capable of reliably calculating nocturnal aerosol optical depths (AODs) and the Ångström exponent (AE440–870 nm) measured from the CE318‐T photometer, which was validated with synchronous observations of a lidar. The AOD day/night transition coherence test has firmly demonstrated the reliability of nighttime AODs obtained from a photometer at night‐to‐day and day‐to‐night time intervals. Both spectral AOD values and AE440–870 nm exhibited prominent diurnal variations, and nocturnal AODs showed a good continuity with daytime AODs in a wide range of moon's illuminations. The maximal AOD500 nm, PM2.5 and PM10 mass concentrations under a heavy dust event on 9–10 June, 2023 were 3.07, 2,800 and 9,400 μg/m3, respectively, and corresponding AE440–870 nm, fine‐mode fraction, and ratio of PM2.5/PM10 were 0.01, 0.17 and 0.24, respectively, implying the dominance of large desert dust particles in Ayvaj. The percentage departures of AOD500 nm showed systematically negative values (−22% ∼ −5%) during daytime and positive values (+6% ∼ +25%) in nighttime and corresponding AE440–870 nm ranged within ±25%, attributable to the frequent intrusion of dust events. Both daytime and nighttime AODs showed a similar monthly variation characteristic, and average AOD values (AOD440 nm of 0.25 ∼ 0.51) in prevailing dust seasons were generally greater than the ones (AOD440 nm of 0.16 ∼ 0.45) in September and October. In contrast, the monthly average AE440–870 nm exhibited an opposite pattern. The overall average daytime and nighttime AOD440 nm values were 0.327 ± 0.187 and 0.381 ± 0.135, respectively, and corresponding AE440–870 nm were 0.472 ± 0.192 and 0.467 ± 0.200, respectively, suggesting that coarse‐mode dust particles were the main contributors to total aerosol loading in Ayvaj. In summary, this paper has verified that the CE318‐T photometer had a unique capability to measure nocturnal aerosol optical parameters under a wide range of lunar phase cycles in Ayvaj. Such significant diurnal variability of dust AODs and AE440–870 nm disparity should be included in regional climate models to simulate its diurnal radiative effect in the future work."

 Aerosols chemical components from different sources significantly affect climate change and air quality. In this study, we developed a satellite-based aerosol component retrieval method based on multiple solution mixing mechanism (MSMM) to extract global aerosol component from POLDER polarimetric satellite observations from 2008 to 2012. The MSMM calculates the complex refractive index using the Lorentz-Lorenz relation and constrains the solute fraction with κ-Köhler theory to retrieve the following components: black carbon (BC), ammonium nitrate-like inorganic salts (AN), dust (DU), sea salt (SS), water-soluble organic matter (WSOM), water-insoluble organic matter (WIOM), and aerosol water content (AW). By analyzing the spatial distribution and seasonal characteristics of the seven aerosol components over a five-year period, we captured the significant patterns of each aerosol component over global anthropogenic and natural hotspot emission regions. The five-year average and the seasonal patterns of each component during 2008 show significant changes, consistent with our expectations and previous studies. The pattern of global brown carbon (BrC), which is estimated by the possible tracer substances, is correlated with the fire radiative power. After analyzing the time series changes of each component in different regions for five years, we fine that the fine-mode fraction of aerosol component mass concentration in the central-eastern region of China declined about 6.05% from 2008 to 2010, which is closely related to the strong implementation of environmental protection policies. Also, we find the global aerosol component mass fraction in 2012 shows anomalies, especially a significant increase in the AW component, which is explained by the high frequency of extreme weather. The aerosol components retrieved by the MSMM are comparable with MERRA-2, with the correlations up to 0.94 for BC and 0.88 for DU in representative regions. More comprehensive species of aerosol components can be obtained using the MSMM method than MERRA-2, which can be applied to future satellite observations with higher spatial resolution."

However, anthropogenic contribution to this decreased VWS remains uncertain. Here, we isolate the individual effects of greenhouse gases (GHS), aerosols, natural forcings, and internal climate variability on the decreased VWS over the WNP using multi-model ensemble simulations. We find that Eurasia’s inhomogeneous aerosol forcing triggers a southeastward-propagating wave train from central Europe and a meridional circulation teleconnection over southeastern Eurasia, inducing anomalous westerlies at 200 hPa in the WNP monsoon trough (MT) region. This dominates the weakening of VWS in the MT region, thereby promoting dynamic conditions favorable for increased TC intensity. Given that aerosol emissions in Europe show limited potential for further reduction, future aerosol emissions mitigation in East Asia is expected to intensify VWS over the WNP, thereby dampening the intensification of TC."

Bell,"Chemical characterization of organic vapors from wood, straw, cow dung, and coal burning","Our study analyzes real-time emissions of organic vapors from solid fuel combustion. Using the mass spectrometer, we tested various fuels, finding higher emission factors for organic vapors from wood burning. Intermediate-volatility organic compounds constituted a significant fraction of emissions in solid fuel combustion. Statistical tests identified unique potential markers. Our insights benefit air quality, climate, and health, aiding accurate emission assessments. 
 Solid fuel (SF) combustions, including coal and biomass, are important sources of pollutants in the particle and gas phase and therefore have significant implications for air quality, climate, and human health. In this study, we systematically examined gas-phase emissions, using the Vocus proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight (PTR-TOF) mass spectrometer, from a variety of solid fuels, including beech logs, spruce/pine logs, spruce/pine branches and needles, straw, cow dung, and coal. The average emission factors (EFs) for organic vapors ranged from 4.8 to 74.2 g kg−1, depending on the combustion phases and solid fuel types. Despite slight differences in modified combustion efficiency (MCE) for some experiments, increasing EFs for organic vapors were observed with lower MCE. The relative contribution of different classes showed large similarities between the combustion phases in beech logs stove burning, relative to the large change in EFs observed. The CxHyOz family is the most abundant group of the organic vapor emitted from all SF combustion. However, among these SF combustions, a greater contribution of nitrogen-containing species and CxHy families (related to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) is observed in the organic vapors from cow dung burning and coal burning, respectively. Intermediate-volatility organic compounds (IVOCs) constituted a significant fraction of emissions in solid fuel combustion, ranging from 12.6 % to 39.3 %. This was particularly notable in the combustion of spruce/pine branches and needles (39.3 %) and coal (31.1 %). Using the Mann–Whitney U test on the studied fuels, we identified specific potential new markers for these fuels based on the Vocus measurements. The product from pyrolysis of coniferyl-type lignin and the extract of cedar pine needle were identified as markers in the open burning of spruce/pine branches and needles (e.g., C10H14O2, C11H14O2, C10H10O2). The product (C9H12O) from the pyrolysis of beech lignin was identified as the potential new marker for beech log stove burning. Many series of nitrogen-containing homologues (e.g., C10H11–21NO, C12H11–21N, C11H11–23NO, and C15H15–31N) and nitrogen-containing species (e.g., acetonitrile, acrylonitrile, propanenitrile, methylpentanenitrile) were specifically identified in cow dung burning emissions. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with 9–12 carbons were identified with significantly higher abundance from coal burning compared to emissions from other studied fuels. The composition of these organic vapors reflects the burned solid fuel types and can help constrain emissions of solid fuel burning in regional models."

We found that aerosol variability is influenced by elevation differences, with the most representative site in the region changing seasonally, suggesting aerosol spatial variability also varies seasonally. This work offers a blueprint for future studies in other mountainous regions. 
 In the western US and similar topographic regions across the world, precipitation in the mountains is crucial to local and downstream freshwater supplies. Atmospheric aerosols can impact clouds and precipitation by acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice-nucleating particles (INPs). Previous studies suggest that there is increased aerosol variability in these regions due to their complex terrain, but none of these studies have quantified the extent of this variability. In the fall of 2021, Handix Scientific contributed to the Surface Atmosphere Integrated Field Laboratory (SAIL), funded by the US Department of Energy (DOE) and situated in the East River watershed (ERW; Colorado, USA), by deploying SAIL-Net, a novel network of six aerosol measurement nodes spanning the horizontal and vertical domains of SAIL. The ERW is a topographically diverse region, meaning individual measurement sites can miss important observations of aerosol–cloud interactions. Each measurement node included a small particle counter (the Portable Optical Particle Spectrometer – POPS), a miniature CCN counter (CloudPuck), and a filter sampler (the Time-Resolved Aerosol Particle Sampler – TRAPS) for INP analysis. SAIL-Net studied the spatiotemporal variability in aerosols and the usefulness of dense measurement networks in complex terrain. After the project's completion in the summer of 2023, we analyzed the data to explore these topics. We found increased variability compared to a similar study over flat land. This variability was correlated with the elevation of the sites, and the extent of the variability changed seasonally. These data and analyses serve as a valuable resource for continued research into the role of aerosols in the hydrologic cycle and as the foundation for designing measurement networks in complex terrain."

GEOS-Chem simulations show that anthropogenic nitrogen oxide emission reduction is the dominant driver of ozone–temperature sensitivity decline by influencing both temperature direct and temperature indirect processes. Reduced ozone–temperature sensitivity has decreased ozone enhancement from low to high temperatures by an average of 6.8 ppbv across the US. 
 Ozone–temperature sensitivity is widely used to infer the impact of future climate warming on ozone. However, trends in ozone–temperature sensitivity and possible drivers have remained unclear. Here, we show that the observed summertime surface ozone–temperature sensitivity, defined as the slope of the best-fit line of daily anomalies in ozone versus maximum temperature (mΔO3-ΔTmax), has decreased by 50 % during 1990–2021 in the continental United States (CONUS), with a mean decreasing rate of −0.57 ppbv K−1 per decade (p < 0.01) across 608 monitoring sites. We conduct high-resolution GEOS-Chem simulations in 1995–2017 to interpret the mΔO3-ΔTmax trends and underlying mechanisms in the CONUS. The simulations identify the dominant role of anthropogenic nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission reduction in the observed mΔO3-ΔTmax decrease. We find that approximately 76 % of the simulated decline in mΔO3-ΔTmax can be attributed to the temperature indirect effects arising from the shared collinearity of other meteorological effects (such as humidity, ventilation, and transport) on ozone. The remaining portion (24 %) is mostly due to the temperature direct effects, in particular four explicit temperature-dependent processes, including biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions, soil NOx emissions, dry deposition, and thermal decomposition of peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN). With reduced anthropogenic NOx emissions, the expected ozone enhancement from temperature-driven BVOC emissions, dry deposition, and PAN decomposition decreases, contributing to the decline in mΔO3-ΔTmax. However, soil NOx emissions increase mΔO3-ΔTmax with anthropogenic NOx emission reduction, indicating an increasing role of soil NOx emissions in shaping the ozone–temperature sensitivity. As indicated by the decreased mΔO3-ΔTmax, model simulations estimate that reduced anthropogenic NOx emissions from 1995 to 2017 have lowered ozone enhancement from low to high temperatures by 6.8 ppbv averaged over the CONUS, significantly reducing the risk of extreme-ozone-pollution events under high temperatures. Our study illustrates the dependency of ozone–temperature sensitivity on anthropogenic emission levels, which should be considered in future ozone mitigation in a warmer climate."

As global warming and aridification are projected to increase dust emissions, understanding dust‐high cloud interactions becomes increasingly crucial. However, disentangling dust effects from meteorology influences on high clouds remains challenging. This study employs Principal Component Analysis to derive the first principal component (PC1), a comprehensive indicator that characterizes meteorological conditions dominating high cloud evolution. This allows us to classify atmospheric conditions as weak (characterized by weak updrafts, low humidity, and stable atmosphere), moderate, or favorable (strong updrafts, high humidity, and unstable atmosphere). By strictly constraining both meteorological conditions and ice water path, we establish a framework to isolate dust impacts on high cloud. Our results unveil nonlinear dust‐cloud interactions co‐modulated by meteorology and dust loadings, contrary to previously assumed uniformity. Under weak meteorological conditions, dust impacts vary with loadings: low dust loadings promote larger ice crystals and denser clouds, while high dust levels lead to smaller crystals and thinner clouds. However, under favorable meteorological conditions, dust effects become notably weaker and remain relatively consistent across levels. These findings help explain previously conflicting observations of dust impacts on high clouds and highlight why both meteorological conditions and dust levels must be considered when studying dust‐cloud interactions in a changing climate."

Michel;Shinji Morimoto,Global Fossil Methane Emissions Constrained by Multi‐Isotopic Atmospheric Methane Histories,"The global CH4 budget of sources and sinks is highly uncertain, particularly the emissions from specific sources such as fossil fuels (FF) or agriculture. Here, we estimate plausible global CH4 source and sink scenarios using historical observations and simulations of atmospheric CH4 mole fraction and its stable isotopic (δ13C‐CH4, δD‐CH4) and radiocarbon (Δ14C‐CH4) composition, combining constraints from all these tracers for the first time. We employ a one‐box model along with a Monte Carlo particle filter technique, explicitly exploring the impact of each isotopic constraints and uncertainties in prior CH4 source and sink parameters on posterior sectorial source fractions. We find our posterior anthropogenic FF emissions at the global scale are 30% lower than previous isotope‐based studies. Our analysis suggests previous δ13C‐CH4‐based studies are potentially biased because the current database‐derived estimate of the global mean biogenic δ13C‐CH4 source signature is too low and/or current sink‐weighted total carbon kinetic isotope effect is underestimated. We find modern atmospheric Δ14C‐CH4 data constrains lower global FF emissions after 1980s, which is contrary to the most recent finding that utilized atmospheric Δ14C‐CH4 data, but supported by an independent estimate of global nuclear 14CH4 emissions. Our multi‐isotopic constraints align with CH4‐only inversion results, while reducing their uncertainties with greater robustness against different prior emission scenarios. We find strong constraints not only on FF emissions but also other key sources and sinks, showing that long‐term multi‐isotopic observations are critical for refining the global CH4 budget and developing effective CH4 emission mitigation strategies."

 Land restoration projects, including reforestation and area protection, are being implemented across African drylands such as the Sahel. In addition to biodiversity, livelihood and carbon sequestration benefits, restoration can also affect the local climate through land-atmosphere interaction. Yet, it remains unknown to what extent dryland restoration can affect cloud cover development and, ultimately, precipitation. Here, we use twenty years of high-resolution data from the Meteosat Second Generation satellite to study the impact of land restoration on cloud development in West African drylands. Results show that cloud cover frequency and convective initiation are higher above vegetated areas, particularly during the start and end of the wet seasons. Furthermore, we find a more pronounced cloud cover enhancement over protected areas larger than 121 km2, suggesting a scale-dependent relationship between project size and cloud cover development.

The factors underpinning these variations are unclear. Using the CanESM5 large ensemble, including the single forcing simulations, we find that anthropogenic aerosols played an important role in influencing the above SibH trends on top of pronounced internally-generated variations. Changes in the SibH during both periods are embedded in aerosol-induced upper-tropospheric mid-latitude wave trains propagating from upstream regions, with subsequent downward propagation of the signal to the surface via three-dimensional dynamical adjustments. Further insights into the physical mechanisms using regional aerosol perturbation experiments with CESM1 reveal a dominant role of decreased North American aerosol emissions in driving the atmospheric wave train through interaction with the North Atlantic jet during the first period. In the second period, European aerosol emissions, characterized by a large and extensive decrease, are crucial to explain the SibH recovery. A better understanding of the factors driving multidecadal variability of the SibH, and in particular of the interplay between internal variability and external forcing, is critical to reducing uncertainties in future projections of regional extremes, such as cold surges, which can cause large social and economic impacts on densely populated East Asia."

ROS events can directly alter the physical structure and thermal properties of the snowpack, leading to rapid melting and runoff-induced flooding, reduced snow insulation, and permafrost degradation. However, tracking ROS events and regional trends remain uncertain due to limited ground measurements and lack of long-term satellite ROS observations representing vast and remote boreal-Arctic landscapes. We quantified ROS dynamics over Alaska by developing a daily 6 km resolution ROS record using an established gradient ratio polarization approach and 30 year (1988–2017) satellite observations from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Image Sounder (SSMI/S) sensors. The data record captured well-documented ROS events and showed high consistency (R 0.94) with alternative ROS predictions from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS/2 sensors. Analysis showed an overall increasing ROS frequency with significant trends mainly identified during early winter. Notable rises in ROS frequency were also detected in mid-to-high elevation ranges (>400 m above sea level (ASL)), while this increase diminished at higher elevations (>1000 m ASL). Our analysis further confirmed that the warming climate plays a fundamental role in driving these ROS events, with significantly positive correlations between ROS frequency and air temperature. However, the significant correlations did not extend to the Eastern and Western Gulf climate zones of southern Alaska, where the ROS retrievals were likely affected by coastal ocean contamination of SSMI/S observations."

Grange;Pascal Rubli;Andrea Fischer;Dominik Brunner;Christoph Hueglin;Lukas Emmenegger,The ZiCOS-M CO2 sensor network: measurement performance and CO2 variability across Zurich,"Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a very important atmospheric pollutant, and to better understand the gas's source and sink dynamics, a mid-cost sensor network hosting 26 sites was deployed in and around Zurich, Switzerland. The sensor measurement performance was quantified, and natural and anthropogenic CO2 emission sources were explored with a focus on what drives high CO2 levels. The observations will be used further by others to validate what is thought to be known about CO2 emissions in the region. 
 As a component of the ICOS Cities project, a “mid-cost” NDIR (nondispersive infrared) CO2 sensor network was deployed across the city of Zurich (Switzerland), known as ZiCOS-M. The network was operational between July 2022 and July 2024 and consisted of 26 monitoring sites, 21 of which were located in or around the city of Zurich, with 5 sites outside the urban area. Daily calibrations using two reference gas cylinders and corrections of the sensors' spectroscopic response to water vapour were performed to reach a high level of measurement accuracy. The hourly mean root mean squared error (RMSE) was 0.98 ppm (range of 0.46 and 1.5 ppm) and the mean bias ranged between −0.72 and 0.66 ppm when undergoing parallel measurements with a high-precision reference gas analyser for a period of 2 weeks or more. CO2 concentrations (technically, dry-air mole fractions) were highly variable with site means in Zurich ranging from 434 to 460 ppm, and Zurich's mean urban CO2 dome was 15.4 ppm above the regional background. Some of the highest CO2 levels were found at two sites exposed to strong plant respiration in a very confined nocturnal boundary layer. High-CO2 episodes were detected outside Zurich's urban area, demonstrating that processes acting on a variety of scales drove CO2 levels. The ZiCOS-M network offered significant insights at a cost an order of magnitude lower compared to reference instruments, and the observations generated by ZiCOS-M will be used in additional ICOS Cities activities to conduct CO2 emission inventory validation with inversion modelling systems."

Chipperfield;Justus Notholt,Digitization and calibration of historical solar absorption infrared spectra from the Jungfraujoch site,"During the years 1950 and 1951, Marcel Migeotte took regular solar measurements in the form of paper rolls at the Jungfraujoch site. These historical spectra proved to be valuable for atmospheric research and needed to be saved for posterity. Therefore, a digitization method which used image-processing techniques was developed to extract them from the historical paper rolls. This allowed them to be saved in a machine-readable format that is easily accessible to the scientific community. 
 This study describes the digitization and calibration of historically significant solar absorption spectra recorded at the Jungfraujoch International Scientific Station in the 1950s. Using a homemade Pfund-type grating spectrometer, these spectra were recorded on paper rolls to study the solar spectrum which was then used to compile a solar atlas between 2.8 and 23.7 µm (421 to 3571 cm−1) that, in particular, later contributed to the development of the HITRAN (High-Resolution Transmission Molecular Absorption Database) database. We have now digitized these analogue recorded spectra to make them available for atmospheric studies. Our approach involves image-processing techniques, including colour masking for digitization and peak detection for accurate wavenumber calibration against a synthetic spectrum.We have also developed a validation method by re-digitizing degraded Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra to the same resolution as the old spectra to evaluate the digitization accuracy. Furthermore, we have studied the influence of line thickness on the digitization error.The number of spectra transformed into a machine-readable format is 106 (freely available for download), with an average digitization error of 1.55 % and a wavenumber shift standard deviation of 0.075 cm −1. These digitized and calibrated spectra now offer a valuable resource for atmospheric studies, providing essential historical data for atmospheric research. This work not only helps to preserve scientific heritage but also enhances the utility of historical data in contemporary research."

In this study, we compared two high-resolution gridded estimates of anthropogenic CO2 emissions in Europe for 2019–2021: the near-real-time Global gridded daily CO2 emission data set (GRACED, latest updated version May 2024) and the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service regional inventory (CAMS-REG, v6 for 2019–2020, and v7 for 2021). Total CO2 emissions of the two data sets are comparable, with a 2.4% emission difference, and the total emissions’ spatial determination coefficient (R) at 0.1° is 0.66 in 2021. However, the sectoral emissions and spatial patterns show significant differences. At the grid level, the absolute value of the median of relative percent difference (RPD) of power, ground transportation, and shipping across the domain all reach 200%. CAMS-REG is recommended for fine-scale historical emission analysis in Europe due to its higher spatial resolution and the use of localized data sets. GRACED, with a maximum latency of 3 months, is more appropriate for applications requiring near-real-time data. This work characterizing the difference between two state-of-the-art emission maps is also valuable for atmospheric modelers who need to account for the uncertainty of a priori fossil fuel emissions when performing inverse calculations of land and ocean CO2 sinks."

However, their complex composition, small size, and history-dependent properties result in great uncertainty in the modeling of aerosol phase state and atmospheric processes. Herein, using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), we examined model submicron aerosols composed of organic compounds and ammonium sulfate and established a parametrization for the separation relative humidity (SRH) that accounts for chemical composition, particle size, and equilibration time. We evaluated different variables that describe chemical composition: O/C ratio, partition coefficient, solubility, molar mass, and polarizability. The O/C ratio fits the SRH of micrometer droplets best, and by using a scaling factor to translate the micrometer SRH parametrization to submicron aerosols, we incorporate the effects of size and equilibration time. The measured scaling factor for the submicron mean SRH (30 nm–1 μm, 20 min equilibration times) is 0.80, and the factor becomes 1 with equilibration time over 1 h and is equal to 0, meaning that SRH is absent, when the aerosol dry diameter is smaller than 30 nm. Our parametrization will aid in universal SRH modeling, potentially leading to more accurate predictions of aerosol mass, optical properties, hygroscopicity, and heterogeneous chemistry."

Current global 3‐D atmospheric chemistry models estimate a global warming potential for hydrogen of 12 ± 3 over a 100‐year horizon (GWP‐100), but the models overestimate global OH concentrations and underestimate OH reactivity (OHR). These OH biases cause overestimates of the responses of methane and ozone to hydrogen. Here, we compare the hydrogen GWP‐100 calculated from the standard GEOS‐Chem model and from a modified version where OH and OHR biases are corrected with missing organic emissions and a terminal OH sink over continents. The hydrogen GWP‐100 from the standard GEOS‐Chem model agrees with previous studies, but the modified version is 20% lower. Better understanding of the factors controlling global OH concentrations and OHR is needed to refine hydrogen GWP estimates."

Based on cloud top properties, lightning data and in situ observations of NO, O3 ${\mathrm{O}}_{3}$ and carbon monoxide, we show that deep convection occurs over Northern Australia and the Indo‐Pacific Warm Pool. While we identify strong lightning activity over Australia, we observe deep convection in the Warm Pool that is not electrified. Our observations of low O3 ${\mathrm{O}}_{3}$ in the Warm Pool can be attributed to O3 ${\mathrm{O}}_{3}$‐poor air from the marine boundary layer, which is not replenished by photochemical production from NO at high altitudes."

Unique characteristics of heavy metals and water‐soluble ions have been detected to provide a comprehensive perspective on their presence and behavior within hailstones. 34 hailstone samples were collected from 12 cities in China between 2016 and 2021. Regional differences in heavy metal concentrations between northern and southern China are influenced by anthropogenic pollution sources. Water‐soluble ions are dominated by distant marine aerosol sources. The most notable distinction is that heavy metals display negligible correlation with PM10, whereas water‐soluble ions exhibit a statistically significant relationship. This suggests that chemical components contribute to hailstone formation through diverse pathways. Water‐soluble ions with hygroscopicity primarily act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) to promote the formation of cloud droplets. Heavy metals are barely noticeable when attached to aerosol particles due to random collisions with various hydrometeors."

Woodhouse,Incorporating Eruption Source Parameter and Meteorological Variability in the Generation of Probabilistic Volcanic Ash Hazard Forecasts,"Explosive volcanic eruptions can produce large masses of tephra that are transported over long distances, with potential impacts on the ground and to aircraft. Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers (VAACs) provide advice to aviation following an eruption, using atmospheric dispersion models, initialized with eruption source parameters (ESPs) and driven by forecast meteorological data. In this paper, we develop a framework for producing probabilistic forecasts incorporating uncertainty in these inputs. Meteorological uncertainty is typically provided as an ensemble of numerical weather prediction (NWP) data and ESPs include eruption plume height and mass eruption rate (MER); these are linked by atmospheric processes, and their relationship can be modeled by Bayesian regression to quantify their uncertainties. These uncertainties can be propagated through the model to compute probabilistic quantities of ash concentration. The linearity of the advection‐diffusion‐sedimentation (ADS) equation solved by dispersion models allows us to run a single simulation for each of the NWP ensemble members, and then rescale the results to any combination of MER (or height) and emission profile. This gives a computational speed‐up compared to conventional approaches of computing every combination of ESPs and NWP. We demonstrate our method in the operational setting of the London VAAC, using the UK Met Office's NAME dispersion model, although it can be applied to any eruption scenario using any dispersion model that solves the ADS equation. The major source of uncertainty for this case study arises from the MER (due to limited variation in NWP data), although both sources of uncertainty are significant."

However, natural sources of chlorate are uncertain. Here, we quantify the importance of atmospheric sources of chlorate. We use GEOS‐Chem, a global three‐dimensional chemical transport model, to simulate the formation, photochemical loss, transport, and deposition of atmospheric chlorate on present‐day Earth. We also develop a method to estimate the 17O‐excess (∆17O) and the 36Cl‐to‐total‐Cl ratio (36Cl/Cl) of atmospheric chlorate to interpret the observed isotopic composition of chlorate accumulated in desert soils. The model predicts that gas‐phase chemistry can produce 15 Gg Cl year−1 of chloric acid (HClO3), which predominantly is taken up by aerosols to form particulate chlorate. Comparing the model with observations suggests that particulate chlorate undergoes chemical loss in the atmosphere, which controls the amount reaching Earth's surface. We show that the initial ∆17O that atmospheric chlorate acquires during formation would be erased rapidly in acidic aerosols due to the exchange of oxygen atoms with water. The analysis of 36Cl/Cl does not preclude a partial stratospheric origin for chlorate deposits in the Atacama Desert. In Death Valley, aqueous‐phase oxidation of oxychlorine species and anthropogenic activities potentially have greater influence. Our findings highlight the need for more observations of atmospheric chlorate and laboratory measurements of its reactivity in acidic conditions.

In this study, aerosol samples collected throughout the year from a regional receptor site in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) were analyzed for BB tracers, primary biological aerosol particle (PBAP) tracers, and biogenic secondary organic aerosol tracers. The BB aerosol concentrations were highest from November to January, and this was mainly attributed to domestic biomass burning in southern China. Biomass burning emissions in Southeast Asia affected the PRD through long‐range transport between May and August. Two primary sugar concentration peaks, one in September and October and the other in March, may reflect regional plant phenology, and the constant concentrations for most of the year indicated regional PBAP background emissions. Concentration and correlation analyses indicated that the use of arabitol, erythritol, and inositol as PBAP tracers may not be appropriate because of strong interference by intensive BB emissions. Positive matrix factorization source apportionment showed that plant debris and fungal spores (46%) were the dominant contributors to BB and biogenic organic aerosols (BOAs) during the marine monsoon, but that BB (28%) was the most important contributor during the continental monsoon. The positive matrix factorization results agreed well with the molecular‐level radiocarbon‐based source apportionment results.

However, limited observations of dust particles in the free troposphere hinder our understanding of its spatial distribution and climatic impacts. In this study, aerosols were collected on filters using aircraft over the western North Pacific at 0.2–8 km altitudes in summer 2022. Individual water‐insoluble particles dispersed in water were analyzed using a complex amplitude sensor (CAS), which enabled classifying particle type, sizing, and counting from the particle's complex amplitude data. During the eight observation flights, the number and mass concentrations of dust were 1.2 ± 1.0 cm−3 and 0.6 ± 0.4 μg m−3 (mean ± 1σ), respectively, in the 0.3–2.5 μm diameter range, which were 2–3 orders of magnitude lower than previously reported values near the major dust sources in East Asia. A comparison with the total aerosol data from an optical particle counter onboard aircraft suggested that dust dominated aerosols larger than 0.8 μm, consistent with electron microscopy analyses. The observed dust size distributions implied more efficient removal of larger dust during transport. Since our samples were collected at −18°C to 21°C, the free tropospheric dust could contribute to ice formation in clouds. Our observation using the CAS revealed microphysical properties of dust over the western North Pacific when no distinct Asian dust events were observed near the ground, aiding in the validation of models that assess the climatic impacts of dust."

This paper examines three events (May 16‐23, June 3‐9 and June 17‐30, 2023) during which the composition of smoke was measured over Toronto and Egbert, Ontario. Tropospheric columns (0–10 km) of CO, C2H6, CH3OH, HCN, HCOOH, NH3 and O3 were measured using high‐resolution Fourier transform infrared spectrometers. Coincident enhancements of CO and other gases during the events were used to calculate enhancement ratios. Correlations with CO were observed for C2H6, CH3OH, HCN and HCOOH, but not for NH3 and O3. Plume transport was investigated with the Hybrid Single‐Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model, the GEM‐MACH‐FireWork (GM‐FW) air quality model, and Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) CO satellite data. Additional measurements examined were surface CO, O3, and PM2.5, plume height from a Mini Micro Pulse Lidar, and EM27/SUN XCO columns. GM‐FW model output was compared with ground‐based surface and 0–10 km column measurements, and MOPITT CO maps. Over the 2023 forest fire season (May‐September), the model underestimated background tropospheric columns of CO, NH3 and O3, but generally overestimated enhancements during smoke events. Relative to surface in situ measurements, GM‐FW seasonal averages overestimated CO and underestimated O3 (which was not generally enhanced during smoke events), while PM2.5 fluctuated between a positive and negative bias. Compared to MOPITT, the GM‐FW event‐averaged CO columns appropriately represent plume dispersion across the country, with some offsets on the scale of the ground‐based locations that are consistent with the discussed findings."

Stauffer,Moderate climate sensitivity due to opposing mixed-phase cloud feedbacks,"Moderate climate sensitivity due to opposing mixed-phase cloud feedbacks 
 Earth’s climate sensitivity quantifies the ultimate change in global mean surface air temperature in response to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Recent assessments estimate that Earth’s climate sensitivity very likely lies between 2.3 °C and 4.7 °C, with the representation of clouds in climate models accounting for a large portion of its uncertainty. Here, we adjust the climate sensitivity of individual contemporary climate models after using satellite observations to alleviate biases in their representation of mixed-phase clouds. A resulting moderate average climate sensitivity of 3.63 ± 0.98(1σ) °C arises due to opposing responses of clouds. While increasing the proportion of liquid within cold clouds prior to CO2 doubling increases climate sensitivity via transitions from solid to liquid hydrometeors, a strongly opposing increase in reflective cloud cover decreases climate sensitivity. This emphasizes the need to reconsider the role of mixed-phase cloud cover changes in climate sensitivity assessments."

 Global high-resolution emission inventories of trace gases require refinement to align with ground-based observations, especially for extreme events and changing sources. This study utilizes two satellites to globally quantify NO2 and CO concentrations on daily to weekly scales and estimate emissions with uncertainty bounds, grid-by-grid, for regions with significant variability in 2010. These emissions demonstrate overall increased emissions and identify missing sources compared with various inventories. The NOx and CO emissions are 5.76 × 105–6.25 × 106 Mt/yr and 1.06 × 107–2.78 × 107 Mt/yr, representing a mean 200% and 130% increase. Significant emissions originate from typical and atypical sources, exhibiting short-to-medium-term variability, primarily driven by biomass burning and anthropogenic activities, with substantial redistribution and compression due to long-range transport. The extra CO emissions chemically decay into CO2, resulting in an increase in CO2 mass equivalent to 3.5% of CO2 emissions from Central Africa and 6.1% from Amazon, reflecting the importance of addressing CO from biomass burning."

 PM2.5 samples were collected in Xi'an during the summer and winter of 2019 to analyze seasonal, diurnal, and pollution-level variations in particle chemical composition. Scanning Mobility CCN Analysis was used to investigate the impact of chemical composition on cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation. Results showed increased particle concentrations in winter, with significant rises in SO42−, OM, NO3-, and Cl−. Motor vehicle exhaust was the primary pollution source, while biomass burning air masses further exacerbated winter pollution. Xi'an aerosols exhibited continental characteristics, with κccn = 0.26 ± 0.07 in summer and κccn = 0.33 ± 0.09 in winter. Seasonal κccn differences were mainly attributed to the prevalence of weakly hygroscopic air masses in summer, while higher κccn values were observed in winter and during severe pollution episodes. The κ-closure scheme proposed in this study performed poorly at higher supersaturations (the nucleation mode), with nitrate evaporation losses and the surface tension reduction effect of organics being key factors. A fixed κ-closure scheme could not accurately characterize CCN activity across different seasons, but after appropriate corrections, the closure error was controlled within 6%, achieving a good agreement."

 This study analyzes the role of dust particles on the formation of an anomalous charge structure in a thunderstorm observed on 14 October 2016 around Corsica. The cloud-resolving model Meso-NH with explicit aerosol-microphysics coupling is used to simulate realistically the interactions between the storm and the dust plume. This reference simulation shows no liquid water content in the convective region below −10 °C, which is conducive to only positive charging of the graupel according to traditional liquid water content temperature diagrams of the non-inductive charging mechanism. Differential hydrometeor fall speeds lead to a positive charge region below a negative charge region at the cloud scale, the so-called anomalous charge structure.To disentangle between the radiative and microphysical role of dust particles on cloud structure, additional simulations are performed. First, using a climatological extinction of dust particles over Corsica, the microphysical structure of the storm is similar to the one of the reference simulation, excluding the radiative role of dust particles as a factor controling the charge structure in this case. Secondly, a low, constant and homogeneous ice nuclei particle concentration profile is imposed in the microphysics scheme. It enables the presence of supercooled water at temperatures below −20 °C, allowing the negative charging of the graupel at higher levels of the cloud, and potentially leading to a normal tripole. It highlights the role of desert dust as ice nuclei in the depletion of liquid water content in the mixed phase region of the cloud, which could lead to an anomalous charge structure."

A. Driver;Marc E. J. Stettler;Edward Gryspeerdt,Factors limiting contrail detection in satellite imagery,"Contrails (clouds caused by planes) play a large role in the climate warming caused by aviation. Satellites are a good tool to validate modelled impact estimates. Many contrails are either too narrow or too disperse to detect. This work shows that only around half of contrails are observable but that the most climatically important are easier to detect. It supports the use of satellites for contrail observation but highlights the need for observability considerations for specific applications. 
 Contrails (ice clouds, originally line-shaped after initiation by aircraft exhaust) provide a significant warming contribution to the overall climate impact of aviation. This makes reducing them a key target for future climate strategies in the sector. Identifying pathways for contrail reduction requires accurate models of contrail formation and life cycle, which in turn need suitable observations to constrain them. Infrared imagers on geostationary satellites provide widespread contrail observations, with sufficient time resolution to observe the evolution of their properties. However, contrails are often narrow and optically thin, which makes them challenging for satellites to identify. Quantifying the impact of contrail properties on observability is essential to determine the extent to which satellite observations can be used to constrain contrail models and to assess the climate impact of aviation.In this work, contrail observability is tested by applying a simple contrail detection algorithm to synthetic images of linear contrails in an otherwise clear sky against a homogeneous ocean background. Only (46±2) % of a modelled population of global contrail segments is found to be observable using current 2 km resolution satellite-borne imagers, even in this maximally observable case. By estimating the radiative forcing of individually modelled contrails, it is found that a significantly higher portion of contrail forcing is detectable using the same 2 km resolution imager – (72±2) % of instantaneous long-wave (LW) forcing – because more easily observable contrails have a larger climate impact. This detection efficiency could be partly improved by using a higher-resolution infrared imager, which would also allow contrails to be detected earlier in their life cycle. However, even this instrument would still miss the large fraction of contrails that are too optically thin to be detected.These results support the use of contrail detection and lifetime observations from existing satellite imagers to draw conclusions about the relative radiative importance of different contrails under near-ideal conditions. However, there is a highlighted need to assess the observability of contrails where the observation conditions may vary by application. These observability factors are shown to change in response to climate action, demonstrating a need to consider the properties of the observing system when assessing the impacts of proposed mitigation strategies."

Using the instruments aboard the ExoMars‐TGO and Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft, we show that the primary emission peak (75–80 km) remains unaffected during ICME events compared to quiet‐times. However, an enhancement has been observed in the brightness of the secondary emission peak (110–120 km) and the upper altitude region (140–180 km). The enhancement is attributed to the increased solar electrons, X‐ray fluxes and Solar Energetic Particles, augmenting the electron‐impact processes causing the enhancement in the brightness.

Due to limited measurements, the physical characteristics of OOS aerosols under high relative humidity (RH) and subsequent cloud activation potential remain unclear. In this study, we measured phase state, surface tension and morphology of mixtures containing inorganic salts (sodium chloride (NaCl) and ammonium salfate (AS)) and OOS under high RH (>99.5%), and investigated their cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity. We found that the κCCN of the studied OOS ranged from 0.15 to 0.37, showing a negative relationship with molar volume. κCCN and chemistry‐derived κChem agreed well for mixtures containing OOS with short carbon chain length (≤4), which could be explained by the ideal solution because of the liquid phase and slight surface tension reduction compared to that of water. However, κChem overpredicted κCCN by 35% and 17% on average for NaCl–OOS and AS–OOS with long carbon chain length (seven and eight), respectively, which was the opposite of results from inorganic–dicarboxylic acid mixtures we previously reported. Although surface tension notably decreased by 25%–44%, inorganic–OOS mixtures exhibited core‐shell morphology and the OOS shell suppressed water uptake, whereas inorganic–dicarboxylic acid particles exhibited homogeneous state thus not inhibiting water uptake. Based on the results, we emphasize the pivotal role of surfactant in determining aerosol morphology and thereby CCN activations."

We found that the dynamic dust source in East Asia in 2001–2020 demonstrates a pronounced monthly and annual variability, showing wider spatial distribution in March than that in July and lower probability of dust uplifting in summer than that in spring. The dust source functions of the Gobi Desert and Taklimakan Desert decrease at rates of 5.8 × 10−3 and 4.7 × 10−3 decade−1, respectively. Using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry, we further assess the joint control of surface bareness and topographical depression feature on the spatial distribution and value of the dynamic dust source. The East Asian dust source function generally increases with increasing surface bareness threshold, whereas that in the western Taklimakan Desert and central Gobi Desert decreases with coarse topography calculation resolution.

Seven PM10 stations were used to evaluate the changes in PM10 concentrations over different time intervals (10‐min, hourly, and daily).

The findings of this study demonstrated that the traditional methods that use daily or hourly averages underestimate the atmospheric PM10 concentrations during short convective dust events and therefore lower the estimated exposure.

 The Antarctic ozone ‘hole’ was discovered in 1985 (ref. 1) and man-made ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) are its primary cause2. Following reductions of ODSs under the Montreal Protocol3, signs of ozone recovery have been reported, based largely on observations and broad yet compelling model–data comparisons4. Although such approaches are highly valuable, they do not provide rigorous statistical detection of the temporal and spatial structure of Antarctic ozone recovery in the presence of internal climate variability. Here we apply pattern-based detection and attribution methods as used in climate-change studies5–11 to separate anthropogenically forced ozone responses from internal variability, relying on trend pattern information as a function of month and height. The analysis uses satellite observations together with single-model and multi-model ensemble simulations to identify and quantify the month–height Antarctic ozone recovery ‘fingerprint’12. We demonstrate that the data and simulations show compelling agreement in the fingerprint pattern of the ozone response to decreasing ODSs since 2005. We also show that ODS forcing has enhanced ozone internal variability during the austral spring, influencing detection of forced responses and their time of emergence. Our results provide robust statistical and physical evidence that actions taken under the Montreal Protocol to reduce ODSs are indeed resulting in the beginning of Antarctic ozone recovery, defined as increases in ozone consistent with expected month–height patterns.

 Equivalent black carbon mass concentrations were measured using a portable Aethalometer (MicroAeth AE51, eBCAE51) and evaluated against refractory BC measurement obtained from a Single-Particle Soot Photometer (SP2, rBCSP2). Correction methods were proposed to improve AE51 measurements by considering the non-linearity of light attenuation (ATN) due to the accumulation of BC particles (i.e., rBC loading effect) and the interference in ATN measurements caused by non-refractory BC particles (i.e., non-BC loading effect). First, a catalytic stripper was used to heat the sampling line to 350 °C, minimizing the impact of non-BC sampling. This allowed for the correction of the non-linearity of ATN due to the rBC loading effect. After applying the correction formula derived from this process to the measured eBCAE51, further correction was applied to account for the filter loading effect of non-BC, estimated from atmospheric measurements through an unheated sampling line. This study introduces an innovative system for accurately quantifying high-resolution vertical profiles of BC mass concentration. By combining data from the AE51 and a miniaturized optical particle counter, the system applies precise corrections to enhance measurement accuracy at various altitudes.

 Although air quality has improved in Europe, most of its population is still exposed to levels of pollutants that are harmful to health, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) or sulphur dioxide (SO2). Studying the processes that drive atmospheric chemistry is key to understanding their contribution to air quality. However, since many pollutants are secondary, since meteorology influences the chemical evolution of pollutants, disperses them and transport them and their precursors, among other factors, this task is extremely difficult. This makes thus the use of models essential for the study of air quality. In this work, we present the first long-term validation of air quality simulations in Central Europe for the 2010–2019 decade. The simulations were carried out using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) and the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx). Using the AirBase dataset, stations inside the model domain were classified into three categories according to their pollution burden, and the validation of the models was performed independently in each group. Our research shows that, generally, simulations underestimate pollutant concentrations – except ozone (O3) – most likely because of an incorrect monthly and hourly emissions profile and an overestimation of vertical mixing."

Since the SP2 records individual particle signals, it requires complex data processing to convert raw signals into particle size and mixing states. Furthermore, the rapid accumulation of substantial data volumes impedes real-time analysis of BC mixing states. This study employs the Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM), an advanced tree-based ensemble learning algorithm, to establish an inversion model that directly correlates SP2 signals with the mixing state of BC-containing particles. Our model achieves high accuracy for both particle size inversion and optical cross-section inversion of BC-containing particles, with a coefficient of determination R2 higher than 0.98. We further employ the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method to analyze the importance of input features from SP2 signals in the inversion model of the entire particle diameter (Dp) and explore their underlying physical significance. Compared to the widely used leading-edge-only (LEO) fitting method, the machine learning (ML) method utilizes a larger coverage of signals encompassing the peak of scattering signal rather than the leading-edge data. This allows for more accurate capture of the diverse characteristics of particles. Moreover, the ML method uses signals with a high signal-to-noise ratio, providing better noise resistance. Our model is capable of accurately and efficiently acquiring the single-particle information and statistical results of the BC mixing state, which provides essential data for BC aging mechanism investigation and the assessment of further BC radiative effects."

We measured atmospheric gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) concentrations and stable Hg isotopes at fine spatial resolution in the Madre de Dios region of Peru, where ASGM is a major source of Hg. This study employed new passive air samplers that overcome logistical challenges in measuring atmospheric Hg in remote locations. Regional GEM concentrations were elevated (∼1.3 to 11 ng m–3) compared to the background (<1 ng m–3), with very high GEM levels (∼10 to >5000 ng m–3) associated with mining areas and gold shops. Because ASGM-derived GEM is isotopically distinct, its contribution to regional and local atmospheric Hg was estimated using an isotope mixing model and found to be generally over 70%. We also show that vegetation is taking up ASGM-derived GEM, affecting both the concentrations and isotope compositions of GEM as well as in foliage and litter samples. This supports vegetation uptake as a key removal process of GEM from the atmosphere and therefore a major source of Hg to terrestrial ecosystems and soils, which is heightened in ASGM regions."

However, these sensors are highly sensitive to environmental conditions, including temperature and humidity, which can significantly affect detection accuracy. This study characterizes the effects of these conditions and applies machine learning models to correct signal biases caused by multiple environmental factors. Experiments simulating natural environmental conditions for CH4 monitoring were conducted in the laboratory across a temperature range of 10–40 °C, relative humidity levels of 10–70%, and CO2 concentrations ranging from 0 to 1000 ppm, revealing significant signal variability under these conditions. The simulations and their results were comprehensively validated at the Ito Natural Analogue Site (INAS), a real-world field-testing location dedicated to investigating environmental impacts. Using machine learning regression algorithms for comprehensive compensation of environmental influences, we successfully mitigated signal biases caused by environmental factors. This offers a cost-effective solution for improving detection accuracy and reliability while reducing system complexity and operational costs."

We develop an ambient HCHO exposure data set to assess the long-term changes in exposure and to calculate the potential HCHO-related cancer risks in India. We estimate the long-term mean (2005–2019) annual 24-h average surface HCHO concentrations at a spatial resolution of 0.1° × 0.1° (latitude × longitude) over India by scaling the HCHO vertical column density retrievals from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite sensor with the atmospheric profile information from the MERRA2 GMI chemical transport model. We find an increase in long-term HCHO exposure of >0.05 ppb (parts per billion by volume) for most Indian states (2015–2019 annual mean compared to 2005–2009 mean). The OMI-based estimate shows that the Indian population of 40,000–76,000 will likely be under enhanced cancer risk due to exposure to long-term ambient HCHO. We find highest HCHO exposure values for rural regions compared to urban areas in most Indian states except Delhi national capital region. This study shows that HCHO pollution in India is a regional-centric issue. Therefore, emission mitigation policies should focus on reducing HCHO in both urban and rural regions."

 Biogenic hydrocarbons, sea salt and dust emissions are driven by meteorological variables, which will change in a future climate. Natural emissions can dominate air quality in Australia, particularly when high biogenic activity promotes smog formation in summer. Therefore, quantifying how natural emissions might change is important. This study uses 4 downscaled Global Climate Models (GCMs) under 2 shared socioeconomic pathways in the 2050s to drive natural emissions at 20 km spatial resolution in the CSIRO Chemical Transport Model. Changes in air quality parameters were calculated by comparing each 5-year future run to a 5-year run from the current period. Higher urban air mass stagnancy was predicted in winter. When combined with lower rainfall increased particle residence time is expected. By contrast, higher ventilation indices were predicted in summer. Higher wind speeds in the ocean facilitated additional sea salt emissions. As Australian cities are largely coastal, sea salt contributed ∼35% of the1-2 μg m−3 extra coarse particulate matter predicted. Peak summertime isoprene emissions are set to double in 2050, by 3–4 mg m−2 h−1 in eastern Australia. This produced 3–6 ppb additional ozone in Australian cities already at air quality limits. Monoterpene emissions increased in 2050, but cooler night-time minimum temperatures led to decreased emissions in some GCMs. A reduced summertime oxidant capacity in Australian cities is likely driven by higher biogenic emissions. The lifetime of methane will increase by half a year in response, causing a warming feedback warranting further study using models with free running oxidant schemes."

A significant latitudinal gradient in NH4+ concentration was observed, and NH4+ was mainly in the fine-mode (<2.1 μm) in the MBL. NH4+ showed the highest concentration in the coastal East Asia (CEA), followed by the coastal Southeast Asia and Australia (CSAA). Low NH4+ levels were detected in the open oceans, i.e. the Arctic Ocean (AO), the Southern Ocean (SO), and the Western Pacific Ocean (WPO). In the AO, WPO, and SO regions, the air masses arriving at the sampling sites mainly originated from the open oceans, and the significant correlation between methanesulfonate (MSA), which is considered a marker of marine biogenic sources, and NH4+ suggests that marine emissions associated with marine primary productivity are likely an important source of NH4+. However, in the two near-continental regions of CEA and CSAA, elevated NH4+ concentrations are mainly dominated by dense human activities associated with continental air masses. The Neutralization Ratio, defined as the extent to which acidic sulfate and nitrate compounds are neutralized by NH4+, was much smaller than 1.0 (mean = 0.07) in all samples, indicating that the transformation and generation of NH4+ are mainly controlled by the source (i.e. NH3 levels). In addition, there was a significant correlation between non-sea-salt sulfate (nssSO42−) and NH4+, suggesting that NH3 preferentially reacted with H2SO4 over HNO3 in the MBL, especially in areas with excessive acidity."

The Sixth Phase of Coupled Intercomparison Model Project (CMIP6) models tend to overestimate total gaseous N emissions and thus N2O emissions.

Differences in gas partitioning models also contribute significantly to uncertainties in N2O emission estimates. This study underscores the need for improved modeling of gaseous N emissions and partitioning in CMIP6 models to better understand the responses and feedbacks of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change."

 Knowledge of humidity in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) is of special interest due to its importance for cirrus cloud formation and its climate impact. However, the UTLS water vapor distribution in current weather models is subject to large uncertainties. Here, we develop a dynamic-based humidity correction method using an artificial neural network (ANN) to improve the relative humidity over ice (RHi) in ECMWF numerical weather predictions. The model is trained with time-dependent thermodynamic and dynamical variables from ECMWF ERA5 and humidity measurements from the In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System (IAGOS). Previous and current atmospheric variables within ±2 ERA5 pressure layers around the IAGOS flight altitude are used for ANN training. RHi, temperature, and geopotential exhibit the highest impact on ANN results, while other dynamical variables are of low to moderate or high importance. The ANN shows excellent performance, and the predicted RHi in the UT has a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.7 % and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.95, which is significantly improved compared to ERA5 RHi (MAE of 15.8 %; R2 of 0.66). The ANN model also improves the prediction skill for all-sky UT/LS and cloudy UTLS and removes the peak at RHi = 100 %. The contrail predictions are in better agreement with Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) observations of ice optical thickness than the results without humidity correction for a contrail cirrus scene over the Atlantic. The ANN method can be applied to other weather models to improve humidity predictions and to support aviation and climate research applications."

Simpson,"Surface distributions and vertical profiles of trace gases (CO, O3, NO, NO2) in the Arctic wintertime boundary layer using low-cost sensors during ALPACA-2022","The Fairbanks area experiences severe pollution episodes in winter because of enhanced emissions of pollutants trapped near the surface by strong temperature inversions. Low-cost sensors were deployed on board a car and a tethered balloon to measure the concentrations of gaseous pollutants (CO, O3, and NOx) in Fairbanks during winter 2022. Data calibration with reference measurements and machine learning methods enabled us to document pollution at the surface and power plant plumes aloft. 
 Electrochemical gas sensors (EGSs) have been used to measure the surface distributions and vertical profiles of trace gases in the wintertime Arctic boundary layer during the Alaskan Layered Pollution and Chemical Analysis (ALPACA) field experiment in Fairbanks, Alaska, in January–February 2022. The MICRO sensors for MEasurements of GASes (MICROMEGAS) instrument set up with CO, NO, NO2, and O3 EGSs was operated on the ground at an outdoor reference site in downtown Fairbanks for calibration, while on board a vehicle moving through the city and its surroundings and on board a tethered balloon, the helikite, at a site at the edge of the city. To calibrate the measurements, a set of machine learning (ML) calibration methods were tested. For each method, learning and prediction were performed with coincident MICROMEGAS and reference analyser measurements at the downtown site. For CO, the calibration parameters provided by the manufacturer led to the best agreement between the EGS and the reference analyser, and no ML method was needed for calibration. The Pearson correlation coefficient R is 0.82, and the slope of the linear regression between MICROMEGAS and reference data is 1.12. The mean bias is not significant, but the root mean square error (290 ppbv, parts per billion by volume) is rather large because of CO concentrations reaching several ppmv (parts per million by volume) in downtown Fairbanks. For NO, NO2, and O3, the best agreements for the prediction datasets were obtained with an artificial neural network, the multi-layer perceptron. For these three gases, the correlation coefficients are higher than 0.95, and the slopes of linear regressions with the reference data are in the range 0.93–1.04. The mean biases, which are 1 ± 3, 0 ± 4, and 3 ± 12 ppbv for NO2, O3, and NO, respectively, are not significant. Measurements from the car round of 21 January are presented to highlight the ability of MICROMEGAS to quantify the surface variability in the target trace gases in Fairbanks and the surrounding hills. MICROMEGAS flew 11 times from the ground up to a maximum of 350 m above ground level (a.g.l.) on board the helikite at the site at the edge of the city. The statistics performed over the helikite MICROMEGAS dataset show that the median vertical gas profiles are characterized by almost constant mixing ratios. The median values over the vertical are 140, 8, 4, and 32 ppbv for CO, NO, NO2, and O3. Extreme values are detected with low-O3 and high-NO2 and NO concentrations between 100 and 150 m a.g.l. O3 minimum levels (5th percentile) of 5 ppbv are coincident with NO2 maximum levels (95th percentile) of 40 ppbv, which occur around 200 m a.g.l. The peaks aloft are linked to pollution plumes originating from Fairbanks power plants such as those documented during the flight on 20 February."

PWV retrievals utilized weighted mean temperature (Tm) and zenith hydrostatic delay (ZHD) derived from fifth-generation European ReAnalysis (ERA5) products. After rigorous quality control, the dataset achieved an average completeness rate of 70 %. Validation against ERA5 PWV products showed strong agreement (mean bias: 0.80 mm; RMS error: 2.52 mm), while comparisons with radiosonde profiles yielded a mean bias of 0.90 mm and an RMS error of 3.01 mm, confirming its accuracy and reliability. Spatial analysis revealed PWV values ranging from 0 to 88.57 mm, with minima decreasing with increasing latitude and concentrated around the Yangtze River estuary. Temporal patterns exhibited prominent annual and semi-annual cycles, particularly in higher latitudes. PWV showed a strong positive correlation with sea surface temperature (SST; r = 0.76), with a 1 K SST increase leading to a 2.4 mm (7 %) PWV rise.

Acid uptake during the transport of Fe-containing particles has been shown to cause Fe dissolution. However, carbonate in dust particles affects the Fe acidification process, influencing Fe dissolution. Here, we carried out atmospheric observations and modeling to show that Fe solubility substantially increased from locations near dust sources to downwind regions in aged dust particles with pH > 3, driven by proton-promoted dissolution. We found that Fe solubility remained low when Ca solubility was under 45 ± 5%, but increased with Ca solubility when it was above 45 ± 5%. Moreover, we found that Fe dissolved in aqueous Ca-nitrate coatings on Fe-containing dust particles. Our results suggest that the mixing state and buffering capacity of carbonate and Fe minerals should be represented in atmospheric biogeochemical models to more accurately simulate acid Fe dissolution processes."

Evaluating BC’s impacts by model simulation requires an understanding of the distribution of other aerosol species between those containing BC and those free of BC particles during the atmospheric aging process. Previous studies observed a large variability in the mass fraction of BC-containing particles in PM2.5 (FBC-containing), complicating the determination of their impacts. In this work, we conducted field observations in various polluted environments across China for process-level understanding of FBC-containing. We find that the variability in FBC-containing, ranging from 10 to 90%, can be elucidated by the concept of atmospheric oxidation capacity (AOC). The contrast between observations of FBC-containing during haze events is determined by whether the initial aging of freshly emitted BC is limited by daytime AOC levels.

In current emission inventories, postfertilization soil emissions are poorly characterized due to inaccurate identification of fertilization timing and location. Moreover, pre-existing studies predominantly focus on individual Nr gases, and a comprehensive understanding of simultaneously emitted Nr gases from fertilization and their impacts on air quality is still limited. Here, we developed a novel method to identify the dryland fertilization activity based on satellite and reanalysis data sets. Then, we updated a dynamic soil Nr emissions model (WRF-SoilN-Chem) with lab-derived parametrization and applied it to analyze the time- and space-varying Nr emissions and their effects on air quality. It is estimated that the Nr emissions from a typical fertilization event in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region increased ozone (O3) and nitrate concentrations by 2.5 and 18.2%, respectively. HONO and NH3 emissions jointly enhanced nitrate production via gas–particle partitioning. An accurate representation of fertilization and meteorology–emission–chemistry coupled modeling would greatly improve the understanding of the soil Nr emissions and their impacts on regional air pollution."

China is the largest emitter of NH3 globally, with the dynamic inventory of NH3 emissions remaining uncertain. Here, we use the second national agricultural pollution source censuses, integrated satellite data, 15N isotope source apportionment, and multiple models to better understand those key features of NH3 emissions and its environmental impacts in China. Our results show that the total NH3 emissions were estimated to be 11.2 ± 1.1 million tonnes in 2020, with three emission peaks in April, June, and October, primarily driven by agricultural sources, which contributed 74% of the total emissions. Furthermore, employing a series of quantitative analyses, we estimated the contribution of NH3 emissions to ecosystem impacts. The NH3 emissions have contributed approximately 22% to secondary PM2.5 formation and a 16.6% increase in nitrogen loading of surface waters, while ammonium deposition led to a decrease in soil pH by 0.0032 units and an increase in the terrestrial carbon sink by 44.6 million tonnes in 2020.

Machine learning analysis identified Cl2, O3, nitrate, temperature, and iron as the primary factors affecting HOCl distribution. Beyond Cl2 photolysis, both nitrate photolysis and aerosol iron photochemistry also contributed to Cl radical production, which drove daytime HOCl production through reactions involving ClO and HO2 radicals in the presence of O3. Both OH and Cl radicals released via HOCl photolysis increased the levels of ROx radicals by ∼10%, thereby enhancing the daytime O3 generation and atmospheric oxidation capacity. Our findings emphasize the significant role of HOCl in atmospheric chemistry and suggest that controlling O3 levels could alleviate Cl radical production and its adverse impacts on air quality."

 Controlling ammonia (NH3) emissions through agricultural management has been recognized as effectively mitigating fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution in eastern China. However, agricultural nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions are often overlooked. Here we estimate agricultural NOx emissions and design a set of atmospheric chemistry model experiments to assess their role in present and future PM2.5 pollution mitigation in eastern China. The results show that when fossil fuel emissions decrease to 2060 levels, the contribution of agricultural NOx emissions to secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) concentrations during the crop-growing season will reach 40% over intensive agricultural areas such as North China Plain, and the efficiency of reducing agricultural NOx emissions in mitigating SIAs will become comparable to reducing NH3 emissions. By estimating the optimal reactive nitrogen (Nr) emission control pathway, we find that when including agricultural NOx emissions, the strategies will shift in favor of controlling agricultural Nr emissions to achieve more efficient PM2.5 mitigation. Such additional benefits of agricultural nitrogen management should be considered when designing future air quality strategies for agricultural-intensive regions."

 With several cities worldwide pursuing carbon neutrality in the upcoming decades, there is an increasing interest in quantifying cities’ anthropogenic carbon emissions using atmospheric observations. The challenge with both in-situ and remote sensing methods is, however, that the observations include both anthropogenic and biogenic signals. To reduce uncertainties in anthropogenic emission estimations, it is critical to partition biogenic fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the observed data. In this study, we, for the first time, examine the suitability of carbonyl sulfide (COS), a proxy for photosynthesis, on partitioning biogenic CO2 uptake from the ecosystem exchange measured with the eddy covariance (EC) technique over an urban area in Helsinki, Finland. The urban vegetation acts as a clear sink for COS whereas anthropogenic processes show minimal COS emissions within the source area of the measured net carbon flux. We show that two different COS flux-based methods are able to produce the dynamics of photosynthesis by an independent light-response curve-based estimation. Together with commonly used soil and vegetation respiration proxy, we removed biogenic signals from the urban net CO2 exchange and demonstrated that together with CO2 fluxes, COS flux can successfully be used to get realistic estimations of anthropogenic carbon emissions using the EC method."

 In 2020, the Fine Particle Research Initiative in East Asia considering National Differences (FRIEND) project was launched to understand air quality issues over Northeast Asia better. In the FRIEND project, high-temporal-resolution measurements of gas and aerosol concentrations were taken simultaneously at five key sites in Northeast Asia. In this study, we used the dataset at Beijing in China, Seoul in Republic of Korea, and Noto in Japan. The second FRIEND campaign was conducted in early summer from June 1 to 30, 2021. Compared with the results of the first FRIEND campaign conducted in winter, it was revealed that the fraction of sulfate aerosol (SO42−) had dramatically increased in the upwind region of Northeast Asia (Beijing and Seoul). This period corresponds to the early rainy season in Northeast Asia; therefore, the role of the aqueous-phase oxidation process could be increased in SO42− production. However, accurate modeling of precipitation is still challenging because of the parameterization in the meteorological model. Thus, we investigated the microphysics and cumulus schemes in the meteorological model and conducted 10 simulations. All schemes underestimated the precipitation amount and the cloud fraction. Hence, SO42− concentration was underestimated with a lower conversion ratio from sulfur dioxide (SO2) to SO42− (FS) at Beijing, Seoul, and Noto. At Seoul, the SO42− concentration was underestimated with the aerosol ion monitor (AIM) measurements, corresponding to PM2.5, but had an acceptable performance level. The SO42− concentration at Seoul was sensitive to microphysics and cumulus schemes. However, the SO42− concentration was compared with aerosol chemical speciation monitors (ACSMs), corresponding to PM1.0, in Beijing and Noto, and showed greater underestimation. The sensitivities of SO42− concentration to the precipitation schemes were small at Beijing and Noto. The simulated aerosol diameter shifted to a coarser range (1–2.5 μm) in the second campaign compared with the first campaign dataset with increasing temperature and relative humidity. The international measurement network in the FRIEND project demonstrates that the modeled aerosol diameter treatment must be revised carefully."

 Global warming and subsequent climate change are currently a major issue both in the scientific community and the society. Therefore it is highly important to consistently monitor the concentrations of greenhouse gases that affect the incoming-outgoing energy balance. To that end, a portable Bruker EM27/SUN FTIR spectrometer is operated in Thessaloniki, Greece since January 2019, performing measurements of total column-averaged dry air mole fractions of trace gases, denoted as X-gases. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of available measurements of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to identify the origin of enhanced concentrations. Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) reanalysis data are used synergetically with FTIR measurements. XCO2 shows an obvious annual increase (over 2.2 ppm per year) and a clear seasonal variation with high increased concentrations during cold season and decreased concentration during summer period due to photosynthesis activity. XCH4 shows an annual increase and a positive trend. The continuous fire episodes in Athens and North Evia during July and August 2021 led to an unprecedented increase in the concentrations of CO of over 130 %, compared to the typical averaged mean values during August in Thessaloniki. In this paper we investigate the seasonal dependency between CO-CO2 and CO-CH4 enhancements with respect to the prevailing wind direction and we examine if meteorological parameters, such as wind direction and speed, could reveal the origin of enhanced X-gas variations. We applied two different approaching methods to detect long-term and short-term signals of the trace gases. In general, concerning the FTIR measurements, during summer and autumn XCO2, XCO and XCH4 enhancements are observed for low and medium speed winds. Winds mainly originating from SW directions have transported large amounts of CO2, CO and CH4 from the big fires near Athens and N. Evia in summer 2021 to Thessaloniki. The fire emissions generate higher variability of the columns of target gases (over 0.022 ppm in the S and SW wind direction)."

By deriving a classical nucleation theory-based parametrization of these polysaccharidic INMs and applying it to global model simulations, a comparison to currently available marine atmospheric INP observations demonstrates a 44% contribution of polysaccharides to the total INPs of marine origin within −15 to −20 °C.

This study analyzed the seasonal variations of CO over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) using surface and satellite observations, focusing on the impact of transport processes on the three‐dimensional distribution of CO across the TP and surrounding regions. Unlike regions with significant surface emissions, the TP exhibited opposing seasonal patterns and a negative correlation between surface CO and CO total columns (COTC). Surface CO peaked in winter/spring, while COTC peaked in summer, due to different contributions of transport processes at various altitudes. CO from tropical biomass burning was transported up and north by the Hadley circulation, increasing CO concentrations with altitude over the TP, except for winter, when CO stayed uniform within the troposphere, indicating seasonal variations in transport. During winter/spring, downdrafts transported high CO concentrations to the lower troposphere, where it was efficiently removed by strong winter westerlies. In summer/autumn, strong convection lifted surface CO from India and Southeast Asia into the upper troposphere over the TP. These findings indicated that high COTC over the TP and other regions influenced by similar circulations should not be misinterpreted as surface air pollution. Furthermore, using low CO as an indicator of stratospheric intrusion as in current studies might be unsuitable for tropical/subtropical regions where CO was elevated near the tropopause. Future research should further explore these transport mechanisms and their broader implications for atmospheric chemistry and climate dynamics over the TP."

 While air pollution from most U.S. sources has decreased, emissions from wildland fires have risen. Here, we use an integrated assessment model to estimate that wildfire and prescribed burn smoke caused $200 billion in health damages in 2017, associated with 20,000 premature deaths. Nearly half of this damage came from wildfires, predominantly in the West, with the remainder from prescribed burns, mostly in the Southeast. Our analysis reveals positive correlations between smoke exposure and various social vulnerability measures; however, when also considering smoke susceptibility, these disparities are systematically influenced by age. Senior citizens, who are disproportionately White, represented 16% of the population but incurred 75% of the damages. Nonetheless, within most age groups, Native American and Black communities experienced the greatest damages per capita. Our work highlights the extraordinary and disproportionate effects of the growing threat of fire smoke and calls for targeted, equitable policy solutions for a healthier future.

Our tests show that by considering source limitation, the model predicted dust emission can reduce by one order of magnitude in a real‐case simulation period of less than 20 days. We show that the process of dust emission is much more complex and variable than considered in previous dust models. Our findings have far‐reaching implications, for example, to the global dust emission estimates.

Due to the lack of vertical profiling of cloud water, previous studies on the vertical variability of fad within clouds have been confined to single cloud scales. Our prior research achieved a breakthrough in the large‐scale retrieval of cloud adiabatic fraction, while it only provided two‐dimensional information on the adiabatic fraction, leaving the vertical variation of the in‐cloud adiabatic fraction unquantified. In this study, utilizing global‐scale cloud fad data derived from our previous research, we developed a predictive function for global marine low‐cloud fad based on cloud geometric thickness and cloud base temperature (CBT). This enabled us to successfully estimate the vertical distributions of fad within clouds across various temperature conditions on a global scale. The fad within clouds exhibits a quadratic reduction from the cloud base to the top, which is more pronounced at higher temperatures. Specifically, as the CBT rises from 2 to 24°C, the fad at cloud base diminishes from 0.85 to 0.23. The decreasing trend of fad within clouds with increasing temperatures is expected to reduce cloud albedo and coverage potentially constituting a positive radiative cloud feedback mechanism."

Despite the increase in spaceborne and ground‐based concentration measurements, atmospheric inversions are usually limited by uncertainties in chemical transport models (CTMs) when relating fluxes to observed CO2 mole fractions. CO2 eddy covariance (EC) flux measurements have been widely used to directly measure CO2 fluxes over various ecosystems, but they have rarely been used as constraints in top‐down estimations. In this study, we focused on the development of a novel fluxes assimilation scheme through direct flux observations within an Ensemble Square Root Filter assimilation framework. The assimilation scheme avoided some of complexities of concentration observation assimilations. The methodology was primarily applied to typical regions in west China, taking advantage of eight long‐term ecosystem EC sites. Moreover, four sets of assimilation experiments were designed to quantify the impacts of observational constraints by flux and concentration measurements. Generally, results indicate that the monthly and hourly statistics of the a posteriori fluxes constrained by flux observations agreed well with flux measurements, demonstrating reasonable performance in seasonal and diurnal variations. Specifically, assimilation results demonstrated the advantage of a posteriori estimates inferred from flux measurements during growing season, as compared to results inferred from concentrations, while some limitation still exists in monthly budget estimates. Nevertheless, it is important to note that current results are only a mathematical optimum. CO2 biospheric fluxes can be estimated more reliably and robustly at the regional scale given considerably more flux observations for efficient constraint."

 Heterogeneous dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) is an important reactive intermediate in the atmospheric nighttime oxidization of nitrogen oxides and in the formation of nitrate (NO3−) aerosols. However, vertical profiles of N2O5-related chemical species over Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) are currently lacking. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting-Community Multiscale Air Quality (WRF-CMAQ) model was employed and simulated vertical profiles of nighttime N2O5-related chemical species to facilitate aircraft-based campaigns over the SMA. The vertical structures of the NO3 radical (NO3•) and N2O5 were assessed during the meteorologically stagnant period (March 16–17, 2016), which was a typical period of nighttime N2O5-driven NO3− formation in the study region. The results showed that nighttime vertical structures exhibiting higher concentrations of N2O5-related chemical species were strongly associated with the nocturnal residual layer (RL), which was decoupled from the ground. Our model showed diminished nighttime NO3• at the ground but active NO3• aloft, as it was retained in the RL. We also carried out the same analysis for the stagnant period (May 16–22, 2016) during the KORUS-AQ campaign, and confirmed the similar profiles of high concentration of NO3• near the altitude of RL. To sum up the cases from this study and KORUS-AQ campaign study, maximum nighttime NO3• and N2O5 concentrations occurred at heights of 78 ± 11% of RL height and 54 ± 15% of RL height, respectively. Although further research on nighttime N2O5 chemistry is needed to resolve outstanding uncertainties, the vertical structures of nighttime N2O5-related chemical species obtained in this study offer useful reference data for future aircraft campaigns."

Natural ozone variability complicates the detection of small trends. This study optimizes a statistical model fit in ground-station-based observational records by adding parameters that interpret seasonal and long-term changes in atmospheric circulation and airmass mixing, which reduces uncertainties in detecting the stratospheric ozone recovery. 
 This study presents an updated evaluation of stratospheric ozone profile trends at Arosa/Davos/Hohenpeißenberg, Switzerland/Germany; Observatory de Haute-Provence (OHP), France; Boulder, Colorado, Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO) and Hilo, Hawaii; and Lauder, Aotearoa / New Zealand, with a focus on the ozone recovery period post-2000. Trends are derived using vertical ozone profiles from NOAA's Dobson network via the Umkehr method (with a recent new homogenization), ozonesondes, and the NOAA COHesive Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Instrument (SBUV)/Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) satellite-based record (COH) sampled to match the geographical coordinates of the ground-based stations used in this study. Analyses of long-term changes in stratospheric ozone time series were performed using the updated version (0.8.0) of the Long-term Ozone Trends and Uncertainties in the Stratosphere (LOTUS) independent linear trend (ILT) regression model. This study finds consistency between the trends derived from the different observational records, which is a key factor to the understanding of the recovery of the ozone layer after the implementation of the Montreal Protocol and its amendments that control ozone-depleting substance production and release into the atmosphere. The northern hemispheric Umkehr records of Arosa/Davos, OHP, and MLO all show positive trends in the mid- to upper stratosphere, with trends peaking at ∼ +2 % per decade. Although the upper-stratospheric ozone trends derived from COH satellite records are more positive than those detected by the Umkehr system, the agreement is within the 2 times the standard error uncertainty. Umkehr trends in the upper stratosphere at Boulder and Lauder are positive but not statistically significant, while COH trends are larger and statistically significant (within 2 times the standard error uncertainty). In the lower stratosphere, trends derived from Umkehr and ozonesonde records are mostly negative (except for positive ozonesonde trends at OHP); however, the uncertainties are quite large. Additional dynamical proxies were investigated in the LOTUS model at five ground-based sites. The use of additional proxies did not significantly change trends, but the equivalent latitude reduced the uncertainty in the Umkehr and COH trends in the upper stratosphere and at higher latitudes. In lower layers, additional predictors (tropopause pressure for all stations; two extra components of Quasi-Biennial Oscillation at MLO; Arctic Oscillation at Arosa/Davos, OHP, and MLO) improve the model fit and reduce trend uncertainties as seen by Umkehr and sonde."

Marais;Rebekah P. Horner;Dylan B. Millet;Kelly C. Wells;Alex B. Guenther,Natural emissions of VOC and NOx over Africa constrained by TROPOMI HCHO and NO2 data using the MAGRITTEv1.1 model,"Vegetation releases biogenic volatile organic compounds, while soils and lightning contribute to the natural emissions of nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere. These gases interact in complex ways. Using satellite data and models, we developed a new method to simultaneously optimize these natural emissions over Africa in 2019. Our approach resulted in an increase in natural emissions, supported by independent data indicating that current estimates are underestimated. 
 Natural emissions (vegetation, soil, and lightning) are the dominant sources of non-methane biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx≡ NO + NO2) released into the atmosphere over Africa. BVOCs and NOx interact with each other and strongly impact their own chemical lifetimes and degradation pathways, in particular through their influence on hydroxyl radical levels. To account for this intricate interplay between NOx and VOCs, we design and apply a novel inversion setup aiming at simultaneous optimization of monthly VOC and NOx emissions in 2019 in a regional chemistry-transport model, based on Tropospheric Ozone Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) HCHO and NO2 satellite observations. The TROPOMI-based inversions suggest substantial underestimations of natural NOx and VOC emissions used as a priori in the model. The annual flux over Africa increases from 125 to 165 Tg yr−1 for isoprene, from 1.9 to 2.4 TgN yr−1 for soil NO emissions, and from 0.5 to 2.0 TgN yr−1 for lightning NO emissions. Despite the NOx emission increase, evaluation against in situ NO2 measurements at seven rural sites in western Africa displays significant model underestimations after optimization. The large increases in lightning emissions are supported by comparisons with TROPOMI cloud-sliced upper-tropospheric NO2 volume mixing ratios, which remain underestimated by the model even after optimization. Our study strongly supports the application of a bias correction to the TROPOMI HCHO data and the use of a two-species constraint (vs. single-species inversion), based on comparisons with isoprene columns retrieved from the Cross-track Infrared Sensor (CrIS)."

 The Community Inversion Framework (CIF) brings together methods for estimating greenhouse gas fluxes from atmospheric observations. While the analytical and variational optimization methods implemented in CIF are operational and have proved to be accurate and efficient, the initial ensemble method was found to be incomplete and could hardly be compared to other ensemble methods employed in the inversion community, mainly owing to strong performance limitations and absence of localization methods. In this paper, we present and evaluate a new implementation of the ensemble mode, building upon the initial developments. As a first step, we chose to implement the serial and batch versions of the ensemble square root filter (EnSRF) algorithm because it is widely employed in the inversion community. We provide a comprehensive description of the technical implementation in CIF and the useful features it can provide to users. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities of the CIF-EnSRF system using a large number of synthetic experiments over Europe with the flexible and scalable high-performance atmospheric transport model ICON-ART, exploring the system’s sensitivity to multiple parameters that can be tuned by users. As expected, the results are sensitive to the ensemble size and localization parameters. Other tested parameters, such as the number of lags, the propagation factors, or the localization function, can also have a substantial influence on the results. We also introduce and provide a way of interpreting a set of metrics that are automatically computed by CIF and that can help assess the success of inversions and compare them. This work complements previous efforts focused on other inversion methods within CIF. While ICON-ART has been used for testing in this work, the integration of these new ensemble algorithms enables any atmospheric transport model to perform inversions, fully leveraging CIF's robust capabilities."

Given the ongoing global change and intensified anthropogenic NH3 emissions, it is projected that the global surface NH3 concentration will escalate further. Here, based on ground observations, gridded data of organic and inorganic nitrogen fertilizer applications, meteorological data, and ancillary information, we estimated changes in global monthly surface NH3 concentration during 2001–2019 at a 0.1°× 0.1° resolution. A novel scale-adaptive approach, essentially an Ensemble Random Forest Model built upon Rotated Quadtree Partitioning and Box-Cox Transformation, was developed. The model well reproduced the spatial and temporal patterns of surface NH3 observations, particularly capturing peak and valley values (R2 = 0.91 and slope = 0.82 for the whole; R2 = 0.79 and slope = 0.70 for testing). The results indicate a global increase in surface NH3 concentration over 2001–2019, from 1.44 μg m–3 yr–1 in 2001 to 1.51 μg m–3 yr–1 in 2019. Notably, hotspots of elevated NH3 concentrations were located in northern South Asia, northern China, the Sahel area, southeast South America, and central United States. Decreased SO2 emissions and increased fertilizer applications dominated the increase of surface NH3 concentrations in China, while in South Asia, the increase was primarily driven by organic and inorganic nitrogen inputs. Temperature changes were identified to play an important role in affecting surface NH3 concentrations in most regions, particularly in Africa, South America, and Oceania. These findings have the potential to facilitate research on global nitrogen cycle and its environmental footprints and inform the development of locally or regionally tailored nitrogen management strategies. Furthermore, the proposed modeling algorithm showcases its capability in capturing intricate patterns and relationships within highly spatially heterogeneous data, thereby addressing up-scaling challenges associated with multimodal site observations."

To fill this gap daily remotely sensed retrievals of radiative forcing and contribution to melt were analyzed over the MODIS period of record (2001–2023) to quantify spatiotemporal impacts of snow darkening. Each season radiative forcing magnitudes were lowest in early spring and intensified as snowmelt progressed, with interannual variability in timing and magnitude of peak impact. Over the full record, radiative forcing was elevated in the first decade relative to the last decade. Snowmelt was accelerated in all years and impacts were most intense in the central to southern headwaters.

Here, by combining various observations, statistical crop models, and Earth system model projections, we reveal that the omitting ozone effects leads to a significant inflation of the damaging impacts of warming on global agricultural yields. For example, comparing with previous model, our model shows that the mid‐century global warming impacts can decline by 1.99% (95% CI: 1.79%–3.24%) and 2.53% (95% CI: 2.03%–5.27%) for maize and soybean, respectively.

 Exposure to anthropogenic atmospheric aerosol is a major health issue, causing several million deaths per year worldwide. The oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons from traffic and wood combustion is an important anthropogenic source of low-volatility species in secondary organic aerosol, especially in heavily polluted environments. It is not yet established whether the formation of anthropogenic secondary organic aerosol involves mainly rapid autoxidation, slower sequential oxidation steps or a combination of the two. Here we reproduced a typical urban haze in the ‘Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets’ chamber at the European Organization for Nuclear Research and observed the dynamics of aromatic oxidation products during secondary organic aerosol growth on a molecular level to determine mechanisms underlying their production and removal. We demonstrate that sequential oxidation is required for substantial secondary organic aerosol formation. Second-generation oxidation decreases the products’ saturation vapour pressure by several orders of magnitude and increases the aromatic secondary organic aerosol yields from a few percent to a few tens of percent at typical atmospheric concentrations. Through regional modelling, we show that more than 70% of the exposure to anthropogenic organic aerosol in Europe arises from second-generation oxidation.

Greenhouse gases are complicating the problem, leading to longer orbital retention of defunct satellites and increasing the risk of collision. 
 Anthropogenic contributions of greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere have been observed to cause cooling and contraction in the thermosphere, which is projected to continue for many decades. This contraction results in a secular reduction in atmospheric mass density where most satellites operate in low Earth orbit. Decreasing density reduces drag on debris objects and extends their lifetime in orbit, posing a persistent collision hazard to other satellites and risking the cascading generation of more debris. This work uses projected CO2 emissions from the shared socio-economic pathways to investigate the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the satellite carrying capacity of low Earth orbit. The instantaneous Kessler capacity is introduced to compute the maximum number and optimal distribution of characteristic satellites that keep debris populations in stable equilibrium. Modelled CO2 emissions scenarios from years 2000–2100 indicate a potential 50–66% reduction in satellite carrying capacity between the altitudes of 200 and 1,000 km. Considering the recent, rapid expansion in the number of satellites in low Earth orbit, understanding environmental variability and its impact on sustainable operations is necessary to prevent over-exploitation of the region.

CO concentrations have decreased at −38.2 ± 31.4 ppbv yr−1 (−3.7% ± 1.8% yr−1) over China during 2013–2022. The declining trends in CO concentrations vary with space, stronger over larger, more polluted, and more industralized cities. GEOS-Chem simulations suggest that the decrease in CO anthropgenic emissions in China would be the main driver for the decreasing trends of CO over China, with a contribution of 80% to the trend. Meteorology, CO anthropgenic emissions over foreign regions, and emissions from biomass burning are the remaining drivers. Our results suggest remarkable benefits of emission reductions in China in abating CO pollution and enhance our understanding on trends of long-term CO pollution over China during 2013–2022."

Incomplete understanding of increases in Earth’s energy imbalance and ocean warming reduces the capability to accurately prepare for near term climate change and associated impacts. Here, satellite-based observations of Earth’s energy budget and ocean surface temperature are combined with the ERA5 atmospheric reanalysis over 1985–2024 to improve physical understanding of changes in Earth’s net energy imbalance and resulting ocean surface warming. A doubling of Earth’s energy imbalance from 0.6±0.2 Wm−2 in 2001–2014 to 1.2±0.2 Wm−2 in 2015–2023 is primarily explained by increases in absorbed sunlight related to cloud-radiative effects over the oceans. Observed increases in absorbed sunlight are not fully captured by ERA5 and determined by widespread decreases in reflected sunlight by cloud over the global ocean. Strongly contributing to reduced reflection of sunlight are the Californian and Namibian stratocumulus cloud regimes, but also recent Antarctic sea ice decline in the Weddell Sea and Ross Sea. An observed increase in near-global ocean annual warming by 0.1 for each 1 Wm−2 increase in Earth’s energy imbalance is identified over an interannual time-scale (2000–2023). This is understood in terms of a simple ocean mixed layer energy budget only when assuming no concurrent response in heat flux below the mixed layer. Based on this simple energy balance approach and observational evidence, the large observed near-global ocean surface warming of 0.27  from 2022 to 2023 is found to be physically consistent with the large energy imbalance of 1.85±0.2 Wm−2 from August 2022 to July 2023 but only if (1) a reduced depth of the mixed layer is experiencing the heating or (2) there is a reversal in the direction of heat flux beneath the mixed layer associated with the transition from La Niña to El Niño conditions. This new interpretation of the drivers of Earth’s energy budget changes and their links to ocean warming can improve confidence in near term warming and climate projections."

Here, we examined spatio-temporal trends in aerosol-induced atmospheric warming and the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) and surface cooling over the Indian Subcontinent under clear-sky and all-sky conditions using clouds and the earth’s radiant energy system data for the period 2000–2021. Overall, the regional mean TOA and surface cooling were found to increase by 0.06 W m−2 yr−1 and 0.09 W m−2 yr−1, respectively. Over the last two decades, the aerosol-induced atmospheric warming in all-sky conditions increased over the subcontinent landmass and outflow regions over the ocean while it declined over dust-dominated arid regions. This dipole pattern was driven by a combination of an overall increase in aerosol optical depth, a gradual increase in the fraction of scattering aerosols over the Indian landmass dominated by anthropogenic sources, a decline in dust loading over the arid sources. As a result, atmospheric warming efficiency declined in most parts of the Indian subcontinent. A comparative meta-analysis revealed that aerosol-induced atmospheric warming was over-estimated by the existing studies where aerosol direct radiative forcings were estimated by 1-D radiative transfer model utilizing modeled optical properties based on incomplete information about in-situ physico-chemical properties derived from ground-based measurements. Our analysis showed that TOA and surface cooling by aerosols were higher in clear-sky conditions relative to the actual all-sky condition by up to 11 W m−2 and 16 W m−2, respectively; therefore, atmospheric warming reported for clear-sky conditions would be biased high over the subcontinent. As India embarked on a clean air mission, changes in aerosol loading and its composition are expected to alter the dipole pattern further in the future, impacting the regional climate via dynamic feedback."

Maasakkers;Hannah Nesser;Zhen Qu;Yuzhong Zhang;John Worden,What can we learn about tropospheric OH from satellite observations of methane?,"The hydroxyl radical (OH) destroys many air pollutants, including methane. Global-mean OH cannot be directly measured, and thus it is inferred with the methyl chloroform (MCF) proxy. MCF is decreasing, and a replacement is needed. We use satellite observations of methane in two spectral ranges as a proxy for OH. We find shortwave infrared observations can characterize yearly OH and its seasonality but not the latitudinal distribution. Thermal infrared observations add little information. 
 The hydroxyl radical (OH) is the main oxidant in the troposphere and controls the lifetime of many atmospheric pollutants, including methane. Global annual-mean tropospheric OH concentrations ([OH‾]) have been inferred since the late 1970s using the methyl chloroform (MCF) proxy. However, concentrations of MCF are now approaching the detection limit, and a replacement proxy is urgently needed. Previous inversions of GOSAT (Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite) satellite measurements of methane in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) have shown success in quantifying [OH‾] independently of methane emissions, and observing system simulations have suggested that satellite measurements in the thermal infrared (TIR) may provide additional constraints on OH. Here we combine SWIR and TIR satellite observations from the GOSAT and AIRS instruments, respectively, in a 3-year (2013–2015) analytical Bayesian inversion optimizing both methane emissions and OH concentrations. We examine how much information can be obtained about the interannual, seasonal, and latitudinal features of the OH distribution. We use information from MCF data and the ACCMIP ensemble of global atmospheric chemistry models to construct a full prior error covariance matrix for OH concentrations for use in the inversion. This is essential to avoid an overfitting of the observations. Our results show that GOSAT alone is sufficient to quantify [OH‾] and its interannual variability independently of methane emissions and that AIRS adds little information. The ability to constrain the latitudinal variability of OH is limited by strong error correlations. There is no information on OH at midlatitudes, but there is some information on the NH/SH interhemispheric ratio, showing this ratio to be lower than currently simulated in models. There is also some information on the seasonal variation in OH concentrations, although it mainly confirms the variation simulated by the models."

To better understand the mechanisms by which aerosol influences thunderstorms, we look at the two busiest shipping lanes in the world, where recent regulations have reduced sulfur emissions by nearly an order of magnitude. We find that the reduction in emissions has been accompanied by a dramatic decrease in both lightning and the number of droplets in clouds over the shipping lanes. 
 Aerosol interactions with clouds represent a significant uncertainty in our understanding of the Earth system. Deep convective clouds may respond to aerosol perturbations in several ways that have proven difficult to elucidate with observations. Here, we leverage the two busiest maritime shipping lanes in the world, which emit aerosol particles and their precursors into an otherwise relatively clean tropical marine boundary layer, to make headway on the influence of aerosol on deep convective clouds. The recent 7-fold change in allowable fuel sulfur by the International Maritime Organization allows us to test the sensitivity of the lightning to changes in ship plume aerosol number-size distributions. We find that, across a range of atmospheric thermodynamic conditions, the previously documented enhancement of lightning over the shipping lanes has fallen by over 40 %. The enhancement is therefore at least partially aerosol-mediated, a conclusion that is supported by observations of droplet number at cloud base, which show a similar decline over the shipping lane. These results have fundamental implications for our understanding of aerosol–cloud interactions, suggesting that deep convective clouds are impacted by the aerosol number distribution in the remote marine environment."

 Quantitative measurements of atmospheric total OH reactivity (kOH′) provide crucial insights into atmospheric photochemistry. However, widespread application of total OH reactivity measurements is challenging due to insufficient equipment and the complexity of existing instrumentation. In this work, we report the development of a portable laser-flash photolysis Faraday rotation spectroscopy (LP-FRS) instrument for real-time and in situ measurement of kOH′. To achieve efficient overlapping between the pump and probe laser and realize a long effective absorption path length, thus enabling high-sensitivity measurement, a specific Herriott-type pump–probe optical multi-pass cell was designed. The instrument's optical box dimensions were 130 cm × 40 cm × 35 cm. The obtained effective absorption path was ∼ 28.5 m in a base length of 77.2 cm. The kOH′ detection precisions of the LP-FRS instrument were 2.3 and 1.0 s−1 with averaging times of 60 and 300 s, respectively. The kOH′ measurement uncertainty was evaluated to be within 2 s−1. Field measurement was performed, and the difference between the measured kOH′ and the model simulated from the measured reactive species was analysed. The developed portable LP-FRS instrument extends the measurement methods of atmospheric total OH reactivity and has certain advantages in terms of cost, operation, and transportation, which will play an increasingly important role in future atmospheric chemistry research."

We present the measurements of the photolytic mass change of SOA derived from photooxidation of three furan precursors, 3-methylfuran, 2-methylfuran, and furfural, in an environmental chamber under both dry and humid conditions. Each type of SOA was collected on crystal sensors, and the mass losses by photolysis under 300  or 340 nm light were continuously monitored using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). By incorporation of measurements and modeling, 10–40% of furan SOA masses can be lost by direct photolysis under solar radiation over their typical atmospheric lifetime. The mass loss fraction is well correlated with the mass fraction of nitrogen-containing compounds (NOC) in the SOA, possibly because these species can largely enhance the light absorption cross section and readily undergo photodissociation under UV light."

It is unknown how these changes affected the lung function of children. We analyzed data collected in 1995–1996 and 2017–2018. In each period, >2000 children 6–13 years were measured for lung function and surveyed for behavioral, residential, and health conditions. Monitored and modeled data for ambient air pollution were obtained. Age- and covariate-adjusted FVC and FEV1 values were lower, and the proportions of children with low FVC and FEV1 were greater in the later period than in the earlier period, while PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NOx, and O3 levels changed by −42.8 μg/m3 (95% CI, −67.3, −18.6 mg/m3), −65.1 μg/m3 (−113.5, −16.7 mg/m3), −34.6 ppb (−69.2, 0.0 ppb), −27.5 ppb (−60.7, 5.7 ppb), and 1.5 ppb (−4.2, 7.1 ppb), respectively. A 4 ppb O3 increase was associated with lower FVC by 105 mL (95% CI: 30, 180 mL) in boys and 76 mL (17, 135 mL) in girls. A generational decline in the lung function of children in the 4 Chinese cities has significant public health ramifications. Our findings imply that the reduction of ambient air pollutant concentrations from the 1995–1996 levels to the 2017–2018 levels were not sufficient to make lung function improvements. Risk factors that were absent or not as prominent in the earlier period may be responsible for lowered lung function during the later period."

We found that the 2023 coast‐to‐coast wildfires raged a staggering area of 13.02 Mha, more than seven times the historical average (2001–2022). The extreme wildfires were predominantly driven by record‐breaking drought, characterized by heightened atmospheric aridity and reduced precipitation, with specific water deficit thresholds triggering sharp increases in BA. Over 80% of the 2023 wildfires occurred in Canada's permafrost regions, with burned areas increasing more than six‐fold across extensive permafrost, including Arctic regions. These wildfires are expected to accelerate permafrost degradation and considerable carbon release from thawing, presenting previously overlooked risks.

 The growth and development of marine plants are largely dependent on nutrient input and solar radiation. Aerosols, through atmospheric deposition, can directly or indirectly influence the growth and distribution of marine organisms, while changes in cloud cover and aerosol presence can alter solar radiation levels. Gaining insight into aerosol-cloud interactions in the Northwest Pacific and their effects on marine plants can support the sustainable development and utilization of ocean resources. This study utilized aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from MODIS to examine the spatiotemporal distribution and potential sources of aerosols over the Northwest Pacific. Additionally, the study integrated MODIS data on cloud optical thickness of ice and liquid (COTI/COTL), cloud water path of ice and liquid (CWPI/CWPL), effective particle radii of ice and liquid clouds (CERI/CERL) and ocean net primary productivity (NPP) data from Oregon State University to analyze aerosol-cloud interaction patterns and their effects on marine phytoplankton. The results show that in the fishing grounds of the northwest Pacific (38°-46°N, 150°-175°E), the sustained northward migration and intensification of the subtropical high during summer weaken the upper-level atmosphere from Asia. This results in aerosols in the local marine area predominantly originating from the clean marine (CM) aerosols of the Pacific region, which typically peak from June to August each year (0.9). Aerosols in both the fishing and spawning grounds (20°-30°N, 130°-170°E) significantly affect the CWPI and CWPL, with those in the fishing grounds exerting a stronger influence. Furthermore, as the net primary productivity (NPP) in the fishing grounds is primarily influenced by clouds, aerosols indirectly impact local phytoplankton photosynthesis by suppressing cloud formation. In contrast, in the spawning grounds, the proximity to the East Asian continent leads to greater influence from human activities, with aerosol deposition and river inputs playing a dominant role in the local marine environment."

 The radiative perturbation of the Earth's energy balance caused by all aerosols, the direct radiative effect (DRE), and anthropogenic aerosols, the direct radiative forcing (DRF), remain major sources of uncertainty in climate projections. Here we propose a method for determining DRE and DRF that makes use of the High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL)-retrieved aerosol loading and derived aerosol types (i.e. dust, marine, urban, smoke, etc.) in combination with aerosol-type specific optical properties. As the global spatiotemporal distributions of HSRL-derived aerosol types are not currently available, the methodology is tested here using a global 3-D model of atmospheric chemistry (GEOS-Chem) along with Creating Aerosols from CHemistry (CATCH) algorithm-generated aerosol types analogous to ones derived by HSRL. In this method, the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for General Circulation Models (RRTMG) is used to perform radiative transfer calculations with the single scattering albedo (SSA) and asymmetry parameter (g) of atmospheric particles assigned based on the aerosol type in each grid box. Average GEOS-Chem/CATCH-derived all-sky DRE and DRF across the North American domain are estimated to be −1.98 W/m2 and − 0.77 W/m2, respectively between mid-January and early February 2013 and − 4.20 W/m2 and − 1.41 W/m2 respectively between mid-July and early August 2014. Sensitivity studies revealed that the scheme may produce up to about ±0.42 W/m2 and ± 0.21 W/m2 uncertainty in DRE and DRF, respectively, related to variability in aerosol type-specific optical properties. This study presents a new way of determining DRE and DRF estimates once global retrievals of aerosol intensive parameters by HSRL become available."

We find that different seasons strongly modulate the climate response, with Arctic surface warming observed in winter and cooling in summer. Additionally, as eruptions increase in terms of sulfur dioxide emissions, the climate response becomes increasingly insensitive to variations in emission strength. 
 Effusive, long-lasting volcanic eruptions impact climate through the emission of gases and the subsequent production of aerosols. Previous studies, both modelling and observational, have made efforts to quantify these impacts and untangle them from natural variability. However, due to the scarcity of large and well-observed effusive volcanic eruptions, our understanding remains patchy. Here, we use an Earth system model to systematically investigate the climate response to high-latitude, effusive volcanic eruptions, similar to the 2014–2015 Holuhraun eruption in Iceland, as a function of eruption season and size. The results show that the climate response is regional and strongly modulated by different seasons, exhibiting midlatitude cooling during summer and Arctic warming during winter. Furthermore, as eruptions increase in size in terms of sulfur dioxide emissions, the climate response becomes increasingly insensitive to variations in emission strength, levelling off for eruptions between 20 and 30 times the size of the 2014–2015 Holuhraun eruption. Volcanic eruptions are generally considered to lead to surface cooling, but our results indicate that this is an oversimplification, especially in the Arctic, where warming is found to be the dominant response during autumn and winter."

Monoterpene-derived OSs were significantly higher in southern cities than in northern cities, which was attributed to the temperature-dependent emission of monoterpenes (i.e., higher temperatures in southern cities drove more monoterpene emissions). However, isoprene-derived OSs (OSi) showed the opposite trend, with significantly higher levels in northern cities. Principal component analysis combined with field simulation combustion experiments suggested that biomass burning rather than gasoline, diesel, and coal combustion contributed significantly to the abundance of OSi in northern cities. The comparison of anthropogenic OS molecular characteristics between particles released from various combustion sources and ambient aerosol particles suggested that stronger biomass and fossil fuel combustion activities in northern cities promoted the formation of considerable anthropogenic OSs. Overall, this study provides direct molecular evidence for the first time that non-biogenic sources can significantly contribute to the formation of OSi in China during winter."

The paper deals with technical aspects of this process and shows how the reconstruction of the spectrum can be optimized. 
 Correct determination of the phase spectrum is a highly relevant task in Fourier transform spectrometry for concluding which spectral distribution most likely gave rise to the measured interferogram. We present implementation of an improved scheme for phase determination in the operational Collaborative Carbon Column Observing Network (COCCON) processor. We introduce a robust unwrapping scheme for retrieving a spectrally smooth phase spectrum at intermediate spectral resolution, which uses all spectral positions carrying enough signal to allow a significant determination of the phase. In the second step, we perform a least-squares fit of model parameters of a suitable analytical phase spectrum model through all reliable phase values constructed in the first step. The model fit exploits the fact that we expect the phase to be spectrally smooth. Still, it can be refined to reflect specific characteristics inherent to the optical and electronic layout of the interferometer. The proposed approach avoids the problems of the classical phase reconstruction method, which enforces a spectrally smooth phase by directly limiting spectral resolution when calculating the complex phase. Thereby, the phase is created from a very low number of interferogram points around the centerburst of the interferogram, which results in a suboptimal noise propagation from the interferogram into the spectral domain. Moreover, the interpolation of the phase spectrum across spectral subsections with reduced spectral signal is not well behaved, and results depend strongly on the numerical apodization function used for creating the low-resolution phase."

One of these interactions happens due to a small subset of aerosols, ice-nucleating particles (INPs). These INPs lead to the freezing of pure water droplets above −35 °C, which otherwise would stay liquid. This has impacts on the weather and climate. The present data set presents a unique data set with a high temporal resolution. 
 The Portable Ice Nucleation Experiment (PINE) was deployed during the Pallas Cloud Experiment (PaCE) 2022 for a three-month-period at the Sammaltunturi station in autumn 2022. The station is located on top of a hill on the edge between sub-Arctic and boreal forest environments, typically receiving air masses from the Arctic and the south. Since clouds are frequently present at the station during autumn, the present aerosol particles can have a direct impact on cloud properties. Ice-nucleating particles (INPs) are aerosol particles that facilitate primary ice nucleation in supercooled cloud droplets. The PINE measured the INP concentration with a high temporal resolution of six minutes at different nucleation temperatures between 240 K and 252 K. The INP concentration varied exponentially with the freezing temperature and differences between different months were observed. The highest median INP concentration was measured during December over the whole temperature range, while during November the lowest median INP concentration was measured. The data presented here is useful to study aerosol-cloud interactions for a sub-Arctic location with minimal anthropogenic influence. The high temporal resolution allows to correlate the INP concentration with other measurements, such as size distribution data and meteorological data. In addition, the data provides the ice nucleating ability of arriving aerosol particles, which can be combined with models to study the nature, the source and the age of the INPs."

This is partly due to the detailed model used to represent atmospheric transport. We demonstrate how a machine learning (ML) model can be used to simulate high-resolution atmospheric transport. This type of ML model will help estimate GHG emissions using dense observations, which are becoming increasingly common with the proliferation of urban monitoring networks and geostationary satellites. 
 There has been a proliferation of dense observing systems to monitor greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations over the past decade. Estimating emissions with these observations is often done using an atmospheric transport model to characterize the source–receptor relationship, which is commonly termed the measurement “footprint”. Computing and storing footprints using full-physics models is becoming expensive due to the requirement to simulate atmospheric transport at high resolution. We present the development of FootNet, a deep-learning emulator of footprints at the kilometer scale. We train and evaluate the emulator using footprints simulated with a Lagrangian particle dispersion model (LPDM). FootNet predicts the magnitudes and extents of footprints in near real time with high fidelity. We identify the relative importance of input variables of FootNet for improving the interpretability of the model. Surface winds and a precomputed Gaussian plume from the receptor are identified as the most important variables for footprint emulation. The FootNet emulator developed here may help address the computational bottleneck of flux inversions using dense observations."

An evaluation during the summer of 2023 shows that the updated model overall improves the simulation of MDA8 O3 by reducing the bias by 8%–12% in the contiguous US. PM2.5 predictions have mixed results due to wildfire, highlighting the need for future refinements. 
 The air quality forecasting system is an essential tool widely used by environmental managers to mitigate adverse health effects of air pollutants. This work presents the latest development of the next-generation regional air quality model (AQM) forecast system within the Unified Forecast System (UFS) framework in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The UFS air quality model incorporates the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model as its main chemistry component. In this system, CMAQ is integrated as a column model to solve gas and aerosol chemistry, while the transport of chemical species is processed by UFS. The current AQM version 7 (AQMv7) is coupled with an earlier version of CMAQ (version 5.2.1). Here we describe the development of the updated AQMv7 by coupling to a “state-of-the-science” CMAQ version 5.4. The updates include improvements in gas and aerosol chemistry, dry deposition processes, and structural changes to the input/output (I/O) interface, enhancing both computational efficiency and representation of air–surface exchange processes. A simulation was conducted for the period of June–August 2023 to assess the effects of these updates on the forecast performance of ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), two major air pollutants over the continental United States (CONUS). The results show that the updated model demonstrates an enhanced capability in simulating O3 over the CONUS by reducing the positive bias, leading to a reduction in the mean bias by 3 %–5 % and 8 %–12 % for hourly and the maximum daily 8 h average O3, respectively. Spatially, the updated model lowers the positive bias of hourly O3 in most of the 10 EPA regions, particularly within the central and northwest areas, while amplifying the O3 underestimation over the sites with negative bias. Similarly, the updates induce uniformly lower fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations across the CONUS domain, reducing the positive bias at some sites over the northeast in August and central Great Plains. The updated model does not improve model performance for PM2.5 in the vicinity and downwind of fire emission sources, where AQMv7 shows the highest negative bias, thus indicating a focal point of model uncertainty and needed improvement. Despite these challenges, the study highlights the importance of the ongoing refinements for reliable air quality predictions from the UFS-AQM model, which is a planned future update to NOAA's current operational air quality forecast system."

Our results reveal changes in particle characteristics during wildfire days, with particle number concentrations decreasing by 60% and particle diameter increasing by 30% compared to nonwildfire days. Moreover, the median lung deposited surface area (LDSA) levels rose by 31% during wildfire events. We employed gradient boosting models to estimate near-road LDSA levels on both wildfire and nonwildfire days. The LDSA ratio (wildfire/nonwildfire) exceeded 2.0 in certain areas along highways and in downtown Toronto. Furthermore, our findings show that marginalized communities faced greater LDSA increases than less marginalized ones. Under wildfire conditions, the LDSA ratio difference between the most and least marginalized groups was 16% for recent immigrants and visible minorities and 7% for seniors and children, both statistically significant.

The study revealed that dust could be coated by abundant fluorescent substances, with a maximum fluorescence efficiency reaching 0.15. Moreover, the fluorescent spectra of air pollutants exhibited a unimodal structure, while the spectra of dust exhibited three peaks, suggesting that they may be useful for highly accurate identification of dust aerosols from other aerosols. The findings in this study were confirmed by near-ground air sampling analysis based on fluorescence excitation–emission matrix-parallel factor (EEM-PARAFAC) methods; we demonstrated that HULIS and protein-like organic matter (PLOM) were the main components of fluorescent aerosols during the study period. During air pollution events, the number concentration of HULIS reached up to 9699 particles·m–3.

 The spatially continuous dynamic monitoring of near-surface NO2 concentrations on sub-daily scales would serve to enhance awareness of the current state of air pollution, which is crucial to improving regional air quality. Satellites, like OMI and TROPOMI, are capable of observing atmospheric NO2 column concentrations on a global scale. However, the fixed transit times of the satellites and severe data deficiencies restricted their applicability for revealing patterns of change in NO2 on sub-daily scales. This study proposes a time-constrained XGBoost model (T-XGB) to convert multi-source information to daily cumulative near-surface NO2 concentrations. Furthermore, a temporally conservative downscaling framework is developed to facilitate seamless monitoring of near-surface NO2 at the 0.03°/3-hour scale in China. Evaluated with in-situ NO2 measurements, the results have demonstrated the robust and excellent performance of the T-XGB (R2: 0.920–0.948; MAE: 2.89–3.67 µg/m3/h), as well as the accuracy of the temporally conserved downscaling technique (R2 > 0.973). The 3-hour near-surface NO2 was consistent with the TROPOMI observations at the corresponding moments and it exhibited a detailed gradient variation signature. In China, near-surface NO2 exhibited a single-peak diurnal variation, with an initial increase followed by a subsequent decrease. The maximum concentration was observed between 8p.m. and 11p.m. in local time. The assessment of NO2 pollution exposure can yield disparate results when evaluated at varying time scales. Sub-daily monitoring of NO2 provides a more detailed and nuanced understanding of the pollutant, making it a more applicable and flexible tool for use in subsequent studies."

Sensitivity tests revealed that the incorporation of complex processes enabled a balance in both radical concentrations and coordinate ratios, effectively addressing the deficiency in the ozone generation mechanism. The full-chain radical detection bridged the gap between the photochemistry and the intensive oxidation level. 
 The Yangze River Delta (YRD) in China encountered prolonged ozone pollution in September 2020. To accurately elucidate the limitations of oxidation processes in the chemically complex atmosphere, a full suite of radical measurements (OH, HO2, RO2, and kOH) was established in the YRD region for the first time. The diurnal peaks of radicals exhibited considerable variation due to environmental factors, showing ranges of 3.6 to 27.1 × 106 cm−3 for OH, 2.1 to 33.2 × 108 cm−3 for HO2, and 4.9 to 30.5 × 108 cm−3 for RO2. The simulated results provided by RACM2-LIM1 failed to adequately match the observed data in both radical concentration and experimental budget for a heavy ozone pollution episode. Sensitivity tests utilizing a comprehensive set of radical measurements revealed that the Higher Aldehyde Mechanism (HAM) effectively complements the regeneration of OH radicals, yielding enhancements of 4.4 %–6.0 % compared to the base scenario, while the concentrations of HO2 and RO2 radicals have shown increments of about 7.4 % and 12.5 %, respectively. It is noteworthy that under the constraints of kOH measurement, the inclusion of oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) and larger alkoxy radicals derived from monoterpenes improved the model–measurement consistency for ozone formation, reducing the discrepancy under high NO conditions from 4.17 to 2.39. This outcome corroborates the hypothesis of sensitivity analysis as it pertains to ozone formation. Moving forward, by implementing a comprehensive radical detection approach, further investigations should concentrate on a broader range of OVOCs to rectify the imbalance associated with RO2 radicals, thereby providing a more precise understanding of oxidation processes during severe ozone pollution episodes."

 This paper introduces a machine-learning-driven approach for automated nocturnal low-level jet (NLLJ) identification using observations of wind profiles from a radar wind profiler (RWP). The work discussed here is an effort to lay the groundwork for a systematic study of the mid-Atlantic NLLJ's formation mechanisms and their influence on nocturnal and diurnal air quality in major urban regions by establishing a general framework of NLLJ features and characteristics with an identification algorithm. Leveraging a comprehensive wind profile dataset maintained by the Maryland Department of the Environment's RWP network, our methodology employs supervised-machine-learning techniques to isolate the features of the southwesterly NLLJ because of its association with pollution transport in the mid-Atlantic states. This methodology was developed to illuminate spatiotemporal patterns and physical characteristics of NLLJ events to study their role in planetary boundary layer evolution and composition. This paper discusses the construction of this methodology, its performance against known NLLJs in the current literature, intended usage, and a preliminary statistical analysis. The results from this analysis have yielded a total of 90 southwesterly NLLJs from May–September of 2017–2021, as captured by the RWP stationed in Beltsville, MD (39.05° N, 76.87° W; 135 m a.s.l.). A composite analysis of 90 jets reveals that the mid-Atlantic NLLJ is characterized by a core wind speed exceeding 10 m s−1 at altitudes typically between 300–500 m above ground level, with maximum wind speeds occurring between 3–6 h after sunset. The jets show consistent wind direction from the southwest but transition from more southerly- to more westerly-dominated with increasing altitude and time after sunset. We hope our study equips researchers and policymakers with further means to monitor, predict, and address these nocturnal dynamics phenomena that frequently influence boundary layer composition and air quality in the US mid-Atlantic and northeastern regions."

At least 92% of disproportionately exposed inhabitants in rural regions reside in low SES areas, whereas a relatively smaller proportion (69–78%) reside in urban regions. The local source has a more profound impact on PM2.5 exposure during summer than winter. The inhabitants in polluted areas and low PM2.5 adjusted concentration areas accounted for 22% and 26% of total PM2.5 exposure during the winter. However, inhabitants residing in low-concentration areas contributed only 12% of total exposure during summer while those polluted areas contributed 30%. These findings provide valuable insights into the relationship between community-level PM2.5 exposure and SES, highlighting the need for more sophisticated air quality policies to alleviate socioeconomic inequalities in PM2.5 exposure."

Biomonitoring strategies have been developed to assess PM contamination. Among them, epiphyte plants are widely utilized due to their reliance on atmospheric inputs for nutrition. However, robust assessment of the effectiveness of such strategies remains limited. This study aimed to assess whether Tillandsia usneoides can accurately characterize PM contamination across four sites in a former French mining district over one year. Comparisons were made between (i) PM10 samplers capturing PM with an aerodynamic diameter < 10 μm and (ii) T. usneoides, which is assumed to accumulate all deposited particles (both wet and dry). The finding reveals that atmospheric composition measured by PM10 samplers and T. usneoides is consistent for 14 of the 27 elements analyzed. However, elements related to (micro)nutrients or those chemically similar to nutrients (Na, Rb, Sr), showed no significant or positive correlation. While epiphyte plants offer a cost-effective and efficient tool for (bio)monitoring PM composition, results involving elements playing a role in plant metabolism should be interpreted with caution. Further research should better highlight the mechanisms governing the complex interplays between PM properties, epiphyte microstructure, metabolic responses, and abiotic factors."

However, emerging evidence suggests that even relatively low-level air pollution can elevate the risk of autoimmune diseases. Recent biobank studies demonstrated a linear relationship between chronic exposure to relatively low-level ambient air pollution and the incidence of autoimmune diseases, particularly in genetically susceptible populations. Furthermore, evidence indicates that short-term exposure to low levels of PM2.5 is associated with disease flares. This Viewpoint highlights the often-overlooked risks of low-level air pollution in contributing to autoimmune diseases in individuals with genetic predispositions; it aims to raise awareness of prevention strategies and advocate nonpharmacological interventions at both the population and individual levels, to protect high-risk groups and alleviate the burden of autoimmune diseases."

This study analyzes the sources, transport routes, and dust concentrations during 13 North Pacific events in 2010 observed at Mt. Lulin on the Northwest Pacific margin. In addition to aerosol measurements, surface weather data, space lidar observations, MERRA‐2 reanalysis data, and trajectory simulations were used. The results show that, during transport to the Pacific, dust from North Africa and the Middle East first moves northeast to Central Asia (30–55°N) and ascends to 200–400 hPa before crossing East Asia. In contrast, dust from the Taklamakan Desert in East Asia rises to 300–400 hPa before being transported eastward. As these dust sources descend into East Asia, they often mix with dust from the Gobi Desert. Indian dust travels zonally eastward at altitudes of 600–800 hPa over Southeast Asia without mixing. In the northwest Pacific, reanalysis data show that while dust is concentrated near the surface, maximum outflow to the Pacific occurs at 400 hPa in the mid‐latitudes due to strong westerlies. Trajectory analysis combined with observations suggests that this high‐altitude transport includes dust from the Sahara, Arabia, and Taklamakan deserts. At Mt. Lulin along the subtropical coast of East Asia, measured dust concentrations during dust events range from 15 to 39 μg m−3, while the annual average is close to 5 μg m−3, accounting for 42% of the aerosol concentration over the high mountain."

Eriksson,Long-range transport influence on wintertime submicron aerosol chemical composition from simultaneous measurements in Lithuania and Southern Sweden,"•Two data sets of the same nature collected at two remote background sites. •Sea transport and precipitation have a mitigating effect on the PM1concentration. •The quantitative effect of long-range transport on PM1chemical composition evaluated. •Examination of the same air mass before and after crossing over the sea. •BBOAs and eBC were less efficiently removed by precipitation than OOA and inorganics. 
 Due to the large extent of seawater surface over the globe, aerosol particles spend significant time being transported over this type of surface. Therefore, global aerosol circulation is largely impacted by the processes particles undergo during long-range transport overseas. In this study, we investigated submicron aerosol (PM1) chemical composition changes during long-range transport events over the southern Baltic Sea across two sites in Sweden (Hyltemossa) and Lithuania (Preila). The chemical composition was determined simultaneously using mass spectroscopy (time-of-flight aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ToF-ACSM)) in Hyltemossa and quadrupole ACSM (Q-ACSM) in Preila and filter-based optical (AE33 in Hyltemossa and AE31in Preila) methods. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of long-range air mass transport over the sea on PM1 chemical composition at the two remote background sites in the southern Baltic Sea region. The campaign average PM1 concentration in Preila (11.2 μg/m3) was higher than in Hyltemossa (6.3 μg/m3). Yet, during long-range transport events, PM1 concentration in Preila, downwind, was 40% lower (2.5 μg/m3) than in Hyltemossa (4.3 μg/m3), upwind, suggesting aerosol removal and dilution processes over the sea. We used the meteorological and spatial parameters from backward trajectory analysis to categorise the long-range air mass transport events across the two sites. Then the combinations of dilution, wet and dry deposition, emissions over land and other processes were labelled as the sea transport effect, wet deposition processes and land-atmosphere interaction. The results showed that during the events when air mass trajectories stretched from west to east from over Hyltemossa to Preila without precipitation along the path, the PM1 concentration decreased on average by 50%. The addition of precipitation resulted in a larger decrease (70%) of PM1 concentration. However, during the events with precipitation when air mass trajectories passed over a continental area before arriving at the downwind site, the net decrease was the lowest (27%). The lowest relative change in PM1 concentration during those events suggests the potential uptake of pollutants into the air mass over land with more significant anthropogenic pollution sources. Our approach allows us to quantitively assess the mitigating effects of sea transport, wet deposition processes and the opposite effect when air mass is advected over land on PM1 concentration using the proposed classification based on meteorological and spatial parameters of HYSPLIT backward trajectories."

 The city of Urumqi experiences severe air pollution, for which the variations and causes remain unclear. Here, we comprehensively investigate the seasonality, trends, and drivers of fine and coarse particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM2.5-10) and ozone (O3) in Urumqi in the Chinese national context by statistical analysis of surface and satellite observations during 2015–2023. Wintertime PM2.5 in Urumqi is twice as high as that averaged over Eastern China due to intensive emissions and unfavourable topography and meteorology, monthly PM2.5-10 in Urumqi of above 40 μg m−3 year-round is driven by spring and autumn natural dust episodes and ubiquitous anthropogenic fugitive dust. During 2015–2023, PM2.5 and PM2.5-10 decreased by 34–38% credited to emissions control. However, the maximum daily 8h average (MDA8) O3 in Urumqi increases rapidly at a rate of 2.5 ppbv yr−1 due to increased volatile organic compounds (VOCs), decreased nitrogen oxides (NOx) in earlier years of 2015–2016, and decreased PM2.5. Impacts from VOCs and NOx emission changes are supported by summertime O3 formation regime transits from VOCs-limited to NOx and VOCs co-limited during 2015–2023 as depicted by surface O3-nitrogen dioxide (NO2) correlations and satellite formaldehyde (HCHO)/NO2 ratios. Responses of PM2.5, PM2.5-10, O3, and related gases during the 2020 winter and summer epidemic lockdowns conform to our findings for their 2015–2023 trends. This study concludes that joint NOx and VOCs emissions control would be particularly effective in reducing PM2.5 and O3 in Urumqi.

 Black carbon (BC) is a highly absorbent aerosol that significantly impacts regional air quality, public health, and global climate change. In this study, we develop a machine learning-based stacking model to estimate hourly BC in China, using observational data from 36 BC sites of the China Atmosphere Watch Network (CAWNET) from 2020 to 2023. The stacking model shows strong robustness and high accuracy nationwide, achieving a Pearson correlation coefficient (R) of 0.79 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.60 μg/m3. Compared to Tracking Air Pollution in China (TAP), the stacking model reduces bias by 33.8% in urban areas and 56.9% in rural areas. According to this model, the urban BC concentration is 48.5% higher than that in rural areas across China. North China Plain, Central China, and the Sichuan Basin continue to be the regions with the highest BC concentrations in China, with average concentrations of 1.73 ± 0.66 μg/m3, 1.61 ± 0.55 μg/m3, and 1.71 ± 0.58 μg/m3, respectively, from 2020 to 2023. During the COVID-19, urban areas experienced a consistent decline in BC concentrations from 2020 to 2022, followed by a rebound in 2023 (rural areas rebound in early 2022). Our research highlights that these high-quality hourly estimated BC concentrations can reveal pollution distribution patterns in both urban and rural areas, as well as during specific time periods, thereby providing crucial support for developing more accurate and effective emission reduction strategies, improving air quality, mitigating climate change, and protecting public health."

 During March 13–18, 2021, East Asia experienced the strongest dust storm in the last decade. This windblown dust event caused large-scale dispersion of aerosol pollution, and attracted widespread attention due to its severe impacts on land-atmosphere-marine ecosystems. Here we investigated the dust sources, transport, and deposition of this dust storm and its effects on the Asia-Pacific region by using ground observations, satellite remote sensing products, and numerical simulation. The results showed that the potential aeolian dust source was mainly located in the Gobi Desert in southern Mongolia and central Inner Mongolia. This dust storm generated rapid increases in ambient particle concentrations over northern and eastern China, the Korean peninsula, and southwestern Japan. Air quality in 82% of the studied East Asian cities deteriorated noticeably as a result of mineral dust intensification. The ground-based Mie-scattering lidar detected the long-distance dispersion of dust aerosols in the 3–5 km high altitudes over Seoul, Osaka, Tokyo, and Niigata. Approximately 16.1 Tg of floating dust was deposited in the Northwest Pacific Ocean. The intensity of dust deposition in the East China Sea was almost twice that in the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan. Satellite data revealed that dust particles transported remotely from the East Asian desert were deposited in the North Pacific, resulting in an evident increase (55%–86%) in regional chlorophyll-a concentrations within a week after this dust storm event. Marine algal blooms developed quickly in response to the joint effects of atmospheric dry or wet deposition and surface-ocean currents. This study quantitatively assessed the potential influences of this strong East Asian dust storm on the atmospheric and marine environment, providing a multi-angle perspective for investigating the dynamic long-range transport of aerosols and its implications for global dust cycles."

 Since the successful launch and operation of the FengYun-3E (FY-3E) satellite, the assessment of its data quality and applications has garnered significant attention. By comparison with previous studies focusing on the assessment on a single case, this research assimilates the Microwave Humidity Sounder-2 (MWHS-2) and the Microwave Temperature Sounder-3 (MWTS-3) data to evaluate the track and intensity prediction of 19 tropical cyclones (TCs) over the western North Pacific (WNP). This comprehensive investigation seeks to unravel the contributions of microwave radiance onboard FY-3E to the initial fields in the multi-typhoon predictions. For each TC case, three experiments are carried out to evaluate the effect of microwave radiance data on clear-sky assimilation: the control experiment (CONV) assimilates only conventional data, while the other two experiments incorporate MWHS-2 (MWHS) and MWTS-3 (MWTS) data, respectively. The results indicate that MWHS and MWTS exert distinct effects on dynamical and thermodynamic variables across various atmospheric levels. The positive impact of MWHS and MWTS on the track and intensity forecast has been proven, respectively, with the root mean square errors reduced by 3.86 % for track, 4.76 % for maximum wind speed (MWS), and 7.78 % for minimum surface level pressure (MSLP) relative to CONV. For the three-day average forecast errors, the MWHS exhibits the lowest daily mean track error, while the MWTS primarily contributes to reducing the MSLP error on the second day and the MWS error on the first and third days."

 Aerosols are key players in Earth's climate system, with mineral dust being a major component of the atmospheric aerosol load. While former campaigns focused on investigating the properties and effects of layers of rather pure mineral dust, the A-LIFE (Absorbing aerosol layers in a changing climate: aging, lifetime and dynamics) campaign in April 2017 aimed to characterize dust in complex aerosol mixtures. In this study we present ground-based lidar measurements that were performed at Limassol, Cyprus, in April 2017. During our measurement period, the measurement site was affected by complex mixtures of dust from different sources and pollution aerosols from local as well as long-range transported sources. Considering the lidar measurements from two ground-based systems, POLIS (portable lidar system) and PollyXT (portable lidar system with extended capabilities). We found mean values and mean systematic errors (standard deviation, SD, given in brackets) of the particle linear depolarization ratio and extinction-to-backscatter ratio (lidar ratio) of 0.26 ± 0.03 (SD of 0.02) and 41 ± 5 sr (SD of 3 sr) at 355 nm and of 0.29 ± 0.02 (SD of 0.02) and 38 ± 5 sr (SD of 6 sr) at 532 nm for Arabian dust and of 0.26 ± 0.03 (SD of 0.03) and 55 ± 8 sr (SD of 6 sr) at 355 nm and of 0.28 ± 0.02 (SD of 0.01) and 54 ± 8 sr (SD of 8 sr) at 532 nm for Saharan dust.

We use our measurements for aerosol typing and compare them to aerosol typing from sun photometer data, in situ measurements, and trajectory analysis.

The study is focused on an intense Saharan dust outbreak crossing the Iberian Peninsula in springtime monitored by five Iberian lidar stations with southwest–northeast coverage. A comparative study to evaluate the differences found by considering the total dust (no separation) is also examined. 
 Mineral dust has a key role in the Earth's radiative balance, and it has become significant over the Iberian Peninsula (IP), where Saharan dust outbreaks have seemed to increase in frequency and intensity. This study quantifies the dust direct radiative effect (DRE) in the short-wave range (SW) during an intense persistent springtime dust episode over the IP. In particular, the vertical distribution of dust optical properties was derived at five lidar stations, and the Global Atmospheric Model (GAME) was used for radiative transfer simulations. Moreover, this study innovates by simulating the SW DRE using two distinct methodologies. The novel approach separates the impacts of fine (Df) and coarse (Dc) dust components and calculates the total DRE as their combined sum. In contrast, the commonly used approach directly simulates the DRE for the total dust. Along the dust pathway crossing the IP, the SW DRE consistently registered a pattern of aerosol-induced cooling at both the surface, i.e the bottom of the atmosphere (BOA), and top of the atmosphere (TOA). Results reveal that the role of Df must be highlighted, as Df particles contributed nearly half of the total SW DRE at BOA and TOA, particularly for this event. DRE simulations based on the separation of dust modes for solar zenith angles < 70° show that nearly 75 % of DRE values are lower (in absolute value) with respect to those obtained by considering the total dust. That is, a less pronounced cooling effect is observed overall when the separation of dust modes is taken into account, although relative differences between approaches are not highly significant in general (−3 % and −6 % on average at BOA and TOA, respectively). However, this behaviour reverses under moderate-to-high-dust conditions when the contributions of the Dc and Df components are considered separately; i.e. dust induces a more pronounced cooling effect. This indicates the relevant role of the fine dust particles in DRE estimations, which is likely underestimated when total dust (no separation) is taken into account in relatively high-dust environments. In addition, the cooling effect is more evident at TOA than at BOA, probably due to the presence of dust at higher levels than those usual in the troposphere. This fact can introduce relevant implications for radiometric measurements from satellite instrumentation."

R. Digby;Knut von Salzen;Adam H. Monahan;Nathan P. Gillett;Jiangnan Li,The impact of uncertainty in black carbon's refractive index on simulated optical depth and radiative forcing,"The refractive index of black carbon (BCRI), which determines how much energy black carbon absorbs and scatters, is difficult to measure, and different climate models use different values. We show that varying the BCRI across commonly used values can increase absorbing aerosol optical depth by 42 % and the warming effect from interactions between black carbon and radiation by 47 %, an appreciable fraction of the overall spread between models reported in recent literature assessments. 
 The radiative forcing of black carbon (BC) is subject to many complex, interconnected sources of uncertainty. Here we isolate the role of the refractive index, which determines the extent to which BC absorbs and scatters radiation. We compare four refractive index schemes: three that are commonly used in Earth system models and a fourth more recent estimate with higher absorption. With other parameterizations held constant, changing BC's spectrally varying refractive index from the least- to  most-absorbing estimate commonly used in Earth system models (m550 nm=1.75–0.44i to m550 nm=1.95–0.79i) increases simulated absorbing aerosol optical depth (AAOD) by 42 % and the effective radiative forcing from BC–radiation interactions (BC ERFari) by 47 %. The more recent estimate, m532 nm=1.48–0.84i, increases AAOD and BC ERFari by 59 % and 100 % respectively relative to the low-absorption case. The AAOD increases are comparable to those from recent updates to aerosol emission inventories and, in BC source regions, up to two-thirds as large as the difference in AAOD retrieved from MISR (Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer) and POLDER-GRASP (Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances instrument with the Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties algorithm) satellites. The BC ERFari increases are comparable to previous assessments of overall uncertainties in BC ERFari, even though this source of uncertainty is typically overlooked. Although model sensitivity to the choice of BC refractive index is known to be modulated by other parameterization choices, our results highlight the importance of considering refractive index diversity in model intercomparison projects."

Prather;Paul J. DeMott,Wind-driven emission of marine ice-nucleating particles in the Scripps Ocean-Atmosphere Research Simulator (SOARS),"This article presents results from the first study in a new wind–wave channel at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The experiment tested how wind over the ocean surface influences production of sea spray particles, which are important for radiative forcing and cloud formation in the atmosphere. We found that particle concentration and chemical composition varied with wind speed and that variations were driven by changes in wind and wave breaking rather than seawater biology or chemistry. 
 Sea spray aerosol (SSA) represents one of the most abundant natural aerosol types, contributing significantly to global aerosol mass and aerosol optical depth, as well as to both the magnitude of and the uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing. In addition to its direct effects, SSA can also serve as ice-nucleating particles (INPs), which are required for the initiation of cloud glaciation at temperatures warmer than ca. −36 °C. This study presents initial results from the CHaracterizing Atmosphere-Ocean parameters in SOARS (CHAOS) mesocosm campaign, which was conducted in the new Scripps Ocean-Atmosphere Research Simulator (SOARS) wind–wave channel. SOARS allows for isolation of individual factors, such as wave height, wind speed, water temperature, or biological state, and can carefully vary them in a controlled manner. Here, we focus on the influence of wind speed on the emission of SSA and INPs. In agreement with recent Southern Ocean measurements, online INP concentrations during CHAOS showed an increasing relationship with wind speed, whereas offline CHAOS INP concentrations did not, which may be related to sampling inlet differences. Changes in the INP activated fraction, dominant INP particle morphology, and INP composition were seen to vary with wind. Seawater ice-nucleating entity concentrations during CHAOS were stable over time, indicating that changes in atmospheric INPs were driven by wind speed and wave-breaking mechanics rather than variations in seawater chemistry or biology. While specific emission mechanisms remain elusive, these observations may help explain some of the variability in INP concentration and composition that has been seen in ambient measurements."

We used models and deposition diagnostics to identify the processes controlling atmospheric sulfur and nitrogen deposition variability. Controlling factors included the uptake of gases and aerosols by hydrometeors, aerosol inorganic chemistry, particle dry deposition, ammonia bidirectional fluxes, gas deposition via plant cuticles and soil, and land use data. 
 Exceedances of critical loads for deposition of sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) in different ecosystems were estimated using European and North American ensembles of air quality models, under the Air Quality Model Evaluation International Initiative Phase 4 (AQMEII4), to identify where the risk of ecosystem harm is expected to occur based on model deposition estimates. The ensembles were driven by common emissions and lateral boundary condition inputs. Model output was regridded to common North American and European 0.125° resolution domains, which were then used to calculate critical load exceedances. Targeted deposition diagnostics implemented in AQMEII4 allowed for an unprecedented level of post-simulation analysis to be carried out and facilitated the identification of specific causes of model-to-model variability in critical load exceedance estimates.Datasets for North American critical loads for acidity for forest soil water and aquatic ecosystems were created for this analysis. These were combined with the ensemble deposition predictions to show a substantial decrease in the area and number of locations in exceedance between 2010 and 2016 (forest soils: 13.2 % to 6.1 %; aquatic ecosystems: 21.2 % to 11.4 %). All models agreed regarding the direction of the ensemble exceedance change between 2010 and 2016. The North American ensemble also predicted a decrease in both the severity and total area in exceedance between the years 2010 and 2016 for eutrophication-impacted ecosystems in the USA (sensitive epiphytic lichen: 81.5 % to 75.8 %). The exceedances for herbaceous-community richness also decreased between 2010 and 2016, from 13.9 % to 3.9 %. The uncertainty associated with the North American eutrophication results is high; there were sharp differences between the models in predictions of both total N deposition and the change in N deposition and hence in the predicted eutrophication exceedances between the 2 years. The European ensemble was used to predict relatively static exceedances of critical loads with respect to acidification (4.48 % to 4.32 % from 2009 to 2010), while eutrophication exceedance increased slightly (60.2 % to 62.2 %).While most models showed the same changes in critical load exceedances as the ensemble between the 2 years, the spatial extent and magnitude of exceedances varied significantly between the models. The reasons for this variation were examined in detail by first ranking the relative contribution of different sources of sulfur and nitrogen deposition in terms of deposited mass and model-to-model variability in that deposited mass, followed by their analysis using AQMEII4 diagnostics, along with evaluation of the most recent literature.All models in both the North American and European ensembles had net annual negative biases with respect to the observed wet deposition of sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium. Diagnostics and recent literature suggest that this bias may stem from insufficient cloud scavenging of aerosols and gases and may be improved through the incorporation of multiphase hydrometeor scavenging within the modelling frameworks. The inability of North American models to predict the timing of the seasonal peak in wet ammonium ion deposition (observed maximum was in April, while all models predicted a June maximum) may also relate to the need for multiphase hydrometeor scavenging (absence of snow scavenging in all models employed here). High variability in the relative importance of particulate sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium deposition fluxes between models was linked to the use of updated particle dry-deposition parameterizations in some models. However, recent literature and the further development of some of the models within the ensemble suggest these particulate biases may also be ameliorated via the incorporation of multiphase hydrometeor scavenging. Annual sulfur and nitrogen deposition prediction variability was linked to SO2 and HNO3 dry-deposition parameterizations, and diagnostic analysis showed that the cuticle and soil deposition pathways dominate the deposition mass flux of these species. Further work improving parameterizations for these deposition pathways should reduce variability in model acidifying-gas deposition estimates. The absence of base cation chemistry in some models was shown to be a major factor in positive biases in fine-mode particulate ammonium and particle nitrate concentrations. Models employing ammonia bidirectional fluxes had both the largest- and the smallest-magnitude biases, depending on the model and bidirectional flux algorithm employed. A careful analysis of bidirectional flux models suggests that those with poor NH3 performance may underestimate the extent of NH3 emission fluxes from forested areas.Model–measurement fusion in the form of a simple bias correction was applied to the 2016 critical loads. This generally reduced variability between models. However, the bias correction exercise illustrated the need for observations which close the sulfur and nitrogen budgets in carrying out model–measurement fusion. Chemical transformations between different forms of sulfur and nitrogen in the atmosphere sometimes result in compensating biases in the resulting total sulfur and nitrogen deposition flux fields. If model–measurement fusion is only applied to some but not all of the fields contributing to the total deposition of sulfur or nitrogen, the corrections may result in greater variability between models or less accurate results for an ensemble of models, for those cases where an unobserved or unused observed component contributes significantly to predicted total deposition.Based on these results, an increased process-research focus is therefore recommended for the following model processes and for observations which may assist in model evaluation and improvement: multiphase hydrometeor scavenging combined with updated particle dry-deposition, cuticle, and soil deposition pathway algorithms for acidifying gases, base cation chemistry and emissions, and NH3 bidirectional fluxes. Comparisons with satellite observations suggest that oceanic NH3 emission sources should be included in regional chemical transport models. The choice of a land use database employed within any given model was shown to significantly influence deposition totals in several instances, and employing a common land use database across chemical transport models and critical load calculations is recommended for future work."

Measurements revealed urban emission impact on surrounding areas. CRI full period averages at 520 nm were 1.41 – 0.037i (urban), 1.52 – 0.038i (peri-urban), and 1.50 – 0.025i (rural). Organic aerosols dominated the aerosol mass and contributed up to 22 % of absorption at 370 nm. 
 The complex refractive index (CRI; n−ik) and the single scattering albedo (SSA) are key parameters driving the aerosol direct radiative effect. Their spatial, temporal, and spectral variabilities in anthropogenic–biogenic mixed environments are poorly understood. In this study, we retrieve the spectral CRI and SSA (370–950 nm wavelength range) from in situ surface optical measurements and the number size distribution of submicron aerosols at three sites in the greater Paris area, representative of the urban city, as well as its peri-urban and forested rural environments. Measurements were taken as part of the ACROSS (Atmospheric Chemistry of the Suburban Forest) campaign in June–July 2022 under diversified conditions: (1) two heatwaves leading to high aerosol levels, (2) an intermediate period with low aerosol concentrations, and (3) an episode of long-range-transported fire emissions. The retrieved CRI and SSA exhibit an urban-to-rural gradient, whose intensity is modulated by the weather conditions. A full campaign average CRI of 1.41−0.037i (urban), 1.52−0.038i (peri-urban), and 1.50−0.025i (rural) is retrieved. The imaginary part of the CRI (k) increases and the SSA decreases at the peri-urban and forest sites when exposed to the influence of the Paris urban plume. Values of k > 0.1 and SSA < 0.6 at 520 nm are related to a black carbon mass fraction larger than 10 %. Organic aerosols are found to contribute to more than 50 % of the aerosol mass and up to 10 % (urban), 17 % (peri-urban), and 22 % (forest) of the aerosol absorption coefficient at 370 nm. A k value of 0.022 (370 nm) was measured at the urban site for the long-range-transported fire episode."

Besides local heat waves, we quantify the impact of atmospheric blocking on downstream ozone concentrations, which is closely associated with the blocking position. We identify three major pathways of Rossby wave propagation, stressing the critical role of large-scale circulation in regional air quality. 
 High surface ozone concentrations pose substantial health risks, yet understanding the factors influencing ozone levels, especially the role of large-scale circulations, remains incomplete. A key challenge is accurately modeling both large-scale circulations and ozone concentrations. Using a high-resolution Earth system model (25 km atmospheric resolution), we explore how local meteorology and large-scale circulations affect ozone levels. Our results show that heat waves can trigger substantial increases in ozone concentrations by stimulating biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions during the summers of 2015–2019. For example, maximum daily 8 h (MDA8) ozone concentrations during heat waves increase by 12.0 ppbv in the southeastern US, 9.7 ppbv in Europe, 17.6 ppbv in North China, and 9.0 ppbv in central eastern China compared to non-heat-wave periods. In addition to local effects, atmospheric blocking strongly influences downstream meteorological conditions and ozone formation. Focusing on ozone pollution in eastern China, we identify three major pathways of Rossby wave propagation based on blocking locations: the Euro-Atlantic sector, northern Russia, and the North Pacific. These pathways lead to increased air temperature and intensify downward surface solar radiation downstream. The impact of blocking is most pronounced in central eastern China, where MDA8 ozone concentrations increase by 5.9 to 10.7 ppbv during blocking compared to non-blocking periods, followed by North China (2.1 to 4.9 ppbv). Blocking also stimulates BVOC emissions, enhancing MDA8 ozone concentrations by 10.6 to 15.9 ppbv in these regions. These findings highlight the critical role of large-scale atmospheric circulation in shaping regional air quality, especially under a warming climate."

Mohammadloo;Matthew Jones;Bas van de Kerkhof;Kyle Dawson;Brendan J. Smith;Stephen Conley;Abigail Corbett;Rutger IJzermans,Quantitative estimate of several sources of uncertainty in drone-based methane emission measurements,"Methane is a potent greenhouse gas. Trustable detection and quantification of methane emissions at facility level are critical for identifying the largest sources and prioritizing them for repair. We provide a systematic analysis of several sources of uncertainty in drone-based methane emission surveys based on theoretical considerations and historical data sets. We provide guidelines for industry on how to avoid or minimize errors in drone-based methane emission quantification surveys. 
 Site-level measurements of methane emissions are used by operators for reconciliation with bottom-up emission inventories with the aim to improve accuracy, thoroughness,  and confidence in reported emissions. In that context it is of critical importance to avoid measurement errors and to understand the measurement uncertainty. Remotely piloted aircraft systems (commonly referred to as “drones”) can play a pivotal role in the quantification of site-level methane emissions. Typical implementations use the “mass balance method” to quantify emissions, with a high-precision methane sensor mounted on a quadcopter drone flying in a vertical curtain pattern; the total mass emission rate can then be computed post hoc from the measured methane concentration data and simultaneous wind data. Controlled-release tests have shown that errors with the mass balance method can be considerable. For example, Liu et al. (2024) report absolute errors for more than 100 % for the two drone solutions tested; on the other hand, errors can be much smaller, of the order of 16 % root-mean-square errors in Corbett and Smith (2022), if additional constraints are placed on the data, restricting the analysis to cases where the wind field was steady. In this paper we present a systematic error analysis of physical phenomena affecting the error in the mass balance method for parameters related to the acquisition of methane concentration data and to postprocessing. The sources of error are analyzed individually, and it must be realized that individual errors can accumulate in practice, and they can also be augmented by other sources that are not included in the present work. Examples of these sources include the uncertainty in methane concentration measurements by a sensor with finite precision or the method used to measure the unperturbed wind velocity at the position of the drone. We find that the most important source of error considered is the horizontal and vertical spacings in the data acquisition,  as a coarse spacing can result in missing a methane plume. The potential error  can be as high as 100 % in situations where the wind speed is steady and the methane plume has a coherent shape, contradicting the intuition of some operators in the industry. The likelihood of the extent of this error can be expressed in terms of a dimensionless number defined by the spatial resolution of the methane concentration measurements and the downwind distance from the main emission sources. What is learned from our theoretical error analysis is then applied to a number of historical measurements in a controlled-release setting. We show how what is learned  about the main sources of error can be used to eliminate potential errors during the postprocessing of flight data. Second, we evaluate an aggregated data set of 1001 historical drone flights; our analysis shows that the potential errors in the mass balance method can be of the order of 100 % on occasion, even though the individual errors can be much smaller in the vast majority of the flights. The Discussion section provides some guidelines for industry on how to avoid or minimize potential errors in drone measurements for methane emission quantification."

These living datasets are updated every year to provide the highest transparency and traceability in the reporting of CO2, the key driver of climate change. 
 Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere in a changing climate is critical to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe and synthesize datasets and methodologies to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFOS) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC) are based on land-use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly, and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The global net uptake of CO2 by the ocean (SOCEAN, called the ocean sink) is estimated with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based fCO2 products (fCO2 is the fugacity of CO2). The global net uptake of CO2 by the land (SLAND, called the land sink) is estimated with dynamic global vegetation models. Additional lines of evidence on land and ocean sinks are provided by atmospheric inversions, atmospheric oxygen measurements, and Earth system models. The sum of all sources and sinks results in the carbon budget imbalance (BIM), a measure of imperfect data and incomplete understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as ±1σ.For the year 2023, EFOS increased by 1.3 % relative to 2022, with fossil emissions at 10.1 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1 (10.3 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1 when the cement carbonation sink is not included), and ELUC was 1.0 ± 0.7 GtC yr−1, for a total anthropogenic CO2 emission (including the cement carbonation sink) of 11.1 ± 0.9 GtC yr−1 (40.6 ± 3.2 GtCO2 yr−1). Also, for 2023, GATM was 5.9 ± 0.2 GtC yr−1 (2.79 ± 0.1 ppm yr−1; ppm denotes parts per million), SOCEAN was 2.9 ± 0.4 GtC yr−1, and SLAND was 2.3 ± 1.0 GtC yr−1, with a near-zero BIM (−0.02 GtC yr−1). The global atmospheric CO2 concentration averaged over 2023 reached 419.31 ± 0.1 ppm. Preliminary data for 2024 suggest an increase in EFOS relative to 2023 of +0.8 % (−0.2 % to 1.7 %) globally and an atmospheric CO2 concentration increase by 2.87 ppm, reaching 422.45 ppm, 52 % above the pre-industrial level (around 278 ppm in 1750). Overall, the mean of and trend in the components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959–2023, with a near-zero overall budget imbalance, although discrepancies of up to around 1 GtC yr−1 persist for the representation of annual to semi-decadal variability in CO2 fluxes. Comparison of estimates from multiple approaches and observations shows the following: (1) a persistent large uncertainty in the estimate of land-use change emissions, (2) low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO2 flux in the northern extra-tropics, and (3) a discrepancy between the different methods on the mean ocean sink.This living-data update documents changes in methods and datasets applied to this most recent global carbon budget as well as evolving community understanding of the global carbon cycle.

However, there has been little investigation of this effect. We examine the global evolution of future carbonaceous aerosol under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways projected reforestation and deforestation scenarios using the CESM2 model from present‐day to 2100. Compared to present‐day, the change in future biogenic volatile organic compounds emission follows changes in forest coverage, while fire emissions decrease in both projections, driven by trends in deforestation fires. The associated carbonaceous aerosol burden change produces moderate aerosol direct radiative forcing (−0.021 to +0.034 W/m2) and modest mean reduction in PM2.5 exposure (−0.11 μg/m3 to −0.23 μg/m3) in both scenarios. We find that future anthropogenic LUC may be more important in determining atmospheric carbonaceous aerosol burden than direct anthropogenic emissions, highlighting the importance of further constraining the impact of LUC."

 The Arctic is experiencing heightened precipitation, affected by aerosols impacting rainfall and snowfall. However, sparse aerosol observations in the central Arctic cryosphere contribute to uncertainties in simulating aerosol-precipitation two-way interaction. This study examines aerosol-precipitation co-variation in various climate models during the Arctic spring and summer seasons from 2003 to 2011, leveraging satellite-based aerosol data and various CMIP6 climate models. Findings reveal significant spatio-temporal biases between models and observations. Snowfall dominance occurs in models where total AOD surpasses the observation by 121% (57–186%, confidence interval), intensifying simulated snowfall by two times compared to rainfall during summer. Consequently, climate models tend to underestimate central Arctic rainfall to the total precipitation ratio, suggesting a positive bias towards snowfall dominance. This highlights the importance of constraining total AOD and associated aerosol schemes in climate models using satellite measurements, which potentially could lead to a substantial reduction in snowfall contribution to the total precipitation ratio in the central Arctic, contrary to current multi-model simulations across various spatiotemporal scales."

 This study explores how the mixing structures and coating compositions of black carbon (BC) particles influence their light absorption, focusing on liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), which separates organic and inorganic phases and redistributes BC from the inorganic core (Icore) to the organic coating (Ocoating). Using transmission electron microscopy and 3D-modeling, we found that the BC core’s position significantly impacts its light absorption. A BC core embedded within the Icore shows stronger light absorption at wavelengths below 600 nm compared to the same core in the Ocoating. When Ocoating is considered as brown carbon (BrC), it reduces BC core’s light absorption at 350 nm due to shielding effect, but its overall impact on the entire BC particle is minimal (–3.0% ± 1.6%). The result indicates that in LLPS particles, the BrC coating primarily enhances light absorption, emphasizing the need to consider both mixing structures and coating compositions of BC in atmospheric models."

 Dicarboxylic acids are important constituents of organic aerosols, but the lack of their seasonal and vertical distribution hinders thorough knowledge of atmospheric physicochemical behavior. This study examines dicarboxylic acids at three heights (∼3, 118, and 488 m) on the 600 m high Canton Tower in urban Guangzhou, aiming to illustrate their primary sources and formation pathways across different seasons and heights. The concentration of dicarboxylic acids (678.7 ± 351.9 ng m−3) was lower or comparable to those in domestic cities but higher than in remote aeras. Oxalic acid had the highest concentration, with malonic, succinic, glyoxylic, and azelaic acids following. Most dicarboxylic acids peaked in autumn, following by winter, spring and summer. Higher dicarboxylic acids were observed at upper layers. The C3/C4 (1.5 ± 0.5) was relatively higher, and the proportion of C2 in dicarboxylic acids increased with height. Our results showed that combustion and secondary conversion were primary sources of dicarboxylic acids in dry season, while biomass combustion and secondary formation processes dominated during wet season. Significant gas-phase oxidations were prevalent during summer, while aqueous-phase formations were prominent in spring. Aerosol aging process played an important role at higher atmospheric levels throughout the year, suggesting an enhanced atmospheric oxidation capacity in upper boundary layers. These vertical profiling measurements enable the identification of predominant origins and formation pathways of dicarboxylic acids across different seasons and boundary layer dynamics. The findings provide critical insights for understanding atmospheric chemical evolution processes, validating atmospheric models, and developing effective air pollution mitigation strategies."

However, the impact of WUI fires on air quality and health is less understood compared to that of fires in wildland. We analyze WUI fire impacts on air quality and health at the global scale using a multi-scale atmospheric chemistry model—the Multi-Scale Infrastructure for Chemistry and Aerosols model (MUSICA). WUI fires have notable impacts on key air pollutants [e.g., carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and ozone (O3)]. The health impact of WUI fire emission is disproportionately large compared to wildland fires primarily because WUI fires are closer to human settlement. Globally, the fraction of WUI fire–caused annual premature deaths (APDs) to all fire–caused APDs is about three times of the fraction of WUI fire emissions to all fire emissions. The developed model framework can be applied to address critical needs in understanding and mitigating WUI fires and their impacts."

Here we present optical observations by ASIM and simultaneous radio measurements by lightning receivers in China, that confirm this proposition. The concurrent measurements suggest that corona discharges at cloud tops generate elves observable by ASIM when the peak current exceeds ∼140 kA in absolute value, as estimated from the NBE measurements. The appearance of elves offers an alternate method to estimate the corona discharge currents and alignments at cloud tops, relevant to the characterization of chemical perturbations to greenhouse gas agents at the tropical tropopause."

Larrea Valdivia,"Mountain‐Facilitated Lee‐Slope Transport and Daytime Boundary Layer Mixing of Volcano Plumes Exacerbates Air Pollution Over Arequipa, Peru","Severe air pollution plagues Arequipa, Peru, due to anthropogenic and natural emissions. Persistent volcano emission in the vicinity of Arequipa makes it among the largest SO2 sources in the world. Because volcano plumes mostly exist in the free troposphere and stratosphere where horizontal transport acts rather quickly, previous studies mostly focused on their global‐scale impacts. Whether these plumes can affect near‐surface air quality has not attracted much research attention. This study uses WRF‐Chem simulations to reveal that in the presence of northerly/northwesterly winds and favorable mountain meteorology, the plume from volcano Sabancaya (elevation 5,960 m, ∼80 km north of Arequipa) can be brought down to near the surface of Arequipa through two steps of transport and dispersion processes: (a) With northerly/northwesterly winds, the free troposphere plume from Sabancaya is transported southward and intercepted by Mountain Chachani located between Sabancaya and Arequipa and subsequently transported downward to Arequipa by nighttime downslope winds linked to large‐amplitude lee‐side mountain gravity waves. Often the plume reaches down to be close to the boundary layer over Arequipa. (b) In the following day, convective boundary layer growth brings the above boundary‐layer plume to near the surface through vertical mixing processes, thus exacerbating ambient air pollution in Arequipa. A mechanism on how volcano plumes above 6‐km height cause air pollution over the lower‐lying Arequipa city is therefore revealed for the first time. The mountain dynamic effect in inducing the large‐amplitude mountain lee waves is further illustrated by an idealized simulation excluding mountain's thermal effect."

 Satellite video, as an emerging data source for Earth observation, enables dynamic monitoring and has wide-ranging applications in diverse fields. Nevertheless, cloud occlusion hinders the ability of satellite video to provide uninterrupted monitoring of the Earth’s surface. To mitigate the interference of clouds, cloud-free areas need to be selected before application, or an optimized solution like a cloud removal algorithm can be utilized to recover the occluded regions, both of which inherently demand the precise detection of clouds. However, no existing methods are capable of robust cloud detection in satellite videos. We propose the first sub-second-level satellite video cloud detection model VCDFormer to handle this problem. In VCDFormer, a spatial–temporal-enhanced transformer consisting of a local spatial–temporal reconfiguration block and a spatial-enhanced block is introduced to explore global spatial–temporal correspondence efficiently. Additionally, we construct WHU-VCD, the first sub-second-level synthetic dataset specifically designed to capture the more realistic motion characteristics of both thick and thin clouds in satellite videos. Compared to the state-of-the-art cloud detection methods, VCDFormer achieves an approximate 10%–15% improvement in the IoU metric and a 5%–8% increase in the F1-Score on the simulated test set. Experimental evaluations on Jilin-1 satellite videos, involving both synthetic and real-world scenarios, demonstrate that our proposed VCDFormer achieves superior performance in satellite video cloud detection tasks.

The generation of chlorine by the iron chlorides Fe(III)Cln(3−n) ${\mathrm{C}\mathrm{l}}_{n}^{(3-n)}$ will also occur due to iron present in shipping plumes. To study efficiency and environmental implications, there is a need for additional information about the behavior of the process under a range of atmospheric conditions. Here, we use box modeling to evaluate whether it is possible to experimentally observe this mechanism in a ship's plume, or in a plume of pure iron dust, emitted for example, from a tower. Detection limits for Cl, Cl2 ${\text{Cl}}_{2}$, HOCl, ClO, ClNO3 ${\text{ClNO}}_{3}$, ClNO2 ${\text{ClNO}}_{2}$, CO, C2H6 ${\mathrm{C}}_{2}{\mathrm{H}}_{6}$, δ13CCO ${\mathit{\delta }}^{13}{\mathrm{C}}_{\mathrm{CO}}$, and CH2O ${\text{CH}}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ are determined based on values from the literature. We find that the most promising and low‐cost experimental indicators of chlorine atom production are the concentration of photoactive iron and the CO:ethane ratio, and Cl2 ${\text{Cl}}_{2}$ is a useful indicator if cost is not a limitation. For ships with high NOx ${\text{NO}}_{x}$ emissions, ClNO2 ${\text{ClNO}}_{2}$, and ClNO3 ${\text{ClNO}}_{3}$ could also potentially be used, and for towers emitting Fe without NOx ${\text{NO}}_{x}$ the concentration of HOCl and ClO could be used. δ13CCO ${\mathit{\delta }}^{13}{\mathrm{C}}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ is a very direct method to detect methane removal, but only gives a clear signal for high iron emissions."

Meteorological factors such as surface solar radiation, temperature, and wind influence the photovoltaic potential (PVPOT) and wind energy potential (WEP). Black carbon aerosols (BC), with their strong capacity to absorb shortwave radiation, induce regional climate changes, underscore the non‐negligible impact on PVPOT and WEP. This study utilizes the Community Earth System Model to project changes in PVPOT and WEP under shared socioeconomic pathways and their responses to BC. Results indicate that the model accurately delineated the spatial distribution and historical trends of five meteorological elements: wind speed, air temperature, surface solar radiation, surface pressure and surface specific humidity. In the SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios, both PVPOT and WEP exhibited remarkable regional and seasonal variations. In Western Europe, Canada, Tibetan Plateau, and most parts of eastern China, PVPOT is projected increase, while the induced BC enhances the increase in PVPOT on the Tibetan Plateau. Effects of BC on the annual trends of PVPOT vary across regions. Furthermore, the global average of both PVPOT and WEP is expected to increase, with BC strengthening the increase of PVPOT, but scenario differences exist in WEP. In the SSP245 scenario, BC will induce a global average PVPOT increase of 0.41 × 10−3 W/m2 by 2100."

The results showed that the concentration and size distribution of pre-fog aerosol had significant impacts on fog microphysical characteristics. The extinction of fog interstitial particles played an important role in visibility degradation for light fogs, especially in polluted regions. 
 Enhancing the understanding of fog microphysical processes is essential for reducing uncertainty in fog forecasts, particularly in predicting fog visibility and duration. To investigate the complex interactions between aerosols and fog microphysics and their impacts on visibility degradation, simultaneous measurements of aerosol and fog microphysical characteristics were conducted from April to May 2023 at a mountain site (1483 m a.s.l.) in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, China. In this study, eight fog events were investigated during the campaign, revealing significantly higher fog droplet number concentrations (Nd) compared to those observed in clean areas. A strong correlation was found between pre-fog aerosol number concentration (Na) and the peak Nd of each fog event, indicating the substantial influence of pre-existing aerosol levels on fog microphysics. Water vapor supersaturation ratio (SS) within fogs was estimated to 0.07 % ± 0.02 %, slightly higher than previous estimates in urban and suburban areas. The broadening of the droplet size distribution (DSD) at formation, development, and mature stages was dominantly driven by activation, condensation, and collision–coalescence mechanisms, respectively. This evolution process often led DSD to a shift from a unimodal to a trimodal distribution, with peaks around 6, 12, and 23 µm. For fog events occurring under high Na background, a notable decrease in temperature during the mature stage promoted a secondary activation-dominated process, resulting in the formation of numerous small fog droplets and a reduction in the large droplet size. The evolution of DSD can significantly influence visibility (VIS) in fogs. Detailed comparison of several visibility calculation methods suggests that estimating visibility based on the extinction of fog droplets only led to considerable overprediction when 100 m <VIS≤1000 m. The results highlight the necessity of incorporating both fog droplets and aerosol extinction in fog visibility forecasts, particularly in anthropogenically polluted regions."

CAPSS indicates no trend in volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, consistent with satellite observations of formaldehyde (HCHO) and glyoxal (CHOCHO), but surface aromatic concentrations show a 5.0 ± 3.9 % a−1 decrease. Peak season (May–June) maximum 8 h daily average (MDA8) surface ozone (O3) exceeds the 60 ppbv standard everywhere at AirKorea sites, with an increase of 0.8 ± 0.9 ppbv a−1 in the 90th percentile averaged across all sites indicating VOC-limited conditions for O3 production. However, satellite HCHO/NO2 ratios indicate a shift from VOC- to NOx-limited as NOx emissions decrease. Most AirKorea sites are in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA), where vestiges of VOC-limited conditions persist; we find no O3 increases over the rest of South Korea. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been decreasing at 5.0 ± 1.6 % a−1, but the nitrate (NO3-) component has not. Satellite NH3/NO2 ratios show that PM2.5 NO3- formation was NH3-sensitive before 2019 but is now becoming NOx-sensitive as NOx emissions decrease. Our results indicate that further NOx emission decreases will reap benefits for both O3 and PM2.5 NO3- as their production is now dominantly NOx-sensitive."

The GeoNEX dataset is the high temporal frequent dataset of the latest geostationary satellites observations. We also release the software, GeoNEXTools, that helps handling the GeCGO data. GeCGO data and GeoNEXTools could help scientists use geostationary satellite data at their interested ground observational sites. 
 The latest generation of geostationary satellites provide Earth observations similar to widely used polar orbiting sensors but at intervals as frequently as every 5–10 minutes, making them ideal for studying diurnal dynamics of land-atmosphere interactions. The NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) group created the GeoNEX datasets by collating data from several geostationary platforms, including GOES-16/17/18, Himawari-8/9, and GK-2A, and placing them on a common grid to facilitate use by the Earth science community. Here, we document the GeoNEX Coincident Ground Observations dataset (GeCGO) for terrestrial ecosystems studies, and provide examples for its use. Currently, GeCGO provides GOES-16 Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) data over a 10 x 10 km area surrounding 1586 network sites across Americas. GeCGO make it easy to compare the time series of geostationary data with the diurnal ground observations including carbon/water fluxes and aerosol optical depth, and is extensible to other regions. We also developed GeoNEXTools to facilitate analyses that require both GeoNEX data and other NASA satellite data. The objectives of this paper are to introduce GeCGO and GeoNEXTools, and demonstrate their applications. First, we describe the details of GeCGO and GeoNEXTools. Second, we explain how GeCGO can be integrated with other satellite data. Finally, we showcase comparisons between GeCGO and observations from three ground-based networks."

This work introduces two approaches to represent light scattering by small particles. The first is a scattering simulator based on Mie theory implemented in Python. The second is a neural network emulator that is more accurate than existing methods and is fast enough to be used in climate and weather simulations. 
 The direct interactions of atmospheric aerosols with radiation significantly impact the Earth's climate and weather and are important to represent accurately in simulations of the atmosphere. This work introduces two contributions to enable a more accurate representation of aerosol optics in atmosphere models: (1) NeuralMie, a neural network Mie scattering emulator that can directly compute the bulk optical properties of a diverse range of aerosol populations and is appropriate for use in atmosphere simulations where aerosol optical properties are parameterized, and (2) TAMie, a fast Python-based Mie scattering code based on the Toon and Ackerman (1981) Mie scattering algorithm that can represent both homogeneous and coated particles. TAMie achieves speed and accuracy comparable to established Fortran Mie codes and is used to produce training data for NeuralMie. NeuralMie is highly flexible and can be used for a wide range of particle types, wavelengths, and mixing assumptions. It can represent core-shell scattering and, by directly estimating bulk optical properties, is more efficient than existing Mie code and Mie code emulators while incurring negligible error compared to existing aerosol optics parameterization schemes (0.08 % mean absolute percentage error)."

This new chemistry accounts for the formation of sulfate via aqueous oxidation of SO2 in aerosol liquid water and the formation of hydroxymethanesulfonate (HMS) – often confused by measurement techniques as sulfate. Model performance in predicting sulfur PM2.5 in Fairbanks, Alaska, and other places that experience dark and cold winters is improved. 
 A portion of Alaska's Fairbanks North Star Borough was designated as nonattainment for the 2006 24 h fine particulate matter 2.5 µm or less in diameter (PM2.5) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) in 2009. PM2.5 NAAQS exceedances in Fairbanks mainly occur during dark and cold winters, when temperature inversions form and trap high emissions at the surface. Sulfate (SO42-), often the second-largest contributor to PM2.5 mass during these wintertime PM episodes, is underpredicted by atmospheric chemical transport models (CTMs). Most CTMs account for primary SO42- and secondary SO42- formed via gas-phase oxidation of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and in-cloud aqueous oxidation of dissolved S(IV). Dissolution and reaction of SO2 in aqueous aerosols are generally not included in CTMs but can be represented as heterogeneous reactive uptake and may help better represent the high SO42- concentrations observed during Fairbanks winters. In addition, hydroxymethanesulfonate (HMS), a particulate sulfur species sometimes misidentified as SO42-, is known to form during Fairbanks winters. Heterogeneous formation of SO42- and HMS in aerosol liquid water (ALW) was implemented in the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system. CMAQ simulations were performed for wintertime PM episodes in Fairbanks (2008) as well as over the Northern Hemisphere and Contiguous United States (CONUS) for 2015–2016. The added heterogeneous sulfur chemistry reduced model mean sulfate bias by ∼ 0.6 µg m−3 during a cold winter PM episode in Fairbanks, AK. Improvements in model performance are also seen in Beijing during wintertime haze events (reducing model mean sulfate bias by ∼ 2.9 µg S m−3). This additional sulfur chemistry also improves modeled summertime SO42- bias in the southeastern US, with implications for future modeling of biogenic organosulfates."

Compared to our previous study, new satellite-based CO2 inversions were included and an updated mask of managed lands was used, improving agreement for Brazil and Canada. The proposed methodology can be regularly applied as a check to assess the gap between top-down inversions and bottom-up inventories. 
 In this study, we provide an update on the methodology and data used by Deng et al. (2022) to compare the national greenhouse gas inventories (NGHGIs) and atmospheric inversion model ensembles contributed by international research teams coordinated by the Global Carbon Project. The comparison framework uses transparent processing of the net ecosystem exchange fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) from inversions to provide estimates of terrestrial carbon stock changes over managed land that can be used to evaluate NGHGIs. For methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), we separate anthropogenic emissions from natural sources based directly on the inversion results to make them compatible with NGHGIs. Our global harmonized NGHGI database was updated with inventory data until February 2023 by compiling data from periodical United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) inventories by Annex I countries and sporadic and less detailed emissions reports by non-Annex I countries given by national communications and biennial update reports. For the inversion data, we used an ensemble of 22 global inversions produced for the most recent assessments of the global budgets of CO2, CH4, and N2O coordinated by the Global Carbon Project with ancillary data. The CO2 inversion ensemble in this study goes through 2021, building on our previous report from 1990 to 2019, and includes three new satellite inversions compared to the previous study and an improved managed-land mask. As a result, although significant differences exist between the CO2 inversion estimates, both satellite and in situ inversions over managed lands indicate that Russia and Canada had a larger land carbon sink in recent years than reported in their NGHGIs, while the NGHGIs reported a significant upward trend of carbon sink in Russia but a downward trend in Canada. For CH4 and N2O, the results of the new inversion ensembles are extended to 2020. Rapid increases in anthropogenic CH4 emissions were observed in developing countries, with varying levels of agreement between NGHGIs and inversion results, while developed countries showed a slowly declining or stable trend in emissions. Much denser sampling of atmospheric CO2 and CH4 concentrations by different satellites, coordinated into a global constellation, is expected in the coming years. The methodology proposed here to compare inversion results with NGHGIs can be applied regularly for monitoring the effectiveness of mitigation policy and progress by countries to meet the objectives of their pledges.

Raff,Photosensitizers Regulate Nitrate Photoproduct Yields in Bulk Aqueous Matrices,"Photolysis of nitrate (NO3–) in the presence of photosensitizers is thought to promote the release of atmospherically important reactive nitrogen species (NOy), such as HONO, via mechanisms that are poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted photochemistry studies on mixtures of NO3–, a model photosensitizer [4-benzoylbenzoic acid (4-BBA)], and various aliphatic organic matter proxies. We found that aliphatic organic matter enhances the production of NOy and superoxide (O2–) from bulk aqueous nitrate photolysis, while the addition of 4-BBA decreases NOy and O2– yields in most cases. This effect was not observed in heterogeneous systems, where 4-BBA enhanced photochemical NOy production when coadsorbed with NO3– on silica surfaces. This demonstrates that photosensitizers act as both oxidants and reductants, regulating the yields of NOy and reactive oxygen species from nitrate photochemistry. Given sufficient residence time in the bulk aqueous phase, nitrate photoproducts can be scavenged via secondary reactions with photosensitizers. In heterogeneous and aerosol systems with high surface area-to-volume ratios, however, volatilization of NOy photoproducts is favored, and NOy production is less affected by chromophoric organic matter sinks in the bulk phase. This work demonstrates the intricate role of aliphatic and chromophoric moieties in natural organic matter in the photochemical conversion of NO3– to NOy (i.e., renoxification) in the atmosphere."

This study deployed high time resolution, high sensitivity instruments to sample on-road vehicle emissions in Los Angeles, CA (LA) and Las Vegas, NV (LV) in the summer of 2021. The total oxidant approach was used to estimate average NO2/NOx values from vehicle plumes, which were 6.3 ± 0.5 and 5.9 ± 0.4% for LA and LV, respectively. Ratios of aromatic VOCs to three different combustion tracers, NOx, CO, and CO2, were analyzed and found to be greater for toluene (C7) than benzene (C6), but decreased with carbon number for C7–C10 aromatics. NOx emission factors, calculated using the carbon balance method, were 3.41 ± 0.24 and 4.69 ± 0.32 g NOx per kg of fuel burned for LA and LV, respectively, consistent with values extracted from the Fuel-based Inventory of Vehicle Emissions (FIVE).

The impacts of stratospheric Quasi‐Biennial Oscillation (QBO) and tropospheric El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events on stratospheric circulation will affect the stratosphere‐to‐troposphere transport of ozone. In this study we use average of stratosphere‐tagged ozone tracer (O3S) from two chemistry‐climate models to quantify the downward transport of stratospheric ozone. We found that under the westerly QBO (WQBO) phase, less than the average stratospheric ozone is transported to the troposphere (2.5–6 ppbv O3S anomaly from 500 to 200 hPa in mid‐high latitudes). The opposite is true under the easterly QBO (EQBO) phase, accompanied by more stratospheric ozone transport to the troposphere (5–10 ppbv O3S anomaly from 500 to 200 hPa). The impact of ENSO events on the stratosphere‐to‐troposphere ozone transport shows a hemispheric asymmetry. The ozone transported into the troposphere decreases by about 2.5–6 ppbv from 500 to 200 hPa in the Northern Hemisphere under the warm ENSO phase, but shows almost the same amount of anomalous increase in the Southern Hemisphere. The situation is opposite during the cold ENSO phase. This variation in ozone transport in response to the QBO and ENSO is related to the stratospheric residual circulation variations. In a warming future climate, the frequency of El Niño events will increase while the amplitude of QBO is expected to decrease, thus affecting the stratospheric source of tropospheric ozone."

Both satellite observations in 2022 and subsequent chemistry‐climate model simulations forced by realistic Hunga perturbations reveal large‐scale cooling in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) tropical to subtropical stratosphere following the Hunga eruption. This study analyzes the drivers of this cooling, including the distinctive role of anomalies in water vapor, ozone, and sulfate aerosol concentration on the simulated climate response to the Hunga volcanic forcing, based on climate simulations with prescribed chemistry/aerosol. Simulated circulation and temperature anomalies based on specified‐chemistry simulations show good agreement with previous coupled‐chemistry simulations and indicate that each forcing of ozone, water vapor, and sulfate aerosol from the Hunga volcanic eruption contributed to the circulation and temperature anomalies in the SH stratosphere. Our results also suggest that (a) the large‐scale stratospheric cooling during the austral winter was mainly induced by changes in dynamical processes, not by radiative processes, and that (b) the radiative feedback from negative ozone anomalies contributed to the prolonged cold temperature anomalies in the lower stratosphere (∼70 hPa level) and hence to long lasting cold conditions of the polar vortex."

It is a scientific challenge to understand the causes for this increase and determine adaptation and mitigation actions to confront its climatic effects. During the last decades, spatial and temporal coverage of water vapor satellite observations increased notably, and reanalysis water vapor estimates have steadily improved. However, the scarce spatial and temporal coverage in the Arctic of integrated water vapor (IWV) surface‐based observations limits the representativeness of satellite observations and reanalysis estimate validations. Recently, we validated sun photometer IWV (IWVsp) observations with IWV from radiosondes in the Arctic. Here, we compare the hourly means of IWVsp from 13 Arctic AERONET stations and the IWV from ERA‐5 and MERRA‐2 reanalyses. The comparison is conducted at hourly timescale for individual stations for two Arctic regions and for the whole Arctic. The comparison showed a moist bias of IWV from reanalyses with respect to IWVsp. The individual station wise pattern shows slightly better accuracy and precision for ERA5 than for MERRA‐2 also evident at the selected subregional scale. The differences of IWV from ERA5 and MERRA‐2 and IWVsp show no dependence on IWVsp nor the solar zenith angle.

 The stratospheric CO budget is determined by CH4 oxidation, OH-driven loss and atmospheric transport. These processes can be constrained using CO mole fractions and isotopic compositions, with the latter being largely unexplored. We present novel stratospheric observations of δ13C-CO and δ18O-CO vertical profiles, revealing distinct altitude-dependent trends. δ13C-CO decreases with altitude due to inverse 13C kinetic fractionation in the OH sink and 13C-depleted CO from CH4 oxidation. In contrast, δ18O-CO increases with altitude, driven by 18O-rich oxygen from O(1D) via O3 photolysis and CO2 photolysis. Our findings suggest that CO isotopes can act as valuable proxies for quantifying CO production from CO2 photolysis. Incorporating CO mole fractions and isotopic data into global models enhances evaluations of the stratospheric CH4 sink and OH abundance, improving our understanding of stratospheric water vapour and its radiative impacts."

Adverse effects on regional air quality,"•Northern Greece forest fires during August 2023 degraded regional air quality. •NO2levels over Thesaloniki, Greece, reached 30 Pmolec/cm2beyond the typical August levels of 10 Pmolec/cm2. •Increased formaldehyde levels, 25-35 Pmolec/cm2, beyond the typical summertime levels of ∼12 Pmolec/cm2were observed. •CO levels exceeded the expected background loads by more than 100.00 ± 10.61 ppb. •The predicted frequency rise of major wildfires demands urgent changes in typical urban air quality monitoring practices. 
 The frequency, severity, and duration of wildfires are on the rise worldwide, underscoring the importance of comprehending the health impacts of wildfire exposure. The main aim of this work is to examine the effects that the Northern Greece forest fires during August 2023 had on regional air quality levels. On August 21st, a massive forest fire started within the Dadia Forest National Park, a protected area, nearby the city of Alexandroupoli. During the nearly ten-day duration of the fire, approximately 80,000 ha burned, while the strong prevailing easterly winds transported smoke particles and biomass burning gases over Northern Greece and the Mediterranean Sea, reaching the coasts of Italy and Tunisia. Using both spaceborne observations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), formaldehyde (HCHO) and carbon monoxide (CO), as well as ground-based instrumentation in the city of Thessaloniki, the extend of the degradation of air quality has been quantified. The spatially resolved Sentinel-5P TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (S5P/TROPOMI) observations showed how the fire plumes spread throughout Northern Greece, degrading massively the air quality near the fire event as well as over Thessaloniki, some 300 km to the west. NO2 levels were enhanced up to 82 % over the fire location whereas in the metropolis of Thessaloniki by 36 %, testifying to the extent of the fire, the dispersion of the plume and the emission strength. During the main fire days HCHO levels were shown to be enhanced by 54 % in the greater area of Alexandroupoli and by 114 % in the vicinity of Thessaloniki, in line with other works. The longer-lived CO was found similarly enhanced in both locations, ∼26 %, with a longer lasting effect to regional air quality. Ground-based remote sensing resulted in similar findings with MAX-DOAS spectrophotometer observations of nitrogen dioxide capturing the build-up of the transported NO2 load over Thessaloniki with morning levels reaching 30 Pmolec/cm2, testifying to the magnitude of the transported NO2 loads well beyond the stable variability of the typical August mean NO2 levels of 10 Pmolec/cm2. The MAX-DOAS also measured increased formaldehyde levels throughout the days of the fire event, between 25 and 35 Pmolec/cm2, unaffected by the photochemical processes destroying NO2, and well beyond the typical summertime levels of ∼12 Pmolec/cm2. FTIR spectroscopy observations, also routinely performed over Thessaloniki, revealed that the long-lived carbon monoxide levels exceeded the expected background loads by more than 100.00 ± 10.61 ppb on the second major fire day. The predicted frequency increase of such major wildfire events places an imperative need for changes in the typical urban air quality monitoring practices currently in place, to account for unexpected degradation of the breathable air, as well as changes on how mitigation measures are presently applied by regional and central government."

 Accurate NOx emission estimates are required to better understand air pollution, investigate the effectiveness of emission restrictions, and develop effective emission control strategies. This study investigates and demonstrates the ability and uncertainty of the superposition column model in combination with the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) tropospheric NO2 column data to estimate city-scale NOx emissions and chemical lifetimes and their variabilities. Using the recently improved TROPOMI tropospheric NO2 column product (v2.4–2.6), we derive daily NOx emissions and chemical lifetimes over the city of Wuhan for 372 d with full NO2 coverage between May 2018 and December 2023 and validate the results with bottom-up emission inventories. We find an insignificant weekly cycle of NOx emissions for Wuhan. We estimate a summer-to-winter emission ratio of 0.77, which may be overestimated to some extent but is still lower than suggested by the bottom-up inventories. We find a steady decline in NOx emissions from 2019 to 2023 (except for the sudden drop in 2020 caused by the COVID-19 lockdown), indicating the success of the emission control strategy. The superposition model method results in an ∼ 15 % lower estimation of NOx emissions when the wind direction is from distinct upwind NO2 hotspots compared to other wind directions, indicating the need to improve the approach for cities that are not relatively isolated pollution hotspots. The method tends to underestimate NOx emissions and lifetimes when the wind speed is > 5–7 m s−1, and, in Wuhan's case, the underestimation is ∼ 4 % for the emissions and ∼ 8 % for the chemical lifetime. The results of this work nevertheless confirm the strength of the superposition column model in estimating urban NOx emissions with reasonable accuracy."

Theeuwes;Janet F. Barlow;Antti Mannisenaho;Denise Hertwig;Ewan O'Connor;Alan Robins,Observations of tall-building wakes using a scanning Doppler lidar,"A Doppler lidar was placed in a highly built-up area in London to measure wakes from tall buildings during a period of 1 year. We were able to detect wakes and assess their dependence on wind speed, wind direction, and atmospheric stability. 
 High-rise buildings, increasingly a feature of many large cities, impact local atmospheric flow conditions. Tall-building wakes affect air quality downstream due to turbulent mixing and require parameterisation in dispersion models. Previous studies using numerical or physical modelling have been performed under idealised and neutral conditions. There has been a lack of data available in real urban environments due to the difficulty in deploying traditional wind sensors. Doppler wind lidars (DWLs) have been used frequently for studying wind turbine wakes but never building wakes. This study presents a year-long deployment of a DWL in a complex urban environment, studying tall-building wakes under atmospheric conditions. A HALO Photonics StreamLine DWL was deployed in a low- and mid-rise densely packed area in central London. From its rooftop position (33.5 m a.g.l. compared to mean building height of 12.5 m), velocity azimuth display (VAD) scans at 0° elevation intersected with two taller nearby buildings of 90 and 40 m a.g.l. Using an ensemble-averaging approach, wake dimensions were investigated in terms of wind direction, stability, and wind speed. Boundary layer stability categories were defined using eddy covariance observations from the BT Tower (191 m), and mixing height estimations were made from vertical stare scans. A method for calculating normalised velocity deficit from VAD scans is presented. For neutral conditions, wake dimensions around both buildings for the prevailing wind direction were compared with the ADMS-Build wake model for a single, isolated cube. The model underpredicts wake dimensions, confirming previous wind tunnel findings for the same area. Under varying stability, unstable and deep boundary layers were shown to produce shorter, narrower wakes. Typically observed wake lengths were 120–300 m, and widths were 80–150 m and reduced by 50–100 m downwind. Stable and shallow boundary layers were less frequent and produced an insignificant difference in wake dimensions compared to neutral conditions. The sensitivity to stability was weakened by enhanced turbulence upstream (i.e. due to other building wakes). Weakened stability dependence was confirmed if there were more obstacles upstream as the wind direction incident on the buildings changed. The results highlight the potential for future wake studies using multiple DWLs  deploying both vertical and horizontal scan patterns. Dispersion models should incorporate the effect of a complex urban canopy within which tall buildings are embedded."

To evaluate the practical application value of these data, we must assess their quality. We evaluate the quality of YUNYAO RO data. By using the “three-cornered hat” method and comparing with data from Metop-C and COSMIC-2, it was found that the YUNYAO GNSS-RO data are of high quality. 
 Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) data are an important component of numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems. To incorporate more GNSS-RO data into NWP systems, commercial RO data have become an excellent option. Tianjin Yunyao Aerospace Technology Co., Ltd. (YUNYAO) plans to launch a meteorological constellation of 90 satellites equipped with GNSS-RO instruments, which will significantly increase the amount of GNSS-RO data in NWP systems. This study evaluates the quality of neutral atmospheric refractivity and bending angle profiles from YUNYAO satellites Y003 to Y010 during the period from 1 May  to 31 July 2023. Compared with the refractivity and bending angle calculated from ERA5, the absolute values of the mean bias (MB) for YUNYAO refractivity and bending angle data are less than 1.54 % and 4.51 %, respectively, in the height range of 0 to 40 km and close to 0 between 4 and 40 km. The standard deviations (SDs) are below 3.35 % and 11.06 %, respectively, with variations in SDs among different GNSS satellites, especially in the lower troposphere and the stratosphere. Second, the refractivity error SD of YUNYAO RO data is estimated using the “three-cornered hat” (3CH) method and multiple data sets. In the pressure range of 1000–10 hPa, the refractivity error SD of YUNYAO RO data is below 2.53 %, and the differences in refractivity error SDs among different GNSS satellites do not exceed 0.52 %. Finally, compared to COSMIC-2 and Metop-C RO data, YUNYAO RO data exhibit consistent refractivity error SDs and are smaller within 300–50 hPa."

However, the role of the consumed VOCs caused by chlorine radicals is not clear. Here, observations combined with model simulations suggest that photochemical depletion of VOCs oxidized by chlorine radicals would not only promote the formation of ozone and oxygenated organic molecules (OOMs) but also help explain the nonlinear chemistry between secondary pollutants (O3 and OOMs) and precursors (VOCs and NOx). This enhancement of O3 and OOMs by chlorine radicals is nonlinearly dependent on the ratio of VOCs to NOx, and the connection of O3 and secondary organic aerosol with VOCs/NOx provides critical insight into the understanding of the oxidation processes of VOCs and intermediates from emission, reaction, and products."

Therefore, we conducted a study in the East China Sea─a region with high VOC emission potential─and a nearby coastal city in the Yangtze River Delta─a background receptor site. Seawater VOC emissions showed marked spatial variability, with alkenes forming an important component. Terrestrial inorganic nutrient inputs boosted marine primary productivity, elevating VOC concentrations and emissions. Interestingly, in the coastal city, severe photochemical pollution occurred when air masses originated predominantly from the sea. Although maritime air masses contained fewer VOCs, emissions from high-productivity seawater and shipping increased reactive alkene levels. Additionally, higher temperatures, stronger solar radiation, and reduced NO titration effects over the sea facilitated ozone formation. By integrating marine-terrestrial observations, this study underscores the impact of pollutant emissions from high-productivity seas on coastal air quality, particularly through secondary formation during long-range transport. The link between coastal seawater eutrophication and air photochemical pollution emphasizes the need for coordinated air and water pollution control in coastal cities. These findings may apply to other similar coastal environments worldwide."

This study evaluated MII methods at midstream facilities by deploying two TD aerial methods to inform a traditional BU inventory. The BU inventory used activity and emission factors, following an enhanced Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) methodology. The study highlighted challenges in implementing MII at midstream facilities, including significant disagreement in TD methods (up to 2:1), discrepancies between TD and operator estimated inventory (OEI), limited use of measurements to improve inventories due to confusion and distrust, and underestimated analysis costs, often matching the expense of TD surveys. Results from this study show both the potential of MII methods and the current challenges associated with implementing them."

Furthermore, we compare vendor-provided emission rate estimates to estimates from an open-source quantification algorithm applied to the raw CMS concentration data. This experimental setup allows us to separate the effect of the sensor platform (i.e., sensor type and arrangement) from the quantification algorithm. We find that 1) localization and quantification estimates rarely agree between the three CMS solutions on short time scales (i.e., 30 min), but temporally aggregated emission rate distributions are similar between solutions, 2) differences in emission rate distributions are generally driven by the quantification algorithm, rather than the sensor platform, 3) agreement between CMS and aerial rate estimates varies by CMS solution but is close to parity when CMS estimates are averaged across solutions, and 4) similar sites with similar bottom-up inventories do not necessarily have similar emission characteristics.

Here, we use the air quality model GEOS-Chem adjoint with TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI)-based satellite downscaling to estimate that long-term NO2 exposure is responsible for 2.07 (95% CI 0.91–2.70) million pediatric asthma cases and 1.98 (95% CI 0.52–2.86) million deaths globally in 2019. We attribute these to anthropogenic NOx emissions by sector, country, and season using the adjoint model and provide a recommendation for the most impactful sector and season for NOx emission controls in each G20 country. Discrepancies exist between the health benefits incurred by emission reductions and the emission sector distributions, particularly in countries with emitters adjoining population centers. For example, we find that, if Russian anthropogenic NOx emissions were reduced uniformly by 10% across all sectors, the energy sector, 31% of annual NOx emissions, would account for 47% of pediatric asthma and 49% of premature death health benefits. The season in which these emission reductions occur also affects the magnitude of the health benefit, as seen by the fact that Russian wintertime NOx emission reductions alone are responsible for approximately one-third of the annual health benefits for each health outcome.

Despite their important role, observational records constraining concentrations of atmospheric ice remain severely limited. Although combined radar and lidar estimates from the CloudSat and CALIPSO missions offer over a decade of high‐quality data on ice hydrometeor concentrations, these estimates remain sparse. In contrast, products derived from passive satellite sensors typically provide better spatiotemporal coverage but disagree with CloudSat‐based measurements. To address these limitations, we present a novel climate data record of total ice water path (TIWP), the Chalmers Cloud Ice Climatology (CCIC). It spans 40 years, from 1983 to the present, covering latitudes from 70° $70{}^{\circ}$ S to 70° $70{}^{\circ}$ N. CCIC offers TIWP estimates at three‐hourly resolution from 1983 and half‐hourly resolution from 2000 onwards. We demonstrate the long‐term stability of CCIC by directly comparing it with CloudSat/CALIPSO‐based estimates over the entire mission lifetime. Additionally, we assess CCIC against other long‐term TIWP records, revealing that CCIC yields the most accurate TIWP estimates compared to CloudSat/CALIPSO‐based reference estimates. Analysis of regional 40 year trends across four long‐term TIWP data sets indicates an increase of TIWP over the Southern Ocean and the east Bering Sea in two observational data sets and ERA5.

DeLand;Mark R. Schoeberl,Polar Stratospheric Cloud Observations From the OMPS Limb Profiler,"The frequency and spatial distribution of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) has a strong influence on the magnitude of springtime ozone depletion in polar regions. We use Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) Limb Profiler (LP) satellite measurements to identify PSCs and characterize their distribution. Concurrent water vapor and nitric acid profiles from Aura Microwave Limb Sounder measurements are used to determine the approximate temperature threshold for PSC formation. Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite LP daytime measurements have limited coverage of the polar vortex region during winter months, with increasing coverage as spring equinox approaches. Suomi National Polar‐orbiting Partnership (NPP) OMPS LP observations since 2012 show a relatively consistent seasonal pattern of PSC formation and evolution in the Southern Hemisphere (SH), but significantly more variability during each season and between seasons in the Northern Hemisphere (NH). Comparisons of OMPS LP PSC detections with concurrent Cloud‐Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) observations show good agreement in spatial distribution and seasonal evolution when the CALIOP latitude coverage is screened to the range viewed by OMPS LP daytime measurements. Limb Profiler measurements from current and future Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) satellites will enable us to follow long‐term changes in PSC behavior, such as possible effects of the increased stratospheric water vapor from the Hunga Tonga‐Hunga Ha'apai eruption."

 As an important absorptive component of aerosols in the atmosphere, black carbon (BC) plays a key role in climatic processes. Continuous BC measurements in the atmosphere of Nanjing, China, were performed from 2015 to 2022. By combining data from PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO2, O3 and meteorological variables, the temporal variations in BC during different pollution events were determined in this study. The annual mean BC concentration increased from 2015 to 2018 (0.80 ± 0.05 μg/(m3 a)) and decreased from 2019 to 2022 (0.30 ± 0.001 μg/(m3 a)). The daily variations in BC concentrations during different processes (haze, dust, ozone, fireworks and fog) in Nanjing showed different characteristics. The BC concentration increased the most during haze events (50 %–100 %), while it changed little during fog events, so BC can be used to distinguish between these two processes. During O3 pollution events, the BC concentration increased by 6 %–44 %. During dust pollution events, BC concentration decreased owing to the high wind speed. Besides, BC wasn't a major pollutant originating from Nanjing fireworks. During haze and O3 pollution events, BC concentrations tended to increase (0.45 μg/m3–1.51 μg/m3) as the pollution levels increase. It's worth noting that BC concentrations were higher in autumn (4.85 μg/m3) than other seasons during moderate haze events because of enhanced long-range BC transport. Furthermore, during O3 pollution events, high BC concentrations exacerbated BC-boundary layer (BL) interactions and sustained high O3 concentrations. Bimodal distribution of haze (O3) pollution at all levels, but the nocturnal BC concentration peak weakened during heavy haze events."

The variance of vertical velocity from millimeter wave cloud radar (MMCR) can accurately capture the diurnal evolution of the CBLH, due to a small blind range and less impact by the residual layer. The CBLH is affected by radiation, humidity, cloud, and precipitation; thus, the MMCR is suitable for monitoring the CBLH, owing to its observation capability in various weather conditions. 
 Using the vertical velocity (w) observed by a Ka-band millimeter wave cloud radar (MMCR) at Wuhan, we investigate the evolution of the convective boundary layer height (CBLH) based on a specified threshold of vertical velocity variance (σw2). The CBLHs from the MMCR w in the selected durations are compared with those estimated by the lidar range-corrected signal (RCS) and radiosonde temperature based on different algorithms, showing good agreement with each other. Although these algorithms are based on different dynamic and thermodynamic effects, the diurnal evolution of the CBLH from MMCR is generally consistent with that from lidar, except for a few hours post-sunrise and pre-sunset due to the influence of the aerosol residual layer on the lidar RCS. Meanwhile, the CBLH from MMCR shows less variation with the occurrence of sand and dust and a swifter response for thick clouds relative to that from lidar. In this case, σw2 of the MMCR w identifies the CBLH based on a dynamic effect, which can accurately capture the diurnal evolution of the CBLH compared with that from the change in long-time-mixing aerosol concentration. The monthly and seasonal features of the CBLH at Wuhan are revealed via the MMCR measurement. Hence, considering that the MMCR is capable of continuous observation in various weather conditions, the MMCR w with high resolution can be applied for monitoring the evolution of the CBLH in different atmospheric conditions, which is helpful for improving our comprehensive understanding of the convective boundary layer (CBL) and dynamic processes in the CBL."

Twelve months of Atmospheric Radiation Measurements (ARM) during the Eastern Pacific Cloud Aerosol Precipitation Experiment (EPCAPE) at Scripps Pier in La Jolla, California, showed the highest NSS sulfate mass concentrations occurred for the northwesterly back-trajectories over 64% of the year, with an average of 0.90 μg/m3 that contributed 76% of annual NSS sulfate concentration. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and a refractory black carbon tracer method attributed 76–80% of the regionally emitted sulfur dioxide (SO2) sources of submicron NSS sulfate to marine biogenic emissions and 20–24% to shipping emissions. MLR for oxidation processes explained 21% of the variability with Downwelling Shortwave Radiation (DSW) driving photochemical reactions to account for 34% of annual regional sulfate production, Upwind Cloud Vertical Fraction (UCVF) controlling cloud-associated oxidation to account for 29%, and relative humidity (RH) describing aerosol-phase oxidation to account for 36%.

This study investigated the spatial variation of the association between long‐term exposure to particulate matter (PM) air pollution and cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence and their relevant regional characteristics. We selected 155,017 adults who have lived over 13 years in each of the 16 regions of South Korea from the National Health Insurance Service‐National Sample Cohort. We assessed the individual long‐term exposure as a 5‐year average concentration at district‐level residential addresses estimated by previously validated exposure prediction models. We applied time‐dependent Cox‐proportional hazard models to explore the spatial variation of long‐term PM exposure's association with CVD incidence. After adjusting for individual‐level characteristics, we estimated the region‐specific hazard ratios (HRs) of incident CVD per 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10 and PM2.5. Then, we calculated the correlation coefficients between region‐specific HRs and 80 regional attributes in 13 categories across 16 regions to identify the related regional characteristics. Region‐specific HRs of CVD incidence for PM showed considerable variation in magnitude and direction across 16 regions. HRs of PM10 and PM2.5 were higher in major urban areas and lower in rural areas. Urbanicity and emission sources exhibited significant correlations with HRs of overall CVD.

 Against the background of global warming, the increasing frequency of extreme high-temperature events (EHTF) in East China poses a huge threat to societal development and public health, and this was starkly demonstrated by the record-breaking EHTF observed in China in summer 2022. In this study, it was found that the record-breaking dust storm in May 2022 over the Arabian Peninsula accounted for approximately 65.2 % of the abnormal amplitude of July–August EHTF in China in the ensuing summer. Mechanistically, the dust aerosols of this heavy dust storm over the Arabian Peninsula were transferred downstream by the trade winds, whereupon they cooled the Indian Ocean via radiative processes and warmed the Tibetan Plateau through the so-called “snow-darkening effect”. These dust effects persisted until late summer and consequently strengthened the Indian summer monsoon and wetted the Indochina Peninsula. Subsequently, the associated enhanced and eastward-shifted South Asian high and westward-shifted western Pacific subtropical high contributed to the record-breaking EHTF in 2022. A physical–empirical forecast model was developed based on the preceding May dust signals over the Arabian Peninsula, and results showed that it skillfully predicts the interannual variability of July–August EHTF in East China during 2009–2022, and especially the record-breaking amplitude in 2022."

 Understanding and predicting pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) thunderclouds is challenging due to their unpredictable nature and potential to exacerbate wildfires. This study employs a three-dimensional (3D) numerical model with a non-inductive electrification mechanism to explore how fire-produced aerosol concentrations influence the charge structure and lightning activity in pyroCb. Aerosol particle concentrations ranging from 100 to 20,000 cm−3 were considered to generate realistic thundercloud charge structures, with the cumulus cloud setup based on environmental conditions derived from an inverted-V sounding profile. The SP98 non-inductive electrification scheme models charge transfer in pyroCb, and the Poisson equation is solved to identify regions where lightning discharges are likely to initiate, though actual discharges are not simulated. For aerosol concentrations between 500 and 5000 cm−3, negative non-inductive charging dominates, while extreme aerosol cases (≥5000 cm−3) enhance positive charging at altitudes of 3–7 km. These findings suggest that non-inductive charge separation between ice crystals and graupel leads to realistic charge structures under pyroconvective conditions simulated in this study, reflecting moderate-to-high aerosol environments characteristic of wildfire-driven pyroCb events. As aerosol concentrations increase from 500 to 5000 cm−3, the charge structure evolves from a dipole to a tripole (at 1000 cm−3) and eventually to an inverted dipole, enabling intra-cloud (IC) and negative cloud-to-ground (-CG) lightning. At higher concentrations (10,000–20,000 cm−3), a multi-layer charge configuration emerges, favoring intense positive cloud-to-ground (+CG) strokes. Sensitivity analysis reveals that low-to-moderate aerosol levels with strong wind shear promote IC lightning, while high aerosol levels favor +CG flashes. These findings highlight the complex interactions driving pyroCb dynamics and the importance of integrated modelling to predict wildfire-induced thunderstorms."

Using satellite observations and meteorological data, we demonstrate that the inverted V primarily reflects co-variability between LWP and Nd. We suggest taking a holistic approach that considers this co-variability when assessing the climatological sensitivity of LWP to anthropogenic aerosols. 
 Climatological data of the liquid water path (LWP) and droplet concentration (Nd) often reveal an inverted-V relationship, where LWP increases and then decreases as Nd increases. Our findings show that while this LWP response to an increase in Nd aligns with proposed causal mechanisms, such as entrainment evaporation feedback and precipitation suppression, the inverted-V pattern is primarily driven by the co-variability between LWP and Nd. This co-variability arises from (1) large-scale meteorology, which controls both LWP and Nd, causing them to vary in opposite directions simultaneously, and (2) microphysical processes, where an increase in LWP is typically accompanied by a decrease in Nd. Consequently, we suggest that the inverted-V sensitivity should not be used as evidence for positive radiative forcing through LWP adjustments to aerosols as it is largely explained by co-variability. We further demonstrate that the inverted-V relationship essentially reflects the climatological evolution of Stratocumulus clouds (Sc).

Data from 32 research flights in 2023 reveal seasonal patterns and correlations with conventional measurements.

The study demonstrates the ArcticShark’s versatility in bridging data gaps and improving the understanding of vertical atmospheric structures. 
 This study presents the unique capability of the Department of Energy (DOE) ArcticShark – a mid-size fixed-wing uncrewed aerial system (UAS) – for measuring vertically resolved atmospheric properties over the Southern Great Plains (SGP) of the United States. Focusing on atmospheric states, such as ambient temperature, wind, and aerosol properties, we overview measurements from 32 research flights (∼ 97 flight hours) in 2023. The August operations, aided by a visual observer on a chase plane, allowed for extensive UAS coverage, surpassing typical UAS operation envelopes. Our data from March, June, and August 2023 reveal distinctive seasonal patterns within the atmospheric column through unique chemical composition measurements. In situ measurements combined with remote sensing retrievals and radiosonde measurements provided valuable insights into their consistency and complementarity. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capabilities of the ArcticShark through several case studies, including the analyses of correlations between UAS-derived atmospheric profiles and conventional radiosonde measurements, as well as the derivation of vertically resolved profiles of aerosol chemical, optical, and microphysical properties. These case studies highlight the versatility of the ArcticShark UAS as a powerful tool for comprehensive atmospheric research, effectively bridging data gaps and enhancing our understanding of vertical atmospheric structures in the region."

However, little is known about the magnitude of value-chain H2 emissions due to a lack of empirical measurements, the unavailability of precise, fast sensor technology, and the lack of established methods for emission quantification. In this study, a novel prototype H2 sensor was deployed in a state-of-the-art mobile laboratory to demonstrate that H2 emissions can be accurately quantified using downwind measurement techniques and analytics commonly used for other gases. A series of controlled H2 release experiments were conducted with the corelease of multiple tracer gases. Tracer flux ratio and physics-based Bayesian plume model inversion methodologies were used to quantify the H2 emission rates. We show that the H2 sensor detects parts-per-billion or higher concentration enhancements downwind of the H2 emission source within seconds, and the similar plume structures of H2 and tracer gases confirm their codispersion in the atmosphere. This enables the quantification of H2 emission rates at an accuracy comparable to that of other well-studied gases."

PUF efficiently collects SVOCs with moderate to low volatility, but applications are limited for the more volatile SVOCs due to breakthrough from the PUF trap. The collection efficiency can be predicted by frontal chromatography theory with knowledge of several parameters: the sampled air volume, the breakthrough volume which depends on the PUF/air partition ratio (KPA), and the number of theoretical plates (N) in the PUF trap. Here we evaluate data from two Canadian air monitoring programs in which front and back PUF traps (P1 and P2) were used to check for breakthrough, as indicated by the back/front ratio (P2/P1) of collected SVOCs. A frontal chromatography model was used to relate collection efficiency of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and α-hexachlorocyclohexane (α-HCH) to their observed P2/P1 ratios under assumed scenarios of KPA and N, and apparent N-values for the PUF traps were derived.

 Multiple satellites are currently in orbit around the Earth, providing reliable and consistent estimates of the column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of CO2, i.e., XCO2. However, the satellite datasets suffer spatiotemporal gaps due to the narrow swath widths and the influence of clouds and aerosols. Model-derived CO2 datasets can fill these gaps; however, these model datasets lack the consistency of the satellite observations. Scientists are continually refining their methods to improve the accuracy of the model datasets. Therefore, regular evaluation of the model estimates against precise datasets is imperative to confirm their reliability. In our study, we extensively evaluated the performance of two widely used models, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) CarbonTracker and the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), by comparing their CO2 datasets with the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 3 (OCO-3) XCO2 retrievals utilizing three years of data from 2020 to 2022. The results showed that overall, the CarbonTracker dataset was underestimated by -0.08 ± 0.38 ppm with an RMSE of 0.98 ppm, and the CAMS estimates were overestimated by 0.34 ± 0.43 ppm with an RMSE of 1.05 ppm. For a more detailed assessment, we compared the model and the satellite datasets separately over 10 regions of the world in terms of spatial distribution, monthly changes, seasonal variations, latitudinal distribution, and annual XCO2 growth rates. The model datasets exhibited good consistency with the satellite observations in most regions. However, significant discrepancies were observed in areas such as the Tibetan Plateau, the Himalayan Mountain ranges, equatorial Africa, and the Amazon."

 The impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown on thunderstorm properties, influenced by changes in air quality, were investigated in Northeastern (Kohima, 25.66° N, 94.08° E) and Eastern (Rampurhat, 24.17° N, 87.78° E) India using seven years of ground-based observations. During the lockdown period (LP), Cloud-to-ground (CG) flashes decreased by 67 % and 51 % over Kohima and Rampurhat respectively. Reductions were noted in the number of thunderstorms and various intensity parameters such as duration, flashes per thunderstorm, Peak Flash Rate (PFR), IC: CG ratio, and lightning peak currents. Significant changes in anthropogenic aerosols were observed, with notable reductions in SO₂, NO₂, and PM₁₀ levels. Regardless of the specific raindrop formation mechanism in the two regions, higher concentrations of moderate to larger raindrops were observed during LP. Also, the mixed-phase region of thunderstorms shows a reduction in water content (both liquid and ice) in the mixed phase and the total column. Daily-scale analysis reveals non-linear associations between pollutant concentrations and CG flashes in both regions, with relative humidity (RH) potentially influencing these relationships. Overall, thunderstorm intensity parameters, mixed-phase processes, and rain DSDs were associated with reduced pollutant concentrations during LP. The similarity of trends in multiple parameters during PLP-LP-ALP aligns with established facts, affirming that reduced pollutants lead to noticeable changes in thunderstorm characteristics. The partial rebound of pollutants and other parameters during ALP remained below pre-lockdown levels, which might suggest the lasting impacts of reduced human activities on atmospheric conditions. Further research is necessary to confirm if these measures could mitigate climatic changes and potentially guide policymakers in addressing such changes."

BC particles are emitted from combustion sources as open-structured fractal aggregates. After emission, BC is often compacted due to capillary condensation of semivolatile vapors to form coatings. The addition of coatings influences the size and radiative properties of BC, but representing these details in radiative transfer models is computationally difficult and often neglected. Laboratory studies have measured BC restructuring during coating but rarely provide information on changes in particle shape. Here, we combine laboratory measurements of BC compaction with detailed restructuring models to develop a framework for predicting the size and shape of BC as a function of coating volume ratio, a property already tracked in large-scale atmospheric models. The framework predicts the mobility diameter and fractal dimension of BC particles as a function of coating volume throughout compaction with root-mean-squared error (RMSE) values less than 6.8 and 4.3%, respectively. These properties are predicted for both the coated particle and the BC core. Our proposed framework will enable a more complete representation of the evolving size and shape of BC throughout its atmospheric lifetime, thereby improving model accuracy at a low computational cost."

The expected decrease of anthropogenic aerosol concentrations is found both to modify the future evolution of shortwave radiation and to generate an extra warming. For every tenth in aerosol optical depth drop in Central Europe, shortwave radiation is increased at the surface by 6.3 Wm−2 $\mathrm{W}{\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$ and decreased at the top of the atmosphere by 5.6 Wm−2 $\mathrm{W}{\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$, while near‐surface temperature is increased by 0.3° ${}^{\circ}$C.

Two approaches have emerged as most viable: Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI) and Marine Cloud Brightening. This study identifies a substantial but unrecognized source of cloud brightening caused by SAI, which we call “diffusion‐brightening”; essentially, diffusion of the radiation field that would accompany SAI can result in sunlight entering clouds at steeper angles, which increases cloud albedo without actively injecting aerosols into clouds. We present idealized calculations that suggest the diffusion‐brightening effect can lead to clouds reflecting about 10% more of the incoming sunlight depending on stratospheric aerosol, cloud, and Sun conditions. We show that the radiative effect of diffusion‐brightening could exceed that of stratospheric aerosol reflection in many cloudy scenes, which has global relevance given that clouds cover around two‐thirds of the planet."

Estimates suggest that the number of satellites in an LEO could exceed 60,000 by 2040. The increase in the annual mass flux of anthropogenic material into the upper atmosphere as a result of maintaining these megaconstellations could rival the natural occurring meteoric mass flux. Little is known about the aerosols that will be produced by reentry vaporization, which makes estimating the associated impacts on climate and ozone difficult. Aluminum is a primary satellite component that will likely be emitted during reentry vaporization. In this study we simulate a reentry emission of 10 Gg/yr, assuming that all aerosols released is aluminum oxide (Al2O3). This level of Al2O3 emission is consistent with expected megaconstellation growth by 2040. We investigate how the location of atmospheric accumulation, aerosol size distribution, and radiative properties of reentry Al2O3 impacts the middle‐to‐upper atmosphere. We find that depending on reentry latitude and aerosol size distribution, a 20–40‐Gg stratospheric burden of Al2O3 aerosols accumulates poleward of 30 N/S between 10 and 30 km. Small but statistically significant changes in mesospheric heating rates lead to 1.5 K‐temperature anomalies in the mesosphere and the stratosphere at Southern Hemisphere high latitudes. These temperature anomalies are accompanied by a 10% reduction in wind speed in the Southern Hemisphere polar vortex, leading to a weaker springtime ozone hole.

 PM2.5 pollution is a significant contributor to both respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. An aging population is more sensitive to air pollution. Hence accurately predicting PM2.5 concentrations is crucial for safeguarding public health in an aging society. Machine learning is one of the key research methods in the field of PM2.5 concentration short-term forecasting. However, existing short-term forecasting methods often prioritize model improvements, while overlooking the fundamental patterns of PM2.5 concentration data. Utilizing only the temporally closest observations cannot take full advantage of the information provided by historical datasets. Wavelet analysis of datasets in this study revealed the periodic components in PM2.5 concentrations. Building on this periodic variation, we proposed an experience replay strategy that integrates both a long-term and a short-term memory buffer to enhance PM2.5 concentration prediction. The long-term memory buffer stores historical events that are similar to the current pollution scenario, providing the model with a stable historical reference. Meanwhile, the short-term memory buffer captures exceptional samples that are challenging to predict, thus ensuring greater adaptability in scenarios with high variability and uncertainty. The next three-day 5 km PM2.5 concentration grid-prediction experiment was carried out on four typical models in 2020 across China. The results show that the proposed experience replay strategy significantly improv es prediction accuracy on all models. By repeatedly replaying the stored experience, the model progressively strengthens its generalization ability and prediction accuracy, particularly in complex, dynamic, and pollution-prone environments. The proposed approach in this study will contribute to public health protection and environmental management."

However, the effect of various exposure estimation methods on these findings remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate three spatial approaches─nearest neighbor (NN), inverse distance weighting (IDW), and Kriging─for estimating gaseous pollutant exposures and to assess how these methods affect health outcome estimates in fILD patients. A 10-fold cross-validation showed that Kriging had the lowest prediction error compared to NN and IDW, with RMSE for CO = 0.43 ppm (11%), O3 = 5.9 ppb (14%), SO2 = 2.7 ppb (12%), and NO2 = 7.6 ppb (9%), respectively. Kriging also excelled over other methods across wide spatial and temporal ranges, showing the highest spatial R2 for CO and O3 and the highest temporal R2 for SO2 and NO2. In a large cohort of patients with fILD, higher levels of CO, SO2, and NO2 exposure were associated with lower pulmonary function.

Kulie,KAZR‐CloudSat Analysis of Snowing Profiles at the North Slope of Alaska: Implications of the Satellite Radar Blind Zone,"Spaceborne radars provide near‐global observations of clouds and precipitation, but ground clutter can result in a satellite radar blind zone as high as 2 km above the surface. As a result, satellite radars may underestimate snowfall from shallow clouds and incorrectly flag snow virga as snowfall at the surface. Ground‐based radar observations provide invaluable tools to assess satellite observations of clouds and precipitation. This study investigates snowfall regimes using observations from 2011 to 2021 at the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement North Slope of Alaska atmospheric observatory. Snowfall events identified in the Ka‐band ARM zenith radar (KAZR) are separated into regimes based on the cloud/precipitation layer characteristics: deep snowfall, shallow snowfall, and snow virga. The shallow snowfall regime accounts for nearly half of the regime occurrence (48%) followed by snow virga (28%) and deep snowfall (23%). However, more than half (62%) of the shallow snowfall is likely underestimated and/or undetected within the satellite radar blind zone. Snow virga is incorrectly flagged as snowfall for 7% of the total annual occurrence, but increases to 12% in October. The KAZR regimes and vertical structure are qualitatively compared to collocated CloudSat observations with snow certain/possible flags; the deep and shallow snowfall regime show similarities between the ground‐based and spaceborne radar observations. An assessment of observable snowfall occurrence and accumulation at varying reflectivity thresholds in KAZR and CloudSat provide a reference for detection characteristics for current and planned spaceborne radars."

From the first principles, this paper derives the DDA emission estimators with a range of complexity by vertically integrating the 3D continuity equation and simplifying the results under several assumptions and approximations. The connection and difference between the DDA and a widely used divergence method for emission estimation are highlighted. A key difference is that the DDA integrates from the surface to an intermediate altitude instead of to the top of the observed column. This leads to the inherent background removal of the DDA, in contrast to the explicit background removal necessitated by the divergence method theory. Linear fittings are used to account for the effects of topography, chemical reactions, and retrieval biases. Realistic estimators of NOx ${\mathrm{N}\mathrm{O}}_{x}$ emissions using satellite‐observed NO2 ${\text{NO}}_{2}$ column amounts are proposed, leveraging external climatology of the NOx ${\mathrm{N}\mathrm{O}}_{x}$:NO2 ${\mathrm{N}\mathrm{O}}_{2}$ ratio and its directional derivative. These estimators are evaluated within a WRF‐CMAQ simulation of NOx ${\mathrm{N}\mathrm{O}}_{x}$ by comparisons with the model NOx ${\mathrm{N}\mathrm{O}}_{x}$ emissions. The DDA estimators consistently outperform the divergence method estimator, and the DDA estimator that considers both topography and chemistry features the lowest root mean square error. Lessons learned from this study using synthetic model data can be readily applied to the usage of actual satellite observations for emission estimation."

A novel approach of the self-consistent scattering model for cirrus clouds is presented to determine their optical scattering properties at different wavelengths, and their direct radiative effects are calculated with the discrete ordinates method embedded in the ARTDECO package. 
 Cloud–radiation interaction still drives large uncertainties in climate models, and its estimation is key to make more accurate predictions. In this context, high-altitude cirrus clouds play a fundamental role because (1) they have a high occurrence frequency globally and (2) they are the only cloud that can readily cool or warm the atmosphere during daytime, depending on their properties. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of optical scattering properties and direct radiative effect of cirrus clouds based on 4 years of continuous ground-based lidar measurements with the Barcelona (Spain) Micro Pulse Lidar. First, we introduce a novel approach of a self-consistent scattering model for cirrus clouds to determine their optical scattering properties at different wavelengths using only the extinction coefficient and cloud temperature. Second, we calculate the direct radiative effects of cirrus clouds with the discrete ordinates method, and we validate our results with SolRad-Net pyranometers and NOAA-20 measurements. Third, we present a case study analysing the direct radiative effect of a cirrus cloud along its back-trajectory using data from the Chemical LAgrangian Model of the Stratosphere with microphysics scheme for Ice clouds formation (CLaMS-Ice). The results show that the cirrus clouds with an average ice water content of 4.97 ± 5.53 mg m−3, in the nighttime, have a positive direct radiative effect at the top of the atmosphere (TOA; +40.4 W m−2) almost twice than at the bottom of the atmosphere (BOA; +22.1 W m−2); in the daytime, they have generally a negative direct radiative effect at BOA (−11.5 W m−2, 82 % of the cases) and always a positive effect at TOA (+14.2 W m−2). In these simulations, the influence of the lower layer aerosols is negligible in the cirrus direct radiative effects, with a bias (denoted BIAS) of −1.2 %. For the case study, the net direct radiative effects produced by the cirrus cloud, are from 0 to +40 W m−2 at TOA and from −51 to +20 W m−2 at BOA. This study reveals that the complexity of the cirrus cloud direct radiative effect calculation lies in the fact that it is highly sensitive to the cirrus scene properties."

Wu;Joseph A. Santanello;Jie Gong;Chi Ao;Panagiotis Vergados;Kevin J. Nelson,Exploring commercial Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) products for planetary boundary layer studies in the Arctic,"This study explores the potential of two newly launched commercial Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) satellite missions for advancing Arctic lower-atmospheric studies. The products have a good sampling of the lower Arctic atmosphere and are useful to derive the planetary boundary layer (PBL) height during winter months. This research is a step towards closing the observation gap in polar regions due to the decomissioning of Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC-1) GNSS RO mission and the lack of high-latitude coverage by its successor (COSMIC-2). 
 Commercial radio occultation (RO) satellites that utilize the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are emerging as key tools for observing the polar regions, which are not covered by the second-generation Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC-2) mission. This study evaluates the value of commercial RO measurements, specifically Spire and GeoOptics, for planetary boundary layer (PBL) investigations in the Arctic, a region where favorable lower-atmospheric penetration of GNSS RO is vital for observing the persistently shallow PBL. The lower tropospheric penetration capability of both Spire and GeoOptics over the Arctic Ocean, with nearly 80 % observations reaching an altitude of 500 m above mean sea level, is comparable to other RO missions such as the current Meteorological Operational satellite programme (MetOp) and the discontinued COSMIC-1 missions. A seasonal cycle in RO penetration probability, with the minimum occurring during the Arctic warm season, was observed in most RO datasets, except NASA-purchased Spire data. Monthly mean Arctic PBL height (PBLH) derived from Spire and GeoOptics compares well with MetOp observations and the reanalysis from Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2). A minimum penetration threshold of 500 m generally suffices for determining Arctic PBLH, although a 300 m threshold improves performance of NASA-purchased Spire data. Arctic PBLH representation is influenced less by the number of observations or instrument type and more by the algorithms used for bending angle and refractivity retrievals. These findings underscore the importance of processing algorithms in achieving accurate lower-atmospheric soundings and Arctic PBLH representation."

The model provides AOD at a 3 km × 3 km spatial and 15 min temporal resolution over Europe. It accurately captured multi-layer AOD dynamics during Saharan dust transport and the Mount Etna eruption, demonstrating consistent physical accuracy. 
 Multi-layer aerosol optical depth (AOD) estimation with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution is crucial for effective aerosol monitoring, given the significant variations over time and space. While ground-based observations provide detailed vertical profiles, satellite data are essential for addressing the spatial and temporal gaps. This study utilizes profiles from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) and data from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) to estimate vertical AOD values at 1.5, 3, 5, and 10 km layers. These estimations are achieved with spatial and temporal resolutions of 3 km × 3 km and 15 min, respectively, over the European troposphere. We employed machine learning models – XGBoost (XGB) and random forest (RF) – trained on SEVIRI data from 2017 to 2018 for the estimations. Validation using CALIOP AOD retrievals in 2019 confirmed the reliability of our findings, emphasizing the importance of wind speed (Ws) and wind direction (Wd) in improving AOD estimation accuracy. A comparison between seasonal and annual models revealed slight variations in accuracy, leading to the selection of annual models as the preferred approach for estimating SEVIRI multi-layer AOD values. Among the annual models, the XGB model demonstrated superior performance over the RF model at all four layers, yielding more reliable AOD estimations with R2 values of 0.99, 0.97, 0.98, and 0.98 for the four layers from low- to high-altitude layers. Further validation using data from European Aerosol Research Lidar Network (EARLINET) stations across Europe in 2020 indicated that the XGB model still achieved better agreement with EARLINET AOD profiles, with R2 values of 0.86, 0.80, 0.75, and 0.59 and RMSE values of 0.022, 0.012, 0.015, and 0.005. We performed a qualitative validation of multi-layer AOD estimations by comparing spatial trends with CALIOP AOD retrievals for SEVIRI pixels on four dates in 2019, showing strong agreement across varying AOD levels. Additionally, the model successfully estimated AOD at 15 min intervals for two real events – a Saharan dust plume and the Mount Etna eruption – revealing consistent physical characteristics, including long-range transport in the upper layers and a gradual increase in AOD from lower to higher tropospheric layers during volcanic events. The results demonstrate that the proposed method facilitates comprehensive monitoring of AOD behavior throughout the four vertical layers of the troposphere, offering important insights into the dynamics of aerosol occurrence."

Temperature profiles from the near surface to 60 km are derived by pure rotational Raman and Rayleigh scattering techniques using a single integrated lidar system. The results prove the system can make fine measurements of the atmospheric temperature profiles from the near surface to 60 km. 
 Accurate measurement of atmospheric temperature profiles from the surface to the stratosphere is crucial for understanding atmospheric dynamics and climate processes. Traditional methods, such as the use of radiosondes, are limited in spatial and temporal coverage. To address this challenge, a dual-field, integrated lidar system was developed based on the principles of pure rotational Raman scattering and Rayleigh scattering principles to precisely detect atmospheric temperatures in both the troposphere and stratosphere from the near surface to 60 km altitude. The system utilized a 532 nm pulsed laser with 200 mJ and 50 Hz, utilizing a dual-field-of-view (DFOV) setup to receive atmospheric backscatter signals. Pure rotational Raman signals from 5–30 km and Rayleigh signals from 30–60 km are collected using a 800 mm aperture telescope, while a smaller 200 mm aperture telescope receives pure rotational Raman signals below 5 km. By combining these signals, the system derives continuous temperature profiles from the surface to 60 km using a single lidar system. The observed temperature data were compared with simultaneous radiosonde and atmospheric model data. Below 16 km, the lidar-derived temperatures exhibited strong agreement with radiosonde data, with a correlation coefficient of 0.95 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.2 K. Between 30 and 60 km, lidar-derived temperatures were also in strong agreement with model data, achieving a correlation coefficient of 0.88. These continuous temperature profiles will support the study of fluctuation phenomena in the middle and upper atmosphere, particularly when integrated with high-altitude observations from sodium fluorescence Doppler lidar operating at 80–105 km in future studies. This integrated lidar system serves as a critical tool for achieving continuous atmospheric measurement across multiple layers, contributing significantly to atmospheric science and remote sensing applications."

To address this gap, this study derives a new formulation of FMF as a function of the Ångström exponent (AE) based on over 20 years of AERONET measurements. Our results reveal a consistent FMF‐AE relationship across continental regions, supporting the feasibility of globally estimating FMF through a simple empirical function based on AE. Validation with independent NOAA GML data sets shows predicted FMF errors mostly within 0.1. Finally, applying this parameterization to MODIS Aqua and Terra data significantly improved satellite‐derived FMF agreement with AERONET compared to previous derivations. This parameterization provides a simple, valuable tool for accurately deriving FMF over land from MODIS and understanding its impact on climate and air quality."

Most operational air quality forecast (AQF) models estimate smoke emissions based on the latest available satellite fire products, which may not represent real‐time fire behaviors without considering fire spread. Hence, a novel machine learning (ML) based fire spread forecast model, the Fire Intensity and spRead forecAst (FIRA), is developed for AQF model applications. FIRA aims to improve the performance of AQF models by providing realistic, dynamic fire characteristics including the spatial distribution and intensity of fire radiative power (FRP). In this study, data sets in 2020 over the continental United States (CONUS) and a historical California fire in 2024 are used for model training and evaluation. For application assessment, FIRA FRP predictions are applied to the Unified Forecast System coupled with smoke (UFS‐Smoke) model as inputs, focusing on a California fire case in September 2020. Results show that FIRA captures fire spread with R‐squared (R2) near 0.7 and good spatial similarity (∼95%). The comparison between UFS‐Smoke simulations using near‐real‐time fire products and FIRA FRP predictions show good agreements, indicating that FIRA can accurately represent future fire activities. Although FIRA generally underestimates fire intensity, the uncertainties can be mitigated by applying scaling factors to FRP values. Use of the scaled FIRA largely outperforms the experimental UFS‐Smoke model in predicting aerosol optical depth and the three‐dimensional smoke contents, while also demonstrating the ability to improve surface fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations affected by fires."

 Most major field campaigns, such as the Southern Africa Fire Atmosphere Research Initiative (SAFARI-92 and SAFARI-2000) and AErosol, RadiatiOn and CLOuds in southern Africa (AEROCLO-sA), have focused on the west coast of southern Africa, leaving the east coast underexplored. To address this, the Biomass Burning Aerosol Campaign (BiBAC) was initiated by the IRP ARSAIO (International Research Project – Atmospheric Research in Southern Africa and Indian Ocean) during the 2022 biomass burning season to study aerosol optical properties over southern Africa and the southwestern Indian Ocean (SWIO). This study analyzes aerosol properties during the intensive observation period (IOP) of BiBAC at Skukuza in Kruger National Park during two events: 18–23 September (Event 1) and 9–17 October (Event 2). Sun-photometer data, consistent with CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization), revealed a predominance of biomass burning aerosols. Transport analyses show southeastward movement of carbon monoxide (CO) and aerosols, reaching up to 6 km during Event 1 and 10 km during Event 2. Synoptic conditions, including frontal systems and baroclinic waves, drove regional and intercontinental pollutant transport, impacting the Mozambique Channel and surrounding areas. A “river of smoke” observed in Event 1 suggests novel synoptic conditions compared to previous studies. This study is the first to highlight two distinct transport mechanisms of aerosol plumes and CO from southern Africa and South America toward the SWIO basin, underscoring the significance of east-coast observations in understanding regional and global atmospheric dynamics."

Hegglin,On the estimation of stratospheric age of air from correlations of multiple trace gases,"This study refines estimates of the stratospheric “age of air”, a measure of how long air circulates in the stratosphere. By analyzing correlations between trace gases measurable by satellites, the research introduces a method that reduces uncertainties and detects small-scale atmospheric features. This improved understanding of stratospheric circulation is crucial for better climate models and predictions, enhancing our ability to assess the impacts of climate change on the atmosphere. 
 The stratospheric circulation is an important element in the climate system, but observational constraints are prone to significant uncertainties due to the low circulation velocities and uncertainties in available trace gas measurements. Here, we propose a method to calculate mean age of air as a measure of the circulation from observations of multiple trace gas species which are reliably measurable by satellite instruments, like trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11), dichlorodifluoromethane (CFC-12), chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and we show that this method works well in most of the lower stratosphere up to a height of about 25 km. The method is based on the compact correlations of these gases with mean age. Methodological uncertainties include effects of atmospheric variability, non-compactness of the correlation, and measurement related effects inherent for satellite instruments. The multi-species age calculation method is evaluated in a model environment and compared against the actual model age from an idealized clock tracer. We show that combination of the six chosen species reduces the resulting uncertainty of derived mean age to below 0.3 years throughout most regions in the lower stratosphere. Even small-scale, seasonal features in the global age distribution can be reliably diagnosed. The new correlation method is further applied to trace gas measurements with the balloon-borne Gimballed Limb Observer for Radiance Imaging of the Atmosphere (GLORIA-B) instrument. The corresponding deduced mean age profiles agree reliably with SF6-based mean age below about 22 km and show significantly lower uncertainty ranges. Comparison between observation-based and model-simulated mean ages indicates a slow-biased circulation in the ERA5 reanalysis. Overall, the proposed mean age calculation method shows promise to substantially reduce the uncertainty in mean age estimates from satellite trace gas observations."

During the westerly QBO, positive zonal wind anomalies at 20−40° S in the upper stratosphere in July, named the positive extratropical mode, lead to a stronger polar vortex in November, with a correlation of 0.75, suggesting that the Antarctic stratospheric polar vortex and ozone concentration in spring can be predicted up to 5 months in advance. 
 The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) dynamically interacts with the extratropical atmosphere. However, the relationship between the QBO in austral winter and the Antarctic stratospheric polar vortex in spring remains unclear. In this study, we propose a joint predictor involving the QBO for the Antarctic stratospheric polar vortex and ozone in austral spring. During the westerly QBO phase (WQBO), positive zonal-mean zonal wind anomalies at 20–40° S in the upper stratosphere in July, named the positive extratropical mode, can lead to a stronger Antarctic stratospheric polar vortex and lower ozone concentration in November, with correlations reaching 0.75 and −0.60, respectively. The mechanism is summarized as follows: the positive extratropical mode triggers a secondary circulation, which further alters the environmental conditions for wave propagation in the stratosphere. The resulting anomalous wave divergence leads to a stronger Antarctic stratospheric polar vortex during the austral spring, while during the easterly QBO phase (EQBO), the correlation between the extratropical mode and the strength of the polar vortex is only 0.1. Due to the stronger upward motion in the tropics, which opposes the secondary circulation induced by the extratropical mode, the EQBO cannot sustain the positive anomalous zonal-mean zonal wind until November. Our results highlight that the extratropical mode during the WQBO could serve as a reliable predictor for both the Antarctic stratospheric polar vortex and the Antarctic ozone hole with a 4-month time lag."

We investigated the interface of single-component and mixed aqueous solutions of atmospherically relevant carboxylic acid and alkyl-ammonium ions using liquid-jet photoelectron spectroscopy. An exponential increase in surface propensity as a function of chain length was found for the single species, and cooperative effects in the mixtures cause a further drastic increase in surface solute concentration. 
 The effects of atmospheric aerosols are key uncertainties in climate models. One reason is the complex aerosol composition which includes a relatively large fraction of organics. Another reason is the small size of aerosols, which makes surface effects and processes important. These two factors make surface-active organics relevant for atmospheric aerosols, as they can affect crucial processes, such as chemical aging and water accommodation, as well as properties such as the surface tension, which drives droplet formation. Two exemplary types of atmospherically relevant organics are carboxylic acids and alkyl amines, and often both are found together within aerosols. In the most atmospherically significant pH range, these exist as alkyl-carboxylate ions and alkyl-ammonium ions. Using liquid-jet photoelectron spectroscopy, tuned to high surface sensitivity, we measured the alkyl-carboxylate anions and the alkyl-ammonium cations of alkyl chain lengths of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, both as single-component and mixed-component aqueous solutions. This enabled us to systematically study how their surface propensity is affected by the length of the alkyl chains and how cooperative ion–ion interactions result in strongly increased surface propensity. An exponential increase in surface propensity is found for the single-species solutions, with cooperative solute–solute effects in mixed solutions of 1 : 1 molar ratio drastically increasing the number of molecules present at the solutions' surfaces up to a factor of several hundred. This cooperative surface propensity is shown to strongly affect the amounts of organics at the surface. These changes can significantly influence radiative forcing via aerosol growth, cloud condensation nuclei activity, and aerosol chemical aging. Our results demonstrate the principal feasibility of a more advanced input of molecular details for creating parameterized descriptions of aerosol surface composition needed to properly account for their impacts in climate models."

No dependence on water vapour was found except for the HO2+NO2 reaction, which can be explained by an enhanced rate coefficient of the NO2 reaction with the water complex of the HO2 radical. 
 The termolecular reactions of hydroxyl radicals (OH) with carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO),  and nitrogen dioxides (NO2) and the termolecular reaction of hydroperoxy radicals (HO2) with NO2 greatly impact the atmospheric oxidation efficiency. Few studies have directly measured the pressure-dependent rate coefficients in air at 1 atm pressure and water vapour as third-body  collision partners. In this work, rate coefficients were measured with a high accuracy (<5 %) at 1 atm pressure, at room temperature, and in humidified air using laser flash photolysis and detection of the radical decay by laser-induced fluorescence. The rate coefficients derived in dry air are (2.39±0.11)×10-13 cm3 s−1 for the OH reaction with CO, (7.3±0.4)×10-12 cm3 s−1 for the OH reaction with NO, (1.23±0.04)×10-11 cm3 s−1 for the OH reaction with NO2, and (1.56±0.05)×10-12 cm3 s−1 for the HO2 reaction with NO2. For the OH reactions with CO and NO, no dependence on water vapour was observed for the range of water partial pressures tested (3 to 22 hPa), and for NO2, only a weak increase of 3 % was measured,  in agreement with the study by Amedro et al. (2020). For the rate coefficient of HO2 with NO2 an enhancement of up to 25 % was observed. This can be explained by a faster rate coefficient of the reaction of the HO2–water complex with NO2 having a value of (3.4±1.1)×10-12 cm3 s−1."

Sica;Giovanni Martucci;Alexander Haefele,Solar background radiation temperature calibration of a pure rotational Raman lidar,"Our study presents a new method, the solar background calibration method, which improves temperature determinations in rotational Raman lidar systems. By utilizing background solar radiation, this technique offers more continuous and reliable temperatures independent of external measuring instruments. This new method enhances our ability to monitor and understand atmospheric trends and their association with climate change with greater accuracy. 
 Raman lidars are an important tool for measuring important atmospheric parameters including water vapour content and temperature in the troposphere and stratosphere. These measurements enable climatology studies and trend analyses to be performed. To detect long-term trends it is critical that the calibration of the system and the monitoring of its associated uncertainties are as reliable and continuous as possible. Here we demonstrate a new methodology to derive calibration coefficients for a rotational Raman temperature lidar. We use solar background measurements taken by the rotational Raman channels of the Raman Lidar for Meteorological Observations (RALMO) located at the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology (MeteoSwiss) in Payerne, Switzerland, to calculate a relative calibration as a function of time, which is made an absolute calibration by requiring only a single external calibration, in our case with an ensemble of radiosonde flights. This approach was verified using an external time series of coincident radiosonde measurements. We employed the calibration technique on historical measurements that used a Licel data acquisition system and established a calibration time series spanning 2011 to 2015 using both the radiosonde-based external and solar-background-based internal methods. Our results show that using the background calibration technique reduces the mean bias of the calibration by an average of 0.5 K across the troposphere compared to using the local radiosoundings. Furthermore, it demonstrates the background calibration's ability to adjust and maintain continuous calibration values even amidst sudden changes in the system, which sporadic external calibration could miss. This approach ensures that climatological averages and trends remain unaffected by the drift effects commonly associated with using daily operational radiosondes. It also allows a lidar not co-located with a routine external source to be continuously calibrated once an initial external calibration is done. Furthermore, the technique works for  temperature retrievals using both the optimal estimation method and the traditional temperature algorithms."

FLab was characterized in the field regarding limitations and biases due to different flight maneuvers. Two application cases are presented: analysis of the development of the lowermost troposphere (up to 300 m) and successfully bridging ground-based and aircraft- and radiosonde-based measurements. 
 Uncrewed aircraft systems (UASs) are gradually being established in environmental research to study boundary layer conditions and phenomena in situ; however, due to payload limitations, UASs can typically measure only a limited number of atmospheric variables simultaneously. Here we present the Flying Laboratory (FLab), a hexacopter equipped with six instruments to measure aerosol particles (particle number concentration and size distribution; PM1, PM2.5, and black carbon mass concentration), trace gases (CO2, O3), and meteorological variables (temperature, relative humidity, pressure, wind) in the lower troposphere in real time and with high temporal resolution. The instrumentation has been selected to provide an overview of relevant variables in urban and semi-urban environments and especially in the vicinity of aerosol sources. This paper describes the development of the technical setup of the Flying Laboratory, the characterization of the measurements with respect to horizontal and vertical motion of the UAS, and the optimization of measurement flight patterns. During two field experiments, FLab was applied to bridge the gap between ground-based and aircraft-based profiling measurements and to perform hourly vertical profiling flights up to 300 m above a ground-based reference station for 8 h. These applications demonstrate the capability of FLab to capture the evolution of the lower convective boundary layer during the day and the vertical particle transport in the afternoon up to 200 m above ground."

The use of low-cost sensors (LCS) for air quality monitoring for policy and civic engagement in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has become paramount, as access to traditional reference-grade instruments is still sparse. Yet, studies pertaining to sensor performance under SSA’s meteorological conditions and diverse emission sources are limited. Hence, we tested eight low-cost PM2.5 sensors on the market from different manufacturers containing Plantower PMS, Alphasense OPC-N3, and AVO-Sensor sensors by collocating them with the federal equivalent method Teledyne T640 to ascertain data accuracy, reliability, and responsiveness during wet and dry periods. After 6 months of collocation, PM2.5 concentrations from the LCS showed low intrasensor variability in both the wet and dry periods, but high intersensor variability with the Teledyne T640. A strong relationship existed between the LCS and Teledyne T640, with average coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.7 (range: 05–0.9) and 0.8 (0.64–0.97) in the wet and dry periods, respectively. Larger errors were also associated with LCS data during the dry than the wet period, with the average mean absolute error and root mean squared error, respectively, 4.5 and 5.3 times higher in the dry period. Uncertainties with large errors were also observed with high PM2.5 measured in the wet period, levels that were more common during the dry period typically characterized by long-range transport of PM2.5 pollution. The results show that season significantly affects LCS performance and data quality and that care must be taken during deployment and data usage in SSA, with regular maintenance, particularly in the dry  season. Strong collaborative efforts between governmental agencies, industries, and civil society are needed to come up with an effective framework for their application."

Ambient aerosols sampled in a residential area near the FIP were separated by a cascade impactor into five size fractions (<0.15 to 12.15 μm). Homologues of PFCAs (C5–C11) and five PFECAs were frequently detected in the samples (detection frequencies 40–100%), albeit not in all size fractions. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exhibited the highest concentrations (6.5 to 2900 pg m–3). A noticeable mass mode in the >1 μm size range was observed for PFCAs and PFECAs in the samples that were directly influenced by wind from the direction of the FIP. Based on the PFOA concentrations in the aerosol samples, the emission rate of PFOA to air from the FIP was estimated to be 0.4–1.3 t year–1. Modeling results demonstrated that around 67% of the PFOA air emission was transported in the atmosphere above 1500 m in a 7 day continuous emission scenario, implying that the PFOA on <12.15 μm particles undergoes long-range atmospheric transport after being emitted from the FIP."

 An unexpected dust storm swept throughout China from April 9 to 16, 2023. Many studies have explored the characteristics of the weather system process during this case. However, the distribution characteristics and air-quality effect of this dust storm have been less discussed, especially for the sources of dust. Here, the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) model along with MODIS satellite observations, ERA5 reanalysis data and the HYSPLIT backward trajectory model was used to analyze the transport characteristics and the contributions of dust from different sources during the period of this dust storm. The results showed that dust emissions from North Africa (NA) and the Middle East (ME), aided by atmospheric circulation patterns that facilitate long-range dust transport, collectively led to an increase in dust influx into East Asia (EA). A low-pressure system's eastward journey, starting from NA, passing through ME, and eventually reaching EA, along with the prevailing westerly winds, played a crucial role in this process.During long-range transport, dust originating from NA and ME was typically split into northern and southern branches by the Tibetan Plateau (TP), with the northern branch being predominant. The dust primarily entered EA through the upper troposphere, where the contribution of local dust from EA tended to diminish. Evenly, ME dust was increasingly becoming the dominant source in South China. Despite this, the air quality below 500 hPa in North and 700 hPa in South China was primarily influenced by EA dust. In contrast, dust transported over long distances from ME and NA tended to rise to higher altitudes, thereby impacting PM10 concentrations and air quality in upper layers. This research offered novel insights into the significant role of long-range transported dust during a single dust event in EA."

 Investigating the interaction mechanisms between aerosols and lightning activity is a critical scientific issue in understanding the coupling of urban atmospheric environments with regional weather, holding significant value for extreme weather warnings and climate change adaptation. However, recent studies rarely explain the mechanisms of aerosol impacts on lightning activity from the perspective of atmospheric vertical structure. To address this gap, this study conducted an integrated analysis of multi-source observational data (aerosols, cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning, atmospheric thermodynamic factors, and cloud-related parameters) in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) over nine years (2013–2021). It was found that regions with high aerosol loads in the PRD exhibit a strong spatio-temporal correlation with areas of intense lightning activity. If aerosol influences are considered, the convective available potential energy (CAPE) can better account for the variations in lightning activity peaks during specific years. At the same time, strong convective conditions accelerate the shift of aerosols from enhancing to suppressing lightning activity. From the perspective of atmospheric vertical structure, as conditions transition from clean to polluted, the aerosol-cloud interaction (ACI) mechanism significantly increases cloud particle density by up to 300 %. This not only facilitates the electrification process of thunderclouds but also affects the atmospheric temperature gradient at corresponding altitudes. In polluted conditions (with aerosol optical depth (AOD) > 0.75), the temperature gradient in the middle and upper troposphere decreases by more than 0.5 °C. This enhances the development of inversion layers, thereby increasing atmospheric stability and suppressing convection and subsequent lightning activity. The above findings demonstrate that the promoting and inhibiting effects of aerosols on lightning differ under clean and polluted conditions."

Insights from case studies across diverse climate zones,"Atmospheric delays affect global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals. This study analyses the wet delay, a variable component caused by atmospheric water vapor, using a novel filtering method to examine small-scale turbulent variations. Case studies at five global stations revealed daily and seasonal turbulence patterns. This research will improve water vapour and cloud models, enhance nowcasting, and refine stochastic modelling for GNSS and very long baseline interferometry. 
 Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) microwave signals are nearly unaffected by clouds but are delayed as they travel the troposphere. The hydrostatic delay accounts for approximately 90 % of the total delay and can be modelled well as a function of temperature, pressure, and humidity. On the other hand, the wet delay is highly variable in space and time, making it difficult to model accurately. A zenith wet delay (ZWD) can be estimated as part of the GNSS positioning adjustment and is proportional to the specific humidity in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). While its average term can describe mesoscale events, its small-scale component is associated with turbulent processes in the ABL and is the focus of the present contribution. We introduce a new filtering and estimation strategy to analyse small-scale ZWD variations, addressing questions related to daily or periodic variations in some turbulent parameters and to the dependence of these parameters on climate zones. Five GNSS stations were selected for case studies, revealing promising specific daily and seasonal patterns depending on the estimated turbulence at the GNSS station (buoyancy or shear). This research lays the groundwork for more accurate models and prediction strategies for integrated water vapour, WV (and potentially liquid water clouds), turbulence. It has far-reaching applications, from nowcasting uncertainty assessments to the stochastic modelling for very large baseline interferometry or GNSS."

Temperature, radiation, and relative humidity are the key meteorological parameters and net chemical production is the key process in climate-driven O3 increases in eastern China. 
 We examined the effects of 2010–2045 climate change on ozone (O3) levels in China under a carbon neutrality scenario using the Global Change and Air Pollution version 2.0 (GCAP 2.0) model. In eastern China (EC), GCAP 2.0 and six other models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) all projected increases in daily maximum 2 m temperature (T2max), surface incoming shortwave radiation (SW), and planet boundary layer height and decreases in relative humidity (RH) and sea level pressure. Future climate change is simulated by GCAP 2.0 to have large effects on O3 even under a carbon neutrality pathway, with summertime regional and seasonal mean maximum daily 8 h average (MDA8) O3 concentrations increasing by 2.3 ppbv (3.9 %) over EC, 4.7 ppbv (7.3 %) over the North China Plain, and 3.0 ppbv (5.1 %) over the Yangtze River Delta. Changes in key meteorological parameters were found to explain 58 %–76 % of the climate-driven MDA8 O3 changes over EC. The most important meteorological parameters in summer are T2max and SW in northern and central EC and RH in southern EC. Analysis showed net chemical production was the most important process that increases O3, accounting for 34.0 %–62.5 % of the sum of all processes within the boundary layer. We also quantified the uncertainties in climate-induced MDA8 O3 changes using CMIP6 multi-model projections of climate and a stepwise multiple linear regression model.

This paper presents an update of MAR thanks to which it can precisely decompose solar radiation, in particular in the UV (ultraviolet) and photosynthesis ranges, both being critical to human health and ecosystems. As a first application of this new capability, this paper presents a method for predicting UV indices with MAR. 
 The MAR (Modèle Atmosphérique Régional) is a regional climate model used for weather forecasting and climate studies over several continents, including polar regions. To simulate how solar radiation and Earth's infrared radiation propagate through the atmosphere and drive climate, MAR uses the Morcrette radiation scheme. Last updated in the 2000s, this scheme is no longer maintained and lacks the flexibility to add new capabilities, such as computing high-resolution spectral fluxes.This paper presents version 3.14 of MAR, an update that allows MAR to run with ecRad, the latest radiation scheme provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Operational in the ECMWF's Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) since 2017, ecRad was designed with modularity in mind and is still in active development.We evaluate the updated MAR by comparing its outputs over 2011–2020 for Belgium to gridded data provided by the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium (RMIB) and by the EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility on Land Surface Analysis. Several sensitivity experiments have been carried out to find the configuration achieving the most balanced radiative budget, as well as to demonstrate that the updated MAR is better equipped to achieve such a balance. Moreover, a MAR simulation running ecRad with high-resolution ecCKD gas-optics models has been conducted to produce spectral shortwave fluxes, which are compared to ground-based spectral measurements captured by the Royal Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy at Uccle (Belgium; 50.797° N, 4.357° E) in the 280–500 nm range from 2017 to 2020. Finally, as a first application of spectral shortwave fluxes computed by MAR running with ecRad, a method for predicting UV indices is described and evaluated."

Radiative transfer models (RTMs) play a crucial role in direct data assimilation. In this study, we introduce a new RTM, the Advanced Radiative Transfer Modeling System – Ground-Based (ARMS-gb), designed to simulate brightness temperatures observed by GMRs along with their Jacobians. Several enhancements have been incorporated to achieve higher accuracy. 
 This study proposes a fast radiative transfer model, the Advanced Radiative Transfer Modeling System – ground-based (ARMS-gb), designed to simulate brightness temperatures observed by ground-based microwave radiometers. ARMS-gb employs a clear-sky radiative transfer solver to account for atmospheric thermal emissions, while gaseous absorption is estimated using a statistical regression scheme. To enhance simulation accuracy, particularly in moist environments, seven humid profiles from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County 48-profile dataset are added to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts 83-profile dataset to train the gaseous absorption scheme. Additionally, an advanced water vapor vertical interpolation method is incorporated, offering improved accuracy compared to the interpolation method used in Radiative Transfer for TOVS (RTTOV)-gb. The standard deviation is reduced by 0.15 K in channels with strong water vapor absorption. The Jacobians calculated by these two interpolation modes are also different. To further validate ARMS-gb's performance, simulations using both ARMS-gb and RTTOV-gb are compared against real observations from two ground-based microwave radiometers. The observation minus background analyses demonstrates that ARMS-gb aligns well with RTTOV-gb and achieves smaller standard deviations under high-humidity conditions. Furthermore, the capability of ARMS-gb to monitor the observational quality of ground-based microwave radiometers is demonstrated."

Jin;Yanyi Xu;Xiu Chen;Qing Li,Aerosol Toxicokinetics: A Framework for Unraveling Toxicological Dynamics from Air to the Body,"Exposure to atmospheric aerosols threatens human health and is yet to be effectively addressed globally. Aerosol toxicity strongly depends upon components whose chemical profiles and concentrations can constantly evolve throughout atmospheric transformation, inhalation, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. Despite the abundant studies on aerosol components and their toxic effects, the dynamics in component concentrations and related biological effects from air to the body remain unclear. Here, we propose a conceptual toxicokinetic framework to mathematically deduce the bioavailable concentration from the changing bulk concentration of aerosol constituents in the atmosphere. The biological effects of single or multiple components are further predicted via toxicodynamic modeling according to their bioavailable concentrations. Atmospheric concentrations of toxic composition can in turn be regulated by risk-based guidelines, aiming to alleviate in vivo toxic effects. This perspective demonstrates how serial toxicokinetic–toxicodynamic equations bridge the knowledge gap between ambient aerosols and associated toxic effects in human bodies. The prediction from an inhalation perspective also allows connecting with the exposomes from aggregate exposure pathways. We call for the development of the model validity and integrate quantitative adverse outcome pathways to apply for exposure–disease modeling, providing novel insights into air quality policymaking and public health management."

Ambient aerosol mass spectrometry (AMS) measurements of asphalt-related aerosols near a month-long road paving project showed enhanced ambient OA concentrations with a mix of primary and secondary OA signatures. For comparison, gas-phase emissions from real-world road asphalt samples at application (e.g., 140 °C) and in-use (e.g., 60 °C) temperatures were injected into an environmental chamber and an oxidation flow reactor to simulate varying degrees of oxidative aging while measuring their gas- and aerosol-phase oxidation products. Secondary OA formation was observed via both self-nucleation and condensation, with chemical properties dependent on asphalt temperature and reaction conditions. The chemical composition of less-aged asphalt-related OA observed in outdoor and laboratory measurements was similar to OA from other petrochemical-based sources and hydrocarbon-like OA source factors observed via AMS in previous urban studies. The composition of aged OA varied with the degree of oxidation, similar to oxidized OA factors observed in ambient air. Taken together, these field and laboratory observations suggest that contributions to urban OA during and after application may be challenging to deconvolve from other traditional sources in ambient measurements."

 The microphysical process of glaciation in clouds plays a crucial role in determining cloud dynamics, precipitation, atmospheric heat budgets, and the water cycle. Utilizing a year of global satellite data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA2) reanalysis, this study investigates the impact of aerosols on glaciation temperature (Tg) in deep convective clouds. Our results highlight the critical role of cloud droplet effective radius (re) at –5 °C in determining the Tg, where a greater re at –5 °C (re-5) corresponds to a warmer Tg, indicating the dominant role of the cloud drop size rather than INP. Specifically, the accelerated glaciation process is primarily due to the presence of larger supercooled droplets that freeze more rapidly. Large supercooled cloud droplets may enhance the secondary Ice Process (SIP), which could mask the influence of ice nucleating particles (INPs) in primary ice nucleation. Notably, at a fixed re-5, increasing the concentration of both fine and coarse aerosols has a minimal impact on Tg, indicating that the influence of INPs is weaker compared to the effect of re-5 in determining cloud glaciation temperature. Consequently, aerosols functioning as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) substantially impact cloud glaciation rather than INP. Additionally, we observe that fine and coarse aerosols acting as CCN have significant yet opposing effects on re-5. Although fine and coarse aerosols impact re-5, the re-5 maintains a fairly consistent relationship with Tg. Based on these insights, a multiple linear regression model predicts Tg with a robust correlation coefficient of 0.87, serving as a reference for establishing a parameter space of Tg by re-5 and aerosols, which can be applied for improving climate and global models."

Rieder,Modulation of the northern polar vortex by the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai eruption and the associated surface response,"In January 2022, the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai (HTHH) volcano erupted, sending massive amounts of water vapour into the atmosphere. This event had a significant impact on stratospheric and lower-mesospheric chemical composition. Two years later, stratospheric conditions were disturbed during so-called sudden stratospheric warmings. Here we simulate a novel pathway by which this water-rich eruption may have contributed to conditions during these events and consequently impacted the surface climate. 
 The January 2022 Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha’apai (HT) eruption injected sulfur dioxide and unprecedented amounts of water vapour (WV) into the stratosphere. Given the manifold impacts of previous volcanic eruptions, the full implications of these emissions are a topic of active research. This study explores the dynamical implications of the perturbed upper-atmospheric composition using an ensemble simulation with the Earth system model SOCOLv4. The simulations replicate the observed anomalies in the stratospheric and lower-mesospheric chemical composition and reveal a novel pathway linking water-rich volcanic eruptions to surface climate anomalies. We show that in early 2023 the excess WV caused significant negative anomalies in tropical upper-stratospheric and mesospheric ozone and temperature, forcing an atmospheric circulation response that particularly affected the Northern Hemisphere polar vortex (PV). The decreased temperature gradient leads to a weakening of the PV, which propagates downward similarly to sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs) and drives surface anomalies via stratosphere–troposphere coupling. These results underscore the potential of HT to create favorable conditions for SSWs in subsequent winters as long as the near-stratopause cooling effect of excess WV persists. Our findings highlight the complex interactions between volcanic activity and climate dynamics and offer crucial insights for future climate modelling and attribution."

The findings are helpful for the further understanding of aerosol hygroscopicity in a coastal city and the use of hygroscopic growth factors in models of air quality and climate change. 
 The scattering of solar radiation by aerosol is significantly affected by relative humidity (RH) due to the aerosol hygroscopicity. In order to better understand the characteristics of aerosol scattering hygroscopic growth and its influencing factors during new particle formation (NPF) days, we conducted an in situ campaign from February to April 2022 in Xiamen, a coastal city in Southeast China. The aerosol scattering hygroscopic growth factor f(RH), commonly used to describe the aerosol indirectly hygroscopicity, varies greatly due to the influence of aerosol chemical composition and size. In the relatively clean atmosphere of Xiamen, NPF events occur frequently, and the variation in chemical composition during events has a substantial influence on the aerosol scattering hygroscopic growth. In this study, we investigated the features and influencing factors of f(RH) on the NPF days. The research results emphasized that f(RH) differed significantly between NPF and non-NPF days, mainly impacted by the aerosol chemical compositions, especially sulfate and nitrate. On NPF days, sulfate was the dominant contributor to f(RH), distinguishing it from the non-NPF days. Aerosol hygroscopicity–chemical composition closure demonstrated that NH4HSO4 was the main driving force (30.78 %) of the hygroscopicity parameter κf(RH) when NPF events happened, while NH4NO3 played a dominant role in κf(RH) (up to 35 %) for non-NPF days. Although the uncertainty of the organic aerosol (OA) to hygroscopicity might exist due to the varieties of chemical components and oxidation level, it was the crucial driving factor for the variation in aerosol hygroscopicity. The findings of this study would be helpful for the further understanding of the properties of aerosol hygroscopicity in the coastal area, and it would complement the hygroscopic growth factors in the models of air quality and climate change."

In this work, the size of these droplets is calculated from satellite measurements for the years 2002 to 2005, which is important for the aerosol cooling effect on Earth's climate. These years are interesting because there were no large volcanic eruptions that would change the background state of the aerosols. The results are compared to reliable balloon-borne measurements. 
 Stratospheric aerosol size distribution parameters are derived from the multiple-wavelength aerosol extinction retrievals of the SAGE III/M3M instrument (Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment III on the Russian satellite Meteor-3M) and analyzed for their evolution between 2002 and 2005. The broad wavelength spectrum of the measurements enables us to derive all three parameters within an assumed monomodal lognormal size distribution. The 2002–2005 stratospheric aerosol layer was mostly at close to background conditions but included three moderate-magnitude tropical volcanic eruptions (Ruang, Reventador, and Manam). The SAGE III/M3M instrument measured only at middle and high latitudes, but derived particle size distribution (PSD) parameters indicate a reduction in particle size and an increase in particle number concentration after all three eruptions. In addition to this likely volcanic effect on the PSD, an influence of seasonal polar winter condensation events including meteoric smoke particles on the derived aerosol size is possible, especially due to the long-lasting low stratospheric temperatures during the northern winters of 2002/2003 and 2004/2005. During the same winters, polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) were likely observed by the instrument. A comparison of the derived stratospheric aerosol size dataset with balloon-borne in situ measurements in Kiruna, Sweden, shows generally good agreement, but there are systematic differences below roughly 15 km altitude. Finally, the effect of the necessary assumption of a PSD shape on the aerosol size derivation with remote sensing instruments is shown and discussed."

Noctilucent clouds (NLCs) did not show a clear perturbation in their occurrence frequency, but the slight increase from mid-January to February could potentially have been caused by the additional H2O. It needed 2 years to reach the summer polar mesopause region, analogous to the 1883 Krakatoa eruption that is argued to have caused the first sightings of NLCs. 
 The 2022 Hunga Tonga – Hunga Ha'apai eruption emitted approximately 150 Tg H2O into the middle atmosphere, which is still detectable 2 years after the event. Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) observations show that the Hunga H2O reached the upper polar mesosphere in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) in the beginning of 2024, increasing the H2O mixing ratio in January by about 1 ppmv  between 70 and 80° S up to an altitude of 83 km. No clear signal was detected for the noctilucent cloud occurrence frequency inferred from Ozone Mapping and Profiling Suite – Limb Profiler (OMPS-LP) measurements. It cannot, however, be ruled out that a slight increase from mid-January to February is potentially caused by the additional water vapour from the Hunga event. Several months later, the water vapour anomaly reached the polar summer mesopause region in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) during the noctilucent cloud season in 2024. However, a subsequent anomalous warming during the second half of the season might have hindered the ice particle formation, leading to a decrease in occurrence frequency of the mesospheric clouds compared to previous years. To summarize, based on the analysis performed in the study, we show that the volcanic water vapour needs 2 years to reach the summer polar mesopause region. This resembles the Krakatoa case that is argued to have caused the first sightings of noctilucent clouds 2 years after its eruption in 1883."

Schneider;Ran Zhao,Impact of Wildfire Smoke PM2.5 on Indoor Air Quality of Public Buildings on a University Campus,"With increasing wildfire events impacting many regions worldwide, understanding and mitigating the effects of wildfire smoke on indoor air quality (IAQ) in public buildings are essential for protecting occupant health. This study investigated the impact of wildfire smoke on the IAQ across 24 campus buildings in Alberta, Canada, representing public spaces with varied ventilation systems. Using a network of low-cost sensors to monitor indoor PM2.5, the study identified significant spikes during wildfire smoke events, with 71% of buildings exceeding the Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards daily limit of 27 μg/m3. The buildings had mechanical ventilation systems with filters with different Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) ratings. MERV13 filters were found to be more efficient at capturing PM2.5 particles, resulting in lower indoor/outdoor PM2.5 ratios (0.12 ± 0.07) compared to MERV8 filters (0.28 ± 0.14). Buildings with air change rates (ACH) ranging from 5 to 15 per hour exhibited different infiltration patterns, with higher ACH generally leading to elevated indoor PM2.5 concentrations during wildfire events. This highlights the need to balance ventilation and pollutant infiltration by optimizing ACH rates and filtration efficiency to reduce indoor PM2.5. The trajectory-fire interception method, combined with satellite data, enhanced the identification of wildfire-influenced periods, contributing to a better understanding of smoke infiltration dynamics. These findings underscore that even advanced filtration and ventilation systems alone may not ensure a healthy IAQ during extreme pollution. Real-time pollutant measurements are crucial for effective IAQ management. The findings  offer valuable insights for building administrators and policymakers, helping them develop strategies to mitigate the effects of wildfire smoke and to support healthier indoor environments during wildfire seasons."

We compare the measurements with Mie theory calculations based on optically measured size distributions and with g values derived from hemispheric backscatter (b) measurements using both an integrating and an imaging nephelometer. During the FIREX‐AQ field mission, we measured the optical and microphysical properties of smoke plumes that had been emitted between 0.5 and 8.5 hr earlier. We find that the measured g can only be reproduced from particle size distribution measurements using a higher refractive index than is typically retrieved from remote measurements and assumed in some models. Retrievals performed using the GRASP algorithm suggest the refractive index is wavelength‐dependent with n = 1.55 ± 0.03 at λ = 660 nm and (1.63 ± 0.04) at λ = 405 nm. Using a simple radiative transfer equation, we show that the instantaneous aerosol cooling of the planet by fresh smoke is increased by 20% when evaluated using the measured g values instead of assuming n = 1.52. Besides improving model representations of radiative cooling by fresh smoke, using a more accurate aerosol optical model can improve retrievals of aerosol microphysical properties from remote sensing techniques. Better retrievals will provide a more accurate constraint on the emissions inventories used in global and regional models. This will ultimately reduce the uncertainty in radiative forcing associated with the increasing frequency and magnitude of wildfires."
10.1029/2024JD042916,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,该研究论文主要探讨了利用机载激光雷达和地面监测站观测休斯顿地区对流层低层臭氧的时空变化。研究利用美国国家航空航天局的高光谱分辨率激光雷达-2仪器在2021年9月进行的追踪气溶胶对流实验-空气质量活动中收集的休斯顿市范围内的首次机载激光雷达测量数据，结合地面监测和臭氧探空测量数据，研究城市内的臭氧日变化。研究结果表明，地表测量和激光雷达亚柱之间具有良好的相关性，并且如果对流层排放：污染监测仪器达到其精度要求，该产品可能能够检测到休斯顿等城市上空增强的臭氧，高达55%的近地表亚柱可以捕获臭氧变化，尤其是在超标事件期间。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是空气质量监测、卫星观测（潜力）和大气成分分析。,"['ozone', 'air quality monitoring', 'airborne lidar', 'surface monitors', 'satellite observations (potential)', 'lower troposphere', 'vertical distribution', 'diurnal variability', 'TROPOMI (potential)']",Mary Angelique G.

Satellite observations provide spatially continuous intraurban ozone distributions, potentially filling in gaps within monitoring networks. However, near‐surface ozone is difficult to retrieve from columns due to the large signal in the stratosphere and lack of sensitivity to the lower troposphere in the ultraviolet wavelengths. Airborne lidar measurements of ozone profiles present the opportunity to assess vertical, geospatial, and temporal variability of lower tropospheric (0–2 km) near‐surface ozone subcolumn products for air quality analyses. This study uses the first city‐wide airborne‐lidar measurements collected by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration High‐Spectral Resolution Lidar‐2 instrument over Houston, Texas during the September 2021 Tracking Aerosol Convection ExpeRiment–Air Quality campaign alongside surface‐monitoring and ozone‐sonde measurements to examine ozone diurnal variability within a city. In situ ground measurements and lidar subcolumns were well correlated (r = 0.87) with 2× larger differences observed in the morning than afternoon reflecting the impacts of chemical titration at the surface. Matched ozone‐sonde and airborne‐lidar subcolumns are also well correlated (r = 0.96, bias = 1.3 ppb) suggesting biases between surface and subcolumn ozone reflect vertical distribution variability not instrument biases. Finally, if the Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution instrument achieves its precision requirement, we find this product may be able to detect enhanced ozone over a city like Houston with up to 55% of near‐surface subcolumns capturing ozone variability, particularly during exceedance events."
