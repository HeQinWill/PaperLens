Emma Knowland,From column to surface: connecting the performance in simulating aerosol optical properties and PM2.5 concentrations in the NASA GEOSCCM,"We investigated a climate model's ability to simulate atmospheric aerosols focusing on the relationship between mass and optical properties, by comparing predictions with observations. Our analysis revealed that model errors in aerosol scattering primarily stem from inaccurate particle mass concentrations and relative humidity, rather than flawed optical property assumptions in the model. These findings point out improvements for enhancing the accuracy for aerosols representation in our model. 
 Aerosols are a key climate forcer and harmful to human health at the surface. Accurately modeling aerosol optical properties, mass loading and their relationship is important for constraining aerosol-climate forcing and characterizing particulate matter pollution exposure. We investigate the drivers of uncertainties in the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System Chemistry Climate Model (GEOSCCM) in simulating aerosols by focusing on the link between aerosol optical properties and mass. We compare a GEOSCCM hindcast with long-term coincident observations including satellite AOD measurements, speciated PM2.5 datasets from observations-model data fusion, and ground-based measurements of aerosol mass and optical properties. We analyze regional trends and seasonal variations of AOD and PM2.5, and surface aerosol properties, including relative humidity's role in hygroscopic enhancement. This work also presents the first extensive assessment of GEOSCCM's aerosol component with observational data. Our findings show that biases in PM2.5 components and relative humidity significantly impact simulated aerosol scattering at the surface, while scattering efficiency assumptions align with observations. This indicates that errors in simulated scattering relate more to simulated aerosol speciated mass and relative humidity than optical properties and size distribution assumptions in GEOSCCM. Our work highlights the importance of relative humidity biases on aerosol scattering enhancement for climate models where meteorology is not prescribed. Findings suggest improvements in GEOSCCM aerosols mass and optical properties could be achieved through updating emission inventories, especially over biomass burning regions, reducing nitrate biases, and improving relative humidity simulation."

This study derived a mixing state index from hygroscopicity and systematically investigated the covariation between the mixing state and CCN activity in inland and coastal air. We propose a practical approach for estimating critical diameter from mixing state index, applicable when the aerosol particles are not highly aged. 
 Simplified assumptions of aerosol mixing states in modeling often introduce substantial uncertainties in estimating cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations (NCCN) and their climatic impacts. This study systematically investigates the contrasting relationships between mixing states and CCN activity by combining field measurements of hygroscopicity with the algorithm of entropy at two inland and coastal sites. We show distinct seasonal variations of mixing state. In winter, externally-mixed particles dominated both sites, with comparable mixing state indices (χ) of 0.38 ± 0.12 and 0.39 ± 0.09 respectively for coastal and inland air. However, measurements in summer showed pronounced differences: aerosols in the coastal atmosphere exhibited a higher degree of internal mixing (χ=0.69 ± 0.19), whereas inland χ values only increased moderately to 0.47 ± 0.12. Aerosol mixing state is largely influenced by primary emissions and secondary formation process. Externally-mixed particles originate chiefly from anthropogenic emissions in inland or sea salt in coastal. With the aging process, particles become more internally-mixed as the enhanced fraction of more-hygroscopic mode. Both environments show the negative correlations between the critical diameter (Dcri) and χ but with distinct decrement rates for coastal vs. inland aerosols. Specially, Dcri exhibits heightened sensitivity to fluctuations in χ when χ<0.5. This offers a practical approach to estimate Dcri from χ when the particles are not highly aged. Further analysis reveals that NCCN exhibits heightened sensitivity to fluctuations in χ at low values. These results underscore that mixing states exert different control over NCCN in diverse environments and provide critical constraints for parameterizing fine aerosols CCN activity in models."

Shupe;Corinna Hoose;Matthias Tesche,Occurrence of seeding multi-layer clouds in the Arctic from ground-based observations,"We quantify the occurrence of single- and multi-layer clouds in the Arctic based on combining soundings with cloud-radar observations. We also assess the rate of ice-crystal seeding in multi-layer cloud systems as this is an important initiator of glaciation in super-cooled liquid cloud layers. We find an abundance of multi-layer clouds in the Arctic with seeding in about half to two thirds of cases in which the gap between upper and lower layers ranges between 100 and 1000 m. 
 Studies of Arctic clouds often focus on low-level single-layer clouds (SLCs). Here, we use combined observations of soundings and cloud radar during the MOSAiC, ACSE, and AO2018 research cruises as well as from long-term observations at Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard and Utqiagvik, Alaska to investigate the occurrence of SLCs and multi-layer clouds (MLCs) in the Arctic and to assess the rate of ice-crystal seeding in cold MLCs. MOSAiC observations show cloudy conditions in between 70 % and 90 % of sounding-radar cases. SLCs show occurrence rates of 30 % to 40 % with the highest value of 45 % during October. Cold MLCs are most abundant from November to June (40 % to 55 % of cases). Seeding occurs in about half to two thirds of the identified cold MLCs during MOSAiC for which the sub-saturated layer extends between 100 and 1000 m. The seeding rate increases by as much as 20 percentage points as the assumed size of the falling ice crystals is increased from 100 to 400 µm. The observations reveal a stable rate of cloud-free conditions of around 20 % over the covered latitude range. Cloud occurrence during MOSAiC and at Ny-Ålesund in July, when the geographical distance between observations was minimal, shows reasonable agreement. Comparisons of MOSAiC and other research cruises to the central Arctic also indicate consistent occurrence rates of different cloud types despite the likely effect of year-to-year variability. The comparison of data from ship campaigns and land sites suggests that the latter are not necessarily a good indicator of cloud occurrence in the high Arctic."

We found that non-dust emissions from ships and land-based activities contribute the majority of soluble iron capable of enhancing marine primary productivity, with particularly pronounced contributions in coastal regions and during the summer season. These findings provide improved insight into the influence of human activities on oceanic nutrient supply. 
 Non-dust emissions have been increasingly recognized as important contributors to atmospheric iron (Fe), influencing marine productivity through enhanced bioavailable Fe inputs. However, accurately quantifying the contributions and spatiotemporal variability of non-dust sources remains challenging due to relatively low time-resolution of traditional filter-based analytical methods. In this study, the contributions of non-dust emissions to atmospheric total and soluble Fe in the Northwest Pacific were quantified based on online measurements from three ship-based observation campaigns in 2021–2022. A Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model was applied for source apportionment. Results showed non-dust emissions were notable contributors to atmospheric total Fe, representing 24 %–41 % of total Fe in PM10 and 30 %–56 % in PM2.5 samples across different cruise legs. Importantly, their contributions to soluble Fe were significantly higher, reaching 88 %–97 % in PM10 and 85 %–98 % in PM2.5 samples. Among non-dust sources, land anthropogenic emissions contributed substantially to both total and soluble Fe, whereas ship emission contributed a small portion to total Fe but was a major source of soluble Fe, particularly in summer, when its contribution reached 79 % of soluble Fe in PM10 samples in coastal regions. Additionally, Fe from non-dust sources exhibited stronger spatial variability than dust source. The concentrations of land anthropogenic Fe differed by 3–5 times between coastal and open-ocean areas during the same cruises, while ship-derived Fe varied by an order of magnitude or more. This study offers critical observational evidence to advance understanding of how diverse emission sources shape atmospheric composition in Asian continental outflow regions."

Using a weather prediction model, we simulate clouds in the Arctic during a month. The model is evaluated against observations collected during the ship campaign MOSAiC (Multidisciplinary Drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate). We find that multilayer clouds frequently occur in the region, in fact, they dominate the cloud occurrence. The study highlights the importance of representing these clouds in simulations over the Arctic. 
 Multilayer clouds (MLCs) are common in the Arctic. With a limited-area setup and 2.5 km horizontal grid spacing, 32 ICON simulations from 22 August to 23 September 2020 were analysed to examine the MLC abundance and characteristics across the Arctic. The model was evaluated against observations from the MOSAiC campaign. An immersion freezing parameterisation was developed to capture the local ice-nucleating particle concentration, increasing the cloud ice number concentration by up to 16 % at temperatures above −12 °C. Overall, the model captured most cloudy events with a dry (moist) bias at lower (higher) altitudes. Simulated water paths were underestimated, roughly 3-fold for liquid water and 100-fold for frozen hydrometeors.A 35 %–65 % MLC occurrence, smoothly distributed across the Arctic region, was simulated. Modelled MOSAiC occurrence frequencies span 42 %–76 %, compared to an observed 32 %–59 %. While large differences in the total MLC occurrence are found, two-layered systems occur with a systematic frequency of about 22 %. The sub-saturated layer between cloud layers is typically < 1 km, indicating a high likelihood of the seeder-feeder mechanism (up to 52 %), consistent with observations."

The results show that lactic acid sulfate enhances particle cluster stability and promotes new particle formation, particularly in forested and agricultural regions. These findings highlight the important role of organic compounds like lactic acid sulfate in particle formation, offering insights for mitigating haze and health risks. 
 Organosulfates (OSs) are key components of atmospheric aerosols and serve as tracers for secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. Among these, lactic acid sulfate (LAS) has been increasingly detected in the atmosphere. However, its molecular formation pathways and its role in new particle formation (NPF) remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the gas-phase formation mechanism of LAS via the reaction between lactic acid (LA) and SO3, and assess its impact on sulfuric acid-ammonia (SA-A) driven NPF using quantum chemical calculations and Atmospheric Cluster Dynamics Code (ACDC) kinetic modeling. Our results show that SA and H2O significantly catalyze the LA-SO3 reaction, enhancing the effective rate coefficient by 7–10 orders of magnitude within the temperature range of 280–320 K. Further molecular-level analysis using the ACDC reveals that LAS not only significantly enhances the clustering stability of SA and A up to 108-fold, but also plays a significant and direct role in SA-A nucleation under conditions typical of forested and agricultural regions. Notably, LAS-SA-A clusters contribute to 97 % of the overall cluster formation pathways in regions with high LAS concentrations like Centreville, Alabama. Additionally, our findings show that the nucleation potential of LAS-SA-A clusters is stronger than that of LA-SA-A clusters, aligning with field observations, even though LAS concentrations are typically three orders of magnitude lower than LA. These findings imply that OSs formed through SO3 consumption may significantly contribute to the enhanced NPF rates observed in continental regions."

Kurup;Caroline Poulsen;Steven T. Siems;Daniel J. V. Robbins,Validation and comparison of cloud properties retrieved from passive satellites over the Southern Ocean,"Southern Ocean (SO) clouds are crucial in defining the Earth's radiation budget. They are primarily observed by satellites, due to a lack of surface observations. This study validated cloud top height and cloud mask and compared the microphysics products from 3 satellite cloud datasets over the SO. The study revealed significant differences in cloud property retrievals between the sensors. Multilayer clouds play a major role in the differences when validated with active satellite measurements. 
 The clouds over the Southern Ocean (SO) play a vital role in defining the Earth's energy budget. The cloud properties over the SO are known to be different from their Northern Hemisphere counterparts. As a result, monitoring cloud properties over the SO, including macro- and microphysical properties, is of particular interest.We compared the Level 3 products from AVHRR CMSAF, MODIS, and CALIOP for cloud top height, cloud fraction, and cloud liquid fraction. The study found that MODIS underestimated cloud top heights, while AVHRR CMSAF overestimates them when compared to Level 3 CALIOP. The overall cloud cover for MODIS was less than that of CALIOP while AVHRR CMSAF showed higher cloud cover over mid-latitudes and lower cloud cover over land in the Level 3 product. The comparison of cloud fraction for liquid clouds against CALIOP indicates that AVHRR CMSAF tends to overestimate, whereas MODIS tends to underestimate the liquid cloud fraction. The magnitude of the difference varies with the latitude and season.Following the Level 3 analysis, we investigated three passive remote sensing satellite datasets, MODIS Collection 6.1, AVHRR CMSAF CLARA-A3, and AVHRR PATMOS-x, over the SO. We validated the Level 2 cloud mask, the cloud top height, and the cloud phase for 2015 retrieved from the passive sensors with active CloudSat-CALIOP sensors. We compared the effective radius and cloud optical depth amongst the three passive sensor datasets.This research found that there are substantial uncertainties in the cloud top height, the cloud optical depth, and the cloud thermodynamic phase, over the SO. The extent of which varies depending on the cloud property and retrieval algorithm used. The cloud mask comparison revealed varying levels of agreement between passive and active sensor observations, with a Kuiper Skill Score (KSS) of 0.71 (AVHRR CMSAF), 0.70 (MODIS), and 0.43 (AVHRR PATMOS-x). In the comparison of cloud top height, a mean absolute bias of 0.65 km (AVHRR CMSAF), 1.03 km (MODIS), and 1.27 km (AVHRR PATMOS-x) was observed for single-layer cloud scenes cases. This mean absolute bias increased to 1.87 km (AVHRR CMSAF), 3.25 km (MODIS), and 3.30 km (AVHRR PATMOS-x) for the multilayered cloud scenes. In the comparison of cloud effective radius, it was observed that the disagreement between the passive sensors was more significant in the presence of multilayer clouds. The effective radius disagreement was higher for ice clouds. Variations in ice habit assumptions, lookup table configurations, and phase classification schemes could contribute to these differences. We found that the presence of sea ice strongly influences the retrieval of cloud optical depth at high latitudes, with most passive optical depths higher over sea ice than over ocean. The new finding that contradicts previous studies may result from the difficulty of retrieving cloud optical depth over ice using the retrieval algorithms."

Through comparison and cross-validation with other data sources, this dataset has been proven to have significant advantages in accuracy and applicability. 
 Ecosystem services are the various benefits provided by ecosystems to humans, establishing a crucial link between the natural environment and human well-being. High-resolution ecosystem service datasets can provide more detailed and accurate information, enabling the identification of site-specific differences at local scales. In this study, we produced a high spatial resolution dataset of ecosystem services in China for the years 2000, 2010, and 2020, simulated using ecological process models. Model parameters were calibrated based on literature summaries, ground monitoring data, and reconstructed remote sensing data. The dataset, with a spatial resolution of 30 m, includes net primary productivity, soil conservation, sandstorm prevention, and water yield. The validation results show high consistency between this ecosystem services dataset and both in situ observations and existing datasets. Among the three decades (2000, 2010, and 2020), the overall trends for net primary productivity, soil conservation, and sandstorm prevention in China showed a weak increase, while water yield decreased during this period.

Environment90m is a new dataset, which aggregates 104 environmental variables across the 726 million sub-catchments of the Hydrography90m river network. It includes present and future climate, land cover, soils, topography, hydrographic and streamflow information. Environment90m provides an array of opportunities for research and applications in freshwater science. 
 The current loss of freshwater biodiversity calls for immediate action, including the mobilisation of existing data and tools to support long-term conservation. Yet, establishing a global baseline for the spatial distribution of freshwater habitats and the biodiversity they host remains difficult. Such task would require standardized, high-resolution environmental information to characterise freshwater habitats anywhere in the world. To address this challenge, we present the Environment90m dataset, which aggregates a large number of environmental layers into each of the 726 million sub-catchments of the Hydrography90m dataset, corresponding to single stream segments. Specifically, Environment90m includes 45 variables related to topography and hydrography, 19 climate variables for the observation period of 1981–2010, as well as projections for 2041–2070 and 2071–2100 under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) 1.26, 3.70 and 5.85, and three global circulation models (UKESM1-0-LL, MPI-ESM1-2-HR and IPSL-CM6A-LR). Moreover, Environment90m includes 22 land cover categories for the annual time-series data from 1992–2020. In addition, we provide 15 soil variables and information on aridity and modelled streamflow. Summary statistics (i.e., mean, min, max, range, sd) are provided for all continuous variables, while for categorical data, the proportion of each category is calculated within each of the sub-catchments. The data is available at https://hydrography.org/environment90m (last access: 4 February 2026). To facilitate data download and processing, we provide dedicated functions within the hydrographr R-package, and extend these also to new functions for processing upstream data of lakes. For all underlying calculations, we used the open-source tools GDAL/OGR, GRASS-GIS and AWK, so that custom data can be easily generated using the hydrographr R-package. Environment90m, along with the tools, provides an array of opportunities for research and application in spatial freshwater biodiversity science, specifically biogeographic analyses and conservation exercises in freshwater ecosystems.

Using data from more than five hundred sites, we measured Fe, Mn, Zn, and V in surface soils and found strong regional differences mainly shaped by rock weathering, with added effects of climate and landscape. Our high-resolution maps and uncertainty estimates support sustainable land management and improved predictions under climate change. 
 Soil micronutrient supply sustains critical ecological functions but exhibit poorly quantified distribution patterns in high-altitude ecosystems. This study bridges this knowledge gap through a large-scale investigation across the Tibetan Plateau, a cold-arid region where cryogenic weathering, aridity, and suppressed pedogenesis interact to govern micronutrient cycling. We assembled a plateau-wide dataset from 526 sites with triplicate surface soils (0–10 cm) per site (n = 1660). Four micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Zn, and V) were measured by laboratory X-ray fluorescence (XRF) for all samples and calibrated and validated against inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for a subset of samples.Four micronutrients were paired with multi-source predictors (climate, vegetation, soil covariates, topography, grazing disturbance, and weathering proxy). Elemental contents span broad ranges, with site-level summaries (mean ± SD, mg kg−1) of Fe 22 864.30 ± 7589.01, Mn 576.74 ± 206.44, Zn 27.24 ± 8.55, and V 56.99 ± 19.33. Random Forest model was employed to quantify controls and generate high-resolution spatial maps. Key results reveal that pronounced regional heterogeneity is driven primarily by weathering intensity with secondary modulation from climate and topography covariates. Element-specific spatial patterns were observed, with Fe enrichment in southeastern/southern plateau, Mn gradients increasing southeastward. Zn hotspots in central-eastern and western marginal zones, and V exhibits a moderate spatial gradient, with higher contents in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau and relatively lower values in the northwest. We provide 1 km maps of all four micronutrients together with pixel-wise uncertainty layers to support benchmarking of process-based micronutrient cycling models and to inform sustainable ecosystem management under climate change. Predictions for major elements are robust, whereas trace-level elements, particularly Zn, exhibit comparatively higher methodological uncertainty despite calibration. Accordingly, users should interpret absolute Zn contents with caution and refer to the accompanying uncertainty diagnostics when applications require high-precision estimates. The dataset is openly available at TPDC (https://doi.org/10.11888/Terre.tpdc.303242, Huo et al., 2026)."

Our Structural Evolution Indicator distinguishes real change from temporary planting, revealing that agricultural expansion is driven by Global South countries while the Global North remains stable. This work provides a vital baseline for monitoring food security and environmental sustainability. 
 Accurate quantification of the structural evolution of global agricultural systems is critical for assessing food security and monitoring planetary boundaries. However, current agricultural monitoring is hindered by a baseline that reflects the continuous, annual nature of agricultural management and distinguishes active cultivation cycles from permanent structural changes. Existing products typically rely on fragmented snapshots, multi-year aggregation, or generalized and inconsistent definitions (introducing systematic bias and noise into trend analysis). To bridge this gap, we generated the first Global 30-m Annual Cropland Extent Dynamics (GACED30) dataset (2000–2024). Our continuous mapping framework integrates the gap-free SDC30 to capture the intra-annual phenological transitions distinctive of active cultivation, employs a spectral-semantic sample alignment strategy to resolve the inconsistencies across different cropland sample sets, and applies a rule-based processing to mitigate the spectral ambiguity between active fallow and natural bareland. Furthermore, we derived grid-based Structural Evolution Indicators via continuous statistical trend analysis, utilizing the full 25-year time-series density to rigorously quantify expansion and abandonment trajectories. Comprehensive assessment demonstrates the reliability of GACED30, which achieves a high overall accuracy of 96.5 % and significantly outperforms existing global products (e.g., GLAD Cropland, ESA World Cover and GLC_FCS30D) in capturing temporal stability. Crucially, GACED30 exhibits strong agreement with FAO national statistics, achieving a high correlation in cropland area (R2:0.95) and an 81.1 % consistency in production trends. Based on this consistent baseline, we analyzed the structural evolution of global agriculture, estimating the 2024 cropland area at 1488.5 Mha with a net change rate of 1.2 Mha/year. Our trend analysis reveals a distinct global divergence: structural expansion is heavily concentrated in the Global South (e.g., Africa and South America), driven by commodity frontiers, whereas the Global North is characterized by widespread stability or policy-driven contraction. GACED30 thus provides a reliable evidence base for monitoring the changing footprint of global agriculture.

Addressing the long runtimes and input/output limitations of previous approaches, our agent model accurately reproduces simulations of fine particulate matter and ozone, enabling rapid air quality assessment. 
 Efficient and informative air quality modeling in future emission scenarios is vital for effective formulation of emission reduction policies. Traditional chemical transport models (CTMs) struggle with the computational demands required for timely predictions. While advanced emulator techniques greatly accelerate CTM simulating process, they fall short in providing comprehensive estimates of future air quality due to their limited model structure. Additionally, these emulators often have difficulty simultaneously accounting for varying emission variables and the effects of regional transport, which limits their applicability and undermines prediction accuracy. In this study, an informative future air quality prediction model “TGEOS v1.0” based on the Transformer framework is developed as an efficient agent model of GEOS-Chem v14.2.2. TGEOS is able to efficiently estimate key statistical indicators of PM2.5 and O3 concentrations under future emission scenarios and capture potential extreme pollution events, with approximately 2.51 s to execute one-year estimation. The model incorporates sectoral emissions of up to 26 distinct species as well as the impacts of regional emissions and meteorology on pollutant concentrations, enhancing its versatility and predictive accuracy.

We developed a point-object-detection-based deep learning method for fast, automated detection and quantification of these sources. The model was trained on a large synthetic dataset and tested for generalization using two independent datasets, including simulations and satellite observations. 
 Point sources account for a large portion of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Timely detection, localization, and quantification of these emissions are critical for supporting carbon neutrality efforts. Spaceborne monitoring satellites can provide essential concentration data for identifying point sources. However, existing methods often require human intervention and typically detect plume masks instead of source locations, limiting their utility for regulatory applications. In this study, we present GHGPSE-Net, a deep learning method for greenhouse gas point source extraction. GHGPSE-Net simultaneously performs detection, localization, and quantification of emissions, eliminating the need for traditional segmentation steps. To train and evaluate the model, we construct synthetic datasets using an atmospheric transport model and validate its accuracy against radiosonde profiles and satellite observations. GHGPSE-Net demonstrates desirable performance in the simulation data across detection (F1-score of 0.96), subpixel-level localization and quantification (Pearson's correlation of 0.99, root mean square error of 89.9 tCO2 h−1), tested on ideal instrument of 0.5 km × 0.5 km resolution with retrieval noise of 1.5 parts per million (ppm). The results also demonstrate considerable generalization of the proposed model when tested using two independent datasets. On the identified sources from OCO-3 spaceborne observations, GHGPSE-Net achieves a detection precision of 0.89, localization accuracy of 3.02 km, and a Pearson's R of 0.59 for quantification. The proposed method and datasets provide a valuable foundation for future research towards rapid and automated GHG point source extraction, offering critical data to support swift responses to abnormal emission events."

By integrating updated chemistry, emissions, and aerosol processes, ICON-ART enables detailed, scale-spanning simulations. It supports both scientific research and operational forecasts, contributing to improved air quality, weather and climate predictions. 
 Accurate and efficient modeling of atmospheric composition, including aerosols and trace gases and their interactions with radiation, clouds, and dynamics is essential for improving predictions and understanding of air quality, weather, climate, and related health impacts. The Aerosols and Reactive Trace gases (ART) component extends the ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) modeling framework by enabling online, fully coupled simulations of atmospheric composition processes across scales. ICON-ART includes modules for emissions, transport, gas-phase chemistry, and aerosol microphysics in both the troposphere and stratosphere, allowing for the investigation of feedbacks between atmospheric composition and physical processes from the large-eddy to global scale.This paper presents an updated overview of the ICON-ART framework as implemented in version 2025.10, highlighting recent developments in emission parameterizations, chemical mechanisms, aerosol processes, and coupling to the physical core of ICON via aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions. We summarize the structure of the code infrastructure and demonstrate the model’s flexibility and scalability across a wide range of applications. ICON-ART provides a unified and modular platform for research and operational use in atmospheric composition, bridging the gap between regional air quality modeling and global Earth system simulations."

However, most previous studies rely on the assumption of a constant impact of PM2.5 over time, despite emerging evidence on the time-variant nature of PM2.5-associated health effects. This study aims to assess the temporal changes in the association between PM2.5 and its components and the risk of ischemic stroke. We employed the case-crossover design and included 1,625,763 participants from the Chinese Stroke Center Alliance (CSCA) program. Conditional logistic models were used to estimate the acute effect of PM2.5 and its components on the ischemic stroke onset. Temporal changes in PM2.5 and its components were evaluated across two periods (2015–2017 and 2018–2022) and annually. A 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 at lag 0 day demonstrated a stronger association with ischemic stroke during Period 1 (percent change in risk: 0.54% [0.42 to 0.65%]) compared to Period 2 (0.29% [0.19 to 0.38%]), indicating a significant decline of −0.25% (−0.40 to −0.10%). This decreasing trend was consistent across five PM2.5 components, particularly for black carbon (BC), which exhibited the largest reduction (−4.47% [−7.47, −1.38%]). Nonlinear exposure-response curves for PM2.5 and its components also exhibited a steeper trend in Period 1. By integrating individual ischemic stroke onset data from over 2,600 hospitals across China, our study demonstrates a declining trend in the health effects of PM2.5 and its chemical components on ischemic stroke onset. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for temporal variations in PM2.5-related health effects when estimating disease burden, designing and evaluating air pollution control policies, and informing public health decision-making."

Controlling nitrogen oxide emissions from coal-biomass cocombustion is an urgent challenge. This study develops a novel standalone Chemical Reactor Network (CRN) model to mechanistically elucidate the distinct nitrogen transformation pathways in cocombustion environments. This work reveals an enhanced bidirectional NO–N2O interconversion in the dilute phase, mediated through both direct NCO/NH radical routes and indirect pathways involving NO2 intermediates. The key distinction arises from biomass-volatile induced pathway switching: biomass-derived HCN significantly elevates NCO radical pools, establishing parallel NO-to-N2O conversion channels that create the characteristic emission profile of simultaneous NO reduction and N2O accumulation. Temperature exerts precise regulation, with NO–N2O conversion showing unidirectional characteristics in specific ranges, where higher temperatures promote NO formation via enhanced CH3 radical chemistry. Furthermore, the proposed biomass-coal balancing theory reveals that moderate blending ratios favor HCN → N2O conversion, reducing NO emissions, while excessive biomass shifts equilibrium toward HCN → NO pathways. This threshold behavior provides a theoretical foundation for targeted NOx control in multifuel combustion systems."

Cytotoxicity assays revealed that the presence of precursors such as L-tyrosine (Tyr), L-tryptophan (Trp) and tannic acid during the NH2Cl–O3 process contributed to this increase in nitrogenous and halogenated DBPs and resulted in elevated overall toxicity. Nontargeted ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-Orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry identified diverse halogenated DBPs, with NH2Cl–O3 yielding up to 5-fold more structures and higher abundances than NH2Cl or O3 alone. Taking Tyr as an example, proposed DBP (4-bromophenol, 4-hydroxyphenylacetamide, etc.) formation pathways, involving haloamine-mediated N-halogenation, O3-driven oxidation, decarboxylation, and deamination, were supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, confirming both thermodynamic and kinetic feasibility. Matrix-dependent quantitative validation in Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA) and wastewater effluents showed that concentrations of some identified DBPs reached tens of μg/L, dominated by aromatic halo-phenolics and brominated derivatives. In silico quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) models and cytotoxicity assays indicated that these aromatic halo-DBPs exhibited comparable toxicities to conventional DBPs (e.g., dichloroacetonitrile, N-nitrosodimethylamine), but had a higher toxicity index than BrO3–. These findings highlight trade-offs in water disinfection, underscoring the need for optimized strategies to co-control BrO3– and toxic organic DBPs."

Although atmospheric INP derive from terrestrial, freshwater, and marine environments, their specific sources and microbial producers remain largely unresolved, especially in the rapidly warming Arctic. Here, we examine terrestrial runoff as a driver of INP enrichment during summer in Young Sound fjord, Northeast Greenland. INP concentrations active at −10 °C were significantly elevated in the sea-surface microlayer (SML) and at river outlets relative to underlying seawater, correlating negatively with salinity and distance from freshwater input, highlighting terrestrial runoff as a dominant source of warm-temperature INP. We identify a novel runoff-driven mechanism of SML formation in Arctic coastal waters, whereby terrestrial particles and compounds are transported downstream and selectively accumulate at the air–water interface likely due to their surface-active properties combined with limited seawater mixing driven by salinity gradients. Biological INP were also observed in the atmosphere (1.3–25.3 INP–10 m–3), with sequencing data suggesting terrestrial origins. Our findings demonstrate that terrestrial ecosystems strongly enrich the coastal SML with biological INP, constraining the pool of potential atmospheric INP sources and underscore Arctic coastal interfaces as key regions for cloud-relevant processes under ongoing climate change."

However, the critical role of ambient water in mediating such multiphase reactions on leaf surfaces has often been overlooked. Here, using isotopic tracing techniques, we demonstrate that reactive oxygen species generated in the leaf surface condensate can mediate the oxidation of urea adsorbed on leaves, leading to the formation of nitrite (NO2–). This phenomenon is widespread across various leafy vegetables. At 5 °C and an 80% relative humidity (RH), condensate-mediated oxidation of residual urea on leaf surfaces resulted in NO2– accumulation exceeding the food limit standard. Hydroxyl radicals (•OH), amino radicals (•NH2), and nitric oxide radicals (•NO) were produced during water vapor condensation, collectively driving the conversion from urea to NO2–. Density functional theory calculations verified that radical-mediated transformation occurs spontaneously. Further studies indicate that controlling urea residues on vegetable leaves below 60 ppm and maintaining RH in cold storage below 60% can effectively suppress NO2– formation. Our results demonstrate that water vapor condensation on leaf surfaces can influence the oxidation of organic compounds adsorbed by leaves, providing new insights into the environmental transformation of organic pollutants on plant surfaces."

However, the underlying reaction network governing these advantages remains unclear. To address this, a multiscale analysis was employed to unravel the enhancement mechanisms. This integrated approach combined macro-scale observation using coupled thermogravimetric-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy-mass spectrometry (TG-FTIR-MS), mesoscale validation via targeted experiments with model aromatics and pyrolytic char, and microscale elucidation through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Results reveal that molten hydroxides simultaneously lower the biomass decomposition temperature, suppress tar formation, and activate three distinct hydrogen production pathways: organic catalytic cracking (200–450 °C), deep aromatic volatiles reforming (>500 °C), and char alkalization (>550 °C). Aromatics reforming involves both condensation and ring cleavage. Ring cleavage proceeds via OH– nucleophilic addition and C–H bond heterolysis, with deprotonation as the rate-determining step and the energy barrier governed by the molecular geometry of aromatics. Char alkalization follows fundamental steps with lighter aromatics but encounters higher energy barriers due to its more condensed structure. This work establishes a multiscale mechanistic framework for hydrogen production, paving the way for the rational design of efficient and low-carbon biomass-to-hydrogen technologies based on molten salts."

In this study, the liquid chromatography–photodiode array–high-resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC–PDA–HRMS) method was applied to resolve the molecular fingerprints of BrC emitted from biomass burning and coal combustion. The mass absorption efficiency (MAE) of biomass-derived BrC was consistently higher  than that of coal-derived BrC over the range of 300–500 nm, reflecting  distinct source-dependent chromophoric compositions. A total of 29 chromophores (3.3–4.2 g kg–1) identified in biomass burning explained 35.4–50.3% of the total BrC light absorption, while 20 chromophores (0.4 g kg–1) from coal combustion accounted for 37.0%. Biomass-derived BrC was dominated by lignin pyrolysis products, stilbenes, coumarins, and flavonoids, while coal-derived BrC contained more polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and N/O-containing aromatics. Nitrophenols, such as methoxy nitrocatechol and 4-nitro-3-vinylsyringol, were detected in flaming emissions but absent in smoldering, serving as distinct molecular tracers for combustion conditions of biomass burning.

Despite extensive research on individual pollutants, a comprehensive risk assessment of lubricating oil aerosol mixtures remains limited. This study integrated in vitro cytotoxicity experiments with respiratory deposition modeling to assess health risks of aviation lubricating oil aerosols. Human lung epithelial cells (A549) were exposed to lubricating oil and major components to establish dose–response relationships and elucidate toxicity mechanisms through cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection, inflammatory responses, and apoptosis. The multiple-particle-dosimetry (MPPD) model was employed to simulate aerosol deposition patterns across different respiratory regions under three different exposure scenarios. In vitro experiments revealed distinct cytotoxicity profiles among lubricating oil components, with tricresyl phosphate (TCP) showing the strongest toxicity (lowest observed effective concentration, LOEC = 20 μM), followed by N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine (PAN) (80 μM) and tributyl phosphate (TBP) (100 μM), while base stock demonstrated excellent biostability. Actual aviation lubricating oil exhibited a cytotoxicity threshold at 300 μM. MPPD simulations revealed time-dependent deposition patterns: short-term exposure favored tracheobronchial retention, while long-term exposure resulted in preferential alveolar accumulation. Risk assessment using hazard quotients (HQs) showed all exposure scenarios yielded values well below 1.0. Without adjustment of uncertainty factors, the highest HQ was 8.7 × 10–4; even with the uncertainty factors of 300, the highest HQadj reached only 2.6 × 10–1 under 25-year high-end exposure conditions, indicative of acceptable health risks. This combined study provides quantitative evidence that aircraft cabin environments complying with the WHO 24 h and annual air quality guideline values present manageable health risks."

We find that surface waters in oligotrophic and mesotrophic regions show significant declines in phosphate, whereas nitrate is also slightly decreasing in oligotrophic but increasing in mesotrophic regions. Many coastal areas exhibit nutrient enrichment. Subsurface waters reveal widespread nitrate accumulation, suggesting an imbalance driven by biological nitrogen fixation and reduced vertical mixing. Comparison with Earth system models indicates that current simulations underestimate the pace of nutrient shifts.

Prior studies primarily attribute the ITF decline to changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and Indo‐Pacific winds, but these two processes account for only a fraction of the simulated ITF weakening (50%–100% across models). Here we show that Southern Ocean surface warming and freshening explain this missing fraction. Enhanced dense‐to‐light water mass transformation in the Southern Ocean produces upper‐ocean volume convergence that propagates globally via wave dynamics, slowing the ITF in a manner analogous to the AMOC‐driven impacts. We further quantified the combined AMOC and Southern Ocean contributions and find that these bipolar processes explain, on average, 89% of the projected ITF decline in climate models. Our results reveal critical linkages between high‐latitude climate change and low‐latitude circulation, positioning the ITF as an indicator of global overturning adjustments."

We examine the melting behavior of dry granitoid fault rocks ball‐milled to mean grain sizes from 150 μm to 300 nm. Differential scanning calorimetry reveals a decrease in melting temperature, from 1,270°C to 1,090°C, with decreasing grain size. Our results demonstrate that extreme grain‐size reduction lowers the temperatures required for dynamic weakening via melting.

In particular, future decreases in glacier runoff are hypothesized to reduce the stability of hydro‐biogeochemical export. We test this hypothesis using a decade of discharge, dissolved organic carbon, total dissolved nitrogen and soluble reactive phosphorus data from four Alaskan watersheds spanning a gradient in glacier cover. We demonstrate that glacier decline leads to lower and more variable runoff across years, with 2.6–4.3 times greater interannual variability in lightly‐glacierized compared to glacier‐dominated watersheds. Biogeochemical export also became more stochastic with retreat, with up to a five‐fold increase in interannual variability. However, the responses of riverine concentrations and yields to changes in glacier cover varied widely between constituents. Such shifts in the magnitude and stochasticity of hydro‐biogeochemical yields have important implications for the ecological stability of downstream ecosystems."

Ocean‐bottom seismometers (OBS) deployed on the Congo Canyon–Channel levees captured the structure and turbulence of overspill during an exceptionally large canyon‐flushing event in 2020. Overspill persisted for 3 weeks and comprised numerous short (20‐min to 2‐hr) pulses focused at outer bends. Spectra during overspill show well‐resolved turbulence inertial subranges, yielding event‐average dissipation rates of 10−6–10−5 m2 s−3, comparable to energetic internal‐tide breaking. Abyssal overspill can therefore be long‐lasting and highly pulsed, providing an episodic but locally important source of deep‐ocean mixing. This new view of levee overspill has important implications for building levees and the interpretation of ancient turbidites. Individual levee deposits may be formed incrementally by many pulses of dilute and fine‐grained flow from a single turbidity current."

Although deep learning methods show promise, most models lack physical constraints, limiting their consistency with atmospheric processes. We introduce FURECast, a deep learning model that not only leverages three‐dimensional structure of polarimetric radar variables (ZH, ZDR, KDP) but also embeds their intrinsic self‐consistency relation as a physical constraint. The model employs an encoder‐translator‐decoder architecture, integrating multi‐level inputs via late fusion and evolving features through cascaded multiscale blocks. Moreover, a novel physical loss term is introduced to enforce microphysical consistency during training. Evaluated on S‐band (GD‐SPOL) and C‐band (NJU‐CPOL) radar data sets, FURECast achieves a 14.1% improvement in 90‐min critical success index (35 dBZ threshold) over the 2D reflectivity‐only baseline, while reducing physical inconsistency by two orders of magnitude. These results underscore the value of 3D polarimetric structure and physics‐guided learning in advancing convective precipitation nowcasting."

The fault is thought to be segmented with sections rupturing both individually and in combination. Surface mapping indicates the fault changes from near‐vertically orientated in the South‐Westland Section, to dipping ∼45–60° SE in the Central Section, but it is unclear how this change is accommodated in the subsurface. We use receiver functions generated from long‐term seismic stations and a temporary array to image the subsurface at this section boundary. Using velocity inversion and common conversion point stacking, we find there are distinct crustal structures on either side of the fault trace. The subvertical fault likely extends northeastward past the section boundary and two fault structures may co‐exist beyond the section boundary. This geometry is consistent with microseismicity and previous tectonic studies, and helps to explain through‐going fault ruptures."

This study develops a multi‐metric (spatial extent, magnitude, and efficiency) framework to evaluate the spatiotemporal patterns of Lake Cooling Capacity (LCC) for 265 major Chinese lakes from 1980 to 2022. Results show that Chinese lakes exert substantial cooling on summer daytime maximum temperatures, with a mean extent of 27.5 km, a magnitude of 1.03°C, and an efficiency of 0.46°C/10 km. LCC efficiency shows spatially asymmetric trends, intensifying on the Tibetan Plateau but weakening in the eastern plains. Random forests analysis reveals that albedo is the dominant driver of temporal variability, while depth and surrounding topography are the primary spatial controls. These findings underscore the critical role of lakes in mitigating regional heat extremes and highlight the necessity of incorporating lake‐climate feedback into climate adaptation."

We show that conventional elastic dislocation models yield slip rates and locking depths that conflict with seismic and geologic constraints. In contrast, models incorporating a viscoelastic rheology for the lower crust yield geologically consistent slip rates, with the Zemuhe fault slipping 7 mm/yr and the Daliangshan fault slipping 2 mm/yr, and locking depths more consistent with microseismicity (17–20 km). In contrast with major strike‐slip faults worldwide, deformation in this immature system appears distributed over a broad lower‐crustal region.

Here, we estimated baseline average Tmicromax (1984–2014), measured 15 cm above the surface and projected changes by 2050 under different scenarios combining climate forcing and forest cover change. Baseline Tmicromax ranged from 11.6°C to 25.1°C, driven mainly by topography, macroclimate, and vegetation structure.

Results indicate that for 1‐hr interval (typical sampling interval of mooring observations), both the coherent and incoherent characteristics of semidiurnal ITs exhibit convergence with increasing duration. However, for 238‐hr interval (approximate repeating cycle of TOPEX/Poseidon/Jason‐1/Jason‐2 satellites), the coherent characteristic of semidiurnal ITs has a larger bias than that for 1‐hr interval, and this bias does not monotonously decrease with duration; the semidiurnal IT incoherence has a larger uncertainty than that for 1‐hr interval."

These platforms measured key atmospheric and oceanic parameters, including wind speed, temperature, and humidity, to quantify air‐sea fluxes and characterize the atmospheric boundary layer and upper ocean. This study is the first to leverage these observations to evaluate the background ensemble at the air‐sea interface from a self‐cycled Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System data assimilation (DA) system. Verification against observations demonstrated that the background deterministic forecast captures key spatial and temporal variability of surface air temperature (SAT), humidity, wind speed, and sea surface temperature (SST), although systematic biases in humidity and SST were identified due to a combination of model and initialization errors. Evaluation of the 6‐hr background ensemble showed skillful spread for SAT, humidity, and wind speed relative to the forecast error variance. In contrast, the SST ensemble spread was markedly underestimated and inversely related to forecast error variance, emphasizing the need for sampling the oceanic state uncertainty. For longer background forecasts, temporal cross‐correlation of SST with SAT and surface wind speed revealed physically coherent time‐lagged relationships, with atmospheric changes preceding SST responses by approximately 24–36 hr. Similar correlations were preserved in ensemble perturbations, reflecting the ability of the background ensemble in maintaining the dynamic consistency across the coupled interface. These findings provide insights into improving the coupled background ensemble covariances, paving the way for the development of strongly coupled ocean‐atmosphere DA for hurricane forecasting."

Midlatitude tropopause‐overshooting convection is especially important to climate because it can enhance stratospheric water vapor, which has its greatest radiative forcing sensitivity in the extratropical lower stratosphere. Thus, it is essential to understand what factors influence the strength and prevalence of overshooting storms and associated STE. The U.S. Dynamics and Chemistry of the Summer Stratosphere (DCOTSS) field campaign during 2021 and 2022 was the first large‐scale airborne primarily focused on sampling stratospheric impacts from overshooting convection. Our research utilizes the extensive DCOTSS data set in combination with radar, satellite, and environmental observations to investigate relationships between observed stratosphere composition change and storm and environmental characteristics. Our results demonstrate greater magnitudes of STE for above‐anvil cirrus plume (AACP)‐producing storms and mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). In addition, the most extreme enhancements in water vapor and other tropospheric gases occur where the tropopause height is low and the depth of overshooting is high, especially for AACP‐producing storms. We also investigate the impact of storm and environmental characteristics on pathways for hydration (air mass transport and mixing vs. ice sublimation), finding that they also modulate the frequencies of each process at different altitudes. Namely, mixing is found to be most prevalent in AACP‐producing storms and MCSs, which can help explain transport differences between water vapor and other gases."

While their horizontal size distribution (HSD) generally follows a power‐law, it consistently displays a distinct scale break. Such an HSD pattern of cumulus clouds has been extensively reported, but the underlying mechanism is so far unclear. This study explores it by analyzing cumulus cloud samples generated by the large eddy simulations. By taking into account the evolution processes of individual clouds as well as their precursor bubbles, that is, a compact entity of updrafts originating from the surface layer, we identified a critical linkage between cloud lifecycle and the emergence of scale break. For the two categories of cumulus clouds (active and forced) that are divided into two life stages (growing and decaying), the scale break was found to appear only in decaying active ones. The HSD of decaying forced clouds and that of growing ones exactly satisfy a power‐law, consistent with their precursor bubbles. The initial HSD of young bubbles undergoes modification through the temporal size evolution of clouds near their maximum horizontal cross‐sectional area layer (maximum area layer), thus shaping the HSD of cumulus clouds. During the decaying stage, active clouds experiences non‐monotonic variation of the averaged vertical velocity, slowing their size down as they traverse the level of neutral buoyancy. The medium‐size snapshot cloud samples increasing in this way causes a scale break in the statistics, suggesting that the scale break is essentially an emergent property of cumulus cloud dynamics."

A Spatiotemporal Analysis of China's 89 Shrinking Cities (2001–2019),"Numerous studies have examined how urban expansion exacerbates Surface Urban Heat Island intensity (SUHII), yet limited attention has been paid to whether and how urban shrinkage mitigates SUHII. This study employed multiple models to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution of surface urban heat island (SUHI) and its driving factors in 89 shrinking cities in China from 2001 to 2019 across interannual, seasonal, and diurnal scales. The results show that (a) From 2001 to 2019, the average SUHII of shrinking cities in China experienced a slight overall decrease, falling by 0.150 K during the daytime and 0.128 K at nighttime. However, at the individual city level, the dominant change types were non‐significant decrease and non‐significant increase. (b) During the daytime and nighttime, 66.292% and 57.303% of shrinking cities, respectively, exhibited declining SUHII trends, with pronounced differences across climate zones. Shrinking cities located in the North Subtropical climate zone showed the most significant magnitude of SUHII reduction. (c) The driving mechanisms of SUHII in shrinking cities revealed pronounced diurnal asymmetry and climate zone dependence. Daytime SUHII was primarily driven by meteorological factors such as relative humidity, sunshine duration, and surface pressure, whereas nighttime SUHII reflected the combined effects of both meteorological and anthropogenic factors. Moreover, the cooling effect associated with population loss partially offset the enhancement of SUHII caused by urban expansion. This study provides new empirical evidence for understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics and driving mechanisms of SUHI in shrinking cities."

 The giant impact hypothesis, generally considered as the origin of the Moon, predicts a dry Moon lacking volatile elements, but in situ observations provide evidence that volatile elements such as carbon, nitrogen and oxygen are stored on the lunar surface and are being supplied to its exosphere. Such volatile sources and dynamics remain poorly understood. Here we investigate the chemical composition and time variations in the lunar exosphere using an ion mass analyser onboard the Kaguya satellite. We reported sporadic changes in the C+/O+ ratio occurring immediately after meteoroid showers. We also observed daily variations in the C+/O+ and N+/O+ ion ratios, suggesting two possible sources: a nitrogen-rich reservoir with a higher N/C ratio than the solar value or N-free CO/CO2 gases. Our findings indicate that the mechanism for the production of C+, N+ and O+ ions during the daytime is solar wind sputtering—ejection through collision with solar wind particles—of the nitrogen-rich reservoir, whereas micrometeoroid impacts and photoionization are not dominant processes. We propose that the nitrogen-rich regolith reported in Apollo samples and indigenous volcanic gases constitute the source of volatile ions in a thin lunar atmosphere.

A Rh-Cu dual-atom catalyst separates tasks so oxygen is restrained, boosting methanol selectivity to 81% and tripling activity. 
 Direct oxidation of methane to methanol is valuable, but reactive oxygen species over oxidize methane and lower selectivity. Here we report a Rh-Cu heteronuclear dual atom catalyst on nitrogen doped graphite that separates sites and restrains oxygen intermediates, enabling methanol through oxygen insertion into C-H bonds. An encapsulated pyrolysis strategy yields an Rh-Cu-N6 motif with a Rh-Cu distance of 2.42 Å. Electronic coupling between Rh and Cu induces charge polarization and improves reactant activation. Cu captures active oxygen species, suppressing excessive oxygen insertion and deep oxidation. The catalyst achieves up to 81% methanol selectivity and about threefold higher activity than a single atom Rh catalyst. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal stable oxygen bridged intermediates, Rh-O-O-Cu and Rh-O-Cu. Rh stabilizes methyl intermediates, while Cu restrains nearby oxygen reactivity and directs oxygen insertion into C-H bonds to form methanol.

Tracking cargo flows uncovers annual cycles with 16% swings-insights that could optimize costs and emissions. 
 The global oil tanker shipping network emerges from individual ship and fleet decisions driven by economic, environmental, and operational factors. However, most existing shipping network analysis rely on static, time-aggregated representations, overlooking critical temporality connecting individual vessel routing strategies with both operational efficiency and global cargo flows. To address this gap, we introduce a dual-scale framework complementing sequential motif analysis—capturing recurrent patterns in vessel movement sequences—with Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), extracting temporal dynamics from vessel trajectories to global cargo flows. Using tanker movement data across four vessel classes, we demonstrate that vessels exhibiting diverse regional exploration patterns spend up to 50% more time transporting rather than seeking cargo, indicating greater economic and environmental efficiency. At the system scale, DMD analysis reveals distinct seasonality with an average peak-to-trough amplitude of 16%. Major import regions show synchronous annual demand cycles, while export regions exhibit anti-synchronicity. These temporal patterns, invisible to static analysis, reveal performance differences that enable route optimization for both economic and environmental benefits.

 To unlock the potential of high-resolution nighttime light (NTL) data, robust compositing methods are required. We present an automatic and scalable method for high-resolution NTL data compositing, demonstrated using SDGSAT-1 data. It operates at the pixel level by ranking structural image features across a temporal stack and selecting the observation acquired under the most favourable conditions. Unlike workflows that rely on external cloud masks and physical atmospheric correction models, it uses only internal image characteristics and stationarity metrics to mitigate contamination from clouds, haze, moonlight reflection, and sensor artefacts. The resulting composites show strong agreement with established, annual VIIRS products used as independent external benchmarks (correlation up to 0.95, R2 consistently >0.80), while retaining a spatially crisper signal than VIIRS at a common aggregated scale (e.g. 800 m). The method also improves SDGSAT-1 usability by suppressing acquisition-dependent artefacts, including scene anomalies and inter-band RGB misregistration, and by improving spatial alignment: mean positional error is reduced from >340 m in the input data to 19.2 m in the composite. Internal geometric consistency improves markedly, with mean inter-band RGB misregistration decreasing from 47.6 m to 3.6 m. The workflow also introduces a taxonomy combining NTL brightness, temporal stationarity, and built-up area presence. For the Po Plain (Italy), the stationary NTL domain covers ∼10% of the area yet contains ∼60% of total light emissions; within it, 73.6% originate from built-up areas and 26.4% from non-built-up infrastructure (e.g. lit roads). Overall, the method supports integration of SDGSAT-1 data into global monitoring frameworks."

 Gas flaring (GF), a significant source of greenhouse gases, poses a challenge to satellite monitoring due to the trade-off between the low spatial resolution of nighttime observations and the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of daytime data. This limitation results in notable omissions in global flare inventories, particularly for small-scale, intermittent, or clustered offshore flares. To address this, we introduce a Day-Night Synergistic Gas Flaring Detection (DNSGFD) framework, leveraging the synchronous, multi-sensor capabilities of the Sustainable Development Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1). The framework's core strategy, “nighttime discovery and daytime confirmation,” is uniquely enabled by our proposed Glimmer-enhanced Flare Disturbance Index (GFDI), which fuses thermal, glimmer, and chromatic information from a single nighttime pass to pinpoint high-confidence candidates. Applied to the Southeast Asian Seas, our framework identified 317 offshore gas flaring platforms (GFPs) with an overall accuracy of 96.6%. Cross-validation against benchmark datasets underscores its superior performance: DNSGFD successfully identified 96.9% of the platforms listed in the DAFI v2 inventory, detected 169 GFPs unresolved by the VIIRS Nightfire product, and cataloged 193 previously unrecorded sites. By systematically integrating the high SNR of nighttime sensing with the fine spatial detail of daytime imaging, our methodology establishes a more complete, accurate, and physically robust foundation for global flare inventories."

 New satellites are needed to quantify the upwards of 170 trillion microplastic particles floating on the ocean surface that concentrate in the convergence zones of the ocean gyres. Past research on cleaned microplastic pieces harvested from the ocean gyres indicates a highly consistent endmember across the spectrum with distinct absorption features at 931, 1215, 1417, 1732 and 2313 nm. Here, surface-floating microplastic pieces with natural biofilm were collected at 21 stations across 4700 km of the North Pacific gyre convergence zone, also referred to as the “Great Pacific Garbage Patch,” to assess the impact of biofilm on spectral properties. Reflectance of damp, biofilmed microplastic pieces were measured in bulk from 350 to 2500 nm shortly after collection with ambient sunlight on the ship deck and the biofilm was separated and stored for DNA sequencing. Biofilm was found on all collected samples and the red algal genus Tsunamia alone accounted for ∼53% of the eukaryotic microbiome of the harvested biofilm. Biofilm absorbed light broadly across blue wavelengths (400–500 nm) and in a narrowband at 674 nm consistent with chlorophyll-a and other photosynthetic pigments in red algae. Hence, biofilm could impact ocean color chlorophyll-a and fluorescence line height retrievals if particle concentrations were high enough. No significant differences were found in band-depths estimated at 1215 and 1732 nm and only minor differences at 931 nm between biofilmed and biofilm-removed samples. This new endmember of damp, biofilmed microplastic most closely resembles the spectral properties of microplastic pieces as they naturally occur in the ocean gyres. New sensors for marine debris detection may consider narrow bands between 670 and 680 nm to discriminate red algal biofilmed microplastic from phytoplankton, in addition to the NIR and SWIR bands characteristic of floating marine microplastics."

 We introduce a fully automated and scalable method for mapping surface water extents from single-acquisition Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. This approach integrates adaptive thresholding of radiometric terrain-corrected SAR backscatter data, fuzzy-logic classification, region growing, dark land estimation, and a bimodality test to minimize false positives in low-backscattering areas and false negatives in high-backscattering areas. By combining these steps, the algorithm achieves classification accuracies exceeding 85% in detecting surface water extents across diverse environmental conditions.Accuracy was first assessed at meter scale using 52 PlanetScope scenes acquired worldwide in September–October 2019; the algorithm achieved 93% overall accuracy, 86% user's accuracy, and 94% producer's accuracy. Global robustness was then evaluated by processing every Sentinel-1 acquisition from 1 to 12 November 2023 and cross-comparing the resulting maps with 6561 temporally matched observational products for end-users from remote sensing analysis (OPERA) dynamic surface water extent from Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (DSWx-HLS) products. This large-scale test yielded 90% user's and 94% producer's accuracies, confirming reliable performance at continental extent.Additional case studies demonstrate the algorithm's ability to handle surface water extent in sand-dominated deserts, to track seasonal amplitude in Folsom Lake (California), drought-induced loss in Cerro Prieto Reservoir (Mexico), and rapid filling of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. These results show that the method scales across local to global domains and maintains high accuracy, providing a practical tool for near-real-time monitoring of floods, droughts, and water-resource management. Because the approach is sensor-agnostic, it can be ported to forthcoming L- and S-band missions such as NASA-ISRO synthetic aperture radar (NISAR), broadening its applicability to future hydrologic observations."

 Rapid climate warming is increasing thaw hazards in permafrost regions, threatening infrastructure and ecosystems, but accurate assessment of the susceptibility to thaw hazards in data-scarce high-altitude zones such as the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau remains challenging. Reported here is the development of an inventory of 534 thaw-hazard sites in Qinghai Province using an integrated framework of multi-source data (satellite remote sensing, unmanned aerial vehicle imagery, field surveys). Four machine learning models—random forest, support vector machine, multilayer perceptron, and the novel tabular prior-data fitted network (TabPFN)—are compared for thaw-hazard susceptibility mapping under small-sample constraints, evaluating accuracy, interpretability, and uncertainty. TabPFN significantly outperforms the conventional models, achieving an accuracy of 0.938, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.979, and the lowest coefficient of variation, indicating robust predictions with limited data. Unlike conventional models favoring precipitation and permafrost type, Shapley additive explanations analysis shows that TabPFN prioritizes vegetation and temperature change rate. The four susceptibility maps consistently align predicted high-risk zones with observed thaw hazards, particularly in areas near the Qinghai–Tibet Railway. Uncertainty mapping highlights sparse-data areas for targeted field validation. This study demonstrates TabPFN's value as a robust, interpretable tool for thaw-hazard modeling in data-scarce permafrost regions, aiding risk mitigation and land-use planning."

 Accurately segmenting planar primitives from airborne LiDAR point clouds is crucial for urban planning applications and three-dimensional (3D) building reconstruction. However, existing approaches often exhibit limited extensibility and diminished robustness when segmenting buildings with diverse architectural styles. To address this issue, this paper proposes an enhanced constrained k-Plane Clustering (kPC) method that segments building point clouds into distinct planar primitives. The kPC algorithm formulates the segmentation task as a mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem incorporating three geometric constraints: point-to-plane distance minimization, cluster-center proximity enforcement, and directional regularization. This problem is solved via an alternating minimization strategy, which iteratively updates cluster assignments and plane parameters using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) until convergence is reached. The proposed constrained kPC method provides two key advantages. First, it effectively mitigates the infinite extensibility of fitted planes. This issue is common in conventional kPC methods, and its mitigation directly addresses a major source of suboptimal segmentation performance. Second, the framework demonstrates robustness to variations in the optimization objective’s coefficients while maintaining consistent performance. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world multi-style building datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior segmentation accuracy and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed method is robust to variations in its parameters, maintaining effectiveness across a wide range of values."

 Soil moisture (SM) is a key variable governing land–atmosphere interactions and terrestrial hydrological processes. Recent satellite missions provide global SM observations, among which ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 offers full polarimetric L-band SAR measurements at spatial resolutions as fine as 6 m. Retrieving SM from SAR data requires disentangling scattering contributions from vegetation and surface roughness (e.g., root mean square height; Hrms). Conventional approaches typically rely on collocated in-situ measurements of SM and Hrms for calibration, but such data are often sparse. In addition, the simultaneous estimation of multiple scattering parameters from limited SAR observables can lead to ill-posed inversion and unstable retrievals. To address these challenges, we propose ESCAPE (Ensemble-based Self-Calibrated Autoencoder with Physics-informed Estimation), a self-calibrating framework that integrates polarimetric ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 observations within a 10-member physics-informed neural network (PINN) ensemble. ESCAPE embeds physically based scattering models into an autoencoder architecture and estimates SM and Hrms without using in-situ SM measurements as direct training targets. The ensemble strategy mitigates uncertainty arising from ill-posed physical constraints and gradient-based optimization. Spatial evaluation over Spain and Austria demonstrates robust performance, with a correlation coefficient R = 0.701, an unbiased root mean squared difference (ubRMSD) of 0.089 m3 m−3, and a bias of 0.006 m3 m−3. Temporal evaluation at an independent site in Japan yields R = 0.568, ubRMSD of 0.06 m3 m−3, and a bias of − 0.13 m3 m−3. Ensemble analysis further reveals that aggregating multiple PINN realizations improves robustness by reducing the influence of poorly converged members. Compared with conventional approaches trained directly on in-situ data, ESCAPE exhibits improved generalization across heterogeneous environments. These results highlight the potential of ESCAPE as a self-calibrated, satellite-only framework for high-resolution estimation of geophysical parameters, demonstrating the value of combining physical principles with ensemble-based deep learning for SAR remote sensing applications."

 This study employs machine learning methods to predict O3, SO2, and PM2.5 concentrations at four typical sites in the Yunnan Plateau region (Diqing, Dali, Pu'er, and Banna) and examines the underlying driving mechanisms. By utilizing four models—RF, BP, CNN, and LSTM—and combining meteorological factors, emission data, and terrain characteristics, the prediction results indicate that all models exhibit high accuracy with narrow performance gaps. Although RF demonstrates slightly superior overall stability, the structurally simpler BP model performs comparably to deep learning models in specific scenarios, indicating that complex architectures are not always strictly superior. O3 prediction performance is optimal (R2 > 0.88) due to its strong photochemical reaction regularity; SO2 follows (R2 = 0.79–0.97), influenced by the stability of emission sources; PM2.5 has the poorest fit (R2 = 0.56–0.86), attributed to its multi-source nonlinear characteristics and the complexity of transboundary transport.

 In recent years, surface ozone (O3) pollution has become increasingly severe in East China, especially in Shanghai, highlighting the need for accurate models to forecast O3 concentrations and to investigate its formation mechanism. This study develops an O3 forecasting model using a stacking ensemble machine learning (Stacking EML) method based on meteorological and air pollutant data from 2021 to 2024. Subsequently, Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis is employed to quantify the influences of meteorological and chemical factors on O3 formation during a typical O3 pollution episode in Shanghai. The integration of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) significantly enhances the model performance, with the R2 value increasing from 0.74 to 0.81. SHAP analysis reveals that chemical factors dominate O3 formation on polluted days (60%), higher than meteorological factors (40%). Total VOCs (TVOCs) are the primary chemical driver (42%), and oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) constitute 27.1%, with reactive aldehydes being the dominant species. O3 formation sensitivity curves from 2021 to 2024 further indicate that Shanghai is in a VOC-limited regime, with a tendency toward a weakly VOC-limited condition. The combination of Stacking EML and SHAP analysis proves to be a powerful tool for predicting and interpreting O3 formation, thereby providing a scientific basis for formulating coordinated NOx and VOCs emission reduction strategies."

 Quantifying seasonal variations in ozone (O3) fluxes in forest ecosystems and identifying their causes are essential for characterizing the global sink and source strength of O3 and conserving atmospheric and forest environments. We measured O3 fluxes in a Japanese red pine (Pinus densiflora) forest located at the foothills of Mt. Fuji from 2016 to 2020 using the micrometeorological gradient method. Flux quality was validated by comparing CO2 fluxes derived from the gradient and eddy-covariance methods, which showed good agreement. To our knowledge, this study represents the first multiyear observations of O3 fluxes and stomatal O3 uptake ratios in an Asian forest. The measured five-year daytime O3 fluxes (10:00–15:00) in summer and winter were −9.6 ± 3.2 and −3.3 ± 1.8 nmol m−2 s−1, respectively. The O3 flux in winter was approximately 30% of that in summer. The daytime O3 concentration and flux (deposition) values peaked in spring and summer. The ratios of the stomatal O3 uptake to the total forest O3 deposition in summer and winter were 0.64 ± 0.28 and 0.32 ± 0.30, respectively. This ratio was among the highest reported in previous studies. A likely explanation is the relatively low ambient O3 concentration at the observation site. The cumulative value of leaf area-based stomatal O3 fluxes exceeding 1.6 and 1 nmol m−2 s−1 during summer was 0.7 and 1.9 mmol m−2, respectively. The Japanese red pine forests absorb a certain amount of O3, which has the potential to impact the ecosystem. Further studies are needed to quantify ecological impacts and underlying deposition processes."

 This study presents a comprehensive analysis of extreme precipitation events (EPs) across France over the period 1950-2023, using a rigorously quality-controlled dataset of 352 rain gauges that met strict completeness criteria (≥ 99% temporal coverage). Comparison with ERA5 reanalysis data showed systematic overestimation of rainy days (by 10-30 days) and underestimation of peak precipitation in mountainous regions, highlighting the superiority of ground observations for the subsequent analysis and trend detection. We characterized spatial and temporal variability of EPs using multiple indices including annual maximum 1-day precipitation (RX1), 99th percentile threshold (P99th), mean exceedance above the 99th percentile (ME99th), and frequency of extreme rainy days (RP99th), following the definitions set by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI), with particular focus on the Massif Central and Cévennes regions as critical hydrological hotspots. Quality control showed that 95% of stations had no significant outliers, and 86% demonstrated homogenous precipitation data. A statistically significant increasing trend in RX1 was observed (0.5 mm decade-1, P < 0.05), while P99th exhibited no significant trend. RP99th revealed a significant decreasing trend (-1.6 days decade-1, P < 0.05), whereas ME99th showed a significant increase (∼0.26 mm decade-1, P < 0.1). Seasonally, RX1, P99th and ME99th peaked in autumn, while RP99th increased from May through December. Spatially, stations located in the Cévennes and Massif Central recorded the highest values of RX1, P99th, and ME99th, with a noticeable intensification in their trends. The years 1982 and 2003 showed peak anomalies in RX1 and ME99th. Investigation of large-scale atmospheric drivers revealed that six climate indices (El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Arctic Oscillation (AO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), East Atlantic Oscillation (EAO), Scandinavian pattern (SCA), East Atlantic–Western Russia (EAWR)) with semiannual and annual cycles of precipitation collectively explain up to 33% of precipitation variability, though their influence was weaker for extreme indices. Nonetheless, correlations between global climate indices and precipitation were statistically significant (P < 0.05), exceeding 0.4 at several stations. Notably, the AO and SCA had distinct negative (r = -0.26) and positive (r = 0.29) effects, respectively. Thirteen widespread extreme precipitation events (P99th) were identified, each affecting at least 15% of stations. Among them, only the event in December 2003 was classified as severely abnormal based on Gumbel return period analysis; others were within the historical range of variability. Synoptic analysis indicated that these events were often driven by low-pressure systems over the North Atlantic, with cyclonic circulation and enhanced westerlies channeling moisture via atmospheric rivers into the region."

 Climate change and anthropogenic activities are intensifying drought-flood abrupt alternation (DFAA) events in the Poyang Lake Basin (PLB), threatening water security and ecological resilience. Using the Multi-scale Standardized DFAA Index (MSDFAI), we identify DFAA events from 1962 to 2022 and integrate Mann-Kendall trend tests, continuous wavelet transform, XGBoost-SHAP interpretable machine learning, Generalized Additive Models, and teleconnection analysis to unravel spatiotemporal dynamics and nonlinear drivers. Results show that drought-to-flood (DTF) events have shifted from weakening to strengthening, while flood-to-drought (FTD) events rose then declined; both exhibit persistent hotspots in northern and central-eastern PLB. FTD dominates 6–32-year cycles, whereas DTF is confined to 6–24 years. Soil moisture and precipitation are primary climatic drivers, with topography modulating hydrological responses. Impervious surface area and cropland proportion exhibit multi-threshold effects, with DFAA risk surging beyond critical urbanization levels. MSDFAI correlates negatively with ENSO indices (SOI, NINO3.4) and positively with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), confirming their role as dominant teleconnection controls. This study establishes an integrated analytical framework that combines DFAA detection, extreme sequence analysis, and interpretable machine learning to uncover nonlinear response patterns and threshold-dependent mechanisms underlying drought–flood abrupt alternation dynamics in the PLB. This approach advances mechanistic understanding of compound hydroclimatic extremes in monsoon regions and provides a robust basis for adaptive management."

 East Asian summer rainfall (EASR) exhibits substantial spatial and temporal diversity. One of its prominent and impactful forms is monsoon–tropical cyclone landfall (MS-LTC) rainfall, which occurs when the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) coincides with landfalling tropical cyclones (TCs) and typically leads to extreme rainfall and flooding over China. However, the physical mechanisms governing MS-LTC rainfall and its seasonal predictability remain poorly understood. Observations from 1983 to 2023 show that the leading mode of MS-LTC rainfall is dominated by interannual variability, featuring two anomaly centers located over the Western North Pacific (WNP) and North China, and associated with a meridional dipole circulation over East Asia (EA), comprising a low-latitude cyclone and a mid-latitude anticyclone. Two independent and physically meaningful precursors have been identified: Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) anomalies over the Greenland and Barents Seas, and cold sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) in the far eastern equatorial Pacific (Niño1 + 2 region). The Arctic SIC anomalies can persist from the preceding winter through summer, primarily maintained by the sea ice–albedo feedback and the ocean memory effect over the Greenland and Barents Seas, respectively. Both observations and numerical experiments demonstrate that these anomalies excite a downstream Rossby wave train, facilitating the development of the meridional dipole pattern over EA. Concurrently, La Niña–like SST cooling induces a baroclinic response over EA that exhibits a circulation structure opposite to the Pacific–East Asia (PEA) teleconnection, thereby sustaining the dipole pattern. A physics-based empirical prediction (P-E) model that combines MAM SIC and JFM Niño1 + 2 indices achieves the highest skill in predicting MS-LTC PC1 during the hindcast period. This P-E model provides a physically grounded and operationally feasible tool for the seasonal prediction of MS-LTC rainfall."

 The Northeast China Cold Vortex (NCCV) significantly affects regional weather, but its three-dimensional (3D) seasonal structural differences have not been systematically quantified. Using ERA5 reanalysis data (2000−2020), we quantify these contrasts through statistics and dynamical compositing. The results show that: (1) The summer NCCV has a smaller horizontal scale (365 km), approximately 26.4% smaller than the winter mean (496 km). In contrast, its vertical scale is larger (8 km), about 60% greater than in winter (5 km). (2) Thermodynamically, intense summer diabatic heating (primarily latent heat release) generates potential vorticity (PV) anomalies near the vortex core, while the peripheral PV anomalies rapidly dissipate. This enhances convergence and vertical PV transport and leads to a “compact and deep” structure. In contrast, weaker diabatic heating and vertical PV transport in winter result in a “broad and shallow” structure. (3) Dynamically, the vortex core exhibits stronger inertial stability in summer, favoring upward transport of PV. In winter, a broader region of inertial stability inhibits convergence and limits vertical development of the vortex system. This combined thermodynamic-dynamic perspective improves the understanding and prediction of NCCV-related extreme weather."

 During 2020–2022, typhoon activity over the Northwest Pacific was associated with basin-wide tropical climate anomalies linked to the triple La Niña, with genesis regions shifting northwestward and intensities being generally weaker. This study, based on best-track typhoon data and the ERA5 (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5th Generation) data, investigates the main characteristics of summer typhoon activity in China during 2020–2022 and their underlying physical processes. The key findings are as follows: During the La Niña period, the Pacific SSTA (Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly)exhibited an east-cold, west-warm pattern, leading to an expanded Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) with its ridge shifting northward and its western boundary extending westward, guiding typhoon paths northwestward. The ascending branch of the Walker circulation shifted westward and intensified, elevating the latitude of typhoon genesis. Meanwhile, the cooling in the tropical North Atlantic and the positive phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) enhanced water vapor convergence through Kelvin and Rossby waves, contributing to anomalies in the WPSH. The combined effects of the WPSH, Walker circulation, and other climate modes during the triple La Niña altered the environmental fields for typhoons (with increased relative humidity and vertical velocity). As a result, typhoon genesis locations shifted northwestward, and the centroid of typhoon tracks moved closer to the Chinese coast."

 Previous studies have revealed distinct regional variations of the Hadley cell and zonal asymmetric features in Antarctic Oscillation (AAO), the dominant atmospheric mode of the extratropical Southern Hemisphere. However, the interannual connection between them and the impacts of AAO on the local Hadley circulation edges in both hemispheres still remain unclear. Based on ERA5 reanalysis during 1979–2020, this study demonstrates that the AAO exhibits a zonal asymmetric spatial structure that aligns with the distribution of tropical velocity potential anomalies, and divides the Hadley circulation into Indo-Pacific, East Pacific, and Atlantic-Africa sectors, with the Indo-Pacific sector displaying the strongest edge variability. AAO is out-phase with the variations of the southern hemispheric Hadley circulation edge (SHE) of the Indo-Pacific sector in March–April-May, September–October-November (SON), and December–January-February (DJF), and out-phase with the variations of East Pacific sector's SHE in June–July-August. AAO is in-phase with the variations of the northern hemispheric Hadley circulation edge (NHE) of the Atlantic-Africa sector in DJF. Above processes are reproduced by the linear baroclinic model. AAO primarily influences the SHE via the transient eddies, while its impact on the NHE is jointly modulated by both transient and stationary eddies. Finally, we reveal the AAO's influence on precipitation anomalies via the Hadley circulation: AAO is in-phase with precipitation over Australia in SON, but in DJF a positive AAO forces a dipole pattern of decreased precipitation in southern Europe and Mediterranean and increased precipitation in northern Europe. This study deepens the pivotal role of AAO in regional Hadley circulation dynamics."

 This study analyzes 53 storms that occurred in the summer of 2015, using data from the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Lightning Location System (GLLS) and an S-band Doppler radar observation. Among these storms, 34 produced large-peak-current cloud-to-ground (LCG) lightning, 10 produced only small-peak-current CG (SCG) lightning, and 9 produced no detectable CG lightning. The results show that the combination of 40 dBZ echo top height (Top40) and 40 dBZ echo area at 5 km altitude (Area40_5) effectively distinguishes LCG-dominant storms from non-LCG storms.The analysis reveals that updraft intensity fundamentally controls LCG production. Storms exhibiting maximum Top40 ≥ 12 km show evidently higher peak LCG frequencies and greater total LCG counts compared to storms with weaker updrafts. Notably, even storms with maximum Top40 < 12 km can achieve substantial LCG production when these moderately intense updrafts exhibit prolonged duration.A robust correlation emerges between the maximum Top40 values recorded during the 30-min period preceding LCG initiation and subsequent LCG counts in the initial active phase. Throughout storm lifetimes, Top40 variations mirror LCG frequency trends, with Top40 and Area40_5 values during LCG-active periods consistently exceeding those during SCG-only periods. Primary LCG activity predominantly occurs during Area40_5's growth phase prior to peak development, followed by rapid weakening or diminishment after the peak.These findings confirm that LCGs result from active updrafts, which may provide both favorable conditions for vigorous electrification and formation of high-density charge structures. Consequently, frequent LCG activity serves as an indicator of active updraft periods in storms.It should be noted that the thunderstorm cases analyzed in this study were all from a single summer season. Although the fundamental trends and relationships identified are expected to be robust, some specific quantitative values may vary interannually. Furthermore, the analysis primarily focused on localized, small-scale thunderstorms, which represent the most common type during the local summer. Consequently, the conclusions drawn here may not be fully applicable to larger-scale convective systems and should be interpreted with caution in such contexts."

We present an IL-induced self-assembly strategy enabling the rapid formation of ultrathin polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) ionogel films. Upon contact with ILs, PVA chains spontaneously organize into a robust, noncovalently cross-linked network, achieving ultrafast conversion (<5 s) of viscous precursors into films with tunable thickness (13 to 103 μm). The resulting ionogel films combine high tensile strength (9.69 MPa), toughness (35.93 MJ m−3), good ionic conductivity (0.2 S m−1), and excellent environmental stability.

Here, we present the first general protocol to experiment on magnetic hysteresis on programmable quantum annealers and implement it on three D-Wave superconducting qubit quantum annealers, using up to thousands of spins, for both ferromagnetic and disordered Ising models, and across different graph topologies. We observe hysteresis loops whose area depends nonmonotonically on quantum fluctuations, exhibiting both expected and unexpected features, such as disorder-induced steps and nonmonotonicities. Our work establishes quantum annealers as a platform for probing nonequilibrium emergent magnetic phenomena, thereby broadening the role of analog quantum computers into foundational questions in condensed matter physics."

However, current regional-scale methods lack the spatial precision needed to improve understanding of the drivers of these fluxes to inform strategies aimed at maximizing landscape carbon storage. Here, we develop an alternative and highly constrained procedure for estimating wildfire emissions at both local (10 meters) and regional (1000 kilometers) scales in boreal Fennoscandia. This approach reassessed existing knowledge of heat development within the context of modern geospatial datasets, revealing expanded applications of satellite-derived fire radiative power in classifying distinct smoldering dynamics. The findings additionally emphasized the importance of capturing fine-scale variation in climate-sensitive fuel loading when determining regional fire season impact. Comparisons revealed substantial limitations in existing boreal carbon accounting methods while providing insights into the sensitivity of fire regime characteristics to climate, management, and landscape structure."

In two-dimensional (2D) materials, applied stress often induces out-of-plane deformation, resulting in a more intricate three-dimensional (3D) topography, where mapping the strain remains a challenge due to the limitations of conventional characterization techniques. In this work, we introduce BRIGHT (Bragg-Rod Informed, Gradient-based Height-mapping Technique), an integrated method for reconstructing both the topography and planar strain profile of 3D-structured 2D materials using nanobeam four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM). We apply BRIGHT to a MoS2-MoSe2transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) lateral heterojunctions exhibiting built-in strain and out-of-plane ripples and show that varying heterojunction widths lead to distinct surface morphologies and corresponding changes in the planar strain distribution. These results establish a foundation for more effective strain engineering in 2D materials by accounting for out-of-plane structural features, thereby enabling more precise control of strain-dependent properties."

Dopaminergic neurons, known to encode reward expectation and prediction error, are prime candidates for linking value and vigor. Here, we show that human reach vigor dynamically tracks canonical dopaminergic learning signals not only at movement onset but also during ongoing motion. Using a reaching task with probabilistic rewards (0, 33, 66, and 100%), we observed that peak velocity scaled with expected value. Crucially, following feedback, reach velocity was transiently invigorated or enervated in proportion to the sign and magnitude of the reward prediction error. Trial-by-trial changes in kinematics reflected value updating, consistent with dopaminergic phasic learning signals. These results demonstrate that movement vigor is modulated by reward-learning signals on rapid timescales, revealing a real-time behavioral readout of motivational computation in the brain."

Here, we propose a generalized trap model for activated aging based on a key static property of the energy landscape: the distribution of energy barriers. Our theory predicts that, upon cooling, weak ergodicity breaking (WEB) in quenching dynamics occurs before strong ergodicity breaking in equilibrium dynamics. Furthermore, the theory indicates that the characteristic size of activation clusters can be deduced from the logarithmic decay of the time-correlation function. We rigorously test the model’s assumptions and predictions using the simplest spin glass model, the random energy model. The predicted aging behavior is also universally observed in paradigmatic structural glasses, including the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) model and amorphous silica. Applying our framework to the WCA model allows us to extract a static length from the nonequilibrium dynamics, extending its observable growth range from a mere factor of 2 to 3 to a full order of magnitude and providing supportive evidence for the random first-order transition scenario. Last, we propose a unified ergodic-WEB phase diagram for aging dynamics in general glassy systems."

Here, we established a systematic CRISPR-based protein-tagging approach that enables direct, unambiguous comparison of nuclear localization and genome-wide binding profiles of endogenous ZAD-ZnFs in developingDrosophilaembryos. Evidence is provided that a subset of ZAD-ZnFs forms nuclear condensates through the stacking of the N-terminal ZAD dimerization surface. Disruption of condensation activity leads to misregulation of genome-wide binding profiles and lethality, underscoring its functional and physiological significance in development. Integrative chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and Micro-C analyses reveal that many ZAD-ZnFs colocalize with core insulator proteins such as CCCTC-binding factor and Centrosomal protein 190 kD to control the formation of topological boundaries. We suggest that the diverse molecular functions of ZAD-ZnFs have evolutionarily arisen from their ancestral role as insulator-binding proteins."

Threat is also theorized as a universal experience—affecting potentially anyone, across any of their identities. Here, we put these central aspects of theory to the test by introducing the Social Identity Threat Concerns (SITC) Inventory, a self-report instrument designed to assess threat across varied identity-by-context situations. Across nine studies (N= 8533), we show that threat is common across social groups yet situational, emerging under specific, theorized conditions.

The double-electron oxygen reduction reaction has become a more environmentally friendly alternative method for producing H2O2. However, at high overpotentials, the production and conversion rates of H2O2are still limited. Here, we report an electrochemical method that can convert H2O and formaldehyde into high-concentration H2O2and high-value formate salts with high product purity under environmental conditions. At a current density of 30 milliamperes per square centimeter, continuous operation for 5 hours can produce 6.522% (m/v) H2O2, and the product does not contain acid, alkali, or excessive impurities.

However, therapeutically targetable mediators of innate immune bacterial killing remain elusive. We hypothesized that immune-adaptive pathogen evolution could provide an informative perspective on this problem. We examined the interaction of a genetically diverging hypervirulentStreptococcus pneumoniae(pneumococcus) serotype with macrophages, identifying closely phylogenetically related isolates with differential susceptibility to intracellular killing. We reasoned that macrophage genes relatively suppressed during pathogen escape from killing were likely to encode mediators normally promoting bacterial killing. This led to the validation of ACOD1 and its product itaconate, NAMPT, and P2RX7 as host defense factors against pneumococci and related gram-positive pathogens. Last, we repurposed the antihistamine clemastine to augment phagolysosomal bacterial killing, via P2RX7, as a candidate host-directed therapy against pneumococci and vancomycin-resistantEnterococcus faecium. Overall, we show that pathogen-centric host screening can aid identification of microbicidal responses as targets for host-directed therapies."

Here, we propose an impact-driven magnetic untethered miniature robot (RoboIMP) capable of delivering repeatable high-force outputs of up to 3 N, surpassing the theoretical force limits of conventional magnetic robots at the same characteristic length. RoboIMP uses reciprocal oscillation to fluidize the surrounding medium, thereby reducing the resistance from the medium by up to 13-fold.

Iron deficiency was associated with 50% reducedP. falciparumparasitemia in pregnant women [95% CI (30 to 64%),P< 0.0001], while iron-deficient mice exhibited improved survival againstP. berghei(median 15.5 days versus 7.0 days for WT mice) and protection from cerebral malaria (83% versus 17% survival). Iron chelation substantially changed the transcriptomic and proteomic profile of culturedP. falciparumparasites. Intravenous iron supplementation did not increase parasitemia when coupled with malaria prevention. These findings demonstrate that iron deficiency protects againstPlasmodiuminfection and support World Health Organization recommendations for iron supplementation in malaria-endemic regions when combined with adequate malaria prevention strategies in place."

The cytoprotective role of RTAs has been increasingly recognized as essential in regulating ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death driven by lipid peroxidation. However, current ferroptosis inhibitors primarily rely on phenolic or aromatic amine scaffolds, which were found through high-throughput screening or derived from historically known RTAs. We introduce hydrazine-derived tetrahydro-1,2,4,5-tetrazin-3-ones (THTZOs) as a class of nonclassical RTAs. THTZOs operate via a unique mechanism involving hydrazyl and verdazyl radical intermediates that is independent of aromatic stabilization. These compounds demonstrate broad reactivity against autoxidation in both simple hydrocarbons and membrane phospholipids, effectively suppressing ferroptosis induced by RAS-selective lethal 3 (RSL3) or erastin in multiple cell lines.

On the downside, resonant-based sensors are susceptible to cavity imperfections, local mechanical disturbances (temperature variations, vibrations), and other experimental uncertainties. Here, we overcome this problem by experimentally implementing passive periodic microwave metamaterials with nonresonant EPDs (NR-EPDs) occurring in their Bloch spectrum. We demonstrate a sublinear variation of the reflectance near NR-EPDs to a specific class of (global) perturbations and propose its usage for ultrasensitive sensing that is immune to undesired (local) perturbations.

Reeves,Global maps of transcription factor properties reveal threshold-based formation of DNA-bound and mobile clusters,"The relationship between bulk transcription factor concentration and DNA binding has been a central question in gene regulation for decades. Recent studies propose that DNA-bound transcription factor hubs, or clusters, aid in fast and precise transcriptional interpretation. Using live imaging techniques, we quantify the concentration, binding, and mobility of the morphogen Dorsal (Dl), both in bulk and in clusters, inDrosophilablastoderm embryo. Our experiments encompass multiple length and timescales, allowing us to obtain a nucleus-wide view of the mechanism connecting hub formation to bulk Dl concentration. Our results show that previously unobserved, slowly moving clusters of Dl are present, in addition to the expected populations of freely mobile and DNA-bound Dl. Furthermore, both mobile clusters and DNA-bound Dl appear only once a threshold concentration in the nucleus is surpassed, a behavior consistent with liquid-liquid phase separation. Thus, our work elucidates how bulk transcription factor concentration dictates the formation and spatiotemporal changes of different populations needed for gene regulation."

Sperm motility is the key to conception. However, the immunological mechanism for environmental stress–induced sperm motility reduction remains unknown. Our experiments find that three classical environmental stressors, including lead, cadmium, and mercury, are the key heavy metals reducing sperm motility. We reveal that environmental stress induces epididymal macrophage senescence, whereas the clearance of above cells significantly alleviates environmental stress–reduced sperm motility. In vivo and in vitro experiments further demonstrate that environmental stress induces macrophage senescence via down-regulatingFoxo3expression. Mechanistically, environmental stress increases the epididymalFoxo3 N6-methyladenosine level and inhibits the FTO. Overexpression ofFtoin vitro andS-adenosylhomocysteine supplementation in vivo alleviates environmental stress–induced macrophage senescence. Together, these results suggest that epididymal macrophage senescence contributes to sperm motility decrease upon environmental stress. Clearing senescent epididymal macrophages will provide a previously unknown strategy for preventing male infertility."

Walsh,"Enabling Fieldwork for All (EFFA) Framework: Supporting physical, social, financial, and psychological safety in the field","Calls to address fieldwork safety that began in the 1980s have been amplified and expanded in the past decade by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and US federal funding agencies. Now, research on fieldwork safety and resulting recommendations are largely siloed by scientific discipline, limiting the spread of data and discussion that could yield rapid change for field research. This review synthesizes literature on fieldwork safety across scientific disciplines, highlighting four facets of safety for leaders and researchers to address: physical, social, financial, and psychological. Literature and real-life events demonstrate that the four facets of safety are interconnected and should be considered together. The review concludes with a synthesis of recommendations for each facet of safety. This review provides principal investigators with accessible, data-driven resources and propose a framework for future research on field safety that will enable cross-disciplinary sharing."
