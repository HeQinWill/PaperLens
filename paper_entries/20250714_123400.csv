10.5194/acp-25-7227-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文利用卫星观测数据和再分析数据，结合机器学习方法，探讨了卷云的形成机制以及矿物沙尘对卷云微物理特性的影响。研究发现，不同形成机制下，沙尘浓度的增加可能导致冰晶数量的减少或增加。具体来说，对于液态来源的卷云，沙尘浓度增加可能导致冰晶数量减少，而对于高空原位形成的卷云，沙尘浓度增加可能导致冰晶数量增加。这一发现对通过云播撒来冷却地球的设想提出了挑战，因为它可能意外地导致气候变暖。研究使用了DARDAR-Nice卫星反演产品和MERRA2再分析数据，涉及卫星观测、大气成分分析（沙尘气溶胶）以及气溶胶与云相互作用等大气环境遥感技术。,"['cirrus clouds', 'mineral dust', 'satellite observations', 'ice crystal number concentration', 'ice water content', 'aerosol-cloud interaction', 'radiative effect', 'MERRA2 reanalysis data', 'DARDAR-Nice retrieval product']",Kai Jeggle;David Neubauer;Hanin Binder;Ulrike Lohmann,Cirrus formation regimes – data-driven identification and quantification of mineral dust effect,"This work uncovers the formation regimes of cirrus clouds and how dust particles influence their properties. By applying machine learning to a combination of satellite and reanalysis data, cirrus clouds are classified into different formation regimes. Depending on the regime, increasing dust aerosol concentrations can either decrease or increase the number of ice crystals. This challenges the idea of using cloud seeding to cool the planet, as it may unintentionally lead to warming instead. 
 The microphysical and radiative properties of cirrus clouds are strongly dependent on the ice nucleation mechanism and origin of the ice crystals. Due to sparse temporal coverage of satellite data and limited observations of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) at cirrus levels, it is notoriously hard to determine the origin of the ice and the nucleation mechanism of cirrus clouds in satellite observations. In this work we combine 3 years of satellite observations of cirrus clouds from the DARDAR-Nice retrieval product with Lagrangian trajectories of reanalysis data of meteorological and aerosol variables calculated 12 h backward in time for each observed cirrus cloud. In a first step, we identify typical cirrus cloud formation regimes by clustering the Lagrangian trajectories and characterize observed microphysical properties for in situ and liquid origin cirrus clouds in mid-latitudes and the tropics. On average, in situ cirrus clouds have smaller ice water content (IWC) and lower ice crystal number concentration (Nice) and a strong negative temperature dependence of Nice, while liquid origin cirrus have a larger IWC, higher Nice and a strong positive temperature dependence of IWC. In a second step, we use MERRA2 reanalysis data to quantify the sensitivity of cirrus cloud microphysical properties to a change in the concentration of dust particles that may act as INPs. By identifying similar cirrus cloud formation pathways, we can condition on ice origin, region, and meteorological dependencies, and quantify the impact of dust particles for different formation regimes. We find that at cloud-top median Nice decreases with increasing dust concentrations for liquid origin cirrus. Specifically, the sensitivities are between 6 % and 7 % per order of magnitude increase in dust in the tropics and between 15 % in the mid-latitudes. The decrease in Nice can be explained by increased heterogeneous ice nucleation in the mixed-phase regime, leading to fewer cloud droplets freezing homogeneously once the cloud enters the cirrus temperatures and glaciates. The resulting fewer, but larger, ice crystals are more likely to sediment, leading to reduced IWC, as for example observed for liquid origin cirrus in the mid-latitudes. In contrast, for high-altitude in situ cirrus in the tropics, we find an increase of Nice median values of 11 % and IWC median values of 17 % per unit increase of dust aerosol in logarithmic space. We assume that this is caused by heterogeneous nucleation of ice initiated by dust INPs in INP-limited conditions with supersaturations between the heterogeneous and homogeneous freezing thresholds. Such conditions frequently occur at high altitudes, especially in tropical regions at temperatures below 200 K.Our results provide an observational line of evidence that the climate intervention method of seeding cirrus clouds with potent INPs may potentially result in an undesired positive cloud radiative effect (CRE), i.e., a warming effect. Instead of producing fewer but larger ice crystals, we show that additional INPs can lead to an increase in Nice and IWC, an effect called overseeding."

Here, we evaluated the aging and neurodegenerative effects of F-53B using the C. elegans model. After exposure to F-53B at 2, 10, and 50 ng/L, C. elegans showed an aging phenomenon as lipofuscin was significantly increased by 48.7–57.5% and locomotion, such as center point speed, was significantly decreased in all exposure groups. F-53B also induced Parkinson’s disease (PD)-like disorders including dyskinesia (incidence: 22.8–27.9%), dopaminergic neuronal damage (neuritic blebbings and broken neurites) and decreased dopamine levels (15.2–28.1%), increased abundance (1.3–1.4 fold) and aggregation of α-synuclein. Inhibition of antioxidant enzymes and disruption of the normal dopamine cycle via promoting DAT-1 were observed in C. elegans after F-53B exposure, consequently contributing to the increased level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Such oxidative stress led to notable mitochondrial damage as gene expression related to mitochondrial morphology and function including pink1, pdr-1, fis1, and djr was significantly suppressed in all exposure groups, which could contribute to the aging and PD-like disorders observed above as ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction were well demonstrated to be important inducers for aging and PD. All the adverse effects of F-53B were observed at concentrations equivalent to or even lower than those detected in environmental media and human samples, suggesting that F-53B might have posed a substantial health risk to the elderly population and warrants stricter environmental regulation."

The Andaman Sea (AS), a key semi‐enclosed sea connecting to the Bay of Bengal, has lacked sufficient observational data to understand its intermediate circulation. Based on advanced reanalysis data sets, for the first time, we here report a very interesting natural phenomenon, that is, the basin‐wide intermediate circulation of the AS changes its direction twice yearly between cyclonic and anticyclonic, somewhat like a YOYO being played by a kid. A further insightful analysis based on numerical experiments demonstrates that it is the Kelvin waves propagating from the equatorial Indian Ocean that drive basin‐wide intermediate circulation with a semi‐annual cycle under the constraint law of the potential vorticity conservation. This finding highlights the critical role of equatorial Kelvin waves in driving the AS intermediate circulation, advancing our understanding of circulation dynamics in a marginal sea like the AS."

The statistically significant decline in inter‐series correlations (p < 0.01) represents a previously unknown aspect of global hydroclimate dynamics. We hypothesize that the disruption was driven by ENSO weakening and/or by a large‐scale multi‐decadal reconfiguration of ocean‐atmosphere circulation. Data assimilation estimates of soil moisture from the same regions fail to produce results of the same magnitude, potentially due to an overreliance of ENSO influence on the boundaries of spatial covariance in the underlying climate models."

The degree of anisotropy evolves dynamically as ice crystals align during deformation into macroscopic patterns termed ice fabric. Radar polarimetry is an emerging tool to detect such patterns, particularly using nadir‐looking antenna geometries sensitive to horizontal anisotropy. Although theoretical studies discussed oblique incidence of radio waves to detect vertical anisotropy and relax the assumption of vertical fabric alignment, so far no data were available to test this. Here, we analyze a polarimetric common midpoint survey from Ekström Ice Shelf and develop a framework to invert all relevant ice fabric components. We find that our data not only detect the expected deep ice fabric, but are also significantly impacted by structural anisotropy of near‐surface firn. This has been neglected in previous studies and introduces tradeoffs between both effects in the inversion. It also opens up new possibilities for investigating firn with radar polarimetry."

Existing models attribute this curvature to a progressive attenuation of the effect of postglacial sea‐level rise or sediment redistribution by modern coastal‐marine processes. Here, we present an alternative framework in which shelf curvature arises from an inherent self‐organizing mechanism. During sea‐level rise, if the critical length of the downstream alluvial river is exceeded, deltaic sedimentation cannot be sustained. In this non‐deltaic transgressive regime, the alluvial aggradation rate autogenically increases as the river shrinks, enhancing alluvial sediment accumulation and producing a steeper local shelf slope closer to the shoreline. Two‐dimensional geometric modeling reveals a simple governing equation for the self‐organized curvature of the shelf profile, with support from flume‐tank experiments and applications to modern systems, providing a mechanistic basis for interpreting existing shelf profiles."

Suresh Babu,Energy‐Balance Decomposition of the Aerosol‐Induced Changes on Surface Temperature Over South Asia,"Aerosol‐radiation interactions decrease the solar radiation reaching the surface, which cools the surface and influences land‐atmosphere interactions and affects the regional climate through various pathways. To estimate the change in radiative and nonradiative fluxes due to aerosol‐radiation interactions, regional climate model simulations were carried out over the South Asian region. Using the energy balance equation, aerosol‐induced changes in surface temperature are decomposed into its radiative (shortwave (SW) and longwave) and nonradiative (sensible heat flux (SHF), latent heat flux (LHF), and ground flux) components for different seasons. This study showed that the surface cooling due to the decrease in SW radiation is mainly compensated by the decrease in SHF in all seasons. The decrease in SHF is more than 50% of the decrease in SW radiation due to aerosols over the Indo‐Gangetic Plain (IGP). Aerosol‐induced changes in incoming longwave radiation have a cooling effect over the Indian region except over the western part of South Asia. The aerosol‐induced changes in LHF are highly heterogeneous and insignificant except for monsoon season. Over IGP, the decrease in LHF compensates nearly 15% of the SW cooling due to aerosols during monsoon season. Over the Indian region, approximately 40%–50% of the SW cooling due to aerosols is translated to net change in surface temperature, whereas the remaining is adjusted by the decrease of SHF and LHF. Notably, the impact of aerosol‐induced weakening of SHF remains unexplored but holds profound implications for the hydroclimate and air quality of the Indian subcontinent."

Due to diverse source regions and changes during long‐range transport, dust aerosols exhibit varying mineralogical compositions, leading to distinct regional optical and microphysical properties. However, the impact of mineralogical composition on satellite‐based dust property retrievals is far from being well understood. This study develops a physics‐based synergistic retrieval system to infer two fundamental properties, dust aerosol optical thickness (DAOT) and effective radius, leveraging observations from the Cloud‐Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) and Infrared Imaging Radiometer (IIR) onboard the Cloud‐Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellite. This algorithm relies on the TAMUdust2020 aerosol single‐scattering database with a region‐ and mineralogy‐dependent refractive index data set and does not depend on an empirical assumption about the lidar ratio. Through simulations and retrievals utilizing a region‐specific dust optical property model, this study demonstrates that the measurements made by CALIOP and IIR, as well as the retrievals of DAOT and effective particle radius, are significantly influenced by the mineralogical composition of dust aerosols, exhibiting distinct behavior that varies depending on their source regions. This influence is particularly pronounced for dust aerosols originating from Taklamakan, Namib, Niger, and Australia, which underscores the importance of incorporating regional mineralogical variations into the retrieval process."

Joint ROAM‐V/radiosonde deployments focused on sampling polluted marine and continental air masses to understand summertime convection along and across the sea‐breeze front as it propagated through Houston. The polluted marine air mass at Seawolf Park, Galveston, TX was defined by two characteristic aerosol populations. Although the background total particle concentrations averaged 2,500 cm−3, the air mass was also influenced by frequent but irregular periods of ship emission with significantly higher aerosol concentrations at times exceeding 34,000 cm−3. Ship emission influenced periods, typically lasting <10 min, contained smaller, less hygroscopic particles resulting in a 69% relative decline in cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activated fraction at 1% supersaturation compared to background periods. Measurements in continental air masses northwest of Houston revealed an average aerosol concentration of 5,208 cm−3 with a κ value near 0.1 reasonably describing the CCN population, independent of particle size. In continental air masses, substantial differences in particle size and CCN activation over small distances (<42 miles between sites) suggest considerable site‐to‐site variability in addition to the expected day‐to‐day differences. This small‐scale variability makes it difficult to generalize continental air mass aerosol properties. Both coastal and inland locations had effective ice nucleating particles, but inland deployments observed the warmest nucleation temperature at −15.6°C compared to −17.8°C close to the coast. These measurements can reduce uncertainties in regional convection allowing models to improve understanding of aerosol‐cloud interactions."

Addressing the current issues of low utilization of infrared imagery information and insufficient extraction of domain knowledge, we employ objective techniques to extract convective features related to cloud organization from infrared imagery. These features, along with satellite imagery and historical intensity values, are selected as model inputs. This paper introduces a deep learning model designed for the short‐term prediction of TC intensity in the Northwest Pacific by fusing satellite imagery and convective features (TCISP‐fusion). We developed a spatiotemporal feature extraction module to capture high‐level features from the spatio‐temporal sequences of satellite imagery and convective features. Additionally, we introduced a spatiotemporal feature fusion module to integrate asymmetrically distributed convective features while minimizing information loss during feature extraction. Furthermore, we applied the Laplacian Pyramid Image Fusion algorithm to effectively combine observations from the infrared (IR) and water vapor (WV) channels. This method captures large‐scale cloud system structures and retains small‐scale detailed features, generating high‐contrast fused imagery and reducing the complexity of input data. The TCISP‐fusion model achieves a root mean square error of 10.87 kt for 24‐hr intensity prediction of western North Pacific TCs. Compared to traditional and mainstream methods, our model achieves comparable accuracy while significantly reducing the required human and material resources. The data used ensure real‐time applicability, making it highly valuable for operational applications."

Significant tree mortality can occur years after fire events, but this has received little attention compared to the immediate tree loss during a fire. We overlapped forest cover loss data with burn severity maps in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and quantified the total and delayed forest canopy loss after fires. We found that wildfires resulted in total canopy loss fraction (CLF) of 84%, 53%, and 22% within 3 years in areas burned at high, moderate, and low severity, respectively. The delayed canopy loss accounted for approximately 1/3, 1/2, and 2/3 of the total canopy loss for high, moderate, and low severity burns. Delayed canopy loss was greater in moist and cool areas than in dry and warm areas, likely because tree species in wetter environments were less adapted to survive when fires did occur. Across all forests, delayed CLF doubled as temperature increased from the climatological mean to a hot anomaly and tripled as vapor pressure deficit increased from a wet anomaly to a dry anomaly. Fire impacts on forest ecosystems are likely to intensify under future climate scenarios as wildfires expand into areas that historically experienced infrequent fires. The impacts can also be exacerbated by more frequent compound extreme events, such as droughts, heatwaves, and fires. These findings highlight the urgent need for targeted forest management strategies, particularly in mesic forests, to mitigate future fire impacts."

Refining glacier projections and sources of uncertainty thus supports climate adaptation and mitigation. Here we explicitly quantify the impact of internal climate variability and climate data bias adjustment methods on regional and global glacier projections through 2100 for various emissions scenarios. Uncertainty from internal climate variability is comparable to climate model structural uncertainty (i.e., arising from physical representations and parameter settings) in the coming decades at the regional level, but is not a major source of uncertainty in centennial global glacier projections. Bias adjustment options (method and time period) moderately impact projections at regional and glacier scales, but have a smaller impact (∼2% of global glacier mass at 2100, relative to 2020) at global scales. In some regions, the uncertainty due to internal climate variability is larger than climate model structural uncertainty for the entirety of the 21st century, and bias adjustment options can nearly double the regional uncertainty by 2100. At the glacier scale, bias adjustments can lead to differences in projected decadal and centennial mass loss of up to 30%, although these greatest differences are associated with the smallest (<1 km2) glaciers. Overall, internal climate variability and climate data bias adjustment methods are important to consider, especially in regional applications, to better estimate uncertainty in future sea‐level rise and water resources availability."

This study uses field observations and dynamic modeling to investigate drivers of groundwater variability and to project flooding risks from emergent groundwater in Imperial Beach, California. Hourly groundwater table data from four monitoring wells (2021–2024) reveal distinct aquifer behaviors across soil types. In transmissive coastal sandy soils, groundwater levels are dominated by ocean tides, with secondary contributions from non‐tidal sea level variability and seasonal recharge. In this setting, we calibrated an empirical groundwater model to observations, and forced the model with regional SLR scenarios. We project that groundwater emergence along the low‐lying coastal road will begin by the 2060s under intermediate SLR trajectories, and escalate to near‐daily flooding by 2100. Over 20% of San Diego County's coastline shares similar transmissive sandy geology and thus similar flooding risk. Results underscore the urgency of integrating groundwater hazards into coastal resilience planning, as current adaptation strategies in Imperial Beach—focused on surface flooding—are insufficient to address infrastructure vulnerabilities from below. This study provides a transferable framework for assessing groundwater‐driven flooding in transmissive coastal aquifers, where SLR‐induced groundwater rise threatens critical infrastructure decades before permanent inundation."

However, few studies thoroughly investigated the distribution and driving factors of global CEIH, even though a considerable amount of cropland has extended to the highlands over recent decades. To investigate CEIH, we employed spatial statistics, elevation spectrum analysis, and terrain gradient methods to quantify spatio‐temporal patterns and elevation changes in global cropland distribution from 1995 to 2020. We then explored the key driving factors of CEIH at different scales using spatial regression models and multiscale geo‐weighted regression model. The results revealed that global average cropland elevation increased from 422.782 m in 1995 to 427.321 m in 2020, representing a 4.539 m net increase. CEIH was reflected on both global and continental scales in all continents except South America during the study period. Furthermore, CEIH showed an intense agglomeration pattern. Human activities and cropland reclamation rate emerged as the primary underlying driving factors of CEIH. The encroachment of development on lowland agricultural areas forced CEIH, which was the core of this phenomenon. Vertical cropland expansion was predominantly concentrated in ecologically vulnerable highlands and ecological transition zones. The driving factors of CEIH exhibited spatial and multiscale heterogeneity.

It suggests how the Anthropocene concept may be more effectively understood and used in relationship to these two dimensions."

 Electron avalanche breakdown plays a pivotal role in determining the efficiency and reliability of semiconductors and insulators in micro-nanoelectronics and power systems. However, it still remains challenging to understand and control this transient non-equilibrium process. Here, we propose and demonstrate an atomic-scale electron avalanche breakdown model to investigate the dynamic behaviors of excited electrons under extremely high electric fields in various dielectrics ranging from simple oxides to perovskites. Using high-throughput calculations, we establish the relationship maps between ionization energy, bond energy, electron mean free path and breakdown strength, and then excavate their mathematical expressions. On this basis, a high-entropy strategy in BaTiO3-based dielectrics with controllable lattice distortion is well designed to regulate the electron avalanche process, which successfully achieves a ~ 250% improvement in the breakdown strength by preventing electrons from acquiring sufficient energy. The atomic-scale understanding of electron avalanche breakdown process provides more refined guidance for atom/defect engineering to break the universal rule of inverse relation between breakdown strength and permittivity in dielectrics. Here the authors propose an atomic-scale electron avalanche breakdown model to investigate the dynamic behaviors of excited electrons under extremely high electric fields in various dielectrics ranging from simple oxides to perovskites."

Here, the authors report a bioinspired sulfo-oxygen bridge that optimizes the interfacial water structure to boost hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions. 
 Uncovering the dynamic structures of water at the electrode-solution interface is crucial for various electrocatalysis processes, where water acts as a proton and electron source. However, precisely controlling the state of water on complex interfaces remains challenging. Inspired by the metalloproteins in natural enzymes, we herein demonstrate that the hydrophilic sulfo-oxygen bridging between Co and Ru sites (Cos-SO-Ru) optimizes interfacial water structure via a favorable hydrogen-bond network, promoting hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions. Mechanistic studies reveal that the stereoscopic sulfo-oxygen bridges enhance the connectivity of hydrogen-bond network to promote the proton transfer process via repelling cations from the electrode surface. Furthermore, electron donating Co sites reduce the surface oxophilicity of Ru to optimize the adsorption-desorption behaviors of hydroxyl, governing the timely refreshed Ru sites to enhance catalytic performances. Such bioinspired active sites offer a different pathway for the precise design of interfacial water structure to improve electrocatalysis.

Here, the authors design a column using micron-sized water droplets covered by ion-ligand complexes for efficient separations. 
 Despite significant advances in membrane technology, achieving efficient separation in organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) remains a major challenge in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, particularly when dealing with multicomponent molecular mixtures. To address this, in this study, we develop a biphasic column for organic solvent membrane extraction, which consists of closely packed micron-sized water droplets covered by sub-nanometer-thick ion-ligand complexes that serve as size-exclusive membranes. Molecular mixtures dissolved in an organic solvent can be selectively extracted into the droplets through the interfacial complexes based on their sizes, while the solvent flows through the micron-scale interstices between the droplets. This solute-solvent dual pathway design minimizes resistance in solvent convection, resulting in high productivity, while simultaneously achieving a high separation factor through the monodisperse nanopores of the interfacial complexes. Using aluminum ion-carboxylate terminated polydimethylsiloxane complexes as a representative, the column demonstrates a controllable, high separation factor of 600 with a productivity of 1100 L·m−2·hour−1·bar−1 in cyclohexane, significantly outperforming conventional membrane OSN.

 Long-distance microbial transport via dust events is projected to intensify globally. However, survival mechanisms of air- and dust-borne bacteria and their contribution to global processes remain poorly understood. In this study, we characterized Bacillus species from transitional season dust storms, previously identified as a significant component of the bioactive community of the dust microbiome. Our results demonstrated substantial growth and surface-associated biofilm formation diversification, linked to niche adaptation within heterogeneous dust particles. Most dust isolates formed biofilms while showing varying preferences for media composition under standard laboratory conditions, extreme temperatures, and low humidity. Sterile dust stimulated biofilm formation, growth, and matrix gene expression of B. subtilis, leading to robust biofilm development in key related dust isolates. This effect surpassed that of inorganic, synthetic dust, representing a role for organic substrates from decayed dust-community members. Overall, these findings offer direct evidence that biofilm formation serves as an adaptive mechanism in the unique habitat of dust particles, suggesting that niche adaptation may play a role in microbial survival across dust storms. These results hold significant implications for terrestrial and aquatic ecology and health, suggesting a pivotal process by which bacteria survive and evolve in this understudied habitat.

 Anthropogenic CO2 emissions, particularly from strong point sources like power plants, play a crucial role in the increase of atmospheric CO2 through a complex interaction with the natural carbon sinks. China successfully launched the Atmospheric Environment Monitoring Satellite (AEMS) loaded with integrated path differential absorption (IPDA) lidar and high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) on April 16, 2022. This satellite is capable of simultaneously detecting atmospheric CO2 and aerosols. Using AEMS data, we developed a point-source emission retrieval algorithm based on a modified three-dimensional Gaussian plume model and applied it to 12 satellite overpasses of major power plants. Compared with emissions reported by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), our retrievals exhibit an average relative deviation of 6.23 % in the validation cases, which represents a 31.63 % reduction in error compared to the traditional two-dimensional model-based method. In all cases, the estimated emissions exhibit strong agreement with EPA data (R = 0.84) and a low mean absolute error (MAE) of 6.1 kt/day. The analysis indicates that the uncertainty of the emission inversion results ranges from about 12 % to 21 %, with an average of 17.1 %. These results demonstrate the ability of the IPDA–HSRL synergy to accurately quantify point source CO2 emissions, and can supplement and verify existing bottom-up inventory methods."

 Source apportionment of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) provides scientific basis for the prevention of ozone (O3) and particulate matter pollution, while bias exists in the receptor model based on the measured concentration. We conducted online measurement of hourly ambient concentrations for multiple VOCs species in January and July 2023 in Lianyungang, a city with fast growing industry in east China, and five major sources of VOCs were identified with an improved application of the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model by considering photochemical losses and formation potential of secondary aerosols (SOAP) and O3 (OFP). For January and July, the total VOCs (TVOC) concentrations were measured at 23.7 ± 10.8 and 12.0 ± 7.5 ppbv, and the averaged consumed VOCs due to photochemical losses in daytime reached 3.12 and 3.08 ppb, respectively. The concentrations were generally lower than those in Chinese mega cities. As the important emission from industrial sources, Oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) were found to occupy a significant position in the concentration structure of TVOCs and photochemical losses in Lianyungang. Inclusion of photochemical losses avoided underestimation of contribution from solvent usage and overestimation of vehicle emissions in summer. There was a significant difference between source contributions based on concentrations and environmental impacts (SOAP in winter and OFP in summer). For the latter, coal burning was identified as the most important source in January, and industrial emissions and solvent usage in July. Indicated by the backward trajectories, local emissions were the dominant contributor to the VOCs pollution, mainly from the large ports and industrial parks, while industrial emissions from nearby provinces (Shandong and Anhui) were also important. The analyses provide scientific evidences for determining the priorities of VOCs emission controls for cities with fast industrialization."

 Residential solid fuel combustion is a significant contributor to air pollution in Hungary, particularly in rural areas. This study aimed to assess air pollution attributable to residential solid combustion by monitoring the spatial and temporal variability of PM2.5 mass concentration and other specific air pollutants. Sampling campaigns were conducted at rural and urban sites with differing heating habits, comparing heating and non-heating periods in 2020.Significant differences in air pollutant concentrations were observed between the two periods. At the rural site, the mean PM2.5 mass concentration was 1.7 times higher during the heating period compared to the urban site. Biomass burning markers (e.g. levoglucosan, potassium, organic carbon in PM2.5) showed a significant associations during the heating period. Additionally, the universal waste burning marker 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene was detected on 93% of the measurement days at the rural site during the heating period, indicating continuous waste burning. The results of 14C analysis and multiple diagnostic ratios further supported source identification. The annual target value for benzo(a)pyrene (1 ng/m3) was exceeded in 100% of samples collected at the rural site and 64% of samples at the urban site during the heating period.

 Bacteria are important components of bioaerosols as a potential source of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in the atmosphere. Previous studies have shown that bacteria can be activated as CCN, but the reported CCN forming potential can vary greatly among different studies and for different types of bacteria. In particular, the effect of atmospheric aging on the CCN activity of bacteria under atmospheric relevant conditions remains largely unknown. In this study, the CCN activity of airborne Escherichia coli (E. coli) was determined and the effects of biological aging and atmospheric exposures were examined by chamber simulation experiments. Results showed that the aerosolized E. coli particles displayed a bimodal size distribution, with a larger particle mode composed of whole cells and a smaller mode composed of bacterial fragments that were present at much higher number concentrations. The calculated hygroscopicity parameter κ was 0.08 ± 0.01 for the cell, and 0.16 ± 0.01 for the fragments in the presence of purified air. The CCN activity and hygroscopicity of E. coli varied significantly under different experimental conditions, with the magnitude of the change depending on the degree of aging, the atmospheric conditions and the type of pollutant gas. An even larger increase in κ was observed under actual ambient air compared with any single exposure. Our study indicates that the CCN activity of bioaerosols previously measured in the laboratory may not be applicable to real atmospheric conditions because the effects of atmospheric aging were not taken into account. Due to the sensitivity to environmental conditions, the cloud nucleating abilities of bioaerosols may be underestimated. Therefore, atmospheric interactions need to be considered in assessing the contribution of bioaerosols to the atmospheric CCN population and hence the impact on indirect climate forcing."

 This study systematically investigates the vertical structure characteristics and driving mechanisms of tropospheric aerosols over the North China Plain (NCP) based on Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) aerosol profiles from 2007 to 2022, combining K-means clustering, regression analysis, and Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry model (WRF-Chem) simulations. Seasonal cluster analysis identified four typical vertical structures during daytime, with the Elevated Aerosol Layer (EAL) in summer being the most prominent. Significant aerosol accumulation occurs within the 500–1500 m height range during this season, contributing nearly 50 % of the tropospheric Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD). Analysis of long-term CALIOP data further revealed a significant decreasing trend in AOD over the study region between 2013 and 2020, a change closely linked to emission reduction policies implemented during the same period. To delve deeper into the causes of the aerosol accumulation phenomenon at 500–1500 m and the influencing factors and vertical distribution characteristics of the AOD decline, we designed WRF-Chem sensitivity experiments combined with regression analysis. The results indicate that both emission factors and meteorological factors influence AOD, but their dominance varies with height: emissions primarily affect near-surface aerosols below 500 m, while meteorology dominates the variations at heights of 500–1500 m. Specifically, hygroscopic growth, thermal convection, bounce and resuspension of coarse particles, and long-range transport collectively enhance aerosol accumulation at 500–1500 m. Consequently, policy-driven emission reductions significantly lowered near-surface aerosol concentrations, which is crucial for mitigating population exposure risks. However, the aerosol accumulation phenomenon at 500–1500 m persists regardless of emission changes, as it is primarily driven by meteorological factors."
