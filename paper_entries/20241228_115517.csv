10.1088/1748-9326/ad984e,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究了整合多卫星全球降水测量（IMERG）产品在捕捉气候趋势方面的能力。IMERG是一个高时空分辨率的全球降水产品套件，由近实时和研究级产品组成。该研究使用Mann-Kendall分析方法，以地面雨量计记录为基准，分析了2001年至2019年期间IMERG最终版（版本06）的逐年降水趋势，并比较了热带降雨测量任务（TRMM）时期（2001-2014年）和全球降水测量任务（GPM）时期（2015-2019年）的性能。结果表明，IMERG在GPM时期的表现优于TRMM时期，这表明GPM时期提高了IMERG准确追踪全球降水趋势的能力。研究使用了三种不同的匹配策略：在雨量计位置、0.1°像素和1.0°像素处进行匹配。该研究证实了IMERG尽管设计为高分辨率降水产品，但仍具有分析气候趋势的潜力，这与大气环境遥感技术，特别是卫星观测和降水分析密切相关。,"['precipitation', 'climate trends', 'satellite observations', 'IMERG', 'GPM', 'TRMM', 'remote sensing', 'global precipitation measurement']",Siyu Zhu;Zhi Li;Mengye Chen;Yixin Wen;Zhong Liu;George J Huffman;Theresa E Tsoodle;Sebastian C Ferraro;Yuzhou Wang;Yang Hong,Evaluation of IMERG climate trends over land in the TRMM and GPM eras,"The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for global precipitation measurement (GPM) mission (IMERG) is a global precipitation product suite consisting of both near-real-time and research-grade products with high spatiotemporal resolution. However, the IMERG developers note that it is designed as a high resolution precipitation product (HRPP), not a Climate Data Record, and its ability to capture climate trends remains uncertain. Therefore, it is imperative to explore and quantify IMERG’s capability in capturing climate trends for our community. This study examines the climatological performance of IMERG Final (Version 06) by analyzing annual precipitation trends over land from 2001 to 2019 using the Mann-Kendall analysis, taking gauge records as ground truth. Three different matching strategies are applied: at gauge locations, at 0.1° pixels, and at 1.0° pixels. Additionally, this study compares the performances during the TRMM (2001–2014) and GPM eras (2015–2019). Our results find: (1) IMERG daily data exhibits high spatial consistency with gauge records at both gauge locations and 0.1° resolution, consistent with its Global Precipitation Climatology Centre calibration, with a conversion rate of approximately 89.3%; (2) IMERG performs much better overall in the GPM era than in the tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) era, evidenced by a lower proportion of unreliable samples (∼10.2% vs. ∼21.2%); (3) The proportion of samples showing consistent trends with gauge data is 86.7% in the GPM era, much higher than the 70.5% and 75.3% shown by the entire record and the TRMM era, respectively. This improvement in the GPM era suggests that the within-mission consistency of IMERG is higher than the between-mission consistency, likely due to residual differences in the calibration methods used during the TRMM and GPM missions. This study broadens the perspective on IMERG, showcasing its additional potential for analyzing climate trends despite its design only as a HRPP. Crucially, it highlights and reconfirms how the GPM era has enhanced IMERG’s capacity for accurately tracking global precipitation trends."

We present a framework combining economic models and remote-sensing data to spatially explicitly assess willingness-to-accept payments to irrigators and unit water-saving costs. Applied to three major tributary watersheds of the Great Salt Lake, this framework identifies areas with the highest conservation potential and cost-effectiveness. We find that an annual water conservation goal of 581 million m3, necessary to restore the lake within 30 years, can be met by fallowing irrigated alfalfa fields. With 95% certainty, this goal would be fully achieved with annual payments of US$325 million under site-specific payments or US$376 million under county-level payments, or at least 84% achieved with US$341 million under watershed-level payments.

Biochar is the most commonly sold form of CDR to date and it can be used in applications ranging from concrete to agricultural soil amendments. Previous analyses of biochar rely on modeled or estimated life-cycle data and suggest a cradle-to-gate range of 0.20–1.3 kg CO2 net removal per kg of biomass feedstock, with the range reported driven by differences in energy consumption, pyrolysis temperature, and feedstock sourcing. Herein, we quantify the distribution of CDR possible for biochar production with a compositional life-cycle inventory model paired with scenario-aware Monte Carlo simulation in a ‘best practice’ (incorporating lower transportation distances, high pyrolysis temperatures, high energy efficiency, recapture of energy for drying and pyrolysis energy requirements, and co-generation of heat and electricity) and ‘poor practice’ (higher transportation distances, lower pyrolysis temperatures, low energy efficiency, natural gas for energy requirements, and no energy recovery) scenarios. In the best-practice scenario, cradle-to-gate CDR (which is representative of the upper limit of removal across the entire life cycle) is highly certain, with a median removal of 1.4 kg of CO2e/kg biomass and results in net removal across the entire distribution. In contrast, the poor-practice scenario results in median net emissions of 0.090 kg CO2e/kg biomass. Whether this scenario emits (66% likelihood) or removes (34% likelihood) carbon dioxide is highly uncertain. The emission intensity of energy inputs to the pyrolysis process and whether the bio-oil co-product is used as a chemical feedstock or combusted are critical factors impacting the net carbon dioxide emissions of biochar production, together responsible for 98% of the difference between the best- and poor-practice scenarios."

However, research on SWI often fails to consider its impact on coastal agriculture. Linking georeferenced SWI data with cropland presence, this review examines SWI’s global distribution and primary drivers. Major attested hotspots include the Mediterranean, South and South-East Asia, and the Bohai Sea region in China. Approximately 87 Mha of cropland globally are vulnerable due to low elevation and coastal proximity, including regions where little to no literature has documented SWI. Main drivers include sea-level rise (SLR), drought, groundwater depletion, river modifications, tidal flooding and subsidence. Projections of SLR indicate cropland of North America, the Indian Subcontinent, and South-East Asia as high-risk for SWI. Additionally, regions like South-East Asia and the Indian Subcontinent are expected to experience significant demographic growth in coastal areas. Understanding present and future SWI dynamics is crucial for designing effective mitigation and adaptation strategies in coastal agriculture to support food supply."

Despite previous studies projecting warmer and dryer conditions for most of the territory, there is concern about the robustness (i.e. level of agreement among models) of changes projected for its magnitude, not only for the impact on climate indices across this domain but also to identify changes in the spatial distribution of climate classes. Hence, we statistically downscaled and bias-corrected daily CMIP6 model outputs for continental Chile, using a multivariate bias correction method, to project climate changes under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. The results reveal that General Circulation Models (GCMs) project increased dryness across the study domain by the end of the 21st century, especially in Central Chile (−30% in precipitation), with notable sensitivities of precipitation projections to the implementation of bias correction methods in the northern and austral macrozones. Temperature projections show less dispersion, with higher increments in northern Chile and the Andes (4 ∘C–5 ∘C). Notable shifts in the extension of Köppen–Geiger climate classes are projected for the next decades, with the expansion of deserts in northern Chile and the prevalence of temperate climates with dry summers in central Chile. The Andes subdomain is expected to face the most dramatic changes in Köppen–Geiger classes (inter-model agreement 70%). Surprisingly, despite the large spread in GCM projections, there is high agreement among models regarding spatial changes in climate classes. Additionally, our results project drastic reductions in snowfall across the Andes, with higher freezing level heights that may exacerbate flooding and landslide risk across the country."

This study utilizes global agricultural trade and sanctions data from 2000 to 2019 to empirically investigate the impact of sanctions and uncover its specific internal mechanisms. The findings reveal that sanctions have reduced the import dependency of sanctioned countries by about 6% on average. Notably, improving domestic production in sanctioned countries is instrumental in mitigating the adverse effects of sanctions on food security, but it increases the emissions of CH4, N2O, biomass burned and the use of fertilizer and pesticide, which destroys the domestic environmental sustainability. These results imply that reducing import dependency on external markets improves the ‘availability’ and ‘stability’ of food security without sacrificing ‘agency,’ but it exacerbates ‘access,’ ‘utilization,’ and ‘sustainability.’ These findings are significant for proactively addressing and alleviating the impact of sanctions on agricultural sustainable development."

Agricultural policies such as the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in the European Union (EU) stimulate more diverse crop-mixes. We compute a new EU-wide overview of crop diversification for 2018 using the Shannon diversity index based on 10 m resolution EO crop map. For the EU as a whole, the effective number of species broadly ranges from 2.6 (p10) to 5.3 (p90) with a median of 3.9. The EO-based map allows identifying how crop diversity varies at an informative spatial resolution, e.g. in areas dominated by mono-cropping or with extensive forest cover. Here we compare the crop diversity calculated from top–down EO-data and bottom–up farmers’ declarations in the Netherlands using the EO-based map (more than 84 millions 10 m pixels) and 2018 Dutch farmers declarations (more than 323 thousands parcels). After accounting for differences in thematic and spatial detail we show agreement in spatial patterns and calculated crop diversification (R2 = 0.62). Furthermore, we track changes in crop diversity over time using the Dutch farmers’ declarations from 2009 to 2021, which suggest a positive response to the 2014 CAP greening policy.

SRM complicates climate change governance because, in addition to advancing collective action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, governance needs to restrain unilateral SRM action while balancing diverging actor interests, ethical risks and scientific uncertainty. We survey international climate policy experts for their assessments of the potential for effective global governance of SRM and the likelihood of possible international responses to unilateral SRM scenarios. Experts are pessimistic about the global community achieving effective SRM governance, and they believe unilateral SRM action will trigger international responses and conflicts. Experts believe softer responses are most likely (e.g. diplomatic sanctions) but the potential for stronger responses, including military action, are non-trivial. Relative to the Global North, experts from the Global South are relatively more supportive of SRM, including the development of SRM, the inclusion of SRM in international negotiations, and the deployment of SRM in a climate emergency."

Fine-scale space-time indexed estimates are critical to a variety of environmental, ecological, and economic monitoring efforts.

Here we propose a spatio-temporal Bayesian small area estimation modeling framework that delivers statistically valid estimates with complete uncertainty quantification for status, trend, and change. The framework accommodates a variety of space and time dependency structures, and we detail model configurations for different settings. The proposed framework is used to quantify forest carbon dynamics at an annual county-level across a 14 year period for the contiguous United States.

To bridge this knowledge gap, we conducted a series of sensitivity numerical experiments with different SST configurations. The simulation results indicate that, over the lifespan of a PL, SSTA does not significantly influence PL intensity but does enhance latent heat release. On a longer time scale, based on simulations of five winter seasons over the Nordic Sea, we found that the accumulated impact of mesoscale SSTA creates favorable environments for PL intensification, characterized by higher moisture levels and lower static stability.

Our results indicate that this 0.5 ∘C increase in global warming triggers an intensified reaction in both the Arctic’s mean sea surface temperature (SST) and variability. In a 2 ∘C warmer world, one out of every four summer months would be warmer than the current climate. We detect a nonlinear increase of MHW intensity in a 2 ∘C world, which is characterized by a break in slope occurring around the year 2042 ± 2 (across 50 ensemble members of the SSP5-8.5 scenario). At the estimated post-break dates, the intensity rate roughly doubles, leading to MHWs in a 2 ∘C world with average cumulative heat intensity 100 ∘C*days higher than in a 1.5 ∘C world. Further results reveal that an extremely rare MHW with an intensity of 3.19 ∘C, classified as a 1-in-100-year event in a 1.5 ∘C world, is expected to transform into a 1-in-7-year event in a 2 ∘C world. This transition signifies a ∼15-fold increase in the likelihood of such events occurring due to a 0.5 ∘C increase in global warming. Likewise, a rare occurrence of years featuring 125 MHW days in a 1.5 ∘C world is projected to become a 1-in-10-year event in a 2 ∘C world, resulting in a 10-fold increase in occurrence probability. The main contributor to these changes is predominantly the rise in mean SST, with enhanced SST variability playing a minor role. These findings highlight that a 2 ∘C world could lead to a substantial escalation of the frequency and intensity of MHWs in the Arctic compared to a 1.5 ∘C world, transforming what are currently rare extreme events into more common events, with significant implications for global climate dynamics and the well-being of Arctic ecosystems and communities."

This approach is gaining momentum in international forums and among development practitioners focused on improving the sustainability and efficiency of their water security interventions. Following this trend, the integration of market incentives to foster the uptake of WSTs is not surprising. However, recent literature on WSTs and related incentives paints an ambiguous picture of the impact these technologies can have. On one hand, there is evidence that supports the efficacy of market incentives in promoting water-saving practices and the adoption of WSTs. On the other hand, there are also concerns about the potential adverse consequences of introducing WSTs, including promoting unsustainable water consumption and exacerbating inequalities. This study focuses on Mercy Corps’ water innovation technologies program in Jordan, a country grappling with severe water scarcity. It specifically examines how market mechanisms played a crucial role in saving approximately 24 million cubic meters of water, equivalent to around 9500 Olympic-sized swimming pools. Driven by this significant achievement, the study delves deeper into the efficacy of market-based approaches, while also considering their potential limitations. The conclusion offers a critical perspective on how the promotion of WSTs through market-based approaches can ensure that water savings contribute to both environmental sustainability and human well-being. In particular, Mercy Corps’ practitioner perspective advocates for governance reforms that limit and prevent unsustainable consumption, facilitate and ensure equitable access to WSTs, and promote the fair redistribution of water savings across different users."

Marine heatwaves (MHWs) would play a more destructive role than ocean warming during the interaction of pollutants and marine life. To evaluate the potential risks of TPs leachate under MHWs, the physiological and nutrient metabolic endpoints of microalgae Isochrysis galbana were observed for 7 days while being exposed to TPs leachate at current or predicted concentrations under MHWs. TPs leachate mainly contained Zn and 6-PPD, which could be absorbed by microalgae mostly, especially under MHWs. Additionally, TPs leachate increased the reactive oxygen species content, activated the antioxidant system, impaired photosynthesis and glycolysis, and decreased sugar and protein content. 10 mg/L TPs leachate increased the lipid content and saturation. Meanwhile, microalgae under such TPs leachate were biased toward the synthesis of long-chain fatty acids and Δ8 desaturation pathway. MHWs promoted the positive effects of TPs leachate on microalgae growth at the current concentration but exacerbated the negative effects at the predicted concentration. Our study emphasizes the potential risks of TPs leachate to marine primary production systems, especially if accompanied by the increasing intensity and frequency of extreme climate events."

However, the susceptibility of anammox bacteria to coexisting heavy metals considerably restricts their use in engineering practices. Here, we report that acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL), a signaling molecule that mediates quorum sensing (QS), significantly enhances the nitrogen removal rate by 24% under Cu2+ stress. A suite of macro-/microanalytical and bioinformatic analyses was exploited to unravel the underlying mechanisms of AHL-induced Cu2+ resistance. Macro-/microanalytical evidence indicated that AHL regulations on the production, spatial distribution, and functional groups of extracellular polymeric substances were not significant, ruling out extracellular partitioning and complexation as a principal mechanism. Meanwhile, molecular biological evidence showed that AHL upregulated the transcriptional levels of resistance genes (sod, kat, cysQ, and czcC responsible for antioxidation defense, Cu2+ sequestration, and transport) to appreciable extents, indicating intracellular resistance as the primary mechanism. This study yielded a mechanistic understanding of the regulatory roles of AHL in extracellular and intracellular resistance of anammox consortia, providing a fundamental basis for utilizing QS regulation for efficient nitrogen removal in wastewaters with heavy metal stress."

However, their impacts on soil biogeochemical processes remain unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of TWP at various doses and their leachate on soil respiration and denitrification using a robotized continuous-flow incubation system in upland soil. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry and high-throughput sequencing were employed to elucidate the mechanisms underpinning the TWP effects. We show that TWP increased soil CO2, N2, and N2O emissions, which were attributed to the changes in content and composition of soil dissolved organic matter (DOM) induced by TWP and their leachate. Specifically, the labile DOM components (H/C ≥ 1.5 and transformation >10), which were crucial in shaping the denitrifying community, were significantly enriched by TWP exposure. Furthermore, the abundances of denitrification genes (nirK/S and nosZ-I) and the specific denitrifying genera Pseudomonas were increased following TWP exposure.

We comprehensively elucidate the intricate process of subgenomic collaboration and divergence across various tissues. A comparison among subgenomes in the 12 tissues reveals widespread differences in the reorganization of 3D genome structures, with the Dt subgenome exhibiting a higher extent of dynamic chromatin status than the At subgenome. Moreover, we construct a comprehensive atlas of putative functional genome elements and discover that 37 cis-regulatory elements (CREs) have selection signals acquired during domestication and improvement. These data and analyses are publicly available to the research community through a web portal. In summary, this study provides abundant resources and depicts the regulatory architecture of the genome, which thereby facilitates the understanding of biological processes and guides cotton breeding. This study describes comprehensive dynamic divergence of subgenomes in allotetraploid cotton, with an focus on cis-regulatory elements and 3D genomic architecture at 12 major tissues/developmental stages throughout the life cycle."

This study shows that the duration coding of brief visual events transforms along the human cortical hierarchy, and that duration and spatial processing interact through common neural responses and linked topographic representations. 
 Integrating spatial and temporal information is essential for our sensory experience. While psychophysical evidence suggests spatial dependencies in duration perception, few studies have directly tested the neural link between temporal and spatial processing. Using ultra-high-field functional MRI and neuronal-based modeling, we investigated how and where the processing and the representation of a visual stimulus duration is linked to that of its spatial location. Our results show a transition in duration coding: from monotonic and spatially-dependent in early visual cortex to unimodal and spatially-invariant in frontal cortex. Along the dorsal visual stream, particularly in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), neuronal populations show common selective responses to both spatial and temporal information. In the IPS, spatial and temporal topographic organizations are also linked, although duration maps are smaller, less clustered, and more variable across participants. These findings help identify the mechanisms underlying human perception of visual duration and characterize the functional link between time and space processing, highlighting the importance of their interactions in shaping brain responses. Common organizational principles of spatial and temporal information processing are not fully understood.

 Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has become a standard anti-cancer treatment, offering durable clinical benefits. However, the limited response rate of ICB necessitates biomarkers to predict and modulate the efficacy of the therapy. The gut microbiome’s influence on ICB efficacy is of particular interest due to its modifiability through various interventions. However, gut microbiome biomarkers for ICB response have been inconsistent across different studies. Here, we identify TANB77, an uncultured and distinct bacterial clade, as the most consistent responder-enriched taxon through meta-analysis of ten independent ICB recipient cohorts. Traditional taxonomy fails to distinguish TANB77 from unrelated taxa, leading to its oversight. Mice with higher gut TANB77 abundance, either naturally or through transplantation, show improved response to anti-PD-1 therapy. Additionally, mice injected with TANB77-derived pilin-like protein exhibit improved anti-PD-1 therapy response, providing in vivo evidence for the beneficial role of the pilin-like protein. These findings suggest that pilins from the TANB77 order may enhance responses to ICB therapy across diverse cohorts of cancer patients.

 We describe a structural and functional study of the G protein-coupled apelin receptor, which binds two endogenous peptide ligands, apelin and Elabela/Toddler (ELA), to regulate cardiovascular development and function. Characterisation of naturally occurring apelin receptor variants from the UK Genomics England 100,000 Genomes Project, and AlphaFold2 modelling, identifies T892.64 as important in the ELA binding site, and R1684.64 as forming extensive interactions with the C-termini of both peptides. Base editing to introduce an R/H1684.64 variant into human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes demonstrates that this residue is critical for receptor binding and function. Additionally, we present an apelin receptor crystal structure bound to the G protein-biased, small molecule agonist, CMF-019, which reveals a deeper binding mode versus the endogenous peptides at lipophilic pockets between transmembrane helices associated with GPCR activation.

 Plants accumulate silicon to protect them from biotic and abiotic stresses. Especially in rice (Oryza sativa), a typical Si-accumulator, tremendous Si accumulation is indispensable for healthy growth and productivity. Here, we report a shoot-expressed signaling protein, Shoot-Silicon-Signal (SSS), an exceptional homolog of the flowering hormone “florigen” differentiated in Poaceae. SSS transcript is only detected in the shoot, whereas the SSS protein is also detected in the root and phloem sap. When Si is supplied from the root, the SSS transcript rapidly decreases, and then the SSS protein disappears. In sss mutants, root Si uptake and expression of Si transporters are decreased to a basal level regardless of the Si supply. The grain yield of the mutants is decreased to 1/3 due to insufficient Si accumulation. Thus, SSS is a key phloem-mobile protein for integrating root Si uptake and shoot Si accumulation underlying the terrestrial adaptation strategy of grasses.

 The powerful thermal driving force of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) exerts a significant influence on weather, climate, and environmental processes in Asia and across the globe. This paper investigates the causes of climate change on the QTP from the perspective of global atmospheric energy transport and water cycle. During summer, a “hollow energy pool” has been discovered in the troposphere, with its energy center located above the QTP, the “Asian water tower”. Our study indicates that the QTP serves as a critical “window” for the global transport of water vapor and energy. Since 1991, the total atmospheric energy (TAE) and precipitation in the warming-wetting region of the QTP (central and northern plateau) have exhibited interdecadal growth. Furthermore, the TAE of the plateau is closely linked to the TAE and water vapor of oceans at mid-low latitudes, and even in the southern hemisphere, the increased precipitation in the warming-wetting region of the plateau has been mainly regulated by the atmospheric energy and water vapor transport structures over the equatorial western Pacific, southwestern Pacific, and southern Indian Ocean, we further reveal the energy transport channel from the warming oceanic areas of the southern and northern hemispheres to the QTP.

 Two robust peaks in the diurnal evolution of orographically-locked precipitation are simulated in large-eddy simulations with an idealized ocean-plain-mountain topography. The ensemble experiment design is guided by sounding statistics from summertime afternoon thunderstorms in Taiwan to obtain realistic variability of free-tropospheric moisture associated with the intensity of the summertime subtropical high. The convection in the first peak is directly modulated by convective available potential energy, while the convection in the second peak is associated with low-level moist static energy (MSE) transport by the island-scale (40-km) local circulation, producing more extreme rainfall. When the initial free troposphere is drier, the convection in the second peak is strengthened. Both the environmental adjustments by the first peak and local circulation development contribute to the sensitivity of the second peak to free-tropospheric moisture. This work highlights the critical roles of convection-environment interaction and upstream MSE supply in enhancing extreme diurnal precipitation over complex topography."

 Peatlands store vast amounts of carbon, with deep peat carbon remaining stable due to limited thermodynamic energy and transport. However, climate change-induced increases in labile carbon inputs could destabilize these stores. Here, we combined DNA stable isotope probing with stable isotope-assisted metabolomics employing a multi-platform approach to investigate microbial dynamics driving deep peat carbon degradation upon labile carbon (e.g., glucose) amendment. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of deep peat carbon, as glucose addition triggers the breakdown of older organic matter. By uniquely integrating these techniques, we identified active glucose metabolizers to specific microbial populations and mapped carbon flow through microbial networks, elucidating their role in priming recalcitrant carbon mineralization. This multi-omics approach offers crucial insights into how changing resources reshape the peatland microbiome, enhancing our understanding of deep carbon processing, and refining model parameterization to predict microbial responses and carbon cycle feedbacks under global change pressures.

 Around the periphery of the Greenland ice sheet, satellite-based observations of ground uplift record Earth’s response to past and recent unloading of Greenland’s ice mass. On the southeast coast, near the Kangerlussuaq glacier, rapid uplift exceeding 12 mm/yr cannot be explained using current layered Earth deformation models. Here we find that 3D models with a weakened Earth structure, consistent with the passage of Greenland over the Iceland plume, can explain the rapid uplift of Southeast Greenland. This uplift is dominated by a viscous response that is accelerated by the low viscosities of the hot plume track. Recent mass loss, occurring during the last millennium and especially within the past few decades, drives most of the uplift. Holocene indicators recorded similarly rapid uplift following deglaciation that ended the last ice age. Such rapid uplift, occurring beneath marine terminating glaciers, can affect the future stability of entire ice catchment areas and will become increasingly important in the near future as deglaciation accelerates.

 Mountain systems significantly influence both regional and global climates, and are vital for biodiversity, water resources, and economic activities. Many mountainous regions are experiencing more rapid temperature changes than environments at lower elevations. Whilst in situ weather stations offer critical data on near-surface air temperature (Tair) patterns, the lack of high-elevation stations may lead to an underestimation of warming in mountainous regions. Land surface temperature (LST), which has a strong relationship with Tair and can potentially be measured globally by satellites irrespective of extreme terrain, presents an important alternative for comprehensively assessing temperature dynamics. In this study, we review studies on the relationship between satellite-derived LST and in situ Tair, particularly in mountainous regions, by conducting a meta-analysis of the research literature and discussing the factors driving the LST-Tair relationship. Our review reveals several research biases, including the regions that are the focus of studies to date (e.g. hemispheric and continent biases) and the elevation ranges that have in situ Tair data.

 Extending satellite radar altimetry measurements from the open ocean to the coastal zone can improve the accuracy and quality of monitoring coastal sea level. However, radar altimetry waveforms can be distorted by any inhomogeneity in the properties of the surface observed within the footprints, possibly leading to range measurement errors. To address these issues, a coastal retracking method based on reconstructed sea surface height and iterative threshold (RSIT) is proposed in this paper. RSIT involves several steps: First, the sea surface height components are reconstructed as prior information to compute the initial retracking gate. Next, iterate the amplitude scale factor of the entire waveform to identify possible sub-waveforms. After each iteration, continuity between neighboring sub-waveforms is assessed. Eventually, the optimal retracking gate is determined from all identified sub-waveforms. We validated RSIT using Jason-2 data in the coastal regions of Australia and Pakistan. Experimental results show that RSIT can retrieve more available altimetry data and enhance the accuracy by nearly 37.5% and 23.1% compared to ALES within the last few kilometers to the coast, respectively. Moreover, the impact of varied errors in reconstructed sea surface height on RSIT was discussed, with the results reveal that RSIT has strong robustness to errors within 1 m, making it suitable for application in most coastal zones."

 The pre-processing feasibility assessment of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is important for predicting the quality of InSAR results and guiding the further accurate slope displacement monitoring. However, such kinds of pre-processing (i.e. before the interferometry data processing) assessment method are few, especially for the slope displacement in wide areas. In this article, a method for assessing the pre-processing feasibility of InSAR displacement monitoring is proposed, which mainly takes into accounts the maximum detectable deformation gradients (MDDG), SAR geometric distortions and vegetation coverage. Based on the above factors, the classification criteria employed for InSAR feasibility assessment are built. The approach is applied over Guangxi Province, China a landslide prone area, and an InSAR feasibility map categorized into four categories: high, moderate, low, and very low over the entire study area for pre-processing analysis is obtained. The feasibility results indicate that approximately 77% of areas are classified as very low in the four categories, while the high and moderate feasibility are mainly distributed in urban areas and regions with a NDVI value of less than 0.5.

 The biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA) was quantified and characterized during a period of elevated emissions from residential heating at a Mediterranean urban area. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) of the measurements from a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) indicated that biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA) was the dominant organic aerosol (OA) component during this period accounting for 52% of the total OA with the rest of the sources being traffic (10%), cooking (13%) and oxygenated OA (OOA 24%). One fourth (25%) of the BBOA had undergone chemical aging and was identified as aged BBOA. Organonitrates correlated highly with this aged BBOA factor. Reactions of the biomass burning emissions with nitrate radicals during nighttime appeared to be the major source of aged BBOA. Our findings strongly suggest that the BBOA estimated from AMS factor analyses in urban environments during the winter is a lower limit of the biomass burning contribution to OA. A significant fraction of the OA from biomass burning is included in the OOA factor. The average PM2.5 oxidative potential (DTTm) measured during the campaign was 14 ± 4.5 pmol min−1 μg−1, elevated during periods when BBOA chemical aging was favorable."

 The rapid growth in population and urban development has attracted considerable scientific attention due to its impact on the local and regional atmospheric environment. Given its scientific significance, in this study, we employ the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to investigate the physical mechanisms underlying the impact of Land Use Land Cover (LULC) changes on the fog life cycle of a recent dense fog episode in January 2021. The model domain covers the Delhi National Capital Region (NCR) at a resolution of 2 km. We conducted two sensitivity experiments: The control run (CNTL), representing the current LULC, and the Experimental run (EXP), by integrating the land use conditions from 2004. Results from these experiments suggest that the model reasonably reproduces the near-surface meteorological conditions and vertical profiles during the severe fog episode. Over the past two decades, urban and built-up areas and dryland croplands increased by 119.73% and 118.97%, most of which were converted from irrigated croplands and other vegetated areas. We noticed that the increase in urban areas has led to an advancement in fog dissipation by about 1–2 h. The early dissipation also results in modifying the Liquid Water Path (LWP), consequently forming fog holes. Moreover, this phenomenon is likely to escalate if urban areas continue to develop in the future. We further attribute the near-surface soil moisture as a primary factor influencing the early lifting and dissipation of the fog layer by affecting surface fluxes (quantified by Bowen Ratio (BR)) and Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE), and expediting the heating (0.5°C–2°C) and drying (5%–20%) of the near-surface boundary layer (<500m from the land surface)."

 Brown carbon (BrC) plays a crucial role in atmospheric radiation and global climate. Secondary brown carbon (SBrC) generated through various oxidation pathways from primary organic aerosols (POA), gas-to-particle conversion, and multiphase reactions of gas-phase precursors, is an important contributor to BrC. Most research has focused on individual formation pathways of SBrC in the laboratory, whereas little is known about its common feature in the atmosphere. Here we demonstrate that the semi-solid phase of aerosol particles when aerosol water content (AWC) is less than 15 μg/m3 facilitates the formation of SBrC in the atmosphere based on comprehensive observations from 2020 to 2022 in Beijing and experimental simulations. Field observations show that the fraction of SBrC (fSBrC) in the semi-solid phase (0.35 ± 0.20) is significantly (at 0.01 level) higher than that in the liquid phase (0.29 ± 0.19), accompanied by a larger ratio of the fraction of more-oxidized organic aerosol (MO-OOA) to less-oxidized organic aerosol (LO-OOA) (fMO-OOA/fLO-OOA) associated with the semi-solid phase than the counterpart, while the SBrC in both cases has a comparable Absorption Ångström exponent (4.45 ± 2.07). Laboratory study demonstrates that SBrC is produced at a faster rate from heterogeneous reactions between glyoxal and NH4HSO4 in the semi-solid phase simulated at 0.38 relative humidity (RH) than in the liquid phase simulated at 0.70 RH. The higher ionic strength in the semi-solid phase drives the faster formation rate of SBrC, supported by a positive correlation between the light absorption of SBrC and the ionic strength."

 Pristine Himalayan environment is being increasingly affected by the exogenous pollutants which are often observed over mountains. This study, for the first time, elucidates upon the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the concentrations of primary and secondary aerosols along with associated dynamics, across the boundaries of two regions with very different geographical features. PM2.5 measurements from northern Indian atmosphere during three distinct phases (P-I, P-II, P-III) of 2020, were investigated against previous three year's mean (2017–2019) over Delhi/NCR (DN) in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and Nainital (NT) in the Central Himalaya (CH) using integrated ground based, spaceborne and reanalysis datasets. Strict lockdown measures led to a substantial reduction in PM2.5 levels in north India, with ∼62% decrease in DN and a minor ∼8% in NT region, for a couple of weeks, along with decrease in other primary absorbing aerosols (BC, OC and dust), conversely, an enhancement was observed in the scattering aerosol (SO42−). Vertical profiles of Extinction Coefficient from CALIPSO satellite revealed substantial reductions (∼60%) in aerosol content across 0–6 km, over study region with a larger decline in the foothills. Particulate depolarization ratio (PDR) and Particulate color ratio (PCR) declined with altitude by 44% and 31% respectively due to prevalence of fine particles over CH and irregular shapes near the surface (DN). In P-II, aerosol subtype occurrences changed significantly above boundary layer (2–4 km) and reduction in primary aerosols did not contribute to reducing PM2.5 concentrations. P-III exhibited enhanced secondary particle formation exacerbated by Stratosphere-Troposphere Exchange (STE) events of O3 that increased the oxidizing capacity in atmosphere. Overall, an upsurge in SO42− and HNO3, was observed in CH and DN region respectively. These findings highlight the significance of secondary aerosols in reduced primary emissions and need of comprehensive case study employing box and regional chemistry models."

 Efforts to reduce particulate matter (PM) mass concentrations often overlook the variability in PM components and associated health effects across cities. Here, we conducted PM toxicity experiments by injecting 228 Wistar rats with water-soluble PM suspensions (filtered through 0.45 μm membrane) (PMSF) of equal mass (6 mg/kg body weight), collected from automobile air filter in 31 major Chinese cities. Results revealed that PMs from thirty-one sources resulted in statistically significant differences in organ damages (heart, lung and liver), protein biomarkers and four microRNA expressions (miR-21, miR-125b, miR-146a, and miR-155). Nonetheless, these same measurements exhibited a statistical similarity for neighboring cities. Dimensionality reduction and machine learning algorithm revealed a strong link between specific metal components in PMSF and PM-related health risks. For example, reducing 6.20% of metal elements in PMSF was estimated to result in a 23.74% reduction in health risk. Additionally, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) levels per unit PM mass was also observed to vary substantially across the 31 cities, thus further explaining the health disparity. Until this work, most studies involve limited number of city PM sources, thus developing a biased understanding of PM toxicity and health impacts for a country or the world. The results here provide a state-of-the-art mechanistic understanding of the health effects of PMs of diverse city sources, while formulating the theoretical basis and reference for city- and component-specific PM control."

 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and nitrogen-containing aromatic compounds (NACs) are pivotal chromophores in the light-absorbing component of organic carbon, specifically brown carbon (BrC). This study delves into the light absorption properties of 16 PAHs and 8 NACs, determining their mass absorption efficiency (MAE). Focusing on Nanchang, China, we conducted a case study from March to April 2023, examining the PM2.5's light absorption contribution, from these chromophores. Notably, Benzo[g,h,i]perylene exhibited the highest MAE at 365 nm, with values reaching 53.9 m2/g and 5-Nitrosalicylic acid at 70.7 m2/g. Our findings supplement the MAE across most PAH and NAC monomers with methanol as a solvent at 365 nm and average MAE at 300–500 nm. In Nanchang, methanol-soluble organic carbon (MSOC) demonstrated distinct light absorption coefficients on hazy versus clean days, 3.48 Mm⁻1 and 2.71 Mm⁻1 respectively, suggesting that secondary BrC formation or aging processes augment light absorption on hazy days. The Ångström exponent (AAEMSOC) of 4.85 for MSOC underscores the influence of a variety of regional pollutants and the diversity of chromophores formed through aging processes. MAEMSOC,365 was higher on clean days (3.23 m2 g−1) compared to hazy days (1.53 m2 g−1), likely attributable to MSOC's increased concentration during haze events. The light absorption contribution of PAHs at 365 nm accounted for 9.20 %, substantially exceeding their mass contribution by a factor of approximately 5.2, underscoring their dominant role. In contrast, NACs, at 2.68%, surpassed their mass contribution by a factor of 1.9, indicating a substantial yet lesser impact. This study accentuates the substantial influence of PAHs as chromophores in regional carbonaceous aerosols."

 The first comprehensive long-term observation of the variability in columnar aerosol optical depth (AOD) and ambient Black Carbon mass concentrations (MB) was conducted at a tropical coastal location neighboring the Arabian Sea (Goa; 15.45°N, 73.83°E) between December and May in two phases: 2008–2011 (Phase I) and 2017–2021 (Phase II). Inter-seasonal (winter monsoon season (WMS): December–February; spring inter-monsoon season (SIMS): March–April; and MAY) and interphase variability in aerosol types, potential source regions, aerosol direct radiative effects (ADRE), and heating rate (HR) were investigated. The slope of spectral AOD was steeper during WMS and SIMS than MAY in both phases. Relatively flat AOD spectra with low Ångström exponent (α < 1) prevailed during all seasons in Phase I and MAY in Phase II, implying the predominance of coarse-mode aerosols. However, increasing fine-mode aerosol dominance was observed during WMS and SIMS in Phase II (mean α ∼1.5). The highest and lowest mean MB were recorded during WMS of Phase I (2904.68 ± 787.20 ng m−3), and MAY of Phase II (531.12 ± 163.95 ng m−3), respectively. Further, urban/industrial aerosols increased over 3-fold during WMS and SIMS from Phase I to Phase II. Strong potential sources of fine-mode aerosols were interspersed across the Deccan Plateau, central India, and the east coast of India during WMS of Phase II. An investigation into the sources showed that the enhancement in power generation capacities of thermal power plants was a major contributor to fine-mode anthropogenic aerosols, along with increased vehicular density and agricultural activity at upwind locations in Phase II. The sharp rise in single scattering albedo (SSA) in Phase II implied a substantial increase in scattering aerosols. ADRE in the atmosphere (ADREATM) and HR were the highest during SIMS (63.76 ± 12.99 W m−2; 1.79 ± 0.36 K day−1) in Phase I. Low ADREATM and HR were recorded during SIMS (28.20 ± 13.84 W m−2; 0.79 ± 0.39 K day−1) and MAY (36.15 ± 9.15 W m−2; 1.06 ± 0.31 K day−1) in Phase II, which can be attributed to the rapid decline in absorbing aerosols during SIMS and MAY of 2020 and 2021, coinciding with the countrywide COVID-19 lockdown."

 As a serious compound disaster, the drought-flood abrupt alternation (DFAA) has become consensus and is urgent to be analyzed. Previous studies have mainly focused on the monthly time scale, making it difficult to reveal the detailed variation characteristics of DFAA. To address this limitation, this study proposed a daily-scale method that combines narrow and generalized DFAA intensity to identify, screen, and evaluate DFAA phenomena. Taking the Pearl River Basin (PRB) as an example, the results obtained through the new method demonstrate good agreement with the observed reality. The DFAA events mainly occurred in the west, east and southeast of PRB, and their frequency, coverage, intensity and average duration exhibit a significant upward trend, while the maximum duration shows an insignificant downward trend. Generally, the proposed method offers a clear representation of the evolution of DFAA events, and enables comprehensive analysis and comparison of DFAA events within the same watershed, thereby promoting a deeper understanding of DFAA on a broader temporal scale."

 This study proposed a new method to retrieve aerosol single scattering albedo (SSA) over land for the Medium Resolution Spectral Imager-II (MERSI-II) onboard the Fengyun-3D (FY-3D). Considering both accuracy and retrieval efficiency, the method combines machine learning with an aerosol optical model constructed from mixed aerosol components. A sample dataset, containing 4 bands of apparent reflectance simulated by the radiative transfer model and corresponding geometric conditions, aerosol and land surface information, is constructed for training and validating machine learning models. Three Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) SSA retrieval models are built based on the theoretical basis of SSA retrieval, and the sensitivity of SSA retrieval accuracy to input parameter errors is analyzed. The results show that BPNN-based SSA retrieval models can replace the iterative optimal solution process to a certain extent, achieving quick retrieval of satellite SSA. The BPNN SSA retrieval models are applied to FY-3D MERSI-II observations and validated using AERONET SSA products. The results indicate that the BPNN SSA retrieval model, which uses solar zenith angle, satellite zenith angle, relative azimuth angle, aerosol optical depth (AOD), surface altitude, bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) parameters (bands 1–2), and apparent reflectance (bands 1–4) as inputs, performs better than others. The retrievals show good consistency with AERONET SSA products with a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.5 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.045 (0.034) at 470 nm (550 nm). In addition, more than 66 % of the SSA retrievals are within the expected error of ±0.05."
