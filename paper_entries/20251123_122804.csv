This study presents an integrated framework combining process-based modeling (PBM), machine learning, and life cycle assessment (LCA) into a user-friendly decision support system (DSS) for AFS analysis and optimization. Multi-scenario simulations using Hi-sAFe (16 configurations varying in latitude and orientation) for maize–poplar systems produced detailed outputs, including land equivalent ratios (LER up to 1.29), crop yield (ranging from 4.3 to 8.1 t ha−1), and N2O emissions (1.6–9.4 kg N ha−1). We trained Random Forest models on PBM diagnostics, microclimate, and design covariates; post-hoc SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) identified maximum air temperature (Tmax), distance to tree rows, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) as the dominant predictors of yield and LER. To address data gaps, long short-term memory (LSTM) and TrAdaBoost-LSTM models were used for microclimate forecasting, achieving high fidelity (R2 = 0.88) in capturing hourly temperature and humidity trends. Outputs have been integrated into an LCA workflow, producing CO2-equivalent and nitrogen footprint metrics that feed into a functional web-based DSS. This platform enables robust, transparent, and scalable AFS evaluation, supporting stakeholders with real-time scenario exploration and scientifically grounded decision-making tools. Furthermore, the framework enables greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting in AFSs by integrating modeled soil organic carbon dynamics and N2O emissions. A Germany-wide assessment illustrates the significant GHG reduction potential achievable through large-scale implementation of AFSs."

However, large uncertainties remain in estimating its flux (Rs) and its temperature sensitivity (Q10) globally, and interactive effects from soil properties are often overlooked in models. To better predict global Rs and Q10, we applied four nonlinear models (Random forest (RF), AdaBoosted, Bagged Tree, and XGBoost models) to 3325 observations of Rs and Q10 from 1971 to 2023 with 18 predictors and used SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis to explore the interactive effects. The RF model provided the best performance, with the highest R2 values and minimal root mean squared errors. The results indicated that the global average annual Rs was 98.4 ± 19.4 Pg C. Excluding the effects of soil variables (soil texture (Stex), microbial composition, and solution chemistry) led to a decline in R2 (from 0.79 to 0.7 for Rs models and from 0.40 to 0.34 for Q10 models) and an underestimation on Rs. The results of rotated principal component analysis showed that these soil variables collectively explained 50% of the cumulative variance in Rs variability. Soil variables significantly constrained Q10 values, especially in nutrient-poor soils. SHAP analysis showed that the interactive effects of high soil sand proportion and high soil fertility may suppress Rs. High soil evapotranspiration may also decrease Rs at the extreme conditions of Stex. These findings highlight the underappreciated mechanistic influence of soil properties in Earth system models and underscore the need to incorporate multivariate interactions when modeling future soil respiration and its feedbacks to global change."
10.5194/acp-25-16387-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了GEOS-Chem化学传输模型对大气中氧化汞的低估问题。论文通过将模型输出与美国科罗拉多州山顶站点的实际测量数据进行对比，发现该模型无法准确重现观测到的氧化汞浓度，即使在模型中增强了氧化速率的情况下也是如此。研究结果表明，GEOS-Chem模型不仅低估了净汞氧化，还高估了氧化汞的沉降。这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它涉及大气成分分析和空气质量监测，并使用模型来模拟和预测大气中污染物的分布和变化。,"['atmospheric oxidized mercury', 'GEOS-Chem model', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis']",Tyler R.

Lyman,Underestimation of atmospheric oxidized mercury at a mountaintop site by the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model,"We compare verified atmospheric mercury measurements against output from the GEOS-Chem photochemical transport model. We show the model is unable to reproduce measured atmospheric oxidized mercury concentrations, even in several cases where oxidation rates in the model are enhanced. 
 An improved mechanistic model of mercury redox chemistry has recently been implemented in the GEOS-Chem model. In this study, GEOS-Chem simulations were compared to ambient measurements made during a high-oxidized mercury episode that originated in the free troposphere at a mountaintop site in Colorado, USA (40.455° N, −106.744° W, 3220 m above sea level). Measurements were collected with a dual channel atmospheric oxidized mercury measurement system that has been shown to accurately quantify oxidized mercury compounds in ambient air. The model and observations showed similar temporal trends for elemental and oxidized mercury (R2 of 0.54 to 0.79) and similar elemental mercury concentrations (normalized mean square error of 0.04 in the base model). However, the base model only produced 17 % of the maximum oxidized mercury observed in the dual channel system. In sensitivity tests with increased oxidation rates, the model still only produced, at most, 23 % of maximum observed oxidized mercury. In addition to underestimating net mercury oxidation, an analysis of elemental to oxidized mercury slopes indicated the model overestimated oxidized mercury deposition. An analysis of GEOS-Chem results from a separate study confirmed that while GEOS-Chem is able to simulate the range of measured oxidized mercury in low-oxidized mercury episodes and locations it consistently underestimates measured values during high-oxidized mercury periods at surface locations in western USA."
10.5194/acp-25-16411-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了对流尾迹（飞机尾气形成的冰云）的建模偏差问题，这些偏差与北大西洋的温带气旋有关。论文指出，气象模型在预测冰超饱和区域（ISSRs）的出现方面存在不足，这限制了对流尾迹的建模。研究重点关注了ERA5再分析数据，揭示了ISSRs的结构受到这些气旋系统的影响，特别是在干侵入和暖输送带区域。论文还评估了模型在不同区域的ISSRs预测性能，并探讨了湿度缩放方法对改善预测的潜力。总的来说，这项研究旨在提高ISSRs的预测能力，从而更好地评估和减轻航空对气候的影响。,"['contrails', 'ice supersaturation', 'extratropical depressions', 'climate warming', 'ERA5 reanalysis', 'humidity', 'aviation impact', 'synoptic weather situation']",Oliver G. A. Driver;Marc E. J. Stettler;Edward Gryspeerdt,The ice supersaturation biases limiting contrail modelling are structured around extratropical depressions,"Contrails are ice clouds caused by planes. They have a warming effect, so are important to model. In humid (ice supersaturated) regions, ice crystals are stable so can persist. However, weather model data doesn't represent ice supersaturated regions well enough. We demonstrate that ice supersaturation modelling is structured by North Atlantic storm systems. Averaging many systems, we link the bias to underling processes being modelled, and gain insight into how the existing data could be used. 
 Contrails are ice clouds formed along aircraft flight tracks, responsible for much of aviation's climate warming impact. Ice-supersaturated regions (ISSRs) provide conditions where contrail ice crystals can persist, but meteorological models often mispredict their occurrence, limiting contrail modelling. This deficiency is often treated by applying local humidity corrections. However, model performance is also affected by synoptic conditions (such as extratropical depressions).Here, composites of ERA5 reanalysis data around North Atlantic extratropical depressions enable a link between their structure and ISSR modelling. ISSRs are structured by these systems: at flight levels, ISSRs occur less frequently in the dry intrusion – descending upper-tropospheric air – than above warm conveyors – where air is lifted.  Both ERA5 reanalysis and in situ aircraft observations show this contrast, demonstrating that the model reproduces the fundamental relationship.  Individual-ISSR modelling performance (quantified using interpretable metrics) is also structured.  Of the rare ISSRs diagnosed in the location associated with the dry intrusion, fewer are confirmed by in situ observations (20 %–25 % precision drop compared to the warm conveyor) and fewer of those observed were diagnosed (13 %–19 % recall drop).  Scaling humidity beyond the occurrence rate bias dramatically increases the recall at low precision cost, demonstrating the potential value of scaling approaches designed with different intentions.  However, the failure of scaling to improve precision, or the performance in the dry intrusion, implies that there is a need to account for the synoptic weather situation and structure in order to improve ISSR forecasts in support of mitigating aviation's climate impact."

Diamond;Lili F. Boss,Conflict-induced ship traffic disruptions constrain cloud sensitivity to stricter marine pollution regulations,"Militia attacks on ships in the Red Sea disrupted container ship traffic in 2024. We use these traffic changes to quantify how the cloud-altering properties of ship pollution decreased following sulfur regulations in 2020 with measurements of two types of ship pollution, one of which is sensitive to fuel composition and another which is not. Near Africa, cloud changes in 2024 were nearly as large as before the regulations, but only one-third as strong after accounting for increased traffic. 
 Starting in November 2023, the Houthi militia occupying northwestern Yemen has attacked ships passing through the Bab al-Mandab Strait, a chokepoint on the Europe-Asia route via the Suez Canal. Cargo ship traffic through the Red Sea has since plummeted, with ships instead taking the longer route around the Cape of Good Hope. The increase in traffic in the southeastern Atlantic Ocean is readily apparent in satellite retrievals of nitrogen dioxide. Within the stratocumulus deck covering much of the southeastern Atlantic, a previously detectible cloud microphysical perturbation due to ship pollution had largely disappeared following the International Maritime Organization's sulfur-limiting regulations in 2020 but returns during 2024 due to the increase in ship traffic despite the lower cloud brightening efficacy per ship. Because nitrogen dioxide pollution per unit of fuel oil burned is not affected by switching to low-sulfur fuel, quantifying the ratio of shipping-enhanced cloud droplet number and nitrogen dioxide concentrations before and after the fuel sulfur limits went into effect provides a constraint on the cloud changes from the regulations. We find that the ∼ 80 % reduction in sulfur emissions leads to a ∼ 67 % reduction in the increase in cloud droplet number concentration per unit marine fuel oil burned."
10.5194/acp-25-16435-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了萜品烯（一种与柠檬烯同分异构体）在OH自由基和NO3自由基作用下的氧化机制，重点关注了含氮氧化有机分子（RONO2 OOMs）的形成及其对二次有机气溶胶（SOA）生成的影响。研究通过化学模型模拟了不同大气条件下OOMs的生成过程和产率，发现NO3自由基驱动的氧化反应中，通过键断裂转移自由基中心引发的新一轮自氧化是高产率RONO2 OOMs形成的关键。由于RONO2 OOMs具有较低的有效饱和浓度，更容易进入颗粒相，从而影响大气颗粒物的组成和空气质量。因此，该研究对于理解大气中有机物的转化过程、识别大气中的OOMs分子结构以及改进大气化学模型具有重要意义，并与大气环境遥感技术中的空气质量监测和大气成分分析密切相关。,"['secondary organic aerosol (SOA)', 'oxygenated organic molecules (OOMs)', 'terpinolene oxidation', 'OH oxidation', 'NO3 oxidation', 'organic nitrate (RONO2)', 'atmospheric composition', 'air quality monitoring']",Hongjin Wu;Juan Dang;Xiaomeng Zhang;Weichen Yang;Shuai Tian;Shibo Zhang;Qingzhu Zhang;Wenxing Wang,Key Role of Nitrogen-containing Oxygenated Organic Molecules (OOMs) in SOA Formation Evidenced by OH/NO3-induced Terpinolene Oxidation,"Terpinolene is an isomeride of limonene, with a high secondary organic aerosol (SOA) yield. The comparative analysis of OH-initiated (daytime) and NO3-driven (nocturnal) terpinolene oxidation mechanism, highlighted the formation of nitrogen-containing oxygenated organic molecules (OOMs), would be conducive to molecular structures identification of OOMs in atmospheric monitoring and atmospheric chemical model refinement. 
 Oxygenated organic molecules (OOMs), generated from the oxidation of various biogenic volatile organics with diverse yields, are a great contributor to SOA formation. Terpinolene is an isomeride of limonene, with a high SOA yield. Herein, we investigated the elaborate oxidation mechanism of terpinolene by OH and NO3, elucidating the new formation mechanism of OOMs and their yield profiles based on the newly-built zero-dimensional chemical model under three typical atmospheric conditions. For terpinolene oxidation by OH, H shift imposes restrictions on continuous autoxidation, instead by the reactions with HO2/NO/NO2 resulting in chain termination. For the reaction of terpinolene with NO3, the transfer of the radical center via bond breaking, triggering a new round of autoxidation, is newly found to be pivotal in the formation of organic nitrate (RONO2) OOMs with high yields. The effective saturation concentration (C∗) of RONO2 OOMs is mostly lower than the OOMs formed by OH oxidation, more easily distributed into the particle phase. The estimated C∗ of the generated OOMs is distinctly varied among OOM isomers, which emphasizes the necessity of determining their molecular structures, peculiarly the number of rings. The comparative analysis of OH-initiated (daytime) and NO3-driven (nocturnal) terpinolene oxidation mechanism, highlighted the formation of RONO2 OOMs, would be conducive to molecular structure identification of OOMs in atmospheric monitoring and atmospheric chemical model refinement."

Ziemke;Antje Inness;Roeland Van Malderen;Lars Hoffmann,Harmonisation of sixteen tropospheric ozone satellite data records,"The first Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report (TOAR) encountered discrepancies between several satellite sensors’ estimates of the distribution and change of ozone in the free troposphere. Therefore, contributing to the second TOAR, we harmonise as much as possible the observational perspective of sixteen tropospheric ozone products from satellites. This only partially accounts for the observed discrepancies, with a reduction of 10–40 % of the inter-product dispersion upon harmonisation. 
 The first Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report (TOAR, 2014–2019) encountered several observational challenges that limited the confidence in estimates of the burden, short-term variability, and long-term changes of ozone in the free troposphere. One of these challenges is the difficulty to interpret the consistency of satellite measurements obtained with different techniques from multiple sensors, leading to differences in spatiotemporal sampling, vertical smoothing, a-priori information, and uncertainty characterisation. This motivated the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) to initiate a coordinated activity VC-20-01 on improving the assessment and harmonisation of tropospheric ozone measured from space. Here, we report on work that contributes to this CEOS activity, as well as to the ongoing second TOAR assessment (TOAR-II, 2020–2025). Our objective is to harmonise the spatiotemporal perspective of (sixteen) satellite ozone data records, thereby accounting as much as possible for differences in vertical smoothing and sampling. Four harmonisation methods are presented to achieve this goal: two for ozone profiles obtained from nadir sounders (UV-visible, IR, and combined UV-IR), and two for tropospheric ozone column products derived by one of the residual methods (Convective Cloud Differential or Limb–Nadir Matching). We discuss to what extent harmonisation may affect assessments of the spatial distribution, seasonal cycle, and long-term changes in free tropospheric ozone, and we anchor the harmonised profile data to ozonesonde measurements recently homogenised as part of TOAR-II. We find that approaches that use global ozone fields as a transfer standard (here the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service ReAnalysis, CAMSRA) to constrain the harmonisation generally lead to the largest reduction of the inter-product dispersion (IPD) between satellite datasets. These harmonisation efforts, however, only partially account for the observed discrepancies between the satellite datasets, with a reduction of about 10 %–40 % of the IPD upon harmonisation, depending on the products involved and with strong spatiotemporal dependences. This work therefore provides evidence that it is not only the differences in spatiotemporal smoothing and sampling, but rather the differences in measurement uncertainty that pose the main challenge to the assessment of the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of free tropospheric ozone from satellite observations."

Launched in November 2022, MATS uses a limb-viewing telescope to capture high-resolution images of noctilucent clouds and airglow, visualising wave patterns in the high atmosphere. This paper accompanies the public release of the Level 1b dataset, i.e. calibrated limb images. Later products will provide global maps of gravity wave properties, airglow, and noctilucent clouds. 
 MATS (Mesospheric Airglow/Aerosol Tomography and Spectroscopy) is a Swedish satellite mission designed to investigate atmospheric gravity waves. In order to observe wave patterns, MATS observes structures in the O2 atmospheric band airglow (light emitted by oxygen molecules in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere), as well as structures in noctilucent clouds (NLCs) which form around the mesopause.  The main instrument is a telescope that continuously captures high-resolution images of the atmospheric limb. Using tomographic analysis of the acquired images, the MATS mission can reconstruct waves in three dimensions and provide a comprehensive global map of the properties of gravity waves. The data provided by the MATS satellite will thus be three-dimensional fields of airglow and NLC properties in 200 km-wide (across track) strips along the orbit at altitudes of 70 to 110 km. By adding spectroscopic analysis, by separating light into six distinct wavelength channels, it also becomes possible to derive temperature and microphysical NLC properties. Based on those data fields, further analysis will yield gravity wave parameters, such as the wavelengths, amplitudes, phase, and direction of the waves, on a global scale.The MATS satellite, funded by the Swedish National Space Agency, was launched in November 2022 into a 580 km sun-synchronous orbit with a 17.25 local time of the ascending node (LTAN). This paper accompanies the public release of the Level 1b (v. 1.0) dataset from the MATS limb imager. The purpose of the paper is to provide background information in order to assist users to correctly and efficiently handle the data. As such, it details the image processing and how instrumental artefacts are handled. It also describes the calibration efforts that have been carried out on the basis of laboratory and in-flight observations, and it discusses uncertainties that affect the dataset."

Andersen,The Greenland Ice-Marginal Lake Inventory Series from 2016 to 2023,"We mapped 2918 ice-marginal lakes across Greenland (2016–2023), revealing changes in size, abundance and temperature. This open dataset improves understanding of terrestrial water storage, glacier dynamics, and Arctic ecology, supporting research on sea level rise, glacier-lake interactions, and sustainable resource planning including hydropower development under Greenland’s climate commitments. 
 Ice-marginal lakes form at the edge of the Greenland Ice Sheet and its surrounding peripheral glaciers and ice caps (PGIC), where outflowing glacial meltwater is trapped by a moraine, or by the ice itself, and create a reservoir that is in contact with the adjacent ice. While glacial meltwater is typically assumed to flow directly into the ocean, ice-marginal lakes temporarily store a portion of this runoff, influencing glacier dynamics and ablation, ecosystems, and downstream hydrology. Their presence, and change in abundance and size, remain under-represented in projections of sea level change and glacier mass loss. Here, we present an eight-year (2016–2023) inventory of 2918 automatically classified ice-marginal lakes (≧0.05 km2) across Greenland, tracking changes in lake abundance, surface extent, and summer surface temperature over time. Fluctuations in lake abundance were most pronounced at the north (22 %) and northeast (14 %) PGIC margins and the southwest Ice Sheet margin (8 %). Over the study period, an increase in surface lake area was evident at 283 lakes, a decreasing trend was evident at 240 lakes, and 1373 remained stable (±0.05 km2). The northeast region contained the largest lakes, with a median size of 0.40 km2 at the ice sheet margin and 0.24 km2 at PGIC margins. Average summer surface temperatures fluctuated between 3.8 °C (2018) and 5.3 °C (2023), with spatial and temporal trends identified with possible links to lake setting and size. Validation against manually identified lakes showed 64 % agreement, yielding an error estimate of −809 lakes (36 %), while lake area uncertainty was ±5 %. Surface temperature estimates showed strong agreement with in situ measurements (r2=0.87, RMSE =1.68 °C, error ±1.2 °C). This dataset provides a crucial foundation for quantifying meltwater storage at ice margins and refining sea level contribution projections while supporting research on glacier-lake interactions, Arctic ecology, and environmental management.

These changes in TC genesis can be explained by the anomalous environmental conditions in different NPMM years, which can be further linked to the NPMM's strength as well as sea surface temperature anomalies over the tropical western Pacific."

The observed increase in the VSCS frequency is closely associated with the enhanced lower‐middle tropospheric relative humidity due to the vertical moisture advection processes. The strengthened upward motion is primarily caused by anomalous positive vorticity advection by mean westerly flows. Through analysis of Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project (DAMIP) experiments, it is demonstrated that the mid‐level cyclonic circulation trend is predominantly forced by greenhouse gas emissions, while anthropogenic aerosols exert a dampening effect. These findings underscore an escalating risk of stronger cyclones for the densely populated coastal nations around the NIO under continued climate change."

This study utilizes local S‐wave splitting analysis to investigate crustal and upper mantle deformation associated with seamount subduction beneath northern Luzon. Our observations reveal predominantly trench‐normal fast‐axis orientations and frequency‐dependent delay times. These patterns suggest that anisotropy arises primarily from fluid‐filled cracks and possible serpentinization, with effects extending from the overriding crust into the subducting slab, spanning multiple structural depths. In contrast, trench‐parallel directions in southern non‐seamount subduction regions indicate either ductile overriding lithosphere deformation or toroidal mantle flow around the slab edge. Event depth and raypath geometry further indicate that seamount subduction promotes stress heterogeneity and vertical anisotropic layering. These findings demonstrate that subducting features such as seamounts produce distinct anisotropy signatures, offering new insights into subduction dynamics and lithospheric deformation."

Its high resolution means that parameterizations of convection and clouds, including subgrid‐scale clouds, are omitted, relying on explicit simulation but necessarily utilizing microphysics and turbulence parameterizations. Standard‐resolution (10–100 km) models, which use convection and cloud parameterizations, have substantial cloud biases over the Southern Ocean (SO), adversely affecting radiation and sea surface temperature. The SO is dominated by low clouds, which cannot be observed accurately from space due to overlapping clouds, attenuation, and ground clutter. We evaluated SO clouds in ICON and the ERA5 and MERRA‐2 reanalyzes using approximately 2400 days of lidar observations and 2300 radiosonde profiles from 31 voyages and a Macquarie Island station during 2010–2021, compared to the model and reanalyzes using a ground‐based lidar simulator. We found that ICON and the reanalyzes underestimate the total cloud fraction by about 10% and 20%, respectively. ICON and ERA5 overestimate the cloud occurrence peak at about 500 m, associated with underestimated lower tropospheric stability and overestimated lifting condensation level. The reanalyzes strongly underestimate fog and very low‐level clouds, and MERRA‐2 underestimates cloud occurrence at almost all heights.

The fraction of light directed toward low elevation angles is determined relative to the total emission into the upper hemisphere. This approach aims to identify locations that exhibit an increased amount of light emission at angles near the horizontal, thereby contributing to the extensive propagation of light pollution into the surrounding environment. The method is based on analysis of the halo of diffuse light around cities, specifically the radiance values R1 ${R}_{1}$ and R2 ${R}_{2}$, measured in the direction of an artificially lit urban area, before and beyond its nearest and farthest boundaries, as observed from satellite. Unlike traditional approaches, the method avoids the exhaustive process of directly monitoring all city lights but relies on and embraces relative radiance patterns. Although the method is not based solely on the R1/R2 ${R}_{1}/{R}_{2}$ ratio, values exceeding unity are typically associated with a high fraction of light flux at low elevation angles. The method presented here offers an experimentally simple approach for systematically identifying sources with substantial potential to transport light pollution over long distances ultimately contributing to skyglow even in remote areas. The results reveal the significant dependence of the method on aerosol optical depth and aerosol stratification around cities."

Cloud and radiative properties were examined at daily and monthly resolutions in four seasons. Low clouds were found to be most prevalent throughout the year, followed by deep clouds.

This study investigated the spatial patterns of AA in the past and future and explored the role of sea ice in modulating AA and its local driving mechanisms. The results demonstrate that the intensity and spatial extent of AA peaked around the 2000s, followed by a gradual decline in subsequent decades. AA exhibits distinct geographical specificity, with marginal sea ice zones functioning as perennial amplification cores. These regions maintain active intensification during autumn and winter. There are strong correlations between the rapid decline of sea ice and AA. Fragmented ice acts as a catalyst, amplifying the trans‐seasonal release of the ocean energy mechanism. As sea ice continues to decline and ice‐free periods emerge in summer in the mid‐21st century, we found that the absence of sea ice as a mediator will gradually diminish the warming asymmetry between the Arctic and the globe, according to Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 future scenario projections.

Model simulations were compared with ground‐based and remote sensing observations as well as field measurements from the Community Research on Climate and Urban Science (CROCUS) project. Our findings show that the movement of a low‐pressure system from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic, combined with the high‐pressure system over the Atlantic, caused the transport of aerosols from Canadian wildfires to the US. Results show WRF‐Chem significantly underestimated key atmospheric components: aerosol optical depth (AOD) by over 50%, PM2.5 $P{M}_{2.5}$ by 65%–90% and peak O3 ${O}_{3}$ concentrations by 50%–55% across four biomass burning data sets. Additionally, CO and NO2 $N{O}_{2}$ concentrations were underpredicted. The substantial underestimation of PM2.5 $P{M}_{2.5}$ led to an overestimation of temperature by up to 3.6° ${}^{\circ}$C primarily due to excessive downward shortwave radiation, which resulted from the underestimation of direct aerosol effects and an increase in sensible heat flux. Among the biomass‐burning data sets, QFED produced the most accurate AOD and PM2.5 $P{M}_{2.5}$ predictions due to improved wildfire emission estimates, leading to a 1.0 to 1.5° ${}^{\circ}$C reduction in temperature overestimation during the daytime. These findings underscore the need for improving wildfire emission estimates for trace gases and aerosols to enhance air quality and weather feedback predictions."

We in this study suggest the NAO–NAT relationship is combinedly modulated by the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV)–Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and the latent heat flux (LHF) plays a key role during the process. The cyclonic anomaly over the subtropical North Atlantic as the consequence of positive AMV and negative PDO enhances the LHF on the decadal time scale, which promotes consistent covariation in the atmospheric baroclinicity and the eddy‐mean flow interaction. It leads to positive feedback manifesting the NAO–NAT relationship. Conversely, the negative AMV and positive PDO can symmetrically weaken the NAO–NAT relationship. The above mechanism is verified by model experiment.

Kumar,Snow Cover Plays a Non‐Dominant Role in WRF/Noah‐MP Simulated Surface Air Temperature Cold Biases Over the Western U.S.,"Atmospheric models generally exhibit cold biases in 2‐m air temperature (T2) across mountainous regions during snow seasons. This study evaluates whether snow cover errors are the primary driver for the persistent T2 cold bias in coupled WRF/Noah‐MP simulations across the western U.S (WUS) through analyses of T2, ground snow cover fraction (SCF), snow water equivalent (SWE), and surface albedo. Baseline simulations revealed widespread cold biases in maximum daily T2 (T2max), mainly during November–April when snowpack influences the terrestrial energy budget (mean bias = −1.05°C to −1.32°C), with higher elevation areas showing biases up to −5.31°C. Cold biases across the WUS are reduced, on average, by 17%–24% in the simulations using recently enhanced snow compaction and ground SCF parameterizations (hereinafter ARnew) that tend to reduce snow cover and surface albedo. However, notable cold biases still persist in the ARnew simulations, especially in high‐elevation areas, despite underestimates of ground SCF and SWE. Statistical and information theory analyses show very weak connections between T2max biases and biases in ground SCF and SWE. Further, an experiment that imposes unrealistically low ground SCF (mean bias = −75%) still exhibits cold biases, particularly in high‐elevation areas (mean bias for Z > 2,000 m = −1.46°C).

Here, the authors identify two parallel prefrontal pathways: one that suppresses food seeking during potential threats, and another that drives pleasure-based eating even when animals are satiated. 
 Flexibly adjusting food-seeking behaviour in response to food-associated cues and internal states is crucial for animals’ survival. However, the neural mechanisms that modulate cued food-seeking behaviour during varying metabolic (i.e., hungry vs. satiated) and emotional (i.e., safe vs. threatened) states remain elusive. Here, we show that the encoding of metabolic or threat states in projection-defined neurons in the prelimbic cortex (PL) mediates cued food-seeking responses in rats. Using microendoscopic imaging, we demonstrate that neural population dynamics in PL consistently represent food cues, task-relevant behaviours, and internal state changes by recruiting distinct subsets of cue-responsive neurons at each state. Single-unit recording and loss-of-function experiments reveal that activity in divergent PL projections to the anterior paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (aPVT) or the nucleus accumbens (NAc) promotes either hedonic feeding during satiation or food-seeking suppression during threat, respectively. Together, our findings uncover a mechanism by which divergent PL circuits regulate cued food-seeking under distinct metabolic or emotional states.

 Oral vaccines provide a non-invasive approach for cancer immunotherapy but face challenges in gastrointestinal stability, antigen presentation, and mucosal delivery. Here, we present an engineered probiotic-based oral vaccine system, BacOR-Fn-T+phiX174, featuring genetically encoded dual-antigen ferritin arrays and inducible bacterial lysis. Upon oral administration and arabinose induction, the probiotic strain lyses in situ, releasing OVA/TRP2-decorated ferritin nanoparticles that efficiently traverse the intestinal barrier via M-cell targeting and activate mucosal dendritic cells. This platform robustly stimulates CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses, enhances B-cell and macrophage activation, reduces regulatory T cells, and provides therapeutic efficacy against melanoma in both lung metastasis and subcutaneous tumor models. It also establishes durable immunological memory without disrupting systemic or mucosal homeostasis. This work offers a programmable bacterial chassis for precise antigen array presentation and controlled delivery, representing a promising strategy for next-generation, needle-free cancer vaccines.

The authors show that stem growth advances slower than photosynthesis per degree Celsius, creating a phenological mismatch for carbon. 
 The dynamics of carbon allocation in trees affect carbon storage of forest ecosystems and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations on Earth. Here, using carbon fluxes and xylem phenology from 84 conifer forests across the Northern Hemisphere, we quantify the phenology of carbon sources (photosynthesis) and sinks (stem growth) along a thermal gradient from −4.4 to 18.2 °C in mean annual temperature. The onset of stem growth advances by 2.3 days per degree Celsius with rising temperatures, 2 times slower than photosynthesis. Warmer sites accumulate less chilling than colder sites, thus trees require more heat to reactivate. The ending of photosynthesis and wood formation is delayed by 2.0 days per degree Celsius. Overall, the photosynthetic season lengthens by one month more than the growing season towards the warmest sites. Climate warming tends to intensify the mismatch between the phenology of carbon sources and sinks, potentially affecting the carbon sequestration in conifer forests. Measurements of carbon fluxes and wood phenology are used to assess carbon sources from photosynthesis and their sink into woody growth along a thermal gradient.

Here the authors show that extreme day-to-day temperature changes have distinct impacts on human health and become more frequent and intense in mid- to low latitudes with climate change. 
 Global warming is increasing the number and intensity of many extreme weather and climate events. Here we argue that extreme day-to-day temperature changes, exceeding the 90th percentile threshold of historical records, are an independent, but largely ignored, aspect of extreme weather events. Such extreme temperature changes have a stronger impact on human health in many locations than do diurnal temperature variations. Global observations show that such events have become more frequent since the 1960s in low and mid-latitudes but decreased at high latitudes, primarily due to GHG forcing. Climate models project a further amplification of extreme day-to-day temperature changes under warming, with frequency, amplitude and total intensity rising by ~17%, ~3% and ~20%, respectively, by 2100 in regions covering 80% of global population. Increased extreme day-to-day temperature changes are associated with drier soil and increased variability in pressure and soil moisture, posing substantial risks to societal and ecosystem resilience and adaptation.

 Multiple climate extremes can coincide in time or happen sequentially and become a compound hazard. Recently, frequent occurrences of successive hot-pluvial extremes (SHPEs) have been presented, yet the risk of SHPEs on crop yield has not been investigated. Here we reveal peril of recurrent occurrences of SHPEs during intra-growing season and their connection with subsequent yield loss over breadbasket regions. Our results show an increasing trend in evolution of recurrent SHPEs during intra-growing seasons from 1979 to 2024. A significant risk of synchronized low crop yields is found in breadbasket regions, as shown by negative yield percentage changes and linear regression analysis. XGBoost classifier model predicts a negative likelihood of 49%, 50%, 49%, and 50% for maize, rice, soybean, and wheat yield responses to the emergence of frequent SHPE events, respectively. Alternatively, XGBoost regression surpasses and explains 36% of yield variability caused by recurrent occurrences of SHPEs globally for the studied crops, although it exhibits heterogeneities across different regions. The insights provide a foundation for considering the actual risk, which ultimately contributes to improving crop yield.

 Most volcanic eruptions occur in high-relief terrains, however the impact of mountainous topography on lava emplacement is poorly constrained. Here we use analogue materials (syrup, glycerol) to investigate lava effusion where changes in channel width form constrictions, leading to fluid/lava backup. Backup magnitude positively correlates with high volumetric fluid/lava fluxes, high fluid/lava viscosities, and narrow constrictions. Viscosity modulates the impacts of slope: steep slopes produce the largest backups when viscosity is high ( ~ 50 Pa s), while shallow slopes produce the largest backups at low viscosities ( ~ 1.5 Pa s). Scaling experimental results to natural systems, we propose lava backup occurs due to three primary reasons: (i) obstacle-flow interaction, (ii) constriction-induced flux imbalance and (iii) choked flow caused by critical flow transition. Lavas inundating constrictive topographies are highly susceptible to backup, causing excess upstream lava inundation and prolonged downstream effusion, increasing the inundation area and extending the time that communities are at risk.

 The world’s energy supply depends critically on hydraulic fracturing (HF) to access otherwise uneconomical resources. Unfortunately, HF also has the potential to induce larger earthquakes – with some projects being prematurely terminated because of perceived earthquake risks. To de-risk HF, we use a suite of statistical tests to discern if some physical process has restricted the growth of earthquake magnitudes. We show that all stage stimulations at both UK PNR-1z and Helsinki St1 indicate bound fracture growth, implying a more controllable operation. Contrastingly, stimulations at Utah FORGE and UK PNR-2 sequentially transitioned into unbound fault reactivation. The problematic stages (that ultimately led to the termination of PNR-2) are clearly distinguishable. We postulate that our research can discriminate fracture stimulation from fault reactivation, contributing to the de-risking of HF operations worldwide. Our statistical tests provide a framework for model falsification, which can guide physical insights into the bounding processes.

 Understanding when and how evolved rocks formed on terrestrial planets remains a fundamental question in planetary geology. Mars preserves ancient surface rocks, providing unique opportunities to study early crustal formation. Here we report extensive detections of feldspathic, possibly anorthositic, rocks uplifted by the Argyre basin-forming impact using orbital remote sensing. The radial distribution of these feldspathic outcrops indicates they originated from the lower martian crust, positioned stratigraphically between olivine-bearing materials and low-calcium pyroxene-bearing upper crustal rocks. This stratigraphy resembles observations at the Hellas basin, suggesting feldspar-rich rocks are widespread in the lower crust. The spatial association of plagioclase-rich outcrops with pyroxene and olivine-bearing units resembles layered mafic intrusions on Earth, suggesting large-scale melting early in Mars’s history produced differentiated igneous complexes. These observations offer direct evidence to support and refine existing models of early crust formation, addressing key questions regarding crustal properties and formation that have lacked widespread observational constraints.

 Cosmic-ray muons are naturally abundant, high-energy particles that can probe geological structures. Muography exploits muon attenuation or scattering to infer density variations, offering a non-invasive and cost-effective method for subsurface studies. We present laboratory and Monte Carlo simulation evidence for density estimation of porous media with varying fluid saturation, measured by coincident muon flux using plastic scintillator detectors. Muon flux was recorded after transmission through acrylic and sand samples of known density and thickness, and the results were validated against simulations that tracked attenuation as a function of density. Muon flux attenuation systematically reflected changes in material density and fluid saturation. Using a Gaussian-filtered dataset and an exponential model, the estimated bulk density of acrylic closely matched the known value (1.19 g cm⁻³), with relative errors decreasing from 11.1% at 20 cm to 0.34% at 80 cm. For variably saturated sands, densities ranged from 1.01 ± 0.12 g cm⁻³ (0% saturation) to 1.54 ± 0.13 g cm⁻³ (100% saturation), with relative errors improving from 21.1% to 10.8%. Numerical simulations reproduced the same attenuation trends, with errors of less than 1%. These findings demonstrate muography’s sensitivity to subtle density variations, highlighting its potential for reservoir monitoring and imaging density-linked fluid dynamics.

 Traditional wildfire fuel management faces critical barriers due to high cost, carbon emissions, and operational risks. While biochar technology offers a solution, the poor awareness of forest fuel biochar hinders its global implementation. Here we produced biochar from boreal and temperature forest surface fuels. Large-scale characterization revealed its composition, performance, and the chemical and molecular changes of the carbon components. The pyrolysis mechanism was clarified, and advanced analysis was integrated to predict functions and quantify the relationships between raw material, pyrolysis conditions, biochar properties, and functions. It was demonstrated that fuel biochar has important functions in mitigating greenhouse benefits, improving soil, and pollution control. The proposed conversion strategy enables permanent carbon dioxide sequestration of at least 383.61-712.18 kg per ton of fuel.

 Potato cultivation in China grew only modestly after the 2015 Potato as Staple Food policy, amid grain crop prioritization. Here, we identified grain crop low-yield regions and compared grain crop versus potato performance in productivity, economics, and carbon emissions using the crop model and life cycle impact assessment model. We found that planting potato in these regions would increase crop productivity by 2%‒119%, lower greenhouse gas emissions and intensities by 6%‒85% and 26%‒92%, respectively, while the economic returns increased from generally lower than $600 for the original crops to over $1600 per hectare. However, switching to potato in low-yield wheat and maize regions would reduce calorie supply by over 70%, though these reductions would not affect overall caloric provision at the national level. Our results show that substituting traditional crops with potato offers multiple benefits, enhancing productivity and economic returns while simultaneously reducing carbon emissions, with minimal trade-offs in China.

 The accurate three-dimensional (3D) distribution of plant area density (PAD) within forests is crucial for understanding canopy structure and provides essential scene inputs for 3D Radiative Transfer Models (RTMs) to facilitate remote sensing interpretation. However, current lidar-based voxelization methods that estimate detailed PAD distributions often cover limited areas, constraining their applications in conducting broad forest studies and interpreting Earth Observation Satellite (EOS) data of various scales and resolutions. To address this, we developed the Large-Scale Path Volume Leaf Area Density (LS-PVlad), a novel forest 3D reconstruction workflow capable of producing extensive high-resolution 3D voxelized forest scenes (up to 100 km2 with ≤2 m voxel size) from worldwide open-access airborne lidar scanning (ALS) data. By applying LS-PVlad to the ALS data acquired during the extensive NASA Goddard's LiDAR, Hyperspectral & Thermal Imager (G-LiHT) campaigns, we developed the first release of FoScenes—a high-fidelity PAD product comprising 40 seamless scenes from 28 diverse forest sites, with individual area ranging from ∼50 to ∼11,000 ha. The leaf area estimates of LS-PVlad have been validated by two-year field-measured leaf area index (LAI) from litter collection (best RMSE = 0.35 m2/m2) and digital hemispherical photography (DHP) images (RMSE = 0.46 m2/m2) across multiple plots at a deciduous forest site. Additionally, a broad comparison between FoScenes and MODIS plant/leaf area index product demonstrates high consistency (R2 = 0.70, RMSE = 0.86 m2/m2).

 The vegetation greening trend resulting from afforestation in the Southwest China’s karst (SCK) area has attracted significant research attention. Identifying the interannual variation in net primary productivity (NPP), its sustained reaction to climate change, and differences between new and old forests before and after afforestation is vital in assessing the effect of the climate on the carbon sink potential of ecosystems. Using monthly NPP and climate data for 1981–2019, ensemble empirical mode decomposition was employed for the extraction of the interannual signal, and new and old forests were compared based on changepoint detection and forest-age data. According to the results, (1) NPP change significantly increased in 1981–2019; after 2001, the NPP growth rate in new forests was 1.47 times that in the old forests, indicating greater carbon sink potential. (2) NPP was sensitive to climate change on an interannual scale, and the sensitivity increased further after 2001. (3) Additionally, the main determinant of NPP in old and new forests shifted from precipitation to soil surface water content after 2001,which closely aligns with the implementation of large-scale ecological restoration projects. The findings reveal that afforestation reinforces water constraints and shifts the dominant climatic control, providing a basis for evaluation of ecological restoration effectiveness in the SCK area and supporting incorporation of water and carbon trade-offs into afforestation planning and routine forest management. This study also provides methodological and case-based support for conducting climate sensitivity assessments of afforestation initiatives across different countries and regions."

 Crop yield prediction at a fine spatial scale is crucial for improving agricultural management and resource allocations. Many countries and regions lack fine-scale yield data for fine-scale modeling and thus have to use a “cross-scale pathway”, where coarse-scale (e.g., state-level) data are used to train a model for fine-scale (e.g., county-level or field-level) yield predictions. However, the cross-scale pathway has limited effectiveness in predicting yield due to issues with data availability and model scalability. In this study, we quantify the benefits of transfer learning in the cross-scale pathway. We applied transfer learning by fine-tuning a previously trained and validated AI-based machine learning model, originally developed for field-level soybean yield predictions in the United States, using Brazilian state-level data to predict Brazilian municipal-level soybean yield. Despite differences in environmental conditions, crop phenology, and yield responses between the U.S. and Brazil, we show that transfer learning improves the municipal-level predictions from the cross-scale pathway by increasing the R2 from 0.29 (without transfer learning) to 0.44. Notably, this is achieved without using any municipal-level data and relying only on scarce state-level observations. When the municipal-level data were used, the transfer learning achieved an R2 of 0.57, the most stable high performance compared with previous studies. The effectiveness of the cross-scale pathway, thus, increases from 50% to 78% with transfer learning. These findings demonstrate the benefits of transfer learning in the cross-scale pathway under data-limited conditions, and underscore the potential for global crop yield predictions across scales."

 Slums are densely populated urban areas characterized by substandard housing and squalor. These areas often lack basic infrastructure and services, making them challenging to manage and improve. Mapping slums on a large scale is particularly difficult due to their complex, dynamic, and non-uniform nature and the scarcity of available data. This study employs deep learning and uncertainty estimation to map slum areas in 55 diverse cities. We tackle the issues of scarce labels, noisy labels, and class imbalance to produce reliable slum probability maps. Applied to a large dataset from the Global South, our method approximates probability values to each image, yielding a more granular view of slum morphology within each city. We achieve this by combining Monte Carlo sampling through test-time augmentation, test-time dropout on overlapping image tiles, and an ensemble of four CNNs. The resulting probability maps not only quantify prediction uncertainty but also reveal morphological patterns of slum settlements. Our findings underscore the diversity and complexity of slums, contributing to a more complete understanding of these environments. A key result is our large-scale workflow, which, despite limited data, groups predictions by probability into multiple slum categories defined by their morphological traits. This approach offers a substantial improvement over traditional binary slum classification methods that focus solely on typical slum morphologies."

 This study presents the first high-resolution Regional Climate Model 5 (RegCM5) analysis of the unprecedented May–June 2024 heatwave in India, evaluating the role of absorbing aerosols—black carbon (BC) and dust—in amplifying extreme heat. Heatwaves have a severe impact on health, mortality, and agriculture, with absorbing aerosols exacerbating warming. MERRA-2 Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) anomalies show that BC peaked at +0.027 in May, weakening in June, while dust remained higher (up to +0.36), intensifying over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and northwestern India. RegCM5 simulations, validated against India Meteorological Department (IMD) observational data, indicate that these aerosols amplified surface temperature anomalies, with BC-induced warming exceeding +4 °C in northern India during May, while dust produced stronger anomalies, surpassing +5 °C in the IGP and Rajasthan in June. BC-induced warming was vertically distributed and more pronounced under clear skies, whereas dust-induced warming was surface-concentrated and persisted longer in regions with higher dust concentrations. Both aerosols increased net shortwave radiation (SWR; >300 W m−2 for BC, ∼270 W m−2 for dust) and upward longwave radiation (ULR; >130 W m−2), inducing surface energy imbalances. This radiative forcing caused lower-tropospheric warming (up to +3 °C at 925 hPa for BC and 850 hPa for dust) and humidity deficits (−0.009 kg/kg), which stabilised the atmosphere, suppressed convection, and delayed monsoon onset. These findings highlight aerosol–radiation interactions as critical drivers of heatwave onset and persistence, emphasizing the need for their integration into regional climate models and early warning systems."

 The European Union has implemented policies to promote renewable energy, with an emphasis on biomass for heat generation. However, residential biomass combustion is a major source of particulate matter (PM10), and its chemical constituents pose health concerns worldwide. This study characterised the organic and inorganic composition, oxidative potential (OP), and ecotoxicity of PM10 indoors and outdoors during the operation of two heating appliances fuelled with different types of biomasses: a modern hydronic stove and a traditional wood stove. PM10 concentrations were higher in the room equipped with the traditional system during the combustion of briquettes (95.9 ± 74.9 μg m−3) and firewood (50.1 ± 25.6 μg m−3), compared to the modern stove using pellets (27.1 ± 11.8 μg m−3) and olive stone (23.0 ± 4.5 μg m−3). While element oxides accounted for similar PM10 mass fractions (7 %), the wood stove produced higher levels of organic constituents, including carbonaceous fractions, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), quinones and saccharides. Significant correlations between OP assays and concentrations of PAHs, quinones and phenolic compounds were found in the room equipped with wood stove, with indoor to outdoor (I/O) ratios higher than 1. In contrast, I/O ratios below 1 were observed for OP in PM10 samples collected during hydronic stove operation. Ecotoxicity assays using Aliivibrio fischeri classified indoor PM10 from the wood stove as 'very toxic', whereas samples from the hydronic stove exhibited lower toxicity and OP levels. These findings highlight the need to reconcile renewable energy goals with air quality and public health."

 High-resolution emission inventories (EIs) are critical for policymakers to develop air pollution mitigation strategies. However, traditional EIs are often outdated due to data lag. Here, we develop a novel framework for high-resolution EI inversion based on response surface model. Application to a continuous pollution episode in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) demonstrates that the posterior emissions significantly improve the simulation accuracy of NO2 and O3, revealing new spatiotemporal distribution patterns of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and O3 sensitivity regimes. The posterior NOx emissions decreased by 12.5 % compared to the prior emissions, with emissions primarily concentrated during the daytime and significantly reduced during nighttime. Besides, emissions decreased in central cities while increasing in peripheral cities, reflecting the notable impact of policies such as transportation electrification and industrial relocation. And changes in emissions notably impacted the spatial distribution of pollutants and atmospheric oxidation capacity, with the VOC-limited regime during the daytime expanding from central cities to surrounding areas. Finally, we uncover that Red Alert measures are insufficient to bring daily maximum 8-h average (MDA8) O3 concentrations into compliance during extreme weather in the PRD. The framework developed in this study provides policymakers with a robust tool to more effectively and promptly understand local emissions and implement targeted control strategies."

 This study examines Black Carbon (BC) and Brown Carbon (BrC) spectral absorption properties during contrasting periods dominated by residential wood burning (RWB) emissions (winter), and by regional-background carbonaceous aerosols (summer). The measurements were performed in Ioannina, a medium-sized Greek city, with the objective of understanding the contributions of primary and secondary carbonaceous aerosols (BC, BrC) from various sources (RWB, vehicular emissions, regional sources) to total absorption. During winter, the site experiences a heavy aerosol burden with high concentrations of PM2.5, organic carbon (OC), BC from wood burning (BCwb) and levoglucosan. Conversely, in summer, cleaner atmospheric conditions prevail, with increased impacts from vehicle emissions and regional background aerosols. During winter, BrC absorption dominated (64 % of total absorption at 370 nm), influenced by strong emissions, limited dispersion, and secondary aerosol formation. Secondary BrC (BrCsec) formation was promoted by the abundance of RWB emissions during nighttime, while there was also evidence of increased BrCsec absorption under enhanced O3 and low NOx conditions during midday. In summer, the absorption characteristics differed notably, and were mostly driven by BC from fossil-fuel combustion, regional aerosols, and atmospheric processing including photo-bleaching. An analysis of spectral absorptions at the near-UV and visible spectrum (370, 470, 660 nm) revealed seasonal and diurnal differences in the contributions of various chromophores. During winter, the coating of BC with OC and inorganic species (lensing effect) resulted in absorption enhancement, while strong RWB emissions led in the curvature of spectral absorption, as evidenced by a significant increase in Ångström exponent (AAE) by decreasing wavelength. The observed levels, the variability in spectral absorption properties, and the contributing sources and processes indicate the complexity and challenges of characterizing the radiative effects of urban carbonaceous aerosol."

 Unique observations from the Cloud Aerosol Interaction and Precipitation Enhancement Experiment (CAIPEEX Phase-IV) revealed the complex multi-layer structure of monsoon clouds, offering key insights into their microphysical and thermodynamic processes. This study investigates the influence of vertically layered aerosol distributions on cloud microphysical properties over the rain-shadow region of India, focusing on three distinct cloud layers: a highly polluted boundary layer cloud, a cleaner mid-layer cloud, and a polluted upper-level cloud. Results show that aerosol layering significantly influences warm cloud microphysics of the layer clouds, including cloud drop radius, liquid water content, spectral width, and cloud droplet number concentration. The drop size distribution (DSD) and particle size distribution (PSD) across the three cloud layers indicated that the middle cloud layer developing under extremely clean conditions exhibited a significantly broader DSD and PSD compared to the other two layers, which formed in environments with slightly higher aerosol loading. Such extremely clean conditions, characterized by cloud droplet number concentrations below 20 cm−3, are rare over continental regions. The upper portion of the top stratiform cloud was characterized by a high concentration of dendritic ice particles, with sizes ranging from 300 to 3000 μm. Just below this dendritic layer, numerous supercooled drizzle drops were observed, with significant aircraft icing. The microphysical characteristics of both the dendritic ice zone and the underlying icing layer containing supercooled drizzle drops were investigated.
