Using reanalysis data, we test two proposed pathways – one at the surface and one in the free troposphere – but find that neither is a dominant mechanism for stratocumulus variability on seasonal and interannual timescales. These results challenge the assumed influence of subtropical highs on stratocumulus and highlight the need for further research into lower-tropospheric stability dynamics. 
 Stratocumulus (Sc) covers the eastern flanks of maritime subtropical high-pressure systems, and changes in their coverage can exert a radiative effect on the global energy budget comparable to that of a doubling of CO2. Previous studies have identified the temperature difference between 700 hPa and the surface as the primary driver of Sc variability. However, the mechanistic linkages between subtropical highs and this critical temperature difference, which defines lower-tropospheric stability, remain unresolved. While subsidence modulates temperatures at 700 hPa and wind-driven cooling affects surface temperatures, the observed decoupling between subtropical highs and Sc fraction on seasonal to interannual timescales lacks a mechanical explanation. This study uses reanalysis data to test two hypothesized pathways linking subtropical highs to the lower-tropospheric stability. Results demonstrate that neither pathway dominates, as correlations between Sc-area temperatures and subtropical high dynamics exhibit strong regional and temporal dependencies. Additionally, Sc-area conditions do not systematically align with subtropical high variability, highlighting the need for further investigation into the dynamical processes governing temperatures in the lower troposphere."

Δ14CO2 measured in airborne flask samples is used to distinguish fossil versus biogenic CO2 sources. Mid-Atlantic US CO2 variability is found to be driven by the biosphere. Errors in modeled fossil fuel CO2 are evaluated using Δ14CO2 airborne data as an avenue to improving future regional models of atmospheric CO2 transport. 
 Accurately quantifying regional anthropogenic CO2 fluxes is fundamental to improving our understanding of the carbon cycle and for creating effective carbon mitigation policies, and the radiocarbon to total carbon ratio in atmospheric CO2 (Δ14CO2) is a robust tracer of fossil fuel CO2 that can discriminate between biogenic and fossil fuel CO2 sources. NASA's Atmospheric Carbon and Transport-America (ACT-America) airborne mission between 2016 and 2019 aimed to improve the accuracy of regional greenhouse gas flux estimates, through refining our understanding and characterization of fluxes and flux uncertainties in models. Δ14CO2 observations from 26 flights are presented for examining seasonal CO2 source partitioning in the Mid-Atlantic USA. Observed variability in boundary layer CO2 at timescales ranging from intra-day to seasonal was largely driven by biogenic CO2 (CO2bio) variability that ranged from −19.7 ppm in summer to 16.2 ppm in fall, while fossil fuel CO2 (CO2ff) variability remained at 3.3±2.0 ppm. Carbonyl sulfide uptake was well-correlated with CO2bio uptake, and examining this relationship, as well as that between CO2 and CO2bio variability reinforces the seasonal extent of gross primary productivity response throughout ACT-America. We use airborne Δ14CO2 flask sampling alongside in situ carbon monoxide measurements to calculate high-frequency CO2ff and evaluate the magnitude and diurnal variability of modeled CO2ff, deducing likely transport errors in an example flight. Although ACT-America CO2ff signals were attenuated due to the broad source regions sampled, results illustrate the value of Δ14CO2 sampling and observation-based methodologies for regional CO2 flux attribution, evaluation and improvement of modeled CO2."

Dust properties are influenced by particle size, mineralogy, shape, and mixing state. This work characterizes freshly emitted individual aerosol particles of Icelandic dust using electron microscopy. Our study provides insights into critical particle-specific information and will contribute to better constraining climate models that consider mineralogical variations in their representation of the dust cycle. 
 Iceland is a significant high-latitude dust source area. Airborne Icelandic dust influences the climate system by interacting with radiation, clouds, and biogeochemical cycles; it also affects snow and ice albedo and air quality. These impacts are sensitive to the dust’s mineralogical, chemical, and physical properties. However, comprehensive measurements and analyses of Icelandic dust particles remain limited. This study examines dust samples collected during a field campaign in the Dyngjusandur desert (August–September 2021) using active and passive aerosol sampling. Over 190 000 individual particles, ranging from 0.1 to 120 µm, were analyzed for their chemical and physical properties using computer-controlled scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (ccSEM/EDX). Results show heterogeneity in particle size, shape, and composition. The most abundant particle type was medium-Al mixed particles, likely glass-like, comprising 35 %–92 % of the aerosol volume. Sulfate particles, suggesting volcanic contributions, were detected in some samples. Iron (Fe)- and titanium (Ti)-rich particles made up 3.3 % and 6 % of the aerosol volume, respectively, mainly in the size fraction < 1 µm. The median aspect ratio ranged from 1.37 to 1.53, increasing with particle size. Our findings highlight key differences in Icelandic dust compared to Saharan dust, including higher iron and titanium content and a lack of potassium in Icelandic dust. Additionally, Icelandic dust shows a size-dependent increase in aspect ratio, unlike Saharan dust, which remains constant. These observations can improve model simulations that account for the effect of high-latitude dust in the Earth system."

It finds that smoke aerosols, predominantly concentrated between 6 and 8 km in the mid-troposphere over southern HTP, likely alter regional atmospheric stability by modifying the vertical temperature profile, as indicated by a reduced lapse rate. 
 Atmospheric pollution from biomass burning contributes to climatic and cryospheric changes by influencing solar radiation and the albedos of snow and ice surfaces over the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau (HTP). We utilize long-term Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire products together with ground-based and satellite-derived aerosol datasets to assess the primary effect of wildfires originating from the southern slopes of the Himalayas on aerosol loading in the HTP. Results reveal consistent interannual and seasonal variation patterns, accompanied by statistically significant correlations between aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 500 nm from AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) stations (Pokhara, Qomolangma (Mt. Everest) Station for Atmospheric and Environmental Observation and Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences (QOMS), Nam Co) and Himalayan fires. Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) data further indicate elevated smoke aerosol extinction coefficients at altitudes of 6 to 8 km (middle troposphere) in the southern HTP during the peak fire season (March–April) in 2021. The intense wildfire activity in 2021 likely induced mid-tropospheric warming and alterations in the vertical temperature structure, evidenced by a pronounced reduction in the absolute lapse rate, representing the rate of temperature decrease with altitude. This reduction was observed at QOMS, South-East Tibetan plateau Station for integrated observation and research of alpine environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences (SETS), and Naqu stations compared to 2022. Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SBDART) simulations estimated increased heating rates (0.38–1.32 K d−1) and atmospheric warming (15.03–22.43 W m−2) in the mid-troposphere due to smoke aerosols. Such warming affects regional atmospheric stability and modulates surface temperatures (∼0.04 K). It is crucial to conduct further research into the heating/cooling processes induced by aerosols and their influence on the vertical temperature structure to comprehensively understand the impacts of aerosols on regional climate and the hydrological cycle."

The seasonality of both pseudo-total chromium content and its valence speciation was examined. The seasonality of changes in Crtot and Cr(VI) concentrations was observed. There was a maximum in the winter season, most likely due to the greater share of fuel combustion sources. Regardless of the season, the risk levels for Radom residents were within the acceptable risk range. 
 The paper assesses chromium occurrence in urban particulate matter – PM10, PM2.5, PM1, and PM0.25 – over a calendar year. The seasonality of both pseudo-total chromium content and its valence speciation are studied. Airborne aerosol was sampled in the city of Radom (Poland) using a Hi-Flow MOUDI model 130 cascade impactor from Copley. Crtot concentrations in the PM fractions investigated ranged from 0.08 to 4.09 ng m−3. The results point to a seasonality of Crtot concentration changes in PM. The concentration of Crtot in PM10 was maximum in winter (2.23 ± 0.53 ng m−3 on average) and averaged 1.71 ± 0.83 ng m−3 in the whole measurement period. The average Cr(VI) concentration did not exceed 0.40 ng m−3 and was maximum in winter, too (max 1.354 ng m−3). The Cr(VI) share in PM in the particular seasons varied from a low in summer (9.1 % of Crtot) to a high in winter (40 % of Crtot). The carcinogenic risk for the urban residents based on the Cr(VI) concentration in PM10 was below the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) threshold for significant risk (between 1 × 10−6 and 1 × 10−4) and amounted to between 1.11 × 10−6 and 5.78 × 10−6 for children and from 3.69 × 10−6 to 1.92 × 10−5 for adults. The non-carcinogenic health risk caused by the presence of Crtot was also lower than the safe level of 1 – the hazard quotient (HQ) values for both adults and children ranged from 1.32 × 10−2 to 3.92 × 10−2. The studies presented in the paper fill the research gap of Crtot and Cr(VI) measurements in particulate matter of different sizes in the air of a medium-sized city in central Poland."

Lee;Mohit L. Dubey;Jonathan F. Dooley;Curtis Shuck;Ken Minschwaner;Andre Santos;Sebastien C. Biraud;Manvendra K. Dubey,Orphaned oil and gas well methane emission rates quantified using Gaussian plume inversions of ambient observations,"This work uses ambient methane and wind measurements to quantify methane emissions from a leaking orphaned oil and gas well using Gaussian plume inversions. Our analysis shows that existing Gaussian plume methods that assume atmospheric stability are prone to large errors. We report a more robust analysis that determines plume dispersion coefficients from our in situ observations. Our technique enables more accurate methane quantification of orphaned oil and gas wells to prioritize plugging. 
 Annually, ∼ 3.6 million abandoned oil and gas wells in the US emit a combined ∼ 2.6 Tg methane (CH4), adversely affecting climate and regional air quality. However, these estimates depend on emission factors derived from measuring subpopulations of wells that vary by orders of magnitude due to very limited field sampling and poorly characterized distributions. Currently, US protocols to remediate orphaned wells lacks standardized quantification methods needed to both prioritize plugging and account for emission reductions. Therefore, sensitive, reliable, affordable, and scalable CH4 flux quantification methods are needed. We report the use of a simple Gaussian plume method where the dispersion parameters are constrained by in situ ground measurements of CH4 concentration at four locations 7.5–49 m downwind of the orphan well as well as local winds to estimate the leak rate from an orphan well. We derive a flux of 10.53 ± 1.16 kg CH4 h−1 during a venting procedure in April 2023 that agrees with the directly measured volumetric flow rate of 9.00 ± 0.25 kg CH4 h−1. This is 71 % greater than the 5.3 kg CH4 h−1 flux measured 7 months prior. Additionally, we discovered a secondary leak through the surface casing inferred as 0.43–0.67 kg CH4 h−1 both by our ground Gaussian analysis and by transecting the plume with an uncrewed aerial system (UAS). We show that in situ determination of the dispersion parameters used in our Gaussian inversions allows us to measure methane emissions to 15 % accuracy, significantly reducing errors when compared to the standard practice of assuming stability class. Our results help develop simpler methods and protocols for robust orphan well emission quantification that can be used for reporting."

It includes predictions for ten major physical and chemical soil properties at various depths, plus a map of total soil depth. For each property, we selected the most accurate models and key environmental drivers. In Southwestern Asia and many arid or semi-arid regions, detailed soil data are often missing. This dataset fills that gap, supporting agriculture, research, planning, and local policy. 
 We present the first detailed soil property maps at multiple depths for the northwestern autonomous Kurdistan region of Iraq (Dohuk). A total of 532 soil samples from 122 sites were collected at five depth increments (0–10, 10–30, 30–50, 50–70, and 70–100 cm), and their mid-infrared (MIR) spectra were measured. A subset of 108 samples, selected via Kennard–Stone sampling, was analysed in a laboratory on ten soil properties. A Cubist model was trained and used from these measured values to predict all samples’ soil properties from their MIR spectra. Digital soil mapping was conducted using various machine learning regression techniques (ensemble learning, linear classifier, nearest neighbour classifier, decision trees), trained on the predicted soil properties and using a total of 85 covariates at 25 m pixel resolution, resulting in 50 prediction maps in total. Results were compared with the SoilGrids 2.0 product and a regional texture model. Soil depth was also mapped using a quantile random forest with 26 covariates. Our regional model outperformed global SoilGrids 2.0 predictions in resolution and accuracy, with texture RMSEs (sand: ∑RMSE = 9.35; silt: ∑RMSE = 6.8; clay: ∑RMSE = 10.28) comparable to local models. Quantile random forest achieved the best performance in 51 % of the models, and key predictors included Sentinel 2 SWIR, EVI, NDVI, and SAVI. Spatial patterns reflected the contrast between the flat areas of the Simele and Zakho plains, as opposed to the shallower and steeper Little Khabur Valley and anticline formations. Furthermore, the soil depth prediction model (R2 = 0.57; RMSE = 2.59 cm-0.5) showed strong correlation with slope and a similar pattern distribution with deeper soils in the flat areas of the Simele and Zakho plains, while shallow soils are visible in the anticline and strongly erodible areas.

 Atmospheric Potential Oxygen (APO, defined as O2 + 1.1 × CO2) is primarily a tracer of ocean biogeochemistry and fossil fuel burning. APO exhibits strong seasonal variability at mid-to-high latitudes, driven mainly by seasonal air-sea O2 exchange. We present results from the first version of the Atmospheric Potential Oxygen forward Model Intercomparison Project (APO-MIP1), which forward transports three air-sea APO flux products in eight atmospheric transport models or model variants, aiming to evaluate atmospheric transport and flux representations by comparing simulations against surface station, airborne, and shipboard observations of APO. We find significant spread and bias in APO simulations at eastern Pacific surface stations, indicating inconsistencies in representing vertical and coastal atmospheric mixing. A framework using airborne APO observations demonstrates that most atmospheric transport models (ATMs) participating in APO-MIP1 overestimate tracer diffusive mixing across moist isentropes (i.e., diabatic mixing) in mid-latitudes. This framework also enables us to isolate ATM-related biases in simulated APO distributions using independent mixing constraints derived from moist static energy budgets from reanalysis, thereby allowing us to assess large-scale features in air-sea APO flux products. Furthermore, shipboard observations show that ATMs are unable to reproduce seasonal APO gradients over Drake Passage and near Palmer Station, Antarctica, which could arise from uncertainties in APO fluxes or model transport. The transport simulations and flux products from APO-MIP1 provide valuable resources for developing new APO flux inversions and evaluating ocean biogeochemical processes."

However, using conventional solvent extraction to recover REEs in PG is inefficient and environmentally burdensome. This study proposes a treatment train for REE recovery from PG, featuring a bioinspired adsorptive separation, and evaluates its environmental and economic performance using a probabilistic sustainability framework that integrates life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic analysis (TEA). Results show the system achieves an internal rate of return (IRR) above 15% in 87% of simulations, suggesting strong profitability potential.

Meanwhile, the targeted siRNA-PS effectively induces pronounced fluorescence quenching of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in tobacco leaves, decreasing by 97.6% after 24 h. Similarly, the vibrant red flowers of glory were tuned to a faded state through the manipulation of color-controlled genes, particularly the mRNA expression of chalcone isomerase (CHI) reduced by 69.4%. Nevertheless, the expression of the GFP gene in tobacco leaves has largely reverted to the baseline levels observed in the control group after 4 days, highlighting the transient and reversible nature of this nongenetic regulation.

The SGD process involves the flow of fresh, saline, or mixed groundwater from coastal aquifers into the oceans classified in different components. Existing studies rarely report the fluxes supplied by the different SGD components; therefore, the relevance of SGD as a source of mercury remains unclear. We aimed to quantify SGD-driven mercury/methylmercury fluxes to the coast, focusing on the largest coastal lagoon in the western Mediterranean. We measured total dissolved mercury and MeHg in surficial and porewaters during the summer and autumn. Porewaters were enriched in total dissolved Hg and MeHg compared to the lagoon. Lagoon shore waters and porewaters with a high concentration of labile dissolved organic matter were prone to MeHg formation and thus had higher MeHg concentrations. The mercury input through SGD to the Mar Menor lagoon (4300 mmol year–1) was similar to atmospheric deposition and 1 order of magnitude greater than the stream input. Among different components of the SGD,  long-scale lagoon water recirculation dominated. These findings have substantial implications for the regional Hg budget and raise awareness of the importance of considering the different SGD components for an accurate estimation of SGD-based Hg input to the coastal ocean."

This study validated the concentration-additive mixture effects of ambient PM2.5 fractions on in vitro interleukin-8 (IL-8) induction, enabling quantification of the role of endotoxin from Gram-negative bacteria in IL-8 induction by PM2.5 from contrasting environments. Endotoxin consistently contributed to PM2.5-induced IL-8 at both the coastal site (0.1–10%) and the urban site (0.1–17%), far exceeding its mass fraction in PM2.5 (<0.0001%). Among reported components, endotoxin demonstrated the highest toxicity-to-mass contribution ratio (10,000:1–100,000:1) due to its high potency. This suggests that reducing PM2.5 toxicity may not necessarily require a proportional reduction in its mass. The sources of Gram-negative bacteria shifted from predominantly natural origins at the coastal site (natural-to-anthropogenic ratio of 1.6:1) to increasing anthropogenic contributions at the urban site (natural-to-anthropogenic ratio of 0.7:1).

Pinto,Integrating Machine Learning with Flow-Imaging Microscopy for Automated Monitoring of Algal Blooms,"Real-time monitoring of phytoplankton in freshwater systems is critical for early detection of harmful algal blooms (HABs) to enable efficient response by water management agencies. This manuscript presents an image processing pipeline developed to adapt ARTiMiS, a low-cost automated flow-imaging device, for real-time algal monitoring in natural freshwater systems. This pipeline addresses several challenges associated with autonomous imaging of aquatic samples, such as flow-imaging artifacts (i.e., out-of-focus and background objects), as well as strategies to efficiently identify novel objects that are not represented in the training data set; the latter is a common challenge with the application of deep learning approaches for image classification in environmental systems. The pipeline leverages a random forest model to identify out-of-focus particles with an accuracy of 89% and a custom background particle detection algorithm to identify and remove particles that erroneously appear in consecutive images with >97 ± 2.8% accuracy. Furthermore, a convolutional neural network (CNN), trained to classify taxonomical classes, achieved 95% accuracy in a closed set classification. Nonetheless, the supervised closed-set classifiers struggled with the accurate classification of objects when challenged with novel particles, which are common in complex natural environments; this limits real-time monitoring applications by requiring extensive manual oversight. To mitigate this, three methods incorporating classification with rejection were tested to improve model precision by flagging irrelevant or unknown classes. Combined, these advances present a fully integrated, end-to-end solution for real-time HAB monitoring in natural freshwater systems, which enhances the scalability of automated detection in dynamic aquatic environments."

Through the so-called forest filter effect (FFE), they can remove both gas and particulate matter (PM) associated organic contaminants, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from air, reducing their concentrations. In this work, new aspects of FFE were investigated through several laboratory experiments of increasing complexity. More specifically, the study was designed to evaluate for the first time the contribution of light and phyllosphere microbial communities of Quercus ilex leaves to the degradation of deuterated PAHs (naphthalene-d8, acenaphthene-d10, phenanthrene-d10, pyrene-d10, chrysene-d12, and perylene-d12). Such degradation was investigated by observing the production of deuterated PAH hydroxy metabolites (OH-PAHs). OH-PAHs were produced in both  light and dark conditions, while their appearance in sterile controls was negligible, highlighting the importance of leaf-associated microorganisms in the degradation of parent PAH. The number of PAH metabolites and their isomers increased when entire leaves were used rather than the inoculated phyllosphere microorganisms only, confirming the degradation ability of native phyllosphere microbial communities. Although preliminary, these results showed that FFE can be enhanced by photo- and biodegradation processes. The continuous removal of PAHs through degradation could result in an enhanced PAH concentration gradient and flux of deposition  to leaves."

Exposome-based analyses utilizing biological samples have been conducted in various countries to assess the impacts of environmental endocrine disruptors and other pollutants on maternal and fetal health during pregnancy, particularly in developed countries. However, large-scale cohort studies that comprehensively cover major maternal and fetal diseases during pregnancy to explore the environmental and genetic interactions affecting maternal and fetal health are still lacking in China. Currently, environmental exposure assessment and biomarker measurement are particularly complex, given the challenges posed by handling mixed exposure effects and the hidden threats posed by emerging contaminants. The China Birth Cohort-Environmental Genetic Factors (CBC-EG) study was established as a large, multicenter cohort study spanning 14 cities across China. A total of 101,437 pregnant women were recruited between 2013 and 2022. The objectives of this cohort study include analyzing the effects of environmental exposure levels and behavioral factors, monitored through external exposure assessments, on embryonic development and pregnancy-related diseases.

It is critical to prioritize potential obesogenic factors and systematically profile their modes of action. Here, based on adverse outcome pathway networks (AONs), we established a machine learning screening system that integrated three adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) to describe the mechanisms of chemical-induced obesity for thousands of chemicals. Notably, optimal AON-informed machine learning models achieved an accuracy above 0.95 and identified amide, aromatic/polycyclic, and nitrogen-containing structures as obesity-related. In addition, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were identified as prime candidate obesogens, inducing metabolic syndrome by interfering with all three signaling pathways across the AONs. Representative obesogens predicted in this study, such as antibiotics, insecticide metabolites, and exogenous chemical glucagon, were found to predominantly target membrane, mitochondrial, and nuclear receptor signaling pathways, respectively. Furthermore, top-prioritized chemicals (such as phenanthrene, azithromycin, 1,8,9-trihydroxyanthracene, etc.) according to ranking scores were randomly selected for experimental verification, and all selected candidates exhibited pathway interference in activating specific molecular initiating events (MIEs), demonstrating the predictive model’s accuracy.

Sorooshian,High Accumulation Mode Aerosol Concentration and Moderate Aerosol Hygroscopicity Limit Impacts of Recent Particle Formation on Northwest Atlantic Post‐Frontal Clouds,"Postfrontal cloud regime transitions often result from strong aerosol‐cloud‐precipitation interaction. Using ACTIVATE measurements from 40 flights, we show a diurnal pattern of evolving aerosol particle size distributions (PSD) in the marine boundary layer upwind of clouds. A nucleation mode grows in size between 12 and 17 LT, likely from new particle formation (NPF), and an accumulation mode increases in concentration during daytime. Selecting the day of strongest size growth, we use quasi‐Lagrangian large‐eddy simulations to examine cloud impacts. With a morning PSD, moderate aerosol hygroscopicity aligns best with satellite and field campaign observational targets. Using a PSD near 17 LT, greater cloud droplet number concentrations delay the precipitation onset and keep albedo elevated for longer, primarily driven by increased accumulation mode concentrations, which facilitate an updraft‐limited regime and inhibit activation of smaller modes despite their growth after NPF. These results constitute a caveat for NPF‐related activation under polluted conditions."

Through analyses of observations and time‐slice model simulations, this study shows that South Asian autumn BC aerosols can cause instant and delayed responses of surface air temperature over the Arctic and Eurasia. In autumn, higher BC loading over South Asia leads to decreased rainfall and tropospheric diabatic cooling there. This cooling can remotely excite an anomalous anticyclone over Europe that transports warm and moist air into the Arctic to precondition sea ice melting over the Barents‐Kara Seas (BKS). The consequent decrease of sea ice cover (SIC) causes BKS warming through increased surface exchange fluxes, and the concurring anomalous anticyclone near the Ural Mountains induces surface cooling over Eurasia. This temperature anomaly pattern can persist into the ensuing winter due to the continued SIC decrease across seasons."

However, the specific implications of these changes on scrub typhus, a vector‐borne infectious disease facing increasing incidence and substantial expansion, remain unclear. Here, we constructed a comprehensive landscape fragmentation index (LFI), which reflects the interaction between human activities and natural habitats. Then we utilized a generalized additive model (GAM) to estimate the comprehensive and segmented impacts of LFI on scrub typhus incidence in China, grouping the results by year, land use type and fragmentation level. Additionally, we projected changes in such impacts under four shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), including SSP1‐2.6, SSP2‐4.5, SSP3‐7.0, and SSP5‐8.5. Key results were: (a) The LFI exhibited a nonlinear positive correlation with scrub typhus incidence. Each 0.1 increase in the LFI was associated with a relative risk of 1.20 (95% CI:1.19–1.21) for scrub typhus. Notably, at higher fragmentation levels, scrub typhus incidence tended to decrease. (b) Forest fragmentation had the most significant impact on scrub typhus, followed by cropland fragmentation, whereas construction land fragmentation was negatively associated. (c) The future areas of elevated scrub typhus risk varied among the SSPs, but they were mainly concentrated at the interface between urban expansion and natural habitats. Our results indicate that human interference with the natural ecosystem is a critical factor for the incidence of scrub typhus. These findings are conducive to promoting ecological protection and the prevention and control of scrub typhus."

While atom losses typically limit these systems to a pulsed mode, continuous operation17−22 could significantly enhance cycle rates, remove bottlenecks in metrology23, and enable deep-circuit quantum evolution through quantum error correction24,25.

Our approach utilizes a series of two optical lattice conveyor belts to transport atom reservoirs into the science region, where atoms are repeatedly extracted into optical tweezers without affecting the coherence of qubits stored nearby. Using a reloading rate of 300,000 atoms in tweezers per second, we create over 30,000 initialized qubits per second, which we leverage to assemble and maintain an array of over 3,000 atoms for more than two hours. Furthermore, we demonstrate persistent refilling of the array with atomic qubits in either a spin-polarized or a coherent superposition state while preserving the quantum state of stored qubits.

Here, the authors demonstrate that unusually curved graphene crystallites exhibit rapid ion transport dynamics and enable the fabrication of thin electrodes for compact energy and power delivery. 
 Supercapacitors deliver high power but are limited in compact applications by low volumetric energy and power densities. Two-dimensional materials like graphene, despite their high packing density, are hindered by poor ion transport kinetics. A rapid thermal annealing step generates unusually curved turbostratic graphene crystallites, integrated and interwoven within disordered domains in micron-size particles to yield multiscale graphene. Ion insertion into the interlayers enables precise pore-ion matching and partial charge transfer, enabling a high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area-normalized capacitance of 85 µF/cm2. Here, we show that multiscale graphene exhibits rapid ion transport dynamics within the curved crystallites and disordered domains. When the thin electrodes are assembled into symmetric pouch cell devices, they deliver a stack-level volumetric energy density of 99.5 Wh/L in ionic liquid electrolytes and 49.2 Wh/L in organic electrolyte with a high power density of 69.2 kW/L at 9.6 Wh/L.

Results in humans are conflicting. In this large study, men with epilepsy or bipolar disorder on valproate did not show a clear increase in infertility. 
 Valproate is highly effective at treating epilepsy and bipolar disorder. It faces prescribing restrictions in men due to concerns it causes testicular dysfunction and infertility. These mostly stem from animal models – the human evidence is limited and conflicting. We report the largest ever retrospective cohort study of infertility in men with epilepsy or bipolar disorder, using real-world healthcare data from TriNetX. 91,917 of the men are exposed to valproate, and 535,803 unexposed. Cohorts are propensity score matched for a comprehensive set of baseline covariates, and survival analysis is undertaken using Cox-proportional hazards models. No significant difference is seen between valproate-exposed and unexposed men across lifetime risks of infertility, testicular hypofunction, testicular atrophy, and a composite of low sperm concentration, motility, vitality, normal forms, and semen volume (p > 0.05). Our findings do not support an association between valproate and infertility in men with epilepsy or bipolar disorder in real-world settings.

 The P2X7 receptor is an ATP-gated ion channel that activates inflammatory pathways involved in diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis, and neurodegeneration. However, despite the potential benefits of blocking overactive signaling, no P2X7 receptor antagonists have been approved for clinical use. Understanding species-specific pharmacological effects of existing antagonists has been challenging, in part due to the dearth of molecular information on receptor orthologs. Here, to identify distinct molecular features in the human receptor, we determine high-resolution cryo-EM structures of the full-length wild-type human P2X7 receptor in apo closed and ATP-bound open state conformations and draw comparisons with structures of other orthologs. We also report a cryo-EM structure of the human receptor in complex with an adamantane-based inhibitor, which we leverage, in conjunction with functional data and molecular dynamics simulations, to design a potent and selective antagonist with a unique polycyclic scaffold. Functional and structural analysis reveal how this optimized ligand, termed UB-MBX-46, interacts with the classical allosteric pocket of the human P2X7 receptor with subnanomolar potency and high selectivity, revealing its significant therapeutic potential.

Here, authors present an electrolyte design strategy to direct distinct solvent molecules to negative and positive electrodes respectively, achieving good stability in initially anode-free sodium metal batteries. 
 Initially anode-free sodium metal batteries offer a high energy density at lower costs than lithium-ion batteries, making them a promising alternative for portable electronics, transportation, and power grids. However, side reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface hinder their practical applications. Our study reveals that negative electrode stability is primarily influenced by the solvents in the cation’s first solvation shell, whereas positive electrode stability is dictated by weakly bonded solvents. Based on this insight, we introduce an electrolyte design strategy to selectively direct 2-methyltetrahydrofuran to the Na metal electrode and tetrahydrofuran to the NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 positive electrode interface, optimizing stability for both electrodes. With this tailored electrolyte, we achieve an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.91% in Na | |Cu cells for 400 cycles at 1 mA/cm2 with 1 mAh/cm2 and demonstrate stable Na plating/stripping for 5000 h at 2 mA/cm² with 2 mAh/cm2 in Na | |Na cells. Furthermore, an initially anode-free sodium metal battery with a positive electrode active material loading of 14.05 mg cm−2 retains 90.9% of its capacity over 150 cycles at 110 mA g−1, even after aging, underscoring its potential for practical applications.

 Continental Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary sections are best known from North America, where they invariably exhibit a marked shift in sedimentary facies at or very near the boundary level. Uppermost Cretaceous strata typically reflect water-logged soils and unstable meandering-river deposits, whereas lowermost Paleogene strata typically reflect coal swamps and broad, stable meander-belt deposits. Causal links between facies shifts at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary and the end-Cretaceous mass extinction have been largely dismissed. Here, we present five new Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary sections identified via iridium anomalies in the Bighorn and Williston basins and assess the sedimentological changes that occur at North American Cretaceous-Paleogene boundaries. We hypothesize that the geographically widespread Cretaceous–Paleogene facies shifts were driven by the extinction of dinosaur megafauna. Large-bodied dinosaurs likely promoted open vegetation structure, prompting fluvial avulsion and clastic sediment input to distal floodplains. After the end-Cretaceous mass extinction, dense forests could establish, stabilizing meander belts and starving the floodplain of clastic sediment, favoring the accumulation of organic-rich strata. More empirical data are needed, but facies change in continental Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary sections suggests dinosaurs were ecosystem engineers that promoted habitat openness in the Late Cretaceous, and their extinction likely led to a dramatic reorganization of ecosystem structure in the earliest Paleogene.

 As a part of Michigan's efforts to identify and address per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) contamination statewide, more knowledge of atmospheric PFAS concentrations is needed to better understand their atmospheric transport and impact on other environmental media. This research aimed to measure atmospheric concentrations of PFAS in Michigan's ambient air using low-cost and easy-to-use passive samplers and identify relationships with environmental factors. Passive samplers, consisting of polyurethane foam (PUF) discs and sorbent-filled polyethylene tubes (radiello-XAD samplers), were deployed for a month at 27 sites across Michigan and analyzed for both ionic and volatile, neutral PFAS. Short chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs), specifically perfluoropropanoic acid (PFPrA) (d.f. 60 %) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) (d.f. 96 %), and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) (d.f. 63 %) were the most frequently detected compounds, with the ∑3PFAS ranging from non-detect to 15.5 pg/m3 for the PUFs and from non-detect to 248 pg/m3 in the radiello-XAD samplers. 6:2 fluorotelomer alcohol was also frequently detected (d.f. 45 %) and had a positive correlation with both population density (r = 0.52, p < .05) and industrial sites' density (r = 0.48, p < .05). Detection of specific compounds on each type of sampler provided insight into the preferential transport pathway of atmospheric PFAS. For example, PFOS was observed mostly in the gas-phase, predominantly captured by the radiello-XAD samplers, while PFBA was mostly in the particle-phase, predominantly captured by the PUFs. This study highlights the importance of developing detection tools for measuring atmospheric PFAS across a vast geographic area to identify contributing factors to ambient concentrations."

 Using the WRF model, this study investigates the impact mechanisms of surface evaporation—including three types (direct soil evaporation, canopy evaporation, and vegetation transpiration), evaporation rates, and re-evaporation of prior precipitation on the “08·24” heavy rainfall event in the Three-River-Headwater Region of Tibet Plateau. Results demonstrate that eliminating direct soil evaporation significantly reduces afternoon scattered precipitation during the development stage (due to suppressed land surface moisture flux under peak solar radiation), while suppressing vegetation transpiration decreases precipitation across all stages (via disrupted moisture supply from stomatal conductance). Canopy evaporation primarily affects precipitation during the mature and dissipation stages (by releasing intercepted water within hours post-precipitation). Increasing evaporation rates enhances precipitation (maximum more than 40 % during the development stage). Crucially, re-evaporation of former precipitation sustains rainfall in mature/dissipation stages (through moisture recycling of precipitation). Sensitivity experiments quantify stage-specific conversions in the water vapor-hydrometeor-precipitation chain and establish a novel conceptual model of precipitation-evaporation feedback, providing the first mechanistic insights into heterogeneous evaporation controls on extreme rainfall in high-altitude “water towers”."

 The expansion of arid lands is one of the most critical environmental threats of the century, driven by climate change and unsustainable human activities. In Brazil, recent climatic shifts suggest an expansion of arid and semi-arid zones beyond the traditionally vulnerable Northeast region. While prior research has emphasized long-term climatological trends focused in that region, this study adopts non-stationary approaches to examine year-by-year aridity class frequencies from 1961 to 2020 across the entirety of Brazil. It also distinguishes the relative influence of precipitation (P) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) on observed aridity index (AI) changes. Our results reveal an expansion of roughly 30 % of dryland conditions across Brazil over the past 30 years, extending beyond the traditionally semi-arid Northeast into the Southeast, and an emerging hotspot in the Pantanal, potentially linked with larger scale South American aridization trends. The increasing annual frequency of arid and semi-arid classifications, particularly in emerging zones, suggests a persistent shift towards drier climates. This pattern seems to be driven primarily by declining P and secondarily by rising PET (temperature). By analyzing annual frequencies, we uncover a creeping aridity process, which directly converses with updated desertification risk assessments and climate adaptation strategies in Brazil, such as the ‘Brazilian Action Plan to Combat Desertification and Mitigate the Effects of Drought’."

 Accurate sunshine duration (SD) estimation is vital for large-scale, dynamic applications, such as agricultural planning, urban development, and solar energy optimization. Ground-based observations, with their sparse stations and limited coverage, often fall short of meeting these requirements. In contrast, satellite-based methods, particularly those utilizing high spatial resolution data, have become increasingly important in addressing these limitations. To address the need for enhanced precision and coverage, this study developed an AI-driven framework using high-resolution Himawari-8 L1 Gridded data for the first time. By integrating multiple machine learning models with a stacked generalization algorithm, the framework enables seamless and highly accurate SD estimation. The proposed method demonstrates significant potential for wide-spread application. Tests conducted in Jiangxi Province China have confirmed its reliability. The model achieved a high R2 of 0.969, with RMSE and MAE of 0.752 and 0.519 h, respectively. We further analyzed the distribution of SD across different land-use types. The results indicate that croplands and forests are predominantly located in areas with longer SD, reflecting the adaptive choices made by human activities and ecosystems in response to sunlight conditions. This finding suggests that SD can serve as a critical reference for the planning of croplands and forestlands. Moreover, it provides robust data support and scientific guidance for future regional land-use optimization, sustainable agricultural development, and renewable energy planning."
