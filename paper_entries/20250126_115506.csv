10.1021/acs.est.4c04931,False,Environmental Science & Technology,这篇论文关注的是塑料污染问题及其可能的市场化解决方案——碳排放交易机制（Cap-and-Trade）。它探讨了将这种机制应用于塑料全生命周期管理的机遇和挑战，包括政策设计中的关键考量，例如材料和目标群体的确定、总量控制和许可证分配以及竞争性市场环境的营造。研究的重点在于政策层面，而非大气环境遥感技术。因此，它与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等，关系不大。,[],Hadeel Al-Zawaidah;Marlene Kammerer;Denise M. Mitrano;Kryss Waldschläger,Opportunities and Challenges of a Cap-and-Trade System for Plastics,"Recently, the rapid increase in global plastics production has caused various ecological and economic issues, worsened by poor material and waste management. Among the market-based instruments that could help mitigate the environmental impacts of plastics throughout their life-cycle, we evaluate the advantages and limitations of incorporating a cap-and-trade (CAT) system into future policy mixes. Our aim is to inspire further investigation of CAT’s feasibility rather than presenting it as the ultimate solution. Drawing from past CAT implementations in domains such as water resource management and carbon emissions, we outline three key policy design considerations: (1) material and target group identification, (2) cap establishment and permit allocation, and (3) development of a competitive market environment. We explore a three-tiered approach with global, national, and sectoral caps covering the plastic lifecycle from cradle to grave. While there are viable reasons to consider a plastics CAT, significant challenges persist, which may ultimately limit its implementation. In the context of ongoing UN Plastics Treaty negotiations or future policy developments, this evaluation of CAT can be beneficial for assessing when and how this tool can address the negative externalities of plastics."
10.1021/acs.est.4c08090,True,Environmental Science & Technology,这篇论文研究了植被火灾排放物对青藏高原冰川融化的影响。研究发现，植被火灾释放的大量光吸收成分会加剧冰川融化，尤其是在植被火灾高发期（季风型冰川为3-5月，西风型冰川为6-10月）。论文利用卫星观测等遥感技术，分析了1997年以来青藏高原冰川融化与火灾碳排放量之间的关系，发现两者之间存在显著的正相关关系。这表明，除了气候变暖外，加剧的火灾碳排放也可能加速青藏高原冰川融化和质量损失，尤其是在传统非融化月份。论文强调需要重新评估火灾碳排放对青藏高原冰川变化的影响，因为非融化月份的融水会改变淡水资源供应模式，而气候变暖导致高海拔地区野火风险增加。,"['Light-absorbing components', 'Carbon emissions', 'Satellite observations', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Atmospheric composition analysis', 'Glacier melting', 'Wildfire emissions']",Chao You;Jing Wang;Renping Lin;Chao Xu,Vegetation Fire Emissions Exacerbate Glacier Melting on the Third Pole,"Vegetation fires release a large fraction of light-absorbing components, which can contribute to the melting of snowpack and alpine glaciers. However, the relationship between variability in fire emissions and alpine glacier melting on the Third Pole (TP) remains poorly understood. This study provides evidence that carbon emissions from windward vegetation fires play a crucial role in comprehending glacier melting on the TP, particularly during the months of intense vegetation fires from March to May for monsoon-dominated glaciers and from June to October for westerlies-dominated glaciers. Furthermore, robust positive correlations (with p < 0.05) have been observed since 1997 across the TP between variations in glacier melting and fire carbon emissions during both annual periods and those intense fire months. In addition to climate warming, intensified fire carbon emissions could potentially accelerate the melting and mass loss of TP glaciers, especially during those traditionally nonmelting months. An urgent reassessment of the impact of fire carbon emissions on changes in TP glaciers is necessary, given that meltwater during traditionally nonmelting months can reshape freshwater resource supply patterns, and the projected increased wildfire risk in high mountainous regions in a rapidly warming climate."
10.1021/acs.est.4c08360,True,Environmental Science & Technology,这篇论文研究了在华南沿海地区，白天氯分子(Cl2)对空气质量的影响。研究发现，酸性环境下，颗粒物硝酸盐的光解会产生大量的Cl2，进而释放出高活性的氯自由基(Cl·)，这在目前的化学传输模型中通常被低估。研究人员将Cl2的生成参数化引入区域模型，结果显示该模型能够较好地模拟沿海地区Cl2的浓度。模拟结果表明，大量的Cl2改变了大气氧化能力，导致高NOx区域O3和PM2.5浓度增加，而在低NOx区域O3浓度降低。这表明，控制NOx和SO2的排放，可以减少Cl·的生成，从而改善空气质量。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它关注的是大气成分(O3、PM2.5、Cl2、Cl·)的分析以及空气质量监测，并通过模型模拟来研究污染物传输和转化过程。,"['air quality', 'ozone (O3)', 'particulate matter (PM2.5)', 'chlorine radicals (Cl·)', 'molecular chlorine (Cl2)', 'air pollution', 'chemical transport model', 'emission control', 'NOx', 'SO2', 'coastal air quality']",Jianing Dai;Tao Wang;Hengqing Shen;Men Xia;Weihang Sun;Guy P. Brasseur,Significant Impact of a Daytime Halogen Oxidant on Coastal Air Quality,"Chlorine radicals (Cl·) are highly reactive and affect the fate of air pollutants. Several field studies in China have revealed elevated levels of daytime molecular chlorine (Cl2), which, upon photolysis, release substantial amounts of Cl· but are poorly represented in current chemical transport models. Here, we implemented a parametrization for the formation of daytime Cl2 through the photodissociation of particulate nitrate in acidic environments into a regional model and assessed its impact on coastal air quality during autumn in South China. The model could reproduce over 70% of the high Cl2 level measured at a coastal site, revealing a discernible presence of Cl2 and released Cl· in coastal and adjacent areas. Abundant Cl2 alters the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere, consequently increasing O3 (6–12%) and PM2.5 (10–16%) concentrations in high-NOx areas and reducing O3 (3%) concentration in low-NOx areas. Accounting for chlorine chemistry shifts the O3 – precursor relationships from VOC limited to mixed or NOx -limited regimes, enhancing the benefits of NOx emission reduction in mitigating O3 pollution. Our findings suggest that tightening emission control for two acidic pollutants, NOx and SO2, would alleviate reactive Cl· production and its adverse impact on air quality."
10.1021/acs.est.4c09001,False,Environmental Science & Technology,该研究主要关注低强度火灾对东北地区永久冻土泥炭地土壤有机碳组成和稳定性的影响。研究通过为期三年的低强度火烧实验，分析了重复低强度火烧对土壤碳稳定性的长期影响，发现火烧导致土壤总碳含量逐渐下降，主要是因为游离颗粒有机质（fPOM）减少。虽然火烧初期增加了fPOM，但随着重复燃烧而减少。化学分析表明，燃烧地块fPOM的芳香性增加了32%，降低了土壤的热稳定性。此外，火烧和焦炭的加入都降低了生物稳定性，增加了酶活性和CO2产量。研究结果表明，低强度火烧会影响永久冻土泥炭地的稳定性，特别是焦炭的输入会改变土壤碳组分的化学组成。该研究主要集中在土壤碳循环和生态系统方面，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等。,[],Guangxin Li;Long Sun;Haiqing Hu;Shengzhen Ji;Tongxin Hu;Jinxin Cong;Dongxue Han;Chuanyu Gao,Effects of Low-Severity Fire on the Composition and Stability of Soil Organic Carbon in Permafrost Peatlands (Northeast China),"Climate change and human activity are increasing the frequency of wildfires in peatlands and threatening permafrost peatland carbon pools. In Northeast China, low-severity prescribed fires are conducted annually on permafrost peatlands to reduce the risk of wildfires. These fires typically do not burn surface peat but lead to the loss of surface vegetation and introduction of pyrogenic carbon. However, the long-term effects of repeated low-severity fires on soil carbon stability in these ecosystems remain unclear. Thus, we conducted low-severity prescribed fire experiments over 3 years in the permafrost peatlands of the Great Khingan Mountains. Our findings showed a gradual decline in the total carbon content, primarily due to the reduction in free particulate organic matter (fPOM). Initially, fPOM was higher in the burned sites but decreased with repeated burning. Chemical analyses revealed a 32% increase in the aromaticity of the fPOM at the burned sites, which diminished the thermal stability of the soil. Furthermore, both prescribed fires and the addition of pyrogenic carbon reduced biological stability while increasing enzyme activity and CO2 production, which was attributed to the introduction of post-fire pyrogenic carbon. These results suggest that low-severity fires compromise the stability of permafrost peatlands, particularly because the pyrogenic carbon input alters the chemical composition of the soil carbon fraction."

Champion;Guofeng Shen;Craig Williams;Larry Virtaranta;Mark Barnes;Cara Christianson;Michael D. Hays;James J. Jetter,Evaluating the Laboratory Performance of Pellet-Fueled Semigasifier Cookstoves,"This study examines three representative semigasifier cookstove models each burning four types of pelletized-biomass fuel (hardwood, peanut hull, rice husk, and wheat straw) using the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 19867-1:2018 protocol. ISO tier ratings for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions ranged 1–4 and 2–5 (where 5 = cleanest), respectively, suggesting that pellet-fueled cookstoves may provide substantial emissions reductions, dependent upon stove/fuel matching and operation, over other biomass-fueled cooking alternatives. PM2.5 emission factors based on useful energy delivered (EFd) varied by up to 25-fold, and organic and elemental carbon (OC and EC) EFd values respectively varied by >200- and ∼100-fold, reflecting complex variability in PM2.5 composition. These semigasifier cookstoves showed higher ultrafine particle (UFP) emissions but lower bulk PM2.5 emissions. Operation of pellet-fueled cookstoves at higher firepower resulted in higher PM2.5 and UFP emission factors and higher EC-to-total-carbon ratios; operation at lower firepower resulted in higher gaseous pollutant emission factors. Results of this work provide technical guidance for stove developers, users, and policy-makers. These ISO-protocol-based emission factors are also pertinent to health and climate modeling efforts."
10.1021/acs.est.4c11647,True,Environmental Science & Technology,这篇论文研究了科西嘉岛地区HONO的来源及其在大气氧化能力中的作用。研究发现，白天HONO浓度较低，夜间较高，这与以往的认识不同。通过夜间HONO收支分析，发现气团沿山坡传输过程中HONO显著增加。白天，虽然光敏NO2吸收和NO+OH反应贡献较大，但仍有很大一部分HONO的形成原因无法解释。研究推测，光敏非均相NO2反应可能是缺失源，因为在低NO2浓度下，典型参数化低估了该来源。此外，研究表明HONO的形成对该岛屿地区的OH自由基生成有重要作用，其OH生成速率超过O3光解的四分之一。该研究结果强调了非均相表面反应在岛屿环境大气氧化能力中的潜在作用。虽然文章主要基于地面观测数据，但其研究结果对于改进大气化学模型，特别是岛屿环境大气氧化能力的模拟具有重要意义，也为相关的卫星遥感反演提供了重要的地面验证数据。,"['Nitrous acid (HONO)', 'Atmospheric oxidation capacity', 'Heterogeneous reactions', 'Ground-based measurements', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Island environments']",Chaoyang Xue;Hui Chen;Max R.

Herein, based on comprehensive field measurements at a hilltop on Corsica Island, we find an inverse diel variation of HONO with higher concentrations during daytime. Night-time HONO budget analysis indicates significant HONO formation during air mass transport along the hillside. In the daytime, although photosensitized NO2 uptake on the ground and NO + OH make considerable contributions (26% and 5%, respectively), a large part of HONO formation (67%, 320 pptv h–1) still cannot be explained with state-of-the-art parametrization. Nevertheless, photosensitized heterogeneous NO2 reactions are likely to account for the missing source, due to underestimation of the source by typical parametrizations at low NO2 levels. Furthermore, we demonstrate a significant role of HONO formation as a OH primary source at this island site, with a OH production rate exceeding one-fourth of that of O3 photolysis. Our findings underscore a potential role of heterogeneous surface reactions in the oxidizing capacity of the island environments."

However, the performance loss due to using RAP in the asphalt binder layer often requires a thicker layer, leading to additional material usage, energy consumption, and transportation effort. In this study, we developed a parametric and probabilistic life cycle assessment (LCA) framework to robustly compare various pavement designs incorporating recycled materials. Our framework is built upon thermodynamic and physical principles to reveal the complex relationship among the parameters. Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) models and Highway Development Management (HDM4) models are integrated into the framework to estimate pavement roughness and vehicle fuel consumption during the use phase. The pedigree approach and Monte Carlo simulation are integrated into the framework to reflect data uncertainty at the parameter level. We applied the framework to evaluate 66 Flemish motorway segments, revealing that using RAP in the binder layer with increased thickness does not necessarily guarantee lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for pavement construction. However, it may lead to lower GHG emissions due to fuel savings when considering the use phase, highlighting the vital role of the use phase in pavement LCA. Our global sensitivity analysis highlights several contributors (out of 87 parameters) to GHG emissions variance depending on the LCA scope: fuel consumption during the use phase, transport distances, mass of fine aggregate, and machine power and machine productivity during pavement construction. Reducing uncertainties in these parameters can decrease the variance by up to 60%, enhancing discernibility by up to 11%. In conclusion, our parametric and probabilistic LCA framework provides a nuanced understanding when comparing various pavement designs incorporating recycled content, enabling robust decision-making through improved data quality."

Hence, there is a need to represent these widely varying kinetic processes in large-scale atmospheric models to allow for accurate predictions of the abundance, properties, and impacts of SOA. In this work, we integrated a kinetic, process-level model (simpleSOM-MOSAIC) into a weather-chemistry model (WRF-Chem) to simulate the oxidation chemistry and microphysics of atmospheric SOA. simpleSOM-MOSAIC simulates multigenerational gas-phase chemistry, autoxidation reactions, aqueous chemistry, heterogeneous oxidation, oligomerization, and phase-state-influenced gas/particle partitioning of SOA. As a case study, the integrated WRF-Chem-simpleSOM-MOSAIC (WC-SSM) model was used to simulate the photochemical evolution downwind of a large city (Manaus, Brazil) in the Amazon and, in turn, study the anthropogenic and biogenic interactions in an otherwise pristine environment. Consistent with previous work, we found that OA was enhanced by up to a factor of 4 in the urban plume due to elevated hydroxyl radical (OH) concentrations, relative to the background, and that this OA was dominated by SOA from biogenic precursors (80%). In addition to accurately simulating the OA enhancement in the urban plume, the model reproduced the magnitude of the OA oxygen-to-carbon (O:C) ratio and broadly tracked the evolution of the aerosol number size distribution.

We calculate CSD indicators for simulations across varying parameter regimes, investigating the system's steady‐state dynamical structure and its evolution under gradual climate forcing. We find that the modeled AMOC features bistability for relatively weak gyre salinity exchange, but no bistability when the gyres are sufficiently strong. However, CSD indicators consistently warn of a collapse across the gyre strength parameter space, even when no bifurcations occur, thus raising false alarms. We argue that CSD should be applied cautiously in systems where the dynamical structure and physical response to forcing are not fully known (such as the AMOC), specifically where it is not a priori clear whether the system is in a multistable regime."

However, factors other than aridity can impact dust production rate. We present here an integrated environmental magnetic, electron microscopic, sedimentologic, and geochemical investigation of eolian dust records from Northwest Pacific Ocean Drilling Program Hole 1207A between 1.0 and 1.5 Ma. Reconstructed fluxes of bulk eolian dust and illite, the predominant clay mineral (>72% proportion), are both higher and lower during glacials and interglacials, respectively. Lower illite chemical index values reflect stronger physical weathering during glacials. We attribute eolian flux peaks to increased availability of wind‐erodible particles caused by enhanced physical weathering in dust source areas due to strengthened Asian interior glacial activity in response to glacial cooling. This evidence demonstrates that Northwest Pacific eolian flux does not only reflect persistent Asian interior aridity on orbital timescales."

This approach has the advantage of being independent of paleogeographic reconstructions. However, it does not provide information on the spatial distribution of thermal heterogeneities at the core‐mantle boundary. This likely explains why the long‐term evolution of global subduction flux does not correlate in any simple way with the frequency of geomagnetic polarity reversals throughout the Phanerozoic. As an additional parameter, we suggest focusing on how variations in the Earth's inertia, due to changing subduction configurations over time, influence the thermal conditions at the core‐mantle boundary and, consequently, the magnetic reversal frequency."

Above 105 km, the global mean ΔT had values of ≥20 K in the early morning and of ≥15 K in the late afternoon during storm‐time. At high latitudes, the storm‐time ΔT was larger in the late afternoon than in the early morning. This is opposite to that at middle and low latitudes.

Results show that southwestern forests exhibit the highest annual carbon sink capacity, while the establishment of national forest parks has contributed positively to enhancing the carbon sink capacity of northern forests. Substantial uncertainties in NEE evaluation were observed, largely due to variations in scales and thresholds. Our findings highlight the importance of site‐scale assessments in evaluating the carbon sink capacity and informing targeted strategies for China's dual‐carbon goals.

The special thermodynamic structure above the lens of MWEs, which would favor the TC‐induced entrainment more efficiently, facilitates the elevation of substantial subsurface cold water. It also leads to increased mixed‐layer salinity and deepening of the mixed‐layer. Additionally, variations in nitrate and chlorophyll‐a concentrations appear to be depressed and exhibit intricate multi‐layer patterns due to TC‐induced and MWE‐influenced vertical processes.

This study explores the impacts of plant responses on hydrological cycling at 2x preindustrial CO2 concentrations by analyzing simulations that isolate plant physiological effects using the Community Earth System Model versions 1 and 2.

These leaf area impacts are also evident in the differences between CESM1 and CESM2, with CESM2 better capturing observed leaf area magnitudes but potentially overestimating leaf area‐CO2 sensitivity, highlighting the importance of plant CO2 physiology on hydrological cycle changes and the need to improve its representation in climate models."

This study aims to identify and compare characteristics and mechanisms of intraseasonal precipitation in these two regions using daily observational data. Our results indicate their notable differences in atmospheric circulations and dynamical processes, despite similarities in moisture sources. A wave train associated with the intraseasonal precipitation in the western North Pacific characterized by anomalous cyclones and anticyclones from West Siberia into the North Pacific is observed, accompanied by anomalous wave activity. By diagnosing local finite‐amplitude wave activity (LWA) budget, we demonstrate that the baroclinic eddy generation initiates the upstream growth of wave activity, whereas its downstream development is primarily attributed to the zonal advection of wave train. The upstream wave train induces barotropic and baroclinic instabilities in Kuroshio‐Oyashio extension (KOE). In contrast, the anomalous atmospheric circulations related to intraseasonal precipitation in the eastern North Pacific feature a tripolar structure, with downstream propagation of wave activity from the eastern North Pacific to the North American continent. Diabatic heating, along with local eddy generation, contributes to the upstream growth of wave activity. Residual term, possibly linked to the wave activity dissipation associated with wave breaking, extends the wave activity downstream. Thermal and baroclinic instabilities, associated with the diabatic heating and local eddy generation, create favorable conditions for the precipitation.

The activity of boreal‐winter MJO realization is quantified by the number of MJO active days during the tracking of the real‐time multivariate MJO index. In active years of MJO realization (MJO‐A), multiple MJOs are initiated in the Indian Ocean (IO) and they propagate into the western Pacific (WP), but not so in inactive years (MJO‐IA). This contrast is explained by whether vertical moisture advection over the WP is disrupted or not. It is related to differences in boreal‐winter mean convection and circulations: MJO‐A (MJO‐IA) years are characterized by enhanced and suppressed (suppressed and enhanced) convection over the WP/IO and Maritime Continent (MC), respectively. This modulation results from combined effects of the El Niño‐Southern oscillation (ENSO) and quasi‐biennial oscillation (QBO). During moderate‐to‐strong El Niño, MJO is realized actively irrespective of QBO, if no additional convective suppression over the eastern IO and/or MC due to other forcing such as a positive Indian Ocean Dipole mode. During other ENSO phases, stronger QBO‐easterly phases favor MJO realization irrespective of ENSO. This QBO–MJO connection except for El Niño conditions is due to zonally heterogeneous QBO impacts that the seasonal mean static stability change near the tropopause over the WP alters the mean convective activity there. This zonal heterogeneity and ENSO phase‐dependency of QBO impacts is interpreted with a focus on vertical propagation of Kelvin wave structure over the MC, affected by both QBO winds and background Walker circulations."

In this study, we examine the projected future changes in winter‐time ETCs over South Africa (SA) using simulations from CORDEX‐CORE Africa. We utilized three regional climate models, each driven by three different global climate models that simulate both the current climate and a future climate experiencing strong human‐induced warming. From these, we assess changes in ETC frequency, track density, intensity, storm severity, and associated rainfall. The results indicate a significant reduction in the aggregate ETC frequency and track density, although track density is projected to increase prominently along the western coastal regions. Models show mixed trends in cyclone intensity projections, but overall results indicate weaker future cyclones, with reduced peak relative vorticity and increased minimum sea level pressure. Examining the Meteorological Storm Severity Index reveals notable regional variations in future storm severity. Average rainfall associated with ETCs is projected to decrease across SA, especially around Cape Town, highlighting a potential shift in the spatial distribution of rainfall with substantial consequences for water supply. We further investigated extreme ETCs (EETCs) and found that the trends for EETCs are generally similar to those for ETCs, with a notable decrease in frequency and regional variations in storm severity. These findings underscore the importance of developing targeted adaptation strategies to address the projected impacts of future ETCs on SA's climate and communities."

Its temperature-dependent Clapeyron slope helps explain the diverse behavior of slabs and plumes worldwide. 
 Phase transitions in the mantle control its internal dynamics and structure. The post-spinel transition marks the upper–lower mantle boundary, where ringwoodite dissociates into bridgmanite plus ferropericlase, and its Clapeyron slope regulates mantle flow across it. This interaction has previously been assumed to have no lateral spatial variations, based on the assumption of a linear post-spinel boundary in pressure and temperature. Here we present laser-heated diamond anvil cell experiments with synchrotron X-ray diffraction to better constrain this boundary, especially at higher temperatures. Combining our data with results from the literature, and using a global analysis based on machine learning, we find a pronounced nonlinearity in the post-spinel boundary, with its slope ranging from –4 MPa/K at 2100 K, to –2 MPa/K at 1950 K, and to 0 MPa/K at 1600 K. Changes in temperature over time and space can therefore cause the post-spinel transition to have variable effects on mantle convection and the movement of subducting slabs and upwelling plumes.

Here, the authors propose a quantum computing architecture combining superconducting cat qubits with 2D local LDPC codes, featuring low overhead and ease of implementation. 
 The main obstacle to large scale quantum computing are the errors present in every physical qubit realization. Correcting these errors requires a large number of additional qubits. Two main avenues to reduce this overhead are (i) low-density parity check (LDPC) codes requiring very few additional qubits to correct errors (ii) cat qubits where bit-flip errors are exponentially suppressed by design. In this work, we combine both approaches to obtain an extremely low overhead architecture. Assuming a physical phase-flip error probability ϵ ≈ 0.1% per qubit and operation, one hundred logical qubits can be implemented on a 758 cat qubit chip, with a total logical error probability per cycle and per logical qubit ϵL ≤ 10−8. Our architecture also features two major advantages. First, the hardware implementation of the code can be realised with short-range qubit interactions in 2D and low-weight stabilizers, under constraints similar to those of the popular surface code architecture. Second, we demonstrate how to implement a fault-tolerant universal set of logical gates with an additional layer of routing cat qubits stacked on top of the LDPC layer, while maintaining the local connectivity. Furthermore, our architecture benefits from a high capacity of parallelization for these logical gates. Implementing full quantum error correction incurs a significant hardware overhead.

 The controlled growth of two-dimensional (2D) perovskite atop three-dimensional (3D) perovskite films reduces interfacial recombination and impedes ion migration, thus improving the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Unfortunately, the random orientation of the spontaneously formed 2D phase atop the pre-deposited 3D perovskite film can deteriorate charge extraction owing to energetic disorder, limiting the maximum attainable efficiency and long-term stability of the PSCs.

 Hydrous aluminosilicates are important deep water-carriers in sediments subducting into the deep mantle. To date, it remains enigmatic how hydrous aluminosilicates withstand extremely high temperatures in the mantle transition zone. Here we systematically investigate the crystal structures and chemical compositions of typical hydrous aluminosilicates using single-crystal X-ray diffraction, electron probe microanalyzer, and nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry. These single crystals are synthesized at 15.5–22.0 GPa and 1400–1700 °C, featuring pervasive structural disorders. In particular, Al and Si atoms extensively occupy new tetrahedral and octahedral sites that are nominally vacant in their ordered counterparts. High temperature activates disorders leading to variable local crystal structures and more hydrogen incorporation into the crystal structure. This result suggests that the order-to-disorder transition holds the key to the high thermal stability of hydrous aluminosilicates, significantly affecting the water cycle in the deep mantle.

 Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a malignant lymphoproliferative disorder for which primary or acquired drug resistance represents a major challenge. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we generate a mouse model of ibrutinib resistance, in which, after initial treatment response, relapse under therapy occurrs with an aggressive outgrowth of malignant cells, resembling observations in patients. A comparative analysis of exome, transcriptome and proteome of sorted leukemic murine cells during treatment and after relapse suggests alterations in the proteasome activity as a driver of ibrutinib resistance. Preclinical treatment with the irreversible proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib administered upon ibrutinib resistance prolongs survival of mice. Longitudinal proteomic analysis of ibrutinib-resistant patients identifies deregulation in protein post-translational modifications. Additionally, cells from ibrutinib-resistant patients effectively respond to several proteasome inhibitors in co-culture assays. Altogether, our results from orthogonal omics approaches identify proteasome inhibition as potentially attractive treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients resistant or refractory to ibrutinib.

 The Kumalak River, a typical alpine glacierized catchment in the Tianshan region, experiences complex flooding driven by glacier meltwater, snowmelt, and rainfall.

To address this, a SWAT-Glacier hydrological model and a degree–day factor model were used for snowmelt, glacier meltwater, and rainfall calculations. Two Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models (LSTM-SG and LSTM-DDF) were developed using these inputs, and additive decomposition and integrated gradient methods were applied to interpret flood mechanisms. Glacier meltwater was found to dominate annual maximum flood (AMF) events, while snowmelt drove annual spring maximum flood (AMFSp) events. For AMF events (1960–2018), contributions were 10.01–12.21% from snowmelt, 60.49–60.92% from glacier meltwater, and 26.86–29.50% from rainfall.

 Coral reef restoration can reduce the wave-driven flooding for coastal communities. However, this protection has yet to be assessed in terms of the reduced risk of flood-driven environmental contamination. Here we provide the first high-resolution valuation of the reduction of flood-related land-based environmental pollution provided by potential coral reef restoration. Along Florida’s 460 km-long coral reef-fringed coastline, coral reef restoration could reduce the risk of sewage and petrochemical contamination by preventing the flooding of petroleum storage tank systems (-9%), onsite sewage treatment and disposal systems (-4%), and wastewater treatment plants (-10%). The present value of critical infrastructure protection and contamination prevention benefits provided by coral reef restoration is $3,413,503, with some areas exceeding $1,500,000/km. Annually, 48,403 U.S. gal of petrochemicals, 10,404 GPD of wastewater treatment capacity, equivalent to $281,435, could be protected from flooding, demonstrating that coral reef restoration can provide environmental risk reduction and previously undocumented additional socioeconomic benefits.

 The early evolution of the South Atlantic Ocean following the Cretaceous break-up of Gondwana is extensively recorded in rift basins along the conjugate margins of Africa and Brazil. For the Brazil side, divergent views of the source and pathway of the initial seawater incursion persist due to a paucity of recognized transitional sequences that document marine transgressive deposits over the continental interior. To address this, we conducted a high-resolution sedimentological and geochemical study through a core in the Campos Basin that encompasses the key lithologic switch from lacustrine carbonate to marine evaporite settings. Steroid lipid biomarkers, derived from pelagophyte marine algae, make a striking appearance in concert with a pronounced negative shift of 87Sr/86Sr ratios and coincident with the appearance of anhydrite. Importantly, the sulfur-sequestered biomarkers reveal a dynamic system where redox-stratified and anoxic conditions were amplified along with a deepening chemocline through the marine transition.

 ICESat-2 provides the potential for high-resolution and accurate measurements of the sea ice state. However, the current ATL07 sea ice height and type product relies on a threshold method for surface type classification, which introduces uncertainties in lead detection, especially in summer. In addition, it only categorizes into sea ice and lead types, excluding gray ice and the dark lead category has been shown to misclassify leads in cloudy conditions. To address these issues, we seek to improve the surface type classification by combining unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods and leveraging coincident imagery obtained from Sentinel-2. First, we use an unsupervised Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with four statistical parameters—photon rate, background rate, width of distribution, and height—to group ATL07 segments into 80 clusters. These clusters are then assigned specific surface types—sea ice, gray ice, or lead—based on coincident Sentinel-2 imagery. In the second step, we train a supervised K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classification model using the labeled segments from the GMM as training data. We conduct Leave One Group Out cross-validation of our model using coincident Sentinel-2 images as the ground truth, analyzing 717,009 strong beam and 702,843 weak beam ATL07 segments. The results demonstrate an improvement in lead detection, with precision values reaching approximately 98.6 % for strong beams and 97.5 % for weak beams and recall values of 91.8 % for strong beams and 90.3 % for weak beams. Our approach is applied to both Antarctic and Arctic sea ice, and is extended to include a new gray ice category, which agrees reasonably well with the coincident Sentinel-2 images. Our new sea ice and lead classification approach shows great promise for improving sea surface height and sea ice freeboard retrievals from ICESat-2 and highlights the significant value of coincident satellite imagery for classification training and validation."

 Coastal bathymetry is of great significance to the development and protection of islands and reefs. Traditional ship-based sonar bathymetry and airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) bathymetry make it difficult to efficiently map the water depth of remote islands and reefs. Notably, the photon-counting LiDAR on board ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2) has the capability of shallow water bathymetry. However, the photon data acquired by this instrument is contaminated with substantial noise of varying density. In this study, a sliding window-based coastal bathymetric method (SWCBM-Ph) is proposed for photon data with variable density. Experiments are carried out on six island coasts as an example, and the results show that the method is effective in extracting underwater terrain photons for bathymetry, with RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of 0.60 m and 0.53 m on low- and high-density photon datasets separately within water depth of 30 m. Compared with existing bathymetry methods, the SWCBM-Ph is less affected by noise signals, and adapts to variations in photon density, including diversities between different datasets and within the same dataset. Therefore, the proposed method helps to improve the stability of spaceborne photon bathymetry for complex situations in coastal waters."

 Mongolia in northeastern Asia encounters severe atmospheric particulate matter (PM) pollution during winter. Although many researchers have investigated PM haze in Mongolia using filter sample analyses to understand its formation mechanisms and sources, the formation and growth of atmospheric PM in Mongolia are currently unknown because of the deficiency of real-time measurements of particle size distributions. In this study, the number size distributions of atmospheric particles (PNSDs) in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, were measured over a year using real-time aerosol instruments to better understand the formation and growth of atmospheric PM at different timescales using meteorological data. The diurnal variations in PNSDs in different seasons had similar patterns, but different particle number concentrations (PNCs). A weak new particle formation (NPF) in the daytime was observed only in summer under the cleanest air quality of the year. In winter, the PNSD exhibited 4–11 times higher PNC than that in the other seasons. The highest PNCs in winter were strongly correlated with the primary particles produced by combustion such as that in heating and power generation. In addition, the PNCs at nighttime were generally higher than those during the daytime, with larger modal sizes throughout the year. In terms of particle size ranges, Aitken- and accumulation-mode particles (which are detrimental to human health) were dominant in the number and volume size distributions of particles, respectively. The diurnal variations in PNC displayed dual peaks in the morning and late evening. This matched the primary particle emissions from traffic and coal/biomass burning. The nitrate-to-sulfate ratios revealed that stationary sources mainly contributed to high PM concentrations throughout the year except in summer. The significant Pearson correlation coefficients between particles and gaseous pollutants also supported primary particle emissions through combustion in winter."

 Organic matter is often the largest contributor to PM2.5, but its emission sources and formation pathways are very diverse, making it challenging to identify the causes of high concentration episodes. In this study, four groups of organic compounds that contribute to PM2.5, including sugars, dicarboxylic acids (DA), fatty acids (FA), and pinonic acid (PNA) were measured in a medium-sized residential city in South Korea during three seasons, where high PM2.5 concentration episodes often occur. The average concentrations of PM2.5 and total quantified organic matter (∑17 qOM) was 21 ± 12 μg m−3 and 391 ± 183 ng m−3, respectively. The concentration of ∑sugars was higher during the colder seasons compared to the warm season (32 ± 18 ng m−3, 240 ± 109 ng m−3, and 231 ± 105 ng m−3 in the warm, transition, and cold seasons, respectively). In contrast, ∑DAs exhibited the opposite seasonal trend (234 ± 164 ng m−3, 114 ± 103 ng m−3, and 140 ± 103 ng m−3 in the warm, transition, and cold seasons, respectively). The contribution of ∑FA to qOM was relatively consistent (13.1% in warm season to 15.6% in colder seasons). PNA, a biogenic secondary organic aerosol tracer, had a significantly higher concentration during the warm season (16 ± 13 ng m−3 in warm season vs. 3 ± 3 ng m−3 in colder seasons). A strong correlation between ∑sugars and ∑FAs (r = 0.72) was observed only in the transition season, when crop residue burning was determined to be important. Unsaturated FAs were likely to be efficiently aged during the cold season since the ratio of C18:0 to C18:1, a tracer for the age of aerosol, increased. DAs were generally dominant in the warm season, but also significantly increased during most high PM2.5 concentration episodes (HCEs; 306 ± 199 ng m−3), which primarily occurred in the colder season. During HCEs appearing in colder season, the ratio of malonic acid (C3) to succinic acid (C4), a tracer for photochemical aging of air masses, also increased, suggesting that the secondary aerosol formation and aerosol aging significantly enhanced PM2.5 concentration."

 Wind-blown dust can affect the acidity of all particles, impacting a series of related chemical processes. In this work, we use a wind-blown dust emissions model along with the hybrid version of aerosol dynamics in the PMCAMx chemical transport model to quantify the effects of dust on size-resolved aerosol pH over the U.S during February and July 2017 as a function of altitude. The version of the model used can capture the most important range of pH values (less than 5), while particles that are more alkaline than this threshold are assumed to have pH equal to 5. Our simulations indicate that wind-blown dust can increase ground level PM1 pH up to 1 unit during wintertime and up to 3.5 units during summertime in the western U.S. For PM1−2.5, the corresponding increases are higher during wintertime (up to 1.5 units) and a little lower during summertime (up to 3 units) compared to PM1. For coarse particles (PM2.5−5 and PM5−10), the impact of wind-blown dust is predicted to be lower since in most areas the corresponding pH is already quite high due to the presence of dust from anthropogenic activities (e.g., agriculture, resuspension due to traffic). The impact of wind-blown dust on aerosol acidity decreases with altitude for PM1 mainly because of the reduction of aerosol water. On the other hand, for PM1−2.5, the predicted effect increases with altitude due to the lower pH at higher altitudes. PM1 and PM1−2.5 acidity can be affected significantly by wind-blown dust for both simulated periods impacting at the same time secondary aerosol formation, emissions control strategies, solubility of metals, and nitrogen deposition."

 Understanding the effects of human occupancy and ventilation on indoor air quality, especially in the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), is crucial for human health. We investigated VOC concentrations in an office environment with varying occupancy and ventilation in real-time via proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry by evaluating conditions across different ventilation control scenarios. Among the 276 analyzed species, 113 VOCs were quantified, where 77.8% of the total emission rate is attributed to human occupancy, 12.9% to building sources, and 9.30% to supply air. The emissions rates of occupants and building were quantified by considering natural ventilation (Q = 117.36 m3 h−1) in the emission source, which increased their emission rate by 31.5%. A decrease in the ventilation recirculation ratio (RR = 0.5) reduced the total concentration of indoor VOCs by 55.1% owing to the introduction of fresh ambient air. Notably, daytime measurements with the half-open damper of the ventilation system highlighted the importance of controlled ventilation in mitigating VOC presence. Our findings suggest that considering natural ventilation is important in assessing indoor air quality, that HVAC system management is crucial in enhancing indoor air quality, and that building design and operational strategies must be optimized for the health of indoor environments."

 Aerosols can affect the lightning activity through radiative and microphysical effects. This study attempts to reveal the distinct impact pathways of these two effects on lightning activity. Using data of cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning, aerosol optical depth (AOD), thermodynamic, and cloud-related variables during the summer (June, July, and August) of 2010–2018 in the Sichuan Basin, we investigate the changes in the diurnal variation of lightning activity characteristics between polluted (2010−2013) and clean (2015–2018) years. Polluted years exhibit more thunderstorms during the late afternoon and early evening hours than clean years, but show no significant differences in other time periods. During all time periods, thunderstorms in polluted years are more intense, with a higher CG lightning density. Aerosols exhibit more intense radiative effect during afternoon and early evening hours in polluted years, which reduces the surface temperature, thereby enhancing atmospheric stability and inhibiting the formation of convection. The cloud liquid water and cloud ice water content in polluted years are higher, suggesting stronger aerosol microphysical effects. These results indicate that the radiative effect of aerosols primarily influences lightning activity by altering the frequency of thunderstorms, whereas the microphysical effect of aerosols predominantly affects lightning activity by modulating the intensity of thunderstorms."

10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.107951,True,Atmospheric Research,这篇论文研究了生物质燃烧烟雾中水溶性有机物（BBS-WSOMs）的光吸收特性，以及不同类型生物质（木本和草本）和燃烧温度对其光吸收的影响。研究发现，草本来源的BBS-WSOMs光吸收能力强于木本来源的，并且不同类型的化合物对不同波长范围的光吸收贡献不同。草本来源的BBS-WSOMs中，低分子量、高芳香性的CHO化合物以及CHON化合物分别负责其在200-300nm和365-550nm波段的光吸收；而木本来源的BBS-WSOMs中，CHO/CHOS化合物负责其在365-550nm波段的光吸收。该研究结果对于理解大气中光吸收过程，改进大气环境遥感技术，例如卫星观测和空气质量监测模型，具有重要意义。因为准确测量和模拟生物质燃烧产生的气溶胶的光学特性，对于评估其对气候和空气质量的影响至关重要。,"['Biomass burning', 'Aerosols', 'Light absorption', 'UV-Vis spectroscopy', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Atmospheric composition', 'Water-soluble organic matter']",Weifeng Chen;Huiying Zhang;Shiming Xu;Hui Jia;Zhichong Qi;Usman Farooq;Zhigeng Wang;Qin Dai,New insights into the molecular characteristics-dependent light absorption variation of water-soluble organic matter in biomass burning smoke,"•Herb-derived BBS-WSOM has stronger light absorption than wood-derived BBS-WSOM. •CHO/CHOS compounds in wood-derived BBS-WSOM are responsible for its light absorption. •Low mass and high aromaticity CHO compounds benefit for shortwave light absorption. •CHON compounds control the visible light absorption of herb-derived BBS-WSOM. •The light absorption with increasing wavelength changes with the molecular structures. 
 Forest fire (mainly wood burning) and crop residue burning (mainly herb burning) are two ways to produce biomass burning smoke water-soluble organic matters (BBS-WSOMs), largely altering atmospheric light absorption. However, their molecular characteristics-dependent light absorption remains unknown. Hence, this study combined Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) analysis with UV–Vis spectrum to deeply investigate the different molecules-dependent light absorption of wood- and herb-derived BBS-WSOMs from different burning temperatures. The results showed that at the tested burning temperatures (300 and 600 °C), biomass types showed a stronger influence on the light absorption at 200–550 nm than burning temperatures. Herb-derived BBS-WSOMs had a stronger light absorption than wood-derived BBS-WSOMs. This was because in herb-derived BBS-WSOMs, more conjugated diene structures or more CHO compounds of low molecular mass and high aromaticity were responsible for their light absorption at 200–300 nm, and more CHON compounds (mainly nitroaromatics compounds) were responsible for their light absorption at 365–550 nm. The CHO/CHOS compounds in wood-derived BBS-WSOMs and CHON compounds in herb-derived BBS-WSOMs were respectively responsible for their light absorption at 365–550 nm. Interestingly, O-containing groups played an increasingly important role in enhancing light absorption with the increasing wavelength at 220–275 nm, while highly aliphatic structure with low O content played an increasingly important role in enhancing light absorption with the increasing wavelength at 365–550 nm. This study is beneficial for deeply understanding the different molecules-dependent light absorption of BBS-WSOMs, having significant implications in atmospheric environment management and quality control."

 The Mediterranean Sea is a well-documented region of cyclogenesis where hundreds of cyclones of variable lifetime, intensity and structure form every year. Although they are smaller, weaker and shorter in duration compared to tropical or most of the extratropical cyclones, they are often associated with high impact weather phenomena, due to significant amount of precipitation, strong winds and storm surges, thus affecting the coastal areas in the Mediterranean basin. Recently, there has been a growing interest in Mediterranean cyclones which closely resemble actual tropical cyclones with spiraling rainbands around a calm, a mostly cloud-free “eye”, strong rotation winds around the center, and a warm core (WC). These cyclones are generally referred to as Tropical-Like Cyclones (TLCs) or MEDIterranean hurriCANES (medicanes). This study aims to analyse, through an observational, satellite-based approach, 23 medicanes occurred from 2000 to 2021 in order to carry out a comprehensive passive microwave (PMW)-based characterization of these cyclones. A novel methodology for detecting the “closed eye” feature has been designed and implemented. Moreover, a well-established methodology based on the 54–55 GHz temperature sounding channels is applied to all 23 cyclones to detect the WC and characterize its depth, intensity and symmetry. Finally, the high frequency channels (> 89 GHz) are exploited to retrieve cloud top height and ice water path, and to detect deep moist convection, offering insights on the role of diabatic heating in the WC development. This study applies, for the first time, both known and newly-developed PMW-based techniques and tools over an extensive medicanes' satellite-based data record in order to unveil the thermodynamic and microphysical processes which fuel the WC and to identify the cyclones which undergo a tropical-transition, (i.e., with a WC mainly driven by diabatic processes). In addition, this study evidences how PMW radiometry can contribute to address open questions on the processes that drive medicanes development and evolution, and offer useful insights into the potential classification of these complex systems."
