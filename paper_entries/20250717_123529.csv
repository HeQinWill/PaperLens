10.5194/acp-25-7499-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文通过分析法国巴黎地区长期连续的羰基硫（COS）浓度观测数据，结合大气传输模型和已知的COS源汇信息，来深入了解西欧地区人为和生物源COS的排放和吸收情况。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术或卫星观测，但它关注大气成分（特别是COS）的分析，这与大气环境遥感技术在空气质量监测和大气成分研究方面的应用密切相关。研究中使用的地面观测数据可以用于验证和校准遥感数据，而研究结果可以帮助改进大气模型的准确性，从而提高遥感反演大气成分的精度。,"['carbonyl sulfide (COS)', 'anthropogenic emissions', 'biogenic fluxes', 'atmospheric composition', 'air quality monitoring', 'land surface models']",Antoine Berchet;Isabelle Pison;Camille Huselstein;Clément Narbaud;Marine Remaud;Sauveur Belviso;Camille Abadie;Fabienne Maignan,Improved understanding of anthropogenic and biogenic carbonyl sulfide (COS) fluxes in western Europe from long-term continuous mixing ratio measurements,"We use the measurements of atmospheric carbonyl sulfide (COS) concentrations at the monitoring site of Gif-sur-Yvette (in the Paris region) from August 2014 to December 2019, combined with existing knowledge on COS fluxes in the atmosphere and a transport model, to gain insight into COS fluxes, either natural, such as oceanic emissions or vegetation and soil fluxes, or anthropogenic, from industrial activities and power generation. 
 Lack of knowledge still remains on many processes leading to carbonyl sulfide (COS) atmospheric fluxes, either natural, such as the oceanic sources or the vegetation and soil uptakes, or anthropogenic, with emissions from industrial activities and power generation. Moreover, COS atmospheric mixing ratio data are still too sparse to evaluate the estimations of these sources and sinks at the regional scale; in this context, regional estimates are very challenging.  This study assesses the anthropogenic emissions and biogenic COS uptakes at the regional scale, in the footprint of a measurement site in western Europe, at a seasonal to diurnal time resolution over half a decade.  The continuous time series of COS mixing ratios obtained at the monitoring site of Gif-sur-Yvette (GIF; in the Paris region) from August 2014 to December 2019 are compared to simulations with the Lagrangian model FLEXPART (FLEXible PARTicle), transporting oceanic sources, biogenic land fluxes from the land surface models ORCHIDEE and SiB4 (Simple Biosphere Model), and anthropogenic emissions by two different inventories.  At GIF, the seasonal variations in COS mixing ratios are dominated by the contributions of the background and ocean, the weekly to daily variations are driven by the biogenic land contribution and anthropogenic emissions may dominate for short episodes of high concentrations.  The anthropogenic emission inventory based on reported industrial emissions and the characteristics of coal power plants in Europe is consistent with the observations.  The main limitation of this inventory is the flat temporal variability applied to anthropogenic fluxes due to the lack of information on industrial and power-generation activities in viscose factories and in coal power plants. As a consequence, there are potential mismatches in the simulated plumes emitted from these hot spots.  We find that the net ecosystem COS uptake simulated by both ORCHIDEE and SiB4 is underestimated in winter at night, which suggests improvements in the parameterization of the nighttime uptake by plants for COS.  In spring, SiB4 simulates persistent nighttime uptake by vegetation, which is different than ORCHIDEE, which leads to more realistic simulations with SiB4 than with ORCHIDEE. In summer, both models represent fluxes sufficiently well, with better agreement from ORCHIDEE in terms of magnitudes."

Patnaude;Sarah Woods;Glenn Diskin,Aerosol–cloud interactions in cirrus clouds based on global-scale airborne observations and machine learning models,"Key controlling factors of cirrus clouds were individually quantified using machine learning models based on global-scale in situ observations from 12 campaigns at 67° S–87° N. Relative humidity shows much larger effects on cirrus occurrences and ice water content (IWC) fluctuations than vertical velocity. Aerosol–cloud interactions are seen for both large and small aerosols, with higher IWC and ice crystal number concentration under higher aerosol concentrations. Large aerosols are more impactful than small aerosols. 
 Cirrus cloud formation and evolution are subject to the influences of thermodynamic and dynamic conditions and aerosols. This study developed near global-scale in situ aircraft observational datasets based on 12 field campaigns that spanned from the polar regions to the tropics from 2008 to 2016. Cirrus cloud microphysical properties were investigated at temperatures ≤ −40 °C, including ice water content (IWC), ice crystal number concentration (Ni), and number-weighted mean diameter (Di). Positive correlations were found between the fluctuations of these ice microphysical properties and the fluctuations of aerosol number concentrations for larger (> 500 nm) and smaller (> 100 nm) aerosols (i.e. Na500 and Na100, respectively). Steeper linear regression slopes were seen for large aerosols compared with smaller aerosols. Machine learning (ML) models showed that using relative humidity with respect to ice (RHi) as a predictor significantly increased the accuracy of predicting cirrus occurrences compared with temperature, vertical velocity (w), and aerosol number concentrations. The ML predictions of IWC fluctuations showed higher accuracies when larger aerosols were used as a predictor compared with smaller aerosols, even though their effects were similar when predicting cirrus occurrences. To predict IWC magnitudes accurately, aerosol concentrations were particularly important at 50 to 250 s scales (i.e. 10–50 km) and showed increasing effects at low temperatures, small ice supersaturation, and strong updraughts/downdraughts. These results improve the understanding of aerosol–cloud interactions and can be used to evaluate model parameterizations of cirrus cloud properties and processes."

Galley;Riccardo Notarpietro;Veronica Rivas Boscan;Francisco Sancho;Francisco Martin Alemany;Nicolas Morew;Christian Marquardt,Observed impact of the GNSS clock data rate on radio occultation bending angles for Sentinel-6A and COSMIC-2,"Using about 120 000 occultations recorded by the Sentinel-6A and COSMIC-2 satellites, we show that using high-rate (1 s) GLONASS clock products greatly improves GLONASS occultation statistics and vertical error correlation. For GPS, the best performance is obtained with 5 s clock products. These findings result from the short-timescale behavior of the onboard atomic clocks and are important given the impact of radio occultation measurements on numerical weather predictions and climate studies. 
 Radio occultation (RO) measurements require the tracking of signals from a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) by a low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite as the signals travel through different layers of the atmosphere. The orbit and clock solutions for the GNSS constellations affect these measurements in two ways: they are needed to obtain a zero-differencing GNSS-based orbit and clock solution for the LEO, and they directly enter the processing of each single RO profile, where the orbit and clock information for the transmitter (GNSS) and receiver (LEO) satellites is required. In this work, we investigate how different GLONASS and GPS orbit and clock solutions affect the statistical properties of RO profiles by comparing our results with forward-modeled bending-angle profiles based on data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) short-range forecasts. Given that GNSS orbits are relatively smooth, this study focused on the effect of different transmitter clock data rates, and we tested the range from 1 to 30 s (specifically, the rates of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 30 s). The analysis is based on the reprocessing of Sentinel-6A data (4 months in 2021, September to December, or about 110 000 occultations) and of a smaller sample of recent COSMIC-2/FORMOSAT-7 data (5–7 August 2023, or about 9000 occultations). We find that at impact heights above about 35 km, GLONASS bending-angle statistics markedly improve with the use of higher-rate clock information. For GPS, the statistics are better for more recent GPS blocks, and a rate of 5 s provides a marginal improvement over the 30 s rate for all blocks. In the same impact height range, higher-rate GLONASS clocks also significantly reduce the vertical error correlation. These results are likely the manifestation of the different kinds of short-timescale behavior of the atomic clocks on board the GPS and GLONASS constellations."

However, the standard eddy-covariance method used for processing flux data has limitations, leading to data loss and limited resolution due to fixed time steps. This paper introduces a new method using wavelet analysis to increase temporal resolution and improve data retention. Applied at the Hesse forest flux tower in France, this approach provides high-resolution flux estimates, enhancing the accuracy of flux measurements. 
 We introduce a novel framework for estimating eddy fluxes using cross-scalogram smoothing, addressing key limitations of the standard eddy-covariance method. The standard approach suffers from fixed averaging times (typically 30 min) and limited frequency resolution, which can lead to biases and an inability to capture fast dynamics. Our method, based on wavelet transforms, allows for high-resolution analysis of fluxes in both time and frequency domains. It adaptively localises turbulent scales using a metric derived from the vertical component of the Reynolds stress tensor, enabling more accurate flux estimation under varying turbulence conditions. The proposed metric is similar to the u* and σw tests, but it is adapted to the time–frequency setting. By decoupling the filtering of perturbative scales from flux calculations, our approach allows for flexible averaging times. This adaptability makes it particularly suitable for studying rapid ecosystem responses to environmental changes, such as those occurring on timescales shorter than 1 h. We show application of the framework at the beech forest site Hesse (code FR-Hes) and demonstrate its relation with standard eddy-covariance calculations. The proposed method allows for varying the averaging time without impacting the filtering of the perturbative scales. It thus allows for producing estimates of CO2, latent heat, and sensible heat fluxes with faster dynamics (e.g. with 1, 10, and 30 min averaging time). We present statistics of the 10 min averaged fluxes and show that they align well with estimates of the 30 min standard eddy-covariance method. The improved localisation of turbulent scales results in higher estimates of carbon uptake during summer (+2 ± 1 µmolm-2s-1) and a more accurate assessment of nighttime respiration compared to standard eddy-covariance estimates. The methodology is implemented in the Julia package TurbulenceFlux.jl, making it readily accessible for practical applications."

It has been significantly modified to control data from non-professional and private measurement networks of lower quality than professional data. The modifications went in the direction of performing more sophisticated data control, applying weather radar data, and taking into account various aspects such as consistency analysis of data time series and bias detection. 
 Rain gauge measurements are one of the primary techniques used to estimate a precipitation field, but they require careful quality control. This paper describes a modified RainGaugeQC system, which is applied to real-time quality control of rain gauge measurements made every 10 min. This system works operationally at the national meteorological and hydrological service in Poland. The RainGaugeQC algorithms, which have been significantly modified, are described in detail. The modifications were made primarily to control data from non-professional measurement networks, which may be of lower quality than professional data, especially in the case of personal stations. Accordingly, the modifications went in the direction of performing more sophisticated data control, applying weather radar data, and taking into account various aspects of data quality, such as consistency analysis of data time series and bias detection. The effectiveness of the modified system was verified based on independent measurement data from manual rain gauges, which are considered one of the most accurate measurement instruments, although they mostly provide daily totals. In addition, an analysis of two case studies is presented. This highlights various issues involved in using non-professional data to generate multi-source estimates of the precipitation field."

Ochsner;Erik S. Krueger;Mengyuan Xu;Chris B. Zou,"A 3 h, 1 km surface soil moisture dataset for the contiguous United States from 2015 to 2023","We developed a 3 h, 1 km surface soil moisture dataset for the contiguous United States from 2015 to 2023 using the spatio-temporal fusion method. This dataset effectively combines the distinct advantages of two long-term surface soil moisture datasets, which is also the first hourly-level 1 km soil moisture dataset at the continental US scale. The new dataset could provide new insight into the fast changes in soil moisture along with drought and wet spell occurrences. 
 Surface soil moisture (SSM) is a critical variable for understanding the terrestrial hydrologic cycle, and it influences ecosystem dynamics, agriculture productivity, and water resource management. Although SSM information is widely estimated through satellite-derived and model-assimilated methods, datasets with fine spatio-temporal resolutions remain unavailable at the continental scale and yet are essential for improving weather forecasting, optimizing precision irrigation, and enhancing fire risk assessment. In this study, we developed a new 3 h, 1 km spatially seamless SSM dataset spanning 2015 to 2023, covering the entire contiguous United States (CONUS), using a spatio-temporal fusion model. This approach effectively combines the distinct advantages of two long-term SSM datasets, namely, the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) L4 SSM product and the Crop Condition and Soil Moisture Analytics (Crop-CASMA) dataset. The SMAP product provides spatially seamless SSM observations with a 3 h temporal resolution but at a 9 km spatial resolution, while the Crop-CASMA SSM dataset offers a finer spatial resolution of 1 km but has a daily temporal resolution and contains spatial gaps. To overcome the spatio-temporal mismatch between the two products, we developed a time series data mining approach known as the highly comparative time series analysis (HCTSA) method to extract multiple spatially seamless characteristics (e.g., maximum and mean) from the two inter-annual SSM datasets (i.e., SMAP and Crop-CASMA). Then, the fusion model was constructed using the extracted 9 and 1 km characteristics and each scene of the SMAP in turn. Finally, the 3 h, 1 km SSM data (named STF_SSM) were predicted from 2015 to 2023. The comparison with in situ data from multiple SSM observation networks showed that the performance of our STF_SSM dataset is better than the Crop-CASMA and is close to the SMAP L4 product, with a mean correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.716 at the daily scale and 0.689 at the 3 h scale. The STF_SSM dataset in this study is the first long-time-series, spatially seamless SSM dataset to realize continuous intra-day 1 km SSM observations every 3 h across the CONUS, which provides a new insight into the fast changes in soil moisture along with drought and wet spell occurrences and ecosystem responses. Additionally, this dataset provides a valuable data source for the calibration and validation of land surface models. The STF_SSM dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5066/P13CCN69 (Yang et al., 2025a)."

They can support conservation planning, environmental policy, and restoration efforts, aligning with Australia’s Strategy for Nature and global biodiversity targets to protect intact ecosystems and promote sustainable development. 
 Australia's unique biodiversity faces significant threats from anthropogenic activities that drive habitat destruction and degradation. This study presents the first comprehensive national-scale cumulative pressure map for terrestrial Australia since the 1980s, providing key insights into human disturbance of the landscape. We developed a Human Industrial Footprint (HIF) index incorporating 16 nationally relevant pressure layers, offering a more accurate representation of industrial influences than previous global-scale analyses. The HIF was used to derive an Ecological Intactness Index (EII), accounting for habitat quality, fragmentation, and connectivity. A technical validation comparing visually scored pressures in 1397 stratified random samples using high-resolution satellite images revealed a strong agreement with the HIF. We also conducted an uncertainty (sensitivity) analysis by adjusting individual pressure scores by up to ±50 % across 100,000 simulations, which showed a moderate impact on cumulative pressure scores, confirming the robustness of our approach. We believe these high-resolution datasets can be valuable tools for guiding conservation efforts, such as informing protected area expansion, ecosystem restoration priorities, and biodiversity offset strategies. By offering a detailed assessment of cumulative pressures and ecological integrity, this study addresses a critical knowledge gap, and can support evidence-based decision-making for Australia's biodiversity conservation and sustainable development objectives.

The changing climate has increased the frequency and severity of global fire events. Forested watersheds and their ecosystem functions are greatly disrupted during fire activity. Postfire concerns in forested watersheds include unpredictable and potentially simultaneous alterations in source water quality and hydro-biogeochemical processes. The degree of fire severity can complexly modify water quality through the production of fire-transformed constituents on the burned forest floor (i.e., nutrients, metal(loid)s, dissolved organic matter, and the formation of disinfection byproducts). Correspondingly, fire severity and postfire rainfall patterns can refine hydro-biogeochemical processes that influence the transport of the fire-transformed constituents (i.e., vegetation function, soil structure, hydrological pathways, and microbial communities). Postfire alterations to water quality and hydro-biogeochemical processes introduce further complexity with varying temporal influence, which ranges from months to decades. As postfire water quality and watershed response research progresses, it is essential to homogenize interdisciplinary expertise to bridge knowledge gaps between fields ranging from forest ecology, hydrology, microbiology, and geochemistry. A multidisciplinary approach in wildfire research will facilitate a comprehensive perception of the diverse water quality risks associated with fire activity and mitigate fire concerns on a global level."

This study aims to analyze daily discharge patterns in influent wastewater to identify recurring patterns for trace organic compounds, particularly those from domestic sources, providing insights into discharge dynamics originating from population chemical consumption and exposure. Over three 24-h periods, hourly composite influent samples from a wastewater treatment plant were analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Target and non-target screening revealed over 72,000 features, with 402 target compounds annotated. Temporal k-means clustering of target compounds identified five distinct daily patterns, with two clusters linked to domestic use: one correlated with wastewater flow, representing general daily population activities, and another showing a morning peak, likely associated with morning urine. Based on these patterns, cluster predictions were applied to the non-targeted feature list, prioritizing features with similar temporal trends. This led to 70 additional features associated with the morning peak pattern, with four compounds exemplarily identified. The findings highlight the value of combining targeted and non-targeted analyzes with clustering methods to improve the interpretation of complex wastewater data and unravel chemical discharge patterns linked to population exposure."

Manganese oxy(hydr)oxides (MnOx) are powerful oxidants in nature and may promote the oxidative transformation of organic P compounds; yet little is known about the role of MnOx in the molecular transformation and speciation of P from natural organic matter. Here, we investigated the molecular transformation of vermicompost-derived organic P under acidic and alkaline pH conditions in dissolved organic matter (DOM) and soil over a 35 d period. Phosphorus K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure revealed the formation of birnessite-adsorbed phosphate and Mn(II/III) phosphate at pH 4 and calcium phosphate at pH 8 in the DOM system. Birnessite-adsorbed phosphate was dominant in soils, followed by Mn(III) phosphate after 35 d. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry indicated enhanced organic P sorption and transformation into higher molecular weight aromatic compounds under acidic conditions. These findings reveal that birnessite not only mediates P speciation through surface and redox-driven interactions but also facilitates organic P stabilization via molecular transformation. The study provides new insights into how MnOx can influence both P fate in natural environments, with implications for mechanisms controlling P mobility and long-term P retention in soils."

According to the analogous characteristics of FACEs, a suspect screening framework identified an additional 43 long-chain FACEs. Overall, 71 cholesteric LCMs were identified, with 30 detected in >50% of samples. The median and highest values of their sum concentrations were 94.3 and 1880 ng/g, respectively. FACEs emerged as the dominant group, with long-chain FACEs, particularly FACEs (18:0), exhibiting significantly more abundance than short-chain and medium-chain FACEs.

Nontarget screening (NTS) analysis allows for the simultaneous chemical identification and quantitative reporting of tens of thousands of chemicals in complex environmental matrices, whereas the computational toxicology (CT) serves as another high-throughput means of rapidly and comprehensively screening chemicals for toxicity. To date, there has been a lack of guidance on how to combine NTS experiments and CT for the risk assessment of chemical mixtures and the prioritization of pollutants. In this perspective, the combination of two “big data” approaches in field studies is systematically proposed. The basic principles of performing NTS and CT in environmental studies are briefly outlined. The “top-down” and “bottom-up” strategies are proposed to summarize the two technologies during the experimental design stage, in accordance with research objectives and available information and tools. Following this, a universal framework combining NTS and CT is thoroughly explored. Six recommendations for future research are highlighted to enhance the utilization of this paradigm, involving multistep combination, multidisciplinary database, application platform, multilayered functionality, effect validation, and standardization."

However, whether NPs induce renal fibrosis remains contentious, and the reversibility of NPs-triggered nephrotoxicity has rarely been reported. This study investigated the role of lysosomes in renal fibrosis induced by low-level polystyrene (PS) NPs with particle sizes of 100 and 500 nm (PS100 and PS500) in mice using Masson staining, immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, fluorescence imaging, and other techniques. The results showed that PS100 induced more pronounced renal fibrosis than PS500. Mechanistically, PS NPs promoted autophagosome formation accompanied by the inhibition of autophagic degradation. Moreover, PS NPs impaired lysosomal degradation function, evidenced by reduced CTSB and CTSD protein levels. This impairment blocked autophagic flux, thereby inducing renal fibrosis, which was further confirmed by in vitro results. Notably, lysosomal exocytosis plays a crucial role in the clearance of NPs from mouse kidneys through activating Mcoln1 expression, which contributes to restoring autophagic flux and alleviating renal fibrosis during recovery. Collectively, our findings provide the first evidence that lysosomes serve dual functions in the persistence and reversibility of NPs-induced nephrotoxicity, which could be valuable for the intervention and mitigation of kidney damage resulting from environmental NPs exposure."

The role of atmospheric particulate matter (PM) and PM deposited on PV panels, associated with domestic and international trade, in attenuating sunlight and influencing SEYGs remains largely unexplored, although their investigation could help mitigate SEYGs. We integrate well-evaluated models of trade, atmospheric composition, and solar PV performance to quantify and attribute the SEYGs that occur in Northeast Asia (NEA) (including China, South Korea, and Japan) to the production and consumption of goods and services within these countries and globally. For utility-scale solar PV facilities, we estimate an SEYG of 33.6 TWh/yr due to the production of goods and services across NEA in 2015. In contrast, the SEYG linked to the consumption of goods and services is lower at 24.6 TWh/yr, with the 9 TWh/yr difference accounting for the net exports outside NEA. Imports have only avoided an SEYG of 1.4 TWh/yr across NEA. Addressing regional SEYGs requires a coordinated response from the producers and consumers of goods and services."

This study utilizes long‐term observations from Polar, Wind, and Arase spacecraft to generate comprehensive global AKR occurrence rate maps, revealing a high‐latitude and nightside preference. A detailed investigation of the equatorial shadow region confirms that the dense plasmasphere blocks AKR emissions across all wave frequencies. Low‐frequency emissions (<100 kHz) are presents outside the shadow region at larger radial distance, which is attributed to magnetosheath reflection, while higher‐frequency emissions (>100 kHz) propagate via plasmaspheric ducting and leakage, filling the equatorial region immediately outside the plasmasphere. Ray‐tracing simulations identify low‐density ducts within the plasmasphere as crucial channels that enable AKR to penetrate the dense plasmasphere, particularly at higher frequencies.

In this study, we identify key spatiotemporal patterns of rainy‐season precipitation anomalies across HMA. These patterns capture joint spatial and temporal signals of precipitation anomalies, rather than only spatial or temporal patterns individually. Consideration of the joint patterns provides a physical constraint that helps identify those more robust predictors, which as a result, are closely linked to the full seasonal evolution of precipitation anomalies. Based on these spatiotemporal patterns and their predictors reflecting slowly varying atmospheric boundary conditions, we develop a physical‐statistical prediction model that significantly improves predictions of both the detailed seasonal evolution and the rainy‐season mean of HMA precipitation anomalies. This advancement provides valuable insights for enhancing early warning capabilities and improving water resource management in vulnerable high mountain regions."

We found that for electrons less than 200 keV on dawnside between L shell of 6–10, the precipitation ratio (the ratio between precipitating flux and locally trapped flux) increases with increasing L and decreasing energy. This is caused by chorus wave pitch angle scattering precipitation. Conversely, the precipitation ratio increases with L and energy for electrons greater than 200 keV on both dawnside and duskside between L = 8–10. This may be due to electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves and current sheet scattering.

A strong negative relationship between terrestrial precipitation and global mean sea level underscores the critical role of ENSO‐driven global water redistribution.

Here, we investigate how model grid resolution affects the simulation of present and future SAWs using ensemble simulations from a newly developed climate model with varying atmospheric resolutions (100, 50, and 25 km). At finer resolutions, the model better resolves coastal mountains, strengthening the land‐sea temperature gradients conducive to SAWs and enhancing adiabatic warming over the leeward side. Consequently, the frequency and intensity of SAWs at 25‐km model resolution are significantly more realistic than at coarser resolution. As climate warms, while the occurrence of SAWs decreases across all resolutions (approximately −10%), the changes in their impacts are resolution dependent. At finer resolution, future SAWs are projected to further exacerbate wildfire risks over coastal Southern California due to an increased vapor pressure deficit."

Using high spatiotemporal resolution observations from a C‐band phased array radar (PAR), assimilated into a four‐dimensional variational data assimilation system, we primarily analyze dynamical processes contributing to the development of the supercell storm and its associated mesocyclone. Our study shows that just before the convective cell is triggered, a significant convergence zone develops to the west of the terrain, forming several meso‐γ vortices near the surface. During the merger of the convective cell and the QLCS from upper to lower levels, a strong downdraft generated by the QLCS enhances low‐level horizontal convergence, further producing a stretching effect on the vortices within the storm and significantly increasing vertical vorticity. With the formation of the mesocyclone in the mature stage of supercell storm, the height of the rotational center rises to 4.5 km, and the maximum rotational velocity reaches 20 m/s. Our results indicate that the surface convergence lines and the meso‐γ vortices along them strengthen low‐level convergence and generate strong updrafts, triggering the initial storm. These intense updrafts transform horizontal vorticity into vertical vorticity and transport it upward. Additionally, the process of convective merging leads to strengthen low‐level horizontal convergence, which forcibly stretches the mesovortex, enhancing vertical vorticity and allowing the convective storm to develop in a strong, organized manner and form the supercell storm."

However, the effect of WWBs on the oceanic intraseasonal Kelvin waves in the context of ENSO diversity formation remains largely unexplored owing to limited observational data and theoretical analysis. To explore ENSO diversity mechanisms, we employ a combination of 20–90–day bandpass filtering, complex empirical orthogonal function analysis and composite analysis to investigate to what extent the oceanic Kelvin waves are influenced by WWBs. From filtered sea level anomalies in the equatorial Pacific Ocean (150°E−100°W, 2°S–2°N) between 1993 and 2023, we identified 149 downwelling and 119 upwelling Kelvin waves. During eastern‐Pacific (EP) El Niño years, the WWBs have a further east active center, stronger intensity, a larger zonal extent and longer duration compared to central‐Pacific (CP) El Niño years. Similarly, Kelvin waves have stronger intensity, broader extension, and zonal distribution along the equator in EP El Niño years than in CP El Niño years. Statistical and composite analysis reveal a consistent relationship between the zonal range, center location, duration, strength of WWBs and the corresponding response of Kelvin waves (center location, speed, duration, amplitude) across CP and EP El Niño years. The finding implies that WWBs may act as a precursor to ENSO diversity from an oceanic perspective, playing a key role in both the theoretical framework and prediction of ENSO diversity."

 Living biological systems rely on the continuous operation of chemical reaction networks. These networks sustain out-of-equilibrium regimes in which chemical energy is continually converted into controlled mechanical work and motion1–3. Out-of-equilibrium reaction networks have also enabled the design and successful development of artificial autonomously operating molecular machines4,5, in which networks comprising pairs of formally—but non-microscopically—reverse reaction pathways drive controlled motion at the molecular level. In biological systems, the concurrent operation of several reaction pathways is enabled by the chemoselectivity of enzymes and their cofactors, and nature’s dissipative reaction networks involve several classes of reactions. By contrast, the reactivity that has been harnessed to develop chemical reaction networks in pursuit of artificial molecular machines is limited to a single reaction type. Only a small number of synthetic systems exhibit chemically fuelled continuous controlled molecular-level motion6–8 and all exploit the same class of acylation–hydrolysis reaction. Here we show that a redox reaction network, comprising concurrent oxidation and reduction pathways, can drive chemically fuelled continuous autonomous unidirectional motion about a C–C bond in a structurally simple synthetic molecular motor based on an achiral biphenyl. The combined use of an oxidant and reductant as fuels and the directionality of the motor are both enabled by exploiting the enantioselectivity and functional separation of reactivity inherent to enzyme catalysis.

 Atherosclerosis is the main underlying cause of cardiovascular diseases. Its prevention is based on the detection and treatment of traditional cardiovascular risk factors1. However, individuals at risk for early vascular disease often remain unidentified2. Recent research has identified new molecules in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis3, highlighting the need for alternative disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets to improve early diagnosis and therapy efficacy. Here, we observed that imidazole propionate (ImP), produced by microorganisms, is associated with the extent of atherosclerosis in mice and in two independent human cohorts. Furthermore, ImP administration to atherosclerosis-prone mice fed with chow diet was sufficient to induce atherosclerosis without altering the lipid profile, and was linked to activation of both systemic and local innate and adaptive immunity and inflammation. Specifically, we found that ImP caused atherosclerosis through the imidazoline-1 receptor (I1R, also known as nischarin) in myeloid cells. Blocking this ImP–I1R axis inhibited the development of atherosclerosis induced by ImP or high-cholesterol diet in mice. Identification of the strong association of ImP with active atherosclerosis and the contribution of the ImP–I1R axis to disease progression opens new avenues for improving the early diagnosis and personalized therapy of atherosclerosis. Imidazole propionate produced by gut microbiota is associated with atherosclerosis in mouse models and in humans, and causes the development of atherosclerosis through activation of the imidazoline-1 receptor in myeloid cells."

 Birds have a sex chromosome system in which females are heterogametic (ZW) and males are homogametic (ZZ)1. The differentiation of avian sex chromosomes from ancestral autosomes entails the loss of most genes from the W chromosome during evolution1,2. However, the extent to which mechanisms evolved that counterbalance this substantial reduction in female gene dosage remains unclear. Here we report functional in vivo and evolutionary analyses of a Z-linked microRNA (miR-2954) with strong male-biased expression, previously proposed to mediate avian sex chromosome dosage compensation3. We knocked out miR-2954 in chicken, which resulted in early embryonic lethality in homozygous knockout males, probably driven by specific upregulation of dosage-sensitive Z-linked target genes. Evolutionary gene expression analyses further revealed that these dosage-sensitive target genes underwent both transcriptional and translational upregulation on the single Z in female birds. Altogether, this work unveils a scenario in which evolutionary pressures following W gene loss drove transcriptional and translational upregulation of dosage-sensitive Z-linked genes in females but also their transcriptional upregulation in males. The resulting excess of transcripts in males, resulting from the combined activity of two upregulated dosage-sensitive Z gene copies, was in turn offset by the emergence of a highly targeted miR-2954-mediated transcript degradation mechanism during avian evolution. This study uncovered a unique sex chromosome dosage compensation system in birds, in which a microRNA has become essential for male survival. Birds have evolved a unique sex chromosome dosage compensation mechanism involving the male-biased microRNA (miR-2954), which is essential for male survival by regulating the expression of dosage-sensitive Z-linked genes."

 Immigrants to high-income countries often face considerable and persistent difficulties in the labour market1–6, whereas their native-born children typically experience economic progress6–9. However, little is known about the extent to which these immigrant–native earnings differences stem from unequal pay when doing the same work for the same employer versus labour market processes that sort immigrants into lower-paid jobs. Here, using data from nine European and North American countries, we show that the segregation of workers with immigrant backgrounds into lower-paying jobs accounts for about three-quarters of overall immigrant–native earnings differences. Although within-job pay inequality remains notable for immigrants in several countries, our results demonstrate that unequal access to higher-paying jobs is the primary driver of the immigrant–native pay gap across a range of institutionally and demographically diverse contexts. These findings highlight the importance of policies aimed at reducing between-job segregation, such as language training10–13, job training13–15, job search assistance programmes13,15, improving access to domestic education13,16,17, recognizing foreign qualifications18,19, and settlement programmes aimed at enhancing access to job-relevant information and networks13,20,21. Policies that target employer bias in hiring and promotion decisions are also likely to be effective, whereas measures aimed at ensuring equal pay for equal work may have more limited scope for further progress in closing the immigrant–native pay gap22–28.

 Tumour necrosis is associated with poor prognosis in cancer1,2 and is thought to occur passively when tumour growth outpaces nutrient supply. Here we report, however, that neutrophils actively induce tumour necrosis. In multiple cancer mouse models, we found a tumour-elicited Ly6GHighLy6CLow neutrophil population that was unable to extravasate in response to inflammatory challenges but formed neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) more efficiently than classical Ly6GHighLy6CHigh neutrophils. The presence of these ‘vascular-restricted’ neutrophils correlated with the appearance of a ‘pleomorphic’ necrotic architecture in mice. In tumours with pleomorphic necrosis, we found intravascular aggregates of neutrophils and NETs that caused occlusion of the tumour vasculature, driving hypoxia and necrosis of downstream vascular beds. Furthermore, we found that cancer cells adjacent to these necrotic regions (that is, in ‘perinecrotic’ areas) underwent epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, explaining the paradoxical metastasis-enhancing effect of tumour necrosis. Blocking NET formation genetically or pharmacologically reduced the extent of tumour necrosis and lung metastasis. Thus, by showing that NETs drive vascular occlusion, pleomorphic necrosis and metastasis, we demonstrate that tumour necrosis is not necessarily a passive byproduct of tumour growth and that it can be blocked to reduce metastatic spread. Neutrophils actively induce tumour necrosis, driving vascular occlusion, pleomorphic necrosis and metastasis."

 Propagation of intense X-ray pulses through dense media has led to the observation of phenomena such as atomic X-ray lasing1,2, self-induced transparency3 and stimulated X-ray Raman scattering (SXRS)4. SXRS has been long predicted as a means to launch and probe valence-electron wavepackets and as a building block for nonlinear X-ray spectroscopies5,6. However, experimental observations of SXRS to date4,7,8 have not provided spectroscopic information, and theoretical modelling has largely implemented hard-to-realize phase-coherent attosecond pulses. Here we demonstrate SXRS with spectroscopic precision, that is, detection of valence-excited states in neon with a near Fourier-limited joint energy–time resolution of 0.1 eV–40 fs. We used a new covariance analysis between statistically spiky broadband incident X-ray and scattered X-ray Raman pulses. Using 18,000 single shots, we beat not only the incident (about 8 eV) bandwidth but also the  approximately 0.2 eV instrumental energy resolution, thus creating super-resolution conditions, in analogy to super-resolved fluorescence microscopy9. Our experimental results, supported by ab initio propagation simulations, reveal the competition between lasing in the ion and stimulated Raman scattering in the neutral. We demonstrate enhanced signal collection efficiency and a broad excitation window, surpassing spontaneous Raman efficiencies by orders of magnitude. This stochastic SXRS approach represents a first step towards tracking elementary events that determine chemical outcomes10. A high-resolution spectroscopic tool is demonstrated using the stochastically fluctuating intensity spikes in time and energy domains of a self-amplified spontaneous emission X-ray free-electron laser."

 To gain a comprehensive, unbiased perspective on molecular changes in the brain that may underlie the need for sleep, we have characterized the transcriptomes of single cells isolated from rested and sleep-deprived flies. Here we report that transcripts upregulated after sleep deprivation, in sleep-control neurons projecting to the dorsal fan-shaped body1,2 (dFBNs) but not ubiquitously in the brain, encode almost exclusively proteins with roles in mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis. These gene expression changes are accompanied by mitochondrial fragmentation, enhanced mitophagy and an increase in the number of contacts between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum, creating conduits3,4 for the replenishment of peroxidized lipids5. The morphological changes are reversible after recovery sleep and blunted by the installation of an electron overflow6,7 in the respiratory chain. Inducing or preventing mitochondrial fission or fusion8–13 in dFBNs alters sleep and the electrical properties of sleep-control cells in opposite directions: hyperfused mitochondria increase, whereas fragmented mitochondria decrease, neuronal excitability and sleep. ATP concentrations in dFBNs rise after enforced waking because of diminished ATP consumption during the arousal-mediated inhibition of these neurons14, which augments their mitochondrial electron leak7. Consistent with this view, uncoupling electron flux from ATP synthesis15 relieves the pressure to sleep, while exacerbating mismatches between electron supply and ATP demand (by powering ATP synthesis with a light-driven proton pump16) precipitates sleep. Sleep, like ageing17,18, may be an inescapable consequence of aerobic metabolism. Research on Drosophila neurons shows links between the need to sleep and aerobic metabolism, indicating that the pressure to sleep may have a mitochondrial origin."

 The synthesis of enantiopure compounds is a central focus in organic chemistry owing to the prevalence of chiral centres in biological systems and the impact of homochirality on molecular properties. With growing recognition of electrochemistry as a powerful tool to improve the scope and sustainability of organic synthesis1, increasing efforts have been directed towards developing asymmetric electrocatalytic reactions to access challenging chiral molecules2–4. However, many useful electrochemical reactions rely on direct electrolysis without a catalyst, making them inherently difficult to render enantioselective. Supporting electrolytes are integral to electrochemical systems and, in addition to ensuring sufficient solution conductivity, they can influence the rate and selectivity of electrochemical transformations5. Chiral supporting electrolytes can mediate asymmetric reactions via direct electrolysis, but their use in organic electrosynthesis remains largely unexplored6,7. Here we describe the use of substoichiometric chiral phosphate salts as supporting electrolytes to facilitate the oxidation of racemic trivalent phosphines to afford enantioenriched phosphine oxides. Our approach relies on a dynamic-kinetic-resolution strategy that exploits the rapid pyramidal inversion of an anodically generated phosphoniumyl radical cation8, while a high concentration of chiral phosphate at the electrode–electrolyte interface9,10 enhances enantioselective control during rate-limiting nucleophilic addition. Our results highlight the promise of chiral supporting electrolytes for promoting radical-ion-mediated asymmetric transformations.

 Whole-genome doubling (WGD) is a common feature of human cancers and is linked to tumour progression, drug resistance, and metastasis1–6. Here we examine the impact of WGD on somatic evolution and immune evasion at single-cell resolution in patient tumours. Using single-cell whole-genome sequencing, we analysed 70 high-grade serous ovarian cancer samples from 41 patients (30,260 tumour genomes) and observed near-ubiquitous evidence that WGD is an ongoing mutational process. WGD was associated with increased cell–cell diversity and higher rates of chromosomal missegregation and consequent micronucleation. We developed a mutation-based WGD timing method called doubleTime to delineate specific modes by which WGD can drive tumour evolution, including early fixation followed by considerable diversification, multiple parallel WGD events on a pre-existing background of copy-number diversity, and evolutionarily late WGD in small clones and individual cells. Furthermore, using matched single-cell RNA sequencing and high-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy, we found that inflammatory signalling and cGAS-STING pathway activation result from ongoing chromosomal instability, but this is restricted to predominantly diploid tumours (WGD-low). By contrast, predominantly WGD tumours (WGD-high), despite increased missegregation, exhibited cell-cycle dysregulation, STING1 repression, and immunosuppressive phenotypic states. Together, these findings establish WGD as an ongoing mutational process that promotes evolvability and dysregulated immunity in high-grade serous ovarian cancer.

 Most people in the USA manage their health by taking at least one prescription drug, and drugs classified as non-antibiotics can adversely affect the gut microbiome and disrupt intestinal homeostasis1,2. Here we identify medications that are associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal infections across a population cohort of more than one million individuals monitored over 15 years. Notably, the cardiac glycoside digoxin and other drugs identified in this epidemiological study are sufficient to alter the composition of the microbiome and the risk of infection with Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Tm) in mice. The effect of digoxin treatment on S. Tm infection is transmissible through the microbiome, and characterization of this interaction highlights a digoxin-responsive β-defensin that alters the microbiome composition and consequent immune surveillance of the invading pathogen. Combining epidemiological and experimental approaches thus provides an opportunity to uncover drug–host–microbiome–pathogen interactions that increase the risk of infections in humans.

 Non-antibiotic drugs can alter the composition of the gut microbiome1, but they have largely unknown implications for human health2. Here we examined how non-antibiotics affect the ability of gut commensals to resist colonization by enteropathogens3. We also developed an in vitro assay to assess enteropathogen growth in drug-perturbed microbial communities. Pathogenic Gammaproteobacteria were more resistant to non-antibiotics than commensals and their post-treatment expansion was potentiated. For 28% of the 53 drugs tested, the growth of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium. (S. Tm) in synthetic and human stool-derived communities was increased, and similar effects were observed for other enteropathogens. Non-antibiotics promoted pathogen proliferation by inhibiting the growth of commensals, altering microbial interactions and enhancing the ability of S. Tm to exploit metabolic niches. Drugs that promoted pathogen expansion in vitro increased the intestinal S. Tm load in mice. For the antihistamine terfenadine, drug-induced disruption of colonization resistance accelerated disease onset and increased inflammation caused by S. Tm.

 Hybridized matter–photon excitations in hyperbolic crystals—anisotropic materials characterized by permittivity tensor components with opposite sign—have attracted substantial attention owing to their strong light–matter interactions in the form of hyperbolic polaritons1–3. However, these phenomena have been restricted to hyperbolic crystals, whose optical responses are confined to fixed spectral regions and lack tunability, thereby limiting their broader applicability4,5. Here we demonstrate the emergence of hyperbolic surface phonon polaritons in a non-hyperbolic yttrium vanadate (YVO4) crystal. Using real-space nanoimaging combined with theoretical analyses, we visualize hyperbolic wavefronts of surface phonon polaritons on YVO4 crystal surfaces within its non-hyperbolic frequency range, where the permittivity tensor components of the material have the same negative sign. Furthermore, by varying the temperature from room temperature to cryogenic levels, we realize in situ manipulation of polariton dispersions, enabling a topological transition from hyperbolic to canalization and eventually to the elliptic regime. This temperature-controlled dispersion engineering not only provides precise control over polariton topology but also modulates their wavelength and group velocity, showing remarkable sensitivity alongside low-loss, long-range propagation. These findings extend the realm of hyperbolic nano-optics by removing the reliance on hyperbolic crystals, unlocking opportunities for applications in negative refraction6–10, superlensing11,12, polaritonic chemistry13, integrated photonics14–16 and beyond.

Here we report an innovative strategy to engineer broad-spectrum, durable and complete disease resistance in plants through expression of a chimeric protein containing a flexible polypeptide coupled with a single or dual conserved pathogen-originated protease cleavage site fused in frame to the N terminus of an autoactive nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich-repeat immune receptor (NLR) containing a coiled-coil or RESISTANCE TO POWDERY MILDEW 8-like coiled-coil domain. Following invasion, pathogen-originated specific proteases cleave the inactive chimeric protein to form free autoactive NLR, triggering broad-spectrum plant disease resistance. We demonstrate that a single engineered NLR can confer broad-spectrum and complete resistance against multiple potyviruses. Given that many pathogenic organisms across kingdoms encode proteases, this strategy has the potential to be exploited to control viruses, bacteria, oomycetes, fungi, nematodes and pests in plants. Cleavage by pathogen-derived proteases of an engineered chimeric protein activates its plant immune receptor component, enabling broad-spectrum resistance to pathogens in plants."

 With their superficially shark-like appearance, the Mesozoic ichthyosaurs provide a classic illustration of major morphological adaptations in an ancestrally terrestrial tetrapod lineage following the invasion of marine habitats1–3. Much of what is known about ichthyosaur soft tissues derives from specimens with body outlines4–6. However, despite offering insights into aspects of biology that are otherwise difficult to envisage from skeletal evidence alone (such as the presence of a crescentic fluke), information on their soft parts has hitherto been limited to a taxonomically narrow sample of small- to dolphin-sized animals2,4–6. Here we report the discovery of a metre-long front flipper of the large-bodied Jurassic ichthyosaur Temnodontosaurus, including unique details of its soft-tissue anatomy. In addition to revealing a wing-like planform, the fossil preserves a serrated trailing edge that is reinforced by novel cartilaginous integumental elements, herein denominated chondroderms. We also document chordwise-parallel skin ornamentations and a protracted fleshy distal tip that presumably acted like a flexible winglet in life. By integrating morphological and numerical data, we show that the observed features probably provided hydroacoustic benefits, and conclude that the visually guided7,8 Temnodontosaurus relied on stealth while hunting in dim-lit pelagic environments. This unexpected combination of control surface modifications represents a previously unrecognized mode of concealment, and underscores the importance of soft-tissue fossils when inferring aspects of palaeoethology and predator–prey palaeoecology.

 Solution-processed light-emitting diodes based on non-toxic copper–iodide hybrids1 are a compelling solution for efficient and stable deep-blue lighting, owing to their tunability, high photoluminescence efficiency and environmental sustainability2. Here we present a hybrid copper–iodide that shows near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield (99.6%) with an emission wavelength of 449 nm and colour coordinates (0.147, 0.087), alongside its emission mechanism and charge transport characteristics. We use the thin film of this hybrid as the sole active emissive layer to fabricate deep-blue light-emitting diodes and subsequently enhance the device performance through a dual interfacial hydrogen-bond passivation strategy. This synergetic surface modification approach, integrating a hydrogen-bond-acceptor self-assembled monolayer with an ultrathin polymethyl methacrylate capping layer, effectively passivates both heterojunctions of the copper–iodide hybrid emissive layer and optimizes charge injections. We achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency of 12.57%, a maximum luminance of 3,970.30 cd m−2 with colour coordinates (0.147, 0.091) and an excellent operational stability (half-lifetime) of 204 hours under ambient conditions. We further showcase a large-area device of 4 cm2 that maintains high efficiency.

 A pervasive dilemma in brain-wide association studies1 (BWAS) is whether to prioritize functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan time or sample size. We derive a theoretical model showing that individual-level phenotypic prediction accuracy increases with sample size and total scan duration (sample size × scan time per participant). The model explains empirical prediction accuracies well across 76 phenotypes from nine resting-fMRI and task-fMRI datasets (R2 = 0.89), spanning diverse scanners, acquisitions, racial groups, disorders and ages. For scans of ≤20 min, accuracy increases linearly with the logarithm of the total scan duration, suggesting that sample size and scan time are initially interchangeable. However, sample size is ultimately more important. Nevertheless, when accounting for the overhead costs of each participant (such as recruitment), longer scans can be substantially cheaper than larger sample size for improving prediction performance. To achieve high prediction performance, 10 min scans are cost inefficient. In most scenarios, the optimal scan time is at least 20 min. On average, 30 min scans are the most cost-effective, yielding 22% savings over 10 min scans. Overshooting the optimal scan time is cheaper than undershooting it, so we recommend a scan time of at least 30 min. Compared with resting-state whole-brain BWAS, the most cost-effective scan time is shorter for task-fMRI and longer for subcortical-to-whole-brain BWAS. In contrast to standard power calculations, our results suggest that jointly optimizing sample size and scan time can boost prediction accuracy while cutting costs. Our empirical reference is available online for future study design (

 The metabolic activity of soil microbiomes has a central role in global nutrient cycles1. Understanding how soil metabolic activity responds to climate-driven environmental perturbations is a key challenge2,3. However, the ecological, spatial and chemical complexity of soils4–6 impedes understanding how these communities respond to perturbations. Here we address this complexity by combining dynamic measurements of respiratory nitrate metabolism7 with modelling to reveal functional regimes that define soil responses to environmental change. Measurements across more than 1,500 soil microcosms subjected to pH perturbations8,9 reveal regimes in which distinct mechanisms govern metabolite dynamics. A minimal model with two parameters, biomass activity and growth-limiting nutrient availability, predicts nitrate utilization dynamics across soils and pH perturbations. Parameter shifts under perturbation reveal three functional regimes, each linked to distinct mechanisms: (1) an acidic regime marked by cell death and suppressed metabolism; (2) a nutrient-limited regime in which dominant taxa exploit matrix-released nutrients; and (3) a resurgent growth regime driven by exponential growth of rare taxa in nutrient-rich conditions. We validated these model-derived mechanisms with nutrient measurements, amendment experiments, sequencing and isolate studies. Additional experiments and meta-analyses suggest that functional regimes are widespread in pH-perturbed soils. Experimental perturbation of soil pH leads to a generalizable model of the soil microcosm comprising three functional regimes with distinct mechanisms linking environmental change to metabolite dynamics."

 Early detection of structural heart disease is critical to improving outcomes, but widespread screening remains limited by the cost and accessibility of imaging tools such as echocardiography1,2. Recent advances in machine learning applied to heart rhythm recordings have shown promise in identifying disease3,4, although previous work has been limited by development in narrow populations or targeting only select heart conditions5. Here we introduce a deep learning model, EchoNext, trained on more than 1 million heart rhythm and imaging records across a large and diverse health system to detect many forms of structural heart disease. The model demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy in internal and external validation, outperforming cardiologists in a controlled evaluation and showing consistent performance across different care settings and racial and/or ethnic groups. The models were prospectively evaluated in a clinical trial of patients without previous cardiac imaging, successfully identifying previously undiagnosed heart disease. These findings support the potential of artificial intelligence to expand access to heart disease screening at scale. To enable further development and transparency, we have publicly released model weights and a large, annotated dataset linking heart rhythm data to imaging-based diagnoses.

 Liquids comprising two coexisting phases can form a range of stable and metastable states, including wetting films, droplets and threads1–3. Processes that permit rapid and reversible transformations between these morphologies, however, have been difficult to realize because physical properties required for rapid shape change (for example, low interfacial tension or viscosity) provide pathways for relaxation that result in short-lived states. Fully reversible formation of long-lived microdomain states would expand the palette of properties that can be accessed dynamically using biphasic liquids (for example, tunable optical metamaterials). Here we report the discovery of shape-shifting and bistable microdomains of a biphasic liquid system consisting of an isotropic oil and a liquid crystalline oil. The isotropic oil forms stable wetting films (‘original’ shape) between solid surfaces and an overlying liquid crystal phase, and, when exposed to a transient (<1 s) a.c. electric field at low frequency (10 Hz), transforms into long-lived (>24 h) spherical domains (‘temporary’ shape) stabilized by topological defects in the liquid crystal1,4,5. Subsequent application of an a.c. electric field of high frequency (1 kHz) triggers solitons to form in the liquid crystal6–8, creating kinetic pathways that lead to remarkably rapid (<3 s) coalescence of the dispersed spherical domains and recovery of the original shape (wetting film)1,8,9. We show rapid and reversible switching between distinct optical states of the biphasic system, with each state persisting without continuous application of the field, thus providing a combination of optical properties long sought in thin liquid films10–17. The fully reversible and long-lived emulsion formation reported here appears promising for materials synthesis, microchemical systems and tunable optical metamaterials (for example, to control visibility and transmittance of light through windows)17–21.

 Terrestrial planets and small bodies in our Solar System are theorized to have assembled from interstellar solids mixed with rocky solids that precipitated from a hot, cooling gas1,2. The first high-temperature minerals to recondense from this gaseous reservoir start the clock on planet formation3,4. However, the production mechanism of this initial hot gas and its importance to planet formation in other systems are unclear. Here we report the astronomical detection of this t = 0 moment, capturing the building blocks of a new planetary system beginning its assembly. The young protostar HOPS-315 is observed at infrared and millimetre wavelengths with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), revealing a reservoir of warm silicon monoxide gas and crystalline silicate minerals low in the atmosphere of a disk within 2.2 au of the star, physically isolated from the millimetre SiO jet. Comparison with condensation models with rapid grain growth and disk structure models suggests the formation of refractory solids analogous to those in our Solar System. Our results indicate that the environment in the inner disk region is influenced by sublimation of interstellar solids and subsequent refractory solid recondensation from this gas reservoir on timescales comparable with refractory condensation in our own Solar System.

 A lithium (Li)-metal anode paired with a high-nickel cathode is considered to be a combination that holds promise to surpass the 500 Wh kg−1 threshold1,2. Approaching such high energy density, electrolytes capable of stabilizing both anode and cathode interphases are of importance to secure safe and long-term cycling3,4. Although anion-derived inorganic interphases have shown remarkable success at the Li side5–7, developing intrinsic strategies to concurrently protect both electrodes remains a key challenge. Here we report a micro-emulsion strategy for electrolyte design that bypasses the Li+ solvation regulation and produces fluoride-rich interphases for both electrodes. Specifically, liquid–liquid interfacial tension between the micelles and carbonate solvents, rather than the electric field, propels the motion of fluorinated droplets towards the anode and the cathode. In this way, the interphase construction of both electrodes can be enhanced and decoupled from the solvation structure strategy. Through use of the micro-emulsion electrolyte, two pouch full cells with energy densities of 531 Wh kg−1 and 547 Wh kg−1 retain 81% and 79% of their capacity after 189 and 155 cycles, respectively.

Zunica,Observation of charge–parity symmetry breaking in baryon decays,"The LHCb experiment at CERN has observed significant asymmetries between the decay rates of the beauty baryon and its CP-conjugated antibaryon, thus demonstrating CP violation in baryon decays. 
 The Standard Model of particle physics—the theory of particles and interactions at the smallest scale—predicts that matter and antimatter interact differently due to violation of the combined symmetry of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). Charge conjugation transforms particles into their antimatter particles, whereas the parity transformation inverts spatial coordinates. This prediction applies to both mesons, which consist of a quark and an antiquark, and baryons, which are composed of three quarks. However, despite having been discovered in various meson decays, CP violation has yet to be observed in baryons, the type of matter that makes up the observable Universe. Here we report a study of the decay of the beauty baryon

             baryon and its CP-conjugated antibaryon, providing, to our knowledge, the first observation of CP violation in baryon decays and demonstrating the different behaviours of baryons and antibaryons. In the Standard Model, CP violation arises from the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa mechanism2, and new forces or particles beyond the Standard Model could provide further contributions. This discovery opens a new path in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model. The LHCb experiment at CERN has observed significant asymmetries between the decay rates of the beauty baryon and its CP-conjugated antibaryon, thus demonstrating CP violation in baryon decays."

 Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is the largest natural source of new nitrogen (N) that supports terrestrial productivity1,2, yet estimates of global terrestrial BNF remain highly uncertain3,4. Here we show that this uncertainty is partly because of sampling bias, as field BNF measurements in natural terrestrial ecosystems occur where N fixers are 17 times more prevalent than their mean abundances worldwide. To correct this bias, we develop new estimates of global terrestrial BNF by upscaling field BNF measurements using spatially explicit abundances of all major biogeochemical N-fixing niches. We find that natural biomes sustain lower BNF, 65 (52–77) Tg N yr−1, than previous empirical bottom-up estimates3,4, with most BNF occurring in tropical forests and drylands. We also find high agricultural BNF in croplands and cultivated pastures, 56 (54–58) Tg N yr−1. Agricultural BNF has increased terrestrial BNF by 64% and total terrestrial N inputs from all sources by 60% over pre-industrial levels. Our results indicate that BNF may impose stronger constraints on the carbon sink in natural terrestrial biomes and represent a larger source of agricultural N than is generally considered in analyses of the global N cycle5,6, with implications for proposed safe operating limits for N use7,8. Biological nitrogen fixation may impose stronger constraints on the carbon sink in natural terrestrial biomes and represent a larger source of agricultural nitrogen than is generally considered in analyses of the global nitrogen cycle."

Maxwell,Prophages block cell surface receptors to preserve their viral progeny,"Zip promotes the accumulation of free phages in bacterial lysogen communities, safeguarding phage progeny. 
 In microbial communities, viruses compete for host cells and have evolved diverse mechanisms to inhibit competitors. One strategy is superinfection exclusion, whereby an established viral infection prevents a secondary infection of the same cell1. This phenomenon has been shown to have an important role in the spread of eukaryotic viruses. Here we determine that superinfection exclusion proteins in bacterial viruses (bacteriophages, hereafter phages) perform a similar role, promoting viral spread through the bacterial community. We characterize a phage protein that alters the dynamics of a common phage receptor, the type IV pilus. This protein, known as Zip, does not abrogate pilus activity, but fine-tunes it, providing a strong phage defence without a fitness cost. Notably, Zip also prevents internalization and destruction of newly released phage progeny, a phenomenon that we call the anti-Kronos effect after the Greek god who consumed his offspring. Zip activity promotes the accumulation of free phages in bacterial lysogen communities, thereby enhancing viral spread. We further demonstrate that the anti-Kronos effect is conserved across diverse prophage-encoded superinfection exclusion systems. Our results identify the mechanistic basis of a superinfection exclusion system that safeguards phage progeny and provide insights into the conservation of viral defence mechanisms among bacterial and eukaryotic systems. Zip promotes the accumulation of free phages in bacterial lysogen communities, safeguarding phage progeny."

 Swarm intelligence models represent a powerful tool to address complex tasks by multi-agent systems, although they are rarely used in practical applications as decentralized cooperation logic. Modern challenges include the improvement of model reliability with small swarm sizes and enhancing performance with minimal number of free parameters. Available techniques are generally tuned for computational optimization, at the expense of the applicability to real-world scenarios. Merging concepts from meta-heuristic methods and consensus theory we propose a swarm cooperation model which can act both as virtual optimizer and vehicle controller. The model shows a higher or equal success rate with respect to benchmark methods on 22 out of 33 landscapes when dealing with less equal 16 agents and low dimensional problems. Beyond multimodal optimization, a computational proof of concept shows that the method can successfully drive the contaminant localization in a complex marine environment by controlling a group of autonomous underwater vehicles.

Here the authors use attosecond X-ray spectroscopy to follow this process in the silane cation, observing how the distortion splits into one coherent and one stochastic pathway. 
 A fundamental approach to understanding chemical processes involves two key concepts: reaction paths and vibrational wavepackets. Collecting sufficient observables to experimentally determine these paths still challenges the latest advances in ultrafast science. Simultaneously observing the coherent nature of the wavepacket following them is even more challenging. Here, exploiting the sub-femtosecond time resolution (σ = 1 fs) of attosecond soft-X-ray-absorption spectroscopy, we overcome both of these challenges and observe a Jahn-Teller-mediated chemical reaction in its entirety—from initial symmetry breaking to beyond dissociation. We find that the Jahn-Teller effect in

These unprecedented insights into an ultrafast Jahn-Teller-mediated chemical reaction establish the unique potential of our experimental scheme for investigating chemical processes, particularly ones containing non-adiabatic dynamics or involving hydrogen atoms, which are notoriously difficult to detect with other methods, such as electron or X-ray diffraction.

 According to the World Meteorological Organization, 2023 was ranked as the second warmest year in the global surface temperature record since 1850, setting warm surface temperature records over more than 20% of the global land surface. In particular, the southwestern United States (US) and Northern Mexico experienced their longest stretch of record-breaking heat wave, affecting over 100 million people, causing over 200 deaths, and $14.5 billion in economic loss. Here we show that the 2023 heat wave event was linked to a strong anticyclonic blocking pattern that persisted for more than six weeks across the western US. Regression analysis and atmospheric model simulations suggest that the anticyclonic pattern was ultimately forced by the extremely warm sea surface temperature in the Atlantic. The combination of a warm Atlantic and a developing Pacific El Niño significantly amplified regional heat waves, doubling their number, tripling their days, and increasing their duration by about 50%.

 Samples from the carbonaceous asteroid Ryugu and CI (Ivuna-type) chondrites are dominated by low-temperature, aqueously formed secondary minerals, with rare occurrences of anhydrous primary minerals that formed in the high-temperature region of the solar protoplanetary disk. Here, we show that small (<a few tens of micrometers) Ca-Al-rich inclusions (CAIs) in Ryugu and Ivuna formed within ~0.2 Ma of the Solar System’s birth. These CAIs exhibit mineralogical, O-isotopic, and chronological similarities to CAIs in ordinary and other carbonaceous chondrites, indicating their ubiquitous presence across chondrites. In contrast, larger (>submillimeter) CAIs, commonly found in other carbonaceous chondrites and thought to have been retained via pressure bump(s) in the disk, are absent in Ryugu and CI chondrites. This absence implies that their parent planetesimals formed at a greater heliocentric distance, beyond the influence of a pressure bump created by proto-Jupiter, accreting only small CAIs that evaded radial drift toward the Sun.

 Debris flows are one of the most damaging natural hazards in mountainous terrain. Their dynamics are controlled by both surging behaviour and the influence of large boulders. However, a lack of high-resolution field measurements has limited our mechanistic understanding of these important processes. Here, we provide high-resolution in situ debris-flow surge measurements that demonstrate that surges are formed by the spontaneous growth of small surface instabilities into large waves, which amplify the destructiveness of the flow by increasing peak discharge. We use our field measurements to invert for the effective basal friction experienced by the flow, and support this reconstruction using numerical simulations that reproduce the formation and propagation of the surges. Detailed analysis of the inverted frictional data further shows that large boulders in the flow can influence local flow dynamics by increasing basal resistance, but this is not required to drive the surge wave instability. Our analysis provides new insights into debris-flow dynamics and can provide the foundation for improved hazard management of these damaging processes.

 Wildfires in the Arctic are accelerating ecosystem damage and increasing global carbon emissions. Siberia, a major Arctic wildfire hotspot, is shaped by both local weather and distant climate influences. Here we use climate reanalysis data and numerical model experiments to show that summer wildfires in Siberia are strongly influenced by rainfall patterns over the Tibetan Plateau, one of the Northern Hemisphere’s largest summer heat sources. A dipole in Tibetan Plateau rainfall—wetter in the west, drier in the east—coincides with more fires in central Siberia and fewer in the east. This pattern alters high-altitude winds, shifting the jet stream northward and generating air flow changes that create favorable fire conditions across Siberia. Model experiments support a causal link. The resulting carbon dioxide emissions can match annual emissions from all Nordic countries. These findings highlight an overlooked driver of Arctic wildfires and improve our understanding of their role in the global carbon cycle.

 Since Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) was launched in 2014, Interferometric Wide swath (IW) mode Level-2 radial velocity (RVL) products have been widely used to map fine-scale ocean surface current (OSC) in coastal zones. However, RVL product applications are restricted by non-geophysical and Wind-wave Induced Artifact Surface Velocity (WASV) errors. Previous studies have focused on improving the current retrieval accuracy in coastal zones, while neglecting open ocean regions and insufficient uncertainty analysis. To address these issues, a non-geophysical correction scheme suitable for both coastal and open sea is proposed by considering land coverage within SAR scenes. Corrected RVL products are validated using 1282 drifters and 78,054 HF radar points collected from the U.S. East Coast, West Coast, and Hawaiian Islands, showing overall accuracy improvements exceeding 60 %. To investigate the impact of WASV correction under different sea states (e.g. pure wind wave, wind wave dominant mix sea, swell dominant mix sea, and pure swell), a total of 127,534 matching points collected from January 2018 to May 2019 are used to assess the performance of four correction schemes. These include CDOP, KaDOP with wind and swell inputs, KaDOP with wind and wind-sea inputs, and CDOP-Yn. A comprehensive comparison with HF radar current reveals that CDOP performs poorly in pure wind wave sea (RMSE up to 0.34 m/s), while incorporating sea state parameters enhances the retrieval accuracy. KaDOP and CDOP-Yn yield comparable performance, while KaDOP performs better in pure wind or wind wave dominant mix sea, achieving RMSE of 0.21 m/s and a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.62.

 Automated mapping and change analysis of urban land use are crucial tasks for examining the patterns of urban development and effectively directing the sustainable management of urban land resources. High-resolution (HR) remote sensing imagery offers abundant spatial details and clear urban structures. However, the existing change detection methods require high-quality paired samples and are based on the assumption that the training and test data are independent and identically distributed, and thus lack the flexibility to generalize the trained model to new temporal images. In response to the challenge, a multi-temporal urban scene classification and change detection (MtUS-CCD) framework is proposed to realize urban land-use mapping and change analysis, with the real geographic boundaries provided by OpenStreetMap (OSM) road networks. The key model of the proposed MtUS-CCD framework is the deep geospatial-temporal Adaptation Network based on partial self-traIning and geospatial-Temporal Alignment (ANITA). The ANITA model employs a geospatial-temporal alignment (GTA) strategy to align the geographical locations of multi-temporal images, acquiring deep features that are invariant to temporal domain shifts. Label migration and self-training classification (STC) are also performed to enhance the model's discriminative capacity for cross-temporal urban scene classification in images obtained from new time phases. To relieve the significant scale differences and high shape variability among urban parcels, the ANITA model leverages the area-weighted voting (AWV) strategy to achieve land-use mapping based on the multi-temporal comprehensive OSM road network data. Subsequently, post-classification comparison (PCC) enables the acquisition of the land-use change directions. The experimental results obtained on tri-temporal datasets from China demonstrate that the MtUS-CCD framework shows a significant improvement in cross-temporal urban scene classification and change detection tasks conducted in different regions. Furthermore, this framework shows robust effectiveness and generalization in a large-scale application for the whole of the city of Wuhan in China. Through comparative analysis with policy planning, it is demonstrated that the urban development patterns inferred by this framework are accurate and reliable, providing strong support for the realization of sustainable development goals."

 Clouds are a key factor influencing transmission of the radiance signal in optical remote sensing images. For mapping or monitoring the Earth's surface, it is inevitable to mask or remove clouds before applying optical remote sensing images. Nowadays, deep learning (DL) based thin cloud removal methods far outperform traditional methods. Yet these DL-based methods often overlook position information or the physical cloud model in thermal bands. Moreover, most existing cloud physical models for cloud removal overlook the down-transmittance of the cloud in optical bands and do not account for the radiance of thermal bands. This work proposes a novel transformer network, CloudRuler, coupled with three rules in remote sensing domain for cloud removal. The proposed CloudRuler can distinguish the semantic meanings between similar features in different pixel positions by utilizing the Half-Spherical Coordinate System, aggregating features from local neighborhood windows with remote sensing mosaicking, and solving the parameters of the cloud physical model without limitations. Experimental results on 20 paired Landsat 8 and 9 images demonstrate that CloudRuler outperforms seven baseline methods, based on GAN, CNN, and transformer, both visually and quantitatively. Ablation experiments demonstrate that the proposed rule-based modules are highly effective in improving CloudRuler's performance for thin cloud removal. This work demonstrates that the joint use of Landsat 8 and 9 images for cloud removal is effective, producing more reliable data for downstream applications than methods that utilize only one satellite with a longer revisit period.

 This study evaluates the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of different Earth Observation (EO) products for assessing olive trees’ health in a 6.2 ha orchard. We developed a digital crop mapping approach using high-resolution multispectral imagery from three sources: unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) at 2 cm spatial resolution, Mohammed VI satellite at 50 cm, and Sentinel-2 satellite at 10 m. Leaf chlorophyll content, measured for 75 trees using a SPAD meter, served as the dependent variable for predictive modeling and a proxy of trees’ health. Furthermore, three machine learning algorithms, Random Forest (RF), Cubist, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were employed to predict chlorophyll content. The RF model showed superior performance across all datasets, achieving the lowest RMSE values. While UAV data provided the highest spatial detail, capturing fine-scale health variations, it came at a significantly higher cost. The commercial Mohammed VI satellite data offered a balance between detail and coverage, potentially cost-effective for areas approaching its 100 km2 minimum purchase requirement. However, the free Sentinel-2 data showed competitive performance, particularly with the RF model (RMSE: 7.773, RPIQ: 1.251), suggesting its viability for large-scale monitoring. Spatial chlorophyll maps revealed distinct capabilities of each EO product in capturing orchard variability. Our findings highlight the trade-offs between EO product costs, resolutions, and predictive accuracy, providing crucial insights for selecting appropriate remote sensing approaches based on specific monitoring requirements and budget constraints. This research underscores the potential of integrating diverse EO products with advanced ML techniques for cost-effective and scalable olive tree health assessment, with implications for precision agriculture and sustainable orchard management.

 sUnderstanding the dynamic evolution of dry-wet transition events (DWTEs) at different time scales is significant in water resources planning, agricultural development, and disaster risk reduction in a changing climate. The   southeast coastal region of China has been identified as a hot spot; however, the evolution of DWTEs at different time scales is unclear. This study identified DWTEs in China's   southeast coastal region at monthly, seasonal, and semi-annual scales from 1961 to 2020 based on the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) over 30-, 90- and 180-day moving window, and the spatiotemporal evolution of the DWTEs' frequency, duration, and magnitude are explored. The potential influence of large-scale climate oscillations, including the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) on the magnitude of DWTEs at the 30-day scale was assessed using Bayesian quantile regression. The results reveal (1) Extreme dry events were more prevalent and intense in the southern coastal area, whereas extreme wet events occurred predominantly and were more intense in the northern area. (2) High-frequency, high-magnitude DWTEs occurred along the coast at all time scales, and as the time scale increased, events with short duration shifted from the coast to the inland region. At the 30- and 90-day time scales, frequency generally decreased while magnitude increased, with the duration shortening in most regions. This indicates that the risk of DWTEs at short time scales has intensified over the past 60 years. (3) Strong large-scale climate oscillations significantly affected the DWTEs' magnitude.

These three areas combined cover 35% of the global range of carnivores. Reducing human pressure on conservation lands and managing them to protect carnivores are therefore critical, yet challenging.

Using an established twin pair analytical strategy, the genetic and environmental influences on immunological traits were evaluated, along with their association with atopy. Our findings suggest strong genetic influence on several traits, particularly B cell abundance. In contrast, cytokine responses from in vitro stimulations appeared mainly shaped by environmental exposures. Regarding associations with atopy, greater abundance of both B cells and basophils were observed in atopic individuals as well as increased expression of the immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor.

Ti-mitoEVs that contain abundant functional mitochondria can be highly efficiently isolated from muscles via an optimized method.

The peach-potato aphidMyzus persicaeis a generalist, feeding on many plant species and capable of transmitting numerous pathogens. This study reveals how host-responsive cathepsin B (CathB) proteins in the oral secretions ofM. persicaefacilitate aphid survival by modulating plant immune responses. Host-responsive CathB proteins localize to plant processing bodies (p-bodies), cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granules involved in messenger RNA storage or decay. Upon localization, these CathB proteins recruit key immune regulators EDS1, PAD4, and ADR1 to these bodies, suppressing plant defenses. A plant protein, Acd28.9 (Hsp20 family), counteracts this CathB activity and contributes to plant resistance to aphids. These findings highlight an unexpected role for p-bodies in plant immunity and uncover a plant resistance mechanism to aphid infestation."

Recently, the interaction of WNKs with nuclear receptor binding protein 1 (NRBP1) and transforming growth factor–β–stimulated clone 22 domain (TSC22D) proteins was reported. Here, we explored the effect of NRBP1 and TSC22Ds on WNK signaling in vitro and in the DCT. TSC22D1.1, TSC22D2, and NRBP1 are localized in DCT WNK bodies, which are cytoplasmic biomolecular condensates associated with WNK activation. In HEK293 cells, long TSC22D isoforms and NRBP1 increase WNK4 activity. DCT-specific NRBP1-knockout mice have reduced NCC phosphorylation and activate a compensatory response. Thus, NRBP1 and long TSC22D proteins are positive modulators of WNK signaling and modulate Na+reabsorption in the kidney. NRBP1 and TSC22Ds likely influence WNK signaling in other tissues, affecting various physiological processes."

However, challenges such as limited force output and inefficient force transfer at tissue interfaces persist. The myotendinous junction, a specialized interface connecting muscle to the tendon, plays a critical role in efficient force transmission for movement. Engineering muscle-tendon units in vitro is essential for replicating native musculoskeletal functions in biohybrid actuators. Here, we present a three-dimensionally bioprinted system integrating skeletal muscle tissue with tendon-mimicking anchors containing fibroblasts, forming a biomimetic interdigitated myotendinous junction.

Using a proximity labeling approach, we found that osmotic stress promotes the association of WNK1 with the NRBP1 pseudokinase and TSC22D2/4 adaptor proteins, results that are confirmed by immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and immunoblotting studies. NRBP1 pseudokinase is closely related to WNK isoforms and contains a RΦ-motif–binding conserved C-terminal (CCT) domain, like the CCT domains in WNKs, SPAK, and OXSR1. Knockdown or knockout of NRBP1 markedly inhibited basal as well as sorbitol-induced activation of WNK1 and downstream components. We demonstrate that recombinant NRBP1 can directly induce the activation of WNK4 in vitro. AlphaFold-3 modeling predicts that WNK1, SPAK, NRBP1, and TSC22D4 form a complex, in which two TSC22D4 RΦ-motifs interact with the CCTL1 domain of WNK1 and the CCT domain of NRBP1.

In this study, we used heterochronic parabiosis (HP) combined with single-cell RNA sequencing to generate comprehensive transcriptomic profiles of murine retinas from young, aged, and HP pairs, aiming to identify antiaging targets. Our analysis revealed extensive transcriptional alterations across retinal cell types with aging. HP experiments demonstrated that systemic factors from young mice rejuvenated aged retinas and alleviated senescent phenotypes, while aged blood accelerated aging in young mice. Integrative analysis pinpointed adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and the downstream adenosine 5′-monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway as central to the molecular mechanisms underlying retinal rejuvenation. Treatment with the AdipoR1 agonist AdipoRon reversed retinal aging. Mechanistically, AdipoR1-AMPK activation promoted mitochondrial function, contributing to the restoration of youthful cellular phenotypes. Together, our study identifies AdipoR1 as a therapeutic target for retinal aging and provides insights into the molecular programs driving retinal rejuvenation."

The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) represents reward attributes, such as delay and magnitude, alongside expected uncertainties about upcoming rewards, serving its established role in both value- and risk-based behaviors. However, the cellular basis of how reward and uncertainty interact remains unclear. To investigate, we trained rats on a task where odor cues predicted sucrose rewards with varying uncertainties in delay or magnitude. Single-unit recordings revealed that many OFC neurons encoded expected uncertainties related to reward delay or magnitude. Population-level analysis showed distinct neural codes for delay and magnitude uncertainties, separate from those for reward delay and magnitude. Signals for each reward attribute and associated uncertainty converged onto the same neurons, reducing the sensitivity of delay and magnitude encoding as uncertainty increased. These findings suggest a cellular-level computation in OFC neurons, whereby uncertainty signals are integrated into attribute-specific reward representations, potentially supporting flexible learning and risk control."

We observe excited self-ordered subradiant patterns in a quantum gas coupled to two optical cavities and report lifetimes far beyond the system’s typical timescales. These patterns eventually decay through an abrupt transition reordering the atoms into a superradiant phase. Ab initio theory fully captures this macroscopic behavior, revealing that the subradiant patterns are stabilized by photon-mediated long-range interactions, thereby manifesting universal features of metastability characteristic of long-range interacting systems, as in astrophysics and plasma physics. Our work sheds light on the microscopic mechanisms stabilizing quantum states of matter and highlights the potential of photon-mediated forces for engineering correlations in many-body quantum systems."

The strong electronic interaction in PdBOx@Pd/CNTs induces the hybridization between Pd(d), B(s, p), and O(s, p) atom orbits, optimizing the adsorption of reactants and intermediates, thus enhancing the activity for the GOR. The density functional theory calculation result reveals that the strong electronic interaction in PdBOx@Pd/CNTs facilitates the hydrogen transfer in the primary C─H bond of the CH2OHCHOHCH2O* intermediate, thus reducing the energy barrier of the rate-determining step and improving glyceric acid selectivity toward the GOR."

We have developed and characterized a small-molecule MYC inhibitor named MYCi975. To uncover combination strategies for MYC inhibitors, we conducted a genome-wide CRISPR screen using MYCi975. This screen revealed a notable synthetic lethality when MYC inhibition was paired with disruption of mitochondrial complex I components, but not other complexes. Mechanistically, MYC inhibition reduced oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, triggering a compensatory up-regulation of complex I genes. Consequently, genetic or pharmacological targeting of complex I sensitized tumors to MYCi975 treatment, leading to increased purine catabolism and infiltration of CD8+T cells and macrophages into tumors. Additionally, a wide range of tumor cells with lower complex I expression showed increased MYC dependency.

This enhancement arises from the lower energy barriers for dipole flipping and domain switching associated with BDs, in comparison to conventional domain structures. Under an applied electric field, the rotation of polarized BDs, combined with a reduction in dipole flux due to the articulated rotation between BDs and surrounding domains, further amplifies the strain response.

Using this framework, we fabricated elastomeric robotic actuators and demonstrated 3D printing with direct ink writing. The actuators achieved 50% higher curvature with the same design, and the 3D-printed parts exhibited over 200% improvement in interlayer adhesion. This work serves as a tool for optimizing interfacial adhesion for soft materials across different fabrication approaches."
10.1126/sciadv.ado8664,False,Science Advances,该研究论文主要关注苔藓植物在高重力环境下的适应机制，特别是通过AP2/ERF转录因子介导的光合作用增强。研究探讨了陆地植物进化过程中重力、光合作用和基因调控之间的关系。虽然光合作用与大气中的二氧化碳浓度有关，但该研究并未直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术的关联性较弱。,[],Yuko T.

Bryophytes underwent major changes in physiology, anatomy, and growth during their emergence onto land. However, the link between gravity, photosynthesis, and genetic control remains unclear. Here, we show that leaf carbon dioxide diffusion enhanced photosynthesis in the model mossPhyscomitrium patensunder increased gravity (6 and 10 times Earth’s gravity), driven by increases in plant (gametophore) number and chloroplast size. RNA sequencing analysis showed that 10 gravity up-regulated several species-specific APETALA2/ethylene-responsive factor (AP2/ERF) transcription factors. Overexpression of one suchAP2/ERF,ISSUNBOSHI1(IBSH1; gene ID =Pp3c1_32440), inP. patensphenocopied plants grown at 10 gravity, and the dominant repressor form of IBSH1 suppressed 10 gravity responses. These results provide evidence that the proliferation of AP2/ERF transcription factors and the establishment of a notable gene network may have been important in adaptation to the terrestrial environment during land plant evolution."
10.1126/sciadv.adx7335,False,Science Advances,该论文主要研究的是一种利用飞秒激光和数字微镜器件进行五维光数据并行写入的方法，旨在提高光存储的速度和容量。它通过控制投影光点的形状，并行写入具有不同慢轴方位角的双折射体素，并实现了多层数据的并行写入和读取。该技术主要应用于数据存储领域，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测、大气成分分析等）没有直接关联。,[],Minxin Ye;Yuhao Lei;Xin Zhang;Lei Wang;Shih-Chi Chen,Parallel writing of 5D optical data via shaped voxels,"Multidimensional optical data storage is a critically needed technology in the digital era. To overcome the low data writing rate in the conventional systems, we present a parallel five-dimensional optical data writing method by projecting arrays of depth-resolved voxels of different shapes via a digital micromirror device and temporally focusing a femtosecond laser amplifier. This is more efficient than the conventional approach that serially creates birefringent voxels in glass (e.g., nanogratings or oblate nanopores) via scanning an ultrafast laser while varying its polarizations. We demonstrated parallel writing of 16 by 16 birefringent voxels with eight different slow-axis azimuths by controlling the shapes of the projected light spots. Next, we demonstrated five-layer parallel data writing with 100% readout accuracy and a 1.5-terabyte storage capacity per disc. With a high repetition rate femtosecond laser amplifier (e.g., 100 kilohertz), our method may achieve a theoretical writing speed of 7.5 megabytes per second, paving the way for high-speed, high-capacity optical data storage."
