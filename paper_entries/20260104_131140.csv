Desalination, particularly through reverse osmosis (RO), has become a critical method of producing fresh water from saline sources. However, thin-film composite (TFC) polyamide (PA) RO membranes, the industrial desalination standard, have a high propensity for biofilm formation, which leads to biofouling, reducing efficiency and increasing energy demand. Ozone disinfection is a simple, effective method to control biofilm development; however, PA membranes undergo chemical degradation when exposed to oxidizing disinfectants, even at very low concentrations. This work presents a novel approach to enhancing the durability of TFC-PA membranes against ozone. This was achieved by applying ultrathin alumina coatings via atomic layer deposition (ALD) on the membrane surface, creating a protective layer that provides active and passive defense against oxidative damage. The thin-film alumina-coated membrane at optimal coating demonstrated 5-fold higher tolerance to ozone exposure than uncoated membranes. They also maintained stable water permeate flux and salt rejection after prolonged filtration and effectively prevented biofilm formation. These findings offer a promising pathway to enhancing the sustainability of RO membranes by addressing critical barriers to their long-term desalination performance, thereby contributing to addressing the problem of global water scarcity."

Through comparative Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) analysis of the Lancang River’s natural and impounded reaches, we identified 9,410 molecular formulas that reveal systematic reservoir-induced transformations in DOM architecture. Notably, 531 compounds were reservoir-specific, exhibiting distinct molecular signatures with reduced double bond equivalence (DBE), elevated H/C ratios, and enrichment in peptide-/lipid-like components, indicative of enhanced autochthonous production. Phytoplankton community analysis revealed the reservoir-specific dominance of Chlorophyta and Cyanophyta, whose metabolic activities promoted the biosynthesis of aliphatic components and unsaturated compounds. Reaction networks uncover intensified anaerobic processing in reservoirs, where demethylation and dehydrogenation pathways generate methane precursors, potentially amplifying CH4 flux. Carbon oxidation state (NOSC) emerges as a key molecular selector, with redox-selected preservation of low-energy CHO compounds (NOSC < 0) forming refractory carbon pools, while bioavailable CHON species demonstrate significant correlations of sediment organic carbon with biological index and peptide-like content. These molecular-level insights suggest that cascade reservoirs simultaneously process organic matter through microbial carbon pumps and sequester carbon via selective molecular preservation, benefiting from optimizing hydropower management in riverine ecosystems."

McBeath,"Contribution of a Storm Event to Disinfection Byproduct Formation: Natural Organic Matter Sources, Characteristics, and Mobilization","This study investigates the relationship between storm-driven changes in natural organic matter (NOM) and disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation. The novel framework presented correlates specific differential absorbance at 254 nm (Sp-ΔUV254), which measures the change in UV254 due to chlorination normalized by initial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, with critical water quality parameters such as chlorine demand, DBP formation, size-fractionated NOM, and lignin to enhance mechanistic understandings of DBP precursor dynamics. To evaluate the impact of a storm on the DBP precursor dynamics, samples were collected from the Neversink River (NY) during a high-flow event. The formation of total trihalomethanes (THMs), or specific trihalomethanes (Sp-THM) when normalized by initial DOC, strongly correlated to Sp-ΔUV254. The pre- and postchlorinated samples’ quotients of absorbances at 250 and 365 nm (E2/E3) yielded a strong correlation despite a decreased ΔUV254 due to chlorination, suggesting dissolved organic matter transformation to less aromatic structures, in agreement with size exclusion chromatography (SEC) data. A novel SEC-DOC technique showed THM precursors increased during the rising limb of the storm with a predominant molecular weight range of 2000–10,000 Da. Stable water isotope (δ18O) measurements suggest quick mobilization of stored NOM accumulated in the watershed, which was also supported by quantified lignin concentrations."

Lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxides (NCM), the predominant cathode materials in modern LIBs, are of particular concern because of their high content of redox-active transition metals (TMs). Nevertheless, their dissolution behavior and underlying molecular mechanisms under environmentally relevant conditions are poorly understood. In this study, we systematically examined four commercial NCM compositions (NCM111, 523, 622, and 811) under environmentally relevant variables, including pH, temperature, salinity, and organic ligands. Lithium ions (Li+) exhibited high solubility across all conditions (>80%), whereas nickel ions (Ni2+), cobalt ions (Co2+), and manganese ions (Mn2+) demonstrated low but environmentally sensitive release (∼2%). Compared with temperature, salinity, and humic acid, metal dissolution was governed primarily by pH and citric acid. Density functional theory (DFT), combined with the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model, revealed that environmental factors influence the dissolution free energy (ΔG) through proton attack, ligand binding, ionic strength, and lattice destabilization. Experiments conducted in six representative waters further confirmed enhanced Ni2+ and Co2+ release in acidic, organic-rich leachates. Collectively, these findings provide mechanistic insights into NCM dissolution pathways and contribute to risk assessment and sustainable management strategies for spent LIBs."

In the present study, we combined cellular physiology, transcriptomics, and quantitative lipidomics to test how nitrate or ammonium enrichment alters coral responses to ocean warming. The findings indicated that nitrate enrichment and an elevated temperature acted synergistically to aggravate oxidative stress and exacerbate bleaching. Under heat stress, nitrate reduced photosynthetic membrane lipids, ceramides, and coenzyme Q, lowering photosynthetic efficiency in Symbiodiniaceae, and induced upregulation of genes for pro-inflammatory lipid biosynthesis in the coral host. By contrast, ammonium enrichment and elevated temperature acted antagonistically to reduce susceptibility to bleaching. Under heat stress, ammonium increased photosynthetic membrane lipids and photosynthetic efficiency in Symbiodiniaceae, while in the coral host, it decreased pro-inflammatory lipids, increased ceramide levels, upregulated genes involved in heat shock protein 70 orthologues, and re-established symbiosis. These divergent effects indicate that nitrate and ammonium activate distinct lipid-mediated pathways and stress responses that differentially regulate coral susceptibility to heat stress, with important implications for managing nitrogen pollution under ocean warming."

However, its implementation in real wastewater remains challenging, with limited strategies to address interference from coexisting ions. Here, we identify Mg2+ as a representative precipitation-prone impurity and demonstrate that pulsed electrolysis effectively alleviated its inhibitory effects. Under optimized pulsed conditions, the nitrate removal and ammonia yield rate reached 98.0% and 3544.7 μg h–1 cm–2, respectively, restoring the lost performance under static operation with Mg2+ (85.3% and 2821.5 μg h–1 cm–2) and matching the Mg2+-free baseline (96.1% and 3449.0 μg h–1 cm–2). Mechanistic studies revealed three key functions of pulsing: (i) suppression of local pH elevation, which limits Mg2+ precipitation and particle growth on the catalyst surface; (ii) dynamic modulation of interfacial ion distributions, reducing Mg2+ accumulation via electric-field-induced repulsion; and (iii) K+ enrichment at the interface, which increases the energy barrier (1.15 eV) for Mg2+ adsorption and enhances NO3– conversion. The pulsed strategy also effectively mitigated cationic interference in complex multi-ion wastewater analogs, demonstrating its broad applicability. Our findings uncover the mechanistic basis of pulsed electrolysis-induced ion redistribution in complex water matrices, establishing a generalizable framework to enhance the eNO3RR and other electrocatalytic water treatment processes under realistic conditions."

This study investigated the foliar interactions between negatively charged NPs and two mangroves with contrasting salt-regulation strategies: the salt-secreting Aegiceras corniculatum and the salt-excluding K. candel. The findings indicated that the salt glands in A. corniculatum leaves functioned as NP accumulation hotspots, with a 53.2%–54.1% higher particle density than adjacent epidermal cells. This preferential retention was attributed to the glandular micromorphology and π–π stacking–mediated interfacial adhesion. Critically, salt glands provided entry points for NP internalization in A. corniculatum, allowing rootward translocation at 0.378–0.547 mg kg–1 d–1. Conversely, the absence of salt glands in K. candel resulted in complete NP interception by its cuticular layer, restricting internal migration. The differential NP localization patterns further induced species-specific photosynthetic impairment mechanisms. Cuticular NP shielding inhibited the light reaction in K. candel by reducing photon capture efficiency and disrupting electron transport. However, salt gland–facilitated NP internalization triggered dark reaction failure in A. corniculatum, as evidenced by 35.1 to 68.3% downregulation of carbon fixation genes. Our results reveal the role of salt-secreting mangroves as biological concentrators in the global NP cycle and bridge microscale plastic–plant interactions with macroscale carbon–climate feedbacks, redefining mangrove ecosystems as critical nodes in the plastisphere."

Misra;Iseult Lynch,Mapping the Hierarchical Environmental Transformations of Nanoscale UiO-66 Metal–organic Framework,"Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) hold immense potential for applications from separations to catalysis, yet their long-term behavior across real-world environments remains unclear. Here we introduce a hierarchical exposure framework that tracks the structural and chemical transformations in the archetypal zirconium MOF UiO-66 across sequential compartments─atmospheric gases, air, aqueous media and a biological host─and resolves how prior exposures condition or prime subsequent transformations. Using synchrotron-based spectroscopy, we find that oxidative/reactive gases leave the Zr-carboxylate nodes essentially intact, whereas exposure to environmentally relevant aqueous media initiates partial shifts in local Zr coordination and introduces oxygen into the pores─with transformation extent governed by the chemistry of the environmental matrices. Strikingly, acute exposure (24 h) to the water flea Daphnia magna drives profound framework degradation and respeciation to Zr hydroxide species. Microfocus XRF maps show that Zr is highly localized in the animal’s digestive tract, and region-specific XANES confirms uniform speciation across its tissues. Our findings establish a paradigm shifting cross-compartment transformation hierarchy in which biological processes can dominate the fate of stable MOFs even when abiotic exposures appear benign. Thus, organism-level biotransformation should be performed as a necessary part of environmental safety assessments and materials design."

Observation-based (top-down) verification of this phase-out requires quantification of the CFC-12 emissions using atmospheric observations, which have been notably lacking post-2020 for China. In this study, 6814 new high-frequency in situ atmospheric observations of CFC-12 from three Chinese stations in 2024 were analyzed. Combining these observations with inverse modeling, we quantified China’s most recent CFC-12 emissions and revealed a 72% decline, from 12.7 ± 2.2 gigagrams per year (Gg yr–1) in 2016 to 3.6 ± 0.8 Gg yr–1 in 2024. We also developed a new bottom-up inventory, which generally reconciles the discrepancy between observation-based estimates and previous inventories. From a global perspective, this study provides the first country-specific, observation-based estimates of CFC-12 emissions for 2024, accounting for 22.6% of the global CFC-12 emissions. In contrast, for other countries, no observation-based CFC-12 emissions exist, or only a few pre-2022 data are available. Approximately three-quarters (77.4%) of global CFC-12 emissions remain unattributed. These findings highlight both China’s success in mitigating CFC-12 emissions, contributing to ozone layer protection and climate mitigation, and the need for enhanced emission quantification across other regions."

However, research on HV-POPs remains limited, particularly in rapidly urbanizing regions, constraining understanding of their sources, environmental fate, and risks. This study investigated 52 HV-POPs, including Stockholm Convention-listed POPs like hexachlorobutadiene (HCBD) and hexa-/pentachlorobenzene (HCB/PeCB), and nonlisted HV-POPs such as volatile methylsiloxanes (VMS) and chlorinated nitrobenzenes (CNBs), using active air samplers in six major cities across Asia and Africa. The median total concentrations of HV-POPs were highest in Guangzhou (351 ng/m3), followed by Kuala Lumpur (167 ng/m3), Accra (82.4 ng/m3), Dhaka (73.3 ng/m3), Nairobi (44.9 ng/m3), and Islamabad (33.5 ng/m3). VMS dominated at all sites, accounting for 84 ± 18% of total HV-POPs, up to 2–5 orders of magnitude higher than other compounds. Source analysis showed VMS emissions in Guangzhou were mainly from industrial activities, while in the other cities, they were from usage of personal care products. Inhalation risk assessments indicated negligible noncarcinogenic and carcinogenic risks at all sites. This study provides the first multiregional HV-POPs data set in urban air, supporting chemical risk assessment efforts and broader international regulatory initiatives."

Here, we reveal a structure-dependent photolysis mechanism of NPs adsorbed on photoactive particulate matter. The visible photolysis rates of representative NPs, such as J4-nitroguaiacol > J4-nitrocatechol > J5-nitrosalicylic acid, span 3 orders of magnitude, closely linked to the chemical reactivity of the nitro group (−NO2) site in NPs. The interfacial photochemistry process shows differential depletion of the −NO2 groups, consistent with their relative reactivities. Calculated average local ionization energy (ALIE) values serve as a predictive descriptor of visible photolysis potential, with lower ALIE correlating with faster photolysis. Validation across 10 atmospheric NPs supports the universal correlation between the visible photolysis rate and ALIE value, enabling prioritization of high-risk species and offering molecular-level insight into the photochemical transformation of complex organic pollutants."

In this study, the effects of FCDs and glucose CDs on feeding behavior in mice were elucidated from the perspectives of gut microbiome, metabolic flow monitoring, and metabolomics. The results demonstrated that persistent intake of FCDs (25 mg/kg/day) for 30 days significantly caused diminished appetite. Mechanistic findings suggested that FCDs were involved in the regulation of appetite reduction through the microbiota–gut–brain axis. FCDs induce perturbations in the gut microbiota, leading to increased levels of intestinal inflammation. In addition, the intake of FCDs was directly involved in microbial metabolism to generate SCFAs, activate intestinal GPR-41/43, promote the release of glucagon-like peptide, and further stimulate the hypothalamus to significantly downregulate the expression of AGRP and upregulate the expression of POMC, ultimately leading to the reduction of appetite. Moreover, intake of FCDs regulates intestinal fatty acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and other factors affecting the level of health of the organism. The present work highlights the impact of dietary intake of source FCDs on ingestion, providing unique perspectives on the potential health threats of FCDs."

The Central China water tower (CCWT) is the key source region feeding the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, and its runoff is indispensable for the surrounding mega‐city clusters. Here we present a reconstruction of CCWT runoff depth (RD) back to 1595 CE, based on a new dendrochronological network including 100 tree‐ring sampling sites and an ensemble averaging approach that combines multiple regression models. Comparison of this reconstruction with similar records from six water tower regions along the Pacific Rim (Mongolian Plateau, Tibetan Plateau TP, Great Dividing Range, Southern and Northern Rocky Mountains, Andes Mountains) revealed that the CCWT provide the most stable water supply, while the TP to be most susceptible to extreme runoff events. Twenty‐first century projections indicate generally increasing runoff across most Pacific Rim water towers, whereas the Northern Rocky Mountains are projected to decline substantially. We attribute the differences in runoff variability and projected trends across Pacific Rim water towers to their distinct geographies and synoptic climatic conditions. The long‐term runoff reconstructions and projected changes highlighted in this study provide insights for adaptive management strategies in China and all other regions relying on supply from mountain water towers."

The existence of cratonic basins indicates protracted periods of tectonic modification, causing subsidence within global continental interiors. An enigmatic aspect of this process is the cessation of subsidence in cratonic basins with unclear mechanisms. Here, using full‐wave ambient noise tomography, we reveal distinct seismic low‐velocity anomalies below 60 km beneath the Illinois and Michigan Basins, where subsidence terminated in the late Paleozoic to the early Mesozoic. These low‐velocity volumes, surrounded by distinctly higher velocities, are attributed to asthenospheric materials upwelling to shallow mantle depths during lithospheric foundering or delamination. This lithospheric modification may be associated with a major regional tectonic exhumation in the early Mesozoic that could have terminated basin subsidence and unroofed upper portions of basin stratigraphy. This timing coincides with the passage of this region over mantle plumes, which likely triggered lithospheric delamination and asthenospheric upwelling. Geodynamic modeling shows that the emplacement of these buoyant asthenospheric materials would lead to an uplift of about 3.5 km, sufficient to terminate the subsidence in the cratonic basins within this region. These findings document evidence of lithospheric delamination in the North American midcontinent and present important links between geodynamic drivers and geological records of the evolution of the cratonic lithosphere in North America and beyond. They also offer broader implications for understanding how deep Earth processes shape surface environments, influencing resource distribution and long‐term landscape evolution."

Two main approaches exist: dynamical downscaling using high‐resolution regional climate models, and statistical downscaling based on historical relationships between large‐scale and local variables. In a recent analysis of five dynamically downscaled simulations over the western United States, Koszuta et al. (2024, https://doi.org/10.1029/2023gl107298) found that warming weakens orographic influence on winter precipitation, damping increases on windward slopes and amplifying them in rain‐shadowed regions. Here we show that this effect is robust across seasons and multiple dynamically downscaled ensembles, and is more pronounced at higher model resolutions. However, it is absent in projections from a widely used statistical model (LOCA2), even when trained on high‐resolution future simulations (LOCA2‐Hybrid). This highlights a key limitation of many statistical downscaling methods: their preservation of parent GCM trends, which usually fail to capture emergent changes in orographic precipitation patterns."

The luminous channel of an UI stroke does not connect to the main channel, which gives this phenomenon its name. Since concurrent branches in positive CG strokes are not usual, positive UI (+UI) strokes were never reported yet. This study presents the first observations of +UI strokes. They were recorded in Utah, USA, using high‐speed cameras. Although +UI strokes share similarities with negative UI strokes, their initiation mechanisms are fundamentally different. +UI strokes result from intense recoil leader activity with their positive leader speed one order of magnitude slower than the average of typical CG downward positive leaders. Additionally, multiple +UI strokes can occur within the same flash. Finally, we gather all the information learned from the case studies to propose the basic formation mechanisms of +UI strokes."

Recent observations have revealed a distinctly weak overturning in this basin, attributed to compensating effects of temperature and salinity anomalies on density. However, it remains unclear whether these effects are consistent under varying hydrographic conditions and whether they subsequently impact overturning variability. By combining moored observations and historical hydrographic data, we demonstrate a coherent response of the Labrador Sea overturning to salinity anomalies over recent decades. Notably, a strengthened overturning in the late 2010s can be attributed to subsurface fresh anomalies advected into the basin by the boundary currents, which are linked to large‐scale freshening that began in the late 2000s. Our findings underscore the necessity of continuously monitoring boundary salinity and temperature anomalies to capture ongoing changes in the Labrador Sea."

However, the local and global drivers and variability of mangrove CH4 emissions remain poorly understood. Here, we quantify water‐atmosphere CH4 emissions over hourly, daily, and weekly time scales in an Australian mangrove ecosystem. We then combine our new observations with earlier data sets to link temperature and mangrove CH4 emissions on the global scale. The water‐atmosphere CH4 emissions were partially controlled by temperature on both local and global scales. One degree warming increased mangrove water‐atmosphere CH4 emissions by ∼23% locally and ∼13% globally. Globally scaled water‐atmosphere CH4 emissions (0.07–0.10 Tg C yr−1) currently offset 6%–8% of mangrove carbon burial. CH4 emissions are predicted to increase by 10%–33% by 2100 under global warming scenarios and tropicalization. Therefore, mangrove CH4 emissions should be considered in blue carbon assessments in the context of global warming."

Using complex network theory and random forest models, this study analyzed the spatial synchronization characteristics, regional drivers, and propagation patterns of weekly SM drought events across China from 1979 to 2019. Results revealed drought events displayed higher spatial synchronization in eastern Tibet, northern Shaanxi, and southeastern and northeastern China, with average degree centrality (DC) exceeding 250. The drivers of drought event synchronization exhibited regional heterogeneity: precipitation (P, 24.1%), potential evapotranspiration (PET, 15.2%), and atmospheric pressure (PRS, 10.8%) were dominant in western China; P, zonal wind speed at 10 m height (WIN_10v), and terrain gradient contributed more to DC simulation in the northeastern region, with an average contribution of 7.7%; river area (RiA) was the primary factor affecting drought synchrony in southern China, contributing 15.1%, which was 2.4–3 times higher than relative humidity (RHU) and WIN_10v. Drought propagation analysis identified source regions in western Xinjiang and northern Tibet while sink zones were concentrated in eastern Tibet, western Sichuan, northern Guizhou, northeastern Jiangxi, and southeastern Heilongjiang Provinces. Droughts originating from northern Tibet predominantly propagated along the south‐southeast (SSE) direction, with a strength of 90 and distances ranging from 1,500 to 1,800 km. This study is valuable to enhance the understanding of the spatiotemporal patterns of SM droughts in China and highlight the potential of complex network approaches for agricultural drought monitoring and early warning."

The different states of coupling between low‐level clouds and the surface are uncertain, primarily over continental regions, where complex thermodynamics complicates their investigation. This study uses observations from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement User Facility to explore cloud‐surface coupling and perform a climatological analysis of this interaction in five countries across three continents. The results reveal consistent coupling thresholds and average percentages across the five sites, with coupled clouds accounting for 66% of the cases and decoupled clouds for 34%. Thermodynamic and dynamic evaluations show distinct differences between coupled and decoupled clouds. Coupled clouds are characterized by humid environments, in which vertical motions connect the surface and lower atmosphere to the cloud base, conditions that favor the formation of boundary layer clouds. Decoupled clouds prefer to occur in a drier and colder environment with vertical motions inside the boundary layer being detached from the cloud base, under which boundary layer clouds are hard to form. Coupled clouds peak during warmer hours and seasons, and vice versa for decoupled clouds. This study underscores the complexity of cloud‐land‐surface interactions and paves the way for further investigations into cloud formation and evolution under different atmospheric environments."

However, it remains unclear whether tree planting alters patterns and acclimation of hydraulic traits across spatial scales. Here, we compiled a site‐level data set of hydraulic traits in natural (NF) and planted forests (PF) to examine trait patterns and relationships, quantified environmental and ecological drivers on ecosystem‐scale hydraulic traits of PF and NF across China, and computationally projected future trait acclimation using the space‐for‐time approach. We identified distinct differences in hydraulic traits between NF and PF, with PF exhibiting higher hydraulic safety but lower hydraulic efficiency than NF at the species level. NF demonstrated a trade‐off between hydraulic efficiency and safety, whereas PF exhibited a contrasting positive correlation between these traits. We confirmed that both environmental and ecological factors influence ecosystem‐scale hydraulic traits in NF and PF, although dominant drivers vary among specific traits. Projections under future climate scenarios suggest that, despite persistent differences in trait acclimation between NF and PF, both forest types tend to exhibit increased water‐use efficiency and enhanced drought resistance in response to rising precipitation and air dryness. These findings provide a valuable benchmark for estimating potential changes in hydraulic traits under climate change, supporting improved simulations of carbon and water fluxes in response to climate and anthropogenic influences."

Therefore, given the increasing impacts of droughts on economic and environmental issues, understanding the baseflow drought (BFD) evolution and its drivers are critical. In this study, we quantify and analyze the long‐term evolution of BFD characteristics across the Contiguous United States. We use long‐term daily baseflow values of DeepBase data set and explainable machine learning models to identify and rank the climatic and physical drivers of BFD. Our analysis reveals notable regional disparities in BFDs, with western regions, particularly the Southwest, experiencing increased frequency and prolonged durations, while much of the eastern areas show declining trends. During the past decade, BFD frequency has been governed mainly by anomalies in the atmospheric water balance and by soil properties. Its duration has been primarily influenced by hydrogeologic attributes, and its intensity has been modulated most strongly by topographic setting. Highlighting the non‐stationary and complex nature of BFD mechanisms, our results have practical implications for water resource management and drought adaptation strategies."

Here, the authors show that intact TRLs, not just their remnants, promote atherosclerosis and vascular inflammation in a mouse model. 
 Increased fasting and postprandial triglyceride levels are risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Partially metabolized triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) termed remnants are created when intestinally-derived chylomicrons and liver secreted very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs) interact with lipoprotein lipase (LpL) situated on the luminal surface of capillary endothelial cells. Higher circulating remnant levels have been implicated as the reason for the relationship between TRL levels and CVD. We hypothesized that nascent lipoproteins not only remnants are atherogenic. To test this, we created mice with induced whole-body lipoprotein lipase (LpL) deficiency combined with LDL receptor (LDLR) deficiency. On an atherogenic Western-type diet (WD), male and female mice with induced global LpL deficiency (iLpl-/-) and LDLR knockdown (Ldlrkd) developed hypertriglyceridemia and elevated cholesterol levels; all the increased cholesterol was in chylomicrons or large VLDL. After 12 weeks on a WD, atherosclerotic lesions both in the brachiocephalic artery and the aortic root were more severe in iLpl-/-/Ldlrkd mice than control Ldlrkd mice. Aorta from hypertriglyceridemic mice had changes in the transcriptomes of endothelial cells, macrophages, and smooth muscle cells indicating vascular inflammation. Our data show that intact TRLs contribute to atherosclerosis, explain the association of postprandial lipemia and vascular disease and prove that non-remnant TRLs are not benign.

 Biological sex shapes the manifestation and progression of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), however, the underlying mechanisms remains unclear. Hemideletion of the 16p11.2 region (16p11.2 del/+) is associated with NDDs, and 16p11.2 del/+ mice exhibit sex-specific, striatum-related phenotypes relevant to NDDs. In this study, using snRNA-seq, we identify cell type- and sex-specific transcriptomic changes in D1- and D2-spiny projection neurons (SPNs), with greater impact in males. Fiber photometry recordings reveal reduced neuronal activity in the dorsal striatum of 16p11.2 del/+ males, but not females, with D2-SPNs identified as the primary contributors to this reduction. Behaviorally, we utilize conditional genetic approaches and find that selective hemideletion in D2-SPNs, but not D1-SPNs, induces male-specific hyperactivity, whereas cortical hemideletion increases hyperactivity in both sexes. Thus, a locus linked to NDDs acts in distinct striatal circuits, selectively impacting behavior in a sex- and cell type-specific manner. This study demonstrates that 16p11.2 hemideletion, a genetic deletion linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, affects male and female mice differently, altering specific striatal neuronal circuits and driving sex-specific behavioral changes."

 Depression disorder is a global health crisis, due to its high prevalence. Yet clinical treatments are inadequate. Uncovering the neural correlates of depression remission is a vital step toward developing effective therapies. Using a method termed therapeutic network mapping, we performed secondary analyses on the data of 16 longitudinal experiments and found that the network of the amygdala was commonly modulated by three antidepressant therapies (pharmacotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy, and magnetic seizure therapy). This therapeutic network was i) validated by two independent treatment datasets of patients with depression and a prospective preclinical experiment on male rats, ii) associated with networks of depression-related genes, neurotransmitters, and cognitions, and iii) also the target network of deep brain stimulation and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Finally, a longitudinal rTMS experiment indicated that strengthened therapeutic network connectivity is associated with higher depressant alleviation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that distinct antidepressant therapies act on a common network with potential targets for developing effective therapies.

 Antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) has an optimal bandgap and absorption coefficient for thin film solar cell applications and comprises earth abundant elements. The rate of increase in reported power conversion efficiencies has slowed due to a persistently large open circuit voltage deficit attributed to detrimental concentrations of point defects. Here we use depth-profiling positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy to study Sb2Se3 crystals and thin films. The method is specific to neutral and negative charge states of vacancy-related defects. Both monovacancy and divacancy defects are identified in intrinsic and n-type samples but no monovacancy defects are detected in the p-type sample. Comparison of the experimental positron lifetimes with density functional theory calculated values provide evidence for the observation of Sb monovacancies in the –3 state and of Se monovacancies in the –2 state. The results are consistent with recent density function theory predictions that the Sb and the Se monovacancy defects both have accessible negative charge states.

Here, authors show a nose-to-brain axis whereby such odors activate olfactory-piriform circuits that diverge to mediodorsal thalamic nucleus and nucleus accumbens to mediate retching-like behavior and aversion. 
 Rancid odors can trigger retching and aversion in humans that prevent consumption of spoiled food, and consequently metabolic dysregulation, but the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that exposure to 2-methylbutyric acid (2MBA) odor triggers such defensive responses in male mice, mediated by a nose-to-brain axis. 2MBA perception in olfactory epithelium activates neurons in olfactory bulb (OB) projecting to glutamatergic neurons in anterior piriform cortex (aPirGlu), which in turn project to either the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD), which innervates respiratory muscles to drive retching-like behaviors, or project to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) to drive aversion. Artificial inhibition of the nose→OB→aPir→MDGlu→respiratory muscles circuit diminishes retching-like behaviors, but not aversion, while inhibiting the nose→OB→aPir→NAc circuit diminishes aversion, but not retching-like behaviors. These findings thus establish a nose-to-brain axis for rancid odor-triggered retching and aversion in male mice, advancing our understanding of sensory-motor integration and whole-body neural bases of defensive responses to odor. Rancid odors trigger retching and aversion. Here, authors show a nose-to-brain axis whereby such odors activate olfactory-piriform circuits that diverge to mediodorsal thalamic nucleus and nucleus accumbens to mediate retching-like behavior and aversion."

 The flat, stiff sole of energy-storage-and-return prosthetic feet hinders adaptation to irregular terrains. This is among the causes both of high falling risk and of the consequential arising compensatory mechanisms in prosthetic users. To overcome that, we introduce the SoftFoot Pro, an anthropomorphic and adaptive prosthetic foot featuring a flexible and inextensible sole that passively adapts to obstacles, widening the ground contact area. Experimental comparison to a traditional carbon fibre foot in two unilateral transtibial prosthetic users highlights that the adaptive design reduces stance torque and power consumption at the contralateral knee and at both hips, both on level and uneven grounds. The more even load distribution between the two limbs reduces compensatory strategies and gait asymmetries, resulting in biomechanics closer to that of unimpaired individuals. These findings hold promise for enhancing quality of life for individuals with limb loss, potentially improving stability and reducing fall risk.

 The significant challenges pose by the high recurrence and metastasis rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) persist in its diagnosis and treatment. Activating innate immunity in CRC treatment has the potential to reduce drug resistance and side effects. Here, we develop a biomimetic platform by utilizing antimicrobial peptide-functionalized CRC cell membranes to encapsulate a cobalt-based metal-organic framework (C), hereby called peptide-functionalized camouflage C (PfCC). When injected into tumour-bearing mice, PfCC will degrade under the acidic condition of the tumour microenvironment and release cobalt ions, which react with endogenous H2S to generate black stellate precipitates with good photothermal properties, recruiting NK cells and mitigates the immunosuppressive tumour-microenvironment. Simultaneously, the degradation of PfCC will release structure-protected antimicrobial peptides, inhibiting harmful bacteria, such as Desulfovibrio, and reducing H2S production. The abovementioned synergistic top-down regulation of H2S promote the polarization of macrophages and further activates the innate immune response. Moreover, experiments including the convex hull algorithm from AI deep learning of the segment anything model indicate that PfCC exhibites the most effective therapeutic effect compared with the single H2S-regulated therapeutic modality. Taken together, PfCC represents a potential anti-cancer therapy for CRC with the combined effect of immune-regulation and the regulation of the gut flora.

 The projected increase in the sea surface temperature (SST) into the 21st century exhibits a robust southeastern minimum (SEM) pattern in the subtropical Pacific. Despite the agreement between observations and climate models, this pattern remains poorly addressed, with gaps in the proposed mechanisms. Here, we discover a novel air-sea interaction responsible for SEM formation, associated with the changes in the South Pacific subtropical anticyclone (SPSA) and seeded by both the direct CO2 effect and poleward expansion of the tropics. A spatially uniform SST increase leads to anomalous southeasterly winds that can cause cooling in the southern SEM region because of a southwestward shift in the SPSA. With direct CO2 forcing and SST pattern change, an SPSA intensification extends these wind patterns further north to cover the entire SEM. During extension, an anomalous anticyclone is generated by the negative SST anomaly and is vertically inclined southwards by tropospheric warming in the subtropics, due to distinct atmospheric dynamics associated with increasing dry stability. This drives evaporative heat loss over the previously cooled ocean and sustains the SEM SST-wind complex, which is enhanced by cloud feedback. Such an interactive loop is manifested as a single hemisphere wind-evaporation-SST feedback, rather than a cross-equatorial process."

 Carbonyl sulfide (COS) is gaining interest as a proxy for gross primary productivity (GPP). Thinning of the Hyytiälä (Finland) forest in the winter of 2019–2020 altered the response of COS fluxes to environmental conditions in the summer of 2021. For the first time, extended periods of ecosystem-scale COS emissions were observed in a boreal forest. The warm and dry conditions in the summer of 2021 reduced the COS uptake by the canopy and elevated soil abiotic COS production. However, the reduction in canopy uptake and the increase in soil production do not fully explain the observed ecosystem-level emissions. The analysis suggests an unidentified, homogeneously distributed COS source in the eddy covariance footprint area, potentially from the photodegradation of forest floor litter and cutting residue from thinning. Such a source in a boreal forest stand warrants further source apportionment studies to effectively use COS as a proxy for GPP."

 Several locations across Antarctica are experiencing snow algal blooms on the surfaces of coastal snowfields, which significantly reduce surface albedo – by up to 20% – and consequently enhance the melting of snow and ice. Here we revealed the potential distribution of red snow algal blooms in the Antarctic South Shetland Islands between 2018 and 2024. A supervised machine learning approach was applied to 45 cloud-free Sentinel-2 images, using spectral information obtained from a drone-mounted hyperspectral sensor to monitor bloom extent across the entire archipelago. Our results provide clear evidence of the spatial distribution of red snow algae blooms in the South Shetland Islands, which covered up to 12% of the total surface area of a single island during the growth season.

 Existing estimates of carbon sequestration by coastal vegetated ecosystems (e.g., kelp forests, seagrass meadows) remain highly uncertain because they utilize few measurements with high uncertainty or focus on individual stocks or fluxes. Here, we combine empirical data with modeling to generate detailed carbon budgets for kelp forests and eelgrass meadows in Nova Scotia, Canada. Our budgeting showed that the release and export of dissolved organic carbon accounts for substantially more carbon sequestered by these habitats than has been estimated globally (98.5 ± 64.6% for kelp and 84 ± 36.0% for eelgrass), suggesting this carbon pathway has been undervalued. Further, kelp forests are estimated to sequester more carbon than eelgrass by ~1.3 orders of magnitude (27 ± 19% and 12.1 ± 6.3% of annual net primary production for kelp and eelgrass) mainly due to their large habitat area, highlighting their significant but largely overlooked role in ocean carbon sequestration relative to other blue carbon ecosystems.

Leung;Jian Zhen Yu,Source apportionment of fine and coarse particulate matter in Hong Kong and its implications to PM<sub>10</sub> air quality management,"•Fine and coarse PM contributed almost equally to PM10mass in Hong Kong. •Metals linked with PM health effects distributed evenly across fine and coarse PM. •Fine PM mainly from secondary formation/combustion; coarse PM mainly from dust. •Coarse dust transport accounted for 40 % of excess PM10from regional transport. 
 Effective control of ambient respirable particulate matter (PM10, particles with aerodynamic diameters less than 10 μm) is essential for air quality management for public health protection. Achieving this requires targeted strategies that address both fine particles (PM2.5, less than 2.5 μm) and coarse particles (PMcoarse, between 2.5 and 10 μm). In this study, we conducted a two-year field monitoring campaign in an urban residential area in Hong Kong to simultaneously characterize the chemical compositions and sources of PM2.5 and PMcoarse. Nearly half (46 %) of PM10 mass was associated with PMcoarse, with individual species exhibiting distinct distribution patterns across the two size fractions. Transition metals known for their roles in PM oxidative potential (e.g., Mn and Cu) were found to be evenly distributed between fine and coarse modes, underscoring the need for further assessments of their size-resolved health effects. Source apportionment using positive matrix factorization showed that PM2.5 was mainly influenced by secondary sulfate and nitrate formation, road traffic and biomass/coal combustion, whereas PMcoarse was dominated by soil/industrial dust, construction/copper-rich dust and sea salt. Backward air mass trajectory analysis identified a 28 μg/m3 increase in PM10 source contribution under continental air mass influences compared to marine air masses. Coarse-mode soil and industrial dust, primarily transported from inner-continental regions, accounted for 40 % of this excess contribution. This work highlights the growing importance of addressing PMcoarse on a regional scale in future air quality research and control strategies to meet PM10 air quality targets."

 Tropical cyclones (TCs) can significantly influence tropospheric ozone (O3) in coastal regions, with impacts closely tied to TC tracks. Based on long-term observational records, this study examined O3 formation and sources in Nanjing under TCs from July to October over 2014–2023. During this period, the number of O3-polluted days increased from 43 to 80. Notably, between July and October, TCs and O3 pollution episodes frequently coincided, with ∼49 % of O3 pollution occurring on TC days. Applying a finite mixture algorithm, TCs affecting Nanjing were classified into three tracks: northwest track (NT), turning track (TT) and westward track (WT). NT occurred earliest; TT had the fewest TC days; WT was most frequent but developed latest. NT TCs located near (128°E, 21°N), about 800 km from Nanjing with intensities above severe tropical storm, were most frequently associated with O3 pollution, whereas TT and WT corresponded to TCs near (126°E, 24°N) and (111°E, 21°N) with varying intensities. Across all TC tracks, O3 formation and accumulation were favored (46.6 % to 61.6 %) by higher temperature (5.1 % to 20.8 %), lower relative humidity (−25.8 % to −16.6 %), reduced cloud cover (−21.0 % to −14.1 %), lower wind speed (−24.5 % to −7.6 %), and elevated concentrations of NO2 (14.1 % to 15.2 %) and CO (12.3 % to 18.5 %). However, O3 pollution varied with the TC's location. In the early phases, southeastern peripheral airflow transported O3 and its precursors from the Shanghai–northern Zhejiang–Nanjing corridor, contributing over 50 % of the total. As TCs moved, NT TCs facilitated short-range transport from central Anhui (∼23.4 %), TT TCs enhanced northward transport from Shandong and Jiangsu (∼54.0 %), and WT TCs drove long-range transport from Jiangxi and even Guangzhou (∼19.6 %). These findings suggest that the movement and positioning of TCs can significantly influence O3 pollutions, providing valuable insights for O3 pollution control in coastal cities."
