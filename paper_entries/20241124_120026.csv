10.1088/1748-9326/ad9294,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究的是气溶胶对华东地区极端小时降水的影响。研究使用区域气候模式(RCM) COSMO进行公里级分辨率的模拟，评估了硫酸盐和黑炭气溶胶的直接和半直接辐射效应。结果表明，硫酸盐气溶胶的变化会影响极端小时降水的强度，而黑炭气溶胶的影响则更为复杂，可能与地理位置有关。该研究主要关注的是气溶胶的辐射强迫如何改变大气稳定性，进而影响降水的极端性，并没有直接使用大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等。因此，它与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强。,"['Aerosols', 'Sulfate aerosols', 'Black carbon aerosols', 'Precipitation', 'Regional climate model', 'Convection-permitting simulations']",Shuping Li;Tao Su;Ruolan Xiang;Christoph Schär,Direct and semi-direct aerosol effects on the scaling of extreme sub-daily precipitation over East China,"Aerosols can alter atmospheric stability through radiative forcing, thereby changing mean and daily extreme precipitation on regional scales. However, it is unclear how extreme sub-daily precipitation responds to aerosol radiative effects. In this study, we use the regional climate model (RCM) Consortium for Small-scale Modeling (COSMO) to perform convection-permitting climate simulations at a kilometer-scale (0.04°/~4.4 km) resolution for the period 2001–2010. By evaluating against the observed hourly precipitation-gauge data, the COSMO model with explicit deep convection can effectively reproduce sub-daily and daily extreme precipitation events, as well as diurnal cycles of summer mean precipitation and wet hour frequency. Moreover, aerosol sensitivity simulations are conducted with sulfate and black carbon aerosol perturbations to assess the direct and semi-direct aerosol effects on extreme sub-daily precipitation in the COSMO model. The destabilizing effects associated with decreased sulfate aerosols intensify extreme sub-daily precipitation, while increased sulfate aerosols tend to induce an opposite change. In contrast, the response of extreme sub-daily precipitation to black carbon aerosol perturbations exhibits a nonlinear behavior and potentially relies on geographical location. Overall, the scaling rates of extreme precipitation intensities decrease and approach the Clausius–Clapeyron rate from hourly to daily time scales, and the responses to sulfate and black carbon aerosols vary with precipitation durations. This study improves the understanding of aerosol radiative effects on sub-daily extreme precipitation events in RCMs."

In this study, we proposed an innovative approach to probe site heterogeneities on the goethite surface by comparing the adsorption behavior of rare earth elements (REEs, including Sc, Y, and all lanthanides; Ln) except Pm, as well as Th and U. A surface loading-dependent adsorption of Ln and Y was observed, with a shift from (i) preferential middle to heavy REE adsorption and (ii) limited to substantial fractionation between Y and Ho as the loading increased. These observations are likely attributable to the formation of strong and weak complexes onto the (021) and (110)/(100) goethite faces at low and high loadings, respectively. Additionally, Ce-anomaly, characteristic of Ce(III) partial oxidation to Ce(IV), was observed only at high loading. By drawing an analogy with Th(IV) and Sc(III), Ce(IV) is expected to outcompete Ln(III) and Y adsorptions and stabilize primarily at the strong sites on the (021) face, even under conditions of high loading. The outcome of this study, supported by charge distribution-multisite complexation (CD-MUSIC) calculation, provides new insights into the impact of facet-dependent adsorption and redox processes on Fe-oxyhydroxides."

Urban,Incorporating Ecosystem Services into Solar Energy Siting to Enhance Sustainable Energy Transitions,"Solar energy is expected to play a large role in decarbonization of the energy sector globally. In the United States, solar energy is forecasted to generate roughly 45% of the electricity by 2050. Although solar energy mitigates the negative effects of climate change by providing electricity without releasing greenhouse gases, little is known about the implications of solar energy development for ecosystem services. In this study, we developed a spatially explicit, techno-ecological solar suitability model consisting of six scenarios designed to evaluate the trade-offs between ground-mounted solar energy generation and multiple ecosystem services. By incorporating solar suitability modeling with ecosystem service evaluation, we develop a method that provides a comprehensive understanding of potential techno-ecological trade-offs. To test our methodology, we used Connecticut (USA) as a study site for analyzing the potential trade-offs of future solar energy facilities, but the methods can be widely applied. Our results suggest that well-sited solar energy development can decrease sediment and nutrient export while offsetting carbon emissions from power plants. This study provides a holistic assessment of incorporating ecosystem services in future solar energy development decision-making and presents an approach for minimizing trade-offs and maximizing sustainable outcomes."

However, the specific role of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in the pathogenesis of GDM remains controversial. This prospective cohort study sought to investigate how coexposure to bisphenols, parabens, triclosan (TCS), benzophenone-type UV filters, and neonicotinoids (NEOs) affects the odds of GDM. Quantile-based g-computation and Bayesian kernel machine regression showed a significant inverse relationship between EDC mixtures and the reduced risk of GDM (OR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.13–0.87), which was mainly explained by bisphenol (OR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.29–0.80) and paraben (OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.40–0.91) exposure. Bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol Z (BPZ), ethylparaben (EtP), propylparaben (PrP), and butylparaben (BuP) were identified as key contributors to the joint effect. In addition, subgroup analyses suggested that the bisphenols-GDM association was more pronounced in younger/normal-weight participants. The sex-specific impact of exposure to bisphenols on the development of GDM was observed, whereas the second trimester represented a critical window for EDC exposure. Continued research efforts, focusing on causal pathways and nonmonotonic relationships, will be crucial to elucidate the complex influence of EDC exposure on the development of GDM."

We developed a subduction model that self‐consistently integrates buoyancy forces, diffusion and dislocation creep, and inter‐plate friction. From the nonlinear dynamics emerge long‐term plate motions that achieve velocities of ≈5 ${\approx} 5$ cm/year, effective viscosities of ≈1019 ${\approx} 1{0}^{19}$ Pa⋅ $\cdot $s below plates, and sudden slips up to ≈10 ${\approx} 10$ m repeating every several hundred years.

Computations with L∼∼103 $\tilde{L}\sim 1{0}^{3}$ km generate events with Mw≈9 ${M}_{w}\approx 9$. When L∼ $\tilde{L}$ decreases, there is a commensurate decrease in the effective moment of rupture events.

Here we reported evidence for a double‐peak superposition at the EIA crest of each hemisphere, forming a four‐peak structure, with the additional peaks located ∼10° poleward of normal crests, as observed by CSES at 500 km altitudes on dayside, during the 23 April 2023 geomagnetic storm. Such a unique structure occurred when the eastward prompt penetration electric field (PPEF) was developed. Interestingly, distinctive large‐scale traveling ionospheric disturbances derived from GNSS‐TEC data propagated equatorward but not coincidently interacted with the EIA poleward peaks. The short‐duration intense PPEF may be the most plausible mechanism, which could cause the “fountain” plasma highly elevated into the topside which gradually fell into CSES altitudes on poleward sides of regular EIA crests, causing the superposition of crest in addition to nominal crest generated by the regular wind dynamo."

We use satellite remote sensing and reanalysis data to characterize changes in Hektoria, a former Larsen B Ice Shelf tributary, over the last ∼20 years and document a period of retreat from 2002 to 2011, and readvancement from 2011 to 2022.

Forecasts of root growth and carbon sequestration under global change are compromised by uncertainty in how plants will allocate biomass between above and belowground pools. Here, we develop a simple model to assess whether functional balance theory can explain a complex biomass allocation response observed in a brackish marsh under experimental warming and elevated CO2. Our model shows how treatment‐driven changes in nitrogen supply and demand can explain divergent observations of root growth (i.e., maximum responses under intermediate warming and elevated CO2). The model also reveals a surprising interaction between warming and eutrophication, where enhanced N loading to coastal marshes may reduce adverse impacts of warming on root growth. Our findings provide a mechanistic basis for incorporating biomass allocation into forecast models of marsh evolution. They also provide a general example of using ecological theory to decompose complex net responses observed in multi‐factor global change experiments into constituent processes."

However, these data sets usually contain substantial conditional biases with respect to extreme precipitation (EP) events—undermining their utility for extreme event analysis. Nevertheless, the main source of such EP biases remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that WA algorithms are responsible for less than 1% of total EP biases. Instead, EP biases originate from the multi‐source precipitation inputs, which are not adequately adjusted prior to WA. Specifically, current data‐merging frameworks only correct the monthly means or statistical distributions of the remote sensing/reanalysis precipitation inputs prior to WA. Such procedures are insufficient for adjusting EP timing uncertainties, which eventually propagate into the WA‐based merged data set as an EP bias. Therefore, developing algorithms that iteratively adjust EP timing and intensity errors should be prioritized in future precipitation merging frameworks."

While GHG response is characterized by its first leading mode, AER response consists of two distinct modes. The first one, featuring long‐term global AER increase and global cooling, opposes GHG response patterns up to the mid‐twentieth century. The second one, featuring multidecadal variations in AER distributions and interhemispheric asymmetric surface ocean changes, appears to reinforce the GHG warming effect over recent decades.

We also analyze the electron density behavior across different magnetic topologies as a function of PSW⊥/PCMF ${P}_{\text{SW}\perp }/{P}_{\text{CMF}}$. The extremely low electron density in the draped topology relates to ionopause‐like structures. The lower electron density in the closed and open topology under higher PSW⊥/PCMF ${P}_{\text{SW}\perp }/{P}_{\text{CMF}}$ may be attributed to a downward force, potentially the J × B force in the case of closed topology.

However, some regions of low HDI with a large population experienced slow acceleration due to high local aerosol emissions. Since aerosol negative forcing impacts are short‐lived and localized, rapid future reduction of aerosol emissions without a concurrent reduction in GHG emissions could have major compounding impacts.

In homogeneous rock, waterfalls often retreat either by direct waterfall‐face erosion or incision from repeating (‘cyclic’) steps formed above waterfalls. We lack knowledge on the conditions driving these different erosion styles, limiting our ability to predict waterfall retreat. We address this knowledge gap through flume experiments assessing how changing flow hydraulics modulates bedrock erosion. We show that, under large discharges, changes in flow hydraulics cause spatial variability in particle impact velocity, leading to cyclic step formation. As discharge decreases, both the magnitude and spatial variability of particle impact velocity decreases, causing more uniform erosion, limiting cyclic step development and potentially allowing direct erosion of the waterfall face to become the dominant retreat mechanism. These results suggest climate change and water‐resource management can alter the rate and style of waterfall retreat."

However, contributions of aerosol‐PBL interactions to future air quality benefits remain unclear. Here we conduct ensemble experiments using the variable‐resolution (VR) Community Atmosphere Model with full chemistry based on the scalable spectral element (SE) dynamical core with East Asia refined to ∼28 km (SE_VR). Additional simulations at a uniform resolution of ∼111 km (SE_UR) are conducted to help demonstrate SE_VR's advantages in projecting future air quality. Results of SE_VR show that the mean PM2.5 concentrations in China would drop to below 10 μg/m3, especially in Sichuan Basin (SCB) where the frequencies of moderate and severe air pollution events are predicted to decrease from 60.7% and 11.3% to nearly zero respectively when achieving carbon neutrality. The aerosol‐PBL interactions would be substantially weakened with anthropogenic emission reductions. At SCB and Eastern China (EC), the weakened radiative effects of black carbon (BC) would contribute 34.3% and 71.6% to the increase in PBL height (PBLH). Consequently, these weakened BC‐PBL interactions reduce the surface PM2.5 concentrations by 16.1 μg/m3 (18.9%) in SCB and 4.6 μg/m3 (16.4%) in EC. Notably, SE_VR outperforms SE_UR in projecting the frequency decrease of future air pollution events for its better reproducing current levels, particularly those caused by BC aerosols. This study highlights the importance of weakened aerosol‐PBL feedbacks on future air quality improvement and demonstrates the added values of variable‐resolution global models in air quality projections."

McKenna Neuman;G. Saarenvirta;P. O’Brien,Dust Generation From Aggregate Comminution During Transport in a Laboratory Wind Tunnel,"Particle aggregates blown along the surface of playas have been linked to the disruption of interparticle bonds, comminution, and dust production. This mechanism was investigated in a set of wind tunnel experiments with the purpose of examining the rate of comminution during transport, role of bed roughness, influence of humidity, system dynamics, and proportionate amount of dust production. The playa sediment selected for testing was obtained from Owens Lake in California, USA. Particle aggregates with diameters between 500 and 710 μm (0.5 ϕ–1.0 ϕ) were isolated by sieving. Small 20 g subsamples were then introduced into the wind tunnel via a drop tube, with some particles captured on a downwind array of sticky glass plates. Aggregate diameter was found to decrease linearly by 30–56 μm per meter of transport (r2 = 0.43) over a total distance of 8.3 m. Enhanced geometric roughness of the bed surface increased this rate, but not dust production and suspension. As compared to an equivalent mass of disaggregated parent material representing the dust emission potential, comminution produced only 0.5%–4% as much suspended PM10. Weak longitudinal flow instabilities involving downwelling and upwelling were found to influence the vertically integrated mass transport rate. This affirms the high sensitivity of dust transport to the structure of the wind field and the need for a paradigm shift in wind tunnel simulations of dust emission to extend measurement of the factors governing dispersion beyond one dimension, and specifically, friction velocity."

We build and train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict the occurrence of cloud‐to‐ground (CG) lightning across the WUS during June–September from the spatial patterns of seven large‐scale meteorological variables from reanalysis (1995–2022). Individually trained CNN models at each 1° × 1° grid cell (n = 285 CNNs) show high skill at predicting CG lightning days across the WUS (median AUC = 0.8) and perform best in parts of the interior Southwest where summertime CG lightning is most common. Further, interannual correlation between observed and predicted CG lightning days is high (median r = 0.87), demonstrating that locally trained CNNs realistically capture year‐to‐year variation in CG lightning activity across the WUS. We then use layer‐wise relevance propagation (LRP) to investigate the relevance of predictor variables to successful CG lightning prediction in each grid cell. Using maximum LRP values, our results show that two thermodynamic variables—ratio of surface moist static energy to free‐tropospheric saturation moist static energy, and the 700–500 hPa lapse rate—are the most relevant CG lightning predictors for 93%–96% of CNNs depending on the LRP variant used. As lightning is not directly simulated by global climate models, these CNNs could be used to parameterize CG lightning in climate models to assess changes in future CG lightning occurrence with projected climate change.

This proxy‐based altered relationship between insolation and East Asian precipitation is also obvious in an accelerated transient Holocene experiment. The simulation indicates that the East Asian summer monsoon strength directly responds to the insolation change, failing to explain the varying insolation‐precipitation relationship. However, the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) can modulate the moisture transport over East Asia, playing a crucial role in shaping the precipitation response to insolation. During the Holocene, the position and intensity of WPSH are determined not only by changes in insolation but also by changes in its meridional gradient, which could explain the shift in the insolation‐precipitation relationship around the middle Holocene. This conclusion provides a possible mechanism for the asynchronous Holocene optimum of East Asian precipitation."

In the future, rivers may export more pollutants to coastal waters, driven by socio‐economic development, increased material consumption, and climate change. However, existing scenarios often ignore multi‐pollutant problems. Here, we aim to explore future trends in annual river exports of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), plastics (macro and micro), and emerging contaminants (triclosan and diclofenac) at the sub‐basin scale worldwide. For this, we implement into the process‐based MARINA‐Multi model (Model to Assess River Inputs of pollutaNts to the seAs) two new multi‐pollutant scenarios: “Sustainability‐driven Future” (SD) and “Economy‐driven Future” (ED). In ED, river exports of nutrients and microplastics will double by 2100, globally. In SD, a decrease of up to 83% is projected for river export of all studied pollutants by 2100, globally. Diffuse sources such as fertilizers are largely responsible for increasing nutrient pollution in the two scenarios. Point sources, namely sewage systems, are largely responsible for increasing microplastic pollution in the ED scenario. In both scenarios, the coastal waters of the Indian Ocean will receive up to 400% more pollutants from rivers by 2100 because of growing population, urbanization, and poor waste management in the African and Asian sub‐basins. The situation differs for sub‐basins draining into the Mediterranean Sea and the Pacific Ocean (mainly less future pollution) and the Atlantic Ocean and Arctic Ocean (more or less future pollution depending on sub‐basins and scenarios). From 56% to 78% of the global population are expected to live in more polluted river basins in the future, challenging sustainable development goals for clean waters."

 ARL5 is a member of the ARF family of small GTPases that is recruited to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) by another ARF-family member, ARFRP1, in complex with the transmembrane protein SYS1. ARL5 recruits its effector, the multisubunit tethering complex GARP, to promote SNARE-dependent fusion of endosome-derived retrograde transport carriers with the TGN. To further investigate the function of ARL5, we sought to identify additional effectors. Using proximity biotinylation and protein interaction assays, we found that the armadillo-repeat protein ARMH3 (C10orf76) binds to active, but not inactive, ARL5, and that it is recruited to the TGN in a SYS1-ARFRP1-ARL5-dependent manner. Unlike GARP, ARMH3 is not required for the retrograde transport of various cargo proteins. Instead, ARMH3 functions to activate phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIβ (PI4KB), accounting for the main pool of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) at the TGN. This function contributes to recruitment of the oncoprotein GOLPH3 and glycan modifications at the TGN.

 Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in December 2019, prompting the implementation of a “zero-COVID” policy in Mainland China. The easing of this policy in December 2022 led to a surge in COVID cases, which was believed to significantly increase antibiotic usage, potentially due to antibiotic misuse or increased coinfections. Our study aimed to compare antibiotic consumption and patterns before and after this policy adjustment. We utilised wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to analyse antibiotic levels in samples collected from five wastewater treatment plants in Eastern China during January and February of 2021 and 2023. 27 antibiotics were quantified using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and analysed via WBE, with the resulting estimates compared with catchment-specific prescription data. 23 antibiotics were detected in wastewater samples, with a substantial increase in usage in 2023 (ranging from 531% to 3734%), consistent with prescription data. Here, we show a significant rise in antibiotic consumption during the COVID-19 surge and this underscores the need for further investigation into the impacts of inappropriate antibiotic use in China.

 Attosecond science has demonstrated that electrons can be controlled on the sub-cycle time scale of an optical waveform, paving the way towards optical frequency electronics. However, these experiments historically relied on high-energy laser pulses and detection not suitable for microelectronic integration. For practical optical frequency electronics, a system suitable for integration and capable of generating detectable signals with low pulse energies is needed. While current from plasmonic nanoantenna emitters can be driven at optical frequencies, low charge yields have been a significant limitation. In this work we demonstrate that large-scale electrically connected plasmonic nanoantenna networks, when driven in concert, enable charge yields sufficient for single-shot carrier-envelope phase detection at repetition rates exceeding tens of kilohertz. We not only show that limitations in single-shot CEP detection techniques can be overcome, but also demonstrate a flexible approach to optical frequency electronics in general, enabling future applications such as high sensitivity petahertz-bandwidth electric field sampling or logic-circuits.

 Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is the predominant pathway that repairs DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) in vertebrates. However, due to challenges in detecting DSBs in living cells, the repair capacity of the NHEJ pathway is unknown. The DNA termini of many DSBs must be processed to allow ligation while minimizing genetic changes that result from break repair. Emerging models propose that DNA termini are first synapsed ~115 Å apart in one of several long-range synaptic complexes before transitioning into a short-range synaptic complex that juxtaposes DNA ends to facilitate ligation. The transition from long-range to short-range synaptic complexes involves both conformational and compositional changes of the NHEJ factors bound to the DNA break. Importantly, it is unclear how NHEJ proceeds in vivo because of the challenges involved in analyzing recruitment of NHEJ factors to DSBs over time in living cells. Here, we develop an approach to study the temporal and compositional dynamics of NHEJ complexes using live cell single-molecule imaging. Our results provide direct evidence for stepwise maturation of the NHEJ complex, pinpoint key regulatory steps in NHEJ progression, and allowed us to estimate the overall repair capacity of the NHEJ pathway in living cells.

 Photocatalytic N-to-C aryl migration allows for quick construction of highly useful amide derivatives from readily available compounds. By developing the reactions of sodium sulfinates with the N-aryl-propiolamides, we herein demonstrate that the CO2-promoted visible-light-induced method enables a large variety of aryl groups on nitrogen atoms of the N-arylamides to undergo efficient aryl migration from N atom to C atom to synthesize tetra- and tri-substituted alkenyl amides selectively. 1,4-N-to-C aryl migration is a key step in this transformation which is achieved through photocatalytic radical-polar crossover pathway. The protocol exhibits the remarkably tolerant of the electronic properties of the migrating aryl substituent, as both electron-rich and -poor arenes are compatible with the migration process. As a result, this protocol features with a broad substrate scope, as demonstrated by more than 90 examples including complex bioactive compounds. Notably, abundant, nontoxic and low-cost CO2 acted as an essential and irreplaceable additive to enable the tetra- and tri-substituted alkenyl amides to be synthesized with excellent selectivity.

 Climate change and diabetes pose the dual challenges to human health, yet there is a lack of evidence regarding future health burden of diabetes attributable to climate change. In this study, we used three-stage analytic strategy to project the heat-related and heatwave-related diabetes deaths by demographic characteristics and regions, during 2010–2100 in 32 major Chinese cities. Under SSP5-8.5 (high carbon emission scenario), heat-related attributable fraction of diabetes mortality is projected to rise from 2.3% (95% empirical confidence interval [eCI]: 1.1%, 3.6%) in the 2010s to 19.2% (95% eCI: 10.2%, 32.5%) in the 2090s, and estimated heatwave-related attributable fractions will increase from 0.8% (95% eCI: 0.6%, 1.0%) in the 2010s to 9.3% (95% eCI: 6.7%, 11.8%) in the 2090s. We projected that the number of heat- and heatwave-related diabetes deaths would increase from 1525 (95% eCI: 759, 2431) and 529 (95% eCI: 382, 668) in the 2010s, to 12,956 (95% eCI: 6861, 21,937) and 6312 (95% eCI: 4557, 7972) in the 2090s, respectively.

 Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are narrow corridors of intense water vapor transport, shaping precipitation, floods, and economies. Temporal clustering of ARs tripled losses compared to isolated events, yet the reasons behind this clustering remain unclear. AR orientation further modulates hydrological impacts through terrain interaction. Here we identify unique ARs over the North Pacific and Western U.S. and utilize Cox regression and composite analysis to examine how six major climate modes influence temporal clustering of unique ARs and orientation during extended boreal winter (November to March). Results show that climate modes condition temporal clustering of unique ARs.

The quasi-biennial oscillation and Pacific decadal oscillation affect late winter clustering, while the Arctic oscillation dominates early winter.

 Global environmental change may lead to changes in community structure and in species interactions, ultimately changing ecosystem functioning. Focusing on spatial variation in fungus–plant interactions across the rapidly changing Arctic, we quantified variation in the identity of interaction partners. We then related interaction turnover to variation in the bioclimatic environment by combining network analyses with general dissimilarity modelling. Overall, we found species associations to be highly plastic, with major rewiring among interaction partners across variable environmental conditions. Of this turnover, a major part was attributed to specific environmental properties which are likely to change with progressing climate change. Our findings suggest that the current structure of plant-root associated interactions may be severely altered by rapidly advancing global warming.

 The product of near-infrared reflectance of vegetation and photosynthetic active radiation (NIRvP) is a new tool for monitoring gross primary productivity (GPP) dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems, due to the discovered linear correlation between NIRvP and GPP. While remote sensing-based NIRvP is considerably influenced by sensor geometry, such geometry impacts on the NIRvP-GPP relationship remain underexplored. In this study, we calculate NIRvP using observations from the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) that provide unique hotspot observation geometry in which the sensor viewing angle coincides with the sun direction. We evaluated the linear correlation between NIRvP and GPP in both the common nadir direction and the special hotspot direction. The results indicate that NIRvP in the hotspot direction significantly outperforms that in the nadir direction for tracking GPP variations across different ecosystems from diurnal to daily scales. This conclusion is further supported by data from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and simulations using the Soil Canopy Observation Photosynthesis Energy (SCOPE) model.

 SummaryManagement of forest genetics is shifting from a paradigm focused on increasing timber volume to a prioritization of climate adaptation. Functional traits related to foliar structure, photosynthetic and photoprotective pigments, and stress underlie climate adaptation and have spectral signatures that can be quantified with remote sensing. Common-garden trials present an opportunity to assess the genetic basis of multispectral reflectance dynamics across genotypes. We analyzed multitemporal drone remote sensing of 1350 individual trees from 88 populations from diverse geographic and climatic provenances in a provenance trial of interior spruce (Picea engelmannii, P. glauca, and their hybrids) to assess patterns of genetic differentiation, local adaptation to climate, and hybridization from multispectral reflectance. We quantified early-summer, mid-summer, late-summer, and late-winter multispectral vegetation indices for each population and derived variables describing changes in these indices during winter-to-summer photosynthetic green-up and early-to-late-summer decline. Spectral traits revealed moderate population differentiation (Vpop = 14.4 % — 39.9 %) and significant (P < .005) patterns of local adaptation to provenance warmest-month temperature and elevation. Derived green-up and decline indices revealed additional relationships for coldest-month temperature, date of first frost, precipitation-as-snow, and climatic moisture deficit. Principal components described leaf area greenness, the magnitude of green-up, and seasonal decline in the red edge. Hierarchical clustering of these principal components identified eight geographically and climatically distinct clusters which captured major patterns in hybridization. Seasonal dynamics of vegetation indices, assessed with multitemporal drone remote sensing, can identify important patterns in hybridization and adaptation to climate which are not evident from spectral reflectance assessed at one time of year. These dynamic spectral traits have the potential to quantify the functional basis of local adaptation in common-garden trials and facilitate the selection of resilient genotypes for future climates."

 Litter on the forest floor, or from a fire perspective the litter fuel load (LFL), is a key driver of the occurrence and spread of surface fires and an important regulator of forest fire behavior. High-quality spatiotemporal LFL data are essential for modeling fire behavior and assessing fire risk in forest ecosystems. Traditionally, LFL is estimated from ground-based measurements, but they are difficult to implement on large spatial scales. While remote sensing techniques have the advantage of large-scale observation, they encounter challenges in retrieving LFL because forest canopies generally block signals from the forest floor. Here we present a new method based on modeled litter accumulation to estimate LFL dynamics, integrating litterfall influx from the forest canopy and decomposition outflux through a mass balance approach. Annual litterfall was estimated based on seasonal changes in foliage fuel load which are retrieved from Landsat imagery and a radiative transfer model, while the decomposition rate was derived from meteorological data. Litterfall and decomposition were quantified over the past 20 years with the difference between the two being LFL accumulating over time. We validated the estimated LFL using 105 ground-based measurements in Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, China, and this validation demonstrated a reasonably strong performance for estimating LFL (R2 = 0.67, root mean squared error (RMSE) = 2.56 Mg ha−1, relative RMSE = 31.61 %).

 Interpreting surface geological elements (such as rocks, minerals, soils, and water bodies) is the main task of geological survey, which plays a crucial role in geological environment remote sensing (GERS). However, the characteristics of geological elements, including high variabilities, various morphology, complicated boundaries and imbalanced class distribution, make it still a challenge for deep learning methods to interpret GERS images. Considering the correlations of geological elements as the regionalized variables in geostatistics, the sensitive features of GERS interpretation mainly include three aspects: tonal, textural and structural characteristics within a singular-class elements, spatial and spectral correlations of adjacent elements, and their global tectonic or spatial distribution. Thus, to simulate the manual interpretation process of geologists from local to global and promote GERS interpretation performance, we propose a local-to-global multi-scale feature fusion network (LGMSFNet). A geological object context represents the intra-class semantic dependencies of pixel sets with the same class. And a local feature aggregation module models the channel and spatial association. Then discriminative features are integrated by a global feature fusion module. For the model optimization, we focus on hard examples during the training process to achieve the balanced optimization of various categories. Two research areas that include large-scale rocks, soils and water exposed on the surface are selected. Massive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the LGMSFNet in GERS interpretation."

 Snow cover significantly influences the Earth’s climate system and global hydrological cycle through its thermal insulation properties and high albedo, and is an important component of the cryosphere. Currently, the most efficient means of quantifying snow depth at both global and regional scales is through passive microwave remote sensing. However, the accuracy of passive microwave remote sensing inversion of snow depth in forested areas is affected by the forest canopy. In this study, a normalized maximum stem volume (NMSV) index was constructed by combining canopy height and tree cover data obtained through remote sensing techniques. The NMSV index was then incorporated into development of snow depth retrieval algorithm to improve accuracy of passive microwave snow depth estimation in forested areas. Compared to the Chang algorithm and the AMSR-E snow depth product, this study demonstrated higher accuracy in the mid- to high-latitude forested areas of Eurasia, with an R value approximately twice as high and a reduction in the overall root mean square error (RMSE) by 2.3 cm and 7.2 cm, respectively. The relative mean bias of this study in the Western Russia, the Eastern Siberian Mountains and the Northeast China is significantly reduced than that of the existing remote sensing algorithms. Against the ERA5 and GlobSnow datasets, with the exception of the Western Russia, the performance of this study in the mid- to high-latitude forested areas of Eurasia is comparable to the ERA5 dataset and superior to the other datasets. Based on the performance of the algorithms in different NMSV values, we observe a decline in the accuracy of this algorithm when the value exceeds 0.8, which was caused by small size of high NMSV values among the ground observation sites involved in the development of snow depth retrieval algorithm. Overall, the NMSV index proposed in this study, which integrates information from both the horizontal and vertical structures of forest, can better characterize the microwave radiation properties of sparse and moderately dense forests, facilitating improvements in the accuracy of passive microwave snow depth retrieval in global forested areas."

 In recent years, extreme climate has increasingly triggered record boreal wildfires. The year 2023 saw a significant surge in wildfire occurrences in Canada, far surpassing the historical record. In this study, multi-source data were utilized for a comprehensive analysis of the development of the Canadian wildfires in 2023, the pathways of wildfire smoke, and its impact on the air quality in the US. The results indicate that the 2023 Canadian wildfires mainly occurred in western Canada (accounting for 60% of the burned area) and Quebec (eastern Canada, 29% of the burned area). Weather systems played a key role throughout wildfires and smoke plume transport processes. Specifically, high temperatures and dry weather caused by the blocking high-pressure systems was conducive to the enhancement of wildfire activities. Additionally, the southward airflow ahead of the ridge facilitated the transport of wildfires plume towards the south. This transport pattern frequently manifests under the Weather Regimes (WR) associated with the Alaskan Ridge (AkR) and Arctic High (ArH). In May and July, the smoke originating from the wildfires in western Canada, guided by the North American trough, affected the midwestern US. In June, smoke from eastern Canada led to severe air pollution in the northeastern US. Throughout the wildfire season, particulate matter dominated pollution in the US.

While the average NO3− concentration was 27.7 μg m−3, four times the whole campaign's average, EP3 was highlighted by a high morning NO2/NOx ratio and significantly elevated daytime and nighttime Ox (O3+NO2) concentrations compared to non-episode days. Throughout the entire campaign, NOz surrogate (NO2(CL)-NO2(T)), Ox, and Fmoderate + thick (the combined number fractions of moderately and thickly coated-rBC particles) tended to increase with the PM2.5 concentration. During the daytime, as PM2.5 increased, Fmoderate + thick showed a monotonic increase, accompanied by RH rising from 54 ± 16% to 63 ± 11%. In contrast, at nighttime of humid condition with RH often exceeding 70% the enhancement of Fmoderate + thick was more sensitive to condensable gas levels than RH. Given that high levels of PM2.5 (>60 μg m−3) were observed only during EP3, enhanced levels of NOz surrogate, Ox, Fmoderate + thick, and RH were evident characteristics of EP3. Such chemical and meteorological conditions suggest that the chemically enhanced oxidation state was evident during EP3, which promoted the formation of secondary aerosols on primary particles including rBC, especially under conditions of elevated RH. Considering the recent trend of increasing number of vehicles and rising atmospheric O3 concentrations in East Asia, future studies should be well designed to investigate the detailed mechanisms involved in heterogeneous reactions that lead to the formation of secondary aerosols."

 The remnant inland circulation of Typhoon Doksuri induced catastrophic heavy precipitation in July 2023 in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area of China. The role of climate trends in this event is investigated using the pseudo-global warming approach. The control experiment driven by the ERA5 reanalysis captures the intensity and spatial distribution of the heavy precipitation reasonably well. The effects of climate trends are investigated by removing climate trends in various variables from the boundary and initial conditions of the sensitivity experiments. The warming trend of sea surface temperature is found to enhance extreme precipitation intensity, while the specific humidity trend, which is positive over the ocean but negative in some inland regions, has negligible impacts on inland extreme precipitation. The impacts of atmospheric dynamic trends are found to be predominant, which alter the track of the remnant circulation, reduce precipitation intensity, and substantially change the spatial distribution of precipitation. This study highlights the importance of considering atmospheric dynamic trends when assessing the impacts of climate trends on typhoon remnant circulations over land, which may lead to extreme precipitation in regions that have rarely experienced such extremes before."

 Summer precipitation over the Maritime Continent (MC) is tightly connected to livelihoods of the locals, and the corresponding strong convective activities are also crucial to Asian regional climate variations remotely. Using observational and reanalysis data from 1958 to 2020, we found that El Niño with different decay rates can cause different summer precipitation anomalies in the MC area. In the fast decaying (FD) El Niño summer, the MC area shows a precipitation surplus, while the MC precipitation decreases during the slow decaying (SD) El Niño summer. For the FD El Niño, the equatorial central-eastern Pacific warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly quickly turns into cold in the decaying summer, while the SST over MC region sustains a warm anomaly owing to the Indo-western Pacific Ocean capacitor effect. This local warm SST anomaly leads to anomalous ascent and then excessive precipitation, further stimulating low-level easterly wind to east of the MC with increased water vapor transport. For the SD El Niño, the central-eastern Pacific warm SST anomaly sustains till the decaying summer, continuously adjusting the Walker circulation. An anomalous local descent motion associated with the weakened Walker circulation region hampers the MC precipitation in summer. Our findings benefit the local researches of the MC summer climate variations, and potentially favor the regional climate predictions."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2024.107781,True,Atmospheric Research,这篇论文研究了1948-2010年期间东北亚地区的干旱趋势，重点关注人为因素的影响。研究发现，人为因素显著加速了该地区的干旱趋势，其中蒸散发（evapotranspiration）的增加贡献最大，约占干旱趋势的64%。人为造成的增温导致潜在蒸散发量(PET)增加是造成这一现象的主要原因。研究使用了“动态调整”方法，结合观测数据，定量评估了人为因素对干旱趋势的影响，结果表明人为因素导致干旱趋势区域扩大约21%，并且加剧了干旱趋势的强度。 这项研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为对蒸散发、降水和潜在蒸散发等数据的获取和分析，很可能依赖于卫星观测和遥感技术，例如气象卫星上的传感器可以用来观测地表温度、湿度和降水等数据，从而计算蒸散发和潜在蒸散发。因此，这项研究成果可以为利用遥感技术监测和预测干旱提供科学依据。,"['Evapotranspiration', 'Precipitation', 'Potential evapotranspiration (PET)', 'Drying trends', 'Anthropogenic forcing', 'Satellite observations', 'Climate change', 'Remote sensing', 'Atmospheric water vapor']",Ruixia Guo;Jianping Huang;Haipeng Yu;Zeyong Hu,Accelerated drying trends over Northeast Asia by anthropogenic forcing during 1948–2010,"•Northeast Asia has experienced significant drying trends during 1948–2010. •Anthropogenic forcing has significantly accelerated the drying trends. •Anthropogenic warming induced PET increase made a major contribution. 
 Northeast Asia has experienced a significant drying trend since the 1950s. Attribution of this drying trend is important for understanding drying and its response to anthropogenic forcing. Despite increasing evidence of human influence on surface air temperature and precipitation, how human-induced climate change is affecting the observed aridity change is poorly understood. Here, by employing a “dynamical adjustment” methodology, we present an alternative estimation of the anthropogenic influence on drying trends over Northeast Asia during 1948–2010 from the observational records. Decomposition analysis revealed that the exacerbation of drying trends over Northeast Asia is largely driven by evapotranspiration forcing, which contributed to approximately 64 % of the drying trend and almost doubled that attributed to precipitation deficit. The acceleration of the drying trend by evapotranspiration forcing was mainly attributable to anthropogenic warming effect on potential evapotranspiration (PET). Considering the integrated effect of anthropogenic forcing on both PET and precipitation, the results showed that anthropogenic forcing has increased the extent of the drying trend area by ∼21 % over Northeast Asia during 1948–2010. In particular, the magnitudes of drying trends were significantly amplified by anthropogenic forcing, resulting in an expansion of the areas with enhanced drying trend by ∼43 %. These findings provide compelling evidence of a human influence on half century-scale drying trends over Northeast Asia, implying the overall likelihood of drought events increasing in this region due to anthropogenic forcing."

 The land surface layer is an important interface between the ground and atmosphere, and cross-surface ground heat flux (G0) has a significant impact on land surface energy processes and associated cycles. Therefore, understanding dynamics in G0 is critical for predicting climate changes and developing adaptation strategies. However, the harsh environment and geographic barriers of the Tibetan Plateau have led to a significant lack of observations and soil samples, ultimately limiting the accuracy and application of G0 calculations. Here we investigated the changes in G0 at the BJ station, a typical seasonally frozen ground region of the Tibetan Plateau, through soil sampling and long-term in-situ observations. We used the calorimetric method to minimize reliance on model assumptions, aiming to achieve consistent and broadly applicable results. During the freezing-to-thawing and thawing-to-freezing stages, daytime G0 decreased while nighttime G0 increased. Conversely, daytime G0 increased while nighttime G0 decreased in the completely thawed and completely frozen stages. In moist conditions, more energy was directed toward soil moisture evaporation and vegetation transpiration, whereas in dry conditions, net radiation primarily increased soil temperature, enhancing G0. Our results revealed the dynamic changes in G0 across different environmental conditions and their impact on land-atmosphere interactions, and that climate warming and humidifying will diminish the regulatory capacity of G0. This study highlights the essential requirement for accurate G0 to predict future climate changes accurately, emphasizing its importance for researchers focusing on land-atmosphere feedback mechanisms and climate modeling."

 The Tibetan Plateau, particularly the eastern Tibetan Plateau (ETP), experienced extraordinarily high surface air temperature (SAT) anomalies in summer 2022. This study investigated the impact of anomalous soil moisture (SM) on the SAT over the ETP and explored the synergistic effect of SM and sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies on the ETP SAT during 1961–2022. It is found that the anomalous SM in the region from the eastern European Plain to the western Siberia Plain (EEP-WSP) remarkably affects the summer SAT over the ETP. Corresponding to lower EEP-WSP SM, the overlying upper-level higher geopotential height appears and stimulates downstream wave train from the EEP-WSP region to ETP, thereby affecting atmospheric circulation and associated SAT anomalies over the ETP. Since warmer SST anomalies in the Barents Sea and Black Sea contribute to the lower EEP-WSP SM anomalies (i.e., drier soil), the EEP-WSP SM can be considered a critical factor in bridging the Barents Sea and Black Sea SST anomalies and the ETP SAT. Moreover, the EEP-WSP SM can independently modulate the ETP SAT even when the effects of the SST anomalies are removed. The variability in the EEP-WSP SM is independent of that in the Yellow-Japan Sea (YJS) SST. Accordingly, the EEP-WSP SM and YJS SST can cooperatively and remarkably adjust the summer SAT over the ETP. The synergistic effect of EEP-WSP SM and YJS SST can regulate the ETP SAT on various (interannual, interdecadal, and trend) timescales and explain well the 2022 SAT anomaly over the ETP."

 Clouds are one of the key factors influencing the evolution of the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Understanding the complex interactions between clouds and PBL height (PBLH) is essential for accurately simulating and predicting PBL processes. This study investigates the impact of clouds on PBLH evolution based on the lidar, radiosonde, ceilometer, and meteorological parameters observations at the Southern Great Plains site during the period January 2013 to December 2020. The findings indicates that the presence of clouds has an impact on the evolution of the PBLH. During the daytime, PBLH is lower under cloudy conditions than clear conditions, whereas during nighttime, PBLH is higher under cloudy conditions. This phenomenon arises because the intense solar radiation on clear days and strong turbulent mixing on cloudy nights contribute to the formation and maintenance of PBLH. Furthermore, during the daytime, clouds scatter and absorb solar radiation, leading to lower net radiation (NetR), sensible heat flux (SHF), surface temperature (TEM), and soil temperature (SoilT). These conditions, coupled with weaker turbulence intensity and high relative humidity (RH), leading to lower PBLH under cloudy conditions. Although TEM and SoilT are relatively high during clear nights, rapid surface radiative cooling and strong atmospheric stability inhibit the development of the PBLH. Consequently, during cloudy nights, clouds absorb and reflect longwave radiation from the surface, reducing surface radiative cooling rates, enhancing atmospheric instability and turbulence intensity. Furthermore, higher NetR and SHF, along with decreased RH, result in slightly deeper PBLH compared to clear conditions. Overall, this study systematically elucidates the influence of clouds on PBLH evolution and contributes to the understanding of the modulation of cloud on PBL structure."

 A seesawing temperature pattern occurred over northern mid-latitudes in December 2023, with cold anomalies over northern parts of Eurasia and warm conditions over North America. The recurrent dipole temperature pattern in boreal winter has been revealed to be associated with concurrent changes in atmospheric variability (e.g., Siberian high and Alaska ridge) and boundary forcing (e.g., Arctic sea ice and North Atlantic sea surface temperature), whereas its precursor features remain less clear. Based on reanalysis data and two sets of coupled simulations, this study revealed that strong blocking activity over the Greenland-Eurasia sector in November was an important precursor to the remarkable “colder North Eurasia, warmer North America” pattern in December 2023. Increased tropospheric blocking frequency in November favored vertically propagating planetary waves to weaken the stratospheric polar vortex. The stratospheric response that persisted into December was characterized as the shift of polar vortex towards Eurasia and away from North America, linked to the enhanced zonal wavenumber-1 planetary waves. Downward propagation of the amplified wavenumber-1 component into the troposphere in December contributed to stronger continental high pressure over Eurasia and weaker ridge over Alaska, causing the “colder North Eurasia, warmer North America” pattern. High consistency between the results of observations and two sets of numerical simulations confirms the critical role of preceding tropospheric blocking, which is valuable for sub-seasonal prediction of the dipole temperature pattern across northern mid-latitudes."
