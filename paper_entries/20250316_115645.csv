This study examines how polyethylene spherical microplastics (275 μm in diameter) passing through the digestive tracts of crucian carp (Carassius carassius) and Australian crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus) affect surface properties, particle size, and bacterial colonization. The species were fed diets with or without microplastics. The particles underwent two rounds of passage through the digestive tracts and were then exposed to known bacterial densities. Surface damage, size, and biofilm coverage were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, while alterations in surface chemical composition were assessed through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance, and the formation and penetration of nanoplastics in gut tissues and glands were determined using Py-GC/MS. Results show that the passage significantly altered surface properties and reduced microplastic size, without affecting chemical composition or nanoplastic penetration into tissues. These changes promoted bacterial colonization compared to controls. The findings suggest that animal feeding activity may play an important role in the mechanical fragmentation of microplastics in aquatic environments, potentially leading to their faster degradation."

This study identified the structure-dependent impacts of PFAS on microbial fatty acid (FA) profiles by integrated field-laboratory investigations. The field investigation uncovered distinct PFAS-FA interaction patterns, varying by PFAS fluorocarbon (FC) chain length and functional group, and FA hydrocarbon (HC) chain length and unsaturation degree. Specifically, long-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs, FC7-17) increased medium/long-chain FAs (HC ≤ 17) and monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs), while long-chain perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs, FC6-8) enhanced longer-chain FAs (HC > 17) and MUFAs. Additionally, perfluoroether carboxylic acids (PFECAs) as well as short-chain PFCAs (FC < 7) and PFSAs (FC < 6), which commonly used as alternatives to long-chain PFCAs/PFSAs, were associated with polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs). The laboratory investigation with Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 validated these FA metabolic disruptions and revealed broader perturbations in phospholipids, acetyl-CoA, and secondary metabolite metabolisms, providing insights into dysregulated membrane synthesis, C/N metabolisms, and bacteria quorum sensing (QS) processes. These findings reveal novel structure-dependent effects of PFASs on microorganisms, highlighting microbial FA profiles as potential metabolic biomarkers for assessing PFAS toxicity and soil health."

Ma,Arsenic Uptake and Metabolism in Mycorrhizal As-Hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata: Symbiotic P Transporters and As Reductases,"Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) often protect host plants from As accumulation under arsenic stress; however, the opposite is true for the As-hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata. With non-hyperaccumulator Pteris ensiformis as a comparison, the AM colonization, P and As uptake, and genes associated with As metabolism were investigated in P. vittata after growing 60-day with Rhizophagus irregularis inoculation under 0 (As0), 10 (As10), or 100 μM As (As100) treatments. Based on the As-induced increase in AM colonization (up to 21%), AM symbiosis promoted P. vittata growth by 24% and frond P content by 22% in the AM+As100 treatment than As100 treatment. These increases corresponded to 4.2- to 5.4-fold upregulation in symbiotic P transporter RiPT1/7 in AM fungi and PvPht1;6 in P. vittata roots, which probably supported 37% greater As accumulation at 4980 mg kg–1 in the fronds. Besides total As, enhanced arsenate reduction was evidenced by 19% greater arsenite and 15-fold upregulation of fungal arsenate reductase RiArsC in mycorrhizal roots. Further, the 2.1-fold upregulation of arsenite antiporters PvACR3/3;3 contributed to greater arsenite translocation to and sequestration in the fronds. Unlike P. ensiformis symbiont, which suffers from As stress, the mycorrhiza-specific P transporters (RiPT1/7 and PvPht1;6), arsenate reductases (RiArsC and PvHAC2), and arsenite antiporters (PvACR3/3;3) all benefited AM symbiosis and As accumulation in P. vittata."

However, whether and how the widespread contaminant, perfluorobutanesulfonate (PFBS) affects intestinal remodeling remains unknown. In this study, tadpoles (Lithobates catesbeianus) at the G26 stage were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of PFBS (0, 1, 3, and 10 μg/L) until the end of metamorphosis. PFBS exposure resulted in reduced thyroid follicular glia; down-regulation of gene transcripts related to thyroid hormone synthesis; decreased blood hormone (corticotropin-releasing hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine (T3)) and transthyretin concentrations; and up-regulation of gene transcripts related to thyroid hormone degrading enzymes. Moreover, exposure to PFBS induced apoptosis in single-layer columnar epithelial cells, suppressed the proliferation of intestinal stem cells, and hindered their differentiation into adult epithelial cells during intestinal remodeling. The responses of Notch and Wnt signaling pathways regulated by T3 were downregulated, and key gene transcripts (msi, pcna, and lgr5) involved in intestinal remodeling regulated by these two pathways were also downregulated. This is the first report on the effects of PFBS on amphibian metamorphosis. Overall, PFBS reduced thyroid hormone synthesis and transport by interfering with the hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis and transthyretin expression, inhibited downstream Notch and Wnt signaling pathway responses, and ultimately led to incomplete intestinal remodeling to some extent."

Hatcher,Oxidation Camouflages Terrestrial Organic Matter to Appear Marine-like,"The export of terrestrial organic matter (TOM) to the ocean has been traditionally viewed to be minimal or only of significance in near-coastal continental margins. The broadly accepted explanation for the widespread loss of terrestrial lignin biomarkers and apparent disappearance of the <−25‰ stable carbon isotopic signature (δ13C) of TOM is that TOM is almost fully degraded before reaching the open ocean. Oceanic carbon (δ13C value ≥ −22‰) is therefore thought to be derived primarily from algae. However, an alternative explanation for the different molecular and δ13C signatures in terrestrial and marine environments may be that oxidative processing transforms TOM to appear marine-like. To test this hypothesis, we subjected eight TOM samples to a strong oxidation gradient. At carbon losses typical of TOM degradation during transport and sedimentation (above 60%), the differentiators of provenance disappeared, leaving a residue that was marine-like both chemically (aliphatic- and nitrogen-rich) and isotopically (δ13C enrichment of 4 to 9‰). This challenges the validity of conventional two-endmember mixing models, suggesting that a much larger fraction than previously estimated of the organic matter found in the ocean may originate from terrestrial sources, impacting global models of carbon cycling and sequestration."

However, few studies addressed its effectiveness in engineering practices as well as the impact on the groundwater environment. In this study, a field demonstration was conducted to investigate the efficiency of O3MNBEO in remediating groundwater contaminated by various organic compounds. The O3MNBEO technology exhibited high removal efficiencies ranging from 85 to 100% for benzene and significantly reduced the concentration of naphthalene, toluene, and petroleum hydrocarbons in 5-day remediation. Groundwater remediation using the O3MNBEO technology required less energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Moreover, O3MNBEO had no significant effect on groundwater pH and conductivity, and the oxidation–reduction potential (ORP) in groundwater and dissolved oxygen (DO) was substantially increased during the remediation process. The variations in ORP demonstrated a correlation with the contaminant concentration, which could serve as a potential indicator for assessing remediation progress. It is also worth noting that the presence of preferential seepage channels in the strata allows for the rapid migration of ozone MNBs, extending the reach of ozone MNBs. This study demonstrates that O3MNBEO is an efficient, practical, green, and sustainable technology that can be applied to in situ remediation of organics-contaminated groundwater."

Tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphate (TDtBPP) is a novel organophosphate ester contaminant detected in natural waters. However, the potential effects of maternal exposure to TDtBPP on the early development of offspring embryos in fish remain unknown. Here, 30-day-old zebrafish were exposed to TDtBPP at 0, 50, 500, or 5000 ng/L for 180 days, and the exposed females were spawned with unexposed males. TDtBPP accumulation was detected in offspring embryos, accompanied by an increased malformation rate and mortality. The developmental abnormality of offspring embryos was identified to originate from the gastrula stage. Furthermore, based on transcriptome analysis, the down-regulation of RHO family interacting cell polarization regulator 2 gene (ripor2) was considered as a key toxic event, and this was confirmed in the subsequent knockdown experiment. Moreover, molecular docking studies and forkhead box O1 (foxO1) transcription factor inhibitor (AS1842856) exposure experiments demonstrated that the blockade of foxO1 transcriptional regulation was responsible for the decreased expression of ripor2. The results of this study demonstrated that the occurrence of developmental malformation and mortality in zebrafish offspring embryos following maternal TDtBPP exposure were triggered by the blockade of foxO1 transcriptional regulation and the consequent down-regulation of ripor2."

This approach allowed us to investigate the uptake coefficient of an isoprene-derived hydroxy–RO2, ISOPOO (HOC5H8OO·), onto deliquesced NaCl particles and the effect of transition metal ions (Fe2+ and Cu2+) on this uptake. We measured the uptake coefficients, γ, of ISOPOO on deliquesced NaCl particles doped with FeCl2 and CuCl2, each added at 5 wt % of NaCl, at 301 K and 84% relative humidity (RH). The results were 0.45 ± 0.01 for FeCl2 and 0.19 ± 0.01 for CuCl2. These values were 5 and 2 times greater than the uptake coefficient for deliquesced undoped NaCl particles, which was 0.09 ± 0.01. Preliminary simulation results for the western Japan domain, using a value of γ = 0.09 from a three-dimensional chemical transport model, indicate that the heterogeneous uptake of ISOPOO onto deliquesced particles contributed, on average, less than 3% of the ISOPOO loss process. This contribution increased to as much as 5% in remote forest and mountain areas during high PM2.5 events."

Although prediction has several proposed applications, the potential benefit has remained largely unevaluated. This study examines whether prediction can improve how particle filter systems such as portable air cleaners are automated by comparing a model predictive control (MPC) strategy with a traditional threshold-based control (TBC) strategy. The MPC controller is designed to optimize the balance between mean reduction in PM2.5 concentration (i.e., keep concentrations as low as possible following health-based guidance) and reductions in system runtime. These two parameters are compared for both control strategies using 104 simulations of week-long continuous PM2.5 measurements in occupied apartments. Our findings suggest that there is no meaningful difference in performance between the two control strategies. Additionally, we find only a marginal improvement in performance for MPC controllers that operate using longer prediction horizons. Given the numerous challenges associated with accurately predicting future PM2.5 concentrations, as well as the additional challenges associated with implementing MPC, controlling particle filter systems may not be an appropriate application for prediction given the lack of benefit over TBC. We would recommend that particle filter systems continue to be controlled using nonpredictive strategies such as TBC, and that prediction tools be used for other applications or adapted to different areas of indoor air quality research and practice."

This study examined the impact of residential greenness on GWG and fetal intrauterine growth and assessed the mediating role of GWG. The research included 29406 births in Shanghai, utilizing the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to measure greenness within a 500 m radius (NDVI-500). The analysis employed a generalized linear model to assess the impacts of residental greenness on GWG, fetal growth and birthweight, and a mediation analysis to explore GWG’s role between greenness and fetal development. Results indicated that significant benefits were observed with increased greenness, where each 0.1 unit increase in NDVI-500 was associated with reductions of 9.4% (95% CI: 5.5%–13.2%) in the risk of head circumference undergrowth and 8.5% (95% CI: 4.8%–12.2%) in estimated fetal weight undergrowth. Additionally, each 0.1 unit increase in NDVI-500 was associated with reductions of 9.4% (95% CI: 5.1%–13.5%) and 9.2% (95% CI: 6.2%–12.0%) in the risk  of inadequate and excessive GWG, respectively. Notably, total GWG mediated 17.5% of the relationship between NDVI-500 and the birth weight. These findings suggest that enhancing residential greenness could be an effective public health strategy to improve pregnancy outcomes by promoting fetal growth and managing GWG, with the GWG partially mediating these benefits."

The size of volcanoes along the Hawai‘i–Emperor chain, and thus the magma flux of the Hawaiian plume, has varied over the past 85 million years. Fifteen and two million years ago, rapid bursts in magmatic production led to the emergence of large islands such as Pūhāhonu, Maui Nui and Hawai‘i, but the underlying mechanisms remain enigmatic. Here, we use new radiogenic Ce–Sr–Nd–Hf isotope data of Hawaiian shield lavas to quantify the composition and proportion of the different constituents of the Hawaiian plume over time. We find that most of the Hawaiian mantle source is peridotite that has experienced variable degrees of melt depletion before being incorporated into the plume. We show that the most isotopically enriched LOA‐type compositions arise from the aggregation of melts from more depleted, trace element‐starved peridotite, causing the over‐visibility of melts from recycled crust in the mixture. Our results also show that upwelling of chemically more depleted, and thus less dense, more buoyant mantle peridotite occurred synchronously to an observed burst of magma production. Buoyancy variations induced by variably depleted peridotite may not only control the temporal patterns of volcanic productivity in Hawai‘i, but also those of other plumes world‐wide. The excess buoyancy of depleted peridotite may therefore be an underrated driving force for convective mantle flow, trigger and sustain active upwelling of relatively cool plumes, and control the geometry of mantle upwellings from variable depths."

In surface waters of the chronically Fe‐limited North Pacific Subpolar Gyre, Fe‐marinobactin and Fe‐amphibactin siderophore concentrations reached 66 pM and accounted for up to 80% of dissolved Fe. Ferrioxamine/ferrichrome‐like siderophores, including ferricrocin, were abundant near the Alaskan coast.

Notably, the absolute change in ecosystem productivity to same amount of precipitation increase versus decrease may not be same. However, the generalization of this asymmetry, as well as its potential spatiotemporal variations, has rarely been assessed at the global scale. Here, we used multiple streams of satellite observation and found that asymmetry decreased along the humidity index gradient, indicating higher productivity pulse than decrease under dry climate conditions, and the asymmetry shifted from positive in dry areas to weakly negative in wet areas. Furthermore, the asymmetry increased significantly over the past two decades across most ecosystems. Climate change, particularly changes in precipitation, was the dominating factor behind the increasing global asymmetry over the last two decades. Our results suggest that increased precipitation variability may enhance vegetation productivity in arid regions, grassland, and shrub ecosystems, but could reduce productivity in forests."

Here, real surface pressure observations are assimilated into several popular ML models using an ensemble Kalman filter, where accurate ensemble covariance estimation is essential to constrain unobserved state variables from sparse observations. In this cycling DA system, deterministic ML models accumulate small‐scale noise until they diverge.

Different methods have been proposed to reduce this difference, however, very limited studies are focused on extreme low temperatures (ELT). Here we propose a new method to constrain the projection of ELT changes by establishing their quasi‐linear relationships with mean temperature (Tmean) in Eastern China. The results show that the Tmean weighting coefficients considering model performance and independence can effectively reduce the uncertainty range of future ELT. Before constraint, there are substantial differences in the projected ranges of Tmean and ELT between CMIP5 and CMIP6 models. After constraint, the projected ranges of CMIP6 models are considerably reduced, particularly at the warmer end, thus showing better consistency with CMIP5. Under the SSP5‐8.5 scenario, at the end of the 21st century (2081–2100), the original projected changes in Tmean are constrained from 5.1 (3.5–7.9)°C to 5.0 (3.5–6.5)°C, with the warmer end of the projected range decreased by 1.4°C. For the ELT, the decreases of the warmer ends are 1.9°C and 1.2°C for the annual minima of daily minimum (TNn) and maximum temperature (TXn), respectively. The reliability evaluation shows that the differences between pseudo‐observations represented by two large ensemble models and constrained projections are smaller than those for unconstrained projections, thereby confirming the reliability of the weighted method employed in this study."

This exchange is not well understood due to sparse observations in the atmosphere. There are currently no published vertical profiles of water isotopes above ice sheets that span the planetary boundary layer and portions of the free troposphere. Here, we present a novel data set of water‐vapor isotopes (δ18 ${\delta }^{18}$O, δ $\delta $D, dxs $dxs$) and meteorological variables taken by fixed‐wing uncrewed aircraft on the northeast Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS). During June–July (2022), we collected 104 profiles of water‐vapor isotopes and meteorological variables up to 1,500 m above ground level. Concurrently, surface snow samples were collected at 12‐hr intervals, allowing connection to surface‐snow processes. We pair observations with modeling output from a regional climate model as well as an atmospheric transport and water‐isotope distillation model. Climate model output of mean temperature and specific humidity agrees well with observations, with a mean difference of +0.095°C and −0.043 g/kg (−2.91%), respectively. We find evidence that along an air parcel pathway, the distillation model is not removing enough water prior to onsite arrival. Below the mean temperature inversion (∼ ${\sim} $200 m), water‐isotope observations indicate a kinetic fractionating process, likely the result of mixing sublimated vapor from the ice sheet surface along with an unknown fraction of katabatic wind vapor. Modeled dxs $dxs$ does not agree well with observations, a result that requires substantial future analysis of kinetic fractionation processes along the entire moisture pathway."

Model forecasts of environmental parameters can be linked to TC activity and then be used to extend the horizon of useful skill through statistical‐dynamical models. The aim of this work is to assess the utility of incorporating model forecasted environmental fields in a statistical model compared with skill coming from model forecasted Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) state in predicting TC activity over the Western North Pacific (WNP). In this study, we evaluate the European Center for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) from the Subseasonal‐to‐Seasonal (S2S) database and the Navy Earth System Prediction Capability (ESPC) as part of the Subseasonal Experiment on their ability to predict WNP TC activity using environmental fields. To isolate the environmental signals associated with subseasonal variability of TC activity, we examine events of anomalous accumulated cyclone energy, genesis, and TC days. These events are used to create composites of ERA5 reanalysis fields of environmental conditions related to WNP TC activity, which are used to select predictors for statistical dynamical hybrid models. The ECMWF statistical‐dynamical scheme exhibits an improvement in skill by using a tailored outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) predictor compared with the MJO predictors. The Navy‐ESPC generally performs worse than the ECMWF and has OLR biases that impede it from improving skill in the statistical‐dynamical schemes.

Harrington,Ice Crystal Habit Effects on the Resilience of Arctic Mixed‐Phase Stratus Clouds in a One‐Dimensional Model,"Arctic single‐layer mixed‐phase clouds were studied using a one‐dimensional model that incorporated the adaptive habit growth model for ice microphysics. The base case was from the Indirect and Semidirect Aerosol Campaign, and it was perturbed over a range of cloud‐average temperatures, maximum (per model run) ice nuclei (IN) concentrations, and large‐scale subsidence velocities. For each parameter combination, the model was iterated out to 48 hr, and the time, called the glaciation time, to complete disappearance of liquid recorded if this occurred within the 48 hr. Dependence of glaciation times on cloud‐average temperatures from −30°C to −5°C, maximum IN concentrations from 0.10 to 30 L−1, and strong–no subsidence, with both isometric and habit‐dependent ice crystal growth, were investigated. For isometric crystal growth, the relationship between the critical maximum IN concentration (INcrit), the maximum (per model run) IN concentration above which a mixed‐phase cloud glaciated within a fixed model runtime, and cloud‐average temperature was monotonic. INcrit decreased with decreasing cloud‐average temperature. Strengthening of subsidence led to a further decrease in INcrit for every cloud‐average temperature. For habit‐dependent ice crystal growth, the relationship between INcrit and cloud‐average temperature was nonmonotonic. Ice crystals develop dendritic and columnar habits near −15°C and −7°C, respectively, and at these two temperatures, ice crystals grew and depleted supercooled liquid water faster than the case when ice crystals grew isometrically. This led to deep local minima in INcrit around these two temperatures in the model runs. Habit‐dependent ice crystal growth, coupled with changes in cloud‐average temperature, INcrit, and subsidence strength, led to significant changes in Arctic single‐layer mixed‐phase cloud lifetimes."

While the impacts of pandemic‐associated plastic waste on multiple environmental matrices (e.g., water and soil) have been well documented, its effects on MPs in atmospheric fine particles (PM2.5) remain unclear. In this study, we analyzed the MPs in ambient PM2.5 collected from urban Xi'an before, during, and after the COVID‐19 pandemic in both summer and winter. Mean MP concentrations during and after the pandemic were three times higher than prepandemic levels, irrespective of the season. Transparent and white polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate fibers dominated during and after the pandemic, while prepandemic MPs were more diverse in polymer types and colors. These results indicate a strong impact of pandemic‐associated waste, especially discarded face masks, on the abundance and characteristics of MPs in ambient PM2.5. Additionally, a positive correlation was found between MPs and ambient ozone, suggesting the potential for ozone to degrade plastics and release MPs into the air. Multiple‐path particle dosimetry calculations revealed that MPs primarily deposit in the extrathoracic region of people across all age groups. However, teenagers and younger individuals showed increased susceptibility to deposition in tracheobronchial and pulmonary regions. Based on the estimated daily dose, inhalation of MPs from ambient PM2.5 is proposed to be a significant exposure pathway for humans. Overall, our study highlights the substantial impacts of pandemic‐associated plastic waste on MPs in ambient PM2.5 and their potential implications for human exposure."

Persistent volcano emission in the vicinity of Arequipa makes it among the largest SO2 sources in the world. Because volcano plumes mostly exist in the free troposphere and stratosphere where horizontal transport acts rather quickly, previous studies mostly focused on their global‐scale impacts. Whether these plumes can affect near‐surface air quality has not attracted much research attention. This study uses WRF‐Chem simulations to reveal that in the presence of northerly/northwesterly winds and favorable mountain meteorology, the plume from volcano Sabancaya (elevation 5,960 m, ∼80 km north of Arequipa) can be brought down to near the surface of Arequipa through two steps of transport and dispersion processes: (a) With northerly/northwesterly winds, the free troposphere plume from Sabancaya is transported southward and intercepted by Mountain Chachani located between Sabancaya and Arequipa and subsequently transported downward to Arequipa by nighttime downslope winds linked to large‐amplitude lee‐side mountain gravity waves. Often the plume reaches down to be close to the boundary layer over Arequipa. (b) In the following day, convective boundary layer growth brings the above boundary‐layer plume to near the surface through vertical mixing processes, thus exacerbating ambient air pollution in Arequipa. A mechanism on how volcano plumes above 6‐km height cause air pollution over the lower‐lying Arequipa city is therefore revealed for the first time. The mountain dynamic effect in inducing the large‐amplitude mountain lee waves is further illustrated by an idealized simulation excluding mountain's thermal effect."

However, the roles of SM and VPD on GPP vary widely in terms of (a) which one dominates the impact (dominance) and (b) the specific threshold values at which they are activated (thresholds). This study adopted the copula method to investigate the dominance and thresholds of SM and VPD on terrestrial vegetation productivity reduction (GPP reduction) across China from 1982 to 2018. The results indicate that SM predominantly drives the GPP reduction across 71% of China's vegetation zones, with the SM thresholds decreasing from the south to the north. Vapor pressure deficit dominated the GPP reduction primarily in the croplands with low VPD thresholds, such as the North China Plain and Northeast Plain. Moreover, the SM and VPD thresholds have significant difference across different ecosystems, with higher SM thresholds (activated under wetter soil conditions) in the forests and lower VPD thresholds (activated under more humid atmospheric conditions) in the croplands. Compared with the non‐irrigated croplands, irrigation can significantly reduce SM thresholds and increase VPD thresholds by relieving water stress from soil and atmospheric dryness. The structural equation modeling further demonstrates the dominant influence of SM and VPD on GPP reduction. This study explicitly identified the spatial distribution of the dominance and thresholds of soil and atmospheric dryness across different ecosystems. It could enhance our understanding of terrestrial ecosystem sensitivity to drought and provide guidance for drought management in different ecosystems."

 Late-stage deuteration of aryl halides with deuterium oxide is a highly desirable but challenging transformation, primarily due to the difficulty of activating inert carbon-halogen bonds and the umpolung of deuterium oxide in the presence of various functional groups.

 Gene expression in response to environmental stimuli is dependent on nuclear localization of key signaling components, which can be tightly regulated by phosphorylation. This is exemplified by the phosphate-sensing transcription factor Pho4, which requires phosphorylation for nuclear export by the yeast exportin Msn5. Here, we present a high resolution cryogenic-electron microscopy structure showing the phosphorylated 35-residue nuclear export signal of Pho4, which binds the concave surface of Msn5 through two Pho4 phospho-serines that align with two Msn5 basic patches. These findings characterize a mechanism of phosphate-specific recognition mediated by a non-classical signal distinct from that for Exportin-1. Furthermore, the discovery that unliganded Msn5 is autoinhibited explains the positive cooperativity of Pho4/Ran-binding and proposes a mechanism for Pho4’s release in the cytoplasm. These findings advance our understanding of the diversity of signals that drive nuclear export and how cargo phosphorylation is crucial in regulating nuclear transport and controlling cellular signaling pathways.

It reveals unique resilience patterns and quantifies the effects of renewable integration and energy storage. 
 Climate extremes, such as hurricanes, combined with large-scale integration of environment-sensitive renewables, could exacerbate the risk of widespread power outages. We introduce a coupled climate-energy model for cascading power outages, which comprehensively captures the impacts of climate extremes on renewable generation, and transmission and distribution networks. The model is validated with the 2022 Puerto Rico catastrophic blackout during Hurricane Fiona – a unique system-wide blackout event with complete records of weather-induced outages. The model reveals a resilience pattern that was not captured by the previous models: early failure of certain critical components enhances overall system resilience. Sensitivity analysis on various scenarios of behind-the-meter solar integration demonstrates that lower integration levels (below 45%, including the current level) exhibit minimal impact on system resilience in this event. However, surpassing this critical level without pairing it with energy storage can exacerbate the probability of catastrophic blackouts. This study develops a climate-energy model for cascading power outages during climate extremes, validated by Hurricane Fiona’s blackout.

This randomised controlled trial shows that the same intervention, given in addition to standard therapy, did not improve anthropometric or neurodevelopmental outcomes in children with complicated severe acute malnutrition in Pakistan. 
 We have previously shown that high-dose vitamin D3 improved weight gain and neurodevelopmental indices in children receiving standard therapy for uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition (SAM). Here we present results of a randomised placebo-controlled trial in Lahore, Pakistan, to determine whether two oral doses of 200,000 international units (IU) vitamin D3 (the first administered on or before the day of hospital discharge and the second administered 14 days later) would benefit children aged 6-59 months during the convalescent phase of complicated SAM. Eligible participants were individually randomised to intervention vs. control arms with a one-to-one allocation ratio and stratification by hospital of recruitment using computer-generated random sequences. Double-blinding to treatment allocation was maintained by concealing allocation from participants’ parents or guardians, their medical care providers, and all trial staff. The primary outcome was mean weight-for-height or -length z-score (WHZ) at 2-month follow-up. Secondary efficacy outcomes included mean WHZ at 6-month follow-up and mean lean mass index, Malawi Development Assessment Tool (MDAT) scores and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations at 2- and 6-month follow-up. The trial has now completed. 259 children were randomised (128 to vitamin D, 131 to placebo), of whom 251 (96.9%) contributed data to analysis of the primary outcome (123 allocated to vitamin D, 128 to placebo). At 2-month follow-up, participants allocated to vitamin D had significantly higher mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations than those allocated to placebo (adjusted mean difference [aMD] 100.0 nmol/L, 95% confidence interval [CI] 72.2–127.8 nmol/L). This was not associated with an inter-arm difference in mean WHZ at 2-month follow-up (aMD 0.02, 95% CI −0.20 to 0.23), or in any anthropometric or neurodevelopmental secondary outcome assessed at 2- or 6-month follow-up. The intervention was safe. In conclusion, high-dose vitamin D3 elevated mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations in children receiving standard therapy for complicated SAM in Pakistan, but did not influence any anthropometric or neurodevelopmental outcome studied. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with the identifier NCT04270643.

The emissions from a research ship engine operated with either low sulfur heavy fuel oil (LS-HFO) (FSC = 0.5%) or marine gas oil (MGO) (FSC = 0.01%), were photochemically processed in the oxidation flow reactor “PEAR” to achieve an equivalent photochemical age between 0 and 9 days in the atmosphere. FSC was found to have no significant impact on secondary organic aerosol formation after 3 days of aging, at 1.7 ± 0.4 g/kg for MGO and 1.5 ± 0.4 g/kg for LS-HFO.

 The influence of solar variation on climate has long been debated. Here, we utilize a decadal-resolved speleothem δ18O record from Vietnam, spanning 32.5 to 27.5 kyr BP, as a proxy for regional precipitation levels. Our results show a general coherence between Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) and regional precipitation, supporting a positive climate response consistent with conventional monsoon theory. Spectral analysis on studied datasets reveals an approximately 180-year periodicity coinciding with the de Vries cycle of solar activity. Further comparing our record with 35 other speleothem records, we demonstrate the importance of sufficient age control points in capturing solar-related periodicities. Model simulation shows that TSI could enhance monsoonal circulation and regional precipitation. Also highlighted are the implications of chronology control for detecting climate events in proxy records. The new findings underscore the significance of relatively minor radiative forcing in regional climate dynamics over monsoonal Asia on decadal to centennial timescales."

 The warming climate strongly impacts vegetation phenology, altering the terrestrial carbon cycle, biodiversity, and food production. Here, we analyzed satellite observations from 1982 to 2015 and found that approximately one-third of vegetated areas experienced a significant shift in the timing of the start of the growing season (SOS), with 65.5% exhibiting an earlier trend and 34.5% a delay. We revealed that these changes in SOS were significantly associated with temperature variations, with a response depending on the differences between seasonal temperature and optimal growing temperature for vegetation (ΔT). When ΔT < 0 (seasonal temperature below optimal temperature), warming accelerates the photosynthetic process, leading to an earlier SOS. Conversely, when ΔT > 0, vegetation may experience photosynthetic inhibition induced by rising temperature, delaying SOS. Based on these findings, trends of earlier SOS can be expected to gradually decelerate and even potentially transition into delayed shifts with additional warming in the future. The difference between the seasonal temperature and optimal growing temperature for vegetation plays a crucial role in the timing of the start of the growing season, according to a climate dataset analysis between 1982 and 2015 coupled with remote sensing."

 Altered fire regimes are a global challenge, increasingly exacerbated by climate change, which modifies fire weather and prolongs fire seasons. These changing conditions heighten the vulnerability of ecosystems and human populations to the impacts of wildfires on the environment, society, and the economy. The rapid pace of these changes exposes significant gaps in knowledge, tools, technology, and governance structures needed to adopt informed, holistic approaches to fire management that address both current and future challenges. Integrated Fire Management is an approach that combines fire prevention, response, and recovery while integrating ecological, socio-economic, and cultural factors into management strategies. However, Integrated Fire Management remains highly context-dependent, encompassing a wide array of fire management practices with varying degrees of ecological and societal integration.

 Satellite video, as an emerging data source for Earth observation, enables dynamic monitoring and has wide-ranging applications in diverse fields. Nevertheless, cloud occlusion hinders the ability of satellite video to provide uninterrupted monitoring of the Earth’s surface. To mitigate the interference of clouds, cloud-free areas need to be selected before application, or an optimized solution like a cloud removal algorithm can be utilized to recover the occluded regions, both of which inherently demand the precise detection of clouds. However, no existing methods are capable of robust cloud detection in satellite videos. We propose the first sub-second-level satellite video cloud detection model VCDFormer to handle this problem. In VCDFormer, a spatial–temporal-enhanced transformer consisting of a local spatial–temporal reconfiguration block and a spatial-enhanced block is introduced to explore global spatial–temporal correspondence efficiently. Additionally, we construct WHU-VCD, the first sub-second-level synthetic dataset specifically designed to capture the more realistic motion characteristics of both thick and thin clouds in satellite videos. Compared to the state-of-the-art cloud detection methods, VCDFormer achieves an approximate 10%–15% improvement in the IoU metric and a 5%–8% increase in the F1-Score on the simulated test set.

 High-resolution (≤10 m) digital elevation models (DEMs) are essential for obtaining accurate terrain information and are integral to geographic analysis. However, a majority of currently available DEMs datasets possess a relatively coarse spatial resolution (≥30 m), which limits the terrain features and details that can be accurately represented. Furthermore, due to the substantial production costs associated with high-resolution DEMs, these products are often unavailable or difficult to obtain in numerous countries and regions, particularly in less developed areas. Here, we introduced a novel method named the Spatial interpolation knowledge-constrained Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (SikCGAN). This method can generate high-resolution DEMs from publicly available data sources, specifically the photons collected by the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) carried by the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2). SikCGAN takes ICESat-2/ATLAS photons as the single data source and incorporates spatial interpolation knowledge constraints into a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) to generate DEMs at a 10-m spatial resolution. A case study conducted in boreal mountainous regions demonstrates SikCGAN’s remarkable ability to produce high-resolution and highly accurate DEMs, with an MAE of 22.09 m and RMSE of 29.25 m, which reduced error by 37 %–46 % compared to benchmark methods. Additionally, the results reveal that SikCGAN has remarkable resiliece to interference, including variations in spatial distance, terrain slope, and ATL03 photon count, this further elucidates and substantiates the effectiveness of SikCGAN. These findings demonstrate that SikCGAN provides innovative solutions for generating new high-resolution DEMs products and potentially supplementing existing ones to overcome their limitations."

Traditional studies focus on rapid crack-propagation detachment and account only for short-term adhesion governed by interfacial-viscoelastic dissipation, failing to explain long-term phenomena like sudden detachment after prolonged adherence and to predict corresponding adhesion lifetimes. Here, we investigate the long-term adhesion through a rheological paradigm using both theory and experiment. By considering both the bulk rheology and interfacial viscoelasticity mechanisms, we show that long-term adhesion durability is governed by the competition between them. This understanding leads to accurate lifetime predictions, which we validate through experiments. In addition, our study reveals a previously undocumented, counterintuitive phenomenon unique to long-term adhesion: the expansion of the contact area under tensile forces, in contrast to short-term adhesion in which the contact area always shrinks during detachment. This research fills a critical gap in adhesion physics."
