We explored highly oxygenated organic molecule (HOM) formation from ∆3-carene ozonolysis in chambers and investigated the impact of temperature and relative humidity on HOM formation. Our findings provide new insights into ∆3-carene oxidation pathways and their potential to impact atmospheric aerosols. 
 Δ3-carene is a prominent monoterpene in the atmosphere, contributing significantly to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. However, knowledge about Δ3-carene oxidation pathways, particularly regarding their ability to form highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs), is still limited. In this study, we present HOM measurements during Δ3-carene ozonolysis under various conditions in two simulation chambers. We identified numerous HOMs (monomers: C7−10H10−18O6−14; dimers: C17−20H24−34O6−18) using a chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS). Δ3-carene ozonolysis yielded higher HOM concentrations than α-pinene, with a distinct distribution, indicating differences in formation pathways. All HOM signals decreased considerably at lower temperatures, reducing the estimated molar HOM yield from ∼ 3 % at 20 °C to ∼ 0.5 % at 0 °C. Interestingly, the temperature change altered the HOM distribution, increasing the observed dimer-to-monomer ratios from roughly 0.8 at 20 °C to 1.5 at 0 °C. HOM monomers with six or seven O atoms condensed more efficiently onto particles at colder temperatures, while monomers with nine or more O atoms and all dimers condensed irreversibly even at 20 °C. Using the gas- and particle-phase chemistry kinetic multilayer model ADCHAM, we were also able to reproduce the experimentally observed HOM composition, yields, and temperature dependence.",Yuanyuan Luo;Ditte Thomsen;Emil Mark Iversen;Pontus Roldin;Jane Tygesen Skønager;Linjie Li;Michael Priestley;Henrik B.

The DCSs over the TP are less frequent, showing narrower and thinner cores and anvils compared to those over the TO. TP DCSs show a stronger longwave cloud radiative effect at the surface and in the low-level atmosphere. Distinct aerosol–cloud–precipitation interaction is found in TP DCSs, probably due to the cold cloud bases. 
 Using spaceborne lidar and radar observations, this study identifies deep convection systems (DCSs), including deep convection cores (DCCs) and anvils, over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and tropical Indian Ocean (TO) and finds that DCSs over the TP are less frequent, exhibiting narrower and thinner DCCs and anvils compared to those over the TO. The thinner DCCs over the TP exert weaker radiative cooling effects at the top of atmosphere (TOA) compared to the TO. But, the shortwave TOA cloud radiative effect (CRE) of TP anvils is stronger than that of the TO possibly due to more densely packed cloud tops over the TP. It results in a stronger TOA CRE of DCSs over the TP than that of TO. In particular, the longwave CRE of DCSs over the TP is notably greater at surface and low-level atmosphere due to the distinct lower temperature and less water vapour. The width of DCSs shows a positive correlation with wind shear and atmospheric instability, and the underlying mechanisms are discussed. We also find that the impact of aerosols on cloud top heights and precipitation displays significant discrepancies between the two regions. It is because that the aerosol invigoration effect is less efficient on the TP DCSs, mainly attributed to the significantly colder cloud base. Due to competition between invigoration and direct/semi-direct radiative effects of aerosols, the correlation between precipitation and aerosols over the TP is not obvious. However, precipitation in the TO experiences invigoration followed by suppression with increasing aerosols, due to the dominance of aerosol radiative effects and enhancement entrainment under polluted conditions.",Yuxin Zhao;Jiming Li;Deyu Wen;Yarong Li;Yuan Wang;Jianping Huang,该研究利用空间激光雷达和雷达观测，对比分析了青藏高原和热带印度洋上空深对流系统的结构、辐射效应和降水特征。研究发现，青藏高原深对流系统频率较低，对流核心和砧状云更窄更薄，且对流核心顶部辐射冷却效应较弱，但砧状云的短波辐射效应更强。青藏高原深对流系统在表面和低层大气中表现出更强的长波辐射效应，这可能与较低的温度和较少的水汽有关。此外，研究还发现，青藏高原深对流系统中气溶胶对云顶高度和降水的影響与热带印度洋存在显著差异，这可能是由于青藏高原深对流系统云底温度较低，气溶胶的增强效应效率较低。
10.5194/essd-2024-299,Earth System Science Data Discussions,False,"['soil properties', 'land surface modeling', 'hydrological', 'ecological analyses', 'earth system modeling']",A China dataset of soil properties for land surface modeling (version 2),"In this study, we developed the second version of China's high-resolution soil information grid using legacy soil samples and advanced machine learning. This version predicts over 20 soil properties at six depths, providing accurate soil variation maps across China. It outperforms previous versions and global products, offering valuable data for hydrological, ecological analyses, and earth system modeling, enhancing understanding of soil roles in environmental processes. 
 Accurate and high-resolution spatial soil information is crucial for efficient and sustainable land use, management, and conservation. Since the establishment of digital soil mapping (DSM) and the GlobalSoilMap working group, significant advances have been made in spatial soil information globally. However, accurately predicting soil variation over large and complex areas with limited samples remains a challenge, especially for China, which has diverse soil landscapes. To address this challenge, we utilized 11,209 representative multi-source legacy soil profiles (including the Second National Soil Survey of China, World Soil Information Service, First National Soil Survey of China, and regional databases) and high-resolution soil-forming environment characterization. Using advanced Quantile Regression Forest algorithms and a high-performance parallel computing strategy, we developed comprehensive maps of 23 soil physical, chemical and fertility properties at six standard depth layers from 0 to 2 meters in China with a 90 m spatial resolution (China dataset of soil properties for land surface modeling version 2, CSDLv2). Data-splitting and independent samples validation strategies were employed to evaluate the accuracy of the predicted maps quality. The results showed that the predicted maps were significantly more accurate and detailed compared to traditional soil type linkage methods (i.e., CSDLv1, the first version of the dataset), SoilGrids 2.0, and HWSD 2.0 products, effectively representing the spatial variation of soil properties across China. The prediction accuracy of most soil properties at the 0–5 cm depth interval ranged from good to moderate, with Model Efficiency Coefficients for most soil properties ranging from 0.75 to 0.32 during data-splitting validation and from 0.88 to 0.25 during independent sample validation. The wide range between the 5 % lower and 95 % upper prediction limits may indicate substantial room for improvement in current predictions. The relative importance of environmental covariates in predictions varied with soil properties and depth, indicating the complexity of interactions among multiple factors in the soil formation processes. As the soil profiles used in this study mainly originate from the Second National Soil Survey of China during 1970s and 1980s, they could provide new perspectives of soil changes together with existing maps based on 2010s soil profiles. The findings make important contributions to the GlobalSoilMap project and can also be used for regional Earth system modeling and land surface modeling to better represent the role of soil in hydrological and biogeochemical cycles in China.

AeroMix’s performance in modeling aerosol mixing states has been evaluated against field measurements, substantiating its potential as a versatile aerosol optical model framework for next-generation algorithms to infer aerosol mixing states and chemical composition. 
 Assessing aerosol mixing states, which primarily depend on aerosol chemical compositions, is indispensable to estimate direct and indirect effects of aerosols. The limitations of the direct measurements of aerosol chemical composition and mixing states necessitate modeling approaches to infer the aerosol mixing states. The Optical Properties of Aerosols and Clouds (OPAC) model has been extensively utilized to construct optically equivalent aerosol chemical compositions from measured aerosol optical properties using Mie inversion. However, the representation of real atmospheric aerosol mixing scenarios in OPAC has perennially been challenged by the exclusive assumption of external mixing. A Python successor to the aerosol module of the OPAC model is developed, named AeroMix, with novel capabilities to (1) model externally and core–shell mixed aerosols, (2) simulate optical properties of aerosol mixtures constituted by any number of aerosol components, and (3) define aerosol composition and relative humidity in up to six vertical layers. Designed as a versatile open-source aerosol optical model framework, AeroMix is tailored for sophisticated inversion algorithms aimed at modeling aerosol mixing states and also their physical and chemical properties. AeroMix's performance is demonstrated by modeling the probable aerosol mixing states over Kanpur (urban) and the Bay of Bengal (marine) in south Asia. The modeled mixing states are consistent with independent measurements using a single-particle soot photometer (SP2) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), substantiating the potential capability of AeroMix to model complex aerosol mixing scenarios involving multiple internally mixed components in diverse environments. This work contributes a valuable tool for modeling aerosol mixing states to assess their impact on cloud-nucleating properties and radiation budget.",Sam P.

To better understand it, we present a method to change it in numerical model experiments. We show that the method works well in four different models. The behavior of the width is unexpectedly simple in some ways, such as how strong the winds are as it changes, but in other ways, it is more complicated, especially how temperature increases with carbon dioxide. 
 The width of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) affects tropical rainfall, Earth's albedo, large-scale circulation, and climate sensitivity. To better understand the ITCZ width and its effects on global climate, we present a protocol to force changes in ITCZ width in climate models. Starting from an aquaplanet configuration with a slab ocean, adding surface heat fluxes in the deep tropics forces the ITCZ to narrow, and subtracting them causes it to widen. The protocol successfully generates changes in ITCZ width in all four climate models used in this study. ITCZ width in each model responds linearly to forcing magnitude and sign. Comparing across the four climate models, a response to varying ITCZ width that is remarkably consistent among models is the ITCZ strength, which is greater the narrower the ITCZ. On the other hand, the effect of varying ITCZ width on climate sensitivity is divergent among our four models, varying even in sign. Results from this pilot study highlight the connections between surface fluxes, ITCZ width, and the wider climate. A comprehensive model intercomparison project (MIP) has the potential to advance understanding of both the physical processes shaping ITCZ width and its influence on remote atmospheric circulations and global climate.",Angeline G.

 Across the stable density stratification of the abyssal ocean, deep dense water is slowly propelled upward by sustained, though irregular, turbulent mixing. The resulting mean upwelling determines large-scale oceanic circulation properties like heat and carbon transport. In the ocean interior, this turbulent mixing is caused mainly by breaking internal waves: generated predominantly by winds and tides, these waves interact nonlinearly, transferring energy downscale, and finally become unstable, break and mix the water column. This paradigm, long parameterized heuristically, still lacks full theoretical explanation. Here, we close this gap using wave-wave interaction theory with input from both localized and global observations. We find near-ubiquitous agreement between first-principle predictions and observed mixing patterns in the global ocean interior. Our findings lay the foundations for a wave-driven mixing parameterization for ocean general circulation models that is entirely physics-based, which is key to reliably represent future climate states that could differ substantially from today’s.

 Spatial omics technologies decipher functional components of complex organs at cellular and subcellular resolutions.

 Downward Surface Shortwave Radiation (DSSR) plays a crucial role in ecological, hydrological, and solar photovoltaic studies. The estimation of DSSR at higher spatial resolutions is increasingly popular. However, the impact of increasing spatial resolution on spatial information content and accuracy of DSSR estimates is not well understood. Addressing this knowledge gap, an all-sky DSSR dataset at varying spatial resolutions (0.8° to 0.01°) in China was estimated using MODIS top-of-atmosphere reflectance data. Subsequently, the spatial heterogeneity and accuracy of the DSSR dataset as well as its driving factors were analyzed. The results indicate that the magnitude of the increase in spatial heterogeneity varies across different regions as the spatial resolution increases. On the edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the spatial heterogeneity experiences the most significant increase. To quantify the factors driving the spatial heterogeneity of DSSR, the Correlation Coefficients (CC) were calculated between the Coefficient Of Variation (COV) of DSSR and the COVs of relevant factors. In cloudy-sky conditions, the CC between the COV of DSSR and cloud optical thickness ranged from 0.54 to 0.62, whereas the CC between DSSR COV and Column Water Vapor (CWV) COV was between 0.72 and 0.78. Under clear-sky conditions, the COV of CWV, aerosol optical depth, and PM2.5 showed more significant correlations with DSSR COV compared to altitude COV. Validation using ground-based measurements revealed that the accuracy of DSSR decreased at coarser spatial resolutions due to the presence of mixed pixel samples. Moreover, it was demonstrated that a spatial resolution of 0.05° offered the highest cost-effectiveness when estimating DSSR. These insights significantly advance our understanding of the role of spatial resolutions in DSSR estimation and are instrumental in guiding the selection of optimal resolutions for such studies.",Qin Lang;Lunche Wang;Wenmin Qin;Zhitong Wang;Xin Su;Ming Zhang,这篇研究论文主要探讨了不同空间分辨率对地表向下短波辐射（DSSR）估计的影响，并分析了其空间信息含量和准确性的变化。研究使用MODIS卫星数据，在不同空间分辨率下估算了中国地区的DSSR，并分析了DSSR的空间异质性和准确性，以及影响其变化的关键因素。研究发现，水汽的空间异质性对DSSR空间异质性的影响比云和气溶胶的影响更大，混合像素是导致粗空间分辨率DSSR精度下降的主要原因。研究还表明，0.05°的空间分辨率在DSSR估计中具有最高的成本效益。该研究结果有助于我们理解空间分辨率在DSSR估计中的作用，并为选择最佳空间分辨率提供指导。

Many models have tried and failed to fully capture the dynamics of these processes. We developed a comprehensive thermomechanical model that considers the transition from brittle to ductile behavior with depth, lithology-dependent erosion and observed decollement and backstop geometries. This model successfully reproduces the intricate structures observed within the Taiwan orogeny, aligns with structural complexities, metamorphic temperature profiles, thermochronological records, strain distributions, and the rates of exhumation and cooling and elucidates the roles of ductile deformation and ramp structures in forming the Hsuehshan Range and the Western fold and thrust belt.

10.1126/sciadv.adj2547,Science Advances,False,[],Cl−-dependent amplification of excitatory synaptic potentials at distal dendrites revealed by voltage imaging,"The processing of synaptic signals in somatodendritic compartments determines neuronal computation. Although the amplification of excitatory signals by local voltage-dependent cation channels has been extensively studied, their spatiotemporal dynamics in elaborate dendritic branches remain obscure owing to technical limitations. Using fluorescent voltage imaging throughout dendritic arborizations in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, we demonstrate a unique chloride ion (Cl−)–dependent remote computation mechanism in the distal branches. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials triggered by local laser photolysis of caged glutamate spread along dendrites, with gradual amplification toward the distal end while attenuation toward the soma. Tour de force subcellular patch-clamp recordings from thin branches complemented by biophysical model simulations revealed that the asymmetric augmentation of excitation relies on tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium ion (Na+) channels and Cl−conductance accompanied by a more hyperpolarized dendritic resting potential. Together, this study reveals the cooperative voltage-dependent actions of cation and anion conductance for dendritic supralinear computation, which can locally decode the spatiotemporal context of synaptic inputs.",Reo Higashi;Masato Morita;Shin-ya Kawaguchi,该研究主要关注海马体锥体神经元树突分支中兴奋性突触后电位的放大机制，利用荧光电压成像技术和膜片钳技术，揭示了氯离子依赖的远程计算机制。研究发现，氯离子通道和电压依赖性钠离子通道协同作用，导致树突远端兴奋性信号的放大，而近端信号则衰减。该研究与大气环境遥感技术无关，主要关注神经科学领域，研究的是神经元信号传递和处理的机制。
10.1126/sciadv.adk4062,Science Advances,False,[],Top-down modulation of the retinal code via histaminergic neurons of the hypothalamus,"The mammalian retina is considered an autonomous circuit, yet work dating back to Ramon y Cajal indicates that it receives inputs from the brain. How such inputs affect retinal processing has remained unknown. We confirmed brain-to-retina projections of histaminergic neurons from the mouse hypothalamus. Histamine application ex vivo altered the activity of various retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), including direction-selective RGCs that gained responses to high motion velocities. These results were reproduced in vivo with optic tract recordings where histaminergic retinopetal axons were activated chemogenetically. Such changes could improve vision of fast-moving objects (e.g., while running), which fits with the known increased activity of histaminergic neurons during arousal. An antihistamine drug reduced optomotor responses to high-speed moving stimuli in freely moving mice. In humans, the same antihistamine nonuniformly modulated visual sensitivity across the visual field, indicating an evolutionary conserved function of the histaminergic system. Our findings expose a previously unappreciated role for brain-to-retina projections in modulating retinal function.",Rebekah A. Warwick;Serena Riccitelli;Alina S.

10.1126/sciadv.ado4788,Science Advances,False,[],An AP2/ERF transcription factor confers chilling tolerance in rice,"Cold stress, a prominent adverse environmental factor, severely hinders rice growth and productivity. Unraveling the complex mechanisms governing chilling tolerance in rice is crucial for molecular breeding of cold-tolerant varieties. Here, we identify an APETALA2/Ethylene Responsive Factor (AP2/ERF) transcription factor, OsERF52, as a positive modulator in response to low temperatures. OsERF52 directly regulates the expression ofC-Repeat Binding Factor(CBF) genes in rice. In addition, Osmotic Stress/ABA-Activated Protein Kinase 9–mediated phosphorylation of OsERF52 at S261 enhances its stability and interaction with Ideal Plant Architecture 1 and OsbHLH002/OsICE1. This collaborative activation leads to the expression ofOsCBFs, thereby initiating the chilling response in rice. Notably, plants with base-editedOsERF52S261D-3HAexhibit enhanced chilling resistance without yield penalty. Our findings unveil the mechanism orchestrated by a regulatory framework involving a protein kinase and transcription factors from diverse families, offering potential genetic resources for developing chilling-tolerant rice varieties.",Liang Xu;Lijia Yang;Aipeng Li;Jiazhuo Guo;Huanyu Wang;Haoyue Qi;Ming Li;Pingfang Yang;Shiyong Song,这篇论文研究了水稻中一个名为OsERF52的转录因子在低温胁迫下的作用机制。研究发现，OsERF52通过直接调控CBF基因的表达，以及与其他转录因子和蛋白激酶的相互作用，来增强水稻的抗寒性。该研究揭示了水稻抗寒性的分子机制，为培育抗寒水稻品种提供了新的基因资源。

Despite over 30 years of numerous computational studies on magnetorotational turbulence, the properties of fluctuations in the inertial range—where cross-scale energy transfer dominates over energy injection—have remained elusive, primarily due to insufficient numerical resolution. Here, we report the highest-resolution simulation of magnetorotational turbulence ever conducted. Our simulations reveal a constant cross-scale energy flux, a hallmark of the inertial range. We found that as the cascade proceeds to smaller scales in the inertial range, the kinetic and magnetic energies tend toward equipartitioning with the same spectral slope, and slow magnetosonic fluctuations dominate over Alfvénic fluctuations, having twice the energy. These findings align remarkably with the theoretical expectations from the reduced magnetohydrodynamic model, which assumes a near-azimuthal mean magnetic field.

The molecular mechanism by which de novo DNA methyltransferase(s) [DNMT(s)] catalyze CpG methylation at PRC-regulated regions remains unclear. Here, we report a cryo–electron microscopy structure of the DNMT3A long isoform (DNMT3A1) amino-terminal region in complex with a nucleosome carrying PRC1-mediated histone H2A lysine-119 monoubiquitination (H2AK119Ub). We identify regions within the DNMT3A1 amino terminus that bind H2AK119Ub and the nucleosome acidic patch. This bidentate interaction is required for effective DNMT3A1 engagement with H2AK119Ub-modified chromatin in cells. Further, aberrant redistribution of DNMT3A1 to Polycomb target genes recapitulates the cancer-associated DNA hypermethylation signature and inhibits their transcriptional activation during cell differentiation. This effect is rescued by disruption of the DNMT3A1–acidic patch interaction. Together, our analyses reveal a binding interface critical for mediating promoter CpG island DNA hypermethylation, a major molecular hallmark of cancer.",Kristjan H.

Stem cells undergo asymmetric cell divisions to self-renew and to produce differentiating cells. Our research focused on unraveling the mechanisms governing the specification of these two distinct cell fates following the stem cell division. For this purpose, we used the model organismPhyscomitrium patens, which features a singular pluripotent stem cell known as the gametophore apical cell. We show that the activity of cytokinins, critical stem cell regulators, is restricted to the gametophore apical cell due to the specific localization of PpLOG, the enzyme responsible for cytokinin activation. In turn, PpTAW, which promotes differentiating cell identity of the merophyte, is excluded from the gametophore apical cell by the action of cytokinins. We propose a cytokinin-based model for the establishment of asymmetry in the pluripotent stem cell division.",Yuki Hata;Juri Ohtsuka;Yuji Hiwatashi;Satoshi Naramoto;Junko Kyozuka,这篇论文研究了苔藓植物Physcomitrium patens中顶端分生组织的细胞命运决定机制，主要关注了细胞分裂后细胞命运的决定。研究发现，细胞分裂素（cytokinin）在顶端分生组织中发挥重要作用，通过调节PpLOG和PpTAW蛋白的表达和定位来控制细胞的命运决定。该研究属于植物发育生物学领域，与大气环境遥感技术没有直接关系。

To explore this phenomenon, we set up mouse lymphoma models activating or not activating NK cells. Both tumor types elicited type I interferon production, leading to the expression of a T cell exhaustion-like signature in NK cells, which included immune checkpoint proteins (ICPs). However, NK cell dysfunction occurred exclusively in the tumor model that triggered NK cell activation. Moreover, ICP-positive NK cells demonstrated heightened reactivity compared to negative ones. Furthermore, the onset of NK cell dysfunction was swift and temporally dissociated from ICPs induction, which occurred as a later event during tumor growth. Last, NK cell responsiveness was restored when stimulation was discontinued, and interleukin-15 had a positive impact on this reversion. Therefore, our data demonstrate that the reactivity of NK cells is dynamically controlled and that NK cell dysfunction is a reversible process uncoupled from the expression of ICPs.",Kévin Pouxvielh;Marie Marotel;Annabelle Drouillard;Marine Villard;Marion Moreews;Anna Bossan;Mathilde Poiget;Liliane Khoryati;Sarah Benezech;Lucie Fallone;Sarah Hamada;Noémi Rousseaux;Louis Picq;Yamila Rocca;Aurore Berton;Marine Teixeira;Anne-Laure Mathieu;Michelle Ainouze;Uzma Hasan;Alain Fournier;Olivier Thaunat;Antoine Marçais;Thierry Walzer,这篇论文主要研究了肿瘤生长过程中自然杀伤细胞（NK细胞）的功能障碍问题。研究发现，肿瘤会诱导NK细胞表达免疫检查点蛋白（ICP），导致NK细胞功能下降。然而，NK细胞功能障碍的发生速度很快，并且与ICP的表达时间不一致。此外，研究还发现，NK细胞功能障碍是可逆的，可以通过停止刺激或使用白介素-15来恢复。这项研究主要关注的是免疫学领域，与大气环境遥感技术没有直接关系。

Microglia subsets with diverse functions and distinct developmental regulations have been identified recently. It is generally accepted that all microglia originate from hematopoiesis and depend on the myeloid transcription factor PU.1. However, a recent study reported the existence ofmrc1+microglia in zebrafish embryos, which are seemingly independent of Pu.1 and reliant on lymphatic vessels, sparking great interest in the possibility of lymphatic-originated microglia. To address this, we took advantage of apu.1knock-in zebrafish allele for a detailed investigation. Our results conclusively showed that almost all zebrafish embryonic microglia (~95% on average) expresspu.1. Further, lineage tracing and mutant analysis revealed that these microglia neither emerged from nor depended on lymphatic vessels.

Here, we isolated a narrow-leaf gene,TaWAK2-A, through a map-based cloning strategy.TaWAK2-Aencodes a wall-associated kinase (WAK), for which a single Ala-to-Val amino acid substitution reduces the protein stability, leading to a narrow-leaf phenotype in wheat. Further investigation suggests that TaWAK2 directly interacts with and phosphorylates TaNAL1, a trypsin-like serine/cysteine protease. The phosphorylated TaNAL1 is then involved in the degradation of the zinc finger transcription factor TaDST, which acts as a repressor of leaf expansion by activating the expression of the cytokinin oxidase geneTaCKX9and triggering in vivo cytokinin degradation. Therefore, our findings elucidate a signaling cascade involving TaWAK2-TaNAL1-TaDST that sheds light on the regulation of wheat leaf development.",Dejie Du;Zhaoju Li;Jun Yuan;Fei He;Xiongtao Li;Naijiao Wang;Renhan Li;Wensheng Ke;Dongxue Zhang;Zhaoyan Chen;Zihao Jiang;Yunjie Liu;Lingling Chai;Jie Liu;Zhaorong Hu;Weilong Guo;Huiru Peng;Yingyin Yao;Qixin Sun;Zhongfu Ni;Mingming Xin,该研究主要关注小麦叶片宽度调控的分子机制，通过定位和分析TaWAK2-A基因，揭示了TaWAK2-TaNAL1-TaDST信号通路在叶片发育中的作用。该研究与大气环境遥感技术无关，没有涉及空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析等方面。

Here, we identify the inaugural noncanonical strigolactone, 4-oxo-methyl carlactonoate (4-oxo-MeCLA), in rice root exudate. Comprehensive, cross-species coexpression analysis allowed us to identify a cytochrome P450, OsCYP706C2, and two methyl transferases as candidate enzymes for this noncanonical rice strigolactone biosynthetic pathway. Heterologous expression in yeast andNicotiana benthamianaindeed demonstrated the role of these enzymes in the biosynthesis of 4-oxo-MeCLA, which, expectedly, is derived from carlactone as substrate.

Here, we developed a temperature-responsive dual-hormone foam nanoengine (HormFoam) and combined it with a customized spraying device to further construct an in situ foam-generating system for improving the rectal bioavailability of dual-hormone therapy. To support rapid clinical translation, a continuous microfluidic preparation for HormFoam was proposed, including the power unit of perfluorocarbon nanodroplets and the pharmaceutical components Pluronic F127–functionalized liposomal insulin and pramlintide. We found that HormFoam could consistently generate foams to drive drugs forward after rectal administration, which enhanced intestinal distribution and mucosa absorption, leading to systemic codelivery of insulin-pramlintide. HormFoam reproduced the physiology of endocrine pancreas for glycemic control and induced body weight loss while reversing metabolic disorders in diabetic mice with good biosafety.

ENL relies on its reader domain to recognize histone lysine acylation promoting oncogenic gene expression and leukemia progression. Here, we report the development of MS41, a highly potent and selective von Hippel–Lindau–recruiting ENL degrader that effectively inhibits the growth of ENL-dependent leukemia cells. MS41-induced ENL degradation reduces the chromatin occupancy of ENL-associated transcription elongation machinery, resulting in the suppression of key oncogenic gene expression programs and the activation of differentiation genes. MS41 is well-tolerated in vivo and substantially suppresses leukemia progression in a xenograft mouse model ofMLL-rleukemia.

Here, we demonstrate that developmental DNA demethylation, driven by ten-eleven translocation 1/2/3 (TET1/2/3) enzymes, is essential for establishment of neural stem cell (NSC) identity and gliogenic potential. We find that loss of all three TETs during NSC specification is dispensable for neural induction and neuronal differentiation but critical for astrocyte and oligodendrocyte formation, demonstrating a selective loss of glial competence. Mechanistically, TET-mediated demethylation was essential for commissioning neural-specific enhancers in proximity to master neurodevelopmental and glial transcription factor genes and for induction of these genes. Consistently, loss of all three TETs in embryonic NSCs in mice compromised glial gene expression and corticogenesis. Thus, TET-dependent developmental demethylation is an essential regulatory mechanism for neural enhancer commissioning during NSC specification and is a cell-intrinsic determinant of NSC identity and gliogenic potential.",Ian C.

Computational design of IDPs with specific conformational properties has, however, been difficult because of their substantial dynamics and structural complexity. We describe a general algorithm for designing IDPs with specific structural properties. We demonstrate the power of the algorithm by generating variants of naturally occurring IDPs that differ in compaction, long-range contacts, and propensity to phase separate. We experimentally tested and validated our designs and analyzed the sequence features that determine conformations. We show how our results are captured by a machine learning model, enabling us to speed up the algorithm.

Similar to the interference of itinerant electrons scattered by defects in normal metals, these resonances reveal a periodic texture around the magnetic impurity. The wavelength of these resonances is, however, often too short to be resolved even by methods capable of atomic resolution, i.e., scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We combine a CO molecule with a superconducting cluster pre-attached to an STM tip to maximize both spatial and energy resolution, thus demonstrating the superior properties of such double-functionalized probes by imaging the spatial distribution of YSR states. Our approach reveals rich interference patterns of the hybridized YSR states of two Fe atoms on Nb(110), previously inaccessible with conventional STM probes.

The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) ESKAPE pathogens (particularly Gram-negative bacteria) accounts for high risk of mortality and increased resource utilization in health care. Worse still, there has been no new class of antibiotics approved for exterminating the Gram-negative bacteria for more than 50 years. Therefore, it is urgent to develop novel antibacterial agents with low resistance and potent killing efficacy against Gram-negative ESKAPE pathogens. Herein, we present a class of fluoropolymers by mimicking the amphiphilicity of cationic antimicrobial peptides.

10.1126/sciadv.adp8625,Science Advances,False,[],"Five centuries of consanguinity, isolation, health, and conflict in Las Gobas: A Northern Medieval Iberian necropolis","Between the 8th and 11th centuries CE, the Iberian Peninsula underwent profound upheaval due to the Umayyad invasion against the Visigoths, resulting in population shifts and lasting demographic impacts. Our understanding of this period is hindered by limited written sources and few archaeogenetic studies. We analyzed 33 individuals from Las Gobas, a necropolis in northern Spain, spanning the 7th to 11th centuries. By combining archaeological and osteological data with kinship, metagenomics, and ancestry analyses, we investigate conflicts, health, and demography of these individuals. We reveal intricate family relationships and genetic continuity within a consanguineous population while also identifying several zoonoses indicative of close interactions with animals. Notably, one individual was infected with a variola virus phylogenetically clustering with the northern European variola complex between ~885 and 1000 CE. Last, we did not detect a significant increase of North African or Middle East ancestries over time since the Islamic conquest of Iberia, possibly because this community remained relatively isolated.",Ricardo Rodríguez-Varela;Reyhan Yaka;Zoé Pochon;Iban Sanchez-Pinto;José Luis Solaun;Thijessen Naidoo;Benjamin Guinet;Patxi Pérez-Ramallo;Vendela Kempe Lagerholm;Violeta de Anca Prado;Cristina Valdiosera;Maja Krzewińska;Lourdes Herrasti;Agustín Azkarate;Anders Götherström,该研究主要关注的是西班牙北部Las Gobas墓地的考古学和遗传学分析，研究时间跨度为7世纪至11世纪。研究内容包括：通过分析33个个体的遗骸，揭示了该群体内部的亲缘关系、遗传连续性、动物疾病以及可能的瘟疫传播情况。研究结果表明，该群体在伊斯兰征服伊比利亚半岛后仍然保持着相对孤立的状态，并没有出现明显的北非或中东血统的增加。该研究与大气环境遥感技术无关。
10.1126/sciadv.adp2758,Science Advances,False,[],Millimeter-scale soft capsules for sampling liquids in fluid-filled confined spaces,"Sampling liquids in small and confined spaces to retrieve chemicals and microbiomes could enable minimally invasive monitoring human physiological conditions for understanding disease development and allowing early screening. However, existing tools are either invasive or too large for sampling liquids in tortuous and narrow spaces. Here we report a fundamental liquid sampling mechanism that enables millimeter-scale soft capsules for sampling liquids in confined spaces. The miniature capsule is enabled by flexible magnetic valves and superabsorbent polymer, fully wirelessly controlled for on-demand fluid sampling. A group of miniature capsules could navigate in fluid-filled and confined spaces safely using a rolling locomotion. The integration of on-demand triggering, sampling, and sealing mechanism and the agile group locomotion allows us to demonstrate precise control of the soft capsules, navigating and sampling body fluids in a phantom and animal organ ex vivo, guided by ultrasound and x-ray medical imaging. The proposed mechanism and wirelessly controlled devices spur the next-generation technologies for minimally invasive disease diagnosis.",Xiaoguang Dong;Boyang Xiao;Hieu Vu;Honglu Lin;Metin Sitti,该研究主要关注微型软胶囊在狭小空间内液体取样的应用，例如在人体器官中进行微创液体采样，用于疾病诊断和早期筛查。该研究与大气环境遥感技术关系不大，没有涉及空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析等方面。
10.1126/sciadv.adp3145,Science Advances,False,[],PneumaOCT: Pneumatic optical coherence tomography endoscopy for targeted distortion-free imaging in tortuous and narrow internal lumens,"The complex anatomy of internal luminal organs, like bronchioles, poses challenges for endoscopic optical coherence tomography (OCT). These challenges include limited steerability for targeted imaging and nonuniform rotation distortion (NURD) with proximal scanning. Using rotary micromotors for distal scanning could address NURD but raises concerns about electrical safety and costs. We present pneumaOCT, the first pneumatic OCT endoscope, comprising a steerable catheter with a soft pneumatic actuator and an imaging probe with a miniature pneumatic turbine. With a diameter of 2.8 mm, pneumaOCT allows for a bending angle of up to 237°, facilitating navigation through narrow turns. The pneumatic turbine enables adjustable imaging speeds from 51 to 446 revolutions per second. We demonstrate the pneumaOCT in vivo imaging of mouse esophagus and colon, as well as targeted and distortion-free imaging of peripheral bronchioles in a bronchial phantom and a porcine lung. This advancement substantially improves endoscopic OCT for navigational imaging in curved and narrow lumens.",Tinghua Zhang;Sishen Yuan;Chao Xu;Peng Liu;Hing-Chiu Chang;Sze Hang Calvin Ng;Hongliang Ren;Wu Yuan,该论文介绍了一种名为pneumaOCT的新的内窥镜光学相干断层扫描技术，它利用气动执行器和微型气动涡轮来实现可控的弯曲和成像。该技术旨在克服传统内窥镜OCT在狭窄弯曲腔体中成像的局限性，例如支气管。论文重点介绍了pneumaOCT在小鼠食道和结肠以及猪肺等生物体内的应用，展示了其在导航成像方面的优势。该技术与大气环境遥感技术无关。
10.1126/sciadv.ado3232,Science Advances,False,[],Irreversibility in bacterial regulatory networks,"Irreversibility, in which a transient perturbation leaves a system in a new state, is an emergent property in systems of interacting entities. This property has well-established implications in statistical physics but remains underexplored in biological networks, especially for bacteria and other prokaryotes whose regulation of gene expression occurs predominantly at the transcriptional level. Focusing on the reconstructed regulatory network ofEscherichia coli, we examine network responses to transient single-gene perturbations. We predict irreversibility in numerous cases and find that the incidence of irreversibility increases with the proximity of the perturbed gene to positive circuits in the network. Comparison with experimental data suggests a connection between the predicted irreversibility to transient perturbations and the evolutionary response to permanent perturbations.",Yi Zhao;Thomas P.

10.1126/sciadv.ado2733,Science Advances,False,[],The uniqueness of human vulnerability to brain aging in great ape evolution,"Aging is associated with progressive gray matter loss in the brain. This spatially specific, morphological change over the life span in humans is also found in chimpanzees, and the comparison between these great ape species provides a unique evolutionary perspective on human brain aging. Here, we present a data-driven, comparative framework to explore the relationship between gray matter atrophy with age and recent cerebral expansion in the phylogeny of chimpanzees and humans. In humans, we show a positive relationship between cerebral aging and cortical expansion, whereas no such relationship was found in chimpanzees. This human-specific association between strong aging effects and large relative cortical expansion is particularly present in higher-order cognitive regions of the ventral prefrontal cortex and supports the “last-in-first-out” hypothesis for brain maturation in recent evolutionary development of human faculties.",Sam Vickery;Kaustubh R.
