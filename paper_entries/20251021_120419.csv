10.1088/1748-9326/ae0ae7,False,Environmental Research Letters,该论文主要研究当前气候条件下，中国东南地区前所未有的夏季季风降雨的风险和动态。它使用气候模型模拟来评估极端降雨事件的概率，并探讨与这些事件相关的环流动力学机制，例如西太平洋副热带高压（WPSH）和急流的变化。该研究侧重于气候预测和气象分析，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关联。,"['extreme rainfall', 'climate model simulations', 'Asian summer monsoon', 'western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH)', 'jet stream dynamics']",Ka Ho Cheung;Man Nam Wong;Ronald Kwan Kit Li;Francis Tam;Adam A Scaife;Nick Dunstone,The risk and dynamics of unprecedented summer monsoon rainfall over Southeast China under the current climate,"Under the influence of Asian summer monsoon, extremely heavy summer rainfall could occur in Southeast China, causing catastrophic social-economic impacts to the region. However, due to limited historical records, it is difficult to anticipate the risks of unprecedented extreme rainfall episodes. In this study the UNSEEN method (UNprecedented Simulated Extremes using ENsembles) is applied for studying these events, by sampling large ensemble climate model simulations of Version 6 of the Met Office Global Seasonal Forecasting System (GloSea6). We first perform fidelity tests on gridboxes in Southeast China and show that the climate model can represent observations realistically. Probabilities of unprecedented Southeast China rainfall are then computed for each of the five gridboxes within Southeast China, revealing probabilities of about 6% (up to 9%) in summer. The circulation dynamics associated with such events is also examined. For gridboxes close to the western north Pacific, a strengthened western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) leads to anomalous low-level southerlies onshore to Southeast China, thereby contributing to heavy rainfall there. For gridboxes along 35° N, unprecedented events are often associated with an upper-level stationary wave pattern along the climatological jet, inducing vertical motion conducive to convection. For gridboxes along 25° N, extreme rainfall events are often associated with a southward shifted subtropical jet. Finally, the importance of the shifted jet and the WPSH strength in generating the unprecedented rainfall in the southern gridboxes along 25° N is also investigated. A southward-shifted jet could lead to extreme rainfall in the southern gridboxes even when the WPSH displacement is not strong. Overall, anomalous upper-level flow and WPSH activity can be equally important in triggering unprecedented summer rainfall in Southeast China. In short, we demonstrate that the UNSEEN method can be applied for estimating the risk of extreme monsoon rainfall in Southeast China and understanding the associated mechanisms."

However, leakage accounting for these practices often relies on limited analysis and ad hoc reasoning, leading to integrity concerns and underinvestment in CSF. This study proposes a data-intensive, dynamic economic-ecological modeling approach to estimating regional CSF leakage, with global applicability. Results show how leakage varies by CSF activity, location, forest type, timeframe, and implementation rate. Critically, we show that widely cited harvest leakage estimates ignore complex forest dynamics and are a poor proxy for the metric most applicable to CSF implementation: carbon leakage. While harvest leakage is nearly always positive, our results demonstrate that some project designs can result in beneficial carbon spillovers, or negative carbon leakage. These results improve the evidence base for robust leakage quantification in CSF-based projects, enabling more accurate accounting and thereby ensuring credible climate benefits. These results are relevant in a carbon markets context, where robust leakage accounting would help safeguard the credibility of ecosystem service payments, but are also applicable to traditional, non-carbon markets conservation projects seeking to quantify carbon mitigation impacts."

Here we develop a methodology to trace these compounds throughout the environment using a stringent concept to describe their fate consistently and comprehensively. Using an individual country as the system scale, the individual flows of reactive nitrogen compounds are characterized between and within eight pools reflecting human society, economic sectors and environmental spheres, also accounting for transboundary flows, to create a national nitrogen budget. The methodology has been devised for implementation by national agencies in conjunction with greenhouse gas or air pollution emission inventories, hence it links closely with the structures and data derived in these contexts. The guiding methodological principle is the mass conservation of reactive nitrogen, implemented as a material flow analysis that systematically describes all flows and stock changes. Embedding results obtained from five European countries demonstrates the feasibility of the approach. The major environmental pathways of reactive nitrogen compounds can be traced from industrial processes and agricultural production, including the agri-food chain, indicating levers for policy interventions. Spatial and temporal benchmarking of the results demonstrates comparisons between countries or over time. While further results of practical implementation are needed to assess overall robustness, the budget approach allows for multiple opportunities of data checks and verification to visualize the uncertainty associated to many input data, such as lacking information on nitrogen contents and specific flows, or the relevance of so-far unaccounted-for stocks of reactive nitrogen. Useful applications have been identified that link nitrogen budgets to impacts on human health as well as on ecosystems and the climate, indicating that developing and using national nitrogen budgets may shape improved and information-led policies."

This study employs models contributing at least ten ensemble members to the Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project—MIROC6 and CanESM5—to examine the mid-century response of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer monsoons to changes in aerosol burdens. We focus on a scenario characterized by an increase in aerosol burdens over South Asia, but strong reductions over the NH extra-tropics, since this is consistent with observed trends. These anomalous reductions induce an inter-hemispheric energy imbalance, prompting a large-scale response in the atmospheric meridional overturning circulation. The upper-tropospheric levels of the overturning circulation enhance heat transport towards the Southern Hemisphere, while the lower levels bring enhanced moisture convergence into the NH, leading to more rainfall across NH monsoon regions. Our findings highlight that global air pollution control measures may have wide-ranging impacts well beyond the aerosol source regions. For South Asia, these findings suggest that widespread remote aerosol reductions could offset the precipitation suppression from rising local aerosol pollution."

We find that changes in transport patterns are the dominant factor in the overall ozone–ENSO responses, with the opposing effects of chemical depletion and increased biomass burning on ozone largely offsetting each other. Models consistently project an increase in tropical ozone–ENSO response associated with strengthening anomalous circulation and more abundant water vapor with global warming. 
 The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) modulates tropospheric ozone variability, yet quantitative contributions from individual processes and future response remain unclear. Here, we evaluate the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model and 10 chemistry–climate models (CCMs) in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) in capturing ozone–ENSO response, quantify the roles of transport, chemistry, and biomass burning, and examine the future evolution of these responses. The GEOS-Chem simulation over 2005–2020 well reproduces the satellite-observed ozone–ENSO response, including the instantaneous decrease (increase) in tropospheric column ozone (TCO) over the tropical eastern (western) Pacific in El Niño, and the delayed response in subtropics and mid-latitudes. The combined effects of transport, chemistry, and biomass burning emissions explain over 90 % of the simulated TCO variability in the tropical Pacific during ENSO. Changes in transport patterns show the dominant role by explaining 53 % (+0.8 DU) and 92 % (−2.2 DU) of the variability in TCO,  respectively, in the western and eastern Pacific during El Niño relative to normal periods. Chemical depletion reduces ozone by 0.2 and 0.7 DU, respectively, in the western and eastern Pacific, which is offset by enhanced biomass burning emissions of 0.4 and 0.1 DU. Only 5 out of the 10 CMIP6 CCMs, with interactive tropospheric chemistry and accurate representation of ENSO dynamics, reproduce the tropical ozone–ENSO response. These models consistently indicate that tropical ozone–ENSO response will increase by 15 %–40 % in 2100 under the SSP3-7.0 scenario, associated with strengthening anomalous circulation and increasing water vapor with global warming. These results are critical for understanding climate–chemistry interactions and for future ozone projection."

Knopf;Sandro Dahlke;Johannes Bühl;Holger Baars;Patric Seifert;Ulla Wandinger,MOSAiC studies of long-lasting mixed-phase cloud events and analysis of the liquid-phase properties of Arctic clouds,"We studied the water and ice phases of Arctic mixed-phase clouds (MPCs) using dual FOV polarization lidar and Doppler radar on board Polarstern during the MOSAiC expedition. Two long-lasting Arctic MPCs and year-round statistics show persistent droplet activation and dominant immersion freezing, indicating well-filled cloud condensation nuclei and ice-nucleating particle reservoirs. These findings help explain MPC longevity and may improve cloud life cycle representation in weather and climate models. 
 Vertically resolved observations of the temporal evolution of mixed-phase clouds (MPCs) were performed over the central Arctic during the MOSAiC (Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate) expedition, which lasted from October 2019 to September 2020. The research icebreaker Polarstern, drifting with the pack ice for more than 7 months, mostly at latitudes > 85° N, served as a platform for state-of-the-art remote sensing of aerosols and clouds. The use of the recently introduced dual field-of-view (FOV) polarization lidar technique in combination with the well-established lidar-radar retrieval technique provided, for the first time, a robust instrumental basis to monitor the evolution of the liquid and the ice phase of MPCs and the interplay between the two phases. Two long-lasting Arctic MPC events observed close to the North Pole in mid-winter (December 2019) and late summer (September 2020) are discussed to provide new insight into Arctic MPC evolution processes. In the second part of the article, cloud statistics, covering all seasons of a year, are presented. The focus is on the optical and microphysical properties of the liquid phase. These results are solely derived from the dual-FOV lidar observations. The key findings of the study can be summarized as follows: persistent activation of aerosol particles to form water droplets is of great importance for the longevity of MPCs. The observations confirm that ice formation occurs predominantly via immersion freezing. The field studies suggest that the free tropospheric reservoirs of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) were always well filled, i.e., the clouds did not exhaust their supply of activatable and activated particles. The observation of long-lasting MPC events, low ice production rates, and a sufficiently large INP reservoir leads to the recommendation to use a time-dependent immersion freezing parameterization in MPC modeling efforts."

The rise in Pb and Zn concentrations during lockdowns was primarily linked to sustained coal combustion and non-ferrous smelting activities. The reduced emissions of Pb and As during the lockdown period yielded the greatest health benefits. Targeting fossil fuel combustion should be prioritized in Pb and As mitigation strategies. 
 Airborne hazardous trace metals pose significant risks to human health. However, the response characteristics of ambient trace metals to emission reductions remain poorly understood. The COVID-19 pandemic offered a unique opportunity to investigate these response mechanisms and optimize emission control strategies. In this study, we employed the Global Modeling System for Chemistry (GEOS-Chem) chemical transport model to predict global variations in atmospheric concentrations of nine hazardous trace metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn) and assess their responses to COVID-19 lockdown measures. Our results revealed that global average concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, and V decreased by 1 %–7 %, whereas Pb and Zn levels increased by 0.4 % and 2 %, respectively. The rise in Pb and Zn concentrations during lockdowns was primarily linked to sustained coal combustion and non-ferrous smelting activities, which remained essential for residential energy demands. Spatially, India, Western Europe (WE), and North America (NA) experienced the most pronounced declines in trace metal levels, while Sub-Saharan Africa (SS) and Australia showed minimal sensitivity to lockdown-induced emission reductions. Based on the scenario analysis, we found the concentrations of trace metals displayed linear response to emission reduction. Combined with the health risk assessment, we demonstrated the reduced emissions of Pb and As during the lockdown period yielded the greatest health benefits – Pb reductions were associated with lower non-carcinogenic risks, while As declines contributed most significantly to reduced carcinogenic risks. Targeting fossil fuel combustion should be prioritized in Pb and As mitigation strategies."

Our approach relies on a data assimilation technique that integrates various physical sea level observations and predictions. A prominent feature in our reconstruction is that it provides an ensemble of 35 complete time series at sites of tide gauge, which allows for direct statistical assessment. The average of our reconstructed global mean sea level shows strong agreements with other reconstructions. 
 Tide gauges record sea level changes along coastlines. They are widely used to determine the twentieth century global mean sea level (GMSL) rise. However, a major issue in tide gauge data is the presence of various, substantial, and sometimes persistent data gaps, which hinder our understanding of sea level rise, especially at regional and local scales. Whilst the GMSL reconstructions have been provided by several influential studies, reconstructions at the exact sites of tide gauges are rarely available. Here, we present sea level reconstructions at global 945 tide gauges, covering the period from 1900 to 2022. Our approach relies on a data assimilation technique that integrates various physical sea level observations and predictions, including sea level simulations from 35 climate models. A prominent feature in our reconstruction is that it provides an ensemble of 35 reconstructions at each site of tide gauge, providing continuous and refined sea level time series. This ensemble reconstruction allows for direct statistical assessments, e.g., average, median, spread, and percentile. The average of reconstructed sea level across 945 tide gauges reveals a GMSL rate of 1.75 ± 0.05 mm yr−1 over 1900–2020, and shows strong agreement with other GMSL reconstructions for both the curves of time series and overall trends. At local scale, our reconstructions are comparable to an independent reconstruction. Despite some rate differences at certain locations, the reconstructed sea level trends closely follow the raw records when they are available, emphasizing the importance of the observations at tide gauges. Our sea level reconstructions offer a valuable resource for improving global and regional sea level projections, validating climate model performance, and informing coastal adaptation strategies through understanding the sea level rise over the past century. The reconstructed sea level is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15385035 (Mu, 2025)."

Carracedo;Marta Álvarez;Pascale Lherminier;Antón Velo,Two decades of pHT measurements along the GO-SHIP A25 section,"Ocean acidification threatens marine ecosystems and the climate, and is typically measured by ocean pH. This study provides a new, twenty-year dataset of pH measurements from the North Atlantic, resulting from the correction and reevaluation of historical and recent pH measurements that had methodological-derived bias. This revised dataset supports accurate reassessment of pH trends and carbon variables, under novel and updated methodological standards. 
 The North Atlantic (NA) GO-SHIP A25 OVIDE-BOCATS section is a long-term repeat hydrographic transect extending from Portugal to Greenland. Since 2002, physical and biogeochemical measurements have been carried out biennially along the OVIDE-BOCATS section, contributing to a better understanding of water mass properties, mixing, circulation, carbon storage, and climate change impacts such as ocean acidification (OA) in the NA. In particular, the high-precision pH measurements on the total hydrogen ion scale (pHT) from the OVIDE-BOCATS program represent a key milestone in monitoring OA in this particularly climate sensitive region. The method used for pHT determination relies on adding meta-cresol purple (mCP) dye to the seawater sample and spectrophotometrically measuring its absorbances at specific wavelengths. The OVIDE-BOCATS program has used unpurified mCP dye, which impurities have been proven to bias pHT values. Here we quantified the bias induced by these impurities in pHT measurements. We found that measurements carried out using the unpurified mCP dye tend to be, on average, 0.011 ± 0.002 pHT units higher than those obtained using the purified mCP dye, with this difference slightly decreasing at higher pHT values. Moreover, we tested independent methods to correct the effect of impurities in both the historical and recent OVIDE-BOCATS pHT data, demonstrating that the correction is consistent across methods. The long-term pHT dataset has been updated to include newly acquired data and absorbance measurements, and to standardize corrections for mCP dye impurities. This effort results in a twenty-year dataset of pHT corrected for mCP dye impurities, that demonstrates the possibility of a global effort to improve the reliability and coherency of spectrophotometric pHT measurements made with unpurified mCP dye. The corrections applied to our pHT dataset have negligible implications for the OA rates previously reported, but they do affect the depth of the aragonite saturation horizon, implying a shoaling of approximately 150 m."

We produced a satellite-based ice fraction dataset for small water bodies on the Arctic Coastal Plain from 2017 to 2023. The dataset captures freeze-up and break-up timing and reveals spatial variability. It will support studies of climate–ice interactions and improve models of water and carbon processes. 
 Ice cover of water bodies in the northern high latitudes (NHL) is highly sensitive to the changing climate, and its dynamics exert substantial impacts on the NHL ecosystems, hydrological processes, and the carbon cycle. Yet, operational quantification of ice cover dynamics for smaller water bodies (e.g., ≤ 25 km²) over vast, remote NHL regions remains limited. Here, we developed an ice fraction dataset for small water bodies (900 m² to 25 km²) across the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska (ACP) from 2017 through 2023, using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, texture features, and Daymet air temperature data. The dataset has a spatial resolution of 1 km and a temporal resolution of approximately 6 days. Compared with the Google Dynamic World (DW) product derived from Sentinel-2 optical remote sensing, our dataset shows high consistency with DW (R = 0.91, RMSE = 0.19) while having enhanced temporal coverage due to less SAR constraints from solar illumination, cloud cover, and atmospheric conditions. Validation against in-situ observations suggests that our dataset is more capable of capturing small water body ice phenology (e.g., freeze-up and break-up dates) relative to DW, with an 11-day reduction in mean absolute error. Our ice fraction dataset reveals high spatial heterogeneity in ice conditions mainly occurring in June for small water bodies across the ACP. The ice phenology analysis over three selected subregions further shows that a warmer transition period generally leads to earlier ice break-up and later freeze-up, while the responses of ice fraction to warming climate vary among and within individual water bodies. The resulting dataset is anticipated to fill a gap in ice phenology studies for small water bodies, improve our understanding on the interactions between ice dynamics and climate change, and enhance the coupled modelling of ice and carbon processes.

Many compounds were both emitted and absorbed depending on the season and time of day. Emissions peaked in summer, while uptake was stronger in autumn. This unique long-term dataset improves our understanding of forest–atmosphere interactions and supports better air quality and climate models. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and ozone (O3) are key constituents of tropospheric chemistry, affecting both air quality and climate. Forests are major emitters of biogenic VOCs (BVOCs), yet large uncertainties remain regarding the diversity of exchanged compounds, the drivers of their bidirectional fluxes, and their in-canopy chemistry. Long-term and comprehensive in situ datasets remain scarce, limiting our understanding of these complex processes. We conducted a three-year field campaign (2022–2024) at the Integrated Carbon Observation System forest station of Vielsalm (BE-Vie), combining vertical concentration profile and eddy covariance flux measurements above and below the canopy. Using a PTR-ToF-MS and a dedicated open-source processing pipeline, we identified 51 significantly exchanged VOCs. The vertical and diurnal gradients of the mixing ratios reflected the interplay between emission, deposition, chemistry, and transport. Combined with a profile of turbulence statistics, these observations offer an opportunity to investigate their behaviour within the canopy. The forest acted as a net VOC source in summer (∼ 1.25 μg m−2 s−1), while deposition dominated in autumn. Many oxygenated VOCs displayed bidirectional exchange. Monoterpenes, isoprene, and methanol were the most abundant flux contributors, but 15–30 (30–43) compounds were needed to account for 90 % of total emissions (depositions), depending on the season. Below-canopy BVOC and O3 fluxes reached ∼ 10 % of above-canopy ones, with proportionally enhanced below-canopy ozone uptake at night. This study provides one of the most detailed long-term datasets of VOC and O3 exchange in a temperate forest and serves as a key reference for improving process-based models of biogenic, physical, and chemical exchange in forest ecosystems."

We created the first long-term record of these glaciers and their lakes from 1990 to 2022 by analyzing satellite images. Our results show that many glaciers are shrinking while their lakes are growing. These changes matter because they affect water supply, flood risks, and mountain landscapes. This dataset offers new knowledge to support research and planning for climate change impacts. 
 Lake-terminating glaciers (LTGs) typically exhibit higher rates of retreat and thinning compared to land-terminating glaciers. However, a comprehensive inventory for LTGs and their associate proglacial lakes across High Mountain Asia (HMA) is currently lacking, limiting further understanding of their spatial heterogeneity in glacier change. This study employs a semi-automated identification method, coupled with rigorous visual inspection, to construct a comprehensive inventory of LTGs and proglacial lakes in HMA for 1990 and 2022.

During the past 32 year, the total area of proglacial lakes increased by 138.19 ± 1.18 km² (81.7 %), alongside a glacier area loss of 324.43 ± 19.23 km² (5.1 %).

Natali,ABCFlux v2: Arctic–boreal CO2 and CH4 monthly flux observations and ancillary information across terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems,"This dataset includes monthly measurements of carbon dioxide and methane exchange between land, water, and the atmosphere from over 1,000 sites in Arctic and boreal regions. It combines measurements from a variety of ecosystems, including wetlands, forests, tundra, lakes, and rivers, gathered by over 260 researchers from 1984–2024. This dataset can be used to improve and reduce uncertainty in carbon budgets in order to strengthen our understanding of climate feedbacks in a warming world. 
 Measurements of surface-atmosphere carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes have been relatively sparse across the Arctic tundra and boreal biomes, causing significant uncertainties in carbon budget estimates from the region. While the availability of Arctic-boreal carbon flux data has increased substantially over the past decade, the data have remained spread across different repositories, scientific articles, and unpublished sources, making it difficult to leverage. Here we present a new dataset of monthly Arctic-boreal carbon fluxes (ABCFlux v2) across terrestrial (wetlands and uplands) and freshwater (lakes and rivers) ecosystems compiled from previous syntheses including the Arctic-boreal CO2 flux database (ABCFlux v1), the Boreal-Arctic Wetland and Lake Methane Dataset (BAWLD-CH4), and the Global River Methane Database (GRiMeDB). In addition, we consider data from general-purpose (e.g., Zenodo) and flux network repositories, literature, and site principal investigators. The dataset includes surface-atmosphere CO2 fluxes of gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (Reco), and net ecosystem exchange (NEE), alongside CH4 fluxes. For aquatic ecosystems, we split CH4 fluxes into diffusive and ebullitive flux pathways, and included potential emissions from transient storage in the water column (“storage fluxes”), alongside CO2 and CH4 concentrations dissolved in the surface water. Fluxes are measured through a variety of methods including chamber and eddy covariance techniques alongside bubble traps, ice-surveys, and concentration-based turbulence-driven modelling in aquatic ecosystems. The monthly flux data are reported together with supporting methodological and environmental metadata. The resulting ABCFlux v2 has 23,656 flux site-months, 8,182 concentration site-months, and 199 seasonal observations from 1,024 sites, and includes 55,560 reported fluxes (i.e. sum of GPP, Reco, NEE, and CH4 fluxes) from the years 1984 to 2024. The majority of monthly observations occurred after 1999. Wetlands had the highest number of site-month observations (8,641), followed by boreal forest (6,981), lotic ecosystems (6,275), lentic ecosystems (3,725) and upland tundra (3,308). Measurements of CO2 dominated the dataset across most ecosystem types (25,101) except for lentic ecosystems, where CH4 flux site-months (3,024) were more frequent than CO2 flux site-months (2,858). Overall, ABCFlux v2 includes 158 % more site-months for terrestrial CO2 flux data compared to ABCFlux v1. Integrating and updating BAWLD-CH4 flux data from growing season averages to monthly fluxes resulted in 5,671 site-months of chamber CH4 data compared to 762 site-years. This collaborative initiative, involving contributions from over 260 researchers, provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the Arctic-boreal carbon flux network and its data, and serves as an important step in reducing uncertainties in Arctic-boreal carbon budgets and in enhancing our understanding of climate feedbacks.

New spatial verification metrics like the Fraction Skill Score (FSS) perform better but are difficult to use in a global domain due to large computational cost. We introduce two new global smoothing methodologies that can be used with smoothing-based metrics in a global domain. We demonstrate their effectiveness with an analysis of global precipitation forecasts. 
 Forecast verification plays a crucial role in the development cycle of operational numerical weather prediction models. At the same time, verification remains a challenge as the traditionally used non-spatial forecast quality metrics exhibit certain drawbacks, with new spatial metrics being developed to address these problems. Some of these new metrics are based on smoothing, with one example being the widely used Fraction Skill Score (FSS) and its many derivatives. However, while the FSS has been used by many researchers in limited area domains, there are no examples of it being used in a global domain yet. The issue is due to the increased computational complexity of smoothing in a global domain, with its inherent spherical geometry and non-equidistant and/or irregular grids. At the same time, there clearly exists a need for spatial metrics that could be used in the global domain as the operational global models continue to be developed and improved, along with the new machine-learning-based models. Here, we present two new methodologies for smoothing in a global domain that are potentially fast enough to make the smoothing of high-resolution global fields feasible. Both approaches also consider the variability of grid point area sizes and can handle missing data appropriately. This, in turn, makes the calculation of smoothing-based metrics, such as FSS and its derivatives, in a global domain possible, which we demonstrate by evaluating the performance of operational high-resolution global precipitation forecasts provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts."

However, our understandings of the ASC variability and its driving mechanisms remain limited due to observational constraints in the Antarctic region. This study investigates the seasonal variability of the ASC in the Cosmonaut Sea, East Antarctica, focusing on the observed spring weakening of the ASC and its underlying mechanisms. The spring weakening of the ASC is shown to be linked to reduced wind‐driven poleward Ekman transport, which induces a seesaw shift in sea surface height and a subsequent adjustment in the isopycnal structure across the continental slope. Our findings emphasize the importance of understanding the dynamical processes modulating the ASC's strength for assessing future Antarctic ice sheet mass loss and its contribution to global sea level rise."

While waves ranging from below the ion cyclotron frequency to above the electron plasma frequency are commonly observed near reconnection sites, electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves—frequent in other plasma environments—have been rarely observed in the reconnection region. Here, we report the first detection of EMIC waves in a magnetic reconnection exhaust at Earth's magnetopause. The free energy required for EMIC wave growth was supplied by the strong perpendicular‐to‐parallel temperature anisotropy of hot proton beams. This proton temperature anisotropy was generated by magnetopause reconnection, rather than inherited from the magnetosheath. Our findings differ from previous reports of parallel‐preferential proton heating during magnetopause reconnection, calling for revised theoretical frameworks to reconcile observed perpendicular‐preferential heating with established reconnection paradigms."

Higher‐resolution models outperform coarser‐resolution models in intensity prediction but perform similarly for outer size regardless of resolution. Notably, the initial storm outer size may significantly influence the outer size forecast: initially larger storms may present greater challenges for accurate size prediction.

Here, we analyze the centennial‐ to millennial‐scale isotope variability of the Greenland ice cores NGRIP, GRIP, and GISP2 to investigate how their coherent signal and local noise have evolved over the last 100,000 years. We show that the noise systematically depends on the climate state, with higher levels under colder temperatures and lower accumulation rates. Most of the noise originates from local stratigraphic disturbances, while additional noise variability only emerges in the Greenland stadials. The remaining climate signal variability is higher in the last glacial period compared to the Holocene, but does not systematically differ between stadials and interstadials. We show that, by considering systematic changes of noise, it is possible to achieve more accurate estimates of past climate variability."

Here, we explicitly present a series of nanoscale 3‐D plastic wear processes of α‐quartz asperities by using molecular dynamics method, where asperity climbing mode dominates during the sliding. We identify a transition from atom‐by‐atom wear damage to layer removal of α‐quartz asperities with increasing normal forces. Moreover, nanoscale wear volume evolution depends on the normal force and loading velocity and shows sublinear increase with loading distance.

Results show these events are rare but possible. The most robust association we find is between a negative Southern Annular Mode transition and extreme Antarctic sea ice loss.

Autocorrelation and natural migration profiles reveal a ∼3‐km‐wide fracture zone (WFZ), which we interpret as a legacy of long‐term slip on the NAF. The low Vs and structural complexity suggest the WFZ functions as a soft barrier. Hence, it could have contributed to arrest rupture propagation during the 1999 M7.6 Izmit earthquake, as well as partitioning stress between fault segments.

We found that areas with higher climate heterogeneity support greater vegetation adaptability and migration potential in response to changing climate conditions. Including climate heterogeneity in species distribution models clearly confirmed that climate heterogeneity promotes vegetation migration. Our results show that while rising temperatures generally limit vegetation migration, climate heterogeneity can help offset this effect by offering climatic refugia and expanding suitable habitat ranges.

However, the seasonality of sulfate aerosols over NATL has decreased since 1970, likely due to a reduction in the United States (US) SO2 emissions following the Clean Air Act of 1970. We performed atmospheric chemistry and transport simulations to assess the impact of changing US SO2 emissions between 1970 and 2010 on NATL sulfate burden and radiative forcing. United States SO2 emission reductions weakened the seasonality in NATL sulfate burden by ∼17%, primarily due to a decrease in chemical production and transport in summer. These emission reductions caused a summertime radiative forcing (∼2 W m−2) twice as large as the wintertime forcing. Our findings highlight the complex, season‐dependent responses of sulfate burden and radiative effects to regional emission changes."

Here we identify synoptic origins (referring to large‐scale weather patterns and the associated rainfall processes) of extreme floods by analyzing a large catalog of flood‐producing storms over the North China Plain. The most extreme floods are associated with a northward and westward extension of the Subtropical High, providing favorable synoptic conditions for predecessor rainfall processes, despite their relatively low frequency of occurrence. Low‐level moisture convergence modulated by both regional topography and synoptic forcing dictates the spatiotemporal variability of extreme rainfall. We reveal a critical dependence of basin‐scale flood controls on synoptic origins of extreme floods. Our analysis provides process‐driven insights into the tail behavior of flood peaks that can inform flood risk management."

Our new records from the Russian Far East, spanning 9–5 ka BP, fill this spatial gap and reveal a synchronous δ18O negative excursion and intensified monsoon precipitation between 8 and 9 ka BP, contrasting with trends in North China. We suggest this difference may stem from changes in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation (NHSI) over the Holocene. The NHSI decrease since early Holocene weakens southwesterly winds and the Western Pacific Subtropical High, shifting the westerly jet and rainbelt southward. This causes reduced (increased) precipitation in North China (Northeast Asia), as well as reduced (increased) contribution of Pacific Ocean moisture to North China (Northeast Asia), resulting in δ18O increase (decrease) in North China (Northeast Asia)."

Their presence in the Triassic, alongside unrelated calcifying organisms, suggests a diversification of marine calcifying organisms after the end-Permian mass extinction. 
 Over geologic time, biocalcification – the process by which marine organisms make calcium carbonate (CaCO3) – has reshaped climates, ocean life, and seawater chemistry. In particular, the evolution of coccolithophores, the largest group of nannoplankton and today’s most productive calcifiers, transformed ocean environments and the carbon cycle. Their origins, however, remain enigmatic. This is partly because studying coccolithophore fossils traditionally requires CaCO3 preservation. Here, we bypass this limitation, searching for their ‘ghost’ fossils –imprints on organic matter. We present coccolithophores from ~241-million-year-old (Triassic) rocks, predating previous records by ~26 million years (myrs). The >100 ghost fossils, exceptionally preserved within zooplankton faeces, show that coccolithophores, nannoplankton, ‘modern’ eukaryotic phytoplankton, and planktonic biocalcification evolved earlier than previously thought. Coccolithophores now first appear alongside stony corals and other unrelated calcifiers, suggesting a diversification of a range of marine calcifying organisms following Earth’s deadliest mass extinction, the end-Permian event. These findings indicate that coccolithophore diversity remained remarkably low for ~50 myrs, until after the end-Triassic mass extinction, showing that both Triassic-bookending extinctions were critical in their evolution. Our discoveries elucidate the evolutionary origins of coccolithophores, but also highlight the role mass extinctions have played in shaping life on Earth.

The authors develop a fluorinated polymer electrolyte with tailored Li–F/O coordination that decouples ion conduction from polymer relaxation, enabling stable Li metal cell operation from −50 to 70 °C. 
 Polymer-based solid-state batteries operable across broad temperatures are critical for advanced energy storage but face limitations from sluggish ion transport kinetics in polymer electrolytes. Here, we develop a fluorinated quasi-solid polymer electrolyte that balances weak Li⁺-polymer interactions with efficient salt dissociation. This electrolyte was fabricated by in situ polymerization of 2,2,3,4,4,4-hexafluorobutyl acrylate. The incorporation of -CF2- groups within 2,2,3,4,4,4-hexafluorobutyl acrylate promotes the formation a fluorine-oxygen co-coordination structure that decouples ion conduction from polymer relaxation. This mechanism creates more efficient Li⁺ transport pathways along polymer chains and surrounding solvent molecules, promoting uniform Li⁺ flux at the Li metal electrode interface. Consequently, the electrolyte exhibits 0.27 mS cm−1 conductivity at −40 °C, enabling 10 C rates and operation from −50 to 70 °C in Li | |LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells.

Here, authors use these sequences in a proteomic search method called “signal strapping” to discover metalloproteins, which have an N-terminal histidine that chelates a transition metal ion. 
 Metalloprotein discovery is often made post hoc, in which activity studies following protein isolation reveal a metal-ion dependence. Herein we take a different approach to finding metalloproteins, by building on the discovery of copper-containing lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs), which include an N-terminal histidine as part of their sequence. This residue acts as a natural chelator for transition metal ions, irrespective of the structure of the protein. We report the method of signal strapping, where sequences of N-terminal signal peptides artificially appended with a histidine residue at their C-terminus are used to bootstrap a proteomic search. These searches return sequences of proteins with an N-terminal histidine capable of coordinating a metal ion. We exemplify the approach by the discovery and characterisation of four classes of bacterial metalloproteins, including two that we denote as anglerases reflecting their potential to capture transition metal ions from the bacterial environment. Signal peptide sequences appear in secreted proteins.

 A common mechanism by which cancer cells acquire resistance to chemotherapeutics is through the overexpression of efflux pumps, enabling the removal of cytotoxic agents, such as anthracycline drugs. However, platinum anticancer agents that crosslink DNA and interact with proteins are poor efflux pump substrates. Here, we design dual warhead drug conjugates by tethering a platinum pharmacophore to the doxorubicin backbone. These drug conjugates retain the anticancer activity of anthracyclines and exhibit the ability to both circumvent drug efflux and delay the acquisition of drug resistance. In vivo experiments demonstrate that such drug conjugates extend survival in a preclinical organoid-based model of metastatic colon cancer in mice. Mechanistic studies indicate that these drug conjugates overcome resistance through covalent platinum-protein interactions, leading to significantly improved drug retention and alteration of subcellular drug distribution. This application of platinum offers many opportunities to confront issues related to chemoresistance and alternative pathways for augmenting conventional chemotherapeutics.

Evolutionary molecular dynamics (Evo-MD) simulations—genetic algorithms guided by (coarse-grained) molecular force-fields–reveal that thermodynamic optimal cholesterol attraction in isolated alpha-helical transmembrane domains occurs when multiple consecutive lysine/arginine residues flank a short hydrophobic segment. These findings are supported by atomistic simulations and solid-state NMR experiments. Our analyses illustrate that linear motifs in transmembrane domains exhibit weak binding affinity for cholesterol, characterized by sub-microsecond residence times, challenging the predictive value of linear CRAC/CARC motifs for cholesterol binding. Membrane protein database analyses suggest even weaker affinity for native linear motifs, whereas live cell assays demonstrate that optimizing cholesterol binding restricts transmembrane domains to the endoplasmic reticulum post-translationally. In summary, these findings contribute to our understanding of cholesterol-protein interactions and offer insight into the mechanisms of protein-mediated cholesterol regulation within membranes. Cholesterol plays a key role in membrane biology. Here, authors employ evolutionary molecular dynamics simulations to explore interactions driven by linear protein sequences, challenging the predictive power of traditional cholesterol-binding motifs."

With spatially explicit data, researchers show how the so-called carbon hoofprint varies between cities due to the different carbon intensities of producing regions. 
 Meat consumed in cities is largely produced in rural regions. Supply chain opacity and complexity hinder understanding of (and the ability to address) the distributed impacts of urban meat consumption on rural communities and environments. Here we combine supply chain models with spatial carbon accounting to quantify and map the GHG emissions from beef, chicken and pork consumption—the carbon hoofprint—for all 3,531 cities in the contiguous USA. This carbon hoofprint totals 329 MtCO2e, equivalent to emissions from US at-home fossil fuel combustion. Surprising differences in the carbon intensity of meat-producing regions explain variation in per capita hoofprints between cities (500–1,731 kgCO2e). Demand-side measures such as reducing food waste and dietary shifts (for example, more chicken, less beef) could halve emissions. Our modelling highlights reduction strategies across the supply chain and provides a basis to address the transboundary impacts of cities.

Here the authors present an Earth-abundant manganese oxide electrocatalyst that is resilient to voltage fluctuations and maintains oxygen evolution reaction activities for 2,000 h. 
 Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, fluctuate on timescales of seconds to hours. Harnessing such intermittent energy to drive chemical synthesis represents a major challenge, as conventional 3d-block metal catalysts are prone to degradation even under small variations in operating potential. Here we report an electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction system that is tolerant to voltage fluctuations through the design of catalytic pathways. By leveraging the redox chemistry of manganese oxide, we integrated the Guyard reaction (4Mn2+ + Mn7+ → 5Mn3+) as a regeneration pathway into the catalytic cycle. Unlike other 3d-block metal catalysts, which rapidly degrade under fluctuating conditions, the constructed manganese oxide system shows resilience to voltage fluctuations by alternating between decomposition and regeneration. When the voltage is switched between 1.68 and 3.00 V repeatedly, the catalyst can maintain an oxygen evolution reaction at pH 2 for more than 2,000 h, highlighting the importance of pathway design for sustainable energy conversion from intermittent renewable sources.

 With climate change-induced sea ice decline in the Arctic Ocean, nitrogen is expected to become an increasingly important determinant of primary productivity. Nitrogen fixation is the conversion of molecular nitrogen to bioavailable ammonium by microorganisms called diazotrophs. Here, we report nitrogen fixation rates, diazotroph composition, and expression under different stages of declining sea ice in the Central Arctic Ocean (multiyear ice, five stations) and the Eurasian Arctic (marginal ice zone, seven stations). Nitrogen fixation in the Central Arctic Ocean was positively correlated with primary production, ranging from 0.4 ± 0.1 to 2.5 ± 0.87 nmol N L−1 d−1. Along two transects across the marginal ice zone, nitrogen fixation varied between days and ice regime from below detection up to 5.3 ± 3.65 nmol N L−1 d−1 associated with an ice-edge phytoplankton bloom. We show nitrogen fixation in sea ice-covered waters of the Arctic Ocean and provide insight into present and active non-cyanobacterial diazotrophs in the region.

 Giant magnetofossils are unusual, micron-sized biogenic magnetite particles found in sediments dating back at least 97 million years. Their distinctive morphologies are the product of biologically controlled mineralisation, yet the identity of their biomineralising organism, and the biological function they serve, remain a mystery. It is currently thought that the organism exploited magnetite’s mechanical properties for protection. Here we explore an alternative hypothesis, that it exploited magnetite’s magnetic properties for the purpose of magnetoreception. We present a three-dimensional magnetic vector tomography study of a giant magnetofossil and assess its magnetoreceptive potential. Our results reveal a single magnetic vortex that displays an optimised response to spatial variations in the intensity of Earth’s magnetic field. This magnetic trait may have conferred an evolutionary advantage to mobile marine organisms, providing an upper age limit on the development of navigational magnetoreception and raising the possibility that earlier evidence of this sense may yet be preserved in the fossil record. More broadly, this work provides a blueprint for assessing the morphological and magnetic evidence for putative biogenic iron oxide particles, which are a key component in the search for early life on Earth and Mars.

 The 1458/59 CE volcanic event, among the largest in the last millennium, is primarily attributed to the Kuwae volcano in Vanuatu. However, a recent study suggests the Reclus volcano in southern Patagonia, Chile, as an alternative source. Here, we assess the hypothesis by examining unpolished, micron-sized glass shards from the 1458/59 CE cryptotephra in the Antarctic Vostok Station firn core. Results reveal a bimodal composition of dacitic and rhyolitic shards, linked to Kuwae and Reclus, respectively. Antarctic ice core records also exhibit a two-stage pattern of ash deposition: coarse ash from nearby volcanoes followed by finer ash transported over long distances, implying concurrent eruptions. Nevertheless, discrepancies in composition between observed rhyolitic shards and existing Reclus data, combined with no recorded Reclus activity in the 1450 s, suggests the possibility of an undocumented extratropical rhyolitic source. This study underscores the value of glass shard analysis in identifying the origins of volcanic eruptions.

 Coral reefs, among the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth, face an existential threat from the increasing frequency and intensity of coral bleaching events driven by global warming. While much of the existing research examines bleaching as an isolated phenomenon, the critical threshold linking bleaching rates to long-term reef degradation remains poorly understood. Here we identified pivotal factors influencing coral bleaching rates at a global scale, leveraging a data-driven model integrating historical field observations with climate simulations across multiple emission scenarios. Our findings reveal a critical bleaching threshold of 7.9% annually, beyond which coral reef ecosystems would undergo significant degradation. Alarmingly, even under the most optimistic mitigation pathways, substantial degradation is projected across all major tropical marine regions by the end of the century. This study highlights the urgent need for bold and effective global policies to safeguard coral reef ecosystems and ensure their sustainability under an increasingly warming climate.

 H2O2-driven oxidation has been considered to be the main cause of sulfate formation in haze events. However, field observations have confirmed that the known H2O2 sources cannot explain its ambient levels. In this study, the photochemistry of acetylacetone (AA), a ubiquitous β-diketone in the atmosphere, was investigated under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation using droplets formed in-situ by deliquescence of hygroscopic ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4) and sodium dihydrogen phosphate (NaH2PO4). Special emphasis was placed on elucidating its contributions to H2O2 formation and SO2 oxidation under varying conditions. Results show that AA photolysis significantly boosted H2O2 production. In (NH4)2SO4 droplets, H2O2 peaked early after UV irradiation, while in NaH2PO4 droplets, it reached fourfold higher and peaked later because phosphate promotes the AA photolysis. Hydrogen atom donors like citric acid redirected radical termination from H2O2 to organic hydroperoxides (ROOHs). Cl− and Br− altered radical processes: Cl− suppressed H2O2 production but enhanced ROOHs production, while Br− exhibits stronger, concentration-dependent effects on both species. SO2 oxidation was achieved by various oxidizing species such as H2O2 and ROOHs produced during AA photolysis. Key products such as pyruvic acid, peroxyacetic acid and propanedioic acid were identified and possible UV-driven reaction pathways were revealed. These results uncover new H2O2 production and sulfate formation pathways, and show the complexity of aerosol-phase photochemistry. This work improves our understanding of atmospheric H2O2 source and redox processes, offering new insights for the oxidation potential of atmospheric organic aerosols and atmospheric oxidation capacity, and enhancing atmospheric chemistry models to better predict air quality and climate."

 Climate risks from compound extreme events are much greater than the sum of their sub-components. In early summer 2022, unprecedented rainstorm in South China and heatwave in North China were observed concurrently during 1979–2024 (referred to here as an SRNH event). However, most of seasonal predictions failed to capture this far-reaching SRNH event and the behind mechanisms are still unclear. The high-ranking dipole sea surface temperature anomalies in the North Atlantic (SSTNA) in February–March promoted the 2022 SRNH extreme, which was successfully verified by numerical experiments. The SSTNA, highest in the recent decade, triggered the Rossby wave train, leading to record-breaking East Asian subtropical jet stream and high-level key mid-tropospheric atmospheric circulations. An anomalous anticyclonic circulation was strengthened over the Altai Mountains and North China, causing heatwave in North China. The enhanced northeast China cold vortex stabilized the western Pacific subtropical high around 20°N. The co-occurrence of the stronger Northeast cold vortex and stable western Pacific subtropical high jointly led to the rainstorm over South China in 2022. The significantly stronger dipole SSTNA controlled wavier mid-latitude westerlies and southward west Pacific subtropical high, which jointly contributed to the 2022 SRNH extreme."
