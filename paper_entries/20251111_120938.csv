10.5194/acp-25-15369-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该论文主要研究卷云中冰晶的来源，通过比较两种冰核化方案（K22和LP05）来分析不同来源（如山脉、湍流和对流）对冰晶形成的影响。研究重点在于理解和模拟卷云中冰晶的形成过程，并评估模型结果与观测数据的符合程度。虽然该研究涉及大气过程，但它更侧重于云微物理和气候模拟，而非直接与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析）相关。,"['cirrus clouds', 'ice nucleation', 'orographic gravity waves', 'convective detrainment', 'turbulence', 'ice crystals', 'climate models', 'cloud microphysics']",Kai Lyu;Xiaohong Liu;Bernd Kärcher,Exploring sources of ice crystals in cirrus clouds: comparative analysis of two ice nucleation schemes in CAM6,"Two nucleation schemes are used to study ice nucleation, focusing on three ice sources: mountains, turbulence and anvils. Ice from mountains is concentrated in mid- and high-latitudes, while ice from turbulence and anvils is more common in low and mid-latitudes. Both schemes simulate orographic cirrus clouds, with mountain ice as the dominant source. The schemes differ in how they handle ice source competition, causing turbulence and anvils to influence clouds differently. 
 Ice crystal formation in cirrus clouds is poorly understood, and its representation remains a challenge in global climate models. To enhance the understanding, a novel ice nucleation parameterization based on the Kärcher (2022) (K22) scheme is introduced into the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model version 6 (CAM6). To investigate ice formation in cirrus clouds, sensitivity tests are conducted to analyze three ice sources from orographic gravity wave (OGWs), convective detrainment, and turbulence. These tests employ both the K22 scheme and the default Liu and Penner (2005) (LP05) scheme. Model evaluation includes 6-year climatology and nudged simulations representing the Small Particles in Cirrus (SPARTICUS) and O2 / N2 Ratio and CO2 Airborne Southern Ocean Study (ORCAS) campaigns.Both schemes simulate that convection detrained and turbulence-induced ice crystals are concentrated in low- to mid-latitudes, whereas OGW-induced ice crystals are concentrated in mid- to high latitudes. Compared to the LP05 scheme, the K22 scheme generates a higher number of ice crystals. The simulated cloud microphysical properties using the K22 scheme align well with observations for orographic cirrus during the SPARTICUS campaign. In orographic cirrus over high terrains at mid- to high latitudes, both schemes identify OGW-induced ice crystals as the dominant ice source. Due to its distinct competition parameterizations, the K22 scheme exhibits less contribution from minor ice sources (convection detrained and turbulence-induced). This underscores the significance of competition mechanisms within ice nucleation schemes and helps clarify regional and dynamical controls on ice sources in cirrus clouds. The application of two distinct nucleation schemes provides valuable insights into the dominant ice sources in cirrus clouds."

Total CH₄ emissions were 16.9 ± 5.3 t h−1, dominated by older, shallow-water platforms. Emissions were lower than inventories but 2 times larger than operator reports. Trace gas data suggest venting and fugitives as main CH₄ sources. The carbon intensity was 3.4 ± 0.8 g CO₂ eq MJ−1, with older platforms CH₄-dominated and newer deep-water sites CO₂-dominated. 
 In September 2022, the METHANE-To-Go Africa (MTGA) scientific aircraft campaign, part of UNEP's International Methane Emissions Observatory (IMEO) Methane Science Studies, conducted the first methane (CH4) emissions measurements from the offshore oil and gas sector in West Africa. Using aircraft-based mass balance methods, we quantified trace gas emissions from all 57 Angolan offshore facilities, estimating total sector emissions and assessing 30 individual sites and 10 facility groups, thereby providing the first independent dataset for this previously unstudied region. Emissions were generally consistent across repeated measurements, but two facilities showed intermittent high emissions of 10 and 4 t h−1, significantly influencing total emissions. Older, shallow-water platforms emitted more than newer, deep-water floating production facilities. These findings suggest that production volume is a poor proxy for CH4 emissions, while age and maintenance status are more reliable indicators. Due to operational variability, regular monitoring remains essential, particularly for older facilities.  We estimate total CH4 emissions at 16.9±5.3th-1, only 20 %–22 % of EDGAR and CAMS inventory estimates, but over twice the operator-reported values. Additional trace gas measurements (CO2, CO, C2H6, SO2, NOy, and aerosols) suggest CH4 stems primarily from fugitive emissions and venting, not combustion. The calculated carbon intensity of Angolan offshore oil and gas is 3.4±0.8 g CO2 eq MJ−1, with nearly equal contributions from CH4 and CO2. Notably, shallow-water platforms are CH4-dominated, while deep-water facilities mostly emit CO2. These results improve our understanding of greenhouse gas emissions from offshore production in a key oil- and gas-producing region."
10.5194/acp-25-15329-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了气溶胶（通常与空气污染有关）如何影响亚热带云层的日变化。通过高分辨率模拟，研究发现污染的云层表现出更强的日变化：夜间和早晨云层更厚，但下午消散更快。污染减少了降水但增强了干燥，加深了云层。虽然污染最初会使云层变亮，但云量的日变化略微降低了这种增亮效果。该研究分析了从秘鲁海岸到赤道的空域中，从层积云到浅积云的转变过程中，云层对气溶胶的日敏感性及其辐射特性。研究结果表明，污染条件下，云水、云量和反照率的日变化增强，夜间夹卷作用增强，降水受到抑制。云特性和向外短波辐射对液滴数浓度的总体响应呈现出明显的日变化模式：强烈的正云调整主要发生在夜间和早晨，而微弱的负调整则在下午占主导地位。这种循环是由降水抑制（增强云水和覆盖）和夹卷干燥（耗尽它们）之间的竞争驱动的。在污染条件下，增强的夹卷作用导致更深且更分离的边界层，这种边界层无法在下午被地表通量维持，从而导致负云调整。污染条件下夹卷率的提高是由于云和降水从夹卷区域的沉降减少造成的。虽然Twomey效应主导了日平均反照率响应，但竞争性云调整的日变化导致下午的净敏感性接近中性，突出了日变化过程在气溶胶-云相互作用中的关键作用。虽然该研究没有直接使用遥感技术，但它研究了气溶胶对云层的影响，而云层反照率和向外短波辐射是可以通过卫星观测到的重要参数，因此与大气环境遥感技术间接相关。,"['aerosol-cloud interactions', 'cloud radiative properties', 'diurnal cycle', 'outgoing shortwave radiation', 'cloud albedo', 'air quality (indirectly, through aerosol effects)', 'satellite observations (outgoing shortwave radiation, albedo)']",Marcin J. Kurowski;Matthew D. Lebsock;Kevin M. Smalley,The diurnal susceptibility of subtropical clouds to aerosols,"This study explores how clouds respond to pollution throughout the day using high-resolution simulations. Polluted clouds show stronger daily changes: thicker clouds at night and in the morning but faster thinning in the afternoon. Pollution reduces rainfall but enhances drying, deepening the cloud layer. While the pollution initially brightens clouds, the daily cycle of cloudiness slightly reduces this brightening effect. 
 The diurnal susceptibility of clouds and their radiative properties to aerosols is examined during their Lagrangian transition from subtropical stratocumulus to shallow cumulus regimes. Using large-eddy simulations, we analyze the six-day evolution of an air mass along a 3800 km observed trajectory from the coast of Peru toward the equator. Pristine and polluted scenarios are simulated with forcing imposed from weather reanalysis. The polluted scenario exhibits stronger diurnal variations in cloud water, cloud fraction, and albedo, with enhanced nighttime entrainment and suppressed precipitation. The overall response of cloud properties and outgoing shortwave radiation to droplet number concentration follows a distinct diurnal pattern: strong positive cloud adjustments dominate at night and in the morning, while weak negative adjustments prevail in the afternoon. This cycle is driven by the competition between precipitation suppression, which enhances cloud water and coverage, and entrainment drying, which depletes them. In polluted conditions, enhanced entrainment leads to a deeper and more decoupled boundary layer that cannot be sustained by surface fluxes in the afternoon, resulting in negative cloud adjustments. The enhanced entrainment rate under polluted conditions is caused by the reduced sedimentation of cloud and precipitation water from the entrainment zone. While the Twomey effect dominates the diurnal average albedo response, the diurnal variation in the competing cloud adjustments lead to a near-neutral net susceptibility in the afternoon, highlighting the critical role of diurnally varying processes in aerosol-cloud interactions."

Geochemical fingerprinting of April 2023 airborne dust from six deserts reveals Taklimakan/Gurbantunggut as primary sources. Alxa Plateau’s elevation (>1500 m) filters dust to Lanzhou/Mu Us, enabling recycling. Spatial variations show Lanzhou’s dust: 26 % Gurbantunggut, 18 % Taklimakan; Mu Us: 28 % Alxa, 22 % Taklimakan. Elevation barriers and sediment recycling modulate East Asian dust dynamics. 
 Northern China's arid lands constitute one of Earth's most active aeolian ecosystems, yet persistent uncertainties remain regarding the precise source apportionment of dust emissions impacting downstream regions. By applying advanced geochemical fingerprinting techniques to modern airborne dust samples collected from 11 to 29 April 2023 across major potential provenance areas (Taklimakan, Gurbantunggut, Hexi Corridor, Heihe River Basin, Alxa Plateau, and Qaidam Basin Desert), we systematically quantified dust provenance through coupled rare earth element signatures and trace element ratios. Our multivariate analysis reveals three critical findings: (1) The Taklimakan and Gurbantunggut deserts dominate as primary provenance than Alxa Plateau, Hexi Corridor and Heihe Basin and the Qaidam Basin Desert; (2) Despite the Taklimakan and Gurbantunggut Desert's upwind position relative to the CLP, the intervening Alxa Plateau (> 1500 ma.s.l.) acts as a topographic filter of dust destined for the Lanzhou and Mu Us regions while facilitating multi-phase recycling through localized deposition and remobilization; (3) Provenance shifts exhibit strong spatial dependency, with Lanzhou's dust load dominated by Gurbantunggut provenance (26.1 %), then Taklimakan (18.3 %); but Mu Us dust dominated by Alxa (27.5 %), then Taklimakan (21.6 %). These findings redefine our understanding of East Asian dust dynamics by demonstrating how elevation barriers and sedimentary recycling jointly modulate source-sink relationships over millennial scales."

Naimie;Da Pan;Amy P. Sullivan;John T. Walker;Aleksandra Djurkovic;Bret A. Schichtel;Jeffrey L. Collett Jr.,Sensitivity of simulated ammonia fluxes in  Rocky Mountain National Park to measurement time resolution and meteorological inputs,"The contribution of ammonia atmosphere-surface exchange to excess deposition of reactive nitrogen is poorly understood. Reactive nitrogen deposition has negative impacts on ecosystem health. Ammonia can be difficult and expensive to measure. We demonstrate that depositions modeled using low-cost measurements underestimate ecosystem inputs but can be corrected using typical daily concentration cycles. We also illustrate the limitations of reanalysis meteorology for ammonia deposition modeling. 
 Gaseous ammonia (NH3) is an important precursor for secondary aerosol formation and contributes to reactive nitrogen deposition. NH3 dry deposition is poorly quantified due to the complex bidirectional nature of NH3 atmosphere-surface exchange and lack of high time-resolution in situ NH3 concentration and meteorological measurements. To better quantify NH3 dry deposition, measurements of NH3 were made above a subalpine forest canopy in Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP) and used with in situ micrometeorology to simulate bidirectional fluxes. NH3 dry deposition was largest during the summer, with 47 % of annual net NH3 dry deposition occurring in June, July, and August. Because in situ, high time-resolution concentration and meteorological data are often unavailable, the impacts on estimated deposition from utilizing more commonly available biweekly NH3 measurements and ERA5 meteorology were evaluated. Fluxes simulated with biweekly NH3 concentrations, commonly available from NH3 monitoring networks, underestimated NH3 dry deposition by 45 %. These fluxes were strongly correlated with 30 min fluxes integrated to a biweekly basis (R2 = 0.88), indicating that a correction factor could be applied to mitigate the observed bias. Application of an average NH3 diel concentration pattern to the biweekly NH3 concentration data removed the observed low bias. Annual NH3 dry deposition from fluxes simulated with reanalysis meteorological inputs exceeded simulations using in situ meteorology measurements by a factor of 2."

By using advanced computer models, we examined the impact of different emissions and environmental conditions on these aerosols in Central Europe. Our findings show that including specific emissions significantly improved the accuracy of our predictions. 
 This study explores the uncertainties in modeling organic aerosol (OA) over Central Europe, focusing on the roles of chemical mechanisms, emission parameterizations, and boundary conditions. Organic aerosols, particularly secondary organic aerosols (SOAs), significantly influence climate, health, and visibility, comprising up to 90 % of submicron particulate matter. Using the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) coupled with the Weather Research and Forecast Model, sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of intermediate-volatility organic compounds (IVOCs), semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), and chemical boundary conditions on primary and secondary organic aerosol concentrations.Model evaluation against organic carbon measurements over the Czech Republic showed that including source-specific IVOC and SVOC emissions significantly improved CAMx's performance, particularly when using the 1.5-dimensional Volatility Basis Set framework with activated chemical aging. For example, the domain-averaged SOA concentrations increased by up to 1.17 µg m−3 during summer when both IVOC and SVOC emissions were included. Furthermore, incorporating OA into the boundary conditions enhanced model predictions, with the accuracy of modeled organic carbon concentrations significantly improved during summer at some monitoring sites. Despite these improvements, challenges remain due to uncertainties in emission estimates, parameterization schemes, and the spatial resolution of the models.The findings underscore the importance of refined parameterizations for IVOC and SVOC emissions, higher temporal and spatial resolution in chemical boundary conditions, and better representation of chemical aging. Addressing these gaps in future studies will further enhance the understanding and prediction of OA dynamics in regional air quality modeling."
10.5194/acp-25-15359-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注北极地区氯酸（HClO3）参与的新粒子生成（NPF）机制，特别是氯酸与二甲胺（DMA）和硫酸（SA）相互作用的影响。论文利用密度泛函理论（DFT）和大气团簇动力学模拟（ACDC）在分子水平上研究了这些物质的团簇形成过程，旨在揭示海洋环境中含氯物质对北极地区新粒子生成的影响。虽然该研究与大气成分有关，但它侧重于化学反应机理和动力学模拟，而非直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['chloric acid', 'dimethylamine', 'sulfuric acid', 'new particle formation', 'nucleation', 'Arctic boundary layer', 'cluster dynamics']",Shengming Wang;Huidi Zhang;Xiangli Shi;Qingzhu Zhang;Wenxing Wang;Qiao Wang,Chloric acid-driven nucleation enhanced by dimethylamine and sulfuric acid in the Arctic: mechanistic study,"Recent studies have shown that chloric acid (HClO3, CA) is prevalent in the Arctic boundary layer. However, the mechanism of CA-based nucleation is unclear. We provide molecular-level evidence that CA-dimethylamine (DMA) nucleation may not effectively contribute to Arctic new particle formation (NPF). The proposed CA-DMA nucleation mechanism may help us to deeply understand marine NPF events in the Arctic boundary layer. 
 Chlorine radicals are strong oxidizing agents in the atmosphere, and the process of chlorine oxidation results in the formation of chloric acid (HClO3, CA). Recent studies have shown that trace amounts of CA have been detected in the Arctic boundary layer. However, the contribution of chlorine-containing species to oceanic new particle formation (NPF) has not been fully revealed. It is speculated that CA is involved in the oceanic nucleation process. In this study, the enhancement of CA-based NPF by dimethylamine (DMA) and sulfuric acid (SA) was comparatively investigated at the molecular level using density-functional theory (DFT) and atmospheric cluster dynamics simulation (ACDC). The results show that DMA can form clusters with CA through hydrogen bonding, halogen bonding and proton transfer, which reduces the energy barrier for CA-based cluster formation and significantly improves the thermodynamic stability of CA clusters. The cluster formation rate of CA-DMA cluster system is higher than that of the CA-SA cluster system. CA-DMA nucleation may not effectively contribute to Arctic NPF. These findings may help to reveal some of the missing sources of the Arctic NPF. The present study contributes to a deeper understanding of the influence of oceanic chlorine-containing constituents on the oceanic NPF."

Goldstein,Biogenic and anthropogenic contributions to urban terpenoid fluxes,"Terpenoids are organic gases that can originate from natural and human-caused sources, and their reactions in the atmosphere can cause air pollution. In this study, emissions of organic gases in an urban environment were measured. For some terpenoids, human-caused sources were responsible for about a quarter of the emissions, while others were predominantly from vegetation. This study contributes to a better understanding of urban emission sources and causes of air pollution. 
 Terpenoids influence atmospheric chemistry through rapid oxidation reactions which form secondary products including ozone and secondary organic aerosols (SOA). Source apportionment of terpenoids is complicated in urban environments because there are biogenic and anthropogenic sources. This study utilizes measured fluxes of isoprene, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes with MEGAN, a biogenic emissions model, and FIVE-VCP, an anthropogenic emissions inventory, to characterize urban terpenoid emissions. Volatile organic compound (VOC) mixing ratios were measured using a Vocus proton-transfer reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) during the URBAN-EC (Urban Research on Biogenic and ANthropogenic Emissions of Carbon) study in Berkeley, California from May to November 2022. Fluxes were calculated using the eddy covariance technique. Median fluxes of isoprene, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes were 0.269, 0.182, and 0.013 nmol m−2 s−1 respectively. Terpenoids were 2 % of the measured molar flux, 26 % of OH reactivity flux, and 21 % of SOA formation potential. The MEGAN isoprene emission factor was 4.56 nmol (m2 leaf area)−1 s−1. MEGAN isoprene fluxes matched URBAN-EC distributions seasonally and diurnally, while MEGAN monoterpene and sesquiterpene fluxes had more pronounced seasonal trends and lower morning emissions relative to URBAN-EC. Weekday/weekend differences were used to determine if terpenoids had anthropogenic sources. Monoterpene and sesquiterpene fluxes were significantly higher on weekdays (p<0.05); these differences were not represented in MEGAN or FIVE-VCP. Monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes had lower-bound anthropogenic fractions of 23 % and 24 %. Personal care products were not an important contributor to monoterpene emissions. This study presents a detailed analysis of urban terpenoid fluxes and contributes to better understanding their sources."

We used aircraft to measure BC, CO, and CO2 over the Yellow Sea across seasons. Our results show that BC changes in size and mixing state significantly depending on its origin and weather during transport, highlighting the need for better model representation of this pollutant. 
 Both size and mixing state of Black Carbon (BC) are critical climate-relevant physical parameters. It remains a challenge for ambient measurements to characterize their variability across different atmospheric conditions particularly in outflow regions. To investigate how BC's physical properties are determined in source regions and altered during transport, we conducted 23 flight measurements of BC, CO, and CO2 over the Yellow Sea from 2021 to 2022. The refractory BC mass concentration (MrBC) varied by up to two orders of magnitude between near sea surface and around 5 km above sea level, and Planetary Boundary Layer height-dependence of MrBC was stronger in winter than in spring. Smallest rBC's mass median diameter (MMD, 163.4 nm) observed in South Korea-sourced air indicated fresh urban emissions, whereas larger MMD, enhanced internal mixing, and higher rBC/CO slopes were exhibited in the air masses from North Korea and China, reflecting additional emissions from biomass and coal combustion. Both MMD and internal mixing tended to decrease with altitude, highlighting the wet scavenging effect during particle transport. When accumulated precipitation exceeded 1 mm, MrBC decreased by more than 50 %, with moderate decrease in MMD and internal mixing. As a result, overall BC transport efficiency declined to 1/e within 5.5 d. These observations reflect the complex effects of source region, seasonality, and wet removal on varying rBC distributions in the outflow region. These findings provide valuable observational constraints for improving model representations of the size distribution and mixing state of ambient BC particles in outflow regions."

With this procedure, observation datasets can be analyzed to extract gravity wave parameters, such as period, horizontal wavelength, and phase speed, for climatological purposes. The procedure showed reliable performance and is ready for use at other observation sites. 
 Medium-scale gravity waves (MSGWs) are atmospheric waves with horizontal scales ranging from 50 to 1000 km that can be observed through airglow all-sky images. This research introduces a novel algorithm that automatically identifies MSGWs using the keogram technique to study the waves over the Antarctic Peninsula. MSGWs were observed with an all-sky airglow imager located at the Brazilian Comandante Ferraz Antarctic Station (CF, 62° S), near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. Several preprocessing techniques are necessary to extract the parameters of MSGWs from the airglow images. These include projecting the images into geographical coordinates, applying a flat-field correction, performing consecutive image subtraction, and employing a Butterworth filter to enhance the visibility of the MSGWs. Additionally, a wavelet transform is used to identify the primary oscillations of the MSGWs in the keograms.  Subsequently, a wavelet transform is also used to reconstruct the MSGWs and obtain the fitting coefficients of phase lines. The fitting coefficients are then used to calculate the MSGW parameters and assess the quality of the results. Simulations with synthetic images containing typical propagating gravity waves were conducted to evaluate the errors generated during the MSGW calculations and to determine the threshold for the fitting parameters. This methodology processed a year's worth of data in less than 1 h, successfully identifying most waves with errors lower than 5 %. The observed wave parameters are generally consistent with expected results; however, they show differences from other observation sites, exhibiting larger phase speeds and wavelengths."

Existing methods require supporting data from other instruments – making them unusable in remote regions like the Tibetan Plateau. Our innovation enables fully independent cloud identification using only the radiometer's data. This self-contained solution eliminates dependencies on external equipment or historical datasets, providing a practical cloud monitoring method for isolated sites where conventional approaches fail. 
 Accurate cloud detection over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is crucial for understanding regional weather patterns and global climate dynamics. Yet, it remains challenging due to harsh environmental conditions and sparse observations. While ground-based infrared radiometers offer a promising solution through downwelling infrared brightness temperature (IRBT) measurements, existing algorithms require supplementary meteorological data often unavailable in remote TP regions. This study presents a novel cloud detection algorithm that operates solely on IRBT data from a single ground-based infrared radiometer, addressing the critical need for autonomous cloud monitoring in resource-limited environments. The algorithm integrates spectral and temporal analysis approaches: the spectral test identifies cloud presence by comparing observed IRBT against statistically derived clear-sky diurnal cycles, and the temporal test detects clouds through IRBT variability analysis using sliding standard deviation calculations. A key innovation includes a normalization procedure that effectively mitigates dust contamination effects – a persistent challenge in the arid TP environment that can introduce extremely large errors. Validation against 13 months of radiosonde data demonstrates robust performance with agreement rates exceeding 70 % in most months, with particularly effective performance during the wet season. This work provides a practical and cost-effective solution for autonomous cloud monitoring over the TP, with potential for application in other regions with limited observational data."

These approaches can guide future large research projects. 
 Large, multidisciplinary projects that collect vast amounts of data are becoming increasingly common in academia. Efficiently managing data across and beyond such projects necessitates a shift from fragmented efforts to coordinated, collaborative approaches. This article presents the data management strategies employed in the Nansen Legacy project (https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-323-90427-8.00009-5, Wassmann, 2022), a multidisciplinary Norwegian research initiative involving over 300 researchers and 20 expeditions into and around the northern Barents Sea. To enhance consistency in data collection, sampling protocols were developed and implemented across different teams and expeditions. A searchable metadata catalogue was established, providing an overview of all collected data within weeks of each expedition. The project also implemented a policy that mandates immediate data sharing among members and publishing of data in accordance with the FAIR guiding principles where feasible. We detail how these strategies were implemented and discuss the successes and challenges, offering insights and lessons learned to guide future projects in similar endeavours."

 This work presents a comprehensive global GNSS climate data record derived from 5085 stations, spanning up to a 22-year period 2000–2021. The dataset was generated using the state-of-the-art processing methodologies and precise products from the International GNSS Service (IGS) Repro-3 initiative. It includes high-quality hourly estimates of Zenith Total Delay (ZTD) and Precipitable Water Vapour (PWV), offering improved accuracy and spatiotemporal coverage. A rigorous data screening and quality assessment framework was implemented, including formal error detection, offset identification, and extensive cross-validation with ERA5 reanalysis dataset, radiosonde profiles, and Very Long Baseline Interferometry measurements. Collectively, these efforts ensured the consistency, accuracy, and homogeneity of the dataset. In addition, diurnal, monthly, and annual variations in ZTD and PWV have been analysed to evaluate and demonstrate its feasibility for monitoring climate variability, atmospheric circulation, and weather extremes. The insights provided by the dataset address critical data gaps in global climate observing systems and provide a robust foundation for advancing climate research and applications.

However, when flying above sea-ice, satellites pick up noisy signals coming from holes in the sea-ice cover. We reprocess these signals, extracting local sea level measurement. By integrating them with open ocean sea level estimates, we create the longest continuous record of sea level measurements in both ice-covered and ice-free Antarctic waters. 
 Antarctic Sea Level Anomalies (SLA) remain poorly observed due to the presence of sea ice, which hampers conventional satellite altimetry. Recent advances in lead-based retracking techniques have enabled SLA estimation within ice-covered regions. However, existing products are temporally limited, with currently available dataset covering periods shorter than 10 years. In this study, we extend the time span of SLA reconstruction by processing multiple satellite missions: Envisat, CryoSat-2, SARAL/Altika, and Sentinel-3A. We produce a consistent and continuous SLA dataset spanning both ice-free and ice-covered areas of the Southern Ocean (south of 50° S) from 2003 to 2021. This 19-year product provides the longest temporal coverage to date for SLA under sea ice. The resulting SLA fields resolve the large-scale variability and parts of the mesoscale signal, with smooth transitions across the sea-ice edge. We show that the product reliably captures physical signals on timescales longer than 10 days, with estimated uncertainties of 1.3 cm. in the subpolar ocean. Our satellite-based SLA reconstruction compares well with most independent in situ observations from tide gauges and bottom pressure recorders: mean correlation coefficients are 0.58 and 0.66, respectively. The reconstruction fills a key observational gap and offers new opportunities to study trends and interannual variability in sea level and ocean circulation in the Southern Ocean, particularly under sea-ice cover."

WOFOST-EW significantly improves the simulation of winter wheat growth under extreme weather conditions, providing more accurate predictions of phenology and yield. As extreme weather events become more frequent, WOFOST-EW provides a key tool for agricultural development. 
 Extreme weather events pose significant challenges to crop production, making their assessment essential for developing effective climate adaptation strategies. Process-based crop models are valuable for evaluating climate change impacts on crop yields but often struggle to simulate the effects of extreme weather accurately. To fill this knowledge gap, this study introduces WOFOST-EW v1, an enhanced version of the World Food Studies Simulation Model (WOFOST), which integrates extreme weather indices and deep learning algorithm to improve simulations of winter wheat growth under extreme conditions. Deep learning offers powerful nonlinear fitting capabilities, enabling it to capture subtle and intricate interactions between extreme weather events and crop development, thereby significantly improving simulation accuracy under extreme scenarios. We validate WOFOST-EW using phenological, yield, and extreme weather data from agricultural meteorological stations in the North China Plain. The results show that WOFOST-EW improves simulation accuracy. The RRMSE for heading and maturity decreases from 4.61 % to 3.73 % and from 4.74 % to 3.98 %, respectively (with RMSE reductions of 10.64 % and 12.86 %). The R2 value for yield simulations increases from 0.67 to 0.76. In addition, we further validate the WOFOST-EW model in years affected by extreme weather and find that, compared to the original WOFOST model (R2 ranging from 0.61 to 0.71), WOFOST-EW achieves more accurate results (R2 ranging from 0.80 to 0.86). WOFOST-EW effectively captures the impacts of extreme weather, offering a reliable tool for agricultural planning and climate adaptation. As extreme weather events become increasingly frequent, WOFOST-EW can assist decision-makers in more accurately evaluating crop yields, providing technical support for agricultural systems in the context of global climate change."

Convective precipitation is potentially hazardous and difficult to predict. Cloud microphysics schemes contribute significantly to this uncertainty. Depending on the microphysics used, the simulated precipitation distribution varies significantly. The main reason for these differences are the underlying rain drop size distributions. 
 The representation of cloud microphysics in numerical weather prediction models contributes significantly to the uncertainty of weather forecasts. Polarimetric radar observations are increasingly used to evaluate numerical weather simulations, due to their sensitivity to microphysical properties. Typically, this evaluation is performed for individual case studies, which limits the generalizability of the results. This is particularly problematic for convective precipitation events, which are characterized by high variability due to their small scale and rapid error growth of initial uncertainties, and are often associated with severe weather phenomena. In this study, the performance of microphysics schemes in the simulation of convective precipitation events is evaluated statistically over a 30 d dataset. The aim is to assess the distribution of precipitation into convective and stratiform regions, and the microphysical properties in these regions based on radar reflectivity and differential reflectivity. Within a Weather Research and Forecasting model setup, 5 different microphysics schemes of varying complexity are evaluated. The choice of microphysics schemes has a significant impact on the distribution of precipitation; the median convective area fraction varies by an order of magnitude between the microphysics schemes. These differences are attributed to differences in rain drop size distributions. In the convective core, the FSBM and Morrison schemes frequently lack large rain drops, while the Thompson and P3 schemes simulate too many. Statistical evaluations are important to address the prevailing uncertainty surrounding cloud microphysics. The framework presented in this study can serve as a guide for future statistical evaluations of weather models with polarimetric radar observations."

 Quantum error correction (QEC) [1,2] is essential for the realization of large-scale quantum computers [3,4]. However, due to the complexity of operating on the encoded ‘logical’ qubits [5,6], understanding the physical principles for building fault-tolerant quantum devices and combining them into efficient architectures is an outstanding scientific challenge. Here we utilize reconfigurable arrays of up to 448 neutral atoms to implement the key elements of a universal, fault-tolerant quantum processing architecture and experimentally explore their underlying working mechanisms. We first employ surface codes to study how repeated QEC suppresses errors [6,7], demonstrating 2.14(13)x below-threshold performance in a four-round characterization circuit by leveraging atom loss detection and machine learning decoding [8,9]. We then investigate logical entanglement using transversal gates and lattice surgery [10–12], and extend it to universal logic through transversal teleportation with 3D [[15,1,3]] codes [13,14], enabling arbitrary-angle synthesis with polylogarithmic overhead [5,15]. Finally, we develop mid-circuit qubit re-use [16], increasing experimental cycle rates by two orders of magnitude and enabling deep-circuit protocols with dozens of logical qubits and hundreds of logical teleportations [17–20] with [[7,1,3]] and high-rate [[16,6,4]] codes while maintaining constant internal entropy. Our experiments reveal key principles for efficient architecture design, involving the interplay between quantum logic & entropy removal, judiciously using physical entanglement in logic gates & magic state generation, and leveraging teleportations for universality & physical qubit reset.

 Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation photovoltaic technology due to their ultra-high power conversion efficiency (PCE)1-3. However, the mechanical stress generated during repeated environmental stress cycles remains a critical challenge for flexible perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells, leading to interfacial delamination and device degradation. In this work, we propose a dual-buffer-layer strategy with a stress-release mechanism to synergistically mitigate ion bombardment during subsequent sputtering deposition and enhance interfacial adhesion while preserving efficient charge extraction. The loose SnOx buffer layer, engineered by adjusting the purging time of atomic layer deposition, can dissipate strain energy, whereas the compact SnOx layer can ensure robust electrical contact. Based on this dual-buffer-layer, the flexible tandem solar cell, constructed on a 60-micron thick ultra-thin silicon bottom cell, achieves a certified PCE of 33.4% on 1-cm2 area, and an certified PCE of 29.8% on wafer-sized area of 260-cm2 with a power-per-weight of up to 1.77 W/g.

 Magnetostriction plays a pivotal role in magneto-mechanical systems. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a mechanical frequency comb solely requiring the fundamental mode f0 of a magnetostrictive mm-scale macroresonator. Both integer-harmonic combs and half-integer-harmonic combs are observed in kHz regime with Hz resolution by near-resonant pumping fp ≈ f0 and parametrical stiffness modulation fs ≪ f0. The tooth spacing of both combs is determined by fs, which can be continuously tuned by changing fs from Hz to kHz. Moreover, the half-integer-harmonic combs can be purposely switched with frequency shifting half a tooth spacing via suppressing period-doubling bifurcation. The experimentally observed formation, evolution, and switching of combs can be well understood by introducing the bias magnetical force and the parametrically modulated stiffness into the Duffing equation. Our findings could provide a magneto-mechanical platform with tunability for potential applications in the acoustic frequency range such as non-invasive/contactless sensor and wireless antenna.

 Sepsis-induced liver injury is common, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Given the critical role of gut-liver crosstalk in sepsis, we hypothesize that gut-trained neutrophils, migrating via the portal vein, release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to activate Kupffer cells, thereby exacerbating hepatic injury during sepsis. Here we show that iNOS expression in Kupffer cells increases in septic wild type mice but decreases in PAD4-/- mice. In vitro, NETs stimulate Kupffer cell IL-6 and TNF release, while conditioned media from NET-treated Kupffer cells induces hepatocyte death. Inhibition of neutrophil elastase and protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) mitigates IL-6 and TNF secretion by Kupffer cells. Ex vivo, portal vein neutrophils from septic mice produce more NETs and induce greater Kupffer cell activation than systemic neutrophils, with this effect attenuated in PAD4-/- neutrophils. Furthermore, gut intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) interact with neutrophils during sepsis and facilitate NETosis, and IEL-primed neutrophils also induce Kupffer cell activation in vitro and in vivo. Our data thus suggest that IEL-facilitated, gut-derived neutrophil NETs activate Kupffer cells to contribute to sepsis-induced liver injury. Sepsis often induces liver injury, but the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are still unclear.

 Although tuberculosis is preventable, whom to prioritize for preventive interventions is debated. As part of a follow-up to a mass tuberculosis screening, we aimed to evaluate tuberculosis incidence among persons with distinct baseline X-ray results. From March to October 2020, we implemented a mass tuberculosis screening intervention among elderly persons in eastern China. Participants were followed for incident tuberculosis until October 2022. Tuberculosis incidence over two years among participants with differing baseline chest X-ray results were assessed. Physical examinations and X-rays were administered to all participants. Among persons suspected of tuberculosis, computed tomography, culture or GeneXpert MTB/RIF was performed. Among 183,808 participants, 27,796 had a baseline abnormal X-ray. The annualized incidence per 100,000 person-years was 1,525 (95% CI, 989-2,243), 278 (202-373), 325 (218-466), and 61 (50–75) among participants with X-rays suggestive of active, stable, uncertain and normal, respectively. Among persons with X-ray findings suggestive of tuberculosis, the increased hazard was 16.7 (95% CI, 11.9–23.4). These results demonstrate the risk of developing tuberculosis among persons with an abnormal chest X-ray was very high. Combining mass screening with preventive interventions based on X-ray findings should be explored as a combination intervention package to reduce tuberculosis in high-risk populations.

Here, the authors use single-pulse X-ray imaging to show that surface plasmons channel energy relaxation into distinct pathways, leading to different shape deformations. 
 Ultrafast laser excitation can drive materials into exotic states beyond thermodynamic limits, offering alternative ways to control how matter stores and releases energy. Yet, whether light can actively steer energy-relaxation pathways during structural transitions remains unclear due to the lack of direct experimental evidence. Here we show, using single-pulse time-resolved X-ray imaging of gold nanorods, that photoinduced localized surface plasmons control ultrafast energy relaxation into distinct deformation modes, transverse or longitudinal deformation modes, each accompanied by characteristic plasmon-induced oscillatory distortions depending on the laser fluence. Numerical simulations further confirm that localized surface plasmons dictate ultrafast energy relaxation process from photoexcited hot electrons to anharmonic nanocrystal deformations. Our results provide direct evidence that surface plasmon-mediated interactions enable ultrafast, nanoscale control of materials’ energetics, opening a pathway for tailoring energy-transfer processes with femtosecond laser fields. This approach lays the foundation for customizing nonequilibrium phase dynamics at the nanoscale and provides a route to tailoring energy-transfer processes using femtosecond laser fields.

 The CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex drives NF-κB signaling and MALT1 protease activation after T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, forming a central signaling hub in adaptive immunity. Both linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), consisting of HOIP, HOIL-1 and SHARPIN, and TRAF6 interact with the CBM complex. Still, the coordinated activity of these E3 ligases in controlling CBM activity remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that LUBAC, unlike TRAF6, is largely dispensable for TCR-induced NF-κB activation in human CD4+ T cells. However, HOIP contributes to NF-κB target gene expression and, with TRAF6, modulates MALT1 substrate recognition, influencing T cell responses. Further, LUBAC-mediated conjugation of Met1-linked ubiquitin chains to BCL10 strictly depends on TRAF6, but putative Met1-ubiquitin acceptor lysines in BCL10 serve essential structural roles that limit accessibility within BCL10-MALT1 filaments. Thus, LUBAC acts downstream of TRAF6 to modulate MALT1 substrate recognition and to catalyze BCL10 ubiquitination, which is incompatible with BCL10-MALT1 filament formation.

 Snakebite, a neglected tropical disease is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in India, despite which reliable nationwide data are limited. To address this, we carried out a survey in 25 districts across 11 states, covering a 60 million population. The community-based study was led by frontline health workers who tracked cases and deaths, while field teams collected details on the bite, the type of snake, treatment received, and costs. Data were gathered continuously for a one-year period. Here we show that 7,094 snakebite cases were recorded, with a mortality rate of 0.33 per 100,000 population. Nearly half of the reported deaths occurred outside hospital settings. Bites were most common in males (64.1%), adults aged 30–39 years (20.9%), and during the monsoon season (62.1%). Most victims (86.4%) sought hospital care, 60.2% received anti-snake venom, and 17.2% experienced side effects to the anti-venom. Treatment placed a heavy financial burden on families; average out-of-pocket expenditure was INR 6,500, with higher costs in private hospitals (INR 27,400) compared to public facilities (INR 3,900). And 47.5% of the victims belonged to households below the poverty line.

Here, the authors derive theoretical formulae showing that higher variance along task-relevant directions accelerates learning speed, providing a framework consistent with empirical findings. 
 Learning speed depends on both task structure and neural dynamics prior to learning, yet a theory connecting them has been missing. Inspired by the fluctuation-response relation, we derive two formulae linking neural dynamics to learning. Initial learning speed is proportional to the covariance between pre-learning spontaneous activity and network’s input-evoked response, independent of the learning rule. For Hebb-type learning, initial speed scales with the variance of activity along target and input directions. These results apply across tasks including input-output mapping and time-series generation. Numerical simulations across diverse models validate the formulae beyond the theoretical-derivation’s assumptions. Although derived for early learning, the formulae predict total learning time. A straightforward implication is learning is faster when task-relevant directions align with high-variance spontaneous activities, consistent with empirical findings. Our framework establishes how the geometrical relationship between pre-learning dynamics and task directions governs learning speed, independent of details of tasks. Spontaneous neural activity has been experimentally linked to learning ability.

Their findings emphasize the importance of preserving interspecific connectivity. 
 Climate change is rapidly driving environmental shifts, posing an increasing threat to global biodiversity. Interspecific introgression—in which genetic material is transferred from one species to another following hybridization—may facilitate climate adaptation by introducing new genetic variation, which could mitigate species’ vulnerability to changing conditions. Here, using population and ecological genomic approaches and genetic offset modelling for future climates, we show that hybrid mountainous birds showed reduced vulnerability to climate change compared with non-hybrid counterparts. While geographic isolation and ecological heterogeneity promoted species divergence and distinct climatic niche requirements, gene flow persists at contact zones between these species. Maintaining current gene flow rates is projected to buffer against climate change risks over the next 40 generations. These findings demonstrate the role of interspecific introgression in enhancing climate resilience and future survival, and emphasize the conservation importance of preserving gene flow among species with narrow environmental tolerances.

Riverbed lowering due to sand mining and sediment diversion has substantially reduced the annual flood pulse and is projected to worsen if business continues as usual. 
 The Tonle Sap Lake (TSL), one of the world’s most productive lake–wetland ecosystems is sustained by an annual flood pulse that reverses Lower Mekong River flow into the lake during the monsoon and returns freshwater downstream during the dry season. Recent declines in the reverse flow have previously been attributed to climate change and upstream damming. However, here we show that between 1998 and 2018, riverbed lowering of the Mekong mainstem, driven by sand mining and upstream sediment trapping, has reduced the reverse flow by between 40 and 50% (high- to low-flow year range; 47% for medium flows). Projections to 2038, with additional riverbed lowering driven by ongoing sand mining, predict reverse flow declines of 69% (64–73%) compared with 1998. We show how these changes affect the lake’s flow regulation services across the Lower Mekong system. Specifically, the reduced TSL reverse flow increases flows to the Mekong Delta by ~26 km3 (31–23 km3) during the monsoon, heightening flood risk, while decreasing dry-season flows by ~59% (50–61%), contributing to intensified saltwater intrusion and diminished agricultural yields across the Mekong’s Delta. Our results underscore how excessive sand extraction is an existential threat to the TSL–Mekong system’s sustainability. The annual flood of Tonle Sap Lake supports over 20 million people’s livelihoods. Riverbed lowering due to sand mining and sediment diversion has substantially reduced the annual flood pulse and is projected to worsen if business continues as usual."

 The rapidly increasing demand for generative artificial intelligence (AI) models requires extensive server installation with sustainability implications in terms of the compound energy–water–climate impacts.

Other factors, such as industry efficiency initiatives, grid decarbonization rates and the spatial distribution of server locations within the United States, drive deep uncertainties in the estimated water and carbon footprints. We show that the AI server industry is unlikely to meet its net-zero aspirations by 2030 without substantial reliance on highly uncertain carbon offset and water restoration mechanisms. Although best practices may reduce emissions and water footprints by up to 73% and 86%, respectively, their effectiveness is constrained by current energy infrastructure limitations.

The detailed sources of OA, especially precursors and formation processes of secondary OA (SOA) in megacities remain unclear, largely due to lack of molecular composition. We characterized the molecular composition of OA using online extractive electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer in winter Shanghai. Eleven OA sources were identified using Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF), combined with gas-phase organic precursors and other auxiliary measurements. We identified a plasticizer-related OA source and a primary biomass burning OA source containing likely oxidation products of biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs). SOA from photo-oxidation and aged biomass burning contributed substantially (~48%) to OA and dominated in SOA. Possible precursors of photo-oxidation SOA included aromatics and oxygenated VOCs. The nighttime oxidation of aldehydes and ketones by NO3 radicals were important sources of SOA. Aqueous SOA derived from aged biomass burning emissions also contributed markedly to OA. Our results here highlight the previously under-appreciated sources and formation processes of OA in megacities, improving our understanding of OA sources and providing support for more accurate air pollution control strategies."

 Magnetite is a principal paleomagnetic recorder on Earth, but lunar magnetism is thought to be dominated by metallic iron and Fe-Ni alloys, with magnetite rare and typically sub-micrometer within troilite. We identify nanometer- to micrometer-scale magnetite in pentlandite-troilite assemblages from a Chang’e-5 regolith breccia. Magnetite occurs at and within pentlandite, locally enclosing pentlandite nanoinclusions, implying a formation pathway distinct from troilite-hosted occurrences. Textures and compositions indicate sequential crystallization from an impact-generated Fe-Ni-S-O melt: rapid pentlandite growth along troilite margins followed by magnetite nucleation at sulfide-silicate interfaces. The lunar low oxygen fugacity stabilizes Fe2+-enriched magnetite, unlike terrestrial analogues. High crystallinity and single-domain to single-vortex states indicate strong remanence stability, making these grains reliable recorders of the contemporaneous lunar magnetic fields. These results broaden the inventory of lunar magnetic carriers, demonstrate impact-driven magnetite formation under lunar redox conditions, and motivate use of magnetite to refine the Moon’s magnetic history.
