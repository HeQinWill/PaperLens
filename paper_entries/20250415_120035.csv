Sheese,Age of air from ACE-FTS measurements  of sulfur hexafluoride,"We present a 17-year stratospheric age-of-air dataset derived from ACE-FTS satellite measurements of sulfur hexafluoride. This is the longest continuous, global, and vertically resolved age of air time series available to date. In this paper, we show that this dataset agrees well with age-of-air datasets based on measurements from other instruments. We also present trends in the midlatitude lower stratosphere that indicate changes in the global circulation that are predicted by climate models. 
 Climate models predict that the Brewer–Dobson circulation (BDC) will accelerate due to tropospheric warming, leading to a redistribution of trace gases and, consequently, to a change of the radiative properties of the atmosphere. Changes in the BDC are diagnosed by the so-called “age of air”, that is, the time since air in the stratosphere exited the troposphere. These changes can be derived from a long-term observation-based record of long-lived trace gases with increasing concentration in the troposphere, such as sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). The Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) provides the longest available continuous time series of vertically resolved SF6 measurements, spanning 2004 to the present. In this study, a new age-of-air product is derived from the ACE-FTS SF6 dataset. The ACE-FTS product is in good agreement with other observation-based age-of-air datasets and shows the expected global distribution of age-of-air values. Age of air from a chemistry–climate model is evaluated, and the linear trend of the observation-based age of air is calculated in 12 regions within the lower stratospheric midlatitudes (14–20 km, 40–70°) in each hemisphere. In 8 of 12 regions, there was not a statistically significant trend. The trends in the other regions, specifically 50–60 and 60–70° S at 17–20 km and 40–50° N at 14–17 and 17–20 km, are negative and significant to 2 standard deviations. This is therefore the first observation-based age-of-air trend study to suggest an acceleration of the shallow branch of the BDC, which transports air poleward in the lower stratosphere, in regions within both hemispheres."

Y. Yung;Jin Wu;Sien Li;Amos P. K. Tai,Impacts of irrigation on ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air quality: implications for emission control strategies for intensively irrigated regions in China,"This study utilizes a regional climate–air quality coupled model to first investigate the complex interaction between irrigation, climate and air quality in China. We found that large-scale irrigation practices reduce summertime surface ozone while raising secondary inorganic aerosol concentration via complicated physical and chemical processes. Our results emphasize the importance of making a tradeoff between air pollution controls and sustainable agricultural development. 
 Intensive irrigation is known to alleviate crop water stress and alter regional climate, which can in turn influence air quality, with ramifications for human health and food security. However, the interplay between irrigation, climate and air pollution especially in the simultaneously intensively irrigated and heavily polluted regions in China has rarely been studied. Here we incorporated a dynamic irrigation scheme into a regional climate–air quality coupled model to examine the potential impacts of irrigation on ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in China. Results show that irrigation increases PM2.5 by 12 µg m−3 (28 %) but reduces O3 concentration by 3–4 ppb (6 %–8 %). Among PM2.5, nitrate and ammonium aerosols rise by 70 % and 40 %, respectively, upon introducing irrigation, with secondary formation contributing to ∼ 60 % and 10 %–30 %, respectively. High humidity and low temperature promote the formation of ammonium nitrate aerosols. To mitigate these adverse effects on PM2.5 air quality, we found that a 20 % reduction in NH3 and NOx emissions is more effective compared with individual emission reductions, while the enhancement in O3 due to the NOx reduction can be completely offset by irrigation itself. Our study highlights the potential benefits of irrigation regarding O3 pollution but potential problems regarding PM2.5 pollution under currently prevalent irrigation modes and anthropogenic emission scenarios, emphasizing the need for an integrated approach to balance water conservation, air pollution, climate change mitigation and food security in the face of development needs."

Fu;Li Li,Recommendations on benchmarks for numerical air quality model applications in China – Part 2: Ozone and uncertainty analysis,"Ground-level ozone pollution has emerged as a significant air pollutant in China. Chemical transport models (CTMs) serve as crucial tools in addressing ozone pollution. This study reviews CTM applications for simulating ozone in China and proposes goal and criteria benchmark values for evaluating ozone. Along with prior work on PM₂₅ and other pollutants, this effort establishes a comprehensive framework for evaluating CTM performance in China. 
 Ground-level ozone (O3) has emerged as a significant air pollutant in China, attracting increasing attention from both the scientific community and policymakers. Chemical transport models (CTMs) serve as crucial tools in addressing O3 pollution, with frequent applications in predicting O3 concentrations, identifying source contributions, and formulating effective control strategies. The accuracy and reliability of the simulated O3 concentrations are typically assessed through model performance evaluation (MPE). However, the wide array of CTMs available, variations in input data, model setups, and other factors result in a broad range of differences between simulated and observed O3 concentrations, highlighting the necessity of standardized benchmarks in O3 evaluation.Building upon our previous work, this study conducted a thorough literature review of CTM applications simulating O3 in China from 2006 to 2021. A total of 216 relevant articles out of a total of 667 reviewed were identified to extract quantitative MPE results and key model configurations. From our analysis, two sets of benchmark values for six commonly used MPE metrics are proposed for CTM applications in China, categorized into “goal” benchmarks representing optimal model performance and “criteria” benchmarks representing achievable model performance across a majority of studies. It is recommended that the normalized mean bias (NMB) for hourly O3 and daily 8 h maximum O3 concentrations should ideally fall within ±15 % and ±10 %, respectively, to meet the goal benchmark. If the criteria benchmarks are to be met, the NMB should be within ±30 % and ±20 %, respectively. Moreover, uncertainties in O3 predictions due to uncertainties in various model inputs were quantified using the decoupled direct method (DDM) in a commonly used CTM. For the simulation period of June 2021, the total uncertainty of simulated O3 ranged from 4 to 25 µg m−3, with anthropogenic volatile organic compound (AVOC) emissions contributing most to the uncertainty regarding O3 in coastal regions and with O3 boundary conditions playing a dominant role in the northwestern region. The proposed benchmarks for assessing simulated O3 concentrations, in conjunction with our previous studies on PM2.5 and other criteria air pollutants, represent a comprehensive and systematic effort to establish a model performance framework for CTM applications in China. These benchmarks aim to support the growing modeling community in China by offering a robust set of evaluation metrics and establishing a consistent evaluation methodology relative to the body of prior research, thereby helping to establish the credibility and reliability of CTM applications. These statistical benchmarks need to be periodically updated as models advance and as better inputs become available in the future."

Schneider,CAMELS-DK: hydrometeorological time series and landscape attributes for 3330 Danish catchments with streamflow observations from 304 gauged stations,"We developed a CAMELS-style dataset in Denmark, which contains hydrometeorological time series and landscape attributes for 3330 catchments (304 gauged). Many catchments in CAMELS-DK are small and at low elevations. The dataset provides information on groundwater characteristics and dynamics, as well as quantities related to the human impact on the hydrological system in Denmark. The dataset is especially relevant for developing data-driven and hybrid physically informed modeling frameworks. 
 Large samples of hydrometeorological time series and catchment attributes are critical for improving the understanding of complex hydrological processes, hydrological model development, and performance benchmarking. CAMELS (Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-sample Studies) datasets have been developed in several countries and regions around the world, providing valuable data sources and test beds for hydrological analysis and new frontiers in data-driven hydrological modeling. Regarding the lack of samples from lowland, groundwater-dominated, small-sized catchments, we develop an extensive repository of a CAMELS-style dataset for Denmark (CAMELS-DK). This CAMELS addition is the first containing both gauged and ungauged catchments as well as detailed groundwater information. The dataset provides dynamic and static variables for 3330 catchments covering all of Denmark from various hydrogeological datasets, meteorological observations, and a well-established national-scale hydrological model. For 304 of those catchments, streamflow observations are provided, whereas simulated streamflow is provided for all 3330 catchments. The dataset contains time series spanning 30 years (1989–2019) with a daily time step, and the data will be updated once new observations and model simulations become available. The dense and full spatial coverage for all 3330 catchments, instead of only gauged catchments, together with the addition of various simulation data from a distributed, process-based model, enhances the applicability of such CAMELS data, for example, for the development of data-driven and hybrid physically informed modeling frameworks or other cases where consistent full spatial coverage is required. We also provide quantities related to the human impact on the hydrological system in Denmark, such as groundwater abstraction and irrigation.

 Accurate estimate of groundwater recharge is crucial for prediction of groundwater table dynamics and dependent eco-hydrological processes. Despite their importance, benchmark data for groundwater recharge at fine (∼ daily) temporal resolution are lacking. We present a first-of-its-kind daily groundwater recharge per unit specific yield (RpSy) data over periods of 2–38 years at 485 groundwater monitoring wells in the US. The RpSy data for these locations are calculated from the daily groundwater table time series using the water table fluctuation (WTF) method. Although direct validation of the data is not possible since it is the first of its kind, we compare the RpSy data with the monthly USGS product to identify similarities and differences. The RpSy dataset may serve as a benchmark for validating the temporal consistency of recharge products and daily simulation results from land surface and integrated hydrologic models.

Here, we compiled reference soil data on these FRNs from the literature to build a comprehensive database. Using this database, we determined the distribution and sources of 137Cs and 239+240Pu. We also demonstrated how the database can be used to identify the environmental factors that influence their distribution using a machine learning algorithm. 
 Past nuclear weapons testing (NWT) and nuclear power plant (NPP) accidents have resulted in the ubiquitous deposition of radionuclides in the environment. These fallout radionuclides (FRNs) are considered the privileged markers (“golden spikes”) of the Anthropocene stratigraphic layers. Their deposition in the 1950s coincided with the “Great Acceleration”, which is characterized by large-scale shifts in the Earth's systems, including increased land-use change and soil degradation. Among the FRNs deposited globally, 137Cs has been the most commonly used to assess soil erosion and/or the chronology of sediment deposition, while 239+240Pu is an alternative soil erosion tracer and chronological marker that has been increasingly used due to a number of advantages.We compiled 137Cs and 239+240Pu data published from undisturbed (so-called “reference”) soils in the equatorial and Southern Hemisphere regions to build a database within the framework of the AVATAR (A reVised dATing framework for quantifying geomorphological processes during the Anthropocene) project. Using this database, named the AVATAR-Soils Database, we determined the distribution of 137Cs and 239+240Pu inventories in equatorial and Southern Hemisphere soils, along with the relative contributions of different fallout nuclear weapon sources by analyzing their isotopic ratios. Additionally, we demonstrated how the database can be used to identify the environmental factors that influence the distribution of 137Cs and 239+240Pu in reference soils by applying a machine learning algorithm.Our meta-analysis revealed that high 137Cs and 239+240Pu inventories were recorded near the Equator and within the 20–40° S latitudinal bands, which coincide with the location of multiple NWT locations. The 240Pu/239Pu atomic ratios suggest that sources other than the global fallout (primarily from US and USSR weapon testing with a 240Pu/239Pu atomic ratio of ∼ 0.18) contributed to the reference inventories in the Southern Hemisphere. These additional sources have been relatively neglected so far. Based on the 240Pu/239Pu atomic ratios, we have estimated that the French fallout contributed ∼ 20 % to the reference soil 239+240Pu inventories in South America and up to 70 % in French Polynesia. In contrast, the British fallout contributed ∼ 27 % to the reference soil 239+240Pu inventories in the rest of Oceania. Our machine learning algorithm identified the precipitation of the coldest quarter, longitude, and latitude as the strongest predictors of the 137Cs inventory. For the 239+240Pu inventory, the mean diurnal temperature range, the annual temperature range, and the precipitation of the driest quarter were the strongest predictors. Altogether, these findings demonstrate the potential of the AVATAR-Soils Database as a resource for improving our understanding of the distribution and sources of 137Cs and 239+240Pu in equatorial and Southern Hemisphere soils and refining their application as tools in various Earth science research.

 Soil temperature (Ts) is critical in regulating agricultural production, ecosystem functions, hydrological cycling and climate dynamics. However, the inherent spatial and temporal heterogeneity of soil thermal regimes constitutes a persistent challenge in obtaining high-resolution, continuous gridded Ts datasets along vertical profiles. To address this issue, we propose a spatially adaptive layer-cascading Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm to generate daily multi-layer Ts data (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 40 cm) at a spatial resolution of 1 km in China from 2010 to 2020. The methodology dynamically partitions non-uniformly distributed measuring sites (2,093 sites across the country) to quadtrees and incorporates thermal coupling effects propagated between neighbor soil layers. Multi-source data, including satellite retrievals of land surface temperature and vegetation index, and ERA5 reanalysis climate variables were used as inputs. Independent tests demonstrated high robustness and accuracy of our model, with depth-specific values of coefficients of determination (R²) being 0.94~0.98 and root mean square errors (RMSE) values ranging 1.75~2.21K. It is noted the model’s performance was lower in summers and winters than in springs and autumns.

 This study evaluates the performance of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) in forecasting a mega Asian dust storm (ADS) event that occurred over South Korea on 28–29 March 2021. We specifically evaluated a combination of five dust emission schemes and four land surface schemes, which are crucial for predicting ADSs. Using both in situ and remote sensing data, we assessed surface meteorological and air quality variables, including 2 m temperature, 2 m relative humidity, 10 m wind speed, particulate matter with a diameter of 10µm or less (PM10), and aerosol optical depth (AOD) over South Korea. Our results indicate that prediction of surface meteorological variables is more influenced by the land surface scheme than by the dust emission scheme – generally showing good performance when dust emission schemes are combined with the Noah land surface model with multiple parameterization options (Noah-MP). In contrast, prediction of air quality variables, including PM10 and AOD, is strongly affected by the dust emission schemes, which are directly related to the generation and amount of dust through interaction with surface properties. Among the total of 20 available scheme combinations, the University of Cologne 2004 scheme combined with the Community Land Model version 4.0 (UoC04-CLM4) showed the best performance, closely followed by the University of Cologne 2001 scheme combined with CLM4 (UoC01-CLM4). UoC04-CLM4 outperformed the other scheme combinations by reducing the root mean square errors of PM10 up to 29.6 %. However, both UoC04-CLM4 and UoC01-CLM4 simulated values closest to the MODIS AOD but tended to overestimate the AOD in some regions during the dust emission and transport processes. In contrast, other scheme combinations significantly underestimated the AOD throughout the entire simulation process of ADSs."

LM4-SHARC (soil–hillslope aquifer–river continuum) describes the hillslope groundwater using its emergent properties, yielding noticeable improvements in soil moisture/temperature and groundwater discharge predictions. The implications of groundwater-mediated hydrologic interactions between hillslopes and streams need further exploration in the Earth system modeling community. 
 Catchment-scale representation of the groundwater and its interaction with other parts of the hydrologic cycle is crucial for accurately depicting the land water–energy balance in Earth system models (ESMs). Despite existing efforts to describe the groundwater in the land component of ESMs, most ESMs still need a prognostic framework for describing catchment-scale groundwater based on its emergent properties to understand the implications for the broader Earth system. To fill this gap, we developed a new parameterization scheme to resolve the groundwater and its two-way interactions with the unsaturated soil and stream at the catchment scale. We implemented this new parameterization scheme (SHARC, or the soil–hillslope aquifer–river continuum) in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) land model (i.e., LM4-SHARC) and evaluated its performance. By bridging the gap between hydraulic groundwater theory and ESM land hydrology, the new LM4-SHARC provides a path to learning groundwater emergent properties from available streamflow data (i.e., recession analysis), enhancing the representation of subgrid variability in water–energy states induced by the groundwater.  LM4-SHARC has been applied to the Providence headwater catchment at Southern Sierra, NV, and tested against in situ observations. We found that LM4-SHARC leads to noticeable improvements in the representation of key hydrologic variables such as streamflow, near-surface soil moisture, and soil temperature. In addition to enhancing the representation of the water and energy balance, our analysis showed that accounting for groundwater convergence can induce a more significant hydrologic contrast, with higher sensitivity of soil water storage to groundwater properties in the riparian zone. Our findings indicate the feasibility of incorporating two-way interactions among groundwater, unsaturated soil, and streams into the hydrological components of ESMs and show a further need to explore the implications of these interactions in the context of Earth system dynamics."

However, the vast area of the ocean and budgetary constraints make conducting comprehensive surveys to assess MP pollution impractical. Interpretable machine learning (ML) offers an effective solution. Herein, we used four ML algorithms based on MP data calibrated to the size range of 20–5000 μm and considered various factors to construct a robust predictive ML model of marine MP distribution. Interpretation of the ML model indicated that biogeochemical and anthropogenic factors substantially influence global marine MP pollution, while atmospheric and physical factors exert lesser effects. However, the extent of the influence of each factor may vary within specific marine regions and their underlying mechanisms may differ across regions. The predicted results indicated that the global marine MP concentrations ranged from 0.176 to 27.055 particles/m3 and that MPs in the 20–5000-μm size range did not pose a potential ecological risk. The interpretable ML framework developed in this study covered MP data preprocessing, MP distribution prediction, and interpretation of the influencing factors of MPs, providing an essential reference for marine MP pollution management and decision making."

In this study, peracetic acid (PAA) was employed in combination with natural protocatechuic acid (PCA) to remove sulfonamide antibiotics (SAs) from water. More than 95% removal of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and other SAs was observed in the PCA/PAA system, and neutral pH conditions (5.0–8.0) were more conducive to the removal of SMX. The PCA/PAA system exhibited a great anti-interference ability against complex water matrices. ortho-Quinone, generated from the oxidation of PCA by PAA, played a dominant role in the SMX removal. Electrons tended to transfer from SMX to the generated ortho-quinones and form covalent bonds, resulting in the production of less toxic oligomers via the overlooked polymerization pathway. A reduction in the toxicity of the SMX solution was found following treatment with the PCA/PAA system. More interestingly, several polyphenols structurally related to PCA could also facilitate SMX removal using PAA as the oxidant. Overall, this study proposes a novel strategy for developing reactive quinones dominated AOPs with robust anti-interference performance, as well as enhances the understanding of contaminant removal via an overlooked polymerization pathway in natural polyphenol-related AOPs."

These findings suggest significant anthropogenic contributions (MTANT), challenging the traditional view that MT emissions are predominantly natural (MTNAT) in current inventories. This oversight likely results in a substantial underestimation of MT’s role in urban ozone (O3) production. Therefore, we developed a novel approach to generate a gridded emission inventory (EI) of MTANT, integrating flux measurements of MT and carbon monoxide (CO). Results show that MTANT emission rate in Beijing core areas exceeds MTNAT by a factor of 1.83, with household volatile chemical products (VCPs) contributing 56% of total MTANT emissions. Incorporating MTANT emissions into the Weather Research and Forecasting Model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model significantly improved the simulation of diurnal MT variations (correlation coefficient, r = 0.985) and reduced the normalized mean bias (NMB) in surface MT concentration predictions by 53%. Notably, the combined effects of anthropogenic and biogenic MT emissions increased summertime maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O3 levels by 12.8 ppb in Beijing core areas, with MT from household VCPs (MTVCP) accounting for 62% of the MTANT-driven O3 increase.

PAHs are toxic to microorganisms and pose ecological risks. Bacteria encode enzymes for PAH degradation through specific genes, thereby mitigating PAH pollution. However, due to PAHs’ complexity, information on the global degradation potential, diversity, and associated risks of PAH-degrading microbes in soils is lacking. In this study, we analyzed 121 PAH-degrading genes and selected 33 as marker genes to predict the degradation potential within the soil microbiome. By constructing a Hidden Markov Model, we identified 4990 species carrying PAH-degrading genes in 40,039 soil metagenomic assembly genomes, with Burkholderiaceae and Stellaceae emerging as high-potential degraders. We demonstrated that the candidate PAH degraders predominantly emerged in artificial soil and farmland, with significantly fewer present in extreme environments, driven by factors such as average annual rainfall, organic carbon, and human modification of terrestrial systems. Furthermore, we comprehensively quantified the potential risks of each potential host in future practical applications using three indicators (antibiotic resistance genes, virulence factors, and pathogenic bacteria). We found that the degrader Stellaceae has significant application prospects. Our research will help determine the biosynthetic potential of PAH-degrading enzymes globally and further identify potential PAH-degrading bacteria at lower risk."

In this Perspective, we summarize these discrepancies and prior explanations provided for their occurrence. Through modeling using two linear free energy relationships (i.e., the Swain–Scott and the Bro̷nsted relationships), we propose a simple but overlooked alternative explanation─namely, that hydrolysis reactions are often much more sensitive to constituents in laboratory buffers than often assumed. We suggest that buffers employed in standard practices (e.g., at 50 mM or higher concentrations recommended by regulatory guidelines) are expected to significantly catalyze many hydrolysis reactions by acting as nucleophiles or bases.

In this study, we explored the gut and liver toxicity caused by the overflow of Cu(I) at low doses of Cu exposure. Here, we first elucidated the digestive and metabolic systems as the main toxic target sites by a systematic epidemiological analysis. Then, ICP-MS analysis verified that the gut and liver were the top two Cu-high-accumulated organs in zebrafish exposed to 10 and 100 μg/L waterborne Cu for 72 h. In-situ Cu(I) and Cu(II) imaging techniques demonstrated that exogenous Cu(II) was converted to Cu(I) in the zebrafish gut. Furthermore, transcriptomic sequencing revealed that the high overflow of Cu(I) induced gut toxicity by cell cycle arrest in the G phase. However, the substantial accumulation of Cu(I) disrupted the metabolism of energy source nutrients and energy supply, leading to hepatic toxicity. This study provides new insights into the toxic mechanism based on Cu redox state and emphasizes the health risks associated with Cu exposure in the digestive and metabolic systems."

Overall, BIB methods outperformed ESB methods across general criteria, especially in robustness (95% higher). BIB methods assess biodiversity impacts based on land management intensity levels, whereas ESB methods emphasize specific land management practices. Neither approach fully captures biodiversity impacts across supply chains. For future studies, it is advisable to (1) model the direct (on-farm) impacts of land management change at the midpoint level; (2) establish cause-effect relationships between key land management practices and biodiversity indicators, while distinguishing between direct (on-site) and indirect (off-site) biodiversity impacts resulting from land management change; (3) characterize land-use intensity levels with specific land management practices and include the positive impacts from agroecological practices.

 The gastrointestinal tract is continuously exposed to foreign antigens in food and commensal microbes with potential to induce adaptive immune responses. Peripherally induced T regulatory (pTreg) cells are essential for mitigating inflammatory responses to these agents1–4. While RORγt+ antigen-presenting cells (RORγt-APCs) were shown to program gut microbiota-specific pTreg5–7, their definition remains incomplete, and the APC responsible for food tolerance has remained elusive. Here, we identify an APC subset required for differentiation of both food- and microbiota-specific pTreg cells and for establishment of oral tolerance. Development and function of these APCs require expression of the transcription factors Prdm16 and RORγt, as well as a unique Rorc(t) cis-regulatory element. Gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and surface marker analysis establish the pTreg-inducing APCs as myeloid in origin, distinct from ILC3, and sharing epigenetic profiles with classical dendritic cells (cDC), and designate them Prdm16+ RORγt+ tolerizing DC (tolDC). Upon genetic perturbation of tolDC, we observe a substantial increase in food antigen-specific T helper 2 (Th2) cells in lieu of pTreg, leading to compromised tolerance in mouse models of asthma and food allergy. Single-cell analyses of freshly resected mesenteric lymph nodes from a human organ donor, as well as multiple specimens of human intestine and tonsil, reveal candidate tolDC with co-expression of PRDM16 and RORC and an extensive transcriptome shared with mice, highlighting an evolutionarily conserved role across species. Our findings suggest that a better understanding of how tolDC develop and how they regulate T cell responses to food and microbial antigens could offer new insights into developing therapeutic strategies for autoimmune and allergic diseases as well as organ transplant tolerance."

 Reactive capture – the integration of CO2 capture with electrochemical upgrade – offers the prospect of improving overall energy efficiency in captured-CO2-to-fuels by eliminating the gas-phase CO2 desorption step, and by further offering a CO2-free gas product stream. Two related challenges limit the potential impact of electrified reactive capture today: its propensity to produce lower-value C1 products (carbon products containing one carbon atom per molecule); and its failure to retain performance when fed dilute streams (e.g. ~1-10% CO2). We posit that these could be addressed using catalysts that locally concentrate and activate in-situ generated CO2: we integrate a redox-active polymeric network whose polymer fragments undergo reversible reduction during the electrochemical conversion process, enabling electron transfer to CO2 molecules generated in-situ from carbonate capture liquid. We report as a result a 55 ± 5% C2+ (carbon products containing two or more carbon atoms per molecule) Faradaic efficiency (FE) at 300 mA/cm2 in an electrochemical reactive capture system in which the electrolysis stage is fed with 1 M K2CO3. We obtain 56 ± 4 wt% C2H4 in the product gas stream. When we use a dilute stream consisting of 1% CO2 in N2 at the KOH capture stage, we retain the C2+ FE to within 85% (relative) of its value achieved in the case of pure CO2.

Implications in neutrophil activity, inflammatory protein levels (e.g., IL1RL1), and biological pathways of immune functions are also explored. 
 Infants with severe bronchiolitis (i.e., bronchiolitis requiring hospitalization) face increased risks of respiratory diseases in childhood. We conduct epigenome-wide association studies in a multi-ethnic cohort of these infants. We identify 61 differentially methylated regions in infant blood (<1 year of age) associated with recurrent wheezing by age 3 (170 cases, 318 non-cases) and/or asthma by age 6 (112 cases, 394 non-cases). These differentially methylated regions are enriched in the enhancers of peripheral blood neutrophils. Several differentially methylated regions exhibit interaction with rhinovirus infection and/or specific blood cell types. In the same blood samples, circulating levels of 104 proteins correlate with the differentially methylated regions, and many proteins show phenotypic association with asthma. Through Mendelian randomization, we find causal evidence supporting a protective role of higher plasma ST2 (also known as IL1RL1) protein against asthma. DNA methylation is also associated with ST2 protein level in infant blood.

 Van der Waals moiré heterostructure have been found to exhibits a robust interfacial ferroelectricity down to atomic thickness, and discovering and understanding the complex polarization state in moiré systems is of fundamental interest to condensed-matter research. In this study, we examine the moiré ferroelectricity in twisted h-BN heterostructure by piezoresponse force microscopy. Due to atomic reconstruction, triangular moiré patterns are detected, and we directly observe sliding ferroelectricity in the center of triangular moiré patterns as well as robust in-plane polarization topology emerging at the boundary of adjacent triangles, which we call edge polarization. The edge polarization possesses non-trivial and robust vortex polarization topology. Our calculations trace the origin of this phenomenon to joined piezoelectric effects with sliding ferroelectricity. This work provides intuitive insights to explore the unique moiré ferroelectricity in non-polar background matrix, and the inherent stability of the topological structures ensures reliable and durable performance of electronic devices.

 Dysregulated protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway can induce numerous disease phenotypes, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and diabetes. While small molecule-based targeted protein degradation (TPD) and targeted protein stabilization (TPS) platforms can address this dysregulation, they rely on structured and stable binding pockets, which do not exist to classically “undruggable” targets. Here, we expand the TPS target space by engineering “deubiquibodies” (duAbs) via fusion of computationally-designed peptide binders to the catalytic domain of the potent OTUB1 deubiquitinase. In human cells, duAbs effectively stabilize exogenous and endogenous proteins in a DUB-dependent manner. Using protein language models to generate target-binding peptides, we engineer duAbs to conformationally diverse target proteins, including key tumor suppressor proteins p53 and WEE1, and heavily-disordered fusion oncoproteins, such as PAX3::FOXO1. We further encapsulate p53-targeting duAbs as mRNA in lipid nanoparticles and demonstrate effective intracellular delivery, p53 stabilization, and apoptosis activation, motivating further in vivo translation.

Here, the authors show that MGAT1 modulation of CD73 glycosylation and function regulates tumor immune response in triple-negative breast cancer. 
 Despite the widespread application of immunotherapy, treating immune-cold tumors remains a significant challenge in cancer therapy. Using multiomic spatial analyses and experimental validation, we identify MGAT1, a glycosyltransferase, as a pivotal factor governing tumor immune response. Overexpression of MGAT1 leads to immune evasion due to aberrant elevation of CD73 membrane translocation, which suppresses CD8+ T cell function, especially in immune-cold triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Mechanistically, addition of N-acetylglucosamine to CD73 by MGAT1 enables the CD73 dimerization necessary for CD73 loading onto VAMP3, ensuring membrane fusion. We further show that THBS1 is an upstream etiological factor orchestrating the MGAT1-CD73-VAMP3-adenosine axis in suppressing CD8+ T cell antitumor activity. Spatial transcriptomic profiling reveals spatially resolved features of interacting malignant and immune cells pertaining to expression levels of MGAT1 and CD73. In preclinical models of TNBC, W-GTF01, an inhibitor specifically blocked the MGAT1-catalyzed CD73 glycosylation, sensitizing refractory tumors to anti-PD-L1 therapy via restoring capacity to elicit a CD8+ IFNγ-producing T cell response. Collectively, our findings uncover a strategy for targeting the immunosuppressive molecule CD73 by inhibiting MGAT1.

 Ferroptosis, a form of cell death instigated by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation reactions (LPO), is emerging as a promising therapeutic target for cancer. While the mechanisms governing LPO induction and suppression have gradually been unveiled, questions persist regarding the specific cellular location of LPO and the utilization of iron in driving cell death. A comprehensive understanding of these aspects holds significant potential for advancing therapeutic applications in disease management. Here, we show lysosomal LPO in the initiation of ferroptosis, leveraging the hidden abilities of fluorescent detection probes. Intra-lysosomal LPO triggers iron leakage, fostering cell-wide LPO by augmenting lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP). Conversely, cell lines with low susceptibility to ferroptosis do not exhibit LMP. This deficiency is rectified by the concurrent administration of chloroquine, leading to LMP induction and subsequent cell death. These findings underscore enhancing LMP induction efficacy as a strategic approach to surmount resistance to therapies in cancer. The early events in ferroptosis are not clear.

 High-temperature exposure has important implications for mental and behavioural disorders (MBDs), which could lead to increased risks under climate change.

 The sea ice variabilities in West Antarctica, crucial for both local and global climate systems, are profoundly affected by the sea surface temperature anomalies over the tropical Atlantic. Analyses based on observational data and numerical model experiments demonstrate that the two recently identified Atlantic Niño types, central and eastern Atlantic Niño (CAN and EAN), have distinct impacts on the sea ice concentration in West Antarctica. The CAN stimulates two atmospheric Rossby wave trains in the Southern Hemisphere through both direct and indirect pathways, collectively strengthening the Amundsen Sea Low. In contrast, the EAN only excites one atmospheric wave train over the South Pacific through an indirect pathway, due to its associated weaker local Hadley circulation, which fails to establish a significant Rossby wave source in the subtropical South Atlantic. Consequently, compared to the EAN, the atmospheric circulation and the associated sea ice concentration anomalies in West Antarctica during the CAN are stronger and more extensive. Therefore, distinguishing between the two Atlantic Niño types could potentially enhance the seasonal prediction capabilities for sea ice concentration in West Antarctica."

Yet, unlike tropical cyclone (TC) activity forecasting, no attempt has been made for seasonal prediction of Indian monsoon ERE frequency and ERA. Here, we establish that the seasonal prediction of ERE frequency during Indian monsoon is associated with the global El Niño-Southern Oscillation (G-ENSO) in a manner similar to the Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR). We develop a deep learning model trained on the physical relationship between seasonal frequency of ERE and G-ENSO from an ensemble of Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) for skillful seasonal forecast of ERE frequency at one-month lead. Integrating such seasonal forecasts of ERE frequency with ISMR seasonal forecast system is likely to be critical in disaster preparedness and loss minimization against increasing threat of ERE frequency damages in coming decades."

 Despite advancements in understanding the rupture processes and surface deformations of the 2023 Türkiye earthquake doublet, their seismogenic mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we employed a joint tomographic method utilizing 215,906 P- and S-wave arrival time pairs to determine the fine-scale seismic and porosity structures in the rupture zones. We find that the first Mw 7.8 earthquake occurred in a brittle or near-brittle structure zone with low porosity and fluid saturation, offering a potential condition for brittle failure with supershear rupture. By contrast, the second Mw 7.6 quake initiated in a ductile belt characterized by high porosity and fluid saturation, explaining the observed sub-shear rupture behaviors. The former induces large decreasing normal stress, thus opening the Çardak fault, accelerating the migration of saturated fluids towards the fault zone through intra-crustal faults and extended cracks, increasing pore pressure, and delaying triggering a second earthquake. Our findings reveal the diverse seismogenic mechanisms of the Türkiye earthquake doublet, suggesting that fluid intrusion may have played a crucial role in triggering the second Mw 7.6 quake.

 Satellite altimetry has become an indispensable technique for large-scale monitoring of inland water levels, which is fundamental to understanding the hydrologic dynamics of surface water and informed water resource management in the scenario of changing climate. Yet the capacity of inland altimetry can be further improved regarding the accuracy and the spatial-temporal coverage of water level estimates. This study presents a new Multiple Persistent Peaks (MPP) retracker to improve the retrieval of inland water levels from satellite radar altimetry. Focusing on the long-term Jason-2/3 observations, we demonstrate how the MPP retracker works in the case of complex and multipeaked waveforms commonly encountered in inland radar altimetry. The MPP retracker determines surface elevations of the target water body by grouping and multi-objective analysis of multiple along-track height profiles corresponding to persistent peaks in the aligned averaged waveform. We evaluated the results globally at 41 gauge stations and 6 crossovers with various climate, terrain, and hydrologic settings. The root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of the altimetry-derived water levels with in situ measurements is between 0.19 m and 0.78 m (median value of 0.38 m) and within the range of 0.25–0.49 m at crossovers. The validations show that the new automated method outperforms classical retrackers in terms of accuracy and robustness and is applicable to both pulse-limited and SAR altimetry. Our approach successfully retrieved good quality water level time series at river reaches with highly heterogeneous landscapes where most retrackers exhibit errors of several meters. Based on the MPP retracker, we provided an efficient tool for sophisticated outliers filtering and correction in the final time series, which is desirable for expert evaluation and improving the quality of altimetry-derived water level products.

Derivations of fractional cover from spectral unmixing algorithms have provided insights into various ecosystem functions. In the case of EMIT, they will be used by multiple global Earth systems models to constrain the sign of dust-related radiative forcing. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of different approaches for estimating fractional cover and quantifying the corresponding uncertainty, and serves as a model to encapsulate the true error budget for EMIT. We simulated surface reflectance from a spectral library compiled from various drylands to generate millions of candidate spectra made up of different random fractions of nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV), green vegetation (GV), and soil. Simulated spectra were used as-is but we also tested the impact of atmospheric conditions/surface reflectance retrieval by using them to calculate top-of-atmosphere radiance then using the current EMIT surface reflectance retrieval algorithm to estimate apparent surface reflectance. We tested approaches to unmixing these simulated spectra using multiple strategies for dealing with spectrum brightness, within-class spectral variability, and library selection. We also incorporated a Monte Carlo approach to stabilize fractional cover retrievals and quantify uncertainty. The best spectral unmixing approaches produced mean absolute error < 0.10 for NPV and soil and < 0.06 for GV with uncertainties ≤± 0.02 for all classes.

 Recent advancements in data storage and computing, particularly cloud-based processing, enable mapping global land cover and change relatively quickly and easily.

Sample-based validation is then required to establish correspondence between these map prototypes and the real world, thus turning them from algorithm data outputs into sources of information with quantified errors.

We provide a unified set of estimators that accommodate a variety of sampling designs by explicitly accounting for the area of each sample unit, as well as code and technical details necessary to implement the presented methods.

 Up-to-date mapping of built-up areas is of paramount importance for urban planning, environmental monitoring, and disaster management. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in employing supervised machine learning and deep learning methods to map built-up areas using satellite SAR and optical data. However, the laborious and expensive task of gathering and maintaining a vast array of diverse training data poses a challenge to the widespread adoption of these methods for large-scale built-up area mapping. This paper presents a two-step framework enabling an automated extraction of built-up areas using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. Initially, training data for built-up and non-built-up classes are automatically sampled and labeled from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data for a given area of interest. Subsequently, a cross-fusion neural network is trained using the samples from the first step to produce a built-up map for the entire study area. To enhance the network’s resilience to label noise, a contextual virtual adversarial training (CVAT) regularization is introduced within the mean-teacher architecture. Our proposed framework was tested on 48 different study areas across the world. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate its robustness and effectiveness for large-scale built-up area extraction. The versatility of our framework in generating accurate and up-to-date built-up information, which is essential for monitoring urban environments and assessing economic losses resulting from natural disasters, is highlighted through comparisons with four state-of-the-art global built-up products: Global Human Settlement Built-up map based on 2018 Sentinel-2 composites (GHS-BUILT-S2), World Settlement Footprint 2019 (WSF 2019), ESA World Cover, and Dynamic World."

 Investigations into the characteristics and phase-partitioning behavior of alkylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (alkyl-PAHs) during coal combustion process remain notably limited. This study aims to analyze the source characteristics, distribution patterns, and partitioning mechanisms of parent and alkyl-PAHs in gas and particle phase emissions from coal combustion. The results show that 30.77 %–49.37 % of parent PAHs from coking, gas, lean and fat coal combustion emissions are distributed in gas phases, while it accounts for 78.59 % in lignite coal combustion emission. In terms of alkyl-PAHs, 79.05 %–89.45 % of coking, gas and lean coal combustion emissions are presented in particle phases, and 62.66 %–69.32 % of lignite and fat coal combustion emissions are presented in gas phases. Moreover, the PAH p-values from coal combustion emissions are in the range of −1.00 to −0.68, and the alkylated ones range from −0.80 to −0.54. Interestingly, alkylated phenanthrenes maintain a high degree of uniformity in the distribution patterns of combustion emissions, and their bell-shape distribution pattern performs to be a potential indicator of coal combustion. Furthermore, by employing partitioning models, it can be proven that absorption and adsorption are governing PAH partitioning mechanisms, and alkyl-PAHs can reach equilibrium more rapidly than parent PAHs. These findings offer detailed data into source analysis and the fate of alkyl-PAHs from coal combustion, which is expected to be helpful for environmental behavior investigation and better pollution control of coal combustion."

 Atmospheric aerosol is an essential component of the atmosphere, with a significant radiative forcing impact. Aerosol influences the processes of radiation transmission, energy cycle, climate change and Earth-atmosphere interaction, and it is inextricably linked to environmental protection and human health. As coarse mode dominant absorptive particles, dust aerosol has a complex effect on climate (cooling in shortwave and warming in longwave) and is easy to cause human respiratory diseases. In this study, the Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties (GRASP) algorithm, which supports simultaneous retrieval of multiple aerosol optical and microphysical parameters with measurements from different sources and levels, is applied to the Directional Polarimetric Camera (DPC) measurements on board the Chinese Gaofen-5 (02) satellite. The optical and microphysical properties of aerosols in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from April to June in 2023 are obtained, and a dust event is tracked. The results show that DPC/GRASP method is capable to retrieve aerosol optical and microphysical properties in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, and is highly correlated with AERONET, and can be used to identify the evolution process of dust weather. It provides a new method and process scheme for the efficient and accurate acquisition of aerosol optical and microphysical properties in large areas by integrating various aerosol observation platform data in the future, and provides a new reference for the study of the evolution of dust weather and the diffusion of dust aerosol."
10.1016/j.atmosenv.2025.121206,True,Atmospheric Environment,该研究论文探讨了在中国未来气候和植被变化背景下，生物源排放对地表臭氧的影响。论文利用生物排放和地球化学模型，评估了不同区域（如京津冀、山东等地）在2030年和2060年气候情景下，植被变化对臭氧污染的影响。研究发现，气候变暖会增强生物源排放对地表臭氧的贡献，尤其是在氮肥使用量较高的华北地区，生物氮氧化物的作用更为显著。虽然生物挥发性有机物（BVOCs）的增加会提高RO2自由基的浓度，但其对臭氧的影响取决于氮氧化物（NOx）的水平。在高NOx地区，BVOCs通过RO2+NO反应促进臭氧生成；而在NOx稀缺地区，RO2+HO2反应占主导，通过竞争效应减少臭氧。这项研究强调了生物源排放在中国未来臭氧污染中的关键作用，与大气环境遥感技术中的空气质量监测和大气成分分析密切相关。,"['surface ozone', 'biogenic emissions', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'climate change', 'vegetation changes', 'ozone source apportionment']",Wenpeng Wang;Ying Wang;Xiangyue Chen;Xiaodong Zhang;Tan Xu;Yuan Zhao;Lei Ma;Bolong Chen;Hongchao Zuo,The future underlying differential response of surface ozone to biogenic emissions in China (2019–2060),"•China's surface ozone were predicted based on future climate and vegetation changes. •Climate warming enhances the contribution of biogenic emissions to surface ozone. •Future surface ozone in North China is increase due to higher fertilizer application. •Surface ozone declines with BVOCs enhancement in urban areas as P(H2O2)/P(HNO3) >9. 
 China's major megacity clusters experience severe summer ozone pollution, posing significant public health risks. In the context of declining anthropogenic emissions and increasing biogenic emissions driven by climate warming, understanding future surface ozone trends and their response to biogenic emissions is critical. This study integrates advanced biogenic emission and geochemical models to assess the impact of vegetation changes on ozone pollution in key regions—Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (JJJ), Shandong (SDC), Chengdu-Chongqing (CCC), Fenwei Plain (FWP), Mid-Yangtze (MYC), Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GHM), and Yangtze River Delta (YRD)—under 2030 and 2060 climate scenarios. Results demonstrate intensified ozone pollution by 2030 in GHM, MYC, FWP, and SDC, and by 2060 in JJJ, FWP, and GHM. The Random Forest model attributes ∼76.0 % of future ozone changes to biogenic emissions. Ozone source apportionment (OSAT) and brute force (BF) methods reveal increasing biogenic contributions to ozone formation in most scenarios. Mechanistic analysis shows biological nitrogen oxides (BNOx) play a larger role than biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), especially in northern China with high nitrogen fertilizer use. While rising BVOCs increase RO2 radicals, their ozone impact depends on NOx levels: in NOx-rich regions, BVOCs promote ozone via RO2+NO reactions; in NOx-scarce regions, RO2+HO2 reactions dominate, reducing ozone through competitive effects. This effect is observed in megacity clusters when P(H2O2)/P(HNO3) exceeds 9. Overall, this study highlights the pivotal role of biogenic emissions in shaping China's future ozone pollution under climate and vegetation changes."

 Atmospheric hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an important oxidant in the troposphere that impacts atmospheric oxidation capacity and plays key roles in S(IV) oxidation. In the past decade, researchers have proposed new H2O2 formation mechanisms as well as its significant environmental effects, based on field measurements, laboratory experiments, and modeling. However, these unconventional chemical processes related to atmospheric H2O2 have not been systematically reviewed, previous reviews on atmospheric H2O2 were published in the early 2000s. Herein, we review the recent atmospheric H2O2 studies throughout the world, mainly focusing on the observations, sources, and environmental effects of atmospheric H2O2. First, we summarize the temporal and vertical distributions of atmospheric H2O2 across urban, rural, mountainous, forested, and oceanic regions, as well as the upper atmosphere. Next, we discuss recent advancements in understanding potential sources of atmospheric H2O2 and its multiphase formation mechanisms. Finally, the increasing environmental effects of atmospheric H2O2, including its role in diagnosis of O3-NOx-VOCs sensitivity and significance in sulfate formation, are outlined. This review will help gain a comprehensive understanding of atmospheric H2O2 evolution and call for more future studies on atmospheric H2O2 to better deal with the current complex air pollution challenges."

 The Global Dimming and Brightening (GDB) phenomenon plays an important role in the Earth's climate, with clouds and aerosols being the major drivers. This study investigates GDB causes by quantifying the contributions of changes in clouds, aerosols, water vapor and ozone to the surface solar radiation (SSR) changes during 1984–2018. To this aim, radiative transfer calculations were performed by the FORTH-RTM (Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas Radiative Transfer Model) on a monthly basis and 0.5°x0.625° spatial resolution using modern and improved datasets for clouds and aerosols. Validation against high-quality ground measurements confirmed RTM's reliability. Results show a global mean brightening of 0.88 Wm−2decade−1 from 1984 to 2018, stronger over land (2.57 Wm−2decade−1) than oceans (0.19 Wm−2decade−1). Globally, changes in clouds (especially middle-level cloud amount (CA) and high-level cloud optical thickness (COT)) were the main GDB drivers. However, the contribution of aerosol optical depth (AOD) changes was remarkable over specific land areas with strong anthropogenic activity, such as Europe, India and East China. In the 80's and 90's changes in AOD were the main GDB driver, subsequently in the 2000s high-level cloud optical thickness contributed the most to GDB followed by the AOD changes, while finally in the 2010s both clouds and AOD had comparable contributions. Over land, AOD had a comparable contribution to GDB with that of clouds whereas the contribution of aerosols' asymmetry parameter (AP) and single scattering albedo (SSA), water vapor and ozone was quite small or insignificant."
