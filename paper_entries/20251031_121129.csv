10.5194/acp-25-14221-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文介绍了一个名为GAW-QC的交互式仪表板，旨在对全球大气观测（GAW）网络中地面站进行的大气成分原位测量进行质量控制。该仪表板主要面向站点操作员，用于分析最新的、尚未发布的数据，但也允许任何人使用多种异常检测算法和可视化比较来验证已发布数据的质量。该工具能够处理甲烷、一氧化碳、二氧化碳、一氧化二氮和臭氧等痕量气体的测量数据，并提供统计和可视化辅助，以帮助用户识别问题数据。虽然该论文侧重于地面原位测量，但其核心目标是提高大气成分数据的质量，这与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）密切相关，因为高质量的地面数据对于验证和校准遥感数据至关重要。,"['atmospheric composition', 'in-situ measurements', 'quality control', 'trace gases', 'methane (CH4)', 'carbon monoxide (CO)', 'carbon dioxide (CO2)', 'nitrous oxide (N2O)', 'ozone (O3)', 'anomaly detection']",Yuri Brugnara;Martin Steinbacher;Simone Baffelli;Lukas Emmenegger,Technical note: An interactive dashboard  to facilitate quality control of in-situ  atmospheric composition measurements,"GAW-QC (Global Atmosphere Watch-Quality Control) is an interactive dashboard for the quality control of in-situ atmospheric composition measurements made at stations taking part in the Global Atmosphere Watch network. Even though it is mainly targeted at station operators who want to analyze recent, not yet published measurements, it allows anybody to verify the quality of already published measurements using various anomaly detection algorithms as well as visual comparisons. 
 In-situ measurements of trace gases are crucial for monitoring changes in the atmosphere's composition and understanding the underlying processes that drive them. For over three decades, the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) programme of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has coordinated a network of surface monitoring stations and facilities with the goal of providing high-quality atmospheric composition measurements worldwide. One of the critical challenges towards this goal is the spatially unbalanced availability of high-quality time series, and the lack of near-realtime quality control (QC) procedures that would allow the prompt detection of unreliable data. Here, we describe an interactive dashboard designed for GAW station operators, but which may be of much wider use, that is able to flag anomalous values in near-realtime or historical data. The dashboard combines three distinct algorithms that identify anomalous measurements: (i) an outlier detection based on the Subsequence Local Outlier Factor (Sub-LOF) method, (ii) a comparison with numerical forecasts coupled with a machine learning model, and (iii) a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) regression model. The application, called GAW-QC, can process measurements of methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and ozone (O3) at hourly resolution, offering multiple statistical and visual aids to help users to identify problematic data. By enhancing QC capabilities, GAW-QC contributes to the GAW programme's goal of providing reliable atmospheric measurements worldwide."

We find a good complementarity between the two approaches, with the combined product leading to the overall best fit to observations, and arguably most realistic wetland CH4 emission estimate. 
 Atmospheric inverse modelling and ecosystem data assimilation are two complementary approaches to estimate CH4 emissions. The inverse approach infers emission estimates from observed atmospheric CH4 mixing ratio, which provide robust large scale constraints on total methane emissions, but with poor spatial and process resolution. On the other hand, in the ecosystem data assimilation approach, the fit of an ecosystem model (e.g. a Dynamic Global Vegetation Model, DGVM) to eddy-covariance (EC) flux measurements is used to optimize model parameters, leading to more realistic emission estimates.Coupled data assimilation frameworks capable of assimilating both atmospheric and ecosystem observations have been shown to work for estimating CO2 emissions, however ecosystem data assimilation for estimation CH4 emissions is relatively new. Kallingal et al. (2024a) developed the GRaB-AM data assimilation system, which performs a parameter optimization of the LPJ-GUESS against eddy-covariance estimation of CH4 emissions. The optimization improves the fit to EC data, but the validity of the estimate at large scale remained to be tested.In this study, we confronted CH4 emissions optimized using the GRaB-AM system to atmospheric CH4 observations and to emission estimates from the LUMIA regional atmospheric inversion system (Monteil and Scholze, 2021). We  found that the two approaches lead to very consistent corrections to the prior emission estimate from natural wetlands, with roughly a halving of the annual total compared to the LPJ-GUESS prior. Our findings confirm the interest of the GRaB-AM approach to constrain the contribution of natural ecosystems to the total methane budget, which is difficult to achieve for atmospheric inversions outside regions where emissions from natural ecosystems clearly dominate the emission budget."
10.5194/acp-25-14187-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文利用TROPOMI卫星数据，通过反演方法评估了2022-2023年俄乌战争期间乌克兰人为氮氧化物（NOx）排放的变化。研究发现，战争导致乌克兰NOx排放显著下降，尤其是在东部战区。工业部门排放降幅最大，而战争活动本身也产生NOx，部分抵消了减排效果。研究结果揭示了冲突对社会经济活动和空气污染的破坏性影响，属于大气环境遥感技术在空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析方面的应用。,"['NOx emission', 'TROPOMI', 'air quality monitoring', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'anthropogenic emissions', 'nitrogen dioxide (NO2)']",Yu Mao;Weimin Ju;Hengmao Wang;Liangyun Liu;Haikun Wang;Shuzhuang Feng;Mengwei Jia;Fei Jiang,Inversion-based assessment of anthropogenic NOx emission changes in Ukraine during the 2022–2023 war using TROPOMI satellite data,"The Russia-Ukraine war caused significant NOx emission reductions in Ukraine, exceeding COVID-19 impacts. Using TROPOMI data, we found a 15% drop in 2022 and 8% in 2023, with Eastern Ukraine (frontline) seeing declines of 29% and 17%. Industry emissions fell most (34% in 2022), while war-related NOx partially offset reductions (8-10%). Emissions closely tracked military actions, revealing conflict’s disruptive effects on socio-economic activity and air pollution. 
 The outbreak of the Russia–Ukraine war in 2022 brought a huge impact on the Ukrainian society. We utilized TROPOMI nitrogen dioxide (NO2) observations to constrain the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) inventory and inverted daily anthropogenic nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions in Ukraine from 2019 to 2023. Our results reveal a 15 % reduction in NOx emissions during the 2022 war and an 8 % reduction in 2023, both substantially exceeding the decrease caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Emission anomalies closely tracked the timing and location of major military actions, highlighting the sensitivity of NOx emissions to conflict-related disruptions. Regionally, Eastern Ukraine experienced larger reductions in NOx emissions in both 2022 and 2023 by 29 % and 17 %, respectively, due to direct damage from frontline military operations. In contrast, Western Ukraine experienced a relatively modest emission reduction of only 8 % in 2022 with emissions increasing in some regions. In 2023, the emissions increased in most western regions. After the outbreak of the war, the industrial sector experienced the largest reductions in NOx emissions, with decreases of 34 % and 24 % in 2022 and 2023, respectively, followed by the residential sector, which declined by 23 % and 18 % respectively. War activities also emitted large amounts of NOx, and such emissions partially offset the emission reduction caused by the impact of war on socio-economic. By filtering out high-frequency emission fluctuations induced by wartime activities through Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing, our results indicate that war-related emissions may have offset approximately 8 % and 10 % of the anthropogenic NOx reductions in 2022 and 2023, respectively. After removing the war-related emissions, the inverted emission declines exhibit strong agreement with bottom-up emission inventories and reported economic performance metrics. These findings provide new insights into the environmental and socio-economic impacts of armed conflict."
10.5194/acp-25-14131-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文评估了使用双单色仪和单单色仪 Brewer 分光光度计测量的光谱紫外辐照度的不确定性。虽然论文重点在于仪器校准和不确定性分析，但紫外辐射的测量与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为紫外辐射是大气成分分析和空气质量监测的重要参数。Brewer 仪器常用于监测大气中的臭氧和其他吸收紫外线的物质，因此与大气成分分析相关。通过精确测量紫外辐照度，可以推断出大气成分的变化，从而用于空气质量评估和气候变化研究。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术具有较强的相关性。,"['UV irradiance', 'Brewer spectrophotometer', 'Uncertainty analysis', 'Solar zenith angle', 'Atmospheric composition', 'Air quality monitoring']",Carmen González;José M.

Smedley;Pavel Babal;Ana Díaz;Nis Jepsen;Guisella Gacitúa;Antonio Serrano,Evaluation of the uncertainty of the spectral UV irradiance measured by double- and single-monochromator Brewer spectrophotometers,"Brewer spectroradiometers are widely used instruments that have been monitoring global solar ultraviolet (UV) irradiance since the 1990s, playing a key role in solar UV research. The uncertainties of these measurements are rarely evaluated even though they are essential to determine the quality of these measurements. In this work, the uncertainty of 10 Brewers is estimated using the Monte Carlo method, showing that Brewers’ relative uncertainty is less than 5 % for wavelengths above 310 nm. 
 Brewer instruments are robust, widely used instruments that have been monitoring global solar ultraviolet (UV) irradiance since the 1990s, playing a key role in UV research. Unfortunately, the uncertainties of these measurements are rarely evaluated due to the difficulties involved in characterising the instruments. This evaluation is essential to determine the quality of the measurements as well as their comparability to other datasets. In this study, eight double- and two single-monochromator Brewers are characterised, and the uncertainty of their global UV measurements is estimated using the Monte Carlo method. This methodology is selected because it provides reliable uncertainty estimations and considers the nonlinearity of certain steps in the UV processing algorithm. The combined standard uncertainty depends on the Brewer instrument, varying between 2.5 % and 4 % between 310 and 350 nm. These uncertainties arise primarily from radiometric stability, cosine correction, and the uncertainty of the lamp used during calibration. At shorter wavelengths, the differences between single- and double-monochromator Brewers increase. For example, at 296 nm and a solar zenith angle (SZA) of 40°, the relative uncertainties of single Brewers range between 11 % and 23 %, whereas double Brewers have uncertainties of 3 %–5 %. As the measured wavelength decreases, the correction of stray light (for single Brewers), dark counts, and noise become the dominant sources of uncertainty. These results indicate that the accuracy of fully characterised double Brewers is sufficient for biological studies and trend detection, whereas single Brewers might be limited to wavelengths and SZAs below 305 nm and 70°, respectively."

Flux measurements of CO2 alone cannot be attributed to specific emission sectors, such as road transport or residential heating. We present a model which uses the measured ratios of CO2 to carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) as well as sector-specific reference ratios, to attribute measured fluxes to their emission sectors. 
 Eddy covariance measurement of species that are co-emitted with carbon dioxide (CO2), such as carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides NO and NO2 (NOx), provides an opportunity to attribute a net flux to individual source or sink categories. We present eight months of continuous simultaneous measurements of fluxes (F) of CO2, CO, NOx, methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) from a tall tower (112 m a.g.l.) in Zurich, Switzerland. Median daily fluxes of FCO2 were 1.47 times larger in the winter (November–March) as opposed to summer (August–October) months (10.9 vs. 7.4 µmol m−2 s−1); 1.08 times greater for FCO (30 vs. 28 nmol m−2 s−1); 1.08 times greater for FNOx (14 vs. 13 nmol m−2 s−1); 1.01 times greater for FCH4 (13.5 vs. 13.3 nmol m−2 s−1); and not statistically significantly different for FN2O. Flux ratios of FCO/FCO2 and FNOx/FCO2 are well characterised by inventory emission ratios of stationary combustion and road transport in cold months. In warm months both FCO/FCO2 and FNOx/FCO2 systematically exceed expected inventory ratios during the day, while no statistically significant seasonal difference is observed in FNOx/FCO, indicating biospheric photosynthetic activity. A linear mixing model is proposed and applied to attribute half-hourly FCO2, FCO, and FNOx to stationary combustion and road transport emission categories as well as determine the biospheric FCO2. Flux attribution is reasonable at certain times and from certain wind directions, but over-attributes CO and NOx fluxes to road traffic and CO2 fluxes to stationary combustion, and overestimates photosynthetic CO2 uptake."

Nitric acid (NA) and ammonia (NH3) are key nucleation precursors in the UTLS. This study investigates the IA–NA–NH3 system using a theoretical approach. Our proposed nucleation mechanism highlights the crucial role of NA in IA nucleation, providing molecular-level evidence for the missing sources of IA particles in the UTLS. 
 In the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS), new particles frequently form to seed cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), thereby affecting radiative forcing and global climate. Iodic acid (IA) particles have been widely detected in the UTLS; however, how they form is still largely unknown. Given the abundance of nitric acid (NA) and ammonia (NH3) in the UTLS and their nucleation potential, we explore the influence of NA and NH3 on IA nucleation by quantum chemical calculations and cluster dynamics simulations. The structural analysis indicates that NA and NH3 can cluster with IA via hydrogen bonds, halogen bonds, and electrostatic attractions between ions. The small-sized IA–NA–NH3 clusters have lower free energies than typical sulfuric acid (SA)–NA–NH3 clusters in the upper troposphere, exhibiting greater stability and higher nucleation efficiency. Moreover, the NA-enhanced effect on the established efficient IA–NH3 nucleation is more evident at lower temperatures, especially with richer NA and NH3. In the extremely low-temperature UTLS, the proposed IA–NA–NH3 ternary pathway dominates nucleation, while in the mid-troposphere with higher temperatures, the role of NA is minor due to its rapid evaporation. These findings underscore the important role of NA in iodine particle formation in the UTLS, offering mechanistic insights into the missing secondary particle sources."

POA averages 51 % of marine organic aerosols annually, peaking at 63 % in summer. A support vector regression model, validated via fuzzy clustering and Monte Carlo simulations, identifies seasonal patterns of POA linked to biological activity. We found diverse impacts of marine POA and SOA on the aerosol hygroscopicity and mixing state. 
 Marine primary organic aerosols (POAs) are important components of the marine climate system, regulating solar radiation budget and cloud dynamics. Despite their importance, there is a lack of extensive long-term observations of POA properties, introducing great uncertainty in their parameterization in models. This lack of information originates from the complexity of POA chemical composition, very few long-term high-resolution measurements of clean marine air, and the difficulty in performing source apportionment techniques over a long-term period. In this study, we utilize a comprehensive high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) dataset spanning 1 decade (2009–2018) and introduce a machine learning (ML) approach to distinguish between marine POA and marine secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Results indicate that marine POA concentrations peak during summer months and reach their lowest levels in winter. On average, marine POA constitutes 51 % (ranging from 21 % to 76 %) of the marine organic aerosol (OA) annually and up to 63 % (48 % to 75 %) in summer. With the differentiated POA and SOA, we found diverse impacts of POA and SOA on aerosol hygroscopicity and mixing state. An increase in POA reduces the hygroscopicity and leads to an external state of mixing, while an increase in SOA sustains the relatively high hygroscopicity and leads to internal mixing. This study provides an observational dataset for marine POA and SOA and their diverse impacts on aerosol hygroscopicity, emphasizing a better appreciation of marine POA and SOA to improve the climate projections."

Schuck,The extratropical tropopause – trace gas perspective on tropopause definition choice,"We compared different ways to define the upper barrier of the troposphere in the extra-tropics, the “tropopause”. By analysing ozone distributions sorted by different definitions, we found that the traditional temperature-based tropopause works less well than dynamic or tracer-based definitions. We saw a sharper transition of ozone across the tropopause using a higher value of potential vorticity than often used and recommend this value for future studies of exchange processes in this region. 
 Aircraft measurement campaigns such as IAGOS-CARIBIC and HALO missions are invaluable sources of trace gas observations in the extratropical Upper Troposphere and Lower Stratosphere (exUTLS), providing simultaneous measurements of multiple substances. To contextualise these observations, the use of dynamic coordinate systems such as tropopause-relative coordinates is highly beneficial. Different approaches to define the tropopause are commonly used in studies, based on either differences in chemical composition, dynamical parameters, or temperature gradients between the troposphere and stratosphere. We examine how different tropopause definitions influence the climatology and seasonality of trace gas observations. Meteorological parameters used in this analysis are obtained from ERA5 reanalysis data interpolated to the flight tracks. Our findings indicate that the thermal tropopause results in larger composition variability near the tropopause but shows the sharpest overall transition. Potential-vorticity thresholds of 1.5 or 2.0 PVU result in vertically displaced distributions. The 3.5 PVU threshold best represents the transport barrier as indicated by low variability and strong curvature around the tropopause. Tracer-based tropopauses using O3 or N2O can be used effectively to differentiate between the troposphere and stratosphere without the use of additional model data. A chemical tropopause tied to a mid-latitude ozone climatology was shown to return a meaningful tropopause-relative coordinate. An investigation of individual flights showed that the tropopauses calculated from model data did not represent small-scale structures well, while the “in-situ” chemical tropopauses provided more meaningful results. For the calculations of an N2O-based statistical tropopause, however, the case studies highlighted the importance of carefully setting initial parameters."

A newly implemented contrail cirrus scheme in a double-moment cloud microphysics scheme in climate model realistically reproduces the contrail evolution and provides regional forcing estimates within the range reported by other models. The work highlights the importance of initial contrail characteristics and the need for detailed cloud particle representations in climate model contrail simulations. 
 Contrail cirrus is the largest contributor to aviation effective radiative forcing (ERF), but remains highly uncertain (∼ 70 %). Recent research has highlighted the critical role of cloud microphysical schemes in contrail cirrus climate modelling. In this study, we implement a contrail parameterisation in the double-moment cloud microphysics scheme, Cloud AeroSol Interacting Microphysics (CASIM), within the regional configuration of the UK Met Office Unified Model (UM). We first investigate a contrail cluster model experiment, showing that the simulated contrails retain a high ice crystal number concentration for several hours before declining. Ice water content increases during the early stage of the lifecycle before gradually decreasing. In addition, as the contrail cluster gradually sediments below flight levels, there is an increase in both contrail ice number concentration and water content. We also perform regional simulations over a European domain, estimating a regional annual mean contrail cirrus ERF of 0.93 W m−2, within the range of previous climate modelling estimates. Using a range of initial contrail width, depth and ice crystal size based on contrail observations, we estimate an annual mean European regional contrail cirrus ERF range of 0.19 to 2.80 W m−2. The seasonal cycle of contrail cirrus ERF is mainly driven by the background meteorology and the natural clouds vertical structure. Our study highlights the critical need for double-moment cloud microphysics in global climate models to realistically simulate contrail impacts. Future work should extend the simulation globally and investigate how the use of alternative fuels affects contrail microphysical properties, contrail lifetime, and climate impact."

Loeb,The Component Summation Technique for Measuring Upwelling Longwave Irradiance in the Presence of an Obstruction,"We present a new upwelling longwave (LW) measurement technique that eliminates obstruction influences on pyrgeometers by using an infrared thermometer, downwelling LW pyrgeometer, and air temperature probe. This approach can be implemented at locations with obstruction challenges and verify existing upwelling LW pyrgeometer measurements. Satellite projects like the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System depend on accurate surface measurements to validate their models. 
 The CERES Ocean Validation Experiment (COVE) was an instrument suite  located at the Chesapeake Light Station approximately 25 km east of Virginia Beach, Virginia (36.9° N, 75.7° W). COVE provided surface verification for the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System  (CERES) satellite measurements for 16 years.  However, the large light station occupied approximately 15 % of the field of view of the upwelling longwave flux measurement (LW↑),  so radiation from the structure artificially perturbed the measurements. Hence, we use data from multiple instruments that are not influenced by the structure to accurately obtain LW↑; we call this the longwave component summation technique. The instruments required for the component summation are an infrared radiation thermometer to measure sea surface temperature, a pyrgeometer to measure downwelling longwave irradiance,  and an air temperature probe. We find a strong negative bias between the obstructed upwelling pyrgeometer measurements and the component summation LW↑ in the colder months, less so in the warmer months. The bias ranged from −6 % to +5 % over COVE from 2004–2013. These range of biases are larger than  the  Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) targeted uncertainties of 2 % or 3 W m−2 (whichever is greatest), indicating that the component summation technique provides a significant correction to standard BSRN protocols when an obstruction is present. This work documents how we determine the component summation LW↑ irradiances, demonstrates that the calculated values achieve a relative standard error of 0.6 % and are within the 2 % target uncertainty, and presents guidelines for implementing this methodology at other locations."

GLORIA-B completed its first flight from Kiruna (Sweden) in August 2021 and a second from Timmins (Canada) in August 2022 as part of the EU Research Infrastructure HEMERA (Integrated access to balloon-borne platforms for innovative research and technology). The main objectives of these flights were technical qualification and the provision of a first imaging hyperspectral limb-emission dataset from 5 to 36 km altitude. Here, we present a characterization and validation of GLORIA-B performance using vertical volume mixing ratio (VMR) profiles retrieved from the August 2021 flight. Comparisons with in-situ measurements (ozonesonde, MegaAirCore, and cryosampler) show agreement within 10 % for O3, CH4, SF6, and CFC-12, and within 10 %–20 % for CFC-11, HCFC-22, and CFC-113 up to 18 km, with larger deviations above this altitude. Another objective is analyzing diurnal changes in photochemically active species (N2O5, NO2, ClONO2, BrONO2). Observed VMR variations align well with simulations from the EMAC (ECHAM5/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry) chemistry-climate model, though absolute concentrations differ to a certain extent. Nighttime BrONO2 measurements allowed an estimate of lower stratospheric Bry (20.4 ± 2.5 pptv). These results demonstrate the suitability of balloon-borne limb-imaging spectroscopy for providing high-quality vertical trace gas profiles, offering valuable new data to improve our understanding of stratospheric composition and to support the validation of atmospheric models."

This work demonstrates how field-to-cable coupling induces currents on the LLS sensor power supply cable shield, which are responsible for spurious (scattered) magnetic fields and, thus, cause errors in the estimation of the incident angle and amplitude, called ""sensor site errors"". 
 Lightning location system (LLS) sensors, which detect and locate atmospheric discharges, are typically powered by cables buried up to one meter underground. Within the LLS community, it is well known that these cables can create spurious magnetic fields, which can in turn adversely impact the sensor measurements and the resulting data. This issue arises from currents induced in the cable shield by the lightning electromagnetic fields that penetrate the ground. The magnetic field generated by these currents lead to “site errors”, causing inaccuracies in estimating the angle of incidence and the peak current of lightning strokes. Although these sensor-specific errors can be partially corrected, a better understanding of the coupling mechanism between the lightning electromagnetic field and the cable could help in minimizing the site errors. This study presents an analysis of the lightning electromagnetic field interaction with cables and examines the influence of various ground and cable properties on this interaction. This work represents a first step toward understanding the physical mechanism leading to LLS sensor site errors. Considering simplified scenarios involving a single insulated or bare conductor, this work provides practical insights that LLS operators can use to estimate worst-case site errors for a provisioned sensor site. Additionally, we show that some site errors observed in operational sensors can be successfully reproduced with good agreement using the proposed approach."

The radar will make 3D measurements of the ionosphere at 50–1000 km altitudes. We show that the so-called multipurpose radar modulations and optimal data analysis can improve the time resolution of the measurements by more than an order of magnitude, and they enable one to measure ion-neutral collision frequencies, which are proportional to neutral particle density, in the lower ionosphere. 
 EISCAT3D will be a high-power, high-duty-cycle, large-aperture multistatic radar system with digitally steerable aperture array antennas and solid-state transmitters. The advanced technology enables the system to form multiple simultaneous beams at each radar site and to use advanced transmission modulation techniques. Multipurpose transmission modulations that use the same radar pulses for probing all altitude regions of the ionosphere, as well as the lag profile inversion technique needed for deconvolving autocorrelation functions (ACFs) of the scattering process from the received signal at selected altitudes, have previously been developed for monostatic, single-beam radars. We generalize the concept of multipurpose modulations for multistatic, multibeam systems and introduce a lag profile inversion tool that can perform the ACF deconvolution with modest computing power. We also show that lag profile inversion is not needed for the analysis of remote receiver data or D region pulse-to-pulse correlations. We deconvolve incoherent scatter ACFs from synthetic radar signals that correspond to a possible EISCAT3D multipurpose mode by means of lag profile inversion and fit plasma parameters to the deconvolved ACFs using an analysis tool that makes optimal use of data from all receive beams of the multistatic, multibeam system. The results demonstrate that the multibeam remote receivers provide significant benefits: the remote receiver data have less incoherent scatter self-noise than the core transceiver site data, they enable one to fill gaps critical for E region plasma parameter fits in monostatic ACF data, the data are accurate enough for E region ion-neutral collision frequency fits, and they enable D region measurements with arbitrary transmission modulations. We benchmark computational requirements of the lag profile inversion analysis and use both synthetic radar signal and real measurements with the KAIRA radio receiver and EISCAT VHF incoherent scatter radar to demonstrate D region measurements with a multibeam remote receiver."

The distinct behaviour in the different basins of the Spanish waters is reflected, and the need for further investment in experimental observations due to its great usefulness is also evidenced. 
 The ocean and atmosphere communicate directly through air–sea interaction fluxes. These include heat exchange by latent (LHFL) and sensible (SHFL) heat and momentum (MOFL) by wind stress. These stand as the leading predictors of how the ocean influences atmospheric variability and vice versa. In this paper, meteorological and upper-ocean measurements collected during the period of 2011–2023 aboard four research vessels over Spanish waters and adjacent seas are used to study air–sea interaction fluxes. These research vessels are Ramón Margalef (RM), Ángeles Alvariño (AJ), and Cornide de Saavedra (CS) belonging to the Instituto Español de Oceanografía (IEO-CSIC) and Miguel Oliver (MO) of the Secretaría General de Pesca of Spain. Recorded data are sent daily to the IEO Data Center on land, where quality control procedures are applied. Heat and momentum flux products are derived using the bulk aerodynamic approximation and are stored within a MEDAR/MedAtlas format alongside the meteorological and ocean variables used in the calculation.

However, observational records of TWSA are limited to 2002 onwards. To overcome this limitation, we provide a long-term TWSA data set for the global land from 1984 to 2020 by combining a data-driven approach with time‑variable gravity observations from geodetic tracking data. The data set retains seasonal consistency and adds reliable long‑term signals due to the data combination. 
 The Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on mission, GRACE-FO, have observed global mass changes and transports, expressed as terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA), for over two decades. However, for climate model evaluation, climate change attribution and other applications, multi-decadal TWSA time series are required. This need has triggered several studies on reconstructing TWSA via regression approaches or machine learning techniques, with the help of predictor variables such as rainfall, land or sea surface temperature. Here, we combine such an approach, for the first time, with large-scale time-variable gravity information from geodetic satellite laser ranging (SLR) and Doppler Orbitography by Radiopositioning Integrated on Satellite (DORIS) tracking. The new reconstruction TWSTORE (Terrestrial Water STOrage REconstruction) is formulated in a GRACE-derived empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) basis and complemented with the Löcher et al.

RTSs are key features of abrupt permafrost thaw accelerated by climate change. Using satellite images and field data, we identified and classified over 6000 RTSs. This dataset helps scientists better understand how warming is changing Arctic landscapes and provides a trusted reference for training artificial intelligence to detect these landforms in the future. 
 Permafrost thaw disrupts ecosystems, hydrology, and biogeochemical cycles, reinforcing climate change through a positive permafrost-carbon feedback loop. Thaw can be gradual, deepening the active layer, or abrupt, triggering thermokarst, thermo-erosion, or thermodenudation. Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTSs) are a key manifestation of abrupt permafrost thaw. Yet, their distribution, scale, and environmental controls in the West Siberian Arctic remain poorly understood, further complicated by their rapid evolution. This study presents an extensive update of the West Siberian RTS inventory through manual mapping using high-resolution, multi-source, multi-year recent (2016–2023) satellite basemaps (ESRI, Google Earth, and Yandex Maps). We developed an RTS classification capturing key environmental parameters, including morphology, spatial organization, terrain position, and associated relief-forming concurrent processes. The dataset comprises 6168 classified RTS landforms, integrating newly mapped sites with previously reported occurrences to provide a comprehensive view of a 445 226 km2 region covering the Yamal, Gydan, and Tazovsky peninsulas. The collected data underwent manual filtering and verification, leveraging local field experience and observations from key sites to reduce uncertainty and minimize false positives. Accuracy analysis, performed by comparing the dataset with various field datasets collected across the peninsulas, confirmed high accuracy (>90 %) for RTS identification. The dataset likely underestimated the distribution of small RTSs due to the resolution limitations of remote sensing data, hence generally providing a conservative estimate. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for diverse research fields, including ecology, biogeochemistry, geomorphology, climatology, permafrost science, and natural hazard assessment. Additionally, it provides a crucial reference dataset for machine learning applications, enhancing upcoming remote sensing classification and predictive modeling approaches.

M. Pugh,"Combining empirical and mechanistic understanding of spruce bark beetle outbreak dynamics in the LPJ-GUESS (v4.1, r13130) vegetation model","The European spruce bark beetle (SBB) has, in recent years, been the most important disturbance agent in many European forests. We implemented a SBB module in a dynamic vegetation model and calibrated it against observations from Sweden, Switzerland, Austria and France. The start and duration of outbreaks triggered by storm damage and the increased damage driven by recent warm and dry periods were reasonably well simulated, although the spread was reflected in uncertain parameter estimates. 
 For exploring forest performance in the future, dynamic vegetation models are important tools. Tree mortality is a crucial process in these models, but explicit representations of major agents of mortality have often been relatively underdeveloped. In needle-leaved forest in the temperate and boreal zones, bark beetles are often important for the mortality pattern. The European spruce bark beetle (SBB, Ips typographus) has, in recent years, replaced wind as the most important disturbance agent in European forests. Historically, SBB damage is typically triggered by wind storms as they create breeding material with no defences to overcome for the beetles. Drought can contribute to increased damage and prolonged outbreaks by lowering the defence of the trees, but it has also been the main ultimate driver of some of the European forest damage by bark beetles in the last decade. In this study we implemented an SBB damage module in a dynamic vegetation model (LPJ-GUESS) that includes representation of wind damage and forest management, with the aim to present a general concept that can be used for other bark beetle species as well. The module was calibrated against observations of storm and SBB damage in Sweden, Switzerland, Austria and France. The model was driven by SBB phenology, drought, storm felled spruce trees and a dynamic beetle population density. The model was able to catch the start and duration of outbreaks triggered by storm damage reasonably well, but with discrepancies in levels which can be at least partly related to salvage logging of storm felled forest and sanitary cutting of infested trees. The model showed increased damage in the most recent years with warm and dry conditions, although below the level reported, which may suggest that the drought response of spruce in LPJ-GUESS is underestimated. The new model forms a basis to explore vulnerability of European forests to spruce bark beetle infestations."

While computationally affordable, it is able to capture key metrics of the climate system. By comparing simulations at low, intermediate, and high horizontal resolution, we demonstrate its utility for evaluating eddy parameterizations, in terms of both their effect on the mean state and diagnosis of the unresolved eddy fluxes they aim to represent. 
 Climate models are limited in resolution by computational constraints. The ocean component is currently resolved at spatial scales between approximately 10 to 100 km, which is too coarse to adequately capture the mesoscale. Eddies at these scales play a major role in the global energy cycle, and therefore it is crucial that they are accurately parameterized. In this context, we propose DINO (DIabatic Neverworld Ocean), an ocean-only model configuration of intermediate complexity designed as a test protocol for eddy parameterizations across a range of horizontal scales. It allows for affordable simulations, even at very high resolution, while crucial aspects of the global ocean such as the meridional overturning circulation (MOC), subtropical and subpolar gyres, or the Antarctic circumpolar current (ACC) are maintained. We compare key metrics across eddy-resolving (1/16°), eddy-permitting (1/4°), and eddy parameterizing (1°) simulations to showcase the evaluation of eddy parameterizations in two ways: by testing their impact on the mean state and by directly diagnosing the missing eddy fluxes from coarse-grained high-resolution experiments."

 The current crop of models assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to produce their assessment reports lack endogenous process-based representations of climate-driven changes to human activities, especially beyond the purely economic consequences of climate change. These climate-driven changes in human activities are critical to understanding the co-evolution of the climate and human systems. Earth System Models (ESMs) that represent the climate system and Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) that represent the human system are typically separate, with assumptions that create coherency coordinated through RCPs and SSPs in ScenarioMIP, the core scenario analysis protocol. This divide limits understanding of climate-human feedback. An alternative aggregated approach, which couples human and natural systems (CHANS) such as the one used to build the Feedback-based knowledge Repository for IntegrateD Assessments “FRIDA” v2.1 IAM documented here, integrates climate and human systems into a unified global model, prioritizing feedback dynamics while maintaining interpretability. FRIDA represents the Earth's radiation balance, carbon cycle, and relevant portions of the water cycle alongside human demographics, economics, agriculture, and human energy use. Built using the System Dynamics method, it contains seven interconnected modules. Each subsystem is calibrated to data and validated to ensure structurally appropriate behaviour representation. FRIDA demonstrates that an aggregate, feedback-driven modelling approach, capturing CHANS interconnections with rigorous measurements of uncertainty, is possible. It complements conventional IAMs by highlighting missing feedback structures that affect future projections. Our work with FRIDA suggests SSP1-Baseline, SSP2-Baseline, and SSP5-Baseline are all overly optimistic on the prospects for future economic growth due to these feedbacks, while SSP3-Baseline and SSP4-Baseline, the SSPs with the highest challenges to adaptation, align more closely with our results.

The best bias correction method for each grid is selected differently depending on the weighting case. The best bias correction method can vary depending on factors such as climate and terrain. 
 This study proposed a Comprehensive Index (CI) that jointly considers bias correction performance metrics and uncertainty to guide the selection of quantile mapping methods. This approach reveals not only a performance-based ranking of bias correction methods but also how optimal method choices shift as the uncertainty weight varies. This study evaluated daily precipitation performance from 11 CMIP6 GCMs corrected by Quantile Delta Mapping (QDM), Empirical Quantile Mapping (EQM), and Detrended Quantile Mapping (DQM) using ten evaluation metrics and applied TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution) to compute performance-based rankings. Furthermore, Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) was used to quantify both individual model and ensemble prediction uncertainties. Moreover, entropy based weighting of the ten evaluation metrics reveals that error based measures such as RMSE and MAE carry the highest information content (weights 0.13–0.28 and 0.15–0.22, respectively). By aggregating TOPSIS performance scores with BMA uncertainty measures, this study developed CI. Results show that EQM achieved the best performance across most metrics 0.30 (RMSE), 0.18 (MAE), 0.98 (R2), 0.87 (KGE), 0.93 (NSE), and 0.99 (EVS) and exhibited the lowest uncertainty (variance = 0.0027) across all continents. QDM outperformed other methods in certain regions, reaching its lowest model uncertainty (variance = 0.0025) in South America. EQM was selected most frequently under all weighting scenarios, while DQM was least chosen. In South America, DQM was preferred more often than QDM when performance was emphasized, whereas the opposite occurred when uncertainty was emphasized. These findings suggest that incorporating uncertainty leads to spatially heterogeneous and parameter dependent changes in optimal bias correction method choice that would be overlooked by metric only selection."

Arsenic here primarily results from reductive dissolution of iron minerals in anoxic conditions driven by organic carbon. Here, we used digital elevation model (DEM) data to investigate how drainage density and hierarchical recharge pathways influence arsenic distribution, supported by combined data set of 136 wells (81 new, 55 from a prior study)—up to 215 m deep—along a 170 km west‐to‐east transect across the delta. Findings indicate arsenic hotspots in the mid‐central region of the delta, where high drainage density appears to facilitate focused recharge, delivering organic carbon to underlying aquifers. Compared with other deltaic regions across Asia, the Ayeyarwady has fewer high‐arsenic wells, with only 21% of our data set exceeding the local 50 μg/l limit. National screening data from 123,962 wells indicate that while only 8% exceed the regulatory limit of 50 μg/l set by Myanmar, 71% exceed the 10 μg/l guideline recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). This highlights widespread exposure risk not addressed under the current national standard, particularly for rural communities. The observed variability in arsenic concentrations, driven by complex redox dynamics and groundwater flow patterns, indicates that contamination can occur even within short spatial intervals. A blanket‐screening program focused on hotspot regions is essential to ensure that at‐risk populations are not unknowingly exposed to unsafe drinking water."

 The most abundant type of planet discovered in the Galaxy has no analogue in our Solar System and is believed to consist of a rocky interior with an overlying thick H2 dominated envelope. Models have predicted that the reaction between the atmospheric hydrogen and the underlying magma ocean can lead to the production of significant amounts of water. The models suffer however from the current lack of experimental data on the reaction between hydrogen and silicate melt at high pressures and temperatures. Here we present novel experimental results designed to investigate this interaction. Laser heating diamond anvil cell experiments were conducted between 16 and 60 GPa at temperatures above 4000 K. We find that copious amounts of hydrogen dissolve into the silicate melt with a large dependence on temperature rather than pressure. We also find that the reduction of iron oxide leads to the production of significant amounts of water along with the formation of iron-enriched blebs. Altogether, the results predict that the typical processes attending planet formation will result in significant water production with repercussions for the chemistry and structure of the planetary interior as well as the atmosphere."

 Tyrannosaurus rex ranks among the most comprehensively studied extinct vertebrates1 and a model system for dinosaur paleobiology1. As one of the last surviving non-avian dinosaurs, Tyrannosaurus is a crucial datum for assessing terrestrial biodiversity, ecosystem structure, and biogeographic exchange immediately preceding the end-Cretaceous mass extinction —one of Earth’s greatest biological catastrophes. Paleobiological studies of Tyrannosaurus, including ontogenetic niche partitioning2-4, feeding, locomotor biomechanics,5,6and life history7-9 have drawn upon an expanding skeletal sample comprising multiple hypothesized growth stages—and yet the Tyrannosaurus hypodigm remains controversial10-13. A key outstanding question relates to specimens considered to exemplify immature Tyrannosaurus1,14-19, which have been argued to represent the distinct taxon Nanotyrannus11,13,20,21. Here, we describe an exceptionally well-preserved, near somatically mature tyrannosaur skeleton (NCSM 40000) from the Hell Creek Formation that shares autapomorphies with the holotype specimen of N. lancensis. We couple comparative anatomy, longitudinal growth models, observations on ontogenetic character invariance, and a novel phylogenetic dataset to test the validity of Nanotyrannus, demonstrating conclusively that this taxon is distinguishable from Tyrannosaurus, sits outside Tyrannosauridae, and unexpectedly contains two species—N. lancensis and N. lethaeus, sp. nov. Our results prompt a re-evaluation of dozens of existing hypotheses based on currently indefensible ontogenetic trajectories. Finally, we document at least two co-occurring, ecomorphologically distinct genera in the Maastrichtian of North America, demonstrating that tyrannosauroid alpha diversity was thriving within one million years of the end-Cretaceous extinction."

 As per de Gennes’ predictions, a superconducting layer placed between two ferromagnetic insulators can drive an antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between them. Using two ferromagnetic insulating GdN layers having dissimilar switching fields sandwiching a superconducting Vanadium thin film, we demonstrate evidence of such exchange coupling. We demonstrate that such an exchange coupling promotes switching between zero and finite resistance states of Vanadium. Our devices hold either a finite resistance or a zero-resistance state at zero magnetic field, dependent on their magnetic field history. Moreover, we demonstrate the absolute switching effect, thus making such devices suitable for application at the lowest temperatures as non-volatile cryogenic memory useful for futuristic quantum circuits and for several other superconducting spintronic applications.

 Quasi-two-dimensional perovskite structures hold great potential as active layers in blue perovskite light-emitting diodes. However, they face challenges of limited emission efficiency and broadened spectra due to phase inhomogeneity. Here, we report an intermediate-direct-pinning method to develop a uniform-phase quasi-two-dimensional structure with a homogeneous energy landscape. By forming a strong cation-π interaction complex, we stabilize a metastable intermediate phase with retarded crystallization toward low-n phases (n ≤ 3), followed by a direct pinning process favouring crystallization of medium-n phases (n = 4 and 5) without further broadening. Additionally, introducing a surface-anchoring ligand during the pinning process effectively suppresses non-radiative recombination. The resultant structure shows efficient sky-blue emission and narrow linewidth (108 meV). Devices fabricated with this structure reach a maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.5% at 489 nm, which is scalable to large-area (pixel size: 900 mm2) and passive matrix devices (30 × 10 arrays, active area = 200 μm × 600 μm).

Here, O-bridged Cu catalytic pairs boost acetylene hydrochlorination by tailored orbital coupling, shifting reaction pathways and lowering energy barriers. 
 Achieving specific orbital activation of C ≡ C by controlling the precise atomic architecture of supported metals is crucial for the selective transformation of alkynes. However, its physical mechanism remains a subject of debate. Herein, we construct a well-defined O-bridged CuN3-O-CuN3 integrative catalytic pairs (Cu ICPs) based on Kirkendall effect. As a result, Cu ICPs with mixed Cu2+-Cu3+ species demonstrate >99% conversion and >550 h stability in acetylene hydrochlorination (simulated industrial reaction conditions), showcasing unparalleled performance in the liquid-phase hydrochlorination of five alkynes as well. A combined experimental and theoretical analyses reveal selective coupling between the dxz/dyz orbitals of Cu ICPs and the σ orbitals of C ≡ C in C2H2, leading to the formation of highly reactive di-σ-HC = CH intermediate. Additionally, the presence of the bridged-O species promotes HCl dissociation, altering the addition pathway from the classical Eley-Rideal (E-R) mechanism to a Cl•-trigged Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) mechanism, ultimately reducing the intrinsic energy barrier for addition, and breaking the universal standard electrode potential linear scaling relations.

 Gene discoveries in obesity have largely relied on homogeneous populations, limiting their generalizability across ancestries. Here, we conduct a gene-based rare variant association study of BMI on 839,110 individuals from six ancestries across two population-scale biobanks. A cross-ancestry meta-analysis identifies 13 genes, including YLPM1, RIF1, GIGYF1, SLC5A3, and GRM7, that confer about three-fold risk for severe obesity, are expressed in the brain and adipose tissue, and are linked to obesity traits such as body-fat percentage. While YLPM1, MC4R, and SLTM show consistent effects, GRM7 and APBA1 show significant ancestral heterogeneity. Polygenic risk additively increases obesity penetrance, and phenome-wide studies reveal additional associations, including YLPM1 with altered mental status. These genes also influence cardiometabolic comorbidities, including GIGYF1 and SLTM towards type 2 diabetes with or without BMI as a mediator, and altered levels of plasma proteins, such as LECT2 and NCAN, which in turn affect BMI.

 In recent years, there has been a growing interest in utilizing machine learning (ML) to investigate the predictability of shear-slip failures, known as laboratory quakes, in centimeter-scale rock-friction experiments. However, the applicability of ML to larger-scale laboratory quakes and natural earthquakes, where important timescales vary by orders of magnitude, remains uncertain. Here, we apply an advanced ML approach to meter-scale laboratory quake data, characterized by accelerating foreshock activity manifesting as increasing numbers of tiny acoustic emission events. We demonstrate that a trained ML model, using a network representation of the event catalog, can accurately predict the time-to-failure of meter-scale mainshocks, from tens of seconds to milliseconds before the upcoming main quakes. These timescales correspond to approximately decades down to weeks in the context of large earthquakes. By comparing our results with a dynamic model of shear failures that replicates the experimental data, we suggest that tracking the evolution of shear stress on creeping fault areas, rather than nominal shear stress, indirectly through the acoustic emission events, enables ML to predict both numerical and laboratory quakes. These findings provide critical insights into fault conditions that may facilitate short-term forecasting of earthquakes in nature. In this study, machine learning accurately predicts meter-scale laboratory quakes from tiny foreshocks, bridging the scale gap between laboratory and natural earthquakes and offering insights into short-term earthquake forecasting."

The embodied water in materials has surged in material production with the potential to exacerbate regional water scarcity. 
 Producing essential, widely used materials such as steel, cement, paper, plastics and rubber requires substantial freshwater resources, which may exacerbate water scarcity. Despite this, comprehensive research on freshwater embodied in material production remains limited. Here we assess the blue water footprint (WFblue) of 16 metallic and non-metallic material categories across 164 regions, using a multiregional input–output model and the hypothetical extraction method. Our findings indicate that the global WFblue of material production doubled from 25.1 billion m3 in 1995 to 50.7 billion m3 in 2021, raising its share in global blue water consumption from 2.8% to 4.7%. The East, South Asia and Oceania regions saw an alarming 267% surge in WFblue for material production, with China—already facing medium-high water stress—experiencing a dramatic ~400% increase. As material production is expected to grow, we underscore the urgency of a water–materials nexus approach, particularly in water-stressed countries.

 Natural hydrocarbon seepages constitute a substantial influx of oil and gas into hydrosphere and atmosphere, impacting the environment and greenhouse gas budgets. The Lusi seepage system (Indonesia) is one of the Earth’s largest surface hydrocarbon manifestations, and is intrinsically associated with the interaction of organic-rich sedimentary rocks and recent magmatism. Previous ground-based and satellite measurements revealed that Lusi is a mega emitter of thermogenic methane, releasing ~0.1 Mt methane per year. Here, linking the quantification of mud flow rates with oil concentration data, we estimate that Lusi released ~0.22-0.28 Mt of oil over 13 years of continuous fluid discharge. This emission is of the same order of magnitude as the Deepwater Horizon spill. The oil discharge into the Porong River and Madura Strait poses an environmental threat to aquatic ecosystems of north-east Java. Combining flux and concentration data, we have also estimated a release into the atmosphere of ~8-10 kt of ethane and ~6-8 kt of propane per year. Over 18 years, Lusi has already injected into the atmosphere more than 20 times the amount of ethane released by the 2015 Aliso Canyon gas storage accident (California), considered as one of the largest gas leaks in U.S. history.

 Earthquake stress drop (Δσ) may increase with depth and stress in the brittle lithosphere. However, the range of uncertainty in Δσ and the lack of constraints on absolute stress make it difficult to establish whether they are correlated. Here, we investigate Δσ dependence on depth and maximum shear stress (τmax) based on ~11 years of seismicity in the northeastern Japanese forearc following the 2011 Tohoku-Oki megathrust earthquake. We interpret Δσ estimates computed using both individual spectra and spectral-ratio methods and find that Δσ exhibits a clear depth dependence within the seismically active upper ~60 km of the forearc lithosphere ( ~ 0.8 MPa per 10 km). We further compare Δσ values with quantitative τmax estimates from finite-element models of force balance. We find that median Δσ values increase with τmax in the brittle forearc lithosphere and that earthquake stress release is proportional to τmax. The dependence of Δσ on τmax explains the apparent depth dependence of Δσ and suggests that average Δσ values provide a relative measure of the stress at failure. In the northeastern Japanese forearc, Δσ values remained roughly constant in the decade following the Tohoku-Oki earthquake, suggesting negligible changes in failure stress in the forearc since the mainshock.

 An important yet understudied factor in climate adaptation is information: are people informed about future climate-related risks, and does adaptation depend on this knowledge? Focusing on whether communication about projected sea level rise affects the stated likelihood of migration, here we developed a randomized information experiment implemented in a face-to-face survey of >7,000 respondents across Vietnam. We find that providing a text-based information treatment regarding Vietnam’s exposure to projected sea level rise increases respondents’ stated likelihood of migration, including respondents at low-risk. A map information treatment leads to a more targeted effect, only increasing the likelihood of migration among respondents in high-risk areas. Finally, adding doubt to the treatments, by mentioning an official repudiation of the information, does not reduce the treatments’ impact.

 Rapid land use change, invasive species, and climate change are key drivers of the biodiversity crisis, creating an urgent need for high-quality satellite indices designed for biodiversity applications. The Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs) are strongly correlated with species richness at global to landscape scales, and NASA has selected the DHIs as a future Earth data product. However, existing DHIs are outdated, rely on MODIS collection 5, and lack quality flags and uncertainty estimates. To address these limitations, we had four key objectives: (1) generate global DHIs based on all 500-m MODIS Collection 6.1 Terra/Aqua and VIIRS Version 2 vegetation products (NDVI, EVI, LAI, fPAR, and GPP), (2) create quality assessment layers and uncertainty metrics, (3) assess consistency between MODIS and VIIRS DHIs, (4) evaluate DHIs’ performance in predicting global species richness. Multi-year composite DHIs were calculated for 2013–2022 to ensure temporal consistency. Results showed that DHIs were effective proxies representing three aspects of vegetation productivity closely related to species richness. MODIS and VIIRS DHIs were highly correlated (cumulative: 0.98–0.99, minimum: 0.74–0.99, variation: 0.92–0.99). Quality and uncertainty assessments showed high reliability overall, though with some regional variations due to sensor differences in reflectance bands, cloud/snow masks, and seasonal patterns. The new DHIs predicted species richness well (RMSEs up to 9.12 % for amphibians, 11.36 % for birds, 12.21 % for mammals, 13.40 % for reptiles; R2 up to 0.59, 0.63, 0.63, 0.72, respectively). VIIRS DHIs generally outperformed MODIS, except for MODIS Terra GPP DHIs, which best predicted richness. These updated DHIs are mature, consistent products and suitable for broad biodiversity monitoring."

 Fusing LRHSI with HRMSI is a widely used strategy to generate HRHSI. Diffusion models, which progressively denoise input data, effectively capture both global structures and fine details, offering flexible modeling of complex spectral-spatial relationships. These models have shown strong generative capabilities for hyperspectral-multispectral image (HSI-MSI) fusion, with promising application potential. However, two main challenges persist: (1) insufficient guidance from physical priors during residual generation, leading to spectral and structural distortions; and (2) the simplistic injection of HRMSI as an auxiliary condition into the denoising network results in weak interaction between high- and low-frequency spatial features of HRMSI and LRHSI. In response to these challenges, our proposed Prior-Guided Fusion Diffusion Network (PG-FDN) enables HSI-MSI fusion. PG-FDN integrates a Prior-Guided Gradient Mechanism (PGGM) and a denoising model. PGGM embeds spectral-frequency priors into the gradient update process, guiding residual generation to reduce spectral distortion and preserve local textures. Additionally, the denoising model adopts a Bidirectional Progressive Decoder (BPD), which enables hierarchical integration of HRMSI spatial features via forward–backward feature interaction. Using two synthetic and three real-world datasets, experiments reveal that PG-FDN outperforms six representative methods. Component-wise ablation analyses validate the individual contribution of each module, and cross-domain evaluations further confirm its robustness and adaptability.

 The Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH) proposes that spectral heterogeneity (SH), derived from optical data, can serve as a proxy for estimating biodiversity. In this study, we tested the SVH across 42 forest plots in the Italian Alps using imaging spectroscopy data from the EnMAP satellite. We investigated the relationship between SH—quantified using two different metrics, Rao’s Q and the coefficient of variation (CV)—and tree species diversity (using Shannon’s H index and species richness). We applied three levels of spectral analysis: (1) SH calculated for each individual EnMAP band; (2) SH aggregated across broader spectral ranges (Visible -VIS-, Near Infrared -NIR-, and Shortwave Infrared -SWIR-) and (3) SH derived from vegetation indices (VIs). These analyses were performed under three spatial approaches: (A) a normal approach assigning equal weight to all four EnMAP pixels intersecting a plot; (B) a weighted approach based on the proportional overlap of each pixel with the plot area; and (C) a weighted canopy cover (CC)>70% approach, which included only plots with CC greater than 70% as derived from airborne laser scanning (ALS) LiDAR data.Weak to moderate correlations were observed when SH was derived from single bands, with the strongest relationships in the NIR (R2 approaching 0.4), followed by the VIS and SWIR regions. A similar trend emerged when SH was aggregated across broader spectral ranges, with the highest correlations again found in the NIR (R2 up to 0.35). In contrast, lower R2 values were obtained when SH was computed from specific VIs.The weighted approaches, especially when restricted to plots with CC >70%, consistently yielded higher R2 values than the equal-weight approach in all three the spectral analysis. Results were consistent across both SH metrics (Rao’s Q and CV), with stronger correlations when species richness was used as the biodiversity metric. This work highlights how EnMAP hyperspectral data, despite inherent constraints, can provide valuable insights into forest biodiversity monitoring."

 Long-term exposure to ultrafine particles (PM0.1/UFPs) is proposed to be related with many diseases. Large-scale epidemic studies related with UFPs are scarce due to the lack of UFP spatial distributions. While existing research predominantly stressed the dominant influences of vehicular sources, the impact of cooking emissions might be significant in Chinese megacities, due to high-emitting cooking styles. This study performed high-density spatial measurements (0.40 km2/site) of UFPs using 3 electric motorcycles carrying 3 condensation particle counters (CPCs) at 153 sites in Wuchang District in the megacity Wuhan, central China. We analyzed particle number (PN) distributions across different types of sites, quantified distance-decay relationships between UFPs and cooking sources, and developed high-resolution (25 m × 25 m grid) land-use regression (LUR) models linking PN concentrations with geographic predictors. Key findings include: (1) Restaurant-adjacent sites exhibited the highest PN levels (significantly exceeding traffic-adjacent sites), one of the key reasons is that the density of restaurants is highly related with dense buildings which hinders dispersion; (2) PN concentrations decay exponentially with the distance from the nearest restaurant; (3) Traffic-adjacent sites have lower-than-average PN concentrations, benefiting from favorable ventilation conditions of the wide roads; (4) The most important buffer size for restaurant variables, traffic variables, and diffusion variables are ≤50 m, 100–200 m, and 500 m, respectively, reflecting the higher spatial heterogeneity caused by cooking emissions in typical Chinese megacities. Thus, to catch the hot spots caused by restaurants, the resolution of the LUR model needs to be ≤ 50 m. These findings provide novel insights into urban UFP source apportionment and emphasize the necessity of incorporating cooking emission dynamics in environmental exposure assessments for rapidly urbanizing regions."
