10.1088/1748-9326/ad7476,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究了自1979年以来北极-中纬度联系的阶段性演变特征。研究发现，巴伦支-喀拉海（BKS）对流层厚度与东亚气温之间存在阶段性变化，表现为弱（P1：1979-2000）-强（P2：2001-2011）-弱（P3：2012-2021）的连接。研究还发现，BKS变暖与东亚冬季风之间的联系变化可能导致这种阶段性演变，而北极涛动在调节其阶段性演变中起着重要作用。这项研究有助于我们深入了解北极变暖与中纬度气候变化之间关系强弱的演变。,"['Arctic sea ice', 'tropospheric thickness', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric temperature', 'climate variations', 'East Asian winter Monsoon', 'Arctic Oscillation']",Yuxin Wang;Bingyi Wu,Dominant features of phasic evolutions in the winter Arctic-midlatitude linkage since 1979,"Over the past decades, the Arctic-midlatitude linkage has been extensively explored. Recent studies have suggested that the characteristics of phasic evolutions in the relationship between the Arctic warming and midlatitudes remain elusive. Therefore, this study systematically investigates this issue by using running empirical orthogonal function and moving correlation, and the results show a phasic alternation process in the relationship between the tropospheric thickness over the Barents–Kara Seas (BKS) and East Asian temperature, characterized by a phasic weak (P1: 1979–2000)–strong (P2: 2001–2011)–weak (P3: 2012–2021) connection. Our results highlight that since the winter of 2010, despite the Arctic sea ice being in an exceptionally reduced phase and continuous Arctic warming, the Arctic-midlatitude connection has not exhibited sustained strengthening relative to P2 phase. Moreover, it is found that changes of the connection between the BKS warming and the East Asian winter Monsoon may contribute to this phasic evolution, and the Arctic Oscillation plays an important role in modulating their phasic evolutions. The conclusions of this study help to deepen our understanding of the evolution of the strength and weakness of the relationship between Arctic warming and climate variations in midlatitudes."
10.5194/amt-17-5201-2024,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,该研究利用多种仪器分析了南美洲赤道和亚热带地区臭氧的垂直分布和总量。研究方法包括使用臭氧探空仪（SHADOZ/NASA）和卫星数据（TIMED/SABER），以及地面和卫星仪器的分析，从而能够更深入地研究这两个纬度地区的臭氧。研究的主要目的是了解臭氧含量观测的纬度差异如何影响这种微量气体的行为。,"['ozone', 'vertical profiles', 'total columns', 'ozonesondes', 'satellite data', 'TIMED/SABER', 'ground-based instruments', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis']",Gabriela Dornelles Bittencourt;Hassan Bencherif;Damaris Kirsch Pinheiro;Nelson Begue;Lucas Vaz Peres;José Valentin Bageston;Douglas Lima de Bem;Francisco Raimundo da Silva;Tristan Millet,Multi-instrumental analysis of ozone vertical profiles and total columns in South America: comparison between subtropical and equatorial latitudes,"The study examines the behavior of ozone at equatorial and subtropical latitudes in South America, in a multi-instrumental analysis. The methodology applied used ozonesondes (SHADOZ/NASA) and satellite data (TIMED/SABER), as well as analysis with ground-based and satellite instruments, allowing a more in-depth study at both latitudes. The main motivation is to understand how latitudinal differences in the observation of ozone content can interfere with the behavior of this trace gas. 
 The behavior of ozone gas (O3) in the atmosphere varies according to the region of the globe. Its formation occurs mainly in the tropical stratosphere through the photodissociation of molecular oxygen with the aid of the incidence of ultraviolet solar radiation. Still, the highest concentrations of O3 content are found in high-latitude regions (poles) due to the Brewer–Dobson circulation, a large-scale circulation that takes place from the tropics to the pole in the winter hemisphere. This work presents a multi-instrumental analysis at two Brazilian sites, a subtropical one (Santa Maria – 29.72° S, 53.41° W) and an equatorial one (Natal – 5.4° S, 35.4° W), to investigate ozone distributions in terms of vertical profiles (2002–2020) and total abundance in terms of total columns of ozone (1979–2020). The study is based on the use of ground-based and satellite observations. Ozone profiles over Natal, from the ground up to the mesosphere, are obtained by radiosonde experiments (0–30 km) in the framework of the SHADOZ program and by satellite measurements from the SABER instrument (15–60 km). This enabled the construction of a continuous time series for ozone, including monthly values and climatological trends. There is a good agreement between the two measurements in the common observation layer, mainly for altitudes above 20 km. Below 20 km, SABER ozone profiles showed high variability and overestimated ozone mixing ratios by over 50 %. Dynamic and photochemical effects can interfere with O3 formation and distribution along higher latitudes through the Brewer–Dobson circulation. The measurements of the total ozone columns used are in good agreement with each other (TOMS/OMI × Dobson for Natal and TOMS/OMI × Brewer for Santa Maria) in time and space, in line with previous studies for these latitudes. Wavelet analysis was used over 42 years. The investigation revealed a significant annual cycle in both data series for both sites. The study highlighted that the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) plays a significant role in the variability of stratospheric ozone at the two study sites – Natal and Santa Maria. The QBO's contribution was found to be stronger at the Equator (Natal) than at the subtropics (Santa Maria). Additionally, the study showed that the 11-year solar cycle also has a significant impact on ozone variability at both locations. Given the study latitudes, the ozone variations observed at the two sites showed different patterns and amounts. Only a limited number of studies have been conducted on stratospheric ozone in South America, particularly in the region between the Equator and the subtropics. The primary aim of this work is to investigate the behavior of stratospheric ozone at various altitudes and latitudes using ground-based and satellite measurements in terms of vertical profiles and total columns of ozone."

A main application of LCA is to compare alternative products to identify and promote those that are more environmentally friendly. Such comparative LCA studies often rest on, explicitly or implicitly, an idealized assumption, namely, 1:1 displacement between functionally equivalent products. However, product displacement in the real world is much more complicated, affected by various factors such as the rebound effect and policy schemes. Here, we quantitatively review studies that have considered these aspects to evaluate the magnitude and distribution of realistic displacement estimates across several major product categories (biofuels, electricity, electric vehicles, and recycled products). Results show that displacement ratios concentrate around 40–60%,  suggesting considerable overestimation of the benefits of alternative products if the 1:1 displacement assumption was used. Overall, there have been a small number of modeling studies on realistic product displacement and their scopes were limited. Additional research is needed to cover more product categories and geographies and improve  the modeling of market and policy complexities. As such research accumulates, their displacement estimates can form a database that can be drawn upon by comparative LCA studies to more accurately determine the environmental impacts of alternative products."
10.1029/2024GL109777,True,Geophysical Research Letters,这篇研究论文探讨了冰雪覆盖区域的暖湿极端事件的盛行情况。研究发现，与非冰雪覆盖区域常见的暖干极端事件相比，冰雪覆盖区域更易出现暖湿极端事件。论文利用ERA5再分析数据分析了冰雪覆盖区域和非冰雪覆盖区域的暖干极端事件和暖湿极端事件的持续时间和频率。研究还揭示了两种极端事件的物理机制，并将其归因于冰雪覆盖导致的陆地-大气相互作用减弱，从而抑制了土壤水分反馈，降低了冰雪覆盖区域暖事件的强度和持续时间。,"['temperature extremes', 'precipitation extremes', 'climate change', 'reanalysis data', 'ERA5', 'atmospheric circulation', 'high-pressure systems']",Xinlu Chen;Lianlian Xu;Ran Yang;Ming Cai;Yi Deng;Deliang Chen;Song Yang;Jiping Liu;Qinghua Yang;Xiaoming Hu,Deciphering the Prevalence of Warm‐Wet Extremes in Ice‐Covered Zones,"Compound warm extremes exert profound impacts on environment, health, and socioeconomics. Yang et al. (2024) indicated a shift or transition from warm‐dry extremes (WDEs), common in non‐ice‐covered areas, to warm‐wet extremes (WWEs) in ice‐covered zones. Utilizing ERA5 reanalysis data, this study determined the duration and frequency of WDEs and WWEs across ice‐covered and non‐ice‐covered regions. A comprehensive analysis uncovers the physical mechanisms responsible for the paradigm differences and attributes them to the weakening of land‐atmosphere interaction caused by ice‐cover, which inhibits soil moisture feedback and reduces the intensity and duration of warm events in ice‐covered areas. Both WDEs and WWEs are associated with high‐pressure systems (HPs). WDEs, situated directly beneath HPs, intensify due to adiabatic warming from subsidence motions. Conversely, WWEs, located beneath the poleward fringes of HPs, emerge from advective warming and moistening associated with poleward intrusions of warm‐moist air."

Nonetheless, disentangling the specific impacts of dust from the overlying meteorology influence on high clouds presents great challenges. In this study, we construct a meteorological pattern that successfully reveal the intricate connection between high cloud distribution and atmospheric conditions. Through this strong bounded relationship, we find that dust exhibits notable controls over the facilitation or inhibition of ice particle growth contingent upon the prevailing meteorological fields. More dust can increase precipitation rate and shorten high cloud lifetime particularly under favorable meteorology. These findings underscore the crucial role of dust concentration in mitigating global warming for future climate change."

A horizontal viscosity scheme restricted to only act on horizontally rotational modes (such as eddies) is introduced and tested. At lower resolutions with horizontal grid spacings of 2 km, the modeled IW dissipation from numerical model agrees reasonably well with observations in some cases when the restricted form of horizontal viscosity is used. This suggests the possibility that if restricted forms of horizontal viscosity are adopted by global models with similar resolutions, they could be used to diagnose and map IW dissipation distributions. At higher resolutions with horizontal grid spacings of ∼250 m, the dissipation from vertical shear and horizontal viscosity act much more strongly resulting in dissipation overestimates; however, the vertical‐shear dissipation itself is found to agree well with observations."

Here we explore the three‐dimensional (spatial and temporal) characteristics and movements of LSExPs and their direct drivers (vertical velocity, water vapor and moisture advection) under six synoptic‐scale circulation patterns in southeastern China. LSExPs are classified as low‐pressure or non‐low types based on circulation anomaly patterns. The low‐pressure LSExPs are associated with anomalous cyclonic low‐pressure systems in the mid‐ and lower‐troposphere, occurring with main coastal precipitation, while the non‐low LSExPs mainly result from cold‐warm air convergence and primarily affect inland areas. Low‐pressure LSExPs exhibit relatively high intensity compared to non‐low types, particularly on days featuring a south‐low and north‐high dipole pattern, which tend to produce more localized and intense precipitation events. Non‐low LSExPs show larger precipitation areas, longer durations, and greater movement distances, and thus impact wider regions, compared to low‐pressure LSExPs. Single high‐pressure or low‐pressure systems are less likely to result in LSExPs, and LSExPs are less severe if occur, compared to other types. All LSExP types move in a direction similar to that of moisture transport, strongly influenced by extreme upward motion of moisture. Low‐pressure LSExPs are more related to the upward motion of the atmosphere at 850 hPa, and they also involve extreme water vapor and moisture transport."

Wright;Zengyuan Guo;Wenyu Huang;Yiran Peng,Effects of Anthropogenic Aerosols on the East Asian Winter Monsoon,"Circulation patterns linked to the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) affect precipitation, surface temperature, and air quality extremes over East Asia. These circulation patterns can in turn be influenced by aerosol radiative and microphysical effects through diabatic heating and its impacts on atmospheric vorticity. Using global model simulations, we investigate the effects of anthropogenic aerosol emissions and concentration changes on the intensity and variability of the EAWM. Comparison with reanalysis products indicates that the model captures the mean state of the EAWM well. The experiments indicate that anthropogenic aerosol emissions strengthen the Siberian High but weaken the East Asian jet stream, making the land areas of East Asia colder, drier, and snowier. Aerosols reduce mean surface air temperatures by approximately 1.5° $1.5{}^{\circ}$C, comparable to about half of the difference between strong and weak EAWM episodes in the control simulation. The mechanisms behind these changes are evaluated by analyzing differences in the potential vorticity budget. Anthropogenic aerosol effects on diabatic heating strengthen anomalous subsidence over southern East Asia, establishing an anticyclonic circulation anomaly that suppresses deep convection and precipitation. Aerosol effects on cloud cover and cloud longwave radiative heating weaken stability over the eastern flank of the Tibetan Plateau, intensifying upslope flow along the western side of the anticyclone. Both circulation anomalies contribute to reducing surface air temperatures through regional impacts on thermal advection and the atmospheric radiative balance."

However, the impact of ocean feedbacks on this interaction has not been fully examined. To study it, positive STPs were applied in three otherwise identical, idealized model configurations –atmosphere‐only (A), atmosphere + slab‐ocean (AS), and fully‐coupled atmosphere‐ocean (AO)–and the resulting atmospheric changes compared. In the AO model, changes in the tropics (extratropics) experienced a poleward‐expansion (shift) and positive (negative) feedback after ∼100–200 years, whilst the AS model showed atmospheric and sea surface temperature changes that did not resemble those seen in the AO model. In the AO model, changes in tropical ocean heat content were responsible for the atmospheric changes, attributable to changes in the Ekman transport. These results indicate that full atmosphere‐ocean coupling should be accounted for when studying the long‐term (100+ years) tropospheric response to STPs in the Southern Hemisphere. Validation with higher‐resolution and more realistic models is necessary."

Heat‐sensitive INPs and lysozyme‐sensitive INPs were considered as biological INPs and bacterial INPs, respectively. Microorganisms and OM molecules in precipitation were identified by high‐throughput sequencing technology and ultrahigh‐resolution mass spectrometry, respectively. Results revealed a predominant biological (heat‐sensitive) composition (78.8% and 93.2%) of total and nanoscale INPs at temperatures above −15°C. Specifically, bacterial (lysozyme‐sensitive) INPs accounted for 36.1% of the biological INPs at temperatures above −15°C. A notable correlation between sulfur‐containing organic compounds, mainly proteinaceous and lignin‐like substances, and INPs was uncovered, with a co‐occurrence network linking these compounds to Gram‐positive bacteria and Agaricomycetes.

Over two months, the total measured VOCs averaged 32 ± 24 ppb (mean ± standard deviation) with the hourly maximum at 141 ppb, and the total calculated OH reactivity averaged 3.7 ± 3.0 s−1 (maximum at 20.7 s−1). Among them, methanol and ethanol were the most abundant VOCs, making up 42% of the ambient mixing ratio. Isoprene and monoterpenes contributed 25% of the OH reactivity from VOCs, while formaldehyde and acetaldehyde made up another 30%. The positive matrix factorization analysis showed 5 major sources of VOCs, with 32% of abundance being attributed to secondary production/biogenic sources, 44% from the combination of traffic and personal care products, 15% from industrial solvent use, and the rest from biomass burning (10%). Moderate smoke‐impacted days elevated various hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) on average by 45%–217% compared to smoke‐free days. The ratio of OH reactivity from NOx to that from VOCs showed that ozone production was mostly VOC‐limited throughout the campaign, consistent with our modeling study. VOCs and NOx both showed increased OH reactivity due to smoke influence. NOx featured increased reactivity on weekdays compared to weekends, an effect not shown for VOC reactivity during SAMOZA."

An average 1.5 TC (of any intensity) per year was observed over the Western Arabian Sea, with two asymmetrical seasons, namely May–June (30% of cyclonic days) and September–December (70%). Case studies reveal that in many instances, TC‐related rainfall extends beyond 500 km from the TC center, and that substantial rains occur one to 2 days after the lifecycle of the TC. Despite their rarity, in the otherwise arid to semi‐arid context characteristic of the region, TCs contribute in both seasons to a very high percentage of total rainfall (up to 30%–60%) over the northwestern Arabian Sea, the Gulf of Aden and their coastlines. Over inland northern Somalia, contributions are much lower. TCs disproportionately contribute to some of the most intense daily falls, which are often higher than the mean annual rainfall. A strong increase in the number of TCs is found from 1990 to 2020, hence their enhanced contribution to local rainfall. This increase is associated with a warmer eastern/southern Arabian Sea, a decrease in vertical wind shear, and a strong increase in tropospheric moisture content."

Diurnal profiles of propanal and methyl vinyl ketone followed isoprene and O3, suggesting a common biogenic origin and fast photochemical production. In October, dominating northerly descending dry air mass led to a 10‐fold increase in acetone and methyl ethyl ketone, suggesting a large free tropospheric reservoir and abundant precursors of these ketones. Enhanced source apportionment aided by a comprehensive emission speciation data set identified five classes of VOCs from a much larger pool of local and regional emission sources than reported from previous studies. Seasonal transition of VOCs offers unique natural constraint for the chemistry and sources of VOCs in this and other similar regions, which warrants future long term measurements and advanced modeling and analysis."

Gabrielle was an ex‐tropical cyclone that stalled and re‐energised off the north coast, resembling descriptions of worst case scenarios for the northeast of the country. Here we report on a comparison of the actual forecast of the storm against forecasts under conditions representative of a climate without anthropogenic interference and of a climate +2.0°C warmer than pre‐industrial (about 1.0°C cooler and warmer than present respectively). We find that regional total rainfall accumulations from a Gabrielle‐like storm are about 10% higher because of the historical anthropogenic warming, and will increase by a larger amount under similar future warming. These differences are driven by a 20% (relative to a non‐anthropogenic world) to 30% (relative to a +2.0°C world) rise in peak rainfall rates, which in turn is mainly driven by a more temporally concentrated column‐integrated moisture flux. The forecast model generates the larger increase for the +2.0°C world through greater precipitation efficiency, reflecting the importance of unresolved precipitation processes in the climate change response of rainfall extremes."

Luong,Variations in Rainfall Structure of Western North Pacific Landfalling Tropical Cyclones in the Warming Climates,"Observations and climate projections suggest a larger increase in tropical cyclone (TC)‐induced rainfall than that can be explained by the Clausius‐Clapeyron relationship of 7% increase in vapor content for each 1°C degree rise in temperature. However, these studies using diverse data sources and methods over various periods show inconsistencies regarding the location of this increase ‐ whether in the TC inner core or outer regions ‐ and offer differing explanations for the reported trends. This study uses the Pseudo‐global warming methodology on simulations of 117 western North Pacific TCs making landfall in Southeast Asia to investigate changes in TC rainfall structure by the end of the century under the SSP2‐4.5 and SSP3‐7.0 scenarios. Specifically, it tests the sensitivity of changing trends to various analysis methods used in previous studies and identifies the underlying physical mechanisms driving these changes. The findings indicate an amplified increase in rainfall in the TC inner core across all future scenarios, along with potentially decreased rainfall in the outer region under certain future climate conditions. Among TC categories, Supertyphoons exhibit the most significant increased rainfall across future states. Changes in TC primary and secondary circulations, TC structure, and the convergence of heat and moisture are the main factors shaping future rainfall patterns, outweighing the effects of changes in atmospheric and convective stability."

As opposed to previous results, we find that the spatial and seasonal patterns of precipitation change are remarkably consistent across models. We focus on the South American Monsoon (SAM), the West African Monsoon (WAM), the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) and the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM). Models consistently suggest substantial disruptions for WAM, ISM, and EASM with shorter wet and longer dry seasons (−29.07%, −18.76%, and −3.78% ensemble mean annual rainfall change, respectively). Models also agree on changes for the SAM, suggesting rainfall increases overall, in contrast to previous studies. These are more pronounced in the southern Amazon (+43.79%), accompanied by decreasing dry‐season length.

 The carbon sequestration potential of open-ocean pelagic ecosystems is vastly under-reported compared to coastal vegetation ‘blue carbon’ systems. Here we show that just a single pelagic harvested species, Antarctic krill, sequesters a similar amount of carbon through its sinking faecal pellets as marshes, mangroves and seagrass. Due to their massive population biomass, fast-sinking faecal pellets and the modest depths that pellets need to reach to achieve sequestration (mean is 381 m), Antarctic krill faecal pellets sequester 20 MtC per productive season (spring to early Autumn). This is equates USD$ 4 − 46 billion depending on the price of carbon, with krill pellet carbon stored for at least 100 years and with some reaching as far as the North Pacific. Antarctic krill are being impacted by rapid polar climate change and an expanding fishery, thus krill populations and their habitat warrant protection to preserve this valuable carbon sink.

 DNA-protein interactions exert the fundamental structure of many pivotal biological processes, such as DNA replication, transcription, and gene regulation. However, accurate and efficient computational methods for identifying these interactions are still lacking. In this study, we propose a method ESM-DBP through refining the DNA-binding protein sequence repertory and domain-adaptive pretraining based the general protein language model. Our method considers the lacking exploration of general language model for DNA-binding protein domain-specific knowledge, so we screen out 170,264 DNA-binding protein sequences to construct the domain-adaptive language model. Experimental results on four downstream tasks show that ESM-DBP provides a better feature representation of DNA-binding protein compared to the original language model, resulting in improved prediction performance and outperforming the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, ESM-DBP can still perform well even for those sequences with only a few homologous sequences. ChIP-seq on two predicted cases further support the validity of the proposed method.

This study presents systematic study of angle-resolved and polarization-resolved magneto-optical photoluminescence spectra of NiPS3 in the Voigt geometry. We observed highly anisotropic, non-linear Zeeman splitting and polarization rotation of the Zhang-Rice exciton, which depends on the direction and intensity of the magnetic field and can be attributed to the spin-orbital coupling and field-induced spin reorientation.

 Effectively controlling the selective conversion of CO2 photoreduction to C2 products presents a significant challenge. Here, we develop a heterojunction photocatalyst by controllably implanting Au nanoparticles and single atoms into unsaturated Mo atoms of edge-rich MoS2, denoted as Aun/Au1-CMS. Photoreduction of CO2 results in the production of CH3COOH with a selectivity of 86.4%, which represents a 6.4-fold increase compared to samples lacking single atoms, and the overall selectivity for C2 products is 95.1%. Furthermore, the yield of CH3COOH is 22.4 times higher compared to samples containing single atoms and without nanoparticles. Optical experiments demonstrate that the single atoms domains can effectively capture photoexcited electrons by the Au nanoparticles, or the local electric field generated by the nanoparticles promotes the transfer of photogenerated electrons in MoS2 to Au single atoms, prolonging the relaxation time of photogenerated electrons. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the orbital coupling of Au5d and Mo4d strengthens the oxygen affinity of Mo and carbon affinity of Au. The hybridized orbitals reduce energy splitting levels of CO molecular orbitals, aiding C–C coupling. Moreover, the Mo−Au dual-site stabilize the crucial oxygen-associated intermediate *CH2CO, thereby enhancing the selectivity towards CH3COOH.

 Water structures at electrolyte/electrode interfaces play a crucial role in determining the selectivity and kinetics of electrochemical reactions. Despite extensive experimental and theoretical efforts, atomic-level details of ion-specific water structures on metal surfaces remain unclear. Here we show, using scanning tunneling microscopy and noncontact atomic force microscopy, that we can visualize water layers containing alkali metal cations on a charged Au(111) surface with atomic resolution. Our results reveal that Li+ cations are elevated from the surface, facilitating the formation of an ice-like water layer between the Li+ cations and the surface. In contrast, K+ and Cs+ cations are in direct contact with the surface. We observe that the water network structure transitions from a hexagonal arrangement with Li+ to a distorted hydrogen-bonding configuration with Cs+. These observations are consistent with surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy data and suggest that alkali metal cations significantly impact hydrogen evolution reaction kinetics and efficiency. Our findings provide insights into ion-specific water structures on metal surfaces and underscore the critical role of spectator ions in electrochemical processes.

 Carbon-based metal-free catalysts are promising green catalysts for photocatalysis and electrocatalysis due to their low cost and environmental friendliness.

Here we demonstrate the key structure of the double-bonded conjugated carbon group as a metal-free active site, enabling efficient O2 photoreduction to H2O2 through a cascaded water oxidation − O2 reduction process. Using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid as a precursor, we synthesized various carbon-based photocatalysts and analyzed their structural evolution.

 The East/Japan Sea (EJS), a marginal sea of the Northwestern Pacific, is one of the ocean regions showing the most rapid warming and greatest increases in ocean heatwaves over the last several decades. Predictability and skillful prediction of the summer season EJS variability are crucial, given the increasing severity of ocean temperature events impacting fisheries and reinforcing climate conditions like the East Asian rainy season, which in turn affects adjacent high-population density areas over East Asia. We use observations and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) Seamless System for Prediction and Earth System Research (SPEAR) seasonal forecast system to investigate the summertime EJS Sea Surface Temperature (SST) predictability and prediction skill. The observations and seasonal prediction system show that the summer season EJS SST can be closely linked to the previous winter air-sea coupling and predictable 8–9 months in advance. The SPEAR seasonal prediction system demonstrates skillful forecast of EJS SST events from summer to late fall, with added skill for long-lead forecasts initialized in winter. We find that winter large-scale atmospheric circulations linked to Barents Sea variability can induce persistent surface wind anomalies and corresponding northward Ekman heat transport over the East China Sea. The ocean advection anomalies that enter the EJS in prior seasons appear to play a role in developing anomalous SST during summer, along with instantaneous atmospheric forcing, as the source of long-lead predictability.

 Land surface temperature (LST) derived from satellite observations and weather modeling has been widely used for investigating Earth surface-atmosphere energy exchange and radiation budget. However, satellite-derived LST has a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions and missing observations caused by clouds, while there are limitations such as potential bias and expensive computation in model calibration and simulation for weather modeling. To mitigate those limitations, we proposed a WRFM framework to estimate LST at a spatial resolution of 1 km and temporal resolution of an hour by integrating the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and MODIS satellite data using the morphing technique. We tested the framework in eight counties, Iowa, USA, including urban and rural areas, to generate hourly LSTs from June 1st to August 31st, 2019, at a 1 km resolution. Upon evaluation with in-situ LST measurements, our WRFM framework has demonstrated its ability to capture hourly LSTs under both clear and cloudy conditions, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.63 K and 3.75 K, respectively. Additionally, the assessment with satellite LST observations has shown that the WRFM framework can effectively reduce the bias magnitude in LST from the WRF simulation, resulting in a reduction of the average RMSE over the study area from 4.34 K (daytime) and 4.12 K (nighttime) to 2.89 K (daytime) and 2.75 K (nighttime), respectively, while still capturing the hourly patterns of LST. Overall, the WRFM is effective in integrating the complementary advantages of satellite observations and weather modeling and can generate LSTs with high spatiotemporal resolutions in areas with complex landscapes (e.g., urban)."

 With the rapid development of LiDAR and artificial intelligence technologies, 3D point cloud semantic segmentation has become a highlight research topic.

However, current deep learning-based methods primarily rely on voxelization or multi-layer convolution for feature extraction. These methods often face challenges in effectively differentiating between homogeneous objects or structurally adherent targets in complex real-world scenes. To this end, we propose a Graph Transformer point cloud semantic segmentation network (ASGFormer) tailored for structurally adherent objects. Firstly, ASGFormer combines Graph and Transformer to promote global correlation understanding in the graph. Secondly, spatial index and position embedding are constructed based on distance relationships and feature differences. Through a learnable mechanism, the structural weights between points are dynamically adjusted, achieving adaptive spatial structure within the graph. Finally, dummy nodes are introduced to facilitate global information storage and transmission between layers, effectively addressing the issue of information loss at the terminal nodes of the graph.

This paper presents a novel Universal Adversarial Defense approach in Remote Sensing Imagery (UAD-RS), leveraging pre-trained diffusion models to protect DNNs against various adversarial examples exhibiting heterogeneous adversarial patterns. Specifically, a universal adversarial purification framework is developed utilizing pre-trained diffusion models to mitigate adversarial perturbations through the introduction of Gaussian noise and subsequent purification of the perturbations from adversarial examples. Additionally, an Adaptive Noise Level Selection (ANLS) mechanism is introduced to determine the optimal noise level for the purification framework with a task-guided Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) ranking strategy, thereby enhancing purification performance. Consequently, only a single pre-trained diffusion model is required for purifying various adversarial examples with heterogeneous adversarial patterns across each dataset, significantly reducing training efforts for multiple attack settings while maintaining high performance without prior knowledge of adversarial perturbations. Experimental results on four heterogeneous RS datasets, focusing on scene classification and semantic segmentation, demonstrate that UAD-RS outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial purification approaches, providing universal defense against seven commonly encountered adversarial perturbations. Codes and the pre-trained models are available online (https://github.com/EricYu97/UAD-RS)."
