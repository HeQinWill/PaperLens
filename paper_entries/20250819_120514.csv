H. Prevot,"Measurement report: Molecular composition, sources, and evolution of atmospheric organic aerosols in a basin city in China","We measured (at the molecular level) the 125 organic aerosol (OA) compounds present in Chengdu in winter. OA was dominated by fatty acids, phthalate esters, and anhydrosugars, and it was deeply influenced by anthropogenic sources. As pollution worsened, secondary inorganic species and secondary organic carbon (OC) dominated the increase in PM2.5, fatty acids and anhydrosugars dominated the increase in OA, and the contributions of secondary formation and biomass burning to OC increased markedly. 
 Although organic aerosols (OAs) have important impacts on the climate, environment, and human health, research on OAs in the Sichuan Basin (SCB), one of the heavily polluted areas in China, is still scarce. In this study, samples of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of ≤2.5 µm (PM2.5) were collected during winter 2023 in Chengdu, the capital city of Sichuan Province, and analyzed for organic compounds using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. The total average concentration of 125 organic compounds was 2013.4±902.4ngm-3 (mean ± standard deviation), and these compounds were dominated by fatty acids (28.9 %), phthalate esters (28.4 %), and anhydrosugars (18.0 %). Anthropogenic sources, such as fossil fuel and biomass burning, were the main sources of aliphatic lipids. Softwood burning was the main source of anhydrosugars. Although both are related to the aging of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), oxygenated PAHs and phthalic acids demonstrated different generation mechanisms. The isoprene secondary OA (SOA) tracers were strongly affected by NOx, relative humidity, and aerosol acidity. Biomass burning was an important source of biogenic SOA tracers. Tracer-based methods revealed that anthropogenic sources (11.6 %), β-caryophyllene (11.0 %), and biomass burning (10.0 %) were important sources of organic carbon (OC).  Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis demonstrated that secondary formation (22.2 %) was the greatest source of OC, followed by dust (20.4 %), vehicular emissions (17.6 %), plastic-related sources (17.4 %), biomass burning (11.3 %), coal combustion (6.2 %), and primary biogenic emissions (5.0 %). As pollution worsened, the proportions of secondary inorganic species and secondary OC in PM2.5 increased substantially; PMF analyses indicated that the OC increase was caused mainly by secondary formation and biomass burning. These results are of great value with respect to understanding the characteristics and formation mechanisms of OA as well as the contribution of OA to air pollution in the SCB."

Kotarba;Agnieszka Wypych,Evaluation of the operational MODIS cloud mask product for detecting cirrus clouds,"Clouds affect Earth's energy balance, with high-altitude cirrus clouds contributing to atmospheric warming. While active satellite sensors are the most accurate for detecting cirrus clouds, they are not ideal for long-term studies. This study compares Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) data, testing six MODIS methods, one MODIS-based test, and two International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) tests. The all tests consolidation (ATC) was the most effective, achieving 72.98 % accuracy during daytime and 59.50 % at night, making it relatively accurate for creating a cirrus mask. 
 All clouds influence the Earth's radiative budget, with their net radiative forcing being negative. However, high-level clouds warrant special attention due to their atmospheric warming effects. A comprehensive characterization of cirrus clouds requires information on their coverage, which can be obtained from various data types. Active satellite sensors (lidars) are presently the most accurate source for cirrus data, but their usefulness in climatological studies is limited (the narrow view and 16 d repeat cycle yield only ∼20 observations per year per region, often insufficient for climatological studies). On the contrary, passive data, which have been available for the past 40 years with sufficient temporal resolution for climatological research, are less effective at detecting cirrus clouds compared to active vertical profiling sensors. In this study, we assessed the utility of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) standard products for creating a cirrus mask by validating them against Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization  (CALIOP) data. Our objective was to determine how well the operational cloud mask from the MODIS Science Team can be used to infer the presence of cirrus clouds relative to data products derived from the highly sensitive CALIOP instrument by the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) Science Team.Using CALIOP data as the reference, we evaluated six tests for cirrus and high cloud detection considered in the MODIS cloud masking algorithm and their combination (all tests consolidation, ATC). Additionally, we applied classifications based on the cirrus definition from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP), which rely on retrieved MODIS cloud-top properties. These were used not as detection tests but as a classification scheme for comparative purposes. All other tests were applied directly to MODIS radiances.The study revealed that ATC was the most effective, resulting in an overall accuracy of 72.98 % (probability of detection 80.9 %, false alarm rate 34.9 %, Cohen's κ 0.46) during the daytime and 59.50 % at night (probability of detection 25.5 %, false alarm rate 6.9 %, Cohen's κ 0.19). However, its effectiveness was notably reduced during the nighttime compared to during the daytime. We conclude that the MODIS operational Cloud Mask after being modified into ATC is moderately suitable for creating a mask of high-level clouds and only during the daytime. During the nighttime, MODIS ATC fails to reliably report the presence of cirrus."

I developed a new-generation internal tide model, ZHAO30yr, using 30 years of satellite altimetry data. ZHAO30yr contains 12  (eight mode-1 and four mode-2) internal tide constituents. ZHAO30yr decomposes the global internal tide field and reveals numerous long-range beams that contain important information on their generation, propagation, and dissipation. 
 An internal tide model, ZHAO30yr, is developed using 30 years of satellite altimetry sea surface height (SSH) measurements from 1993 to 2022 by a recently improved mapping technique that consists of two rounds of plane wave analysis with a spatial bandpass filter in between. Prerequisite wavelengths are calculated using climatological annual mean hydrographic profiles in the World Ocean Atlas 2018. ZHAO30yr only extracts the 30-year phase-locked internal tide component, lacking the incoherent component caused by the time-varying ocean environment. The model contains 12 internal tide constituents: eight mode-1 constituents (M2, S2, N2, K2, K1, O1, P1, and Q1) and four mode-2 constituents (M2, S2, K1, and O1). Model errors are estimated to be lower than 1 mm in the SSH amplitude on  global average, thanks to the long data record and improved mapping technique. The model is evaluated by making internal tide correction to independent altimetry data for 2023. A total of 10 constituents (but for K2 and Q1) can reduce variance on  global average. K2 and Q1 can only cause variance reductions in their source regions. The model decomposes the multiconstituent, multimodal, multidirectional internal tide field into a series of simple plane waves at each grid point. The decomposition reveals unprecedented features previously masked by multiwave interference. The model divides each internal tide constituent into components by propagation direction. The directionally decomposed components show numerous long-range internal tidal beams associated with notable topographic features. The semidiurnal internal tidal beams off the Amazon shelf and the diurnal internal tidal beams in the Arabian Sea are examined in detail.  ZHAO30yr is available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28078523 (Zhao, 2024b). Model errors are available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28559978.v3 (Zhao, 2025)."

It combines weather data and site-specific environmental information to support forecasting groundwater changes. Three benchmark models of varying complexity show how data and modeling approaches influence predictions. This resource promotes open, reproducible research and helps guide future water management decisions. 
 We present GEMS-GER (Groundwater Levels, Environment, Meteorology, Site Properties), the first benchmark dataset specifically designed for machine learning applications in long-term groundwater level modeling in Germany. The dataset comprises 32 years of gapless weekly observations from 3,207 monitoring wells, enriched with meteorological forcing variables and more than 50 site-specific static attributes. All data have undergone extensive preprocessing, including harmonization, outlier removal, and iterative imputation, to ensure high quality and suitability for machine learning applications. The wells are spatially distributed across Germany and cover diverse hydrogeological settings and aquifer types. To demonstrate the utility of the dataset, we provide three initial benchmark models: a single-well CNN model, a global LSTM model using dynamic inputs, and a global LSTM model incorporating both dynamic and static features. The best-performing model achieves satisfactory predictive performance (NSE > 0.5) for more than half (52 %) of the wells, which is considered a strong result in the context of groundwater modeling."

To model these errors accurately, it is necessary to use a signal tracing algorithm which is informed of the state of the atmosphere. We developed such an algorithm and tested it by processing Global Navigation Satellite System network observations. Our algorithm's main advantage is lossless utilization of atmospheric information provided by numerical weather prediction models. 
 Electromagnetic signals commonly used in geodetic applications, such as the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), undergo bending and delay in the neutral gas atmosphere of the Earth. The least travel time (LTT) concept is one of the approaches to model signal slant delays via a ray tracing (RT) procedure. In this study, we developed an LTT-based RT algorithm (LTT v2), where the three-dimensional refractivity field of the atmosphere is based on the atmospheric model data. This representation is complete in a sense that the domain of the RT conforms to the native grid geometry of the atmospheric model. In principle, the LTT-based RT algorithm is seen as an extension of an atmospheric model for signal delay evaluation. The atmospheric states are generated using a global numerical weather prediction model, the Open Integrated Forecast System of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. In the LTT v2 model, some physical and numerical approximations are improved compared to the original implementation, called “LTT v1”. We compare the slant delays products of the two models. Additionally, a comparable modelling setup is created with the state-of-the-art VieVS Ray Tracer (RADIATE). The skill of slant delay estimation is assessed using metrics that are indicative of the quality of GNSS products derived using the GROOPS (Gravity Recovery Object Oriented Programming System) orbit solver software toolkit of the Graz University of Technology. The metrics used are GNSS orbit midnight discontinuities (MDs) and residuals of ground station precise positioning with respect to the IGS14 reference. Employment of slant delay products of the LTT RT algorithm in GNSS processing shows similar performance with v1 and v2. The GNSS orbit MDs are reduced by around 3 % when using the LTT v2 model, while root-mean-square residuals of ground station precise positioning are 5 % lower with LTT v1. The consistency of both metrics is improved slightly using LTT v2, as seen by the metrics' standard deviation values. Intercomparison with RADIATE indicates significantly better performance of LTT v2, which we attribute entirely to the much larger amount and lossless utilization of weather model data as input to LTT v2 versus RADIATE."

Padhye;Peizhe Sun,Iodine Species Quantification and Transformation during Chlorination in the Presence of Ammonia,"Iodinated disinfection byproducts (I-DBPs) are increasingly detected in drinking water due to the widespread use of chlorination and the presence of iodide (I–) in source waters. However, understanding the transformation of iodine species during disinfection remains challenging, particularly under varying ammonia concentrations. In this study, a method based on spectrophotometry and HPLC was applied to quantify I–, hypoiodous acid (HOI), and iodate (IO3–) in various water matrices. With this method, the transformation of iodide during breakpoint chlorination was elucidated for the first time. Results revealed that ammonia inhibited IO3– formation by scavenging free chlorine and promoted the accumulation of HOI, a key intermediate in I-DBPs formation. A comprehensive kinetic model was established, which accurately reproduced the experimental trends and helped elucidate the transformation mechanisms of iodine species. Additionally, the fate of organic iodine compounds, including 4-iodobenzoic acid and diatrizoate (DTZ, a widely used iodinated contrast medium), was examined during breakpoint chlorination. Although typically considered resistant to chlorination, both compounds underwent partial degradation under Cl2/N = 2 conditions, leading to iodide release and enhanced I-DBPs formation. This highlights the risk of converting stable iodine-containing organics into reactive species under high chlorine doses in ammonia-containing water. These findings highlight the importance of precisely controlling ammonia and disinfectant concentrations to reduce water toxicity and ensure safer water disinfection practices."

The degradation of three NBHCs with different nitrogen atoms, benzotriazole (BTA), indazole (IDZ), and indole (IDO), and N-DBP formation during the ultraviolet light-emitting diode (UV-LED)/chlorine process deserve to be investigated. The extremely rapid IDO degradation was attributed to a fast electrophilic substitution of chlorine at the 3-position of the IDO molecule. Dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN) was the most dominant N-DBP during the UV-LED/chlorine treatment of the three NBHCs. DCAN yields from IDO, containing one nitrogen atom, were 3.5 and 36.4 times higher than those from BTA, with three nitrogen atoms, and IDZ, with two nitrogen atoms, respectively. The possible important roles of HO• and Cl• were identified in the DCAN formation for the three NBHCs. Especially, more elaborate possible pathways for DCAN formation were proposed: the pyrrole ring of IDO opened, or the triazole ring of BTA underwent N2 elimination to form chlorinated (hydroxyimino)cyclohex-ene-dione, and then ring-opening took place to gradually form DCAN. Particularly, the pyrrole ring of IDO can form DCAN directly. These can provide useful references and open ideas for research on DCAN formation from other NBHCs and their derivatives by free radicals."

Photocatalytic degradation emerged as a sustainable solution, but it still suffers from sluggish reaction kinetics and insufficient C–F bond cleavage. Addressing the above bottlenecks, we strategically constructed frustrated Lewis acid–base pairs (FLP) on In2O3 photocatalyst, which theoretically reduces the PFOA decarboxylation energy by 2.91 eV. The rationally designed In2O3–FLP photocatalyst achieved a 23-fold improvement of PFOA degradation rate, a 9-fold increase of defluorination rate, and a 1.6-fold increase of mineralization efficiency compared to pristine In2O3. Mechanistic studies reveal that the frustrated Lewis acid (LA) and Lewis base (LB) synergistically facilitate PFOA degradation by enhancing adsorption, promoting charge transfer, and enabling in situ defluorination. This work elucidates mechanistic insights into dual-active-site catalysis via FLP in photocatalytic decarboxylation and proposes a rational photocatalyst design strategy for persistent pollutant remediation."

Field studies reveal that birds bioaccumulate PFAS through ecosystem exposures. However, drivers of PFAS exposures are poorly understood and may suffer from species and geographic biases due to the significant effort and cost of conducting field studies for measuring PFAS in wild birds. Therefore, alternative methods for assessing avian PFAS exposures are needed. Herein, we explore the utility of opportunistic sampling of building collision fatalities for expanding knowledge of PFAS exposures in wild birds. Concentrations of 40 PFAS of regulatory concern were measured in 50 livers from eight passerine species killed in building strikes during their migration through Chicago, IL. Results indicate that exposure is dominated by perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids, fluorotelomer carboxylic acids, and perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids and that physiological factors and feeding strategies may impact PFAS exposures. Comparing liver concentrations to those found in similar species at contaminated and noncontaminated sites indicates that PFAS levels detected in building collision fatalities are representative of levels found in wild populations, suggesting that this approach may circumvent challenges encountered in traditional bird biomonitoring studies and offer opportunities for more detailed study of factors governing PFAS exposure and bioaccumulation."

This study investigated the distribution, migration, and risk of microplastics in source water (lakes, reservoirs, and rivers), drinking water (tap water and well water), and water treatment plant (WTP) across 15 rural regions in Southwest China. Microplastics were ubiquitously detected in all of the samples. Three risk models demonstrated a significantly lower microplastic risk in tap water relative to source water, while well water posed the highest risk. In five regions, microplastic abundance increased and polymer types diversified from the source to tap water, suggesting microplastic release from the water distribution system. Coagulation-sedimentation and ultrafiltration in the WTP removed 65.9% and 100% of the microplastics, respectively. However, backwashing led to the release of the retained microplastics. Correlation, regression, and principal component analyses revealed that the TOC and turbidity were the key factors associated with microplastic abundance. Five metal ions exhibited removal patterns similar to those of microplastics in water treatment. Rural residents may ingest 913 microplastic particles annually by consuming 1 L of tap water every day. This study provides valuable insights into the fate of microplastics in rural drinking water."

Our results show no major trends in the occurrence of this pattern over the past millennium. We further show that La Niña winters often precede a wave5 event the following summer, evident over centuries. This pattern was exemplified by the La Niña winter of 2022–2023, which was followed by wave5‐driven compound heatwaves in July.

As nitrogen dioxide (NO2) observations can enhance CO2 emission estimates, we use NO2 observations from twin polar‐orbiting satellites (GaoFen‐5B and DaQi‐1) to constrain carbon emission estimates based on the OCO‐3 XCO2 measurements. Compared previous CO2 estimation constrained by polar‐orbiting satellites (e.g., Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument), this approach detects 40% more daily emission cases and reduces uncertainties by up to 12%, primarily due to reduced temporal differences and increased observation frequency. The improved estimates cover 69 global emission cases, mainly in East Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and North America.

Linking satellite retrievals with socioeconomic or health data involves matching the irregularly shaped satellite observations with administrative units. Here, we develop a physics‐based approach to spatially oversample nitrogen dioxide (NO2) retrievals from TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) directly to United States (US) neighborhoods (i.e., block groups). The physics‐based oversampling approach considers each satellite pixel as a sensitivity distribution, meaning that satellite instruments are more sensitive to the neighborhoods at the center than at the edge of the observations. We show that directly oversampling satellite observations to administrative shapes is a more accurate and computationally efficient approach than the commonly used gridding approaches, and it is advantageous for shorter temporal windows. Combining the newly developed NO2 data set with demographic data, we find widespread racial/ethnic and income‐related NO2 disparities across the US. NO2 disparities are even more pronounced during the most polluted days, suggesting greater acute health effects for overburdened communities. We expect that the resolution‐adaptive, neighborhood‐level, and GIS‐compatible NO2 data set would lower barriers of the public to access and interpret satellite observations, facilitating the actionable applications of satellite observations."

Here, authors show a comprehensive cellular atlas illustrating detailed neuron distribution and communication patterns across cortical regions. 
 A high-resolution spatial physiological atlas of cortical neurons serves as an essential reference for studying neurological diseases and is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the cortical functions and physiological mechanisms. Although previous studies have elucidated the cellular basis of individual cortex, the molecular characteristics and precise spatial organization of neural cells within multiple human cortex remain incompletely understood. Subcellular-level spatial transcriptomic sequencing and snRNA-seq enabled mapping of 14 human cortical regions, creating a single-cell atlas with transcriptomic data from 1,121,772 nuclei and spatial profiles from 1,888,306 cells to characterize neural cell organization. The atlas reveals distinct expression patterns and spatial arrangements of neural cell types. Glutamatergic neurons show precise laminar patterns, with similar expression in adjacent cortex. SST neurons fall into two transcriptional categories, corresponding to superficial and deep layer distributions. The atlas, integrated with functional networks, highlights correlations between neural cell types and cortical functions, uncovering cell-cell interactions and ligand-receptor patterns with regional differences in neuron-glia communication.

 Acute kidney injury (AKI) can lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD), a transition driven by cellular senescence, a state of irreversible cell-cycle arrest. However, the molecular mechanisms promoting this pathological process remain unclear. Here we show that the channel protein Pannexin1 (Panx1) promotes this detrimental senescence and subsequent kidney fibrosis. We found that Panx1 functions in a noncanonical role as a calcium (Ca2+) leak channel within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a key intracellular calcium store. This Panx1-mediated leak occurs at contact sites between the ER and mitochondria, leading to mitochondrial calcium overload, dysfunction, and the generation of pro-senescence signals. Genetically deleting Panx1 in male mouse models of AKI attenuates renal senescence and fibrosis. These findings, validated in human kidney tissue, identify ER-resident Panx1 as a critical driver of kidney disease progression and a potential therapeutic target.

Using CRISPRi screens, the authors revealed that the carbapenemase OXA-48 has a role in the plasmid-associated fitness costs. 
 Conjugative plasmids are the main vehicle for the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in clinical bacteria. AMR plasmids allow bacteria to survive antibiotic treatments, but they also produce physiological alterations in their hosts that commonly translate into fitness costs. Despite the key role of plasmid-associated fitness effects in AMR evolution, their origin and molecular bases remain poorly understood. In this study, we introduce plasmid-wide CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screens as a tool to dissect plasmid-associated fitness effects. We design and perform CRISPRi screens targeting the globally distributed carbapenem resistance plasmid pOXA-48 in 13 different multidrug resistant clinical Enterobacterales. Our results reveal that pOXA-48 gene-level effects are conserved across clinical strains, and expose the key role of the carbapenemase-encoding gene, blaOXA-48, as the main culprit for pOXA-48 fitness costs. Moreover, our results highlight the relevance of postsegregational killing systems in pOXA-48 vertical transmission, and uncover new genes implicated in pOXA-48 stability (pri, korC, DNDJGHEP_13 and 14 and H-NS).

 Archean cratons represent stable continental domains which form the nuclei of the Earth’s continents due to their thick ( >200 km), mechanically resistant keels. Cratons and their stable roots form through melt and fluid depletion processes. However, metasomatic refertilization may occur due to processes coeval with craton construction and/or overprinting episodes. Magnetotellurics, a geophysical method measuring subsurface electrical resistivity, is sensitive to the compositional and thermal states of the lithosphere and is useful in mapping depleted and refertilized cratonic domains. Here we show the results of a 3D anisotropic inversion to image the lithospheric resistivity structure of the western Superior Craton. The resistivity model reveals widespread (500×300 km2) anisotropy with a north-south conductive axis at depths ~100–200 km, inferred to represent phlogopite-bearing channels emplaced during mantle plume activity. The results have implications for our understanding of the modification and long-term stability of cratonic lithosphere, and the imaging and interpretation of their preserved geophysical signatures.

 Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), a critical determinant of crop productivity and agricultural sustainability, varies significantly between indica and japonica subspecies. Here, we identify three coding-region SNPs in OsNLP4 underlying this divergence. These SNPs enhance the binding affinity of OsNLP4indica to nitrate response elements (NREs), amplifying transcriptional activation of nitrogen metabolism and iron homeostasis genes. Introgression of the OsNLP4indica allele into elite japonica cultivar XS134 increases both grain yield and NUE by 12–25% across multi-location field trials under varying nitrogen regimes. Heterologous expression in Arabidopsis increases shoot biomass by 23%, demonstrating possible conservation of function in dicots. Mechanistically, the indica allele’s stronger NRE-binding capacity synergistically modulates downstream pathways. Furthermore, combining OsNLP4indica with balanced nitrogen-iron fertilization boosts NUE by 30–32%.

 Diverse genetic structures can lead to heterogeneity among GWAS summary datasets from distinct populations. This makes it more difficult to infer causal effects of exposures on the outcome when multiple GWAS summary datasets are integrated. Here, we propose a Mendelian randomization method called MR-EILLS, which leverages environment invariant linear least squares to establish whether there is a causal relationship that is invariant in all heterogeneous populations. The MR-EILLS model works in both univariate and multivariate scenarios and allows for invalid instrumental variables that violate the exchangeability and exclusion restriction assumptions. In addition, MR-EILLS shows the unbiased causal effect estimations of one or multiple exposures on the outcome, whether there are valid or invalid instrumental variables. Compared to traditional Mendelian randomization and meta methods, MR-EILLS yields the highest estimation accuracy, the most stable type I error rates, and the highest statistical power. Finally, we apply MR-EILLS to explore the independent causal relationships between 11 blood cells and 20 disease-related outcomes, using GWAS summary statistics from five ancestries (African, East Asian, South Asian, Hispanic/Latino and European). The results cover most of the expected causal links that have biological interpretations as well as additional links supported by previous observational studies.

 Terrestrial ecosystems currently sequester around one-third of the anthropogenic carbon emitted each year, slowing the pace of climate change.

Here we review plant nutrient acquisition strategies and evidence of the enhanced utilization of these strategies under experimental and real-world elevated CO2. Many of the strategies that are key to alleviating nutrient limitation under elevated CO2 are not well represented in current Earth system models, and a simple data-driven analysis implies that models that do not account for nutrient acquisition strategies could underestimate the land sink.

 Coastal regions are highly vulnerable to tropical cyclones (TCs), with the severity of damage often closely linked to the duration of storms over these areas. Here we show a significant increase in TC residence time along the Chinese coast, with an average rise of approximately 2.5 h per decade since the 1980s. While the overall translation speed of TCs does not show any significant trend, their travel distances within coastal zones have increased markedly, rising by about 32.9 km per decade. This trend is particularly pronounced in the southern coastal region (south of 26°N), where TC tracks exhibit a counterclockwise rotation to become more parallel to the coastline since the 1980s. A concomitant counterclockwise rotation in the steering flow near this region is also observed, which is likely driven by the northward shift of the western Pacific subtropical high.

Using station-based observations, we confirm that ARs have driven coherent long-term trends in both total and extreme precipitation over land. The warming-induced rise in atmospheric moisture alone accounts for an AR frequency increase of ~0.6–0.8% per decade. AR trends exhibit meridional dipolar patterns over western North America and Europe, governed by positive trends of the Pacific-North America Pattern and North Atlantic Oscillation. The “Pineapple Express” ARs have been suppressed, declining of AR landfalling over the Pacific Northwest.

 Organic aerosols (OA) play critical roles in atmospheric chemistry, air quality, climate forcing, and public health.

Advances in high-resolution mass spectrometry, particularly when coupled with specialized inlets such as the Filter Inlet for Gases and Aerosols (FIGAERO) and Extractive Electrospray Ionization (EESI), have enabled real-time molecular-level analysis of both gas- and particle-phase organics. These developments have substantially improved insights into OA composition, physicochemical properties, sources, and formation pathways. This review critically assesses recent progress in widely used analytical techniques for molecular characterization of OA and their applications in ambient air, emission sources, and indoor environments. Parameterizations of key OA properties, including volatility, viscosity, and hygroscopicity based on molecular data are summarized. Recent findings on secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation mechanisms, including homogeneous oxidation, heterogeneous processing, and gas-particle partitioning, are discussed.

Shepherd,The concept of spectrally nudged storylines for extreme event attribution,"Spectrally nudged storylines are innovative methods for attributing extreme weather events to anthropogenic climate change, which can address the limitations of conventional probabilistic attribution methods by focusing on specific historical events with significant impacts. 
 Spectrally nudged storylines (constraining the large-scale atmospheric circulation to follow that of a particular weather event) represent a relatively new attribution method. They differ from conventional, probabilistic attribution approaches which consider a class of similar, generally univariate, extremes. Instead, their focus is on particular, historic extreme events of large impact which are still vividly anchored in collective memory. The innovation of the method is the feasibility to quantify the role of anthropogenic climate change for specific extreme events of the recent past, and it draws on experience from regional climate downscaling. Spectrally nudged storylines thus offer a new, easily implemented and easily understandable way of communicating climate change to the general public and decision-makers, as well as a pathway for detailed attribution of climate impacts. The technique offers great potential as an addition to the established attribution methods by answering different questions and providing new attribution results. Spectrally nudged storylines are innovative methods for attributing extreme weather events to anthropogenic climate change, which can address the limitations of conventional probabilistic attribution methods by focusing on specific historical events with significant impacts."

 Despite investments in disaster resilience, flooding continues to disrupt healthcare systems, both by limiting access and through failures in the surrounding transportation network. Existing models for mitigation planning often overlook critical dynamics, such as traffic rerouting, particularly at the national scales necessary for effective planning. Here we present a scalable method to identify hospitals at risk of emergency response delays and service disruptions caused by flood-induced traffic impacts. Our approach integrates a regional flood model with a gravity-based traffic model to simulate traffic flow from open-source road data. Our findings reveal hidden risks for hospitals located far from flood zones, showing how flood-related road disruptions and traffic rerouting can reduce access to critical healthcare services. In particular, we found 75 (of 2,475) hospitals at risk of patient surges beyond their regular capacity, driven solely by flood-related traffic disruptions. Of these, a third are more than 10 km from the nearest inundation, suggesting these facilities may be unaware and thus under-prepared — risks that have, until now, remained hidden from assessments. Across Germany, flood-driven traffic detours can double patient demand at one in thirty hospitals, even those more than 10 kilometers from the nearest inundation, according to an analysis that utilizes a national-scale 5-meter resolution flood-traffic model."

 Ground rainfall observations are essential for improving gauge-adjusted satellite precipitation estimates, particularly in the Global Precipitation Measurement mission era. However, over 60% of countries lack a complete surface-based rainfall gauge network, severely constraining the accuracy of global satellite precipitation retrievals. Here we present a model that integrates regional-scale intelligent optimization, topographic analysis, and an end-to-end neural network to merge multi-source precipitation data and reconstruct global spatiotemporal precipitation fields with resolved data gaps across scales. Our evaluation demonstrates that the model substantially improves satellite precipitation accuracy, increasing the correlation coefficient from 0.66 to 0.77. In particular, satellite estimates at high rain rates and over complex terrains show marked improvement when the model is applied. These findings suggest that the proposed approach holds strong potential for future applications in storm monitoring and flood forecasting, especially in mountainous regions with sparse observational data.

 In this work, a simple physics-informed stochastic earthquake catalog simulator is presented for the modeling of long memory on a single fault (or crustal volume). The simulator combines the fundamental statistical laws of seismology (i.e., the Gutenberg-Richter law and the exponential distribution of inter-event times of spontaneous events) with two physical assumptions: 1) earthquake magnitudes are constrained by the amount of potential energy accumulated within the crustal volume at a given time, 2) existence of an upper boundary for stress on the fault. The consequence is a deviation from the conventional exponential inter-event distribution. We analyze a set of simulated catalogs to inspect long memory. Our results show that, depending on the relative proportion of energy accumulation and release, catalogs can exhibit complex patterns and long memory behavior. Despite its simplicity, our simulator can replicate the key features of seismic activity observed in real data, thus enabling a consistent physical interpretation.

 Ocean warming, which affects the ocean hydrodynamic environment, changes marine ecosystems, and impacts both regional and global climates, has been widely observed in recent decades. However, the effects on deep circulation in the Pacific Ocean and its marginal seas, such as the South China Sea, have rarely been reported. Here we assess circulation responses in the South China Sea at depths exceeding 2 400 m via reanalysis datasets and numerical simulations. The results suggest that ocean warming has weakened circulation in the deep ocean in recent decades. The variation in circulation is driven by changes in the horizontal density gradient. However, warming also enhances diapycnal diffusivity, which can accelerate circulation, counteracting deep circulation weakening to some extent. Understanding regional responses to deep ocean circulation plays an essential role in advancing future global scale understanding of hydrodynamic changes, with implications for climate change and economic consequences.

 Several paleoclimatic reconstructions have indicated that the mid-Holocene (6,000 years before present) was characterized by stronger east-west temperature contrast and lower El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability relative to the present day. While climate models show a reduction in ENSO variability, they underestimate this reduction compared to paleoclimate reconstructions. Further, the drivers behind these changes remain unclear. Here we use five global climate models to show that incorporating vegetation changes over northern Africa during the mid-Holocene amplifies the orbitally-driven strengthening of the West African Monsoon, warms the tropical north Atlantic, and nudges it to an Atlantic Niño-like mean state. Changes over the Atlantic lead to a La Niña-like mean state over the tropical Pacific, with reductions in interannual variability amplified by up to 18% in the Niño3.4 region due to the Green Sahara alone. Our work highlights the importance of the Atlantic influence on ENSO and provides paleoclimatic evidence for this synergistic teleconnection.

 Landslides forming in active rifts are typically small. Here we use broadband seismic data to unravel an exceptionally large (340 km2) landslide in the buried North Sea paleorift. The landslide formed by gravity-driven collapse of a > 2.5 km high fault-generated footwall crest of crystalline basement rocks. ~300 km3 of rocks moved ca. 8 km on a low-angle detachment, creating the largest known rift landslide worldwide. At the time of sliding, rift tectonics had transformed a low-relief denudation surface to a high relief Basin and Range-style topography. This topography developed at an early (Late Permian) stage due to rapid fault accumulation and large associated footwall uplift under arid denudation-suppressing climatic conditions. Lower Triassic burial of the collapsed crest occurred as a new rift-bounding fault, the Øygarden Fault, was established to the east. This study demonstrates that although rare, huge landslides can form in active rift settings.

 Secondary mangrove forests are ecosystems that regenerate in areas where original mangrove stands have been degraded or removed as a result of natural disturbances or anthropogenic activities. Compared to mature mangrove forests, secondary stands exhibit enhanced carbon accumulation, increased sediment trapping efficiency, and intensified nitrogen fixation, contributing significantly to coastal eutrophication mitigation. Accurately mapping secondary mangroves and determining their age is essential for sustainable ecosystem management and assessing their services. However, reliably determining mangrove forest age using remote sensing has been hindered by the complex dynamics of intertidal environments. To overcome these challenges, we developed a robust and efficient approach for estimating the age of secondary mangrove forests (ASMF) by integrating Landsat time-series data and the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm. We implemented this method in the Dongzhaigang National Nature Reserve (DNNR), which is the first mangrove nature reserve established in China, achieving a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.723. Key findings include: (1) the ASMF estimates exhibited high accuracy (R2 = 0.723), with optimal performance for forests aged 9–10 years; (2) secondary mangrove forests comprised 47 % (823.87 ha) of the total mangrove area within the DNNR; and (3) younger stands (1–9 years) represented 32 % of all secondary mangrove forests. This approach offers an effective solution for regional-scale mangrove age estimation and provides a critical basis for evaluating the carbon sequestration potential of secondary mangroves in the DNNR."

 Full-waveform airborne LiDAR bathymetry (ALB) technology, in which the analyzed waveforms reflect the temporal positions and attribute information of targets, is effective in shallow water. However, weak seafloor echoes in full-waveform data induced by environmental and device characteristics are confused with noise signals, leading to difficulties in seafloor detection. This paper proposes a pregeneration–recognition method of detecting weak seafloor echoes for ALB. First, a two-stage local maximum algorithm is developed to identify potential seafloor echoes in waveforms and to pregenerate points. Then, an adaptive ellipsoidal neighborhood related to the point density is used to select neighborhood points, and eigenvalue-based spatial features are calculated. Finally, a back propagation neural network (BPNN) model is constructed using the points generated from surface–seafloor shots, and the seafloor points in seafloor-undefined shots are obtained by optimizing the BPNN results. The proposed method is verified on four swaths collected via the Optech Aquarius ALB system near Wuzhizhou Island and Ganquan Island in the South China Sea. The numbers of additional points detected with the proposed method near these two islands increase by 195.9 % and 40.1 % compared with the Aquarius system, which is better than the Richardson–Lucy deconvolution method. The coverages and maximum depth of seafloor points are improved and the accuracy evaluations demonstrate the credibility of the results. Therefore, the proposed pregeneration–recognition method can effectively improve the detection rate for weak seafloor echoes and the depth performance of ALB systems. Future research will focus on mitigating the impact of seafloor topography on the proposed method to expand its application scenarios."
