In many countries, including the United States, the current precipitation information used for designing stormwater infrastructure does not include estimates or guidance for designing under climate change. In the contiguous United States, updated precipitation estimates that may be available in 2027 would include adjustment factors to account for climate change, but precipitation estimates also need to explicitly include guidelines for responsible use of precipitation information. We provide practical recommendations for using current precipitation estimates to plan and design climate resilient stormwater infrastructure in the United States until updated precipitation estimates are available. We also recommend guidelines to accompany updated estimates to facilitate the responsible use of precipitation information."
10.5194/acp-25-8591-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该论文主要研究加拿大农村地区大气中气态汞的来源，重点区分自然地表排放（如野火和再排放）和人为排放对总气态汞的贡献。研究使用了长期观测数据和PMF模型来分析2005年至2018年间排放趋势。虽然涉及大气成分的分析，但它更侧重于源解析和长期趋势分析，而非大气环境遥感技术本身，如空气质量监测或卫星观测。,"['total gaseous mercury (TGM)', 'natural surface emissions', 'anthropogenic emissions', 'positive matrix factorization (PMF)', 'Canadian Air and Precipitation Monitoring Network (CAPMoN)']",Irene Cheng;Amanda Cole;Leiming Zhang;Alexandra Steffen,Natural surface emissions dominate anthropogenic emissions contributions to total gaseous mercury at Canadian rural sites,"Using the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model and observations, we showed that natural surface emission (wildfires and re-emitted Hg) dominated anthropogenic contributions to total gaseous mercury (TGM). Decreasing TGM was due to reduced shipping, local combustion, and regional emissions. Relative contributions from natural surface emissions increased by 0.3–1.8 % yr-1. Results showed Hg control measures have been effective, but greater attention is needed for monitoring surface re-emissions. 
 The Canadian Air and Precipitation Monitoring Network (CAPMoN) measures total gaseous mercury (TGM) at three rural–remote sites. Long-term TGM measurements, ancillary measurements, and the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model were used to assess temporal changes in anthropogenic and natural surface emission (wildfires plus re-emitted Hg) contributions to TGM and examine the emission drivers of the observed TGM trends between 2005 and 2018. TGM showed decreasing trends at all sites; the magnitudes (ng m−3 yr−1) were −0.050 at Saturna for 2010–2015, −0.026 at Egbert for 2005–2018, and −0.014 at Kejimkujik for 2005–2016. The increasing contributions from natural surface Hg emissions at Saturna (1.8 % yr−1) and Kejimkujik (0.3 % yr−1) resulted from declining anthropogenic Hg emissions and increasing oceanic re-emissions. The mean relative contributions of natural surface emissions to annual TGM were 71 %, 77.5 %, and 64 % at Saturna, Egbert, and Kejimkujik. TGM at Saturna was mainly from the Hg pool (50 %), terrestrial re-emissions (26 %), and shipping (10 %); at Egbert, from the Hg pool (66 %), terrestrial re-emissions (24 %), and crustal/soil dust (5 %); and at Kejimkujik, from the Hg pool (81 %), regional Hg emissions (11 %), and oceanic re-emissions (8 %). Local combustion contributed a few percent of the annual TGM, while the oceanic re-emission contribution was 6 %–8 % for the two coastal sites. Wildfire impacts on annual TGM were 3.7 % for Saturna and 1.6 % for Egbert. The Hg pool contributions to TGM were greater in the cold season, whereas wildfire and surface re-emission contributions can be significant in the warm season."

Stoy,Ozone dry deposition through plant stomata: multi-model com]parison with flux observations and  the role of water stress as part of AQMEII4 Activity 2,"Vegetation removes tropospheric ozone through stomatal uptake, and accurately modeling the stomatal uptake of ozone is important for modeling dry deposition and air quality. We evaluated the stomatal component of ozone dry deposition modeled by atmospheric chemistry models at six sites. We find that models and observation-based estimates agree at times during the growing season at all sites, but some models overestimated the stomatal component during the dry summers at a seasonally dry site. 
 A substantial portion of tropospheric O3 dry deposition occurs after diffusion of O3 through plant stomata. Simulating stomatal uptake of O3 in 3D atmospheric chemistry models is important in the face of increasing drought-induced declines in stomatal conductance and enhanced ambient O3. Here, we present a comparison of the stomatal component of O3 dry deposition (egs) from chemical transport models and estimates of egs from observed CO2, latent heat, and O3 flux. The dry deposition schemes were configured as single-point models forced with data collected at flux towers. We conducted sensitivity analyses to study the impact of model parameters that control stomatal moisture stress on modeled egs. Examining six sites around the Northern Hemisphere, we find that the seasonality of observed flux-based egs agrees with the seasonality of simulated egs at times during the growing season, with disagreements occurring during the later part of the growing season at some sites. We find that modeled water stress effects are too strong in a temperate–boreal transition forest. Some single-point models overestimate summertime egs in a seasonally water-limited Mediterranean shrubland. At all sites examined, modeled egs was sensitive to parameters that control the vapor pressure deficit stress. At specific sites that experienced substantial declines in soil moisture, the simulation of egs was highly sensitive to parameters that control the soil moisture stress. The findings demonstrate the challenges in accurately representing the effects of moisture stress on the stomatal sink of O3 during observed increases in dryness due to ecosystem-specific plant–resource interactions."
10.5194/acp-25-8637-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注黑碳气溶胶的微观物理特性，通过在德国一个背景站点的观测，研究了不同气团中黑碳的粒径、混合状态和挥发性。研究结果表明，夏季光化学过程和冬季居民供暖排放对黑碳的特性有显著影响。这些研究结果对于提高气溶胶光学模拟的准确性，进而提升空气质量监测和气候模型预测的准确性具有重要意义。虽然论文没有直接提及卫星观测或特定的遥感技术，但其对大气成分（特别是黑碳）的深入分析，与大气环境遥感技术在空气质量监测和大气成分分析中的应用密切相关。,"['black carbon aerosols', 'air quality monitoring', 'aerosol optical properties', 'atmospheric composition', 'radiative forcing', 'single-particle soot photometer', 'thermodenuder']",Yifan Yang;Thomas Müller;Laurent Poulain;Samira Atabakhsh;Bruna A. Holanda;Jens Voigtländer;Shubhi Arora;Mira L. Pöhlker,Microphysical properties of refractory black carbon aerosols for different air masses at a central European background site,"Black carbon (BC) is the major atmospheric aerosol that can absorb light and influence climate. We measured the physical properties of BC at a background site in Germany. In summer, BC particles were smaller and the mixture with other atmospheric components occurred during the daytime. In winter, emissions from residential heating significantly influenced BC's properties. Understanding these characteristics of BC can help to improve the accuracy of aerosol optic simulation. 
 Uncertainties persist in estimating the radiative forcing of black carbon (BC) due to an incomplete understanding of its microphysical properties. This study investigated the physical properties of refractory black carbon (rBC) at the central European background site Melpitz during summer and winter, using a single-particle soot photometer coupled with a thermodenuder. Different air masses associated with distinct rBC properties were identified in both seasons. In summer, rBC exhibited a similar mass concentration (∼0.16 µg m−3) among different air masses, with the smallest mass median diameter (MMD) of rBC observed in the long transportation from the northwest (140 nm), while in winter, the highest concentration (1.23 µg m−3) and largest MMD (216 nm) were both observed in the air mass influenced by the easterly winds. Thickly coated rBC fractions increased during the daytime in summer, indicating that the photochemical processes significantly influence the rBC mixing state. In winter, a higher fraction (27 %) of rBC, with thick coatings in the cold air mass compared to the warm air mass (14 %), suggests the contribution of residential heating emissions to the mixing state. Most rBC retained a low-volatility coating in the thermodenuder samples (63 % mass fraction). In summer, photochemical processes also contribute to coating volatility, showing a higher fraction of rBC particles containing low-volatility coatings during the daytime. In winter, low-volatility coatings showed no significant diurnal variation and were more dependent on ambient temperature. Therefore, rBC coating volatility in winter is more influenced by emission sources, particularly residential heating, rather than atmospheric processes."

Cooper;Laura Gallardo;Björn-Martin Sinnhuber;Florian Obersteiner;Andreas Zahn;Peter Hoor;Susanne Rohs;Andreas Marsing,Hemispheric differences in ozone across the stratosphere–troposphere exchange region,"We explored ozone differences between the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemispheres in the upper troposphere–lower stratosphere. We found lower ozone (with stratospheric origin) in the Southern Hemisphere, especially during years of severe ozone depletion. Sudden stratospheric warming events increased the ozone in each hemisphere, highlighting the relationship between stratospheric processes and ozone in the upper troposphere, where ozone is an important greenhouse gas. 
 Ozone changes in the upper troposphere–lower stratosphere (UTLS) resulting from dynamical and chemical processes strongly affect the atmosphere's radiative forcing. This study analyzed intra- and inter-hemispheric ozone differences in the UTLS within the 45–60° latitude band, distinguishing between years disrupted by sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events from 2002 to 2022. We utilized measurements from IAGOS commercial aircraft (45–60° N), long-term ozonesonde records (45–60° S) and unique in situ measurements from the high altitude and long range (HALO) research aircraft deployed over the southernmost region of South America (45–60° S) in September–November 2019 as a part of the Southern Hemisphere Transport, Dynamics, and Chemistry (SouthTRAC) research campaign. The mission period enabled us to examine the impact of two Southern Hemisphere (SH) SSW events that developed during 2002 and 2019. To enhance the spatial coverage, we incorporated Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service reanalysis data. Stratospheric air origin was assigned using relative humidity (<20 %) and carbon monoxide (<50 nmol mol−1) thresholds. Our results show that air masses of stratospheric origin had higher ozone abundances in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) UTLS than in the SH (between 300–200 hPa and 45–60° latitude): in high ozone depletion years in the stratospheric vortex, the SH ozone median (184 nmol mol−1) was only 54 % of that in the NH (341 nmol mol−1), while in low depletion years, SH ozone median (214 nmol mol−1) reached 57 % of the NH values (371 nmol mol−1). Notably, the SSW events (2002 and 2019) increased SH UTLS ozone by 24 % (43 nmol mol−1) compared to high depletion years, while in the NH, the increase was 9 % (31 nmol mol−1)."
10.5194/acp-25-8533-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注利用卫星遥感技术监测对流层臭氧，这是一种重要的空气污染物和温室气体。论文通过比较NASA的TROPESS项目（包括AIRS、CrIS和AIRS+OMI联合产品）的卫星数据与臭氧探空仪数据，量化了卫星产品在测量对流层臭氧时的偏差。研究发现，这些卫星产品在全球范围内具有较低的测量偏差，因此可以用于检测全球对流层臭氧的变化趋势。此外，论文还评估了区域趋势中的偏差，并强调了卫星数据在未来大气成分变化研究中的应用价值。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）密切相关。,"['tropospheric ozone', 'satellite products', 'ozonesondes', 'TROPESS', 'AIRS', 'CrIS', 'OMI', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'bias quantification', 'trend analysis']",Elyse A. Pennington;Gregory B. Osterman;Vivienne H. Payne;Kazuyuki Miyazaki;Kevin W. Bowman;Jessica L. Neu,"Quantifying biases in TROPESS AIRS, CrIS, and joint AIRS+OMI tropospheric ozone products using ozonesondes","Tropospheric ozone is a harmful pollutant and powerful greenhouse gas. For satellite products to accurately quantify trends in tropospheric ozone, they must have a low bias compared to a reliable source of data. This study compares three NASA satellite products to ozonesonde data. They have low global measurement bias and thus can be used to detect global tropospheric ozone trends, but the measurement bias should be considered in certain regions and time periods. 
 Quantifying changes in global and regional tropospheric ozone is critical for understanding global atmospheric chemistry and its impact on air quality and climate. Satellites now provide multi-decadal records of daily global ozone profiles, but previous studies have found large disagreements in satellite-based ozone trends, including in trends from different products based on the same spectral radiances. In light of these disagreements, it is critical to quantify to what degree the observed trend is attributable to measurement error for each product by comparing satellite-retrieved ozone to long-term measurements from ozonesondes. NASA's TRopospheric Ozone and its Precursors from Earth System Sounding (TROPESS) project provides satellite retrievals of ozone from a suite of instruments, including Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS), Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), and multispectral combinations such as AIRS and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) (joint AIRS+OMI) using a common algorithm. We compare these products to ozonesondes and find that the evolution of global tropospheric ozone satellite–sonde biases for TROPESS CrIS (0.21 ± 3.6 % decade−1, 2016–2021), AIRS (−0.41 ± 0.57 % decade−1, 2002–2022), and joint AIRS+OMI (1.1 ± 1.0 % decade−1, 2004–2022) are less than the magnitude of trends in global tropospheric ozone reported by the Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report Phase 1 (TOAR-I). We further quantify the bias in regional trends, which tend to be higher but with a smaller number of sondes, which can impact the satellite–sonde bias and trend. Our work represents an important basis for the utility of using satellite data to quantify changes in atmospheric composition in future studies."

The results show that the nature of substituents on the carbon chain can effectively affect the decomposition rate of organosulfates, and ozone is unveiled as a complementary oxidant in the intermediate steps of this decomposition. The primary products from these reactions include carbonyl compounds and inorganic sulfate, which highlights the role of organosulfates in altering aerosol chemical composition. 
 Organosulfates are important tracers for aerosol particles, yet their influence on aerosol chemical composition remains poorly understood. This study uses quantum chemical calculations based on density functional theory to explore the reactions of some prevalent organosulfates, specifically methyl sulfate and glycolic acid sulfate, with hydroxyl radicals (HO•) in the gas phase and aqueous phase. Results indicate that all reactions initiate with hydrogen abstraction by HO• from CH3- in methyl sulfate and from -CH2- and -COOH in glycolic acid sulfate, followed by the further reaction of the resulting radicals through self-decomposition, interaction with O2 and, possibly, O3. We found that the hydrogen abstraction from the -COOH group in glycolic acid sulfate could lead to decarboxylation and eventually form similar products as methyl sulfate. The primary reaction products are inorganic sulfate, carbonyl compounds, and formic sulfuric anhydride. Rate constants of 1.14×10-13  and 6.17×10-12 cm3 molec.−1 s−1 at 298.15 K were determined for the gas-phase reactions of methyl sulfate and glycolic acid sulfate, respectively. The former value is consistent with a previous experimental report. Additionally, besides O2 as the primary oxidant in the fragmentation of organosulfates, this study unveils that O3 may be a complementary oxidant in this process, especially in environments enriched with ozone. Overall, this study elucidates mechanisms for HO•-initiated transformation of organosulfates and highlights the potential role of chemical substitution, thereby enhancing our understanding of their atmospheric chemistry and implications for inorganic sulfate formation, which are vital for evaluating their impact on aerosol properties and climate processes."

Thornton,Remote sensing estimates of time-resolved HONO and NO2 emission rates and lifetimes in wildfires,"We present an analysis of high-resolution remote sensing measurements of nitrogen-containing trace gases emitted by wildfires. The measurements were made using an instrument on the NASA ER-2 aircraft in the summer of 2019. We find that time-resolved fire intensity is critical to quantify trace gas emissions over a fire's entire lifespan. These findings have implications for improving air pollution forecasts downwind of wildfires using computer models of atmospheric chemistry and meteorology. 
 Quantification of wildfire emissions is essential for comprehending and simulating the effects of wildfires on atmospheric chemical composition. Sub-orbital measurements of vertical column nitrous acid (HONO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were made during the Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality (FIREX-AQ) field campaign using the GeoCAPE Airborne Simulator (GCAS) instrument on board the NASA ER-2 aircraft. The emission rates and lifetimes of HONO and NO2 from the Sheridan Fire were estimated by fitting exponentially modified Gaussians (EMGs) to line densities, a technique previously used to estimate urban and point source NO2 emissions. As the EMG approach does not capture temporal changes in emissions and lifetimes due to time-varying fire behavior, we developed a Monte Carlo implementation of the Python Editable Chemical Atmospheric Numeric Solver (PECANS) model that includes diurnal fire radiative power (FRP) behavior. We assessed the validity of a range of emission rate and lifetime combinations for both HONO and NO2 as the fire evolves by comparing the resulting line density predictions to the line density observations. We found that our method results in emissions that are lower than top-down biomass burning emissions inventories and higher than bottom-up inventories. Our approach is applicable to interpreting time-resolved remotely sensed measurements of atmospheric trace gases such as those now becoming available with instruments on board geostationary satellites such as the Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) and the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) instruments."

Simulations show its data processing can retrieve fluorescence with high accuracy. These results suggest TanSat-2 will enhance global tracking of the carbon cycle and vegetation health, providing valuable insights for climate change research. 
 Global observations of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) serve as a robust proxy for monitoring vegetation photosynthetic activity and elucidating the terrestrial carbon cycle. To date, several atmospheric remote sensing satellites have been deployed to generate global SIF products. However, accurate mapping of dual-band (red and far-red) SIF with daily temporal resolution and kilometer-level spatial resolution remains a critical gap, despite its significance for various applications. The Chinese next-generation greenhouse gas monitoring satellite, TanSat-2, is set to succeed the original TanSat satellite, aiming to record the fraction of greenhouse gases, pollutants, and SIF measurements from space. According to current schedules, TanSat-2 is slated for launch in 2026. This satellite will feature a wide swath of 2900 km, a high spatial resolution of 2 km at an orbit altitude of 7000 km, and near-daily global coverage. TanSat-2 is equipped with two spectral channels, 747–777 and 672–702 nm, operating at a spectral resolution of 0.12 nm, thereby offering significant potential for mapping SIF in both the red and the far-red bands. In this study, we explore the prospective capabilities of TanSat-2 for SIF retrieval through simulation experiments. First, we simulated the satellite's radiative transfer processes using the Moderate Resolution Atmospheric Transmission 5 (MODTRAN 5) and Soil Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy (SCOPE) models. An end-to-end orbit simulation dataset for TanSat-2 was generated by aggregating global bottom-of-atmosphere (BOA) reflectance, meteorological datasets, and the global Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) SIF dataset (GOSIF). We then assessed the theoretical accuracy of TanSat-2 based on this spectral simulation dataset, yielding root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.24 and 0.19 mW m−2 sr−1 nm−1 for SIF retrievals at 740 and 685 nm, respectively. Finally, we examined the global prospects of TanSat-2 SIF retrievals using the end-to-end orbit simulations. Comparisons between the anticipated TanSat-2 SIF retrievals and GOSIF inputs revealed excellent correlation at both bands, with R2 values of 0.88 and 0.61 and RMSE values of 0.082 and 0.061 mW m−2 sr−1 nm−1, respectively. Thus, TanSat-2 is poised to provide a valuable data resource for reliable SIF retrievals in the red and far-red bands, characterized by high spatiotemporal resolution on a global scale."

MOMA improved the accuracy of PurpleAir sensor data comparable to the EPA correction. Although reliant on nearby reference sites, MOMA offers valuable insights into potential PM sources, thereby increasing the overall value of PurpleAir sensor networks. 
 Air sensors are being used more frequently to measure hyper-local air quality. The PurpleAir sensor is among one of the most popular air sensors used worldwide to measure fine particulate matter (PM2.5). However, there is a need to understand PurpleAir data quality especially under different environmental conditions with varying particulate matter (PM) sources and size distributions. Several correction factors have been developed to make the PurpleAir sensor data more comparable to reference monitor data. The goal of this work was to determine the performance of a remote calibration tool called MOment MAtching (MOMA) for PM2.5 sensors monitoring near temporally varying pollution sources of PM2.5. MOMA performs calibrations using reference site data within 0–15 km from the sensor. Data are from 20 PurpleAir sensors deployed across a network in Phoenix, Arizona, from July 2019 to April 2021. Results showed that the MOMA calibration tool made the PurpleAir PM2.5 data more comparable to the co-located reference data (calibrated mean absolute error (MAE): 2.8–3.7 µg m−3; mean   bias error (MBE): −1.8–0.1 µg m−3). The improvements were comparable to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) correction factor (MAE: 2.8–3.7 µg m−3; MBE: −0.9–0.4 µg m−3). However, MOMA provided a better estimate of daily average concentrations than the EPA correction factor when compared to the reference data under smoke conditions. Using the MOMA gain, representative of the sensor–proxy relationship, MOMA was able to distinguish between PM sources such as winter wood burning, wildfires, and dust events in the summer."

Remote sensing instruments, including two ceilometers (models CL31 and CL61, Vaisala Oyj), a Doppler cloud radar (model RPG-FMCW-94, RPG Radiometer Physics GmbH), and a Doppler wind lidar (model StreamLine XR, HALO Photonics), were deployed at Kenttärova, Finland, a measurement station that is part of the Pallas Atmosphere–Ecosystem Supersite. The instruments operated continuously throughout the entire campaign, with the exception of a few technical interruptions and brief maintenance periods. The PaCE 2022 remote sensing measurements provided vertical profiles of atmospheric targets with high temporal and vertical resolution, extending from the ground up to an altitude of 10–15 km, depending on the instrument. By combining the data from these instruments and a numerical weather prediction model, cloud microphysical and macrophysical properties – such as ice water content, ice effective radius, and target classification – were retrieved using the Cloudnet methodology. The processed remote sensing data set complements the PaCE in situ measurements, providing valuable validation opportunities.

Our findings show Africa's cropland grew by 8.5 % over 2 decades, while 11.5 % of cropland was abandoned by 2018, revealing hidden challenges in agricultural sustainability. These yearly field-sized maps help governments track where farming grows or shrinks, plan food supplies, and protect vital cropland. 
 Accurate cropland mapping is essential for understanding agricultural dynamics in Africa and critical for achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as Zero Hunger. Large-scale cropland mapping encounters several challenges, including the varying landscape characteristics of cropland across different regions, extended cultivation periods, and limited availability of reference data. This study develops a 30 m resolution African annual cropland distribution (namely AFCD) dataset spanning the years 2000 to 2022. To extract this large-scale cropland distribution data, we employed random forest (RF) classification and continuous change-detection (CCD) algorithms on the Google Earth Engine platform. Robust training samples were generated, and a locally adaptive model was applied for cropland extraction. The final output consists of annual binary crop/non-crop maps from 2000 to 2022. Independent validation samples from numerous third-party sources confirm that the map's accuracy is 0.86 ± 0.01. A comparison of the cropland area estimates from AFCD with those of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) for Africa yielded an R2 value of 0.86. According to our estimates, Africa's cropland expanded from 1.9435×108 ha in 2000 to 2.1092×108 ha in 2022, marking a net increase of 8.53 %. Prior to 2005, changes in Africa's cropland area were gradual, but after 2006, there has been a marked acceleration in cropland expansion. Despite this continued growth, Africa also experienced significant cropland abandonment. By 2018, abandoned cropland accounted for 11.52 % of the total active cropland area. AFCD also avoided the misclassification of buildings, roads, and trees surrounding cropland common in existing products. The study further highlights the unique advantage of AFCD in providing a dynamic annual cropland dataset at 30 m resolution for Africa. This dataset is a crucial resource for understanding the spatial–temporal dynamics of cropland and can support policies on food security and sustainable land management.

To understand these changes, models are needed. MetROMS-UHel is a new version of an ocean–sea ice model with updated sea ice code and the atmospheric data. We investigate the effect of our updates on different variables with a focus on sea ice and show an improved sea ice representation as compared with observations. 
 In recent years, the Antarctic sea ice has experienced major changes, which are neither well understood nor adequately reproduced by Earth system models. To support model development with an aim to improve Antarctic sea ice and upper-ocean predictions, the impacts of updating the sea ice model and the atmospheric forcing are investigated. In the new MetROMS-UHel-v1.0 (henceforth MetROMS-UHel) ocean–sea ice model, the sea ice component has been updated from CICE5 to CICE6, and the forcing has been updated from ERA-Interim (ERAI) to ERA5 reanalyses. The two versions of MetROMS evaluated in this study use a version of the regional ROMS ocean model including ice shelf cavities. We find that the update of CICE (Community Ice CodE) and ERA reduced the negative bias of the sea ice area in summer. However, the sea ice volume decreases after the CICE update but increases when the atmospheric forcing is updated. As a net result after both updates, the modelled sea ice becomes thinner and more deformed, particularly near the coast. The ROMS ocean model usually yielded a deeper ocean mixed layer compared to observations. Using ERA5, the situation was slightly improved. The update from CICE5 to CICE6 resulted in a fresher coastal ocean due to a smaller salt flux from sea ice to the ocean. In the ice shelf cavities, the modelled melt rates are generally underestimated compared with observations, with the largest underestimation coming from the ice shelves in the too cold Amundsen and Bellingshausen seas as well as from the Australian sector in East Antarctica. These identified sea ice and oceanic changes vary seasonally and regionally. By determining sea ice and oceanic changes after the model and forcing updates and evaluating them against observations, this study informs modellers on improvements and aspects requiring attention with potential model adjustments."

While Geobacter sulfurreducens has been identified as a promising diazotroph, its BNF efficiency remains untapped. Here, we engineered G. sulfurreducens by deleting the ammonium transporter gene amtB (strain ΔamtB), achieving a record-high BNF rate of 20.57 ± 0.87 mg N L–1 day–1, approximately twice that of the wild-type strain and exceeding those of all reported free-living diazotrophs and synthetic catalysts for ambient nitrogen fixation. 15N isotope labeling and nitrogenase activity assays confirmed enhanced fixation, whereas biofertilizer trials demonstrated the ability of ΔamtB as a biofertilizer to support Arabidopsis thaliana growth. Mechanistic studies revealed that amtB deletion (1) amplified cellular nitrogen assimilation, (2) alleviated ammonium-mediated suppression of nitrogenase activity, and (3) disrupted energy-intensive futile ammonium cycling, conserving cell energy.

However, most of these assays target nuclear receptors, with a very limited number targeting membrane proteins (e.g., receptors, transporters, and ion channels). Membrane proteins are an important protein group. They outnumber nuclear receptors by 2 orders of magnitude, play important roles in many physiological processes, and are highly conserved across species. Chemicals targeting membrane proteins might trigger more severe adverse effects. Despite their significance, the adverse effects of chemicals on membrane proteins have largely been overlooked. To promote the assessment of human and ecological health effects of chemicals, this perspective summarizes the categories and functions of important membrane proteins, adverse effects of chemicals on humans and wildlife by targeting membrane proteins, and the available membrane protein-targeting in vitro bioassays in toxicity testing.

In this study, we investigate BrC evolution by synthesizing data from one laboratory campaign and four aircraft campaigns spanning diverse spatial scales across North America. To estimate initial conditions for evaluating plume evolution, we develop a method to parametrize the emission ratios of BrC and other species using commonly measured inert tracers, acetonitrile and hydrogen cyanide. The evolution of BrC absorption in the free troposphere is characterized as a function of hydroxyl radical (OH) exposure, yielding an effective photochemical rate constant of 9.7–1.6+4.8 × 10–12 cm3 molecule–1 s–1. The relatively slow reaction rate results in small BrC decay within the first few hours after emission, making it difficult to distinguish from source variability. This helps explain the absence of clear evolutionary trends in near-field studies. Assuming an OH concentration of 1.26 × 106 molecules cm–3, this rate constant corresponds to an e-folding lifetime of approximately 23 h. After extensive photooxidation (OH exposure ∼1012 molecules cm–3 s), 4 ± 2% of the emitted BrC persists, representing a recalcitrant fraction with potential long-term climate impacts. These results improve our understanding of BrC variability and photochemical processing and provide critical constraints for modeling its impacts on climate."

The operating conditions for the bioreactor and the ecological interactions among functional populations are crucial in controlling this process, but they have not been completely ascertained. Here, we studied two operating conditions (i.e., environmental factors): (1) the substrate ratio of ethanol and lactate as coelectron donors, and (2) the temperature, which affected both the product specificity (i.e., function) and microbial dynamics of chain-elongating microbiomes in a continuously fed bioreactor with product extraction that is the third pertinent operating condition. Specifically, we found that the increase in the substrate ratio of ethanol to lactate shifted the microbiomes toward n-caprylate (C8) production, while the slightly higher operating temperatures of 37 or 42 °C were advantageous to n-caproate (C6) production. We detected a core microbiome that was similar for all operating conditions and the two bioreactors, consisting of populations from Sphaerochaeta spp., Caproiciproducens spp., and Oscillospiraceae. Besides the core microbiome, we observed positive correlations between Erysipelaclostridiaceae UCG-004, Bacteroides spp., Oscillospiraceae NK4A214, Rikenellaceae RC9, and Pseudoclavibacter spp. with n-caprylate production in a dormant microbiome. Similar populations compared to the core microbiome were positively correlated with n-caproate production for both bioreactors, because n-caproate must first be produced before conversion into n-caprylate. The results showed that we can steer microbiomes toward a high specificity of certain medium-chain carboxylates."

This study combines carbon (δ13C), nitrogen (δ15N), sulfur (δ34S), and mercury (Δ199Hg/δ202Hg) isotopes to investigate trophic niches of coastal and oceanic elasmobranchs across two ecosystems in northwestern Mexico. In the Pacific Ocean, similar δ13C, δ15N, Δ199Hg, and δ202Hg values suggest that elasmobranchs relied on common pelagic resources, likely from upwelling events. In the Gulf of California, coastal species with higher δ13C and δ15N values and lower Δ199Hg and δ202Hg values fed on prey isotopically distinct from those offshore, allowing classification trees to identify foraging habitats more accurately than in the Pacific.

Using zebrafish as a model organism, this study evaluated the neurodevelopmental toxicity of prednisone, dexamethasone, acetaminophen, amoxicillin, and azithromycin. The results demonstrated that these pharmaceuticals significantly inhibited embryo hatching, increased mortality, and induced abnormal neurobehavior during the critical developmental window of 36–72 h postfertilization. These effects were accompanied by reduced neuronal cholesterol levels, downregulated neurodevelopmental gene expression, and disrupted cholesterol metabolism. Mechanistic studies revealed that the downregulation of the cholesterol efflux transporter abcg1 is a key factor in pharmaceuticals-induced neurotoxicity. Suppression of abcg1 caused cholesterol accumulation in astrocytes and a deficiency in neurons, resulting in impaired neuronal function and structure. Conversely, overexpression of abcg1 alleviated these toxic effects.

This study employed ratiometric fluorescence sensing for nondestructive, real-time pH mapping in current-producing EABs. The distribution of protons in EABs is determined by both their generation, which is electron donor-dependent, and their transfer, mediated by concentration gradients and buffering effects. Real-time pH mapping evidenced that under low organic conditions (≤0.4 g/L NaAc) in a PBS-free system, proton diffusion driven solely by concentration gradients prevented internal acidification (pH ≥ 6). However, elevated organics (0.8 g/L NaAc) triggered excessive proton accumulation exceeding transfer capacity, resulting in pronounced acidification (pH < 6) and subsequent electroactivity suppression. It also showed that while employing PBS maintained a neutral pH (∼7) for sustained current generation, it concurrently diminished the intrinsic proton concentration gradient, impairing proton diffusion efficiency. Finally, the electron flux was further derived in two ways: converted from the stoichiometric relationship with proton flux (Je, cal) and calculated from the measured current (Je, test) by applying proton flux, and a better linear fitting correlation was achieved when there was no PBS.

This study investigates the molecular-scale interactions of five representative DOM types with goethite, focusing on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation under simulated sunlight (UVA, 5.7 mW/cm2). Among the ROS species, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) exhibited the most pronounced variation in yield across the different DOM types. DOM analysis revealed that natural DOM (humic acid [HA] and fulvic acid [FA]) contains hydroxyl/phenolic groups and sulfur–nitrogen heteroatoms, whereas MP-DOM (polystyrene [PS-DOM], polybutylene adipate terephthalate [PBAT-DOM], and polyethylene [PE-DOM]) is rich in aromatic and aliphatic structures. PS-DOM and PBAT-DOM induced significant lattice distortion and Fe(III) reduction, promoting oxygen vacancy formation, while PE-DOM exhibited minimal reactivity due to its hydrophobic structure. Optical and electrochemical characterizations showed that DOM lowered the conduction band position and narrowed the band gap of goethite, enhancing light absorption and charge separation. PS-DOM and HA induced the highest photocurrents and H2O2 yields, with PS-DOM enhancing H2O2 production via oxygen vacancy formation. Multivariate analysis identified condensed aromatics and sulfur–nitrogen groups as key regulators of ROS generation by promoting electron transfer and defect formation.

The estimated loadings of PFOA and PFOS from air-to-water were 9.5 ± 3.6 and 17 ± 6.6 kg/y, respectively, close to the values from wet deposition (10 ± 3.9 and 31 ± 12 kg/y, respectively) but much lower than those from inflow and all other sources. The primary output pathways for PFOA and PFOS were from water outflow."

Due to complications in DCC dynamics and microphysics, and aerosol size distribution and composition, understanding aerosol‐DCC interactions has been a daunting challenge. Recently, the convective invigoration mechanisms through enhancing latent heating in condensation and ice‐related processes that have been proposed in literature are debated for their significance qualitatively and quantitatively. A salient issue arising from these debates is the imperative need to clarify essential knowledge and methodologies in investigating aerosol impacts on deep convection. Here we have presented our view of key aspects on investigating and understanding these invigoration mechanisms as well as the aerosol and meteorological conditions under which these mechanisms may be significant based on new findings. For example, the condensational invigoration is most significant under a clean condition with an introduction of a large number of ultrafine particles, and the freezing‐induced invigoration can be significant in a clean condition with a large number of relatively large‐size particles being added. We have made practical recommendations on approaches for investigating aerosol impacts on convection with both modeling and observations. We note that the feedback induced by the invigoration via the enhanced latent heating to circulation and meteorology can be an important part of aerosol impacts but is very complicated and varies with different convective storm types. This is an important future direction for studying aerosol‐DCC interactions."

We estimate the emission rates for carbon dioxide (CO2), CH4, and NOx from the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field during the spring of 2022 using airborne mass balance methods and emission ratios. We also discuss emissions per energy produced and show an increase over time, with values higher than the national average for oil and gas producing regions, though within uncertainties. Our estimates are lower than the NOx emission estimate reported in the National Emissions Inventory (NEI), as seen in other oil and gas studies, but fall within the uncertainty range of the greenhouse gases reported in the GHGRP.

Climatic Effect of Dust,"Geological records indicate that Earth may have experienced at least two global‐scale glaciations during the Cryogenian Period (720–630 million years ago), known as snowball Earth events. This study quantifies the radiative forcing of continental dust and evaluates its capacity to reduce the critical CO2 concentration required for snowball Earth deglaciation. We find that atmospheric dust induces a relatively modest global‐mean radiative forcing of about 0.4–1.5 W m−2 at the top of the atmosphere. The surface‐deposited dust lowers global‐mean surface albedo by about 0.06, corresponding to a larger radiative forcing, ∼10 W m−2. In local regions, the reduction of surface albedo can reach 0.2–0.3 and its corresponding radiative forcing is ∼30–50 W m−2. When the continental ice sheet is not considered, the CO2 threshold without dust is ∼4–7 times that with dust. As the ice sheet is included, the CO2 threshold without dust is ∼1.5–2.0 times that with dust, indicating a moderate role of continental dust. It is worth noting that this work does not consider the process that dust deposited over sea ice would be transported to deep tropical net‐sublimation regions by sea glacier dynamics, which would further decrease the CO2 threshold (Abbot and Pierrehumbert, Mudball: Surface dust and Snowball Earth deglaciation, JGR‐Atmos, 2010, 115, D03104) and should be explored in the future."

Using an atmospheric general circulation model with an interactive dust module and an ice sheet model, we explicitly simulate continental dust emission on a hard snowball Earth. We find that the strength of continental dust emissions is within 494–3,051 Tg yr−1, which is comparable to or even less than the modern Earth (2,566 ± $\mathit{\pm }$ 1,966 Tg yr−1) and is about one order less than previous estimations.

However, debates are intensifying over the pace and direction of energy transitions needed to meet these goals. Our study highlights significant uncertainties in the terrestrial carbon cycle and their implications for mitigation efforts and energy transition pathways. We used the results from the TRENDY Model‐Intercomparison Project to represent terrestrial carbon cycle simulations from 11 models using the Hector model, the simple climate model coupled to a multisector integrated assessment model, the Global Change Analysis Model. Focusing on scenarios limiting global warming to 1.5°C by the end of the century, we assessed the uncertainties in energy trajectories and associated carbon prices. Our results reveal that uncertainties in terrestrial carbon cycle projections meaningfully affect the pace of global energy transitions to meet climate policy goals. The models predict the phase‐out of unabated coal power generation by 2050 ± 7 years. Additionally, ensemble simulations estimate a carbon price of 170.25 ± 38.84 $/tCO2e in 2010$ by the end of the century. Our findings highlight the critical need to refine models and integrate updated data to improve the reliability of carbon cycle projections and guide effective climate policy development. Specifically, enhancing the representation of the terrestrial carbon cycle in integrated assessment models is essential. Addressing these uncertainties is crucial for informed decision‐making and effective implementation of strategies to achieve long‐term climate objectives."

García‐Herrera,AI‐Driven Weather Forecasts to Accelerate Climate Change Attribution of Heatwaves,"Anthropogenic climate change (ACC) is driving an increase in the frequency, intensity, and duration of heatwaves (HWs), making the rapid attribution of these events essential for assessing climate‐related risks. Traditional attribution methods often suffer from selection bias, high computational costs, and delayed results, limiting their utility for real‐time decision‐making. In this study, we introduce a novel artificial intelligence (AI)‐driven attribution framework that integrates physics‐based ACC estimates from global climate models with state‐of‐the‐art AI weather prediction (AIWP) models. We apply this approach to four HWs across different climatic regions using two AIWP models (FourCastNet‐v2 and Pangu‐Weather) and one hybrid AI‐physics model (NeuralGCM). Our results show that AIWP models accurately predict HW intensity and spatial patterns, capturing key synoptic features such as persistent high‐pressure ridges. The attribution analysis reveals a robust ACC signal in all four events and a good agreement across models. Results from the hybrid model (NeuralGCM) suggest that the intensification of HWs due to ACC can largely be inferred from the atmospheric state a few days prior to the event, while sea surface temperature forcing becomes increasingly relevant at longer lead times and in specific regions. This study demonstrates that AI‐based attribution enables near real‐time and anticipatory assessment of HWs, offering a scalable and computationally efficient alternative to conventional methods. By providing timely and consistent attribution of extreme heat events, this approach enhances our ability to anticipate climate risks and inform adaptation strategies in a rapidly warming world."

Comprehensive yet comprehensible targeted climate risk information exploring these uncertainties is essential for the strategic allocation of limited resources to vulnerable areas and sectors in the region. Yet conventional approaches struggle to provide it. This study addresses this gap by introducing an interdisciplinary framework incorporating meteorological, hydrological, and socio‐economic perspectives. A “plausibilistic” flood risk assessment approach is presented which combines both climate and socio‐economic storylines. Plausible climate scenario storylines are sampled based on their relevance for local impacts, allowing the assessment of conditional changes in high‐impact probabilistic discharges. Plausible socio‐economic storylines are integrated to asses future urban area and economic sectoral development. This information allows the projection of the impact potential in the region and its cascading socio‐economic effects. An example application to the flood‐prone, transboundary Lielupe basin shared by Latvia and Lithuania highlights sub‐catchments and sectors consistently vulnerable across diverse, relevant, and credible set of future storylines. The framework thus equips regional risk managers with targeted and robust risk information, providing a strong knowledge base for prioritizing adaptation planning."

However, their effects on the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a critical mode of climate variability, are poorly understood. Here we use ensembles of climate model simulations to show that deploying MCB in the subtropical eastern Pacific dramatically reduces ENSO amplitude by approximately 61%, while SAI has a negligible impact. MCB increases cloud albedo, which cools the subtropical eastern Pacific and triggers a loss of moist static energy. This cooling promotes atmospheric subsidence, dries the tropical Pacific, and intensifies the trade winds. The ultimate effect is a dramatic reduction in all air‐sea feedback processes operating during ENSO, which we demonstrate using a mixed‐layer heat budget. This contrast between the MCB and SAI impacts on ENSO shows that the choice of climate intervention strategy used to mitigate global warming has drastic regional implications."

In addition to affecting communities, anthropogenic pollution is delivered to the Lake's playa sediments, which are eroded during dust events. Yet, spatial variability in dust flux and composition and their risks to human health are poorly understood. We analyzed dust in 17 passive samplers proximal to the Lake during fall 2022 for dust flux, the dust fraction of particulate matter, 87Sr/86Sr, and elemental geochemistry. We evaluated spatial patterns of 11 priority pollutant metals and estimated the hypothetical non‐cancer dust and soil ingestion health hazard for six age cohorts. We observed the highest dust fluxes proximal to the Lake's playa. The highest concentrations of and greatest number of metals occurred in and south of Ogden, UT. Sites to the northeast of Farmington Bay had the highest fluxes. Metal concentrations and 87Sr/86Sr suggest that the dust composition near Bountiful represents contributions from anthropogenic sources, whereas the dust composition to the northeast of Farmington Bay reflects the Lake's playa emissions. Evaluations of potential health hazards from dust ingestion suggest that children between birth and 6 years are vulnerable at higher ingestion rates. Thallium, As, Pb, Co and Cr contributed most to the estimated hazard. Among these, As and sometimes Pb are likely derived from the Lake's playa emissions. Thus, suppression of dust emissions from the Lake's playa may decrease possible health risks for children in northern Utah."

The incidence of SFTS exhibits evident seasonality, commencing from March and gradually escalating from April, peaking between May and June, followed by a decline with reduced incidence after October. To investigate the short‐term correlation between meteorological factors and SFTS incidence, generalized additive models (GAM) and distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNM) were employed for evaluation. The results indicated that specific temperature ranges (18–23°C), certain atmospheric pressure ranges (1,006–1,017 hPa), extremely high wind speeds (>11.6 m/s), and prolonged sunshine durations (>9h) increase the short‐term risk of SFTS.






Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a tick‐borne zoonotic disease, which are classified by the World Health Organization as a priority disease for research and development in emergency situations due to the high mortality rate. Previous studies indicated that the complex nonlinear and delayed association was observed between meteorological factors and SFTS. However, these did not consider the short‐term effect of meteorological factors on the incidence of SFTS. In this study, we used generalized additive models (GAM) and distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNM) to investigate the short‐term correlation between meteorological factors and SFTS incidence. From 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2023 a total of 6,601 cases of SFTS were reported in Xinyang. Females constituted the majority with a male‐to‐female ratio of 0.68 and the average age of cases being approximately at around 61.52 years old. The multivariate GAM analysis revealed that mean temperature exerted the greatest influence on the incidence of SFTS compared to other meteorological factors and interacted with these factors. After accounting for lag period of 0–14 days, the DLNM analysis indicated that specific range of temperature (18–23°C), a certain range atmospheric pressure (1,006–1,017 hPa), extreme high wind speed (>11.6 m/s), and prolonged sunshine duration (>9h) were associated with SFTS, while there was no significant correlation between relative humidity and the incidence of SFTS. This study investigates the non‐linear trend and lagged exposure effect of various meteorological factors on short‐term SFTS incidence, thereby enhancing our comprehensive understanding of the effect of meteorological factors on SFTS."

 Glacial erosion must be quantified to better constrain numerous geomorphic and orogenic processes; however, accurate models of glacial erosion have been limited by sparse data. Here we use machine learning tools to develop equations that integrate glacial erosion and glaciological, topoclimatic and geological variables based on a global-scale synthesis of 181 contemporary glacier-derived erosion rates. The results reveal environment-specific erosion rate equations for surge-type, marine- and land-terminating glacial settings. We demonstrate that glacial velocity is not the most statistically important predictor of glacial erosion in any environment. Instead, an improved prediction of glacial erosion is attained when velocity is considered with additional glaciological, topoclimatic and geological variables, with the most dominant influences exhibited by precipitation, glacial elevation, length, latitude and the underlying geology. Using these equations, we estimate erosion rates for 85% of contemporary glaciers, with 99% eroding between 0.02 and 2.68 mm yr−1. Our results suggest a need to adjust how we predict or hindcast glacial erosion rates and highlight their sensitivity not only to changes in glacial sliding velocity but also to additional glaciological, topoclimatic and geological influences.

 Coastal wetlands are important land–ocean interfaces for organic carbon storage. It was assumed that reactive poorly crystalline or short-range-ordered iron minerals enhance organic carbon accrual and persistence. However, these metastable minerals are prone to rapid reductive dissolution, raising uncertainties about their abundance and impact on carbon cycling in coastal wetlands, where anoxia typically prevails. Here we combine a global database of ~23,000 observations and a national survey across China’s coastline. We show that coastal wetlands are enriched preferentially in poorly crystalline or short-range-ordered iron minerals over well-crystalline phases, compared with uplands. Mössbauer spectroscopy reveals that ferrihydrite, nanogoethite and highly disordered phases dominated the iron oxide pool in coastal wetlands, with minor crystalline forms, challenging the notion that reactive metastable minerals are removed preferentially under anoxic conditions. We find that reactive metastable iron was most abundant in tropical wetlands, in contrast with tropical uplands where crystalline minerals predominate. Despite a higher abundance of metastable iron minerals, coastal wetlands had a similar fraction of total organic carbon associated with iron oxides (~13%) to uplands. Furthermore, these widespread metastable iron minerals show no evidence of organic carbon saturation in coastal wetlands, highlighting potential for boosting this rusty carbon sink through management practices.

Zhang,Earth’s silicate weathering continuum,"Chemical weathering of silicate rocks occurs along a continuum from terrestrial to marine environments. 
 Chemical weathering of silicate rocks redistributes major, minor and trace elements through coupled dissolution–precipitation reactions. These weathering processes drive shifts in ocean acid–base chemistry, modulating atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and providing a stabilizing feedback in the carbon cycle. Silicate weathering occurs in both terrestrial and marine environments, releasing (‘forward’) or consuming alkalinity (‘reverse’), but these have largely been perceived as independent and studied in isolation. However, weathering products are transported downstream across terrestrial and to marine environments, suggesting a dynamic coupling of these weathering processes across scales. Here we propose that the Earth’s silicate weathering occurs along a continuum linking mountains to the deepest sedimentary environments and forward to reverse weathering. In this framework, the magnitude and direction of a local weathering flux depends on the materials’ origin, weathering–erosion history and environmental conditions. Consequently, global silicate weathering fluxes and the long-term carbon cycle feedback may be governed by the dynamic interplay of various environments along the silicate weathering continuum.

Here we develop in situ monitoring and ex situ manipulation experiments, combined with biogeochemical, metagenomic and culture-based experiments, to show that methane is rapidly produced by archaea in frequently oxygenated sandy sediments. We show that methane emissions from sandy sediments are not inhibited by repeated oxygen exposure and suggest the activity is driven by aerotolerant methylotrophic methanogens (primarily Methanosarcinaceae) broadly distributed in the surface layers of sandy sediments.

 Intensive care unit (ICU) patients often experience rapid changes in clinical status, requiring timely identification of deterioration to guide life-sustaining interventions. Current artificial intelligence (AI) models for acuity assessment rely on mortality as a proxy and lack direct prediction of clinical instability or treatment needs. Here we present APRICOT-M, a state-space model to predict real-time ICU acuity outcomes and transitions, and the need for life-sustaining therapies within the next four hours.

Our model is trained on over 140,000 ICU admissions across 55 hospitals and validated on external and real-time data, outperforming clinical scores in predicting mortality and instability. The model demonstrates clinical relevance, with physicians reporting alerts as actionable and timely in a substantial portion of cases.

Here, authors use in situ X-ray computed tomography and fluid dynamics simulations to reveal how synthetic clay coating suppresses chaotic ion flow, enabling uniform zinc growth and stable cycling in a large-scale pouch cell. 
 Metal anodes hold considerable promise for high-energy-density batteries but are fundamentally limited by electrochemical irreversibility caused by uneven metal deposition and dendrite formation, which compromise battery lifespan and safety. The chaotic ion flow (or ion flux vortex) near the electrode surface, driving these instabilities, has remained elusive due to limitations in conventional techniques such as scanning electron and atomic force microscopies, which are invasive and incapable of probing internal structures of deposits. Here, we employ in-situ X-ray computed tomography (CT) to non-destructively visualize Zn deposition on LAPONITE-coated Zn anodes, thereby revealing the internal structural evolution and deposition orientation. Combined with computational fluid dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the LAPONITE coating, with its separated positive and negative charge centers, suppresses ionic vortex formation, guiding uniform, dense, and vertically aligned Zn growth along (100) plane, thereby significantly mitigating dendrite growth. This translates into a 3.17-Ah Zn-MnO2 pouch cell with stable performance over 100 cycles, offering a viable path toward scalable, high-performance metal-anode batteries.

 Chromatin signatures are widely used to identify tissue-specific in vivo enhancers, but their sensitivity and specificity remains unclear. Here we show that many developmental enhancers remain undetectable using currently available chromatin data. In an initial comparison of over 1200 developmental enhancers with tissue-matched chromatin data, 14% (n = 285) lacked canonical enhancer-associated chromatin signatures. To further assess the prevalence of enhancers missed by chromatin profiling approaches, we used a high-throughput transgenic enhancer assay to screen the regulatory landscapes of two key developmental genes at 5 kb resolution, spanning 1.3 Mb of mouse sequence in total. We observed that 23 of 88 (26%) in vivo enhancers discovered by this approach lacked enhancer-associated chromatin signatures in the respective tissue. Our findings suggest the existence of tens of thousands of enhancers that remain undiscovered by currently available chromatin data, underscoring the continued need for expanding resources for enhancer discovery.

Here, the authors analyze the transcriptome of infected cells and show that HCMV turns on dormant neuronal genes through chromatin manipulation to achieve this goal. 
 Viral invasion of the host cell causes some of the most dramatic changes in biology. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) extensively remodels host cells, altering nuclear shape and generating a cytoplasmic viral-induced assembly compartment (vIAC). How these striking morphology changes occur in the context of host gene regulation is still emerging. Histone variant macroH2A1 is both important for maintaining nuclear integrity and functions to promote herpes simplex virus infection. Therefore, we hypothesized it may also function in cytomegalovirus infection. Here, we discovered that macroH2A1 is necessary for HCMV-induced cellular reorganization and formation of infectious progeny. Using RNA-seq in infected cells, we find that while all viral genes are highly expressed in the absence of macroH2A1, many HCMV-induced host genes are not. Remarkably, hundreds of these HCMV-induced macroH2A1-dependent host genes are associated with a neuronal signature. Further, we find that HCMV immediate early protein, IE1, is both necessary and sufficient to induce these neuronal genes, providing a mechanism of activation. Together, our findings demonstrate that HCMV hijacks a dormant neuronal secretory pathway through chromatin manipulation for efficient virion maturation. HCMV rearranges the host cell to produce infectious virus but molecular details are still unclear.

 Nonlinear effects in chemical reactions, coupled with amplifying catalysis, can lead to remarkable phenomena like spontaneous symmetry breaking, central to the origin of biological homochirality. Soai’s asymmetric autocatalysis is a prototypical reaction for this, where the enantiomeric excess of the product alcohol is amplified during alkylation of pyridyl and pyrimidyl carbaldehydes by diisopropylzinc. However, the complex equilibria and elusive intermediates make the mechanism difficult to clarify. Here we unravel the intricate dynamics of this reaction by in situ high-resolution mass spectrometry, kinetic analysis, and reaction profile simulations. We identify for both the pyrimidyl and the pyridyl systems transient hemiacetalate isopropyl zinc complexes, formed by the addition of the alcoholate product to the aldehyde, as key catalytic intermediates. These diastereomeric complexes enable dual stereocontrol, explaining the observed enantioselectivity. Our analysis confirms the structures of all intermediates and validates the autocatalytic cycle, offering insights into how substituent and structural variations influence reaction performance. This understanding guides the design of new, efficient asymmetric autocatalytic systems.

 Developing highly active and robust catalysts remains a critical challenge for the industrial realization and implementation of nitrate reduction. Here, we proposed a screw dislocation-mediated three-dimensional (3D) printing strategy for scalable, integrated manufacturing of metamaterial catalysts. Specifically, screw dislocation was introduced into the 3D printing process to mediate the simultaneous synthesis of 3D architecture and chiral surface nanostructures, effectively eliminating conventional heterointerfaces. Additionally, severe strain effects induced by dislocation multiplication in curved spaces enhance intrinsic catalytic activity by promoting NO3− adsorption and lowering the energy barrier of NO3−-to-NH3 conversion. Consequently, the FeCoNi dual-scale shell-lattice metamaterials with high dislocation density achieve a Faraday efficiency of 95.4%, an NH3 yield rate of 20.58 mg h−1 cm−2, and long-term stability exceeding 500 hours.

 To achieve net-zero climate targets, many states have ramped up ambitions to decarbonize their economies. Despite these aspirations, the emerging decarbonization state faces a serious implementation gap between ambitious targets and actual policies, intensified by climate backsliding pressure. We argue that a deeper understanding of the prevalent model of the liberal capitalist state and its basic functions (that is, ensuring economic growth, maintaining legitimacy and providing security) can help to explain this gap. We conceptualize the nascent decarbonization state as increasingly aiming to shift from fossil fuels towards renewable energy rather than merely improving existing technologies.

 Urgent decarbonization is imperative, yet mineral scarcity may threaten low-carbon technology deployment, potentially challenging transition pathways. Here, through the analysis of 557 mitigation pathways from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report using the Global Resource Evaluation of Abatement Technologies model, we systematically quantify demand and potential shortages for 40 minerals critical to 17 energy technologies. We find that all pathways may experience global shortages of up to 12 minerals by 2100 under the moderate scenario, with more severe shortages of indium, tin, cadmium and tellurium related to thin-film photovoltaic, wind and nuclear power (>50% of pathways). Regional disparities would intensify these risks, particularly in developing, resource-vulnerable regions (for example, the Middle East and Africa), with potential shortages reaching 24 minerals. Hence, we propose better solutions that balance emissions reduction with resource constraints and regional equity, revealing that decarbonization requires more than technological innovation. It demands the strategic integration of diversified energy technology portfolios, aggressive recycling, material substitution and global trade cooperation, alongside moderate gross domestic product growth. The decarbonization of energy systems requires access to minerals that are critical for manufacturing low-carbon technologies.

 Coastal communities are increasingly vulnerable to long-term sea level rise and fluctuations driven by climate variability. While recent advances in coupled climate models enable sea level predictions several months in advance, further efforts are needed to assess and enhance seasonal prediction of coastal sea level. In this study, we evaluate seasonal prediction skill for large-scale and coastal sea level along the U.S. and Canadian West Coast using multiple forecast systems. Prediction skill peaks in the tropical Indo-Pacific and extends into the eastern North Pacific, declining from south to north along the coast. Using self-organizing maps (SOMs), a machine learning technique, we identify sources of large-scale sea level variability and predictability in the eastern tropical and North Pacific, closely linked to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation. Finally, we improve coastal sea level predictions from dynamical models by leveraging the connection between large-scale and coastal sea level through SOM-reconstructed and model-analog approaches."

 The Arctic Oscillation (AO) is a dominant atmospheric mode in the Northern Hemisphere, influencing weather and climate. Its variations are driven by numerous factors, including Arctic sea ice, particularly autumn Barents-Kara Sea ice concentration (SIC), which can significantly impact the AO through planetary wave dynamics. However, the interdecadal stability of this relationship remains unclear. This study detected the weakened November Barents-Kara SIC-January AO connection after the mid-1990s. Observational and model analysis showed that from 1979 to 1994, their relationship was driven by the North Atlantic tripole (NAT) sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, which influenced storm track activities over North Atlantic and Eurasia, thus inducing a wave train resembling the Scandinavian pattern. After the mid-1990s, weakened interannual variability of the NAT SST anomalies disrupted this mechanism. These findings highlight the critical role of mid-latitude ocean-atmosphere interactions in Arctic climate variability and emphasize the need for further research on long-term AO-SIC linkages."

 Glaciar Perito Moreno, located in the Southern Patagonian Icefields, has long been considered stable despite widespread regional glacier retreat. Unlike neighboring glaciers, its frontal position and surface elevation remained relatively unchanged - until recently. For lake-terminating glaciers, retreat is strongly controlled by their basal topography, which remains poorly known for Glaciar Perito Moreno. Here, we present helicopter-borne ground-penetrating radar and bathymetric data, along with time series of surface elevation and velocity. We detect an acceleration in frontal surface lowering rates, from 0.34 m a−¹ (2000–2019) to 5.5 m a−¹ (2019–2024), accompanied by glacier acceleration and retreat. Using a simple numerical model projecting current thinning into the future, we demonstrate the potential for large scale buoyancy-driven retreat once the glacier recedes beyond a subglacial ridge. These findings reveal a high sensitivity to frontal dynamics and suggest that Glaciar Perito Moreno may now be following a similar pattern of other retreating lacustrine calving glaciers in Patagonia.

 Climate change and human activity are reshaping coastal systems, yet global impacts on water clarity remain poorly quantified. Here we leverage remote sensing big data to develop a global model of coastal suspended particulate matter across continental coastal waters, and show that global coastal suspended particulate matter concentrations have declined by 0.28 mg L−1 annually since 2000, driven by natural processes and human intervention. Furthermore, the spatial extent of areas exceeding the 2000 global mean threshold has shifted landward at an average rate of 0.014 km year−1. Long-term sea level rise and diminished sediment delivery—driven by urbanization and expanding impervious surfaces—were the dominant drivers of this global clarification trend. In contrast, moderate increases in wave height and salinity enhanced resuspension, while larger shifts promoted suspended particulate matter settling.

 As humanity’s first sample return mission from the lunar farside, China’s Chang’E-6 mission provides a unique window into understanding the dichotomy in lunar nearside-farside evolution. Chang’E-6 landed in the southwestern Apollo basin (~2.79 Ga) within the South Pole–Aitken basin, providing a valuable record of early solar system impacts. Equipped with a Multi-Input-Multi-Output Lunar Regolith Penetrating Radar, the mission enabled the first detailed investigation of the shallow subsurface structure at the farside. By employing a tailored data processing approach, we obtained high-resolution subsurface images and revealed a distinct two-layer structure to a depth of 3 m. The upper layer (~1.7 m thick) consists of fine-grained, highly weathered regolith, while the lower layer (extending to 3 m) contains coarse, unweathered ejecta. Furthermore, by integrating data from Apollo and Chang’E missions, we identified a potential relationship between the lunar surface geological age and the shallow regolith’s electromagnetic losses. Specifically, geologically older regions exhibit lower electromagnetic attenuation, suggesting a possible link between regolith maturity and electromagnetic properties. These findings provide critical insights into the geological evolution of the Moon, and also offer unprecedented opportunities for correlating in-situ radar measurements with laboratory analyses of the farside samples, fundamentally advancing our understanding of lunar exploration.

 Marine heatwaves are prolonged periods of extreme ocean warming that can strongly impact marine ecosystems, fisheries, and aquaculture. In August 2024, northern Norway experienced one of its most intense marine heatwaves on record, with sea surface temperatures exceeding 18 °C—more than 4 °C above the long-term average. This event contributed to an unprecedented salmon lice outbreak at aquaculture sites, causing increased fish mortality and economic losses. Here we use numerical ocean model hindcast data, atmospheric reanalysis data, and in situ observations to identify the factors behind this event. Local weather conditions, including high solar radiation, unusually warm air temperatures, and weak winds, caused increased heat transfer to the sea surface and reduced ocean mixing. Additionally, large-scale atmospheric pressure patterns intensified warm air advection and freshwater transport along the coast, reinforcing local stratification and warming. These findings highlight the importance of advancing regional marine heatwave forecasting to support fisheries and aquaculture resilience under a warming climate.

 Microearthquakes generated by subsurface fluid injection record the evolving stress state and permeability of reservoirs. Forecasting their spatiotemporal evolution is therefore critical for applications such as enhanced geothermal systems, carbon dioxide sequestration and other geoengineering applications. Here we propose a transformer neural network model that ingests hydraulic stimulation history and prior microearthquake observations to forecast four key quantities: cumulative microearthquake count, cumulative logarithmic seismic moment, and the 50th- and 95th-percentile extents of the microearthquake cloud. Applied to the EGS Collab Experiment 1 dataset, the model achieves R2 > 0.98 for the 1-s forecast horizon and R2 > 0.88 for the 15-s forecast horizon across all targets, and supplies uncertainty estimates through a learned standard deviation term. These accurate, uncertainty-quantified forecasts enable real-time inference of fracture propagation and permeability evolution, demonstrating the strong potential of deep-learning approaches to improve seismic-risk assessment and guide mitigation strategies in future fluid-injection operations.

 The timeliness and accuracy of existing methods for crop type mapping within the growing season (i.e., within-season crop type mapping) are often limited by their ability to fully utilize dense time series observations, for example, because they use monthly composites. This study presents a novel and robust methodology that leverages every single good-quality observation in the time series and a trained model capable of achieving improved mapping accuracy using 30 m NASA Harmonized Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 (HLS) data for any time within-season across the conterminous U.S. (CONUS). A single pixel time series Transformer-based deep learning model was trained using seven years (2016–2022) of United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Cropland Data Layer (CDL) 30 m crop classifications, with > 1 million training pixels systematically sampled across the CONUS. The model was trained using only HLS data as input predictors to classify 37 crop types. The model can handle the irregular HLS time series without the need for temporal compositing by using a fixed-length time series input to accommodate sequences of any length, with time positions lacking good-quality observations masked out during classification via the Transformer's attention masking mechanism. The model was trained using different early growing season HLS time series portions defined up to a randomly selected end date each year and randomly removing some observations to account for variations in time series acquisition dates among years and locations. CONUS results for 2023 derived by classifying the HLS time series with progressively more growing season HLS data were presented and validated against the 2023 CDL. F1-scores > 0.8 were achieved for 15 crop classes by June 30, 20 classes by July 31, and 23 classes by August 31, 2023.

 Drought is a recurrent and severe hazard in Australia, exerting substantial pressure on ecosystems and human communities. Accurate drought assessment, reliant on precise estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) and soil moisture (SM), is critical for effective water resource management and irrigation planning. This study introduces the Relative Surface ET Index (RSETI), a novel drought indicator derived from the Normalized Difference Latent Heat Index (NDLI) using green, red, and short-wave infrared (SWIR) 1 bands. The drought-monitoring capabilities of RSETI, alongside existing indices, were evaluated using diverse datasets, such as downscaled Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) SM, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ET and Net Primary Productivity (NPP), flux tower data (ET, Gross Primary Productivity [GPP], and SM), Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) surface and root-zone SM, and Standardized Precipitation-ET Index (SPEI). Across Australia, the RSETI exhibited the highest correlation (r) with GLASS SM (0.78 ≤ r ≤ 0.82, p < 0.01) and showed greater sensitivity than other indices. The Temperature-Vegetation-Precipitation Dryness Index (TVPDI) indicated strong correlations with MODIS ET (r = 0.91) and NPP (r = 0.92), while the RSETI excelled in indicating ET and NPP, achieving highest r values of 0.94 and 0.91, respectively. Spatiotemporal correlations revealed strong consistency between the RSETI and datasets, namely SMAP Surface SM, MODIS ET and NPP, Vegetation Health Index (VHI), Temperature-Vegetation-SWIR Reflectance Dryness Index (TVSDI), and TVPDI, covering the majority of Australia. Validations using flux tower data showed that the RSETI outperformed TVPDI and TVSDI at most sites. Using Random Forest regression, monthly RSETI-based ET estimates for 2017–2019 showed strong agreement with MODIS ET (0.61 ≤ r ≤ 0.95), indicating its capability for ET monitoring. Given its capability to represent ET and SM, the RSETI was used to assess drought conditions in Australia from 2001 to 2022. The results identified severe drought events during the Millennium Drought (2001–2009) and Tinderbox Drought (2017–2019), highly affecting vegetation and water availability. Owing to its simplicity and broad applicability, the RSETI holds high potential for drought monitoring and offers valuable support for resilience planning and sustainable agriculture."

 Nighttime light data has been widely used in socioeconomic research and in studies related to light pollution. The most commonly used nighttime light global datasets include the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite Day/Night Band (VIIRS-DNB). However, the quantization level and spatial resolution of DMSP-OLS data are poor. A combined DMSP-OLS and VIIRS-DNB time series would be valuable, and we propose that the challenges associated with DMSP-OLS data can be overcome by integrating multi-resolution and multi-temporal data. This research introduces a new remote sensing index based on multi-source data fusion, which we use to improve the resolution and quantization range of DMSP-OLS nighttime light data through deep learning methods. The main results of the study are as follows: First, we propose a nighttime light enhancement index (NLEI) that can be used to develop synthetic DMSP-OLS data series with improved spatial resolution and quantization level. Second, features from VIIRS-DNB data and NLEI in 2013 are extracted and trained using a variational autoencoder framework based on the principle of zonal and blocking processing to obtain a simulated VIIRS-DNB dataset from 1992 to 2012. Finally, consistency verification with VIIRS-DNB data from 2012 shows a pixel level R2 validation of 0.94, and the R2 of accuracy verification at the provincial level is 0.98. The correlation coefficient values between the simulated VIIRS-DNB data from 1996, 2006, 2000, and 2010 and the corresponding DMSP-OLS radiance calibrated nighttime light (RNTL) product are 0.92, 0.94, 0.95, and 0.96, respectively. The simulated VIIRS-DNB dataset obtained in this study from 1992 to 2011 has a resolution of 500 m and higher quantization levels, which can be combined with VIIRS-DNB data to support economic, social, urban change and light pollution research from 1992 to 2022."

 Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have gained prominence as a machine learning technique for representing 3D scenes and estimating the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) from multiple images. However, most existing research has focused on close-range imagery, typically modelling scene surfaces with simplified Microfacet BRDF models, which are often inadequate for representing complex Earth surfaces. Furthermore, NeRF approaches generally require large sets of simultaneously captured images — a condition rarely met in satellite imaging. To overcome these challenges, we introduce BRDF-NeRF, which incorporates the physically-based semi-empirical Rahman–Pinty–Verstraete (RPV) BRDF model, known to better capture the reflectance properties of natural surfaces. Additionally, we propose guided volumetric sampling and depth supervision to enable radiance field modelling with a minimal number of views.

 Hyperspectral lithological mapping is a critical task in geological surveys and mineral resource exploration. However, the distribution of geological units is typically imbalanced and heterogeneous, with practical tasks requiring high-efficiency mapping over large regions. Traditional methods, such as patch-based and regular window approaches, struggle to effectively address these challenges. In this study, we propose a novel fast sample-based window lithological mapping (FSWLM) framework that integrates three key innovations: (1) a sample-based window strategy to reduce computational redundancy and improve efficiency, (2) an TFM (Threshold and Frequency Modulation)-based sampling strategy to address class imbalance during training, and (3) an encoder-decoder network characterized by feature-spectrum fusion (FSF) pattern. FSWLM offers an integrated solution tailored to the geological demands of lithological mapping, optimizing both efficiency and accuracy. Experimental validation on the Dajiling dataset, a geologically complex region in Tibet, demonstrates that FSWLM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classification accuracy, minor class recognition, and spatial coherence. These results underscore the effectiveness of the task-oriented framework in addressing the unique challenges of hyperspectral lithological mapping, with promising implications for large-scale geological surveys and mineral resource exploration."

 The fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution has been of great concern. Obtaining full-coverage PM2.5 is still difficult since the limited number of monitoring stations. Satellite datasets with wide spatial coverage and continuous distribution provide a potential solution for estimating full-coverage pollutant concentrations. A two-stage framework based on deep learning was constructed using multi-source satellite data and spatiotemporal variables for daily PM2.5 concentration estimation in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region. Firstly, an AOD imputation model based on linear residual network was proposed. It achieves the best level compared with other methods (R2 = 0.941, RMSE = 0.047). Secondly, a Spatiotemporal Lightweight Parallel Network (STLWPNet) with temporal and spatial modules was constructed to estimate daily PM2.5 concentration. For the first time, the temporal module used firstly Fourier attention and frequency attention to process the frequency domain signal, and introduced a novel second-order residuals algorithm and sequence decomposition for deep mining of temporal information. Meanwhile, the concept of lightweight 2D convolutional layer was innovatively proposed in the spatial module, which can process the spatial information and solve the shortcomings of the traditional methods with large computation. Finally, this model shows outstanding performance in sample-based 10-CV(R2 = 0.917, RMSE = 11.476 μg/m3).

 Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) is known for its substantial isoprene emissions, which can contribute to air pollution and climate change. As oil palm plantations expand across Southeast Asia, developing effective mitigation strategies such as propagating low-isoprene-emitting variants of this species is essential. To this end, we measured the isoprene emissions from oil palm saplings grown from seeds and clonally propagated under controlled environmental conditions in an E. guineensis nursery in Sessang, Malaysia. The effects of the leaf position, time of day, root conditions, and growth stage were examined for further data quality control. The first set of results showed that isoprene emissions varied more widely in seed-derived saplings (mean: 13.6 ± 5.2 nmol m−2 s−1) than in clonal saplings (mean: 18.6 ± 2.9 nmol m−2 s−1), with the latter exhibiting consistently higher emissions. Further investigation of the potential influencing factors revealed that isoprene emission rates varied with leaf position, with the upper and middle fronds producing more isoprene than lower fronds. Additionally, the emissions exhibited clear peaks in the morning or midday. Older trees exhibited significantly higher isoprene emission rates (26.32 ± 6.49 nmol m−2 s−1) than saplings, suggesting that the emissions change with growth stage. Based on these findings, we recommended that isoprene emission measurements be taken from the middle or upper leaves in the morning or at midday to ensure a reliable comparison. The substantial intraspecific variability in isoprene emission among E. guineensis saplings from crossbreeding highlights the potential for identifying and selecting low-emission variants."

 This study examines the optical and chemical characteristics of south Asian outflow across the northern Indian Ocean during the northern hemispheric winter of the year 2018, as part of the Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases, and Radiation Budget (ICARB) experiment. Our observations reveal a significant influence of anthropogenic aerosols on columnar aerosol optical depth (AOD) in the equatorial Indian Ocean, with anthropogenic AOD accounting for approximately 46 % of the composite aerosol load. Water-soluble anthropogenic ions (WSAI) emerge as the primary contributor to columnar AOD across most oceanic regions of the northern Indian Ocean, attributed to their high scaling distance compared to other dominant species such as organic carbon (OC) and black carbon (BC). The assessment of speciated aerosol radiative forcing indicates the primary contribution of BC to surface forcing in coastal regions, with WSAI (followed by BC and OC) exerting dominance in far oceanic areas. Overall, anthropogenic forcing, primarily from WSAI, OC, and BC, accounts for a substantial portion of the total forcing at the top of the atmosphere (72 %) and surface (89 %) over most of the cruise regions of the southeast Arabain Sea and the equatorial Indian Ocean, with atmospheric heating predominantly attributed to BC (84 %) exhibiting highest atmospheric absorbing efficiency of 13.38.

 Rainfall during the March–May (MAM) long rains is critical for agriculture, water resources, and food security across southern and southeastern East Africa. Yet, it exhibits strong interannual variability that challenges prediction and adaptation. While most studies have focused on the influence of tropical ocean sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, the role of the Southern Ocean in modulating East African rainfall remains poorly understood. This study investigates the impacts of SST anomalies in three key Southern Ocean regions, the South Atlantic Ocean (SAO), Southwestern Pacific Ocean (SWPO), and Southwestern Indian Ocean (SWIO) on MAM rainfall variability over East Africa during 1981–2023. We employ high-resolution CHIRPS precipitation data, ERSSTv5 SST records, and NCEP/NCAR atmospheric reanalysis, using empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis, correlation and regression techniques, and wave activity flux diagnostics to identify physical linkages. Results reveal that warm SST anomalies in the SAO and SWPO are significantly associated with enhanced MAM rainfall, primarily via strengthened Walker-type circulations, increased low-level moisture convergence, and upper-level divergence that favor deep convection. In contrast, SWIO warming suppresses rainfall by inducing low-level divergence and upper-level convergence, inhibiting convective activity. Upper-level wave trains originating from the SAO and SWPO further enhance rainfall by promoting upward motion, highlighting the importance of extratropical-tropical teleconnections. Combining SST indices from these regions into a synergistic index significantly enhances the predictability of rainfall. These findings underscore the need to incorporate Southern Ocean SST variability into seasonal forecasting frameworks to improve early warning and climate adaptation strategies for East Africa."

 Interpretable machine learning tools have enhanced the ability to model and analyze hourly variations in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations. These tools can distinguish the effects of multiple factors on PM2.5 levels and explore their non-linear relationships with PM2.5. This study analyzes hourly PM2.5 concentrations from two measurement sites in Kathmandu, Nepal, from 2017 to 2023. We use the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to quantify the impacts of forest fires, long-range transport, local emissions, and meteorology on PM2.5 levels. GAM simulation shows that the seasonal temperature component is the dominant driver, explaining 36% of the model variance and indicating strong seasonal influences on PM2.5 concentrations. We use hourly back trajectories, combined with the Fire INventory from NCAR (FINN), to estimate the impact of biomass burning, which contributes approximately 8 μg/m3 of the average 50 μg/m3 PM2.5 at the Phora Durbar site, mainly from Nepal’s forested areas. We determine the impact of long-range transport using Trajectory Cluster Concentration Impacts (TCCI) and observe that northwesterly air masses increase PM2.5 concentrations by up to 4 μg/m3 while southeasterly air masses reduce concentrations by up to 4 μg/m3. Diurnal variations and boundary layer height significantly influence PM2.5 levels, explaining 7% and 6% of the model variance, respectively, representing the influence of local emission. Overall, the GAM framework effectively quantifies the contributions of meteorology, forest fires, long-range transport, and local emissions to PM2.5 concentrations, highlighting the necessity of addressing these factors to improve air quality."

We show that the structural fluctuations manifest themselves in correlated variations of ion momenta obtained through coincident detection of the atomic fragments from individual molecules. Our analysis scheme allows extracting these variations, despite our measurements covering only a fraction of the full 33-dimensional momentum space, thereby establishing a general approach for extracting information on high-dimensional structural dynamics using Coulomb explosion."

In this work, we introduce a single-photon detection mechanism using highly photosensitive nonequilibrium electron phases in moiré materials. Using tunable bands in bilayer graphene/hexagonal boron nitride superlattices, we engineer negative differential conductance and a sensitive bistable state capable of detecting single photons. Operating in this regime, we demonstrate single-photon counting at mid-infrared (11.3 micrometers) and visible wavelengths (675 nanometers) and temperatures up to 25 kelvin. This detector offers prospects for broadband, high-temperature quantum technologies with complementary metal-oxide semiconductor compatibility and seamless integration into photonic-integrated circuits. Our analysis suggests that the underlying mechanism originates from superlattice-induced negative differential velocity."

These advancements depend on our ability to optimize the desirable versus undesirable effects of deformation twins, which are three-dimensional (3D) microstructural domains that form under mechanical stresses. Previously only characterized through surface or thin-film measurements, we present 3D in situ characterization of deformation twinning inside an embedded grain over mesoscopic fields of view using dark-field x-ray microscopy supported by crystal plasticity finite element analysis. The results revealed the role of triple junctions on twin nucleation and the sequence and irregularity of twin growth and showed that twin-grain junctions, twin-twin junctions, and twin boundaries were the sites of localized dislocation accumulation."

However, its practical use has been constrained by weak magnetoelectric effects and limited overall performance, particularly under mechanical strain. Herein, we fabricated robust magnetoelectric polymer-inorganic nanocomposites through an interfacial cocrystallization strategy. By leveraging diazonium chemistry on vanadium diselenide (VSe2) monolayers, we created a submolecular-flat interface between ferromagnetic VSe2and ferroelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanocrystals. This highly crystalline interface has few mobile polymer chains and thus limits energy dissipation and enhances interfacial energy transfer. The scalable composite films show exceptional magnetoelectric performance, with a magnetocapacitive coefficient of 23.6%. These films enable ultrafast magnetoelectric detection, approaching a 10-fold increase in speed compared with conventional sensors, and offer opportunities for integrating multifunctional materials such as thermoelectric coolers into wearable devices."

In this work, we describe PromoterAI, a deep neural network that accurately identifies noncoding promoter variants that dysregulate gene expression. We show that promoter variants with predicted expression-altering consequences produce outlier expression at both the RNA and protein levels in thousands of individuals and that these variants experience strong negative selection in human populations. We observed that clinically relevant genes in patients with rare diseases are enriched for such variants and validated their functional impact through reporter assays. Our estimates suggest that promoter variation accounts for 6% of the genetic burden associated with rare diseases."

Immunity’s operational toolbox contains diverse processes, such as phagocytosis, antigen recognition, cell killing, and secretion of cytokines and antibodies. Although immune cells interact with each other, they also communicate with cells typically associated with other organ systems, including the nervous, circulatory, metabolic, musculoskeletal, endocrine, and hematopoietic. This abundant cross-talk shows that immunity transcends defense and homeostasis: It is a network that participates in many physiological processes necessary for life. By accessing the circulation and inhabiting every tissue, leukocytes sense, interpret, and regulate biological processes. In this Review, we highlight recent studies that illustrate the often bidirectional and symbiotic relationships through which the immune system regulates physiology."

Males are more susceptible to the acute effects of viral disease and certain cancers, whereas females exhibit a more robust immune response that can make them prone to developing autoimmune complications. We reflect on the emerging appreciation of sex differences—governed by genetics, sex hormones, and environmental factors—in tissue immunity and immunology. Understanding these tissue context–dependent sex differences in the immune system is critical to deciphering the exact mechanisms that determine why women and men experience organ-specific infections, autoimmune or inflammatory diseases, and cancers differently. Only by parsing distinction at the tissue level can the development of personalized and precision immunotherapy approaches be conceived and then achieved."

We explore what generates or reduces immune variation, integrating recent empirical advances with potential overarching evolutionary principles. We posit that the multiple components of the immune system each present trade-offs (such as self-defense–self-harm, and investments in memory–retaining flexibility for future responses) that vary through life, and that variation in how immune components balance these trade-offs increases homeostasis to external and internal threats. Disentangling the mechanisms that shape immune diversity could inform effective strategies to manage microbial interactions and mitigate the burden of immune-mediated chronic diseases."

Stoye,Evolution of antiviral host defenses against a backdrop of endogenous retroelements,"Mammalian hosts deploy a multitude of germ line–encoded mechanisms to detect and restrict virus infection. These mechanisms must avoid pathological responses to endogenous retroviruses and other endogenous retrotransposable elements (RTEs)—viruses and viruslike genomic parasites that have invaded the host germ line and are passed down the generations as host genes. Although the location, specificity, and sensitivity of innate pattern recognition receptors and restriction factors are tuned to facilitate discrimination of infecting viruses from those that are part of self, immune cross-reactions do occur. The RTE viral heritage may, therefore, compromise the ability of the host to respond to virus infection without risking pathology. Nevertheless, RTEs have the potential to be co-opted as an alarm amplification system, to be repurposed as antiviral factors, and to contribute to the evolution of antiviral genes."
