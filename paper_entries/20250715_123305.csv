10.5194/acp-25-7299-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注气溶胶与云相互作用对气候的影响，特别是气溶胶-云相互作用的有效辐射强迫（ERFaci）。论文利用卫星观测数据和再分析数据，分析了低层云对气溶胶的辐射响应。研究发现，以往研究中假设的云滴数浓度与硫酸盐质量浓度之间的一对一关系是不准确的。通过精确模拟交叉验证，论文表明准确估计ERFaci的关键在于明确考虑气溶胶-云滴活化率。研究结果表明，ERFaci的值比之前的气候评估结果更小，不确定性更低，这意味着气溶胶-云相互作用对气候敏感性的影响可能比之前认为的要小。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是利用卫星观测进行大气成分分析和气溶胶、云的特性研究。,"['aerosol-cloud interactions', 'effective radiative forcing', 'satellite observations', 'cloud droplet number concentration', 'sulfate mass concentration', 'climate sensitivity', 'low-level clouds', 'radiative responses', 'climate models']",Chanyoung Park;Brian J. Soden;Ryan J. Kramer;Tristan S. L'Ecuyer;Haozhe He,Observational constraints suggest a smaller effective radiative forcing from aerosol–cloud interactions,"This study addresses the long-standing challenge of quantifying the impact of aerosol–cloud interactions. Using satellite observations, reanalysis data, and a ""perfect-model"" cross-validation, we show that explicitly accounting for aerosol–cloud droplet activation rates is key to accurately estimating ERFaci (effective radiative forcing due to aerosol–cloud interactions). Our results indicate a smaller and less uncertain ERFaci than previously assessed, implying the reduced role of aerosol–cloud interactions in shaping climate sensitivity. 
 The effective radiative forcing due to aerosol–cloud interactions (ERFaci) is difficult to quantify, leading to large uncertainties in model projections of historical forcing and climate sensitivity. In this study, satellite observations and reanalysis data are used to examine the low-level cloud radiative responses to aerosols. While some studies assume that the activation rate of cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) in response to variations in sulfate mass concentration (SO42-) has a one-to-one relationship, we find this assumption to be incorrect. Our analysis estimates a global mean activation rate of 0.35 ± 0.17 (90 % confidence) and demonstrates that explicitly accounting for the activation rate is crucial for accurate ERFaci estimation. This is corroborated through a “perfect-model” cross-validation using state-of-the-art climate models. Our results suggest a smaller and less uncertain value of the global ERFaci (−0.32 ± 0.21 W m−2 for SO42-, 90 % confidence) than recent climate assessments (e.g., −0.93 ± 0.7 W m−2, 90 % confidence), indicating that ERFaci may be less impactful than previously thought. Our results are also consistent with observationally constrained estimates of total cloud feedback and recent estimates that models with weaker ERFaci better match the observed hemispheric warming asymmetry over the historical period."
10.5194/acp-25-7245-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,"该研究论文主要关注化学传输模型（CMAQ）中干沉降参数化对气溶胶模拟的影响，特别是在西太平洋地区对矿物粉尘和人为气溶胶的模拟。论文通过比较不同的干沉降方案（S22, E20, P22），评估了它们对PM10浓度和气溶胶光学厚度（AOD）的影响。研究结果表明，E20方案在改善PM10模拟方面表现更佳，并能更好地捕捉高空观测数据。此外，论文还探讨了沙尘和黑碳等气溶胶的混合状态。虽然论文没有直接提及卫星观测或特定的遥感技术，但其对气溶胶光学厚度（AOD）的分析，以及对大气成分（如PM10、沙尘、黑碳）的关注，都与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为这些参数通常可以通过卫星遥感进行监测和反演。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术具有较强的相关性。","['air quality monitoring', 'aerosol optical depth', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'PM10', 'dust emission', 'black carbon', 'dry deposition']",Steven Soon-Kai Kong;Joshua S. Fu;Neng-Huei Lin;Guey-Rong Sheu;Wei-Syun Huang,Modeling CMAQ dry deposition treatment over the western Pacific: a distinct characteristic of mineral dust and anthropogenic aerosols,"The accuracy of the chemical transport model, a key focus of our research, is strongly dependent on the dry deposition parameterization. Our findings show that the refined CMAQ dust model correlated well with ground-based and high-altitude in situ measurements by implementing the suggested dry deposition schemes. Furthermore, we reveal the mixing state of two types of aerosols at the upper level, a finding supported by both the optimized model and measurements. 
 Dry deposition plays a vital role in the aerosol removal process from the atmosphere. However, the chemical transport model (CTM) is sensitive to the dry deposition parameterization but remains uncertain due to limited measurements of particle deposition. By utilizing the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) version 5.4 with the refined dust emission treatment, the East Asian dust (EAD) simulation during January 2023 and spring 2021 was constructed to evaluate the performance of dry deposition parameterizations, namely S22, E20, and P22. The results showed that the dry deposition parameterization could significantly impact the CMAQ dust concentration in the air. By implementing the E20 dry deposition scheme, the CMAQ simulation performance of the surface PM10 has been considerably improved, with a normalized mean bias (NMB) of −41.9 %, as compared to that from S22 (−47.01 %) and P22 (−53.90 %). The modeled PM10 pattern by E20 at the upper level (700 hPa) was mostly consistent with the observed PM10 at the Lulin Atmospheric Background Station (LABS; 23.47° N, 120.87° E; 2862 m a.s.l.), which is a typical background site in the western Pacific, particularly in capturing the peak value. The correlations (R) at high altitudes were well represented for E20 by 0.55, as compared to S22 (0.54) and P22 (0.46). Moreover, E20 improved the simulated PM10 concentrations and aerosol optical depth (AOD) values over the Asian continent during the multiple dust episodes in spring 2021, by an NMB of −25.43 % and −26.19 %, respectively. The noticeable reduction of the coarse-mode particle deposition velocity (Vd) was responsible for reducing the PM10 simulation underestimation. On 22–31 January 2023, the in situ measurement of the upper level observed the possibility of natural dust and anthropogenic aerosol. This is consistent with the CMAQ, which shows that both aerosol types displayed a clear “long dust–black carbon belt” along 15° N. It is revealed that an increase in surface resistivity (Rb) leads to a significant increase in dust mass concentration but a minor increase in black carbon (BC). We propose implementing the E20 dry deposition approach, particularly in PM10 simulation, to narrow the uncertainty of the CMAQ dust emission treatment."
10.5194/acp-25-7387-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文通过数值模拟，探讨了2016年台风“妮妲”期间粤港澳大湾区一次极端高臭氧事件的成因。论文利用WRF-Chem模型进行了包含30个成员的集合模拟，并结合自研的臭氧源解析方法，分析了高臭氧的形成机制，包括夜间残余层臭氧的保留、白天的光化学反应增强以及区域间的臭氧输送。研究结果表明，数值模型在模拟极端臭氧事件时存在不确定性，但通过集合模拟和源解析方法，可以更好地理解高臭氧的形成过程，这与大气环境遥感技术中的空气质量监测和大气成分分析密切相关。,"['ozone', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition', 'WRF-Chem model', 'ozone source apportionment']",Jinhui Gao;Hui Xiao,The skill at modeling an extremely high ozone episode varies substantially amongst ensemble simulation,"The ensemble simulation provides a solution to better reproduce and understand the extremely high ozone episode that occurred in the Great Bay Area when Typhoon Nida approached South China in summer 2016. Elevated temperatures and weak winds contributed to the increase in ozone precursors, resulting in enhanced ozone production. Large amounts of ozone aloft also contributed to the increase in surface ozone via vertical transport. Notably, ozone from Southeast Asia contributed through this mechanism. 
 Severe ozone pollution may occur in the Great Bay Area (GBA) when typhoons approach South China. However, numerical models often fail to capture the high ozone concentrations during the episodes, leading to uncertainties in understanding their formation mechanisms. This study conducted an ensemble simulation with 30 members (EMs) using the WRF-Chem model, coupled with a self-developed ozone source apportionment method, to analyze an extremely high ozone episode associated with Typhoon Nida in the summer of 2016. The newly proposed index effectively distinguished between well-performing (good) and poorly performing (bad) EMs. Compared to the bad EMs, the good EMs accurately reproduced surface ozone variations, particularly capturing the extremely high concentrations observed in the afternoon of 31 July. The formation of such high ozone levels was attributed to the retention of ozone in the residual layer at night and the enhanced photochemistry during the daytime. As Typhoon Nida approached, weak winds confined large amounts of ozone in the residual layer at night. The development of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) facilitated the downward transport of ozone aloft, contributing to the rapid increase in surface ozone in the following morning. The enhanced photochemistry was primarily driven by increased ozone precursors resulting from favorable accumulation conditions and enhanced biogenic emissions. During the period of high ozone concentrations, contributions from local and surrounding regions increased. Additionally, ozone from southeastern Asia could transport to the GBA at high altitudes and then contribute to surface ozone when the PBL developed."

Since 2017, additional temporally highly resolved precipitation measurements have been carried out by a precipitation gauge and an optical precipitation sensor at Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard. These new data facilitate the distinction between liquid and solid precipitation. Using reanalysis data, we also find that water vapor transport contributes strongly to precipitation and especially to extreme precipitation events. 
 Ground-based precipitation observations are sparse in the Arctic but are needed to better understand precipitation processes and to provide reference data sets for models and satellite products. This study presents new, temporally highly resolved precipitation measurements from a Pluvio precipitation gauge and a Parsivel disdrometer at the Arctic research station AWIPEV, part of the Ny-Ålesund Research Station, Svalbard. Using the information on the precipitation phase by Parsivel, we derived a temperature-dependent separation of precipitation into liquid and solid mass. The Pluvio precipitation amount and the Parsivel/temperature-based precipitation type were analyzed for the period August 2017–December 2021 and related to the presence of synoptic-scale weather systems, i.e., atmospheric rivers (ARs), cyclones and fronts, detected from ERA5 reanalysis data. ARs occurred only 8 % of the time at Ny-Ålesund but contributed to about 42 % of the total precipitation amount with a high liquid mass fraction (72 %). Cyclones occurred 20 % of the time and were associated with 39 % of the precipitation, mainly in solid form (62 %). Frontal systems play a minor role in the precipitation amount at Ny-Ålesund.  Extreme events, i.e., days with daily precipitation sums above the 98th percentile, contribute 18 % to the total precipitation amount. All of these events are related to enhanced water vapor transport, often in the form of ARs and in combination with fronts and a high liquid mass fraction. Liquid precipitation in winter is mainly connected to ARs. These new measurements will help to better characterize uncertainties in gauge-based precipitation observations and the local variability of precipitation."

Tardito Chaudhri;David S. Stevenson,Soil deposition of atmospheric hydrogen constrained using planetary-scale observations,"There remains a large uncertainty in the global warming potential of atmospheric hydrogen due to poor constraints on its soil deposition and, therefore, its lifetime. A new analysis of the latitudinal variation in the observed seasonality of hydrogen is used to constrain its surface fluxes. This is complemented with a simple latitude–height model where surface fluxes are adjusted from a prototype deposition scheme. 
 Quantifying soil deposition fluxes remains the greatest source of uncertainty in the atmospheric H2 budget.  A new method is presented to constrain H2 deposition schemes in global models using observations of the zonal mean H2 distribution and seasonality.  A “best-fit” scheme that reproduces the observed zonal-mean seasonality of atmospheric H2 at the planetary scale is found by perturbing a prototype deposition scheme based on soil temperature and moisture dynamics.  Comparing the best-fit and prototype schemes provides insight into how the prototype scheme may be improved to better reproduce observed seasonality.  The H2 signal driven by the prototype scheme is accurate compared to observations in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics but shows discrepancies in the Southern Hemisphere, with surface mixing ratios that are too high and seasonality that is too weak.  A best-fit scheme indicates that the function capturing the soil microbial consumption of H2 requires a shift of +2 to +3 months in the seasonality in the tropics, with peak uptake shifting from February to April in the southern tropics and from August to October in the northern tropics, compared with a prototype scheme sensitive to seasonal soil moisture driven by the shifting of the Intertropical Convergence Zone.  New constraints on the H2 surface flux at low latitudes are key to accurately modelling the H2 cycle in the Southern Hemisphere."

Kahn,Analysis of a saline dust storm from the Aralkum Desert – Part 1: Consistency between multisensor satellite aerosol products,"The Aralkum Desert is challenging for aerosol retrieval due to its bright, heterogeneous, and dynamic surfaces and the lack of in situ constraints on aerosol properties. The performance and consistency of satellite algorithms in observing Aralkum-generated saline dust remain unknown. This study compares multisensor UVAI (ultraviolet aerosol index), AOD (aerosol optical depth), and ALH (aerosol layer height) products and reveals inconsistencies and potential biases over the Aral Sea basin. 
 The Aralkum Desert presents a challenging environment for satellite aerosol observations due to its very bright, heterogeneous, and dynamic surfaces and the lack of in situ constraints on region-specific aerosol properties. We survey current global satellite algorithms capable of detecting the presence, column burden, and elevation of airborne dust over the Aral Sea basin. Discrepancies and potential biases in retrieved UV aerosol index (UVAI), mid-visible and thermal infrared optical depth (AOD), and layer height due to different assumptions on surface and aerosol properties are assessed. The results indicate that (1) UVAI products consistently delineate dust plume extent but show large positive values over turbid waters and salt flats due to enhanced surface absorption. (2) MODIS and VIIRS total and coarse-mode AOD retrievals show strong agreement over the Caspian Sea despite using different aerosol optical models. Over desert surfaces, all operational AOD products misclassify fresh dust plumes as clouds and exhibit strong nonlinear relationships. The NOAA EPS algorithm retrieves significantly lower AOD than others, although the agreement improves when a dust optical model is used. The MISR research algorithm produces higher, more consistent AOD and improved particle property retrievals compared to the MISR operational product. (3) Among four IASI infrared products, the LMD algorithm performs best in detecting dust plume features over both desert and water surfaces. (4) The EPIC aerosol optical centroid height (AOCH) product overestimates dust layer altitude under low aerosol loadings but exhibits good agreement with CALIOP in detecting the elevated dust characterized by well-defined upper boundaries. MISR height retrievals also align well with CALIOP and EPIC. IASI infrared retrievals are about 0.4 km higher than EPIC over dust-laden scenes. This study underscores the value of a synergistic, multisensor approach leveraging the complementary strengths of satellite aerosol products and calls for their appropriate application and careful interpretation when characterizing saline dust from the Aralkum Desert."

By integrating FLEXPART dispersion model outputs with ground-based ACTRIS lidar observations, the approach estimates Etna's volcanic particle emissions and highlights a significant enhancement in the forecast accuracy. 
 Modeling the dispersion of volcanic particles following explosive eruptions is critical for aviation safety. To constrain the dispersion of volcanic plumes and assess hazards, calculations rely on the accurate characterization of the eruption's source term, e.g., variation in emission rate and column height with time and the prevailing wind fields. This study introduces an inverse modeling framework that integrates a Lagrangian dispersion model with lidar observations to estimate emission rates of volcanic particles released during an Etna eruption. The methodology consists of using the FLEXPART model to generate source–receptor relationships (SRRs) between the volcano and the lidar system that observed the volcanic plume. These SRRs are then used to derive the emission rates based on observational data, including volcanic ash plume heights from the INGV-EO observatory and PollyXT lidar retrievals. We leverage data from the ACTRIS PollyXT lidar that operates at the PANhellenic GEophysical observatory of Antikythera of the National Observatory of Athens (PANGEA-NOA). The inversion algorithm utilizes lidar observations and an empirical a priori emission profile to estimate the volcanic particle source strength, accounting for altitude and time of the plume's evolution. Additionally, to study the impact that the wind fields have on volcanic ash forecasting, the experiment is repeated using fields that assimilate Aeolus wind lidar data. Our approach applied to the 12 March 2021 Etna eruption and accurately captures a dense aerosol layer between 8 and 12 km above the PANGEA-NOA station. Results show a minimal difference of the order of 2 % between the observed and the simulated ash concentrations. Furthermore, the structure of the a posteriori ash plume closely resembles the ash cloud image captured by the SEVIRI satellite above Antikythera island, highlighting the novelty of the inversion results. The presented inversion algorithm, coupled with Aeolus data, optimizes both the vertical emission distribution and Etna emission rates, advancing our understanding and preparedness for volcanic events."

We quantify the impacts of several processes that affect how biosphere–atmosphere interactions influence atmospheric chemistry and aerosols. Our findings highlight that the aerosol direct effect is sensitive to the processes studied. These results can inform future investigations of how the biosphere can affect atmospheric composition and climate. 
 Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), such as isoprene, impact aerosols, ozone and methane, adding uncertainty to assessments  of the climate impacts of land cover change. Recent United Kingdom Earth System Model (UKESM) developments allow us to study how various processes impact biosphere–atmosphere interactions and their implications for atmospheric chemistry, while advances in remote sensing provide new opportunities for assessing biases in isoprene alongside formaldehyde and aerosol optical depth (AOD).The standard setup of UKESM1.1 underestimates the regional formaldehyde column by up to 80 %, despite positive isoprene biases of over 500 %. Seasonal average AOD values are underestimated by over 60 % in parts of the Northern Hemisphere but overestimated (> 180 %) in the Congo.The effects of several processes are studied to understand their impacts on satellite–model biases. Of these, changing from the default to a more detailed chemistry mechanism has the greatest impact on the simulated trace gases. Here, the isoprene lifetime decreases by 50 %, the formaldehyde column increases by > 20 %, whilst reductions in upper-tropospheric oxidant mixing ratios decrease sulfate nucleation (−32 %). Organically mediated boundary layer nucleation and contributions to aerosol mass from isoprene oxidation decrease AOD values in the Northern Hemisphere, while revised BVOC emission factors and land cover representation affect the emissions of BVOCs and dust.The combination of processes substantially affects regional model–satellite biases, typically decreasing isoprene and AOD and increasing formaldehyde. We find significant differences in the aerosol direct radiative effects (+0.17 W m−2), highlighting that these processes may have substantial ramifications for impact assessments of land use change."

Hogan,Radiative closure assessment of retrieved cloud and aerosol properties for the EarthCARE mission: the ACMB-DF product,"Measurements made by three instruments aboard EarthCARE are used to retrieve estimates of cloud and aerosol properties. A radiative closure assessment of these retrievals is performed by the ACMB-DF processor. Radiative transfer models acting on retrieved information produce broadband radiances commensurate with measurements made by EarthCARE’s broadband radiometer. Measured and modelled radiances for small domains are compared, and the likelihood of them differing by 10 W m2 defines the closure. 
 Measurements made by three instruments aboard the EarthCARE satellite, plus data  from auxiliary sources, will be used synergistically to retrieve estimates of cloud and aerosol properties. The ACMB-DF processor consists of a continuous radiative closure assessment of these retrievals and is both described and demonstrated in this study. The closure procedure begins with 3D radiative transfer models (RTMs) acting on retrieved and auxiliary data. These models yield upwelling shortwave and longwave broadband radiances commensurate with measurements made by EarthCARE's multi-angle broadband radiometer (BBR). Measured and modelled radiances are averaged up to “assessment domains” that measure ∼ 21 km along-track by no more than 5 km across-track, centred on the retrieved cross-section of ∼ 1 km profiles, and are then combined, by angular distributions models (ADMs), to produce “effective” upwelling fluxes at top-of-atmosphere, denoted as FBBR and FRTM, respectively. Last, the probability pΔF^ of |FRTM−FBBR| being less than ΔF^ W m−2 is estimated recognizing as many sources of, assumed normally distributed, uncertainties as possible. For historical/programmatic reasons, ΔF^ is set to 10 W m−2, but that might change during EarthCARE's commissioning phase and with Sun angle. The closure process is demonstrated up to calculation of pΔF^ using four 400 km long portions of one of EarthCARE's test frames for which simulated passive measurements were computed by 3D RTMs. Note that this study, like the ACMB-DF process with real EarthCARE observations, does not comment explicitly on performance of retrieval algorithms."

Furthermore, the observed mole fractions are compared against the mean marine boundary layer product for the Northern Hemisphere. The comparisons of all the systems show good agreement in relation to the World Meteorological Organization/Global Atmosphere Watch network compatibility goal limits for CO2 and CH4. 
 Accurate and precise observations of atmospheric greenhouse gas mole fractions are crucial for understanding the carbon cycle. However, challenges can arise when comparing data between different observation sites owing to the different measurement routines and data formats used. To combat these challenges, different research infrastructures have been established in order to harmonize measurement routines and data processing and to make the data from different stations readily available. One of the few stations in the boreal region that observes atmospheric greenhouse gas mole fractions is the Pallas station, located atop Sammaltunturi fell in Finnish Lapland. The station's location above the arctic circle, far away from large settlements, makes it ideal for the measurement of background mole fractions. The station hosts instrumentation for two different research infrastructures – Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) and Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) – with completely independent measurement instruments, calibration standards, and sampling systems. We present the long-term time series of the mole fractions of CO2 and CH4 and their evolution, measured at the Pallas station, as well as a long-term comparison of the two instruments during the period when both have been installed. We find that the average difference in the hourly values for CO2 is < 0.01 ppm and for CH4 is 0.47 ppb. The trends and growth rated calculated for both instruments agree well. For a more detailed comparison, the ICOS and GAW systems were simultaneously audited by the ICOS Mobile Laboratory and the World Calibration Centre (WCC-Empa) of GAW, respectively. The audit results show good agreement between the different systems, with the differences ranging from −0.06 to 0.02 ppm for CO2 and from −0.24 to 0.30 ppb for CH4. No significant dependence on mole fraction values is found for the differences between the systems. However, for one of the instruments, we find a clear influence of sample drying, especially for CH4. We also compare the long time series with the marine boundary layer (MBL) reference values, derived by NOAA based on weekly air sample measurements in the Northern Hemisphere. For CO2, the values measured at Pallas are on average 1.9 ppm higher than the MBL for the Northern Hemisphere, and for CH4, they are 54 ppb higher. The difference is larger during summer for CO2 but not significantly for CH4."

Based on multiple environmental variables and soil profile data, this study used machine learning approaches to evaluate  the SOC stocks and their spatial distribution at a depth interval of 20–100 cm in various ecosystems. 
 Determining the distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) in subsoil (20–100 cm depth) is important with respect to the global C cycle and warming mitigation. However, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding the spatiotemporal dynamics of SOC within this layer. By integrating traditional depth functions with machine learning approaches, we quantified soil β values, which represent the relative rate of decline in SOC density with depth, and provided high-resolution assessments of SOC dynamics across global ecosystems, including cropland, grassland, and forestland. The estimated subsoil SOC densities were 62 Mg ha−1 (95 % CI: 52–73) for cropland, 70 Mg ha−1 (95 % CI: 57–83) for grassland, and 97 Mg ha−1 (95 % CI: 80–117) for forestland. SOC density exhibited a consistent decline with depth, ranging from 30 to 5 Mg ha−1 in cropland, 32 to 7 Mg ha−1 in grassland, and 40 to 13 Mg ha−1 in forestland, across 20 cm depth increments from 20 to 100 cm. The estimated global subsoil SOC stock was 803 Pg C, with cropland, grassland, and forestland contributing 74, 181, and 547 Pg C, respectively. On average, 57 % of this carbon was stored within the top 0–100 cm of the soil profile. This study provides information on the vertical distribution and spatial patterns of SOC density at a 10 km resolution across global ecosystems, providing a scientific basis for future studies pertaining to Earth system models.

Ford;Gemma Kulk;Shubha Sathyendranath;Jamie D. Shutler,Decadal and spatially complete global surface chlorophyll-a data record from satellite and BGC-Argo observations,"Chlorophyll-a is routinely monitored using ocean colour satellites, however, these data records have gaps. Here we present a methodology to provide a spatially and temporally complete chlorophyll-a record, using Biogeochemical Argo floats as a constraint on wintertime chlorophyll-a, and a statistical kriging approach to fill cloud gaps. Thereby, providing a complete record at monthly 0.25° resolution between 1997 and 2023, consistent to the underlying climate data record. 
 Decadal-scale satellite-based climate data records of chlorophyll-a (chl-a), an essential climate variable, are now readily available at high accuracy and precision. These data are being extensively used for research and, increasingly, for operational services. However, these observations rely on availability of sunlight and the satellite sensor being able to view the ocean, so there are gaps in data due to the presence of clouds and more widely during the polar winter. This is an issue when spatially complete data are needed for global climate studies, or as inputs to machine learning methods and for data assimilation. Whilst addressing cloud cover is well studied, methodologies to overcome missing data due to the polar winter has received little attention and simple approaches to overcome these gaps can lead to unrealistic values. Biogeochemical Argo (BGC-Argo) floats have widely been deployed, and they represent an opportunity to address these gaps. We present an approach that combines BGC-Argo data and a satellite chl-a climate data record to produce a spatially and temporally complete, global monthly chl-a record between 1997 and 2023 at 0.25° spatial resolution. Clouds gaps were filled using an established spatial kriging approach. Polar wintertime chl-a were reconstructed using relative changes between the wintertime BGC-Argo chl-a, and the previous autumntime or next springtime satellite observations, for individual hemispheres. Uncertainties were calculated on a per-pixel basis to retain the underlying uncertainty fields in the climate data record and were modified to account for the uncertainties related to the gap filling. The seasonal cycles in the resulting polar data are consistent with light availability. Clear interannual and inter-hemisphere variability in the wintertime chl-a were observed. Independent assessment of solely the gap filled wintertime chl-a estimates against in situ data (N = 204 total) indicates that the accuracy and precision of the underlying satellite data, a key component of a climate data record, are maintained. The 25 year global and spatially complete chl-a data, that are consistent with the underlying climate data record can be downloaded from Zenodo (Ford et al., 2025b)."

Hansen,An Accurate 10 m Annual Crop Map Product of Maize and Soybean Across the United States,"We developed the first annual, 10-m spatial resolution maize and soybean maps over the US from 2019 to 2022. Evaluated by ground data collected over a stratified random sample, our maps achieved > 95 % overall accuracy consistently. Our analysis suggested that mixed pixels could be substantially reduced by the increased spatial resolution from 30 m to 10 m. Our maps can support research subjects such as forecasting crop yield, analyzing agricultural-related greenhouse gas emissions, etc. 
 High-resolution crop maps over large spatial extents are fundamental to many agricultural applications; however, generating high-quality crop maps consistently across space and time remains a challenge. In this study, we improved a workflow for crop mapping and developed the first openly available, annual, 10-m spatial resolution maize and soybean maps over the Contiguous United States (CONUS) from 2019 to 2022, available at the Global Land Analysis and Discovery at the University of Maryland (https://glad.umd.edu/projects/mapping-crops-10-m-resolution-united-states). We obtained all available Sentinel-2 surface reflectance data between May and October for every year, applied quality assurance, corrected the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) effects, and generated 10-day analysis ready data (ARD) composites. We then derived multi-temporal metrics from the 10-day ARD as training features for the national-scale wall-to-wall mapping. We implemented a stratified, two-stage cluster sampling, and then conducted annual field surveys and collected ground data. Utilizing the training data with Sentinel-2 multi-temporal metrics and topographic factors, we trained random forest models generalized for annual maize and soybean classification separately. Validated using field data from the two-stage cluster sample, our annual maps achieved consistent overall accuracies (OA) greater than 95 % with standard errors of less than 1 %. User’s accuracies (UAs) and producer’s accuracies (PAs) for maize were higher than 91 % and 84 % across the years, and UAs and PAs for soybean were greater than 88 % and 82 %, respectively. To illustrate the substantial improvement of the 10-m map over existing datasets, e.g., the 30-m Cropland Data Layer (CDL), we aggregated the 10-m maps to 30-m spatial resolution and quantified the amount of 30-m mixed pixels that can be reduced at field, regional, and national levels. The counties with the most maize and soybean production in Iowa, Illinois and Nebraska had the lowest reduction in mixed pixels, ranging from 1 % to 10 %, whereas southern counties had a higher reduction in mixed pixels. Overall, the median percentages of mixed maize and soybean pixels reduction across all counties were 14 % and 16 %, respectively. With more Sentinel-2-like data available from continuous observations and incoming satellite missions, we anticipate that 10-m crop maps will greatly benefit long-term monitoring for agricultural practices from the field to global scales. The dataset is also available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28934993.v1 (Li et al., 2025)."

However, the molecular mechanism of phosphate (P) immobilization on CCCFe remains largely unknown. In this study, batch experiments were conducted to investigate the immobilization mechanisms of P on CCCFe with low and high Fe loadings (CCCFel vs CCCFeh) using P K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy with surface-sensitive total electron yield (P-XANESTEY) and bulk-sensitive fluorescence yield (P-XANESFLY) modes. Results indicated that the high Fe loading inhibited calcite formation but favored vaterite production in the CCC and enhanced its P retention capacity. Hydroxyapatite (HAP) dominated over ferrihydrite-associated P (Fe–P) in the bulk of P sorbed on the CCCFeh, but amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) dominated over HAP for the CCC, suggesting Fe-induced transformation of the ACP to the HAP. Furthermore, the P-XANESTEY analysis indicated brushite primarily formed on the surface of the P sorbed on the CCCFeh at high P loading. Consistently, the spherical aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy analysis directly revealed ferrihydrite coating on the CCC and the presence of Ca–P and Fe–P associations. This study provides new molecular-level insights into Fe-tuned depth-dependent transformation of P on the CCC, thus benefiting P management in the CCC-enriched environmental settings."

Engineered nonsewered sanitation (NSS) technologies can meet treatment requirements without sewers, but their relative sustainability varies across potential deployment sites. Here, we characterize the costs and carbon intensity (CI) of three emerging NSS technologies, two community reinvented toilets (CRTs) and one Omni Processor (OP), across 77 countries, identify sustainability performance typologies, and map typology prevalence in countries across the globe. Locality-specific factors such as wages, diet, and material costs drive regional variability in NSS costs by up to 15-fold and CI up to 2-fold within technologies. Across all three NSS technologies and all scenarios evaluated, costs ranged from 0.01 to 0.36 USD·capita–1·day–1 and CIs ranged from 8 to 269 kg CO2 eq·capita–1·year–1. Low-cost, low-CI typologies are predominantly in countries with lower human development indices (HDI 2–4), demonstrating alignment between the sanitation need and the NSS opportunity space. Ultimately, the intent of this work is not to imply one-size-fits-all solutions for individual countries; by elucidating key sustainability drivers and defining typologies, this work can support early-stage decision-making for NSS technology research, development, and deployment."

This study systematically evaluates airborne distribution dynamics, surface deposition patterns, and human exposure risks associated with meperfluthrin-based mosquito-repellent incenses (disc, electric liquid, and electric mat) under the conditions of open and closed windows. The highest concentration of meperfluthrin derived from disc incense in the respiratory zone (0.0223 mg/m3) was 2–3-fold higher than other electric incenses (0.0075–0.0078 mg/m3). More than 73.8% of the active ingredient of mosquito-repellent incense can be transferred into the water system through cleaning activities. Quantitative risk assessment indicated an acceptable level of risk (risk quotients <1) for all products under recommended conditions of use. However, biomonitoring revealed a ubiquitous urinary presence of the meperfluthrin metabolite trans-DCCA in 100% of residential samples (0.1373–3.3027 μg/g creatinine, n = 19), suggesting bioaccumulation potential. Acute exposure experiments in mice revealed that the disc incense induced a 23-fold elevation in serum trans-DCCA levels compared to electric incenses, in addition to a significant increase in the levels of hepatotoxicity biomarkers (alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase).

Herein, 12-week-old Long-Evans rats were exposed to smoldering eucalyptus smoke with concentrations ranging from 3.52–23.7 mg/m3 for 7 total days (1 h/day) over a 10-day period, aligning with sperm maturation. An additional subset of rats was exposed to the filtered fraction of the lowest concentration, removing particulate matter from the smoke emission. At ∼24 h following the final exposure, the percentage of sperm with progressive tracking was reduced with whole smoke exposure (11 mg/m3). This reduction was accompanied by a decrease in the average path velocity (VAP) of sperm. While these effects were lost at the 3.52 mg/m3 concentration, interestingly, filtration of the particulate matter from this exposure reduced progressive motility and nearly all measures of sperm kinetics including VAP, straight line velocity (VSL), and the amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH). Data from this study provides evidence that acute exposure to eucalyptus smoke during a sensitive window of the sperm lifecycle (maturation) impairs sperm motility, an effect that may be attributed to the volatile phase of eucalyptus combustion."

Although such a world is unrealistic, addressing this question would reveal the role tropical cyclones (TCs) play in modulating the climate system. In this study, we begin to address this question by introducing a novel algorithm for reducing TC activity in TC‐permitting global climate models (GCMs) through suppression of wind‐induced surface heat exchange (WISHE) at grid points where TC‐like conditions are detected. This algorithm, abbreviated as “SWISHE,” was implemented in a suite of GCM simulations developed by NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory and compared to a control suite of simulations with no perturbations. Application of SWISHE resulted in a model‐mean 44% reduction of TC frequency compared to control simulations, with TCs of hurricane‐strength reduced by approximately 90%. Aggregate analysis of TCs reveals that TCs in the SWISHE simulations are weaker, as peak 10‐m horizontal wind speeds decrease by a model‐mean of 3.9 m s−1 and minimum sea‐level pressures increase by a model‐mean of 4.7 hPa. Composite analysis is used to confirm that SWISHE effectively suppressed latent heat fluxes in grid cells with TC‐like conditions. The results presented herein are intended to provide a first step in establishing methodology to understand upscale impacts of TCs on the climate system."

In addition, anthropogenic OC was notably high during winter (93 ± 7%) and autumn (74 ± 5%), underscoring the significant impact of regional pollution transport on background aerosol. Correlations between anthropogenic pollutants and biogenic‐derived SOC indicated that mixed contributions from anthropogenic and biogenic emissions promoted SOA formation. This interaction may partially explain the relatively higher fractions of SOC in nonfossil (>60%) and fossil OC (>70%) at the background site of the YRD region compared to other global background sites."

 Realizing universal fault-tolerant quantum computation is a key goal in quantum information science [1, 2, 3, 4]. By encoding quantum information into logical qubits utilizing quantum error correcting codes, physical errors can be detected and corrected, enabling substantial reduction in logical error rates [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. However, the set of logical operations that can be easily implemented on such encoded qubits is often constrained [12, 1], necessitating the use of special resource states known as ‘magic states’ [13] to implement universal, classically hard circuits [14]. A key method to prepare high-fidelity magic states is to perform ‘distillation’, creating them from multiple lower fidelity inputs [15, 13]. Here we present the experimental realization of magic state distillation with logical qubits on a neutral-atom quantum computer. Our approach makes use of a dynamically reconfigurable architecture [16, 8] to encode and perform quantum operations on many logical qubits in parallel. We demonstrate the distillation of magic states encoded in d  =  3 and d  =  5 color codes, observing improvements of the logical fidelity of the output magic states compared to the input logical magic states. These experiments demonstrate a key building block of universal fault-tolerant quantum computation, and represent an important step towards large-scale logical quantum processors."

 Gut microbiota influence the antitumour efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade1–6, but the mechanisms of action have not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that a new strain of the bacterial genus Hominenteromicrobium (designated YB328) isolated from the faeces of patients who responded to programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) blockade augmented antitumour responses in mice. YB328 activated tumour-specific CD8+ T cells through the stimulation of CD103+CD11b− conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), which, following exposure in the gut, migrated to the tumour microenvironment. Mice showed improved antitumour efficacy of PD-1 blockade when treated with faecal transplants from non-responder patients supplemented with YB238. This result suggests that YB328 could function in a dominant manner. YB328-activated CD103+CD11b− cDCs showed prolonged engagement with tumour-specific CD8+ T cells and promoted PD-1 expression in these cells. Moreover, YB238-augmented antitumour efficacy of PD-1 blockade treatment was observed in multiple mouse models of cancer. Patients with elevated YB328 abundance had increased infiltration of CD103+CD11b− cDCs in tumours and had a favourable response to PD-1 blockade therapy in various cancer types. We propose that gut microbiota enhance antitumour immunity by accelerating the maturation and migration of CD103+CD11b− cDCs to increase the number of CD8+ T cells that respond to diverse tumour antigens. A newly identified bacterial strain (YB328) isolated from the faeces of patients who responded to immune checkpoint blockade therapies can promote antitumour immunity through the activation of tumour-specific CD8+ T cells."

Here, the authors use antiCRISPR to enhance genome-wide CRISPR screening in Drosophila and generate higher-resolution maps of cell fitness, toxin, and drug-resistance. 
 CRISPR screens enable systematic, scalable genotype-to-phenotype mapping. We previously developed a CRISPR screening method for Drosophila melanogaster and mosquito cell lines using plasmid transfection and site-specific integration to introduce single guide (sgRNA) libraries. The method relies on weak sgRNA promoters to avoid early CRISPR-Cas9 activity causing discrepancies between genome edits and integrated sgRNAs. To address this issue and utilize higher strength sgRNA expression, we introduce a method to co-transfect a plasmid expressing anti-CRISPR protein to suppress early CRISPR-Cas9 activity which we term “IntAC” (integrase with anti-CRISPR). IntAC dramatically improves precision-recall of fitness genes across the genome, allowing us to generate the most comprehensive list of cell fitness genes yet assembled for Drosophila. Drosophila fitness genes show strong correlation with human fitness genes and underscore the effects of paralogs on gene essentiality. We also perform a resistance screen to proaerolysin, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-(GPI)-binding pore-forming toxin, retrieving 18/23 expected and one previously uncharacterized GPI synthesis gene. We also demonstrate that an IntAC sublibrary enables precise positive selection of a transporter under solute overload. IntAC represents a straightforward enhancement to existing Drosophila CRISPR screening methods, dramatically increasing accuracy, and might also be broadly applicable to virus-free CRISPR screens in other cell and species types. Genome-wide CRISPR screens map how genes support survival and contribute to diverse biological functions.

 An inflammatory process may increase the risk of arrhythmias after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). In this single-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial we investigated the efficacy of colchicine to reduce a composite of new-onset atrial fibrillation or atrioventricular conduction disturbances requiring the implantation of a permanent pacemaker at 30 days after TAVR. Between September 21, 2021 and April 25, 2024, 120 patients with aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR (mean age 80.6 ± 5 years, 64% male) were randomly allocated to treatment with colchicine (n = 60) or placebo (n = 60). The trial was prematurely stopped due to a higher rate of stroke in the experimental group in a pre-specified interim analysis (5 [8.3%] versus 0 at maximum available follow-up, p = 0.022). In the intention-to-treat population, the primary endpoint occurred in 6 patients (10%) in the colchicine group and in 15 patients (25%) in the placebo group (risk-difference −15.0%, 95% CI −28.3 to −1.7, p = 0.031). The prespecified imaging endpoint, subclinical leaflet thrombosis, was detected in 13 of 48 patients (27%) in the colchicine group versus 26 of 48 patients (54%) in the placebo group (risk difference −27.1%. 95% CI −46.0% to −8.2%, p = 0.007). Here, we show that periprocedural treatment with colchicine may reduce the incidence of new-onset arrhythmias and subclinical leaflet thrombosis after TAVR. However, given the premature termination of the trial due to an unexpected increase in the stroke rate among patients treated with colchicine, confirmatory trials are warranted to corroborate the effect of anti-inflammatory treatment on the incidence of arrhythmias and subclinical leaflet thrombosis after TAVR. The trial was an investigator-initiated study supported by dedicated grants from the Bangerter-Rhyner Foundation and the Swiss Life Foundation. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04870424.

 Catalysts featuring multiple active sites hold significant potential for CO2 photoconversion to multi-carbon products. However, multi-metal-site catalysts typically face challenges with low yields and selectivity for ethylene production, with a lack of definitive design guidelines. Here we show that Bader charge can serve as a critical descriptor for delineating the structure–activity relationship of kesterite-like nanosheets in the reduction of CO2 to ethylene. We propose the Bader-Regulate-Performance principle — apposite Bader charge can provide a moderate energy barrier for intermediate adsorption and C-C coupling simultaneously, thus promoting the performance for ethylene generation. Among the predicted multi-metal-site nanosheets, the Cu2ZnSnS4, with the appropriate Bader charge, achieves a high ethylene yield of 25.16 µmol g−1 h−1 with electron selectivity of 72.4% under visible light irradiation, surpassing those of reported photocatalysts under similar catalytic conditions. Our findings provide crucial insights into the design of efficient catalysts for photocatalytic CO2 conversion to multi-carbon products.

Here, the authors engineer semiconductor coated upconversion nanohybrids for the synergistic actions of ultrasound and near-infrared light that promote drug penetration and reactive oxygen species-mediated disruption of Candida albicans biofilms. 
 Fungal biofilms, as self-produced extracellular polymeric substances that resist antifungal agents and immune defense, represent a major cause of treatment failure and recurrent infections. Therefore, it is of great importance to eradicate fungal biofilms to achieve efficient therapy. This study develops a synergistic reactive oxygen species (ROS)-enhanced strategy to eradicate Candida albicans biofilms by designing ultrasound-light dual-responsive nanohybrids (UCNP@CR). The system integrates thulium-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) with carbon nitride-coated surfaces (g-C3N4) and polypyridine ruthenium complex (Ru) photosensitizers. In treatment, the dense fungal biofilm can be effectively loosened under ultrasound stimulation while ultrasound simultaneously triggers ROS production of UCNP@CR, collectively promoting irreversible destruction of biofilm and inward penetration of photosensitizer. Moreover, UCNP@CR exhibits strong fungal adhesion, while its g-C3N4-mediated enhanced metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) process of Ru under near-infrared light irradiation amplifies ROS generation, which leads to efficient eradication of fungal biofilms. As in vivo experimental evidence, UCNP@CR exhibits excellent antifungal efficacy in treating fungal biofilm-infected wounds in immunosuppressed male mice under ultrasound-light stimulation. These findings establish the ultrasound-assisted, ROS-enhanced synergistic strategy as a promising approach against fungal biofilm infections and provide diverse perspective for managing other biofilm-related infectious diseases.

 Half-Heusler compounds are promising thermoelectric materials for high-temperature applications, yet their performance is limited by high lattice thermal conductivity. Here, we present an alternative approach to synthesize ZrNiSn-based half-Heusler compounds with hierarchical architectures across multiple length scales. By utilizing short-duration mechanical alloying to produce nonequilibrium precursors, followed by reactive sintering, we enable precise control over phase composition and microstructural features. This approach results in multi-scale architectures comprising interstitial defects, grain boundaries, nanoprecipitates, and pores, enabling strong phonon scattering. The optimized Zr0.75Hf0.25NiSn0.99Sb0.01 alloy exhibits a lattice thermal conductivity as low as 1.9 W m−1 K−1 and a high power factor of 50 µW cm−1 K−2, yielding an impressive dimensionless figure of merit (zT) of 1.33 at 873 K. This performance surpasses that of ZrNiSn-based compounds synthesized via conventional methods such as arc melting and solid-state reaction. Our method, distinguished from conventional melting synthesis approaches through its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and scalability, provides a versatile framework for achieving efficient hierarchical phonon scattering while preserving high carrier mobility in half-Heusler compounds and highlights the potential of reactive sintering for advancing thermoelectric materials.

 Arousal is fundamental for affective experience and, together with valence, defines the core affective space. Precise brain models of affective arousal are lacking, leading to continuing debates of whether the neural systems generalize across valence domains and are separable from those underlying autonomic arousal or wakefulness. Here, we combine naturalistic fMRI with predictive modeling to develop a brain affective arousal signature (BAAS, discovery-validation design, n = 60, 36). We demonstrate its (1) sensitivity and generalizability across mental processes, valence, and stimulation modality and (2) neural distinction from autonomic arousal and wakefulness (24 studies, n = 868). Affective arousal is encoded in distributed cortical-subcortical (e.g., prefrontal, periaqueductal gray) systems with local similarities in thalamo-amygdala-insula systems between affective and autonomous arousal. We demonstrate application of the BAAS to improve specificity of established valence-specific neuromarkers.

Now a study explores the potential benefits of solar installations in open-pit mines around the world. 
 Climate action requires rapid scaling of solar energy while minimizing land conflicts. Solar farms often compete with agriculture and ecosystems, but repurposing abandoned mines could offer a solution. We assess global open-pit mining sites as potential solar hubs, analysing their technical feasibility and deployment timelines under diverse future scenarios. Using a residual artificial neural network and energy demand projections, we find that these disturbed lands could host solar installations covering around 48,000 km2—ten times the global solar footprint in 2018. Their total generation potential (4,764 TWh yr−1) could meet projected 2050 global electricity needs. While Mediterranean countries show the highest readiness for mine-to-solar conversions, African nations lag despite having optimal sunlight owing to infrastructure and policy barriers. Our scenario analysis reveals that deployment timing and scale depend heavily on economic growth, clean energy costs and fossil fuel prices—with aggressive transitions requiring solar capacity exceeding current mine areas by 106%. This study provides a road map for strategically aligning solar expansion with post-mining land revitalization.

 Despite advances in climate modeling, simulating the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) remains challenging due to its spatiotemporal diversity and complexity. To address this, we build upon existing model hierarchies to develop a new unified modeling platform, which provides practical, scalable, and accurate tools for advancing ENSO research. Within this framework, we introduce a dual-core ENSO model (DCM) that integrates two widely used ENSO modeling approaches: a linear stochastic model confined to the equator and a nonlinear intermediate model extending off-equator. The stochastic model ensures computational efficiency and statistical accuracy. It captures essential ENSO characteristics and reproduces the observed non-Gaussian statistics. Meanwhile, the nonlinear model assimilates pseudo-observations from the stochastic model while resolving key air-sea interactions, such as oceanic feedback balances and spatial patterns of sea surface temperature anomalies during El Niño peaks. The DCM effectively captures the realistic dynamical and statistical features of the ENSO diversity and complexity. The computational efficiency of the DCM also facilitates a rapid generation of extended ENSO datasets, overcoming observational limitations."

A direct link between the two has, however, not yet been established. Here we show, using a large set of simulations from eight Earth System Models, how a time-evolving 75% reduction in East Asian sulfate emissions partially unmasks greenhouse gas-driven warming and influences the spatial pattern of surface temperature change. We find a rapidly evolving global, annual mean warming of 0.07 ± 0.05 °C, sufficient to be a main driver of the uptick in global warming rate since 2010. We also find North-Pacific warming and a top-of-atmosphere radiative imbalance that are qualitatively consistent with recent observations. East Asian aerosol cleanup is thus likely a key contributor to recent global warming acceleration and to Pacific warming trends. Restrictions of atmospheric aerosol and precursor emissions in East Asia have contributed to the observed global surface warming acceleration since 2010, according to Earth System Model simulations isolating regional changes."

 Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi stimulate particulate and mineral-associated organic carbon formation and stabilization through hyphae residue, glomalin-related soil proteins gluing, and mycelium entangling. However, how grassland patches affect arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi- and glomalin-related soil proteins-mediated soil organic carbon formation and stabilization remains unclear. Here, we measured arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi diversity, glomalin-related soil proteins content, and plant- and microbial-derived carbon in particulate and mineral-associated organic carbon, through sampling of grassy, shrubby, degraded, and exposed patches. We found microbial-derived carbon dominates particulate and mineral-associated organic carbon formation. Decreased microbial- and plant-derived carbon in these fractions may relate to reduced arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi diversity in degraded patches, because fungal necromass carbon correlated more strongly with diversity decline than bacterial necromass. Grassland patches decrease arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi diversity and glomalin-related soil proteins content but stimulate their proportion, the cementation of glomalin-related soil proteins protect microbial-derived carbon from degradation, increasing its accumulation in both carbon fractions. Decreasing arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi diversity led to the loss of microbial-derived carbon and regulated the particulate and mineral-associated organic carbon by stimulating the glomalin-related soil proteins, according to a soil sampling analysis in an alpine grassland on the Tibetan Plateau."

 The Gulf Stream forms part of the upper-ocean limb of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, playing an essential role in redistributing heat northward and greatly influencing regional climates in the North Atlantic. Understanding Gulf Stream path and strength variability on pre-instrumental timescales is vital to contextualise its proposed present-day weakening and to better appreciate its sensitivity to external forcing. Here we present a 564 year-long monthly resolved terrestrial palaeo-oceanographic temperature record derived from a Bermudan stalagmite, spanning 1449 to 2013 in the Common Era. Our reconstruction suggests that the Gulf Stream migrated northward as the Little Ice Age abated, after a combination of reduced Gulf Stream transport, enhanced Labrador Current and Deep Western Boundary Current transport, and an extended negative North Atlantic Oscillation phase had likely forced its path southward.

 Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), a perennial legume forage crop, is valued for its high yield and quality. However, its survival during winter can be affected by several factors, and its mortality significantly impacts alfalfa production, necessitating timely and spatially detailed monitoring. This study aims to propose a framework for estimating alfalfa stem density using satellite imagery and machine learning (ML) algorithms, which can lead to winter mortality detection early in the spring and provide a better understanding of potential total dry matter. Three ML models—support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB)—were applied to Harmonized Landsat Sentinel (Landsat only, which is HLSL30) and Sentinel-2 datasets, accessed via the Google Earth Engine (GEE) Python API. Two scenarios were evaluated: 1) single-date data, capturing satellite images within a 3-day time window to the date of field sample measurement, and 2) time-series data, in which three satellite images were collected for the measurements during the first growing cycle. Both classification and regression models were used in both scenarios to estimate and classify alfalfa stem density. ML Classification models categorized stem density into four groups (bare, low-density, medium-density, and high-density), achieving an accuracy of up to 85 % using Sentinel-2 data and 84 % using HLSL30 data. The results also indicated that alfalfa stem density can be estimated with an error of ∼ ±6-9 stems/foot2 (1 foot = 30.48 cm) using ML regression models. RF outperformed XGB and SVM in classification and regression tasks, showing superior accuracy in classifying density and lower root mean square error (RMSE) in estimating stem density. Our proposed framework model can offer valuable information to growers and decision-makers, enabling them to make timely and informed decisions."

 Multi-view reconstruction of real-world scenes has been an important and challenging task. Although methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have made significant progress in rendering quality, there are still some limitations regarding the fidelity of geometric structures. To address this challenge, we propose a novel 3D reconstruction approach within the 3DGS framework, integrating lidar point clouds and multi-view images, named LiDGS, which achieves high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction by introducing high-precision geometric a priori information and multiple geometric constraints from lidar point clouds, while guaranteeing efficient and accurate scene rendering. Specifically, we adopt an adaptive checkerboard sampling strategy and multi-hypothesis joint view selection (ACMP) for whole-image depth propagation, generating a high −precision dense depth map that provides continuous and accurate depth prior constraints for Gaussian optimization. Then, we design an adaptive Gaussian densification strategy, which effectively guides the geometric structure of the 3D scene through geometric anchors and adaptively adjusts the number and volume of Gaussians to more finely characterize the geometry of the object surface. Finally, this paper introduces a depth regularization method to correct the depth estimation of each Gaussian, ensuring the consistency of depth information from different viewpoints, which, in turn, improves the reconstruction quality. The experimental results show that the method achieves superior performance in both the new view synthesis task and the 3D reconstruction task, outperforming other classical methods.
