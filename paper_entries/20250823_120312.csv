10.1088/1748-9326/adc3ab,False,Environmental Research Letters,该论文主要研究干旱稀树草原中树木和草的共存动态，以及植被模式如何影响从稀树草原到草原的转变。论文构建了一个空间模型，考虑了树木对草的促进作用（通过遮荫）和草与树木对水分的竞争。研究结果表明，植被模式可以在一定程度上阻止或触发生态系统的突变。该研究与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系，主要关注生态系统内部的植物相互作用和空间格局。,[],Jelle van der Voort;Mara Baudena;Ehud Meron;Max Rietkerk;Arjen Doelman,Vegetation patterning can both impede and trigger critical transitions from savanna to grassland,"Tree-grass coexistence is a defining feature of savanna ecosystems, which play an important role in supporting biodiversity and human populations worldwide. While recent advances have clarified many of the underlying processes, how these mechanisms interact to shape ecosystem dynamics under environmental stress is not yet understood. Here, we present and analyse a minimalistic spatially extended model of tree-grass dynamics in dry savannas. We incorporate tree facilitation of grasses through shading and grass competing with trees for water, both varying with tree life stage. Our model shows that these mechanisms lead to grass-tree coexistence and bistability between savanna and grassland states. Moreover, the model predicts vegetation patterns consisting of trees and grasses, particularly under harsh environmental conditions, which can persist in situations where a non-spatial version of the model predicts ecosystem collapse from savanna to grassland instead (a phenomenon called ‘Turing-evades-tipping’). Additionally, we identify a novel ‘Turing-triggers-tipping’ mechanism, where unstable pattern formation drives tipping events that are overlooked when spatial dynamics are not included. These transient patterns act as early warning signals for ecosystem transitions, offering a critical window for intervention. Further theoretical and empirical research is needed to determine when spatial patterns prevent tipping or drive collapse."
10.1088/1748-9326/addedd,True,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文探讨了甲烷超级排放事件对空气质量、安全和公众健康的影响。它利用机载仪器和卫星观测数据估算甲烷排放率，并使用大气扩散模型（AERMOD）计算甲烷和非甲烷挥发性有机化合物（NMVOCs）的空气浓度。研究评估了甲烷和苯的浓度超过安全和健康标准的频率和范围，揭示了大型甲烷超级排放源对设施工人和附近社区的安全风险，以及对居民和敏感人群的健康风险。研究强调了控制甲烷超级排放源的重要性，并建议政策制定者在制定相关政策时，除了甲烷排放率之外，还应考虑气体成分等因素，以实现公共卫生和安全方面的最大协同效益。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它使用了卫星观测数据来量化甲烷排放，并结合大气扩散模型来评估空气质量影响。,"['methane emissions', 'NMVOCs', 'air quality', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric dispersion modeling', 'benzene', 'safety risks', 'health risks']",Sofia Bisogno;Chowdhury G Moniruzzaman;Nick Heath;Christos Efstathiou;Jeremy K Domen;Lee Ann L Hill;Jasmine Lee;Drew R Michanowicz;Quintin Munoz;Yanelli Nunez;Sebastian T Rowland;Daniel Bon;Daniel H Cusworth;Seth B C Shonkoff;Kelsey R Bilsback,Not just a climate problem: the safety and health risks of methane super-emitter events,"Methane super-emitter events (>100 kg methane hr−1) are prevalent across the oil and gas supply chain and are being targeted for methane mitigation policies due to their climate impacts; however, few studies have evaluated the air quality impacts and direct safety and public health risks. Here, we evaluate seven upstream oil and gas methane super-emitter events to examine the safety (explosivity) risks from methane and the short-term, noncancer health risks from benzene and other key co-emitted non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs). We used airborne instrument and satellite-measured methane emissions rates to estimate hourly air concentrations of methane using US EPA’s American Meteorological Society/Environmental Protection Agency Regulatory Model (AERMOD), a regulatory-grade dispersion model, and applied estimated speciated NMVOC-methane molar ratios to calculate hourly air concentrations of NMVOCs. We assessed when and where hourly modeled methane and NMVOC air concentrations exceeded national safety (0.5% methane) and state-based health (8 ppb and 53 ppb benzene) benchmarks. Large methane super-emitters (>2900 kg hr−1) had safety benchmark exceedances as far as 270 m from the source, indicating that safety risks are greatest for facility workers and nearby communities. Health benchmark exceedances were the greatest and most frequent close to the source (<300 m), but, in contrast to the safety risks, reached beyond one kilometer (1.1–19 km) for modeled methane super-emitters (210–15 800 kg hr−1), posing health risks to residents and sensitive populations. We also found that smaller methane super-emitters may pose outsized health risks: our second lowest methane emission case (539 kg hr−1) yielded the highest benzene air concentration (28 000 ppb), farthest 8 ppb benzene exceedance distance (19 km), and highest frequency of health benchmark exceedances between 1–5 km (2.6%). Our study demonstrates that policies and early detection efforts that control methane super-emitters should prioritize factors beyond methane emissions rate magnitude, such as gas composition, to provide the strongest co-benefits for public health and safety."

Sustainable nitrogen management requires cross-sectoral governance, but studies tracking nitrogen flows across sectors are limited. This study assesses cross-sectoral sources, flows, and sinks of reactive nitrogen (Nr) in Austria, identifying direct Nr inputs and emitting sectors. Using the ‘UNECE-Guidance Document on National Nitrogen Budgets’ and material flow analysis, we quantified Austria’s national nitrogen budget for 2015–2019. Results show the main nitrogen inflows and outflows from imports and exports in the consumer goods and chemical industries. Energy imports also contribute significantly. Some nitrogen is temporarily stored (e.g. in products) or transferred between sectors. However, not all of this N-loss is of direct environmental concern. Annually, 389 kt Nr are lost directly to the environment and causing significant environmental and economic consequences. Direct Nr inputs primarily originate from agriculture (39.3%) and energy/transport (20.7%), with around 30% from cross-border fluxes via water (13.9%) and air (16.6%). The remaining 10% stem from settlements, waste management, and industry. This study highlights the complexity of nitrogen sources and sinks in Austria and underscores the need for improvements towards reduced uncertainties in future research, including higher-resolution spatial data to account for regional variability."

In contrast to the TC bimodal structure in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) and its unimodal pattern in the Northwestern Pacific (WNP), the SCS exhibits a distinct step-like pattern with two jumps—the first occurring from April to May and the second from July to August, with the flat condition during May–June–July. Hence, TC in SCS witnesses the surprising transition between BoB and WNP. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, the genesis potential index is applied for a quantitative assessment of large-scale environmental factors. Results indicate that in the SCS, the mid-level atmospheric relative humidity is the dominant factor driving the first TC genesis jump in May, whereas the vertical wind shear contributes to the second jump. In the WNP, the mid-level atmospheric relative humidity remains the most crucial for TC peak feature. This study advances our understanding of the unique annual cycle of TC in the SCS in comparison with the neighboring BoB and NWP, offering valuable insights to improve the forecasting skills in the region."

In areas with a long history of human land-use, such as in Central Europe, few old-growth forests remain, located predominately in protected areas such as national parks and wilderness areas. Protected areas safeguard old-growth forests against human land use, but not against the impacts of anthropogenic climate change. Using simulation-based scenario analyses we here assessed the development of old-growth in the 21st century, using a national park in the Northern Alps as example. Under climate change, old-growth decreased by up to 21% relative to simulations under baseline climate, with decreasing size and cohesion of old-growth patches on the landscape. Climate-mediated increases in disturbance were driving the decline in old-growth forests, with a near complete loss in old-growth beyond disturbance rates of 1.5% yr−1. Conversely, structurally complex forests increased with disturbance, suggesting a decoupling of forest structure and demography in the 21st century. We conclude that climate change presents an indirect anthropogenic threat to old-growth forests in protected areas. Our findings highlight that climate impacts need to be considered explicitly in conservation planning, in order not to overestimate the effectiveness of protected areas."

Our paper aligns with and aims to contribute to emerging scholarship that questions these assumptions. Through a review of interdisciplinary just transition research, we map a distinction between mainstream, critical and reparative approaches to just transitions. Mainstream perspectives, largely rooted in the global north, focus on labour justice, while critical just transition scholarship addresses intersectional injustices and amplifies grassroots perspectives, particularly from the global south. Reparative approaches extend this critique by reckoning with the interconnected historical legacies of colonialism and industrial development, though empirical examples of this approach remain sparse. To differentiate these approaches, we introduce a 5R framework for just transitions—recognition, representation, redistribution, resurgence, and (settler) responsibility—foregrounding Indigenous resurgence as a crucial yet often overlooked element of repair. To illustrate this framework, we draw on a community-directed collaboration with the Tremembé da Barra do Mundaú Indigenous community in Ceará, Brazil. We conclude by inviting environmental and social scientists to consider more historically grounded and relationally reparative just transition approaches. Such approaches are essential, though not sufficient, for realizing the more transformative aims of just transitions."

The dynamics at these forest-savanna boundaries depend on their shapes, which influence the spread of fires through the savanna landscape. How these boundaries are shaped depends on tree recruitment patterns, which differ between trees dispersed by wind and those dispersed by birds. Therefore, tree dispersal modes may have large effects on fire spread and subsequently on forest-savanna resilience. To study these effects, we developed a novel individual-based model of seed dispersal in savanna-forest ecosystems, and investigated the interactions among tree seed dispersal modes, spatial patterns of tree cover, and fire spread. We study forest resilience by measuring the maximum loss of tree cover from which the forest can recover. We find that forest recruitment rate and resilience are more sensitive to forest pattern morphology when trees are dispersed by birds than by wind. In addition, these effects are more pronounced for larger forest patches that are spaced further apart. Moreover, recruitment and resilience in bird-dispersed forests display high sensitivity to bird behavioral parameters, suggesting that the community composition of frugivorous birds may be an important indirect driver of forest resilience. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that interactions between spatial patterns of tree cover and tree dispersal modes may affect the resilience of tropical forests and savannas against tipping. Thus, efforts to understand the impact of global change on tipping points between forest and savanna should account for the effects of seed dispersal modes."

The concepts of circularity and self-sufficiency are often put forward in assessments to complement indicators related to environmental impacts, such as nitrogen use efficiency, environmental N surplus, N losses. Here, we use these indicators to assess the environmental performance and sustainability of the agro-food systems of 127 regions in Europe in their current state as well as under two alternative scenarios of varying degrees of structural changes designed to reach sustainability. Both scenarios consider the projected European population at 2050, a dietary change toward less animal protein (30% and 20%, instead of 57% for the reference situation, Ref 2015–2019) and are based on the widespread use of organic crop rotations and the banning of synthetic fertilizers and feed imports. An Agro-Ecology scenario (AE) exploits crop and livestock production at optimal production capacity in the current agricultural areas of each region, thus maintaining the possibility of external trade, while a Radical Simplicity of lifestyle scenario (RS), limits production to regional requirements, with excess agricultural land set aside for reforestation and rewilding. AE and RS are able to feed Europe and greatly reduce environmental losses (more than 50% for both scenarios), but some not self-sufficient regions still necessitate interregional exchanges. Full circularity is theoretically not possible; it increases from 30% (Ref) to 43% (AE). At the European scale, N-food self-sufficiency remains over 1 (2.6 for Ref, 1.6–1.2 for AE and RS), while import dependency of European regions on commercial N-import for food delivery, currently over 2.7 as a mean, drops below 0.1 in both scenarios. The results illustrate the complex relationships between self-sufficiency, circularity, and the environmental impact of territorial agro-food systems."

The monitoring of vegetation greening is crucial for assessing ecosystem health, sustaining biodiversity, improving soil health, and providing direction for effective environmental management. However, long-term changes in greening trends are rarely reported due to radiometric inconsistencies among different satellite sensors. Here, we used 12 machine learning algorithms to perform pixel correction on 42 years of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and GIMMS NDVI data. The models exhibited high accuracy (93%–97%), yielding a robust ensemble R2 of 0.88 at the spatial scale. From 1982 to 2023, global NDVI had an increasing trend (0.0012), particularly in the high-latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere (>60° N), with the rate of increase accelerating since 2000. Temperature and water conditions showed significant correlations with greening trends, exhibiting spatially asymmetric effects. In addition, frequent land cover changes promoted the growth of greening trends (∼23%), which is linked to enhanced structural plasticity of vegetation. This effect has become more pronounced since 2000, with 92% of such changes occurring during this period. Anthropogenic impact may play a role in driving greening trend reductions, rather than enhancements."

However, the quantified influence of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and anthropogenic aerosols (AA) on HW days (HWD) and cumulative intensity (HWS) remains underexplored. Here, we investigated these influences based on a threshold adjustment method and optimal fingerprint method. Using observations from 1961–2020, we found that both HWD and HWS experienced a clear increase across most of China, with the largest changes centered in eastern and northwestern China. Bias-corrected Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) climate models successfully reproduced the observed changes as well as the regional differences. Anthropogenic forcing dominated by GHGs was robustly detected, with the influence of GHGs and AA successfully separated. Attribution analysis revealed that GHGs explained about 126.3% of HW changes. Constrained projections indicated that both HWD and HWS would continue to increase until 2050, even under the most optimistic low-emission scenario. Eastern China was projected to experience fast HW increase, likely due to intensified GHG emission combined with anticipated reduction in AA in the future, highlighting the urgency of developing mitigation and adaptation policies."

We find a global trend towards NOx-limited regimes supported by increasing satellite-based HCHO/NO2 ratio and a diminishing ozone weekend effect. 
 Ground-level ozone (O3) formation in urban areas is nonlinearly dependent on the relative availability of its precursors: oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). To mitigate O3 pollution, a crucial question is to identify the O3 formation regime (NOx-limited or VOC-limited). Here, we leverage ground-based O3 observations alongside space-based observations of O3 precursors, namely, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and formaldehyde (HCHO), to study the long-term shifts in O3 chemical regimes across global source regions. We first derive the regime threshold values for the satellite-derived HCHO/NO2 ratio by examining its relationship with the O3 weekend effect. We find that a regime transition from VOC-limited to NOx-limited occurs around 3.1 [2.7–3.4] for HCHO/NO2 with slight regional variations. By integrating data from four satellite instruments, including Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME), SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY), Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), we built a 27-year (1996–2022) satellite HCHO/NO2 record from which we assess the long-term trends in O3 production regimes. A discernible global trend towards NOx-limited regimes is evident, particularly in developed regions such as North America, Europe, and Japan, with emerging trends in developing countries like China and India over the past 2 decades. This shift is supported by both increasing HCHO/NO2 ratios and a diminishing O3 weekend effect. Yet, urban areas still hover in the VOC-limited and transitional regime on the basis of annual averages. Our findings stress the importance of adaptive emission control strategies to mitigate O3 pollution."

We integrated lidar and radiosonde observations to constrain the simulated aerosol profiles over North China and quantified the photochemical responses. The increased photolysis rates in the lower layers led to increased ozone and accounted for a 36 %–56 % reduction in API effects, resulting in enhanced atmospheric oxidizing capacity and aerosol formation. 
 The significance of aerosol–photolysis interaction (API) in atmospheric photochemistry has been emphasized by studies utilizing box models and chemical transport models. However, few studies have considered the actual aerosol vertical distribution when evaluating API effects due to the lack of observations and the uncertainties in model simulation. Herein, we integrated lidar and radiosonde observations with the chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) to quantify the response of photochemistry to observational constraints on aerosol vertical distribution across different seasons in North China. The underestimation of aerosol optical depth (AOD) in lower layers and the overestimation in upper layers in GEOS-Chem model were revised. In response, photolysis rates changed following AOD, showing 33.4 %–73.8 % increases at the surface. Surface ozone increased by an average of 0.9 and 0.5 ppb in winter and summer, and the default API impact on ozone reduced by 36 %–56 %. The weaker response in summer can be related to the compensatory effects of stronger turbulence mixing in the boundary layer. The long-lasting underestimation of ozone levels in winter was also greatly improved. Due to the enhanced photochemistry, PM2.5 increased by 0.8 µg m−3 in winter and 0.2 µg m−3 in summer and increased strongly during pollution events, with a maximum daily change of 16.5 µg m−3 at Beijing station in winter. The weakened API effect in turn enhanced nitric acid formation by increasing atmospheric oxidizing capacity (13.5 % increase for OH radical) in high NOx emission areas, and this helps explain the strong response of PM2.5 in winter."

In this work, we use lab-based experiments to identify the main breakdown routes of these compounds in the atmosphere. We have determined that they likely contribute less to air pollution than the compounds that they replace. 
 Laboratory-based experiments were used to investigate the atmospheric degradation chemistry of two oxymethylene ethers, CH3O(CH2O)3CH3 (OME3) and CH3O(CH2O)4CH3 (OME4). OME3 and OME4 have been proposed as promising “green” replacement compounds for problematic ethereal solvents such as 1,4-dioxane and tetrahydrofuran. Results from direct, absolute laser-based experiments and from a series of complementary relative rate studies demonstrated that OH + OME3 proceeded with a rate coefficient k3(296 ± 2 K) = (1.0 ± 0.2) × 10−11 cm3 molec.−1 s−1, a factor of 2 smaller than predicted by structure activity relationships (SARs). Evidence for a complex mechanism was provided by k3(294–464 K), characterised by deviations from Arrhenius-like behaviour close to room temperature. A further series of relative rate experiments were used to determine a rate coefficient of k4(296 ± 2 K) = (1.1 ± 0.4) × 10−11 cm3 molec.−1 s−1 for OH + OME4. These results allowed for lifetimes, τ≈1 d, to be estimated for the removal of each of OME3 and OME4 from the troposphere. The photochemical ozone creation potential estimate (POCPE) was calculated for northwest Europe conditions. These were considerably smaller than equivalent metrics for the problematic solvents they may replace, largely owing to their lack of C–C bonds. In the course of this work, rate coefficients (in 10−11 cm3 molec.−1 s−1) were determined for Cl + OME3, k6(296 ± 2 K) = (17 ± 4), and for Cl + OME4, k7(296 ± 2 K) = (19 ± 6)."

The used methodology obviates the need for exhaustive earthquake re-evaluation, and it is particularly effective for the updating of medium and low events, with a large amount of low-intensity data. The result is a new dataset very useful in improving “seismic histories” and in contributing to the enhancement of the seismic hazard of an area. 
 Each Italian earthquake included in the Italian Parametric Catalogue (CPTI) is based on a single study, with its database stored in the Italian Macroseismic Database (DBMI). The DBMI contains macroseismic-intensity data for approximately 5000 Italian earthquakes. However, for the same events, numerous studies have been independently carried out over the years, with the data of such studies not having been incorporated into the DBMI. By consolidating all available data for each event, it is possible to significantly enhance the dataset used for hazard assessments and the reconstruction of local seismic histories. This approach would make studies of individual events much more robust and comprehensive. The objective of this work is to propose the integration of different macroseismic datasets for individual events by identifying criteria that can effectively merge a large number of intensity data points.A total of 45 Italian earthquakes with data from multiple sources were identified and reassessed through a rapid review process. This effort has resulted in the creation of a new dataset (https://doi.org/10.13127/macroseismic/teral024, Tertulliani et al., 2024), substantially increasing the number of macroseismic data points (MDPs) for the earthquakes covered by this study compared to in the DBMI15 (from 2892 to 9328 MDPs). Consequently, the macroseismic distributions for these 45 events have become more detailed, robust, and extensive."

Such knowledge- and data-driven models aim to reduce the large uncertainty in estimating gross primary productivity (GPP). 
 Accurately estimating gross primary productivity (GPP) in terrestrial ecosystems is essential for understanding the global carbon cycle. Satellite-based light use efficiency (LUE) models are commonly employed for simulating GPP. However, the variables and algorithms related to environmental limiting factors differ significantly across various LUE models, leading to high uncertainty in GPP estimation. In this work, we developed a series of FLAML-LUE models with different variable combinations. These models utilize the Fast Lightweight Automated Machine Learning (FLAML) framework, using variables of LUE models, to investigate the potential of estimating site-scale GPP. Incorporating meteorological data, eddy covariance measurements, and remote sensing indices, we employed FLAML-LUE models to assess the impact of various variable combinations on GPP across different temporal scales, including daily, 8 d, 16 d, and monthly intervals. Cross-validation analyses indicated that the FLAML-LUE model performs excellently in GPP prediction, accurately simulating both its temporal variations and magnitude, particularly in mixed forests and coniferous forests, with average R2 values for daily-scale simulations reaching 0.92 and 0.91, respectively. However, the model performed less effectively in alpine shrubland and typical grassland ecosystems, though it still outperformed both MODIS GPP and PML GPP in terms of performance. Furthermore, the model's adaptability under extreme climate conditions was evaluated, and the results showed that high temperatures and high vapor pressure deficit (VPD) lead to a slight decrease in model accuracy, though R2 remains around 0.8. Under drought conditions, the model's performance improved slightly in croplands and evergreen broadleaf forests, although it declined at some sites. This study offers an approach to estimate GPP fluxes and evaluate the impact of variables on GPP estimation. It has the potential to be applied in predicting GPP for different vegetation types at a regional scale."

We investigated 13 on-the-market drinking straws of varying formulations, characterizing their physical, chemical, and marine biodegradation properties. These data informed sustainability metrics used for evaluating the effectiveness and trade-offs of design strategies, ultimately arriving at four key conclusions. First, diverting anthropogenic methane as an alternative feedstock to make polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) resulted in the only straw with a net-negative global warming potential. Second, adding biogenic fillers to conventional polymers (e.g., polypropylene) to minimize plastic usage is unlikely to produce substantial environmental benefits compared to using alternative polymers. Third, many marketing claims about circularity, sustainability, and persistence were unsupported, likely magnifying the mismanagement and environmental impacts of these products. Fourth, improper disposal of compostable straws in landfills could increase the global warming potential of the item by up to 6 times and offset numerous advantages afforded by biodegradable materials, thereby warranting greater investment in waste management infrastructure. The analysis of design strategies and their trade-offs provided herein should be applied broadly when developing and adopting future consumer products."

PBDEs disrupt neurodevelopment, but their long-term effects and the influence of exposure route remain poorly understood. Using Fundulus heteroclitus (mummichogs), we tested whether early life exposure to BDE-99, a prevalent PBDE, leads to persistent behavioral and molecular alterations and whether outcomes differ between progenitor (maternal) exposure and direct embryonic exposure. Both approaches achieved comparable doses and were followed by rearing in clean water until adulthood. Both exposure routes resulted in long-term hyperactivity and reduced anxiety-like behavior, though effects varied by dose and sex. Progenitor exposure altered behavior and the brain transcriptome in F1 males (females not tested), whereas direct embryonic exposure affected females and not males. These findings suggest maternal factors, such as metabolites, lipid provisioning, small molecules, and epigenetic imprinting, play a key role in modulating developmental outcomes. Our results demonstrate that exposure route significantly influences long-term toxicity and highlight the importance of considering maternal contributions when assessing risks from persistent pollutants. Given that maternal and environmental exposures co-occur in nature, integrated assessments are critical for understanding real-world impacts of persistent pollutants on marine life."

This study demonstrates the strengths of calcein AM, a highly sensitive fluorescent stain for esterase activity, in an automated image-based multiwell plate assay for detecting sublethal effects in Daphnia magna. Sample processing and feeding conditions were optimized to ensure a uniform dye distribution. The protocol was validated using two esterase inhibitors, triphenyl phosphate and netilmicin sulfate, and subsequently applied to test the environmental contaminants methoxychlor, lindane, tributyltin chloride, pentachlorophenol, diuron, and ethofumesate. The test organisms were imaged in vivo using automated confocal microscopy, and fluorescence intensity was quantified to generate concentration–response curves. The effects of triphenyl phosphate and netilmicin sulfate were observed at concentrations 3-fold and 6-fold lower, respectively, than in the OECD 202 immobilization test. All tested contaminants also inhibited esterase activity, with concentrations resulting in no esterase activity at 48 h, correlating with mortality observed at 48 h.

Consequently, WWTPs emit greenhouse gases (GHGs), including methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). However, large uncertainties remain, as direct measurements of WWTP emissions have been challenging, and emission estimates frequently depend on uncertain emission factors and activity data. Using drone-based measurements, we here show that the combined CO2-equivalent emissions of CH4 and N2O from WWTPs with anaerobic digestion (AD) and sludge storage were 2.4-fold higher than IPCC-recommended emission-factor-based estimates. N2O emissions from sludge, presently assumed to be zero, were 9% of the CH4 emissions by weight and contributed to half of the total CO2-equivalent sludge emissions. Hence, with the necessary increase in AD in WWTPs to recover energy and reduce fossil fuel use, emission mitigation is needed, and adequate tools facilitating flux observations by WWTP managers are key for setting effective mitigation priorities."

Compaction is a pivotal event in the morula stage of preimplantation development. This study established a phenotypic screening platform using circularity of morula-like aggregates derived from mouse expanded pluripotent stem cells to screen PFAS that may disrupt compaction. Among the 19 tested PFAS, five were identified to be positive hits, and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) showed the most pronounced effect. PFOA inhibited the expression of adhesion molecules and disrupted the cell polarity in morula-like aggregates at 100 nM, and it reduced the proportion of high-quality aggregates at 10 nM. Similar effects were observed in mouse embryos. Mechanistically, PFOA interfered with c-MYC/MAX complex formation with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 22.3 μM, and inhibited its transcriptional activity with the lowest effective concentration of 40 μM, comparable to that of the commercial inhibitor 10074-G5. c-MYC overexpression rescued PFOA-induced damage in morula-like aggregates. The c-MYC inhibitor 10074-G5 impaired cell adhesion and polarization in both morula-like aggregates at 1000 nM and mouse embryos at 5 μM.

While cutting land-derived nutrient sources has been proposed as the key solution, its effectiveness may be undermined by climate change, and costs may rise after addressing the easier targets. Evaluating various nutrient measures under future climate scenarios is critical but challenging due to inadequate projections for coastal processes. In this global context, we combine field measurements with a coast-resolved physical-biogeochemical model to assess the effectiveness of land-based and alternative mitigation strategies under near-term (2016–2045) and long-term (2071–2100) climate change scenarios in a representative estuary-shelf system. Our findings evidence that stringent land-based nutrient reduction is necessary but insufficient to halt deoxygenation under climate change. This insufficiency is mainly due to enhanced water-column stratification, driven by climate warming and its associated increase in river discharge, which restricts oxygen replenishment more than the reductions in biogeochemical oxygen consumption achieved through nutrient management. We demonstrate that oyster aquaculture can serve as an effective complementary strategy to remove nutrients and combat oxygen depletion. This incentivizing approach aligns with the global trend of increasing nonfed aquaculture, offering a promising supplementary solution to the challenges of managing coastal nutrients and mitigating hypoxia globally."

However, the impacts of MPs-DOM, especially at environmentally relevant concentrations, on soil DOM dynamics remain unclear. Here, we examined DOM transformation in yellow (YS) and black (BS) soils upon the addition of MPs-DOM, leached from biodegradable and nonbiodegradable mulches under ultraviolet irradiation (UV-MPs-DOM) and dark conditions (D-MPs-DOM), at environmentally relevant concentrations (3 mg C/kg). Results showed that extraction conditions, rather than mulch type, predominantly affected the bioavailability of MPs-DOM. UV-MPs-DOM, enriched in lipid-like and protein/amino sugar–like compounds, promoted soil DOM transformation. In YS, characterized by lower microbial diversity, UV-MPs-DOM enhanced DOM lability more than D-MPs-DOM. Conversely, in BS, with a diverse microbial community, UV-MPs-DOM with high bioavailability not only directly altered soil DOM composition but also was rapidly metabolized by the soil microbiome, particularly Proteobacteria, thereby resulting in increased soil DOM recalcitrance. However, the low bioavailability of D-MPs-DOM primarily exerted direct effects, contributing to its accumulation and increase in soil DOM lability. These findings provide novel evidence that MPs-DOM at environmentally relevant concentrations can alter soil DOM through distinct pathways, highlighting its potential long-term ecological risks."

Despite its harmful effects, effective strategies for mitigating PFOS-induced toxicity remain undeveloped or at best underdeveloped. In this effort, we explore the concept of toxicity reversal by loci-specific DNA methylation editing to reverse PFOS-induced toxicity, whereby key cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and apoptosis are restored. To demonstrate our concept, we employed CRISPR-dCas9 epigenome editing tools, utilizing catalytically deactivated Cas9 fused with either DNA methyltransferases or ten-eleven translocation (TET) dioxygenase effectors for loci-specific epigenome editing. Gene expression changes related to kidney disease, metabolism, and DNA methylation pathways were first noted. Through reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), we demonstrated how PFOS exposure disrupts the epigenetic landscape, altering transcription factor binding sites linked to tumorigenesis, inflammation, and stress. By methylation editing of a single CpG site in implicated genes such as TARS2 and MAP2K5, we effectively reversed PFAS-induced toxicity and restored essential cell functions. Our success in precise single-CpG methylation editing of target genes effectively reverses toxicity, marking the first application of epigenome editing tools to counteract the toxic effects of a persistent environmental contaminant (PFAS).

Here we present observations of enhanced backscattering in seismic data collected above terrestrial lava tubes. We show that the spatial and frequency characteristics of wavefield intensity can be related to the dimensions of the lava tubes. Our findings suggest that, when geological indicators such as collapse pits are present, this method would enable mapping lava tubes on Earth and, by proxy, on the Moon and Mars, and that the approach is readily adaptable for future planetary exploration."

However, whether a spatial cascading link exists within the hydrological cycle remains poorly understood. Using satellite‐based precipitation, soil moisture (SM), and vegetation products during 2016–2023, we quantify and compare their spatial scales, defined as the distance over which a variable maintains similar temporal variations, across Africa. Results show spatial scales increase sequentially from precipitation to SM to vegetation. Spatial scales diverge from precipitation to the land surface, with precipitation scales having a weak positive correlation with SM scales and moderately negatively correlated with vegetation scales. Soil moisture and vegetation scales remain positively coupled. Regional analyses reveal stronger scale coupling in semi‐arid regions. Seasonally, precipitation–soil moisture scale correlation intensifies from onset to peak of the rainy season across all unimodal regimes, whereas SM‐vegetation scale coupling weakens slightly.

In all cases, titanomagnetite is thermodynamically stable at pre‐eruptive storage conditions and magnetic susceptibility (χLF) is independent of vesicularity and permeability, indicating that crystals likely formed prior to vesiculation.

Recent advances in the optical modeling of nonspherical mineral dust particles make possible more subtle interpretation of the top‐of‐atmosphere radiances acquired by the NASA Earth Observing System's Multi‐angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument. We confirm the MISR radiometrically retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD), its spectral dependence, and geometrically retrieved plume height by comparison with published results from other space‐ and surface‐based instruments. But in addition, we use the advanced MISR Research Aerosol retrieval algorithm to produce for the first time a history of changing column‐effective coarse‐mode size and light‐absorption for nonspherical dust particles during transit. Although the absolute numerical values of particle microphysical properties obtained from remote sensing tend to be qualitative, the stability of the MISR instrument, the dominance of the dust column optical depth contribution throughout the transit in this case, and the darkness and relative uniformity of the underlying ocean surface lend confidence to the retrieved trends and timescales, though plume heterogeneity, cloud contamination, and in one case sun glint contribute some additional uncertainty to the results.

In this study, we optimize the algorithm for detecting blowing snow from NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat‐2) satellite for use over Arctic sea ice. We analyze six months (November 2019 through April 2020) of observations from the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) campaign together with 612 nearly coincident (within 100 km) ICESat‐2 overpasses to evaluate the ICESat‐2 detection algorithm and inferred blowing snow properties. Both ICESat‐2 and MOSAiC suggest a blowing snow occurrence frequency of 17% during the period of study. Blowing snow particle number and inferred from ICESat‐2 show broad agreement with in situ observations made at 10 m above the surface during MOSAiC but are often well below observations made at 8 cm. Within a 100 km radius around the MOSAiC observatory, we find a cumulative blowing snow sublimation of 2.38 cm snow‐water‐equivalent (SWE), comparable to MOSAiC (2.56 cm SWE) and SnowModel‐LG (2.35 cm SWE) estimates. This suggests that blowing snow sublimation removed 22%–33% of snowfall during MOSAiC. Across the central Arctic, ICESat‐2 and SnowModel‐LG indicate blowing snow occurrence frequencies as high as 18%–25%, with cumulative blowing snow sublimation fluxes (1.74–1.79 cm SWE) removing 16%–17% of snowfall.

Various studies report both ongoing and projected reductions in AMOC strength, with important implications for climate and society. While Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI) has been proposed to mitigate some impacts of a warming climate, model simulations disagree whether it could also be successful in ameliorating the projected AMOC decline. Using idealized SAI sensitivity simulations with the Community Earth System Model, we demonstrate that whether SAI could restore AMOC depends on the details of SAI implementation, particularly its latitude(s). Specifically, Northern‐hemispheric SAI initially impacts upper‐ocean densities in the North Atlantic through changes in surface heat flux and temperature, ultimately preventing AMOC decline. On the other hand, Southern‐hemispheric SAI does not substantially impact AMOC strength even though global mean cooling is achieved. We show that different processes play different roles in determining the AMOC response between the initial (∼10–15 years) and longer timescales, with the former dominated by the direct SAI effect and the latter influenced by feedbacks from AMOC adjustments. These processes may also offset each other, leading to a relatively stable evolution of AMOC under each SAI realization and a small, yet substantially different, subset of potential AMOC responses. Our results demonstrate the potential for SAI to help avoid some climatic tipping points, but also highlight the need to understand the dependence of the outcomes on the specifics of SAI as well as for a better process‐based understanding of the many factors influencing such outcomes."

 Long-term historical records of glacier mass change are key to advancing understanding of glaciers’ response to climate change and improving predictions of their future. Here, we use historical aerial photographs and new bed topography measurements to provide an 85-year record of glacier change on Kennicott and Root Glaciers in Alaska. At the glacier terminus, little change is observed in the two decades prior to 1957, followed by ongoing and accelerating mass loss with dynamically driven spatial variability. Glacier projections, constrained by these mass loss estimates, predict that Kennicott Glacier will lose 38 ± 14% to 63 ± 18% of its mass by 2100, relative to 2000, and Root Glacier will lose 38 ± 11% to 58 ± 12%, depending on the emissions scenario. These results differ by up to 22% from similar predictions made by projections calibrated from the past two decades of glacier change only. This highlights the importance of long-term glacier mass-loss records that help us better project far-reaching consequences of climate change related to sea level rise, water resources, natural hazards, climate, and culture.

In the presence of an external rotating magnetic field, the developed AR are capable of moving controllably and wirelessly, and efficiently scavenging inflammatory factors and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus due to the existing receptors from the cell membrane cloaking strategy, thereby inhibiting the virus invasion and reducing the damage of inflammation to the lungs. Due to the active movement, AR significantly increase and prolong the accumulation of Cur in the lungs in vivo, thus alleviating the pneumonia and regulating pneumonia microenvironment.

 Mantle plumes, the hot upwellings from the Earth’s core-mantle boundary, are thought to trigger surface uplift and the emplacement of large igneous provinces (LIPs). Magmatic centres of many LIPs are scattered over thousands of kilometres. This has been attributed to lateral flow of plume material into thin-lithosphere areas, but evidence for such flow is scarce. Here, we use abundant seismic data and recently developed methods of seismic thermography to map previously unknown plate-thickness variations in the Britain-Ireland part of the North Atlantic Igneous Province, linked to the Iceland Plume. The locations of the  ~ 60 Myr old uplift and magmatism are systematically where the lithosphere is anomalously thin at present. The dramatic correlation indicates that the hot Iceland Plume material reached this region and eroded its lithosphere, with the thin lithosphere, hot asthenosphere and its decompression melting causing the uplift and magmatism. We demonstrate, further, that the unevenly distributed current intraplate seismicity in Britain and Ireland is also localised in the thin-lithosphere areas and along lithosphere-thickness contrasts. The deep-mantle plume has created not only a pattern of thin-lithosphere areas and scattered magmatic centres but, also, lasting mechanical heterogeneity of the lithosphere that controls long-term distributions of deformation, earthquakes and seismic hazard.

Here, the authors use machine learning, high-throughput screening and statistical physics to explore large neutral space of catalytic RNAs. 
 Estimating the plausibility of RNA self-reproduction is central to origin-of-life scenarios. However, this property has been shown in only a handful of catalytic RNAs. Here, we compare models for their generative power in diversifying a reference ribozyme, based on statistical covariation and secondary structure prediction, and experimentally test model predictions using high-throughput sequencing. Leveraging statistical physics methods, we compute the number of ribozymes capable of autocatalytic self-reproduction from oligonucleotide fragments to be over 1039, with sequences found up to 65 mutations from the original sequence and 99 mutations away from each other, far beyond the 10 mutations achieved by deep mutational scanning. The findings demonstrate an efficient method for exploring RNA sequence space, and provide quantitative data on self-reproducing RNA that further illuminates the potential pathways to abiogenesis.

Here, the authors show that affective error signals (emotional surprise) independently promote learning, and are associated with neural signals separable from reward error signals. 
 Reinforcement learning models focus on reward prediction errors as the driver of behavior. However, recent evidence indicates that deviations from emotion expectations, termed affective prediction errors, also crucially shape behavior. Whether there is neural separability between emotion and reward signals remains unknown. We employ electroencephalography during social learning to investigate the neural signatures of reward and affective prediction errors. Behavioral results reveal that affective prediction errors are associated with choices when little is known about how a partner will behave. This behavioral evidence is mirrored neurally by engagement of separate event-related potentials. More specifically, the feedback-related negativity is largely and consistently indexed by reward prediction errors, while the P3b is more consistently tracked by affective prediction errors. The P3b in particular is linked to subsequent choices, highlighting the mechanistic influence of emotion during social learning. These findings present evidence for a neurobiologically viable emotion learning signal that is partially distinguishable, at both the behavior and neural levels, from reward. Previous research shows surprising rewards drive learning. Here, the authors show that affective error signals (emotional surprise) independently promote learning, and are associated with neural signals separable from reward error signals."

 Millions of lives are lost due to air pollution, underscoring the urgent need to understand the factors that influence air quality. Here, we employ a multidisciplinary approach, integrating media data analysis, behavioral experiments, and agent-based modeling to explore the impact of inaccurate air quality reports on travel behavior and actual air quality. Media analysis reveals a negative correlation between the accuracy of air pollution reports and the air quality index. Behavioral experiments demonstrate that media reports inaccurately showing good air quality reduce individuals’ perceived pollution levels, which in turn leads to increased travel behavior. Furthermore, agent-based modeling simulations show that individual changes in travel behavior can collectively lead to increased air pollutant emissions and deteriorated overall air quality.

 Ditches (linear constructions which store and/or move water where humans prefer it to go), via irrigation, drainage, and power, have helped drive the development of human societies. Now, ditches and other linear channels, typically carrying water, are numerous and found on every continent. Their form varies widely with use, which includes land drainage, irrigation, transportation, and boundary marking. Ditches support and shape biogeochemical cycles, biotic communities, and human societies, at multiple spatiotemporal scales. However, ditches are frequently overlooked by researchers in many disciplines. Here, we review the largely unrecognized role that ditches play in environmental processes and human societies. The effects of ditches can be both positive (e.g., biodiversity refuges, water for food production, nutrient retention) and negative (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions, dispersal of pollutants). We call for future management to consider and enhance the multifunctional role that ditches can deliver at the landscape-scale.

 The accelerating melt of the Greenland Ice Sheet is releasing large volumes of freshwater into the coastal ocean, diluting seawater alkalinity. Biogeochemical processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, and sediment mineral dissolution also shape carbon dynamics in these freshened waters, but their combined influence on the ocean’s carbon pump remains unresolved. Here we isolate the chemical effects of meltwater dilution through a controlled seawater-freshwater mixing experiment, providing empirical evidence for nonlinear reduction in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2). Carbonate system modeling revealed the mechanisms behind this nonlinearity, helping to explain 17 years of low pCO2 in a Greenlandic fjord. Sensitivity analysis shows that the influence of biogeochemical processes is fundamentally shaped by the chemical environment in which they operate. Freshwater input reduces buffering capacity and therefore amplifies the system’s sensitivity to biological activity and acidification.

 Longstanding theories and models classify mineral-associated organic matter as the large ( ~ 60%) but slow-cycling and persistent portion of soil organic matter. Strong physico-chemical interactions and diffusion limitations restrict the turnover of mineral-associated organic matter, allowing carbon and nitrogen bound therein to persist in soil for as long as centuries to millennia. However, mineral-associated organic matter is a chemically and functionally diverse pool with a substantial portion cycling at relatively fast (i.e., minutes to years) timescales. Despite a growing body of evidence for the heterogenous and multi-pool nature of mineral-associated organic matter, we lack consensus on how to conceptualize and directly quantify fast-cycling mineral-associated organic matter and its ecological significance. We demonstrate that the dynamic qualities of fast-cycling mineral-associated organic matter vary based on 1) the chemistry of the mineral particles and organic matter, 2) the complex set of interactions between organic matter and the mineral matrix, and 3) the presence and strength of destabilizing forces that lead to decomposition or loss of mineral-associated organic matter (i.e., plant-microbe interactions, agricultural intensification, and climate change). Finally, we discuss potential implications and research opportunities for how we measure, manage, and model the dynamic subfraction of this otherwise persistent pool of soil organic matter.

 River floods that exceed historical records often occur unexpectedly, causing widespread damage and disruption. To improve disaster preparedness, it is crucial to explore exceptional flood scenarios that surpass past observations. Here we introduce a perfect storm approach that recombines historically observed extremes in precipitation and soil moisture to generate plausible flood scenarios that are easy to understand by lay people and flood risk managers. Our analysis covers the ten most damaging floods recorded in Germany, two additional extreme precipitation events and two cases of exceptionally wet soil moisture conditions. The results show that the severity and damage of these recombined floods can systematically exceed those of the observed events, demonstrating the potential of the perfect storm approach to generate plausible scenarios of unprecedented floods. While shifting extreme rainfall to wetter soil consistently amplifies flood severity, moving events by just 1 month can also intensify flooding, which underscores the critical role of temporal alignment between catchment state and precipitation. Our study enables planners and policymakers to anticipate extreme flood scenarios beyond historical precedents, and offers a simple, yet powerful, strategy for obtaining flood scenarios to enhance disaster preparedness.

 Emperor penguins serve as early-warning sentinels for the Antarctic ecosystem and climate change. Understanding how climate change influences their habitat use offers insights into the fragile polar ecosystem for supporting the climate actions under the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, it remains unclear how the gradual climate change and extreme climatic events affect the dispersal of emperor penguin breeding habitats due to the lack of a systematic and long-term dataset documenting their habitat use. Here, we first develop guano indices and present an automated approach to map emperor penguin breeding habitats at 30-m spatial resolution using Earth observation satellite imagery, achieving a user accuracy of 94.8 %. We further reveal that habitat dispersal is sensitive to four extreme events—heat, blizzard, storm, and low sea ice. Specifically, colonies exposed to intense climate extremes generally exhibit more fragmented distributions, with habitat reuse periods mostly under 3 years and interannual habitat dispersal exceeding 4 km. These four extreme events together explained 21 %–72 % of the variability in annual habitat dispersal. Under a high-emission scenario driven by fossil fuels, the warming-induced annual fragmentation of habitats is projected to be 255 m greater than that under a low-emission scenario using clean energy, leading to higher vulnerability in emperor penguins by disrupting their ability to survive and reproduce. The proposed method enables routine mapping and updating of emperor penguin breeding habitats, and the associated findings demonstrate that extreme climatic events significantly impact habitat use and dispersal patterns, highlighting the urgent need for global climate policies aligned with sustainable development to protect the Antarctic ecosystem."

 Monitoring surface deformation is critical for understanding and mitigating natural and anthropogenic hazards, such as landslides and subsidence. Although Multi-Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) provides detailed displacement measurements, its application in continuous monitoring remains constrained by high computational demands and complex data processing, often interrupting observation continuity. To address these challenges, this study proposes a deep learning-based method that processes wrapped Differential InSAR (D-InSAR) interferograms to directly detect surface deformation patterns. A Fringe-Labeling Model (FLM) was developed to identify deformation regions, followed by a Fringe-Detection Model (FDM) using Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (Faster R-CNN) to classify deformation magnitudes. The method achieved an average mean Average Precision (mAP) of 83.9% in Central Taiwan. Temporal transferability was validated by detecting deformation one year beyond the original MT-InSAR observation period. Spatial transferability was confirmed by applying the model to Northern Taiwan, where an F1 score of 78.74% was achieved while effectively identifying both uplift and subsidence.

 BackgroundParticulate matter (PM10/2.5) is a ubiquitous air pollutant with detrimental health impacts where fine particles (PM2.5) are posing serious threats to respiratory health. With potentially worse outcomes, it is silently damaging the lungs of people already suffering from respiratory diseases like asthma. The continuous exposures to poor air quality in recent years raises urgent questions for both, immediate and long-term health impacts. Both PM10/2.5 levels have surpassed the Indian National safety standards raising serious concerns about the environmental and health consequences.MethodologyThis study aimed to investigate impact of PM10/2.5 exposures on mice lungs where pathological changes in OVA-induced asthmatic mice lungs were compared with normal mice lungs. BALB/c mice were sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA, i.p), followed by OVA aerosol (1 %OVA) challenge, and later subjected to PM10/2.5 exposures (0.5 mg/kg, i.n) continuously for five consecutive days. Lung samples were assessed for oxidative stress markers (ROS and lipid peroxidation), inflammatory mediators (nitric oxide, histamine, myeloperoxidase, eosinophil peroxidase, IL-6), fibrotic markers (collagen deposition, MMP-9 activity, α-SMA expression), and histopathological changes. Dose-dependent cytotoxicity, oxidative stress induced DNA damage in human alveolar epithelial cells (A549) after PM10/2.5 exposures were thoroughly investigated. Curcumin derived from turmeric (Curcuma longa) is known anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory molecule, was studied for its therapeutic efficacy on PM-induced asthma aggravations and fibrotic changes.Key findingsSignificant lung damage was noted after short-term PM10/2.5 exposures (5 days) with aggravated inflammatory and fibrotic changes in both, normal and asthmatic mice lungs, where PM2.5 exposure was severe. Significant morphological and histopathological changes like lung tissue remodeling, epithelial thickening, and collagen deposition was observed. Enhanced immune cell recruitment, ROS and MDA levels along with significantly decreased key antioxidant enzymes, Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Catalase, compared to the control group were noted with reduced GSH level. Upregulated expression of NF-kB, a transcription factor after PM10/2.5 exposure was found in normal mice which was heightened in asthmatic mice. Enhanced MMP-9 activity was also confirmed by immunofluorescent detection of Alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Curcumin, a plant-derived molecule, significantly mitigated PM2.5 exposed airway inflammation and fibrotic changes in lungs by suppressing NF-κB expression and enhancing Nrf2 level. In vitro studies validated these findings, where dose-dependent decrease in cell viability and increased in ROS level along with apoptotic changes A549 cells were observed after PM exposure. Enhanced IL-6 and PARP-1 expression confirmed progressive PM2.5 exposure induced cytotoxicity in A549 cells which was reduced after curcumin treatment.SignificanceThese findings draw the attention towards detrimental impacts of poor air quality of Varanasi city with genotoxic effects which have not been reported before. Therapeutic potential of Curcumin as a natural protective agent against PM-induced respiratory damage revealed antioxidant-based interventions. It may be alarming for residents living in such polluted environments, particularly susceptible asthmatic population where silent pathological changes are in progress, thus, more detailed investigations are required along with improved air quality management policies in polluted urban areas in near future."

 Based on the Climate Research Unit (CRU) monthly rainfall data and the NationalCenters for Environment Prediction (NCEP)/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) reanalysis atmospheric circulation data during 1961–2020, we examine the interdecadal change in the relationship between the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and summer rainfall in northern Central Asia (CA). Results show that the NAO negatively (positively) correlates with summer rainfall in northern CA during 1969–1989 (1990–2010), but it becomes obviously closer in the second period, indicating their relationship has experienced a significant interdecadal change over the past 60 years. The varying relationship between the NAO and summer rainfall in northern CA is caused by the interdecadal change in the NAO-related large-scale circulation anomalies. The positive NAOI is well related to the strengthening subtropical westerly jet over CA, an anomalous cyclone over west of CA and southerly wind prevailing over northern CA and convergences of water vapor occupying the whole northern CA, so the relationship between the NAO and summer rainfall in northern CA has become stronger during 1990–2010. Furthermore analysis suggests that the intensity of subtropical westerly jet over CA plays an important role in linking the NAO and summer rainfall in northern CA. In the first period, the atmospheric teleconnection pattern triggered by the NAO only has weak effects on the subtropical westerly jet over CA, but in the second period it can strongly modulate the change in the intensity of subtropical westerly jet over CA."

Given that the intervillous flow cannot be resolved by clinical imaging, theoretical models are used to study the flow dynamics in the intervillous space (IVS). We propose an experimental method to visualize the flow within the IVS of a single placental cotyledon postpartum. At first, a cotyledon is measured by micro-computed tomography imaging. The reconstructed volume is then used to create a near-realistic placenta model. Four variations of arterial inlets are designed to simulate both normal and abnormal flow patterns. A scaled version of the model is printed in three dimensions. Magnetic resonance imaging–based velocity measurements inside the printed model, which is perfused with a Newtonian fluid at two Reynolds numbers, revealed that the flow patterns are primarily influenced by the Reynolds number and the dilation of the arterial inlet.

We analyze >20,000 impulsive events from the 2015 Axial Seamount eruption and find that their seismo-acoustic waveform characteristics suggest an implosive source mechanism. Integrating constraints from their spatiotemporal evolution with heat transfer estimates and geological observations, we propose that while the largest events might be related to volatiles degassed from magma, most events are generated by the implosion of bubbles formed from the vaporization of entrapped seawater by hot erupted lava. Similar events have been detected at other seamounts and slow to fast-spreading mid-ocean ridges, although eruptions at >3000-meter depth have proportionately fewer events because seawater vaporization is inhibited. Therefore, these impulsive seafloor events can be leveraged to remotely characterize eruption dynamics in most submarine volcanic settings."

We identified alteredSFPQsplicing in ALS, increasing the expression of an alternative mRNA isoform lacking a nuclear localization sequence, which we termed “altSFPQ.” We find thataltSFPQmRNA contributes to SFPQ autoregulation and is highly unstable yet exhibits context-specific translation with cytoplasm-predominant localization.

Here, we perform operando superfluid density measurements on ion-gated FeSe films. We observe a synchronized evolution of the superconducting condensate and the strange-metal phase with electron doping, from which a linear scaling between zero-temperature superfluid density and strange-metal resistivity coefficient is further established. The scaling also applies to different iron-based and cuprate superconductors despite their distinct electronic structures and pairing symmetries. Such a correlation can be reproduced in a theoretical calculation on the two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model by considering a cooperative effect of quantum critical fluctuation and disorder.

Here, we introduce human cortical organoid microphysiological systems (hCO-MPSs) to study AD monocyte-mediated neuroinflammation. By culturing doughnut-shape organoids on 3D-printed devices within standard 96-well plates, we generate hCO-MPSs with reduced necrosis, minimized hypoxia, and improved viability. Using these models, we found that monocytes from AD patients exhibit increased infiltration ability, decreased amyloid-β clearance capacity, and stronger inflammatory response than monocytes from age-matched control donors. Moreover, we observed that AD monocytes induce pro-inflammatory effects such as elevated astrocyte activation and neuronal apoptosis. Furthermore, the marked increase inIL1BandCCL3expression underscores their pivotal role in AD monocyte-mediated neuroinflammation.

Here, we use mobilized colistin resistance (mcr-1), which modifies lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to confer colistin resistance, as a model to explore how bacteria reallocate resources to supportmcr-1–mediated resistance. We show that bacteria redirect resources from glycolysis, the pyruvate cycle, and LPS biosynthesis toward glycerophospholipid metabolism to produce phosphatidylethanolamine, the substrate formcr-1to modify LPS, while reducing LPS content to limit colistin binding. This reallocation down-regulates succinyl–coenzyme A (CoA) to diminish succinylation of proteins including triosephosphate isomerase (TPI), CpxR, and PdhR, thereby sustaining resistance. Exogenous succinate or α-ketoglutarate restores succinylation in a succinyl-CoA–dependent manner. Succinylation of TPI redirects metabolic flux to glycolysis and the pyruvate cycle, while succinylation of CpxR and PdhR up-regulates LPS biosynthesis, ultimately attenuating colistin resistance. Thus, we reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which bacteria regulate resource allocation through metabolism-driven posttranslational protein modification, offering strategies to combat antibiotic resistance."

Systematic measurements show that conductance, streaming current, and osmotic current are larger in semiconducting tubes than in metallic ones. Together with a complete theoretical framework, we found that such behavior is caused by the smaller liquid-solid friction with the same surface charge density for the semiconducting system. As fast ion transport is the key element for efficient energy conversion, in CNTs, the thermoelectric conversion efficiency with ions is two orders of magnitude larger than with electrons, showing the supremacy of ions to recover the waste heat."

Here, we identify aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10), down-regulated in gastrointestinal cancers, as a pivotal metastasis suppressor correlating with improved colorectal cancer (CRC) prognosis. Mechanistically, AKR1B10 activates protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) by preventing redox-regulated nitration of its B56α subunit, preserving holoenzyme assembly and enabling c-Myc dephosphorylation at serine-62. Loss of AKR1B10 disrupts this pathway, stabilizing c-Myc, which drives integrin signaling and metastatic dissemination in CRC. We further demonstrate that lysine-125 of AKR1B10 is essential for its interaction with PP2A-Cα and B56α nitration, thereby attenuating CRC metastatic aggressiveness. Pharmacological restoration of PP2A activity effectively mitigates metastasis associated with AKR1B10 loss. In addition, c-Myc transcriptionally represses AKR1B10, establishing a feedback loop that sustains its down-regulation and enhances metastatic progression.

Larger gastruloids exhibit delayed symmetry breaking, increased multipolarity, and prolonged axial elongation, with morphogenesis driven by size. Despite these variations, transcriptional programs and cell fate composition remain stable across a broad size range, illustrating the scaling of gene expression domains. In particular, extreme sizes show distinct transcriptional modules and shifts in gene expression patterns. Size perturbation experiments rescued the morphogenetic and pattern phenotypes observed in extreme sizes, demonstrating the adaptability of gastruloids to their effective system size. These findings position gastruloids as versatile models for dissecting spatiotemporal coordination in mammalian development and reveal how physical constraints can decouple gene expression programs from morphogenetic progression."

The prognosis of a real-world cohort of 240 patients with colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) undergoing major and minor hepatectomy was compared after adjusting for confounding factors. To model CRLM, we induced liver metastasis in mice by transsplenically injecting MC38 cells. We found that patients with CRLM and mice undergoing major hepatectomy had better survival compared to those undergoing minor hepatectomy. Mechanistically, extensive hepatectomy activates hepatocellular YAP1 by regulating the epidermal growth factor receptor, altering glutamine metabolism–related gene expression and increasing liver glutamine consumption. This metabolic shift leads to glutamine scarcity in tumor cells, causing increased reactive oxygen species production, which promotes loss of YAP1 activity in tumor cells. Consequently, the production of the chemokine CXCL5 is suppressed, which inhibits myeloid-derived suppressor cell infiltration and enhancing the immunological function of CD8+T cells."

We investigated PTC genomic profiles to distinguish radiation-induced versus sporadic oncogenic drivers by modeling dose and molecular characteristics by driver category:BRAFV600E(n= 132), RAS mutation (n= 31), fusions generated from two breakpoints and <20 base pairs (bp) breakpoint gain/loss (Fusion2B<20bp;n= 63), or ≥3 breakpoints and ≥1000 bp breakpoint loss (n= 20). The frequency of Fusion2B<20bp-PTC increased with increasing thyroid radiation dose, whereas all others declined. Clonal small deletion counts increased with increasing radiation dose for Fusion2B<20bp-PTC (P= 5.1 × 10−4) but not other drivers (P> 0.08). Clonal clock mutational signatures, marking the age of tumor initiation, were associated with age at the accident for Fusion2B<20bp-PTC (P= 8.2 × 10−4) but not other drivers (P> 0.21). Together, these results support a causal role for ionizing radiation in Fusion2B<20bp-PTC as a group but not other drivers."

Growing evidence suggests that functional heterogeneity exists within the naïve T cell pool, shaping lineage potential before antigen stimulation. Here, we identify a subpopulation of naïve CD8 T cells expressing death-associated protein-like 1 (Dapl1) that contains preprogrammed precursors biased toward memory differentiation. The differentiation of these precursors is independent of Dapl1 but relies on the transcription factor B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia 11b (Bcl11b), resulting in the generation of Dapl1+central memory–like CD8 T cells after infection and stem-like memory cells in cancer. Dapl1+naïve T cells originate among mature thymocytes and gradually appear in the periphery postnatally. Peripheral Dapl1+and Dapl1−populations show limited plasticity, supporting a thymic-imprinting model.

Therefore, it is important to ensure the fatigue reliability of additive manufactured materials across all stress ratios. We found that the AM microstructure itself in a Ti-6Al-4V alloy successfully synthesizes the tripartite advantages of fine prior β grain boundaries, void-free, and fine α grains, which are respectively sensitive to the low, medium, and high stress ratio regions. Under this synergistic effect, the fatigue performance of the natural AM microstructure across all stress ratios not only outperforms all additive manufactured and forged Ti-6Al-4V alloys, but also surpasses other metallic materials.

Low-dose white light irradiation (20 milliwatts per square centimeter for 10 minutes) substantially decreased the half-maximal inhibitory concentration of the optimized COE against A549 cancer cells from more than 256 to 0.6 micromolar. Typical photodynamic and photothermal effects were not responsible for the potent anticancer efficacy. Biophysical and photophysical experiments using vesicle models revealed that COEs can induce mechanical force likely by molecular conformation change within lipid membranes under light exposure, supporting the mechanotherapeutic mechanism by which COEs after excitation can physically disrupt cell membrane. Investigation of two other COEs with similar spectral properties but different backbone architectures revealed that their mechanotherapeutic efficacy is dependent on molecular topology.

TDCA-P2Y10 engagement inducesZfp414transcription to prime expression of CD69 and integrin αE on ILCs, leading to intestinal residency of ILCs. Moreover, decreased levels of TDCA or P2Y10 deficiency abrogates the intestinal residency of ILCs, resulting in severer intestinal inflammation.

While direct interspecies electron transport is proposed to enable ANME/SRB symbiosis, its electrochemical properties remain uncharacterized. Here, using sediment-free enrichment cultures, we measured the electron transport capabilities of marine consortia under physiological conditions. Diverse ANME/SRB consortia exhibited high dry conductance close to electrogenic biofilms. This conductance diminished upon exposure to heat or oxygen but was preserved following paraformaldehyde fixation, indicating a biomolecular origin for this electric charge transfer. Cyclic voltammetry revealed redox activity centered at 28 ± 11, 94 ± 6, and 24 ± 7 millivolts for ANME-1/Desulfofervidus, ANME-2a/Seep-SRB1, and ANME-2a+2c/Seep-SRB1+2 consortia, respectively.

While SOT switching of out-of-plane (OOP) magnetized states requires lateral symmetry breaking, in-plane (IP) magnetized states suffer from low storage density. Here, we demonstrate a field-free switching scheme using a 5-nanometer europium iron garnet film grown with a (110) orientation that shows a spin reorientation transition from OOP to IP above room temperature. This scheme combines the benefits of high-density storage in the OOP states at room temperature and the efficient field-free SOT switching in the IP states at elevated temperatures. While conventional switching of OOP bits faces the dilemma that high OOP anisotropy is required to improve bit stability and low OOP anisotropy is required to lower switching current density, this scheme disentangles this interdependence, allowing for low switching currents to be possible without sacrificing the bit stability, offering opportunities for future memory devices."

We discover a distinct “staging” behavior during the oxidation process: A fully ordered intermediate phase, SrCoO2.75, forms before transitioning into a near-perovskite SrCoO3−δ. In addition, antiphase boundaries, originating at step terraces of SrTiO3, alleviate strain by creating reversible nanoscale “gaps” during lattice contraction under oxidation, providing a pathway for preserving structural integrity throughout redox cycling.

Unlike data-driven approaches, BayROM does not require training datasets, but instead, it uses probabilistic model-based reconstruction to facilitate fast high-resolution imaging.

Functional assays show that insulin-like growth factor/fibroblast growth factor signaling promotes feather elongation via tyrosine kinase receptor signaling.

In Phoenix chickens, superlong main sickle feathers exhibit specialized stem cell zones with enhancedDLL1expression and expanded intermediate-layer cell clusters with dynamic interactions involvingNOTCH1/DLL1,YAP1, and WNT signaling in progenitor zones in the proximal follicle.

A 2.5-Å cocrystal structure of the AMPK kinase domain with BAY-3827 revealed distinct features including a disulfide bridge between the αD helix Cys106and the activation loop residue Cys174.
