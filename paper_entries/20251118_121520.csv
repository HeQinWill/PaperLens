There is also evidence of racial/ethnic disparities in the siting of this infrastructure for select components. However, population counts and demographic composition near fossil fuel energy infrastructure have not been systematically characterized across all types, supply chain stages, and predominant fuel types. Here, we construct a dataset of 25 elements of fossil fuel energy infrastructure and characterize the populations living near this infrastructure (defined as within 800 m [∼0.5 mile] or 1.6 km [∼1 mile]). We estimated that 46.6 million people in the contiguous U.S., representing 14.1% of the population, live within 1.6 km of at least one piece of energy infrastructure, with racial/ethnic disparities observed across nearly all stages of the supply chain. End use infrastructure has the most people residing within 1.6 km, with 20.9 million people, followed by extraction (20.3 million), and storage (6.16 million). Storage infrastructure has an average of ∼2,900 people living within 1.6 km of each element; end use infrastructure has an average of 1,900 people residing within 1.6 km of each element; extraction infrastructure has an average of 17 people residing within 1.6 km of each element. Almost 90% of the population near end use, transportation, refining, and storage infrastructure are in urban areas. Our results represent a substantial population in the U.S. that is potentially exposed to hazards that are not well-characterized, with unknown cumulative impacts, and which constitute a major environmental justice issue."

However, the extent to which phytoplankton feedback influences ENSO remains unclear. Chlorophyll in phytoplankton warms the upper ocean by absorbing solar radiation, and this effect weakens during El Niño and strengthens during La Niña, yet its overall impact is not well quantified. Using a simple nitrogen-based Nitrate–Phytoplankton–Zooplankton–Detritus pelagic model, here we show that phytoplankton concentration anomalies significantly dampen ENSO by cooling sea surface temperature by 0.69 °C during El Niño development and warming it by 1.09 °C during La Niña, with mean amplitudes of 1.71 °C and 1.42 °C, respectively. This may partially contributes to the amplitude asymmetry of ENSO, and accounts for 16.8% of total shortwave radiation-related damping during El Niño and 17.4% during La Niña. Our offline modeling approach successfully isolates this direct heating effect by excluding indirect dynamical effects of phytoplankton to physical variables."
10.5194/acp-25-15631-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文的标题和摘要都表明其与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。该研究提出了一种新的方法，通过模拟NOx化学来估计化石燃料CO2（ffCO2）的排放量。该方法利用气象输入参数化NOx化学反应速率和NO2:NO比率，并与卫星数据（如TROPOMI）进行比较。该研究旨在提高ffCO2估算的准确性，并支持全球排放监测和气候变化减缓工作。因此，该研究与空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['NOx', 'Fossil Fuel CO2 Emissions', 'Air Quality Monitoring', 'Satellite Observations (TROPOMI)', 'Atmospheric Composition Analysis (NO2:NO ratio)', 'Model Inversion', 'Photochemistry']",Chlöe N. Schooling;Paul I. Palmer;Auke Visser;Nicolas Bousserez,Development of a parametrised atmospheric NOx chemistry scheme to help quantify fossil fuel CO2 emission estimates,"This study presents a new method to estimate fossil fuel CO2 (ffCO2) emissions by modelling NOx chemistry. Our regression models predict NOx chemical rates and NO2 : NO ratios with R² values above 0.95 using meteorological inputs. Incorporating these regressions reduces computational time compared to traditional methods and enables integration into model inversion frameworks. This scalable approach supports global emissions monitoring and climate change mitigation efforts. 
 Success of the Paris Agreement relies on rapid reductions in fossil fuel CO2 (ffCO2) emissions. Atmospheric data can verify the ffCO2 reductions pledged by nations in their nationally determined contributions. However, estimating ffCO2 from atmospheric CO2 is challenging due to natural fluxes and varying backgrounds. One approach is to combine with nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2), which are co-emitted with CO2 during combustion. A key challenge in using NOx to estimate ffCO2 is the computational cost of modelling atmospheric photochemistry. Additionally, the NO2 : NO column ratio must be well understood to convert model NOx columns to NO2 columns for comparison with satellite data. We use random forest regression to parameterise NOx chemistry, relying only on meteorological parameters and NOx concentration. The regression is trained on outputs from a nested GEOS (Goddard Earth Observing System)-Chem model simulation for mainland Europe in 2019. We develop a monthly NOx chemistry parameterisation that performs well when tested on perturbed emission runs (R2 > 0.95) and on unseen meteorology for 2021 (R2 > 0.79). We also parameterise the NO2 : NO ratio (R2 > 0.99 on perturbed outputs, R2 > 0.92 on unseen meteorology). Additionally, we present an alternative method to predict NOx rates by scaling baseline NOx rates with changes in NOx concentration (R2 = 1.0 on perturbed outputs). Our models reproduce NO2 columns with minimal deviation from full-chemistry models, with reconstruction error smaller than the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) precision in over 99.9 % of cases, supporting robust ffCO2 inversion efforts. These results provide a robust framework for accurately estimating fossil fuel CO2 emissions from atmospheric data, enabling more reliable monitoring and verification of global emissions reductions."
10.5194/acp-25-15683-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇研究论文主要关注纽约市的甲烷排放问题。研究人员通过六年的冬季到春季的连续屋顶观测数据，发现纽约市的甲烷排放量被排放清单低估，尤其是在冬季。研究结果表明，甲烷和一氧化碳可能存在共同的城市不完全燃烧源，而目前的排放清单中缺少对这一来源的考虑。该研究使用了连续测量方法，揭示了城市甲烷排放的日变化规律，并强调了长期、多物种方法在约束城市温室气体排放及其来源方面的作用。虽然论文主要依赖于地面观测，但提到了飞机和卫星观测，因此与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）密切相关。,"['methane emissions', 'carbon monoxide', 'urban emissions', 'emission inventories', 'rooftop measurements', 'incomplete combustion', 'air quality monitoring', 'satellite observations (mentioned)', 'atmospheric composition analysis']",Luke D. Schiferl;Andrew Hallward-Driemeier;Yuwei Zhao;Ricardo Toledo-Crow;Róisín Commane,Missing wintertime methane emissions from  New York City related to combustion,"Identifying and quantifying methane emissions from urban sources is important for mitigating climate change. Using 6 years of winter and spring observations, we found that methane emissions from New York City are highly variable and underestimated compared to inventories, especially in winter, and correlate well with emissions of carbon monoxide (CO). Our results suggest a common urban incomplete combustion source for both methane and CO currently missing from emissions inventories. 
 Accurately quantifying methane emissions from cities, and understanding the processes that drive these emissions, is important for reaching climate mitigation goals. Methane emissions from New York City metropolitan area (NYCMA), the most populous urban area of the United States, have consistently been underestimated by emission inventories compared to aircraft and satellite observations. In this study, we used continuous rooftop measurements of methane over six winter-to-spring transitions (January–May 2019–2024) to examine the variability of city-scale methane enhancements (ΔCH4) and estimate methane emissions from the NYCMA. We found large variability in the 10 d mean observed ΔCH4 (∼50–250 ppbv) and monthly afternoon methane emissions rates (10.1–30.4 kg s−1) within and between the years of our study period. A recently released high-resolution regional methane emission inventory developed for the NYCMA performed better than other global and national inventories against the rooftop observations but still underestimated methane emissions, especially in winter. The estimates of methane emissions correlated with those of carbon monoxide (CO) emissions, determined from coincident measurements, suggesting a common city-scale incomplete combustion source for both methane and CO. Our analysis of these continuous measurements also implies a consistent diurnal cycle in urban methane emissions from the NYCMA, which reveals a potential bias in traditional afternoon-only approaches in this domain. This work highlights the usefulness of a long term, multi-species approach to constrain urban greenhouse gas emissions and their sources."
10.5194/acp-25-15701-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文主要研究了亚洲地区生物质燃烧排放物对大气环境的影响。研究利用温室气体增强比率、痕量气体和颗粒散射等机载测量数据，识别了受生物质燃烧影响的空气团。此外，还使用了大气传输模型和卫星热点产品来分析生物质燃烧排放物的传输历史。论文重点介绍了在ASIA-AQ（亚洲空气质量机载和卫星调查）活动期间，特别是在泰国地区，生物质燃烧的影响。该研究开发了一种方法，通过结合多种生物质燃烧标记物来识别受生物质燃烧影响的数据，并为进一步的分析（如反向轨迹分析、卫星热点产品对比和气溶胶微物理特性研究）提供依据。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，涉及空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等领域。,"['biomass burning emissions', 'greenhouse gases', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric transport models', 'satellite hotspot products', 'trace gases', 'particle scattering', 'ASIA-AQ campaign', 'GEMS (Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer)']",Jason A.

Crounse;Paul Wennberg;Felix Piel;Stefan Swift;Wojciech Wojnowski;Armin Wisthaler,Technical note: Identifying biomass burning emissions during ASIA-AQ using greenhouse gas enhancement ratios,"Biomass burning is a significant source of greenhouse gases and airborne pollutants in Asia. Airborne measurements of greenhouse gas enhancement ratios, trace gases, and particle scattering were used to identify air masses impacted by biomass burning over several Asian countries during February and March of 2024. Further analysis using atmospheric transport models and satellite hotspot products was performed to understand the transport history of biomass burning impacted airmasses over Thailand. 
 Biomass burning (BB) is a primary source of atmospheric chemistry reactants, aerosols, and greenhouse gases. Smoke plumes have air quality impacts local to the fire itself and regionally via long distance transport. Open burning of agriculture fields in Southeast Asia leads to frequent seasonal occurrences of regional BB-induced smoke haze and long-range transport of BB particles via the northeast monsoon. The Airborne and Satellite Investigation of Asian Air Quality (ASIA-AQ) campaign visited several areas including the Philippines, South Korea, Thailand, and Taiwan during a time of agricultural burning. This campaign consisted of airborne measurements on the NASA DC-8 aircraft aimed to validate observations from South Korea's Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) and to address local air quality challenges. We developed a method that used a combination of BB markers to identify ASIA-AQ DC-8 data influenced by BB and flag them for further analysis. Specifically, we used rolling slope enhancement ratios of CO/CO2 and CH4/CO along with mixing ratios of CH3CN, HCN, and CO, and particle scattering coefficient measurements. The flag was triggered when a combination of these variables exceeded a flight specific threshold. We found varying levels of BB-influence in the areas studied, with data flagged for BB being < 1 % for the Philippines and Korea, and < 2 % for Taiwan, but 19 % for Thailand. Our method for flagging ASIA-AQ BB-affected data can be used to focus additional analyses of the ASIA-AQ campaign such as pairing with back trajectories, satellite hotspot products, and microphysical aerosol characteristics."

Baier;Patrick Jöckel;J. Moritz Menken;Tanja J. Schuck;Colm Sweeney;Andreas Engel,CO2 variability and seasonal cycle in the UTLS: insights from EMAC model and AirCore observational data,"We investigate the distribution of CO2 in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere using both, observations and an atmospheric model. Simulating an artificial tracer, we separate CO2 seasonality from long-term trend and transport variability. We found that patterns in the seasonal signal are attributable to large-scale transport features like the subtropical jet or the Brewer-Dobson circulation. Being a powerful diagnostic tool we recommend to use this tracer for model intercomparisons. 
 The complex distribution of CO2 in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) results from the interplay of different processes and mechanisms. However, in such difficult-to-access regions of the atmosphere our understanding of the CO2 variability remains limited. Using vertical trace gas profiles derived from measurements with the balloon-based AirCore technique for validation, we investigate the UTLS and stratospheric CO2 distribution simulated with the ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) global chemistry-climate model. By simulating an artificial, deseasonalised CO2 tracer, we disentangle the CO2 seasonal signal from long-term trend and transport contribution. This approach allows us to study the CO2 seasonal cycle in a unique way in remote areas and on a global scale. Our results show that the tropospheric CO2 seasonal cycle propagates upwards into the lowermost stratosphere and is most modulated in the extra-tropics between 300–100 hPa, characterised by a 50 % amplitude dampening and a 4-month phase shift in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes. During this propagation the seasonal cycle shape is also tilted, which is associated with the transport barrier related to the strength of the subtropical jet. In the stratosphere, we identified both, a vertical and a horizontal “tape recorder” of the CO2 seasonal cycle. Originating in the tropical tropopause region this imprint is linked to the upwelling and the shallow branch of the Brewer-Dobson-circulation. As the CO2 seasonal signal carries information about transport processes on different timescales, the newly introduced tracer is a very useful diagnostic tool and would also be a suitable metric for model intercomparisons."

Zorn;Thomas F. Mentel,Formation of highly oxygenated organic molecules from α-pinene photooxidation: evidence for the importance of highly oxygenated alkoxy radicals,"Highly oxygenated organic molecules by atmospheric oxidation of plant emitted monoterpenes are important components in secondary organic aerosol formation. Autoxidation of organic peroxy radicals is one important pathway of their formation. We show that isomerization of highly oxygenated alkoxy radicals leads to highly oxygenated peroxy radicals that continue the autoxidation chain. Alkoxy-peroxy steps may dominate the formation of highly oxygenated molecules at high nitrogen oxide levels. 
 Highly oxygenated organic compounds (HOMs) from α-pinene oxidation are of great interest because of their importance in secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. Despite intensive investigations, the mechanisms of HOM formation from first-generation peroxy radicals to HOM-peroxy radicals (HOM-RO2•) and to HOM-closed shell products are not well understood. One reason is that HOM-alkoxy radicals (HOM-RO•) are likely to contribute to the propagation of oxidative radical chains (alkoxy-peroxy pathway) because isomerization of functionalized alkoxy radicals can compete with their fragmentation (and reaction with O2), as shown by theoretical kinetics. However, HOM-RO• reaction steps are difficult to verify in mechanisms. In this work, we have investigated HOM formation by varying the significance of the alkoxy-peroxy pathway as a function of NOx, OH•, and CO. HOM-RO• are likely formed with high branching ratios in reactions of HOM-RO2• with peroxy radicals and NO in analogy to simpler alkoxy radicals. We provide experimental evidence that for HOM-RO• the branching into isomerization is about 50 % (±14 %). Thus, HOM-RO• can play a central role in HOM formation, since alkoxy-peroxy pathways can compete with direct autoxidation. We observed significant concentrations of HOM-RO2•, despite fast termination by NO, and shifts to higher O/C for HOM-RO2• and termination products with increasing NO. At NO concentrations > 1.5 ppb, the alkoxy-peroxy pathway may even prevail in propagating the oxidative radical chain leading to HOM formation. The increasing sink of HOM-RO2• with increasing concentration of peroxy radicals and NO is compensated by an increasing source via the alkoxy-peroxy pathway.This manuscript is dedicated to Astrid Kiendler-Scharr (deceased, 6 February 2023)."

Our model underestimated boundary layer height and showed warm biases, affecting ODE simulation. Updates improved coastal ozone agreement but failed to capture strong ODEs. Bromine monoxide (BrO) was overestimated at the surface yet underestimated in columns. Long-term data show declining strong ODEs since 2008, suggesting additional climate-driven factors beyond sea ice age. 
 Ozone depletion events (ODEs) and bromine explosions (BEs) occur regularly in the springtime polar boundary layer. ODEs alter the oxidation capacity of the polar boundary layer and promote formation of toxic mercury. We investigated Arctic ODEs and BEs in 2019/2020 using the chemistry-climate model ECHAM/MESSy v2.55.2, nudged with ERA5 reanalysis data. Model results were evaluated against surface ozone measurements, satellite-derived tropospheric BrO vertical column densities (VCDs), and in situ data from the MOSAiC expedition. The model underestimated boundary layer (BL) height during shallow BL conditions, coinciding with a warm surface temperature bias (2–10 K), particularly below −10 °C, likely inherited from ERA5. An updated model configuration, incorporating more realistic multi-year sea ice and relaxed bromine release thresholds, improved agreement with coastal ozone observations (Eureka, Utqiaġvik) but still failed to reproduce strong ODEs observed during MOSAiC. Consequently, modeled surface BrO mixing ratios were overestimated, while BrO VCDs were underestimated, suggesting that simply increasing Br2 emissions does not resolve discrepancies. A weaker colocation between modeled BrO VCDs and ODEs aligns with prior airborne studies and may reflect tropospheric chemical and transport processes rather than stratospheric contributions. Despite decreasing Arctic sea ice extent and increasing BrO VCDs, long-term records from Alert, Utqiaġvik, and Zeppelin show a decline in strong ODE frequency since 2008. This suggests that bromine emissions from first-year sea ice alone may not fully account for observed ODE variability, and that additional climate-sensitive mechanisms may modulate Arctic ozone chemistry. Long-term model integrations are recommended to better understand these trends."

Kumjian,Detection of Multi-Modal Doppler Spectra – Part 2: Evaluation of the Detection Algorithm and Exploring Characteristics of Multi-modal Spectra Using a Long-term Dataset,"We demonstrate the detection algorithm is successful, with 89.6 % of events verifying. Using this radar moment-based algorithm will save users time and computational expenses of processing large spectral datasets when looking for case studies of processes associated with multi-modal spectra. Storing linear depolarization ratio for detected events can facilitate finding cases specific to ice or drizzle events. Pairing this with temperature helps determine processes that may be active. 
 In this paper, we process three years of vertically pointing Ka-band radar spectral data according to the methodology described and established in Part 1 (Wugofski et al., 2025). Across three years of data, we demonstrate that the detection algorithm is successful in identifying multi-modal spectra, with 89.6 % of detected events verifying. Beyond the verification, we explore other characteristics of the detected events such as the height, depth, and temperature of the layers containing secondary modes. Reanalysis data from ERA5 was used to gain additional context to the environmental conditions associated with the detected events. By connecting temperatures from ERA5 with the detected layers, we assess the potential for these events to be associated with common microphysical processes such as growth of columns or plates, Hallett–Mossop rime splintering, dendritic growth, and primary ice nucleation. We further explore the potential microphysical processes revealed by the multi-modal spectra using spectrally integrated linear depolarization ratio to determine if the secondary mode may comprise ice crystals that can produce such a signal. Of the cases with a detected enhanced LDR signal, >64.1 % of those occurred in a layer with a mean temperature consistent with columnar ice or Hallett–Mossop rime splintering. Finally, three cases are investigated in more detail to illustrate the variety of events detected by the algorithm."

Because each laboratory uses slightly different methods, we adjusted the data to make it directly comparable. This allowed us to create a consistent record of atmospheric methane concentration and its isotopes from 1988 to 2023. 
 Establishing interlaboratory compatibility among measurements of stable isotope ratios of atmospheric methane (δ13C-CH4 and δD-CH4) is challenging. Significant offsets are common because laboratories have different ties to the VPDB or SMOW-SLAP scales. Umezawa et al. (2018) surveyed numerous comparison efforts for CH4 isotope measurements conducted from 2003 to 2017 and found scale offsets of up to 0.5 ‰ for δ13C-CH4 and 13 ‰ for δD-CH4 between laboratories. This exceeds the World Meteorological Organisation Global Atmospheric Watch (WMO-GAW) network compatibility targets of 0.02 ‰ and 1 ‰ considerably.We employ a method to establish scale offsets between laboratories using their reported CH4 isotope measurements on atmospheric samples. Our study includes data from eight laboratories with experience in high-precision isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) measurements for atmospheric CH4. The analysis relies exclusively on routine atmospheric measurements conducted by these laboratories at high-latitude stations in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, where we assume each measurement represents sufficiently well-mixed air at the latitude for direct comparison. We use two methodologies for interlaboratory comparisons: (I) assessing differences between time-adjacent observation data and (II) smoothing the observed data using polynomial and harmonic functions before comparison. The results of both methods are consistent, and with a few exceptions, the overall average offsets between laboratories align well with those reported by Umezawa et al. (2018). This indicates that interlaboratory offsets remain robust over multi-year periods. The evaluation of routine measurements allows us to calculate the interlaboratory offsets from hundreds, in some cases thousands of measurements. Therefore, the uncertainty in the mean interlaboratory offset is not limited by the analytical error of a single analysis but by real atmospheric variability between the sampling dates and stations. Using the same method, we assess this uncertainty by investigating measurements from four high-latitude sites analysed by the INSTAAR laboratory. After applying the derived interlaboratory offsets, we present a harmonised time series for δ13C-CH4 and δD-CH4 at high northern and southern latitudes, covering the period from 1988 to 2023."

By applying an advanced aerosol retrieval algorithm called GRASP, we were able to more accurately observe both atmospheric and ground conditions and their dynamics over time. The results closely matched ground-based measurements and showed potential for even better monitoring when combined with ground-based lidar data. 
 The Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard the Himawari-8 geostationary satellite is an imager with 16 spectral bands covering from the visible to infrared. The AHI has high temporal resolution with observation frequency of every 10 min and high spatial resolution 0.5–2 km (depending on channel) for full disk, which provides great potential for studying the dynamics of aerosol properties in East Asia and Western Pacific regions. In this study, the development of aerosol and surface property retrievals from the AHI/Himawari-8 using the Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties (GRASP) algorithm is described. Due to the pseudo multi-angular observations obtained from AHI/Himawari-8 and the flexibility of GRASP algorithm with its innovative multi-pixel concept, multiple time and spatial pixels were retrieved simultaneously with both aerosol and surface properties constrained between the pixels together with additional constraints on spectral variability of underlying surface parameters within each pixel.The developed GRASP based algorithm has been applied to AHI/Himwari-8 observations over land for the entire year of 2018, and over ocean for May 2018 only, due to computational resource limitations and the relatively lower complexity of aerosol retrievals over ocean. The generated retrieval products were validated against the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements and were also intercompared with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface products. Overall, the validation analysis shows robust agreement of AHI/GRASP spectral AOD product with AERONET with correlation coefficients of 0.82–0.93 across the spectrum over land. The AHI/GRASP results demonstrate encouraging agreement with AERONET that is with 34.4 % of the AOD (510 nm) satisfying the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) requirement, and a bias within ±0.02 for AOD over land. The validation for fine and coarse mode AOD also showed promising results with a correlation of 0.89 and mean bias of 0.04 for fine mode AOD when compared with AERONET measurements. As for the intercomparisons with MODIS products, the overall performance is quite comparable to MODIS surface products. In addition to the analysis of AHI/Himawari-8 alone retrieval, this study demonstrated a novel synergetic retrieval between AHI/Himawari-8 and micro-pulse lidar (MPL). Using this synergy resulted in further improvements of the aerosol retrievals especially over the low AOD conditions due to the improved sensitivity to aerosol."

Laboratory and in-flight tests confirmed its precision and stability. Observed gradients near the tropopause reveal active mixing and transport processes in the tropopause region. 
 In this paper we introduce the new TropoPause Composition TOwed Sensor Shuttle (TPC-TOSS), which constitutes an advanced development of the AIRcraft TOwed Sensor Shuttle (AIRTOSS), introduced by Frey et al. (2009). As part of a tandem measurement platform with a Learjet 35A, both platforms were equipped with redundant instruments for co-located measurements of aerosol size distribution (Ultra-High Sensitivity Aerosol Spectrometer, UHSAS), ozone (2BTech model 205), cloud particles (Back-Scatter Cloud Probe, BCP), as well as relative humidity, temperature and pressure. To measure the exact position of the two platforms as well as the relative distance of the TPC-TOSS to the Learjet a Global Positioning System (GPS) is installed on both platforms. Two identical Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) further allow to monitor attitude angles (roll, pitch, and heading) and accelerations. Laboratory tests before and ground tests as well as in-flight tests during the intensive operation period show a good agreement of the ozone and temperature measurements of better than 4.2 ppbv +1.1 % (ozone) and 0.5 °C (temperature) at a noise level of ± (2 ppbv + 0.5 %) for 2 s data (ozone) and ± 0.1 K for 1 Hz data (temperature). Stability of the ozone monitor mounted in the TPC-TOSS has been tested and is estimated to be 2.2 ppbv (offset, 1σ) and 0.7 % (gain, 1σ), respectively, based on the drift of offset and gain during regular calibrations between measurement flights in the two weeks operation period. The new TPC-TOSS was successfully flown during the TPEx I (TropoPause composition gradients and mixing Experiment) mission in June 2024 and performed four flights covering the altitude range between 6.4 and 10.9 km. The tropopause was crossed several times as evident from different temperature and ozone gradients as well as gradients of the aerosol number concentration. With the setup we are able to resolve transient stability and composition gradients ranging from almost zero or even negative to strong positive gradients of up to 25 K km−1 for potential temperature and from inverted to strong positive vertical gradients of ozone of up to 800 ppbv km−1, respectively. These gradients are caused by transport and mixing due to convection or shear induced turbulence at the tropopause."

However, methods used to advect them typically do not respect the mass conservation equation, resulting in gaps and bunches in the tracer distribution. Here a method to correct this, based on nudging tracer positions in order to respect mass conservation, is presented. Tests show that it is effective and has a low computational cost. 
 Tracers/markers/particles are commonly used in geodynamical models to track composition and sometimes other quantities throughout the domain. A common problem is that over time, gaps in the tracer distribution can develop, often resulting in cells with no tracers as well as bunching of tracers. These arise when tracer advection does not perfectly respect the mass conservation equation, so here this equation is used to derive a correction method that perturbs or “nudges” the positions of tracers in such a way as to close gaps and eliminate bunching. Test results show that this tracer nudging method is highly effective. Starting from an extremely heterogeneous tracer distribution with large regions of the domain devoid of tracers, it can produce an even distribution in only a few nudge iterations. In a time-stepping situation with a nudge every time-step, the amplitudes of the nudges are small yet sufficient to prevent gaps and bunches, allowing a low-order tracer advection method to be used while maintaining a tracer distribution that is more even than that obtained using higher-order advection methods alone. The computational cost is small – slightly larger than that of a first-order tracer advection step alone - because the method simply requires solving a Poisson equation. If an accuracy threshold is applied, a nudge correction may be necessary in only a fraction of time steps, with tests indicating that it is fastest to use low order advection with more frequent nudges than high order advection with less frequent nudges."

We validate GAMCR on synthetic data and demonstrate its ability to investigate the characteristic runoff responses from real-world hydrologic series. GAMCR provides new data-driven opportunities to understand and compare hydrological behavior across different catchments. 
 Estimating the hydrologic response of watersheds to precipitation events is key to understanding streamflow generation processes. Impulse Response Functions, commonly referred to as the Instantaneous Unit Hydrograph (IUH) in hydrology, have been used for over 50 years to predict stormflow and compare catchment behaviors. These response functions are often strongly affected by modelers' choices of parameters and data preprocessing procedures, limiting their diagnostic utility and generalizability across different sites and time periods. With the increasing availability of compiled rainfall-runoff series, there is now a growing opportunity to develop new approaches that fully exploit such datasets. This paper introduces GAMCR, a novel data-driven approach that employs Generalized Additive Models (GAM) to estimate time-dependent Catchment Responses (CR). GAMCR is designed to capture the complex, nonlinear relationships between precipitation and runoff, offering a flexible and interpretable framework for the systematic analysis of hydrological responses. The model is successfully validated on synthetic data, where the true response functions are known. Additionally, we demonstrate the model's potential using observed data from six Swiss basins with distinct hydrological behaviors. Results are fully consistent with those obtained from ERRA, another recent data-driven approach with a very different architecture, as well as with the climate and physical properties of the sites. Overall, GAMCR is a modern and effective tool for leveraging rainfall-runoff datasets to investigate the controls on hydrologic responses in small to midsize basins under conditions similar to those studied here, and it provides a framework that can be further explored in other climatic and physiographic settings in future research."

The model predicts summer 2013 emissions of 10.92–11.37 teragrams of carbon. Validation shows our model performs better than the existing models, revealing underestimated isoprene impacts on ozone pollution in eastern China. 
 Isoprene is the dominant non-methane Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emitted from terrestrial ecosystems and plays an important role in ozone chemistry. Understanding isoprene emissions is critical for controlling air pollution. The Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) is widely used to calculate biogenic isoprene emissions worldwide. While MEGAN predictions are good for many regions, a previous analysis of isoprene observations around China showed large discrepancies between observed and simulated isoprene concentrations. The uncertainties of isoprene emissions in China are also reflected in the large differences between MEGAN version 2.1 and 3.1. In this work, bottom-up high-resolution vegetation distributions and updated emission factors are combined with satellite data in the Speciated Isoprene Emission Model with the MEGAN Algorithm for China (SieMAC) to improve isoprene emission estimates in China. The results from this new emission inventory for summer 2013 improve upon MEGAN versions 2.1 and 3.1 when compared with isoprene observations and satellite HCHO products. This improved emission inventory is applied in a regional model, and the results indicate a potentially underestimated role of biogenic isoprene in ozone formation over polluted eastern China."

Although the combined effects of stressors are recognized, the manner in which the prestress state determines the basic response mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we used the “natural experiment” methodology to compare two major extreme events within a monsoon‐influenced, low‐latitude highlands setting to explain mechanistic changes in land‐atmosphere interactions. By analyzing an extensive set of remote sensing and reanalysis data with nonlinear structural equation modeling, we show that the ecosystem response shifted from a traditional water‐limited paradigm during the 2010 drought to an energy‐governed paradigm during the 2019 heatwave. Our results suggest that this transition is governed by the antecedent root zone soil moisture status, which acts as a tipping point fundamentally shifting the impact of atmospheric factors on canopy evapotranspiration screens, such as temperature and vapor pressure deficit. This study highlights a possible threshold‐type state dependence non‐linearity, which is lacking in major Earth System Models. Incorporating this “hydrological memory” is crucial for minimizing uncertainties in climate projections and for correctly assessing the vulnerability of ecosystems in a warming world."

In our experiments, anisotropic energetic electrons, produced by perpendicularly propagating microwaves at the equator of a magnetic mirror, provide the free energy for whistler excitation. The observed whistler waves exhibit a distinct periodic excitation pattern, analogous to naturally occurring whistler emissions in space. Particle‐in‐cell simulations reveal that this periodicity arises from a self‐regulating process: whistler‐induced pitch‐angle scattering rapidly relaxes the electron anisotropy, which subsequently rebuilds due to continuous energy injection and further excites wave.

The model predicts the seasonal (monthly moving average) salinity at a given location using a single dimensionless variable that represents the ratio of freshwater discharge to tidally driven discharge. The model is validated using data from 11 estuaries globally, showing strong predictive performance for seasonal salinity time series in each estuary, with mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 2.5 ± 1.3 psu across all estuaries.

To resolve this paradox, we re‐visit the sedimentary CaCO3 distribution and carbonate chemistry across the western Pacific with a carbonate accumulation model. Our results show that CSD shoals along the route of Lower Circumpolar Deep Water, resulted from respiration‐driven declining [CO32−]. In contrast, the development of mid‐depth carbonate undersaturation, caused by enhanced particulate organic carbon (POC) remineralization driven by high productivity, sharply raises the CSD in northern Northwest Pacific and substantially lowers the regional CaCO3 preservation.

The transport of air between the troposphere and stratosphere, known as stratosphere‐troposphere exchange (STE), involves greenhouse gases such as ozone and water vapor whose impact on Earth's radiation budget and climate is most sensitive to changes in UTLS composition. Therefore, we examine observations of STE in TCs and relate these changes to TC and environmental characteristics. We utilize 17 years of trace gas profiles from the Microwave Limb Sounder aboard the Aura satellite in conjunction with TC track information and environmental data to relate UTLS ozone and water vapor changes to TC intensity, distance from TC center, and environmental wind shear. We find that accounting for varying tropopause heights and basin‐specific background composition is important to accurate assessment of UTLS composition changes within a TC. We also find that TCs are associated with increased water vapor throughout most of the UTLS and dehydration at tropopause level, while ozone is reduced greatly in the upper troposphere.

These findings have critical implications for coastal communities, highlighting not only the increased risk of near‐storm rainfall but also the rapid intensification or decline of these rainfall events."

A neural network‐based scale‐adaptive cloud fraction scheme, predicting cloud area fraction that affects cloud radiative effects, was developed previously using CloudSat observations and demonstrated good performance in capturing cloud spatial distribution and vertical structure. This study further improves the scheme by considering in the inputs the atmospheric stability (affecting cloud formation and evolution) and introducing cloud volume fraction (important for cloud microphysics) as an additional output. Results show that including atmospheric stability significantly enhances both prediction accuracy and scale adaptability for cloud area fraction compared to the original scheme. On the test data set, root‐mean square errors (RMSEs) for liquid, mixed‐phase, and ice clouds are reduced by 15.5%, 11.6%, and 6.67%, respectively. These leads to better predictions of cloud area‐fraction vertical structure and spatial distribution, with RMSE reduced by 33% and 17% in those aspects. Notably, improvements are most pronounced for low‐level clouds, particularly in simulating the seasonal variation of stratocumulus over the Southeast Pacific and the cloud regime transitions along the Pacific Cross‐Section Intercomparison transect of the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment Cloud System Study/Working Group on Numerical Experimentation. The new scheme also performs well in predicting cloud volume fraction, showing accuracy and scale adaptability comparable to that for area fraction. Offline evaluations using simulation data from the FGOALS‐f3‐L GCM confirm the superiority of the updated scheme, highlighting its potential to improve cloud fraction representation and associated climate effects in GCMs."

The large ensemble size (at least 10, and in many cases 50) allows for the isolation of weak signals that are usually hidden by internal variability. Increasing greenhouse gas concentrations lead to weakening of the Quasi‐biennial Oscillation (QBO) and an increased likelihood of a disruption event, with the effect most pronounced in the lower stratosphere. Increasing aerosols lead to a strengthening of the QBO. Explosive volcanic eruptions lead to a weakening, and for some phases also a stalling, of the QBO. Volcanic eruptions can also help trigger a QBO disruption. The ozone forcing used for LESFMIP helps synchronize the QBO phase across ensemble members, and also increases the strength of the QBO. Finally, the solar forcing has the smallest impact on the QBO of the five forcings. The large ensemble sizes also allow for exploring the QBO phases and the time of year most prone to a QBO disruption: disruptions preferentially occur around 8 months after the phase with easterlies near 50 hPa, and are most common in late boreal winter and early spring."

In addition to mineral dust, soil dust, and marine organics, laboratory and field measurements suggest biomass burning aerosols (BBA) can act as immersion‐mode INP between around −30°C and −15°C. However, the contribution of BBA to the global INP budget remains poorly understood due to poor knowledge of which fuels yield INPs, uncertainties in global coverage of those fuels, and unknown size distributions of the INPs in the BBA. Nonetheless, with some understanding of these uncertainties from sensitivity studies, the relative importance of ice nucleation activity of BBA compared to other INP sources can be quantified. In this work, we investigate the potential global importance of BBA as INP using a global aerosol‐climate model, specifically the UK Met Office Unified Model (UM). We evaluate the model using field campaign data sets. We examine potential uncertainties in fuel types and particle sizes on BBA‐based INP concentrations. Averaged over June–September between 15°S and 50°S, BBA is a more important INP than dust and marine INP about 30% of the time at altitudes with temperatures between −30°C and −20°C. Our simulations therefore suggest BBA INPs may be at least as important as mineral dust and marine INP over the atmospheric regions and seasons where grassland fires are frequent."

Previous studies have largely relied on empirical curve models, which have not been systematically validated against global‐scale observational fluxes. Here, we developed a process‐based bidirectional exchange model (GSEM) to predict global soil Hg0 emissions. The model incorporates key processes, including photochemical and non‐photochemical redox reactions, soil‐water partitioning, and gaseous diffusion. By constraining model outputs with global observations, we demonstrate that four mainstream empirical curve models underestimate air‐soil Hg0 exchange fluxes, while the GSEM model offers improved performance in replicating the fluxes and yields an improved global estimate of 2272.3 Mg yr−1. Emission hotspots are primarily concentrated in tropical regions such as the Amazon Basin, Central Africa, Southeast Asia, and East Asia, and the latitudinal variations in simulated fluxes closely align with global soil respiration patterns. This process‐based approach significantly enhances the accuracy of air‐soil Hg0 exchange predictions and contributes to reducing uncertainty in global Hg budget assessments."

In the United States, the level of surface ozone in many regions is close to the National Ambient Air Quality Standard, making it important to understand even small changes in emissions. Subsequently, model simulations of ozone are less tolerant of uncertainties in emission estimation, such as those caused by outdated emission updates. Here, we propose and assess four emission refresh methods: state‐level emission adjustment (ADJ), ADJ with budget‐aware urban adjustment (BA), ADJ with TROPOMI‐derived city emissions (SatNOx), and an approach with a machine learning product generated by Variational AutoEncorder (VAE). The observed temporal trends from ground measurements Air Quality System (AQS) and TROPOMI products are employed to provide updates of anthropogenic nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from a base year (2019) to the targeted model period (2020). The adjusted emissions effectively reflect the decrease in summer from 2019 to 2020. Comparisons of the ozone forecasts using the base and refreshed emission inputs show that the emission adjustments have reduced model mean biases by 19%–21% and enhanced the model's capability to forecast O3 surface concentrations. The nitrogen dioxide (NO2) predicted with updated emissions shows more underestimation at the surface and aloft due to lower baseline emissions. This work demonstrates the potential of using near‐real‐time ground and satellite observations to rapidly update emissions to reduce a key source of emission uncertainty in chemical transport modeling."

The Microwave Humidity Sounder‐II (MWHS‐II) aboard the FengYun‐3 satellite includes channels near both bands, offering complementary capabilities. Although the assimilation performances of instrument channels in these bands have been studied, their comparative impacts on hydrometeor fields remain insufficiently explored. Through the separate and joint assimilation of 118 and 183 GHz MWHS‐II channels using hydrometeor control variables, this study investigates how directly adjusting hydrometeor analysis for thermodynamic consistency influences the analysis and forecasting of Typhoon Lekima (2019). Results show that the 183 GHz band has higher sensitivity to solid hydrometeors at higher levels, whereas the 118 GHz band is more sensitive to liquid hydrometeors at lower levels. These differences are clearly manifested in the hydrometeor analysis. Joint assimilation of both sets of channels improves the representation of temperature, humidity, and hydrometeor distribution. This not only enhances the analysis and forecasting of typhoon intensity but also deepens the understanding of typhoon structure. In particular, the sensitivity of the 183 GHz band to solid hydrometeors provides valuable insights into their role in the secondary eyewall formation for Typhoon Lekima (2019). With the use of hydrometeor control variables, the synergistic assimilation of MWHS‐II channels demonstrates potential for advancing tropical cyclone analysis, forecasting, and understanding of dynamics."

This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the uncertainties in the simulated precipitation variability over dry and wet regions of China based on a 40‐year parameter‐perturbed ensemble spanning 1975 to 2014. The dynamic and thermodynamic contributions of physical parameters to precipitation variability are quantified. The results demonstrate that precipitation variability is mainly attributed to the change in the thermodynamic component of precipitation in China. However, the uncertain range of the dynamic component is comparable with that of the thermodynamic component, particularly at interannual timescale. Parametric sensitivity analyses suggest that at interdecadal timescale, most of the uncertainty in precipitation variability arises from internal model stochasticity. At interannual timescale, nearly 50% of the uncertainty is contributed by the parameter related to convective precipitation evaporation. Stronger convective precipitation evaporation rate simultaneously increases the dynamic and thermodynamic components of precipitation, suggesting the responses in the two components are tightly interconnected. The increased evaporation rate suppresses local convective precipitation but, via increasing low‐level water vapor and promoting remote moisture transport, strongly enhances large‐scale precipitation, leading to a net increase in total precipitation in convergence zones over tropical and subtropical monsoon regions and then enhancing upward motion in turn. Compared to drier years, stronger convergence in wetter years is more favorable for the long‐range transport of moisture to mid‐high latitudes, thereby enhancing precipitation interannual variability in China."

However, few studies have systematically explored the hierarchical drivers of SOC. This study addresses this gap by integrating multiple independent datasets—covering productivity, carbon allocation, carbon turnover, and carbon fractions—to construct a comprehensive framework for the hierarchical drivers shaping global SOC patterns. Using this framework, we examine the impact pathways and contributions of primary drivers. Our findings show that climate, as the fundamental primary driver, mainly influences SOC through carbon input pathways, while soil properties, as a secondary driver, predominantly affect SOC via carbon output pathways. Further analysis reveals that carbon input plays a key role in shaping topsoil SOC distribution, while carbon output is more influential in regulating subsoil SOC. In both cases, these drivers exert their effects primarily through stable organic carbon fractions, particularly mineral‐associated organic carbon (MAOC). The influence of these drivers on particulate organic carbon (POC), however, is in the opposite direction. This study provides the first quantification of the impact pathways and relative strengths of the hierarchical drivers shaping global SOC. It also underscores the need to consider the hierarchical structure of these drivers when assessing the magnitude, distribution, and dynamics of SOC, particularly in relation to its fractions."

However, the biophysical impacts of anthropogenic land use and land cover change (LULCC), particularly deforestation and afforestation, on extreme weather events in West Africa remain poorly understood at the regional scale. In this study, we present the first high‐resolution LULCC experiments (at 3 km resolution, covering 2012–2022) using the advanced fully coupled atmosphere‐hydrology WRF‐Hydro model system to assess the potential impacts of idealized land use and land management scenarios on extreme events in the West African savannah region. By analyzing 18 extreme weather indices, we show that deforestation significantly affects temperature extremes (up to 0.45 ± 0.04°C), with effects on regional rainfall extremes being approximately twice as pronounced as those on mean rainfall conditions, along with a significant increase in the number of dry days. Conversely, afforestation generally leads to increases in both mean and extreme precipitation, along with fewer dry days and shorter drought durations. Notably, afforestation produces contrasting responses in temperature extremes depending on vegetation type: converting grassland to mixed or evergreen forest reduces extreme heat via increased transpiration, while conversion to savanna or woody savanna may intensify heat extremes due to albedo‐induced warming effects."

However, there remains limited understanding of how air pollution levels modify these relationships across different regions and populations. This study employed a two‐stage, multi‐city time‐series analysis using data from 13 cities in Jiangsu Province (2015–2023) to explore these effects. A multistage analytical approach, including the distributed lag non‐linear model, multivariate meta‐regression, and attributable risk calculation, was used to quantify the association between climatic variables, air pollutants, and HFMD. Findings indicated that HFMD incidence is closely associated with meteorological conditions, with peak risk at 24.8°C for average temperature and 89.2% for average relative humidity. Low average wind speed and short sunshine hours (SH) also contributed to increased risk. Air pollutants, such as PM2.5, SO2, and O3, significantly modified these associations. For example, PM2.5 and SO2 increased HFMD risk at higher temperatures, while O3 reduced risk. Under low humidity, some pollutants exhibited protective effects, though risk increased with high humidity. NO2 had the strongest influence in reducing variability, while high PM2.5 and SO2 concentrations weakened the protective effects of SH. These findings emphasize the non‐linear influence of climatic variables on HFMD risk and suggest that air pollution's modification of these relationships varies by gender, age, and location.

 Structures that can be stimulated to change shape may be utilized for a variety of applications, but they frequently need to be processed and modified. We propose here a simple, straightforward strategy of actuation based on bipolar electrochemistry driving asymmetric reactions at the surface grooves of pristine carbon fibers. In the first set of proof-of-principle experiments, a free-standing carbon fiber is polarized in a closed bipolar cell to trigger asymmetric benzoquinone/hydroquinone redox reactions in the two distinct compartments. Beyond a particular threshold potential, ion transfer occurs, and the part of the fiber involved in the anodic reaction exhibits reversible directional motion. Elemental surface characterization of the polarized carbon fiber indicates that the deflection is due to the intercalation/deintercalation of ions accompanying the oxidation/reduction of the fiber. The simultaneous local surface ionic adsorption/desorption is responsible for the fiber deflection. The length of the fiber part exposed to the electrochemical reduction reaction in the opposite compartment of the closed bipolar cell, as well as the groove orientation, determines the motion’s intensity and direction, respectively. Effective bending is achieved by optimization of fiber alignment and stimuli parameters. Actuation of two parallel fibers, oriented in opposite directions, leads to microtweezer-type behavior. We anticipate that these results will enrich the tool case for research in the field of soft robotics and micromechanics.

 Limited identification of insulin resistance-associated loci hinders understanding of its role in cardiometabolic health, impeding therapeutic strategies. We apply three multivariate genome-wide association study approaches on homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance, insulin resistance index, fasting insulin, and ratio of triglycerides to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol from MAGIC and UK Biobank to develop a comprehensive phenotype (‘mvIR’), and identify 217 independent loci, including 24 novel loci. The mvIR is causally associated with higher risks of 17 cardiometabolic diseases and five aging phenotypes, independent of adiposity and sarcopenia. We outline 21 of 2644 druggable genes for insulin resistance by Mendelian randomization and colocalization, where six genes (AKT1, ERBB3, FCGR1A, FGFR1, LPL, NR1H3) encode targets for approved drugs with consistent directions in alleviating insulin resistance, with no significant side effects revealed by phenome-wide association study.

 Photocatalytic methanol dehydration to dimethyl ether (DME) offers a sustainable alternative to energy-intensive thermocatalysis, yet its practical application remains constrained by low efficiency. Herein, we designed Ni-doped plasmonic W18O49 nanowires that synergistically integrates low-coordinated W and Ni dual active sites with surface plasmon resonance for enhanced photocatalytic performance. The synergistic effect of W and Ni dual sites is amplified by plasmonic electron oscillations to facilitate the C-O bond cleavage and C-O-C coupling, driving efficient methanol-to-DME conversion. The optimized Ni0.66-W18O49 achieves a DME yield of 133.7 ± 3.3 mmol g-1 h-1 with 98.7% selectivity under 400 mW cm-2 illumination.

 Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) benefit some cancer patients but de novo resistance remains poorly understood. Analyzing transcriptional data from two clinical trial cohorts, GO30140 and IMbrave150, we find B cell lymphoma 9 (BCL9), a Wnt/β-catenin co-factor, associated with resistance. We develop a BCL9-targeting peptide, hsBCL9Z96, which suppresses tumor growth in combination with anti-PD-L1 ab in preclinical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mouse models. Multi-omics analyses implicate targeting BCL9 inhibits BMP4 secretion and downregulates CD24 on tumor cells, reprogramming macrophages toward a tumor-suppressive phenotype and promoting macrophage phagocytosis. This in turn rejuvenates T cell immunity via enhanced macrophage-mediated antigen presentation. Our data extend our understanding of how tumor-derived Wnt/β-catenin signaling impedes the innate and adaptive immune responses in the tumor microenvironment and provide preliminary evidence that targeting BCL9 is a promising preclinical strategy to mitigate ICI resistance in HCC.

Here the authors use sea surface height to show that a poleward shift of the northern boundary and changing dynamics maintain the circumpolar transport. 
 Over recent decades, the Southern Ocean’s westerly winds have intensified and shifted poleward, whereas the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) transport through the Drake Passage has remained stable. Here using satellite altimetry data, we define the interannual evolution of the ACC’s dynamical boundaries and identify a significant southward shift of its Northern Boundary (NB) over the past three decades, with the most rapid migration (up to 1.1° per decade) occurring in the Southeast Pacific. Ocean reanalysis confirms that volume transport within the ACC’s boundaries remains stable across the circumpolar Southern Ocean, despite a strengthening eastward flow concentrated near the migrating NB. The migrating NB redirects this intensified flow into the subtropical gyre, strengthening the Southern Ocean supergyre while maintaining stable ACC transport. These results resolve the paradox of stronger zonal flows coexisting with stable ACC transport, providing insight into changing Southern Ocean dynamics and their climate implications. Climate change is altering the strength and position of Southern Ocean westerly winds but the ocean transport is stable.

 Sea fog hampers coastal activities, yet its decadal variability in coastal China remains insufficiently characterized. Using hourly marine observations from the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS), we identify an April–July sea fog frequency (SFF) trend reversal over fog-prone eastern coastal China: from a decrease of 1% per decade (1980–2000) to an increase of 3% per decade (2001–2011) (p < 0.01 for both trends). Hourly ERA5 reanalysis corroborates this reversal and links it to enhanced 2001–2011 near‑surface cooling, which strengthens near-surface inversions and stability. Daily CMIP6 model simulations indicate that aerosols are the primary driver of the 2001–2011 SFF increase, enhancing stability through radiative cooling and promoting water vapor condensation by supplying cloud condensation nuclei.

 Summer precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) significantly affects the regional and global climate. In this paper, the orographic gravity wave drag (OGWD) parameterization is revised by incorporating the moisture effect of saturated air into the Weather Research and Forecasting model. Seasonal simulations are performed for the summer rainfall over the TP during 2003–2023 employing the original and modified OGWD schemes. The results indicate that the rainfall and thus the wet biases over the southeastern TP are reduced when the moist OGWD scheme is employed. The moisture effect first enhances the lower-tropospheric OGWD over the Indian Peninsula, thereby weakening the low-level winds. The decrease in the horizontal wind speed leads to a reduction of the surface gravity wave momentum flux and thus the OGWD, which in turn strengthens the low-level flow. The latter process initiates intensification of the monsoon circulation over the Bay of Bengal (BOB). During mid-to-late summer, the monsoon circulation is continuously intensified through the circulation–precipitation interaction. The enhanced cyclonic circulation over the BOB induces an easterly flow to the south of the TP, which is opposed to the climatological southwesterly monsoon circulation. Therefore, the water vapor transport toward the TP is decreased."

In contrast, during the positive impact period, Arctic geopotential height anomalies linked to ENSO generated positive anomalies in atmospheric heat and water vapor transport from mid-latitudes to the Arctic, consequently resulting in Arctic SAT warming. The varying responses of high-latitude atmospheric circulation to ENSO during different periods are key drivers of the reversal in the tropical-Arctic teleconnection, which is closely tied to changes in the climatic state of the westerly jet induced by SST under climate change. This study advances understanding of the interannual variability mechanism of Arctic spring climate in the context of climate change and offers new insights into improving predictive capabilities."

Keenlyside,AMOC weakening modulates global warming impacts on precipitation over Brazil,"AMOC weakening modulates global warming impacts on precipitation over Brazil 
 Global warming is expected to substantially weaken the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). However, climate models disagree greatly on the magnitude of AMOC weakening. This adds uncertainties in climate change projections, across the globe, through influencing poleward ocean and atmospheric energy transports. Here, we show through multi-model analysis of future climate change projections that AMOC weakening during this century will strongly influence precipitation and its extremes over Brazil. Such weakening dominates over the direct global warming impacts, causing drying in the Amazon, while completely mitigating them in northeast Brazil. We trace this to a tropical Atlantic warming, consistent with weakened heat transport along the southern branch of the South Equatorial Current. This induces a cross-equatorial sea surface temperature gradient and changes in latent heat flux, shifting the intertropical convergence zone southward. Our findings highlight the need to reduce uncertainties in the AMOC response to global warming and its oceanic mediated influences on Brazilian climate."

 Whether the tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) warming pattern under global warming resembles El Niño or La Niña remains uncertain, partly due to unrealistically simulated El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) asymmetry in climate models. Here, using a newly defined normalized mean state framework, we isolate the ENSO asymmetry-related rectification effect and find that traditional methods underestimate El Niño-like warming by 14.5% ± 11.9% because ENSO asymmetry weakens under global warming. This asymmetry reduction induces La Niña-like influences through cloud radiative and atmospheric convection processes in the equatorial western Pacific. The contribution of ENSO rectification to warming patterns correlates with simulated historical ENSO asymmetry in climate models. These findings clarify how ENSO nonlinearity shapes tropical Pacific warming patterns and provide an improved framework for climate projections."

 Warming and extreme precipitation events frequently occur in the Asian summer monsoon during autumn, and their causes are still unclear. In this study, we investigate variations in the monsoon and autumn precipitation over the Indochina Peninsula (ICP) using reanalysis data, observational datasets, and ensemble simulations from the CMIP6 Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project (PAMIP). The results show that from 2005 to 2023, a delayed retreat of the ICP monsoon led to increased autumn precipitation. Arctic sea ice loss associated with Arctic amplification is identified as one of the primary forcing factors. Reduced Arctic sea ice influences the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the tripole sea surface temperature (SST) pattern, which in turn excite Rossby wave sources in the mid-latitude North Atlantic. The resulting wave train propagates from Western Europe to Asia, inducing an anomalous anticyclone extending from Asia to the Western Pacific and promoting a northward displacement of the South Asian High (SAH). This shift drives a northward movement of the East Asian Subtropical Jet (EASJ) and the Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH). The SAH “pumping” enhances mid-tropospheric latent heat release and surface warming, strengthening the land–sea thermal contrast, thereby intensifying the monsoon circulation and delaying its retreat. These circulation changes enhance moisture convergence, increasing autumn precipitation over the ICP, highlighting the critical role of Arctic sea ice loss in modulating regional monsoon dynamics."

 The chaotic nature of the climate has motivated the production of large ensembles of simulations. To exploit those ensembles for impact or attribution studies, models are either considered separately or pooled together to increase the statistical significance of the results. The latter assumes that models are interchangeable. Care is necessary when fields, like temperature, yield obvious biases. Synoptic fields like SLP do not yield obvious biases, which might justify their use to enrich reanalysis data. Here, we examine this hypothesis through a neural network classification approach. The goal is to determine whether it is possible to recognize a climate model from a single SLP map over the North Atlantic. We find that models are highly identifiable in the summer (and less so in other seasons). From this classification, we identify families of climate models and investigate how climate change can affect SLP daily patterns toward the end of the 21st century.

Our analysis reveals that the wind-evaporation-sea surface temperature (SST) feedback is not the primary mechanism. Instead, the southward advection of the upper extratropical North Atlantic signal by the North Atlantic subtropical gyre along a horseshoe pathway is a key mechanism for forming the horseshoe pattern of cold SST anomalies. Additionally, the weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation changes the upper tropical North Atlantic western boundary current. This change is amplified by enhanced surface wind stress curl over the tropical North Atlantic, contributing to warmer tropical Atlantic subsurface thermocline temperature and SST in the tropical South Atlantic.

 Quantifying long-term historical changes in river runoff from the vulnerable high-mountain Third Pole is critical for Asia’s water resources planning, but still unresolved from a coherent, regional perspective in the climate change context. Here we show that the mountain-outlet runoff generally experienced significant increases for the westerlies-dominated rivers (Indus, Amu Darya, Syr Darya, Tarim, Heihe, and, Shule) and insignificant declines for the monsoon-dominated rivers (Ganges, Brahmaputra, Mekong, and Salween) in the past half-century, largely driven by the enhanced westerlies and weakened Indian summer monsoon. Although the changing rates of runoff can be mostly explained by the varying precipitation minus evapotranspiration, the total water storage changes (e.g., regional glacier melting, groundwater depletion) cannot be neglected. After the year 1997, the contrasting changes in the westerlies- and monsoon-dominated regions have been remarkably accelerated, necessitating proactive adaptations to sustain regional water, ecology, and food security.

 Wind energy plays a vital role in meeting rising electricity demand and climate goals, but its land-use footprints from vegetation removal, construction, and road sprawl may overestimate greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation benefits. Here we used life cycle assessment (LCA) to explore the land-use impacts on GHG emissions and energy performance for three typical wind farms located in forest, grassland and desert ecosystems. We incorporated vegetation/soil removal during the installation stage, and the loss of additional carbon sink capacity during the operation and maintenance stage. Land-use change (LUC) contributed 37.9% of the life cycle emissions for the forest farm, while much lower for the grassland and desert farm (4.3% and 1.2%, respectively). Grassland deployment offered a triple win with highest energy return, lowest land-use intensity, and lowest GHG emissions. With mitigation measures, all farms achieved low emission intensity (below 5 g CO2-eq kWh−1), greatly reducing land-use and ecosystem-based emission intensity differences.

 To understand magmatic processes within the silicate planets, accurate pressure and temperature estimates are essential. These conditions are often measured using thermobarometers based on mineral equilibria, but their precision is limited, particularly for barometers, with standard error estimates often exceeding 200 megapascals. Here we present an approach combining thermodynamics and statistics to rigorously investigate these uncertainties. Uncertainty propagation and Sobol analysis reveal that thermometer uncertainties are primarily driven by compositional analytical uncertainty, while barometer uncertainties are dominated by model parameters. Given the quality of current calibration data, even a perfect thermodynamic model has a built-in minimum uncertainty of 120–240 megapascals for barometer and 22–41 °C for thermometer. Furthermore, we demonstrate that pressure and temperature estimates are interdependent; an error in one inevitably compromises the other. Our work provides a pathway for building more reliable thermobarometric models and underscores the need for new, high-quality experimental data.

 Rapid Arctic warming accelerates the erosion of permafrost coasts rich in terrestrial organic carbon (terrOC). Once released into the ocean, terrOC can degrade or get buried in shelf sediments, yet its transport pathways and fate remain poorly understood.

Our results show that ~43% of terrOC is trapped in low-density fractions, mainly as vascular plant debris. Surprisingly, this material is trapped within shallow (0-5 m) waters where waterlogging and large particle size increase its density and settling velocity. Less than 10% is transported to deeper waters (30-55 m), indicating that the shallow coastal zone acts as a trap and biogeochemical reactor.

 The increasing frequency and severity of hydrological extremes demand the development of early warning systems and effective adaptation and mitigation strategies. Such systems and strategies require spatially detailed hydrological predictions, mostly provided by hydrological models. However, current state-of-the-art hydrological predictions remain limited in their spatial resolution. A proposed solution is the integration of high-resolution (<1 km) Earth observation (EO) products in hydrological modelling in order to reach hyper-resolution (approximately 1 km2). Nonetheless, proper use of these data in hydrological modelling requires a comprehensive characterization of their uncertainties. Here, we evaluate the performance of high-resolution EO products of four hydrological variables (7 precipitation products, 5 snow cover area products, 6 surface soil moisture products, and 6 actual evapotranspiration products) against observational references. Two merged EO precipitation products at 1 km resolution (merged IMERG-SM2A and merged ERA5-IMERG-SM2A) reached correlation coefficients >0.5 with the benchmark reference over most areas and are recommended for hyper-resolution hydrological modelling over Europe. The MODIS (resolution of 250 m) and Sentinel-2/Landsat-8 (resolution of 20/30 m) snow cover products showed the highest classification accuracy and were selected as the best choice for the use of snow cover area products in hyper-resolution hydrological modelling. For surface soil moisture, the NSIDC SMAP product at 1 km resolution yielded correlation coefficients >0.6 at most stations and is recommended for hyper-resolution hydrological modelling. Finally, evapotranspiration products showed similar performances at the selected flux sites (correlations coefficients > 0.8). While the MODIS-Terra/Aqua evapotranspiration products (MOD16A2/MYD16A2) offer higher spatial resolution (500 m), making them potentially advantageous for hyper-resolution hydrological modelling, their temporal resolution is coarser (8-day intervals). In contrast, products like ETMonitor (1 km), ALEXI, and HOLAPS (5 km) provide daily estimates, albeit at lower spatial resolution.

 Many commodity crops have growth stages during which they are particularly vulnerable to stress-induced yield loss. In-season crop progress information is useful for quantifying crop risk, and satellite remote sensing (RS) can be used to track progress at regional scales. At present, all existing RS-based crop progress estimation (CPE) methods which target crop-specific stages rely on ground truth data for training/calibration. Such data are collected via field trials or surveys. This reliance on ground survey data confines CPE methods to surveyed regions, limiting their utility. In this study, a new method is developed for conducting RS-based in-season CPE in unsurveyed regions by combining data from surveyed regions with synthetic crop progress data generated for an unsurveyed region of interest. Corn-growing zones in Argentina were used as surrogate ‘unsurveyed’ regions. These zones have climates and dual planting systems which differ from the single planting system in the US Midwest – the surveyed region in this study. Existing weather generation, crop growth, and optical radiative transfer models were linked to produce synthetic weather, crop progress, and canopy reflectance data. These data mimic weather, cultivars, and cropping practices in the unsurveyed region. A neural network (NN) method based upon bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory was trained separately on surveyed data, synthetic data, and two different combinations of surveyed and synthetic data. In the absence of real validation data in unsurveyed regions, a stopping criterion was developed which uses the weighted divergence of surveyed and synthetic data validation loss. F1 score was modified to measure CPE accuracy when the NN was trained on each data combination, with scores based on over- and under-estimates of crop progress throughout the season. Including synthetic data during training improved performance in 9 out of 11 corn-growing zones in Argentina. Net F1 scores across all crop progress stages increased by 8.7% when trained on a combination of surveyed region and synthetic data, and overall performance was only 21% lower than when the NN was trained on surveyed data and applied in the US Midwest. Performance gain from synthetic data was greatest in zones with dual planting windows, while the inclusion of surveyed region data from the US Midwest helped mitigate NN sensitivity to noise in NDVI data. Overall results suggest in-season CPE in other unsurveyed regions may be possible with increased quantity and variety of synthetic crop progress data."

 Operational national forest monitoring requires frequent, reliable observations for timely detection of deforestation and other forest changes. However, tropical forests, which encompass all current major deforestation fronts, are often hampered by persistent cloud cover. While radar remote sensing offers a compelling complement to optical data, a significant research gap remains in distinguishing the strengths and limitations of different radar sensors to the multiple stages of forest disturbance. Given the impending rapid expansion of available data outside the C band, it is imperative to assess the ability of these sensors to rapidly and accurately detect changes of high importance to the remote sensing community.To address this gap, we investigated the sensitivity of two freely available radar datasets — JAXA’s ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 (L-band) and ESA’s Sentinel-1 (C-band) — to distinct stages of tropical forest loss. With a particular focus on detecting the earliest stage of deforestation, we compared backscatter values, SAR indices, and statistical metrics against time series data from 92 locations over three years in the Amazon. In these locations, early deforestation, biomass burning, and vegetation regrowth were occurring in different stages of the full conversion process. Our analysis revealed that the L-band-derived Radar Forest Degradation Index (RFDI) is highly sensitive to early deforestation, even when biomass remains on the ground soon after cutting. In contrast, C-band information showed limited ability to sense this critical initial stage of change, but was much stronger at detecting later deforestation stages. Our results point the way toward combining information from the upcoming L-Band NISAR mission with the existing C-band information to produce a multi-component system that can accurately detect deforestation in all its temporal stages."

 Spatiotemporal fusion is recognized as a feasible approach for reconstructing high spatiotemporal resolution remote sensing imagery. The recently proposed ROBust OpTimization-based (ROBOT) fusion model has attracted attention for its efficiency, accuracy, and simple parameterization, and has been applied to seamless global data cube reconstruction. However, its sliding-window strategy often leads to block artifacts, while cloud contamination in auxiliary images further degrade the reconstruction quality and reliability. To address these limitations, this study proposes an improved version of ROBOT (iROBOT). By replacing fixed rectangular patches with spectrally and spatially homogeneous segments, iROBOT effectively suppresses block artifacts and better preserves structural details. In addition, an adaptive gap-filling strategy is applied to temporally nearest auxiliary images prior to fusion, and a low-quality information detection module is introduced to filter unreliable cloud-contaminated data from the regression and residual allocation steps, thereby enhancing reliability under cloud contamination. A total of 28 experiments conducted across two representative areas demonstrate that iROBOT consistently outperforms ROBOT, OL-HSTFM, and FSDAF under both cloud-free and cloud-contaminated scenarios. Moreover, compared with ROBOT, iROBOT exhibits superior capability in selecting reliable information from multi-temporal auxiliary images, with its accuracy advantage becoming more pronounced as the number of auxiliary inputs increases, and with notably enhanced robustness in cloud-prone environments. These findings highlight the potential of iROBOT for improving the accuracy of global-scale spatiotemporal image reconstruction.

 Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a powerful proxy for vegetation photosynthesis. However, its broader application remains constrained by the insufficient understanding and quantification of canopy spatial heterogeneity. We used the 3D discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model to simulate SIF. Heterogeneous and homogeneous canopies were compared to quantify the impact of canopy spatial configuration on total leaf-emitted SIF (SIFtotal) and hemispherically integrated top-of-canopy SIF (SIFhemi). Angular effects were examined by comparing top-of-canopy SIF (SIFtoc) with SIFtotal estimated at different viewing angles. We also compared the relationships of simulated SIFtotal and SIFtoc with fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) and vegetation indices (VIs). In addition, we evaluated the relationships between the coefficient of variation (CV) of VIs and SIF, and developed a correction function for estimating heterogeneous-canopy SIF using homogeneous-canopy SIF. The results reveal that (1) both SIFtotal and SIFhemi are significantly higher in homogeneous than in heterogeneous canopies; (2) estimating SIFtotal from SIFtoc effectively reduces angular dependency; (3) SIFtotal exhibits the strongest correlation with fAPAR, while SIFtoc aligns better with NIRv and EVI; and (4) VI-derived CVs are negatively correlated with SIF, with CVNIRv and CVEVI at 10 m resolution demonstrating robust performance in fitting the ratio of heterogeneous-to-homogeneous canopy SIF, validating the proposed correction function. This study highlights the critical role of canopy structural heterogeneity in shaping SIF and presents an approach to convert homogeneous-canopy SIF to heterogeneous-canopy conditions, offering a novel pathway toward more accurate SIF estimation and application."

 Vegetation optical depth (VOD) based on microwave remote sensing has become an essential indicator for monitoring large-scale vegetation conditions. The relatively long-term record of satellite-based passive C-band observations offers the potential for assessing dynamic vegetation changes. Due to the limited operational lifetime of individual microwave sensors, retrieving a long-term C-band VOD (C-VOD) dataset often requires combining multiple sensors, such as Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS Aqua (AMSR-E, 2002–2011), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2, 2012–present) and WindSat (2003–2020). Retrieving a long-term C-VOD from their C-band brightness temperature (TB) observations faces two major challenges: (i) non-negligible systematic biases exist between the TB observations among the three sensors; (ii) TB from different sensors may not be strongly associated, especially in tropical forests with small seasonal variations. To address these challenges, we employed a combined inter-calibration method, using linear regression in sparse vegetation and linear rescaling in dense vegetation, to merge TB from three sensors. Results showed that: (i) in undisturbed dense forests where minimal emissivity variation can be assumed, the merged TB (2002–2022) exhibited strong temporal correlations with skin temperature (H polarization: R = 0.90, V polarization: R = 0.86); (ii) the merged C-VOD retrieved from the merged TB exhibited substantially improved temporal consistency across three sensors, reducing global discrepancies between AMSR-E and AMSR2 from 6.20 % to 0.34 %. Furthermore, the merged C-VOD showed stable long-term consistency across sensors, with paired t-tests indicating no significant differences (P-value > 0.01) at the global and vegetation-type scales, confirming reliable cross-sensor continuity; (iii) the merged C-VOD showed stronger temporal correlations with normalized difference vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, and site-level gross primary production across more vegetated areas globally, and exhibited higher and more stable spatial correlations with vegetation variables across sensor transitions compared to the existing merged C-VOD product."

 Accurate paddy rice cropping intensity (PRCI) information is crucial for yield estimation, food policy formulation, and water resources management. However, the high cultivation intensity, fragmented farmland, complex crop rotation systems, and overlapping crop growth stages in southern China make it challenging to differentiate rice varieties from other crops.

Then, an automated division approach is designed to divide crop-growing seasons. Based on that, we developed a discriminant feature set for rice and identified potential rice-planting regions using an unsupervised Gaussian mixture model. Finally, we obtained reliable 10-m PRCI maps from PRP regions by integrating statistical data, Sentinel-1 data, limited rice samples, and the time-weighted dynamic time warping algorithm.

 In Europe, a large proportion of the population lives in industrial and urban coastal areas, due to their role as hubs of population migration and economic activity. Despite regulatory efforts, these areas frequently experience PM10 and PM2.5 pollution episodes due to the high density of emission sources combined with complex atmospheric dynamics. In this context, we investigate pollution days (PDs) over a 4-year period (2018–2021) on the Great Dunkirk Area, a coastal region significantly affected by diverse pollution sources. We show that PM2.5 pollution plumes predominantly exhibit regional extension, while PM10 plumes are more often local, with clear seasonal patterns. Using SEM-EDX analysis of over 23,000 individual particles collected during the 2021 MIXTAPE campaign, we reveal a highly heterogeneous aerosol composition, dominated by sea salt and carbonaceous particles, with fine particles enriched in sulfur secondary species and coarse particles in calcium. The mixing state index (χ) ranges from 0.5 to 0.9, indicating a continuum from external to internal mixtures, strongly influenced by atmospheric ageing, recirculation, and turbulent mixing. Our results highlight that neither local wind direction nor plume extension alone can explain the observed chemical variability. Instead, the evolution of particle composition and mixing state depends on fine-scale meteorological dynamics including sea breezes and recirculation periods affecting pollutant dispersion and ageing. This work underlines the need to incorporate high-resolution particle chemistry and urban-scale atmospheric dynamics in air quality assessments and demonstrates the added value of single-particle analysis in complex, multisource coastal environments."

 In indoor environments, the presence of particulate matter promotes SVOCs volatilization, increasing their overall concentration in the air. This effect arises from the partition of SVOCs between the gas and particulate phases. The particle-gas partition ratio (Kp) is a critical parameter influencing the fate, transport, and human exposure to indoor SVOCs. Air exchange rate (AER) is a pivotal factor in closed spaces as it regulates the residence time of airborne SVOCs in an indoor environment. It has been reported that AER (or residence time) can affect particle-gas partitioning behavior for organic particles when equilibrium between gas and particle phases is not reached; however, its effect on inorganic particles has not been thoroughly investigated. This study develops an experimental procedure to measure Kp of Di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP) and Diethyl phthalate (DEP) with inorganic sodium chloride (NaCl) particles. Results shows that DnBP had higher Kp values than DEP. Positive correlation of Kp values and mixing time was observed. These findings are consistent with model predictions. Further experiments were carried out to study the impact of AER on Kp, and the results shown that higher air exchange rates (lower residence time) result in lower particle-phase concentrations of SVOCs due to increased dilution and reduced interaction time with particles. These findings have important implications for indoor air quality assessments, highlighting the influence of ventilation strategies on SVOCs behavior in indoor environments."

 Particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter equal to or less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) remains a serious issue in Asia. To address the lack of observational data and investigate the status of PM2.5 in the forests, we collected PM2.5 above a tropical dry deciduous forest in a remote area of northeastern Thailand during the dry season. Notably, a large-scale surface fire occurred at the forest site during the mid-dry season. We also analyzed the PM2.5 data collected by the Pollution Control Department of Thailand and the satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) over Southeast Asia. Three episodes of elevated PM2.5 concentration were observed at the site. Based on the ground-based measurements and AOD, two episodes were attributable to the long-range transport from urban areas in Vietnam and Thailand. The proportion of SO42− increased in the two episodes, indicating SO42− was a key indicator for identifying the sources of air pollution. While NH4+, NO3−, and SO42− dominated approximately 83 % of the total concentration of water-soluble inorganic ions (WSII) during the non-fire periods, the forest fire substantially altered the chemical composition, with K+ and Cl− accounting for approximately 42 %. The maximum concentration of total WSII in PM2.5 during the forest fire period reached 88.0 μg m−3, which was approximately three times higher than that during the non-fire periods (26.4 μg m−3). The forest site served not only as a receptor of urban air pollution but also as a large source of PM2.5. Enhancing regional cooperation and forest management is necessary in this region."
10.1016/j.atmosenv.2025.121674,True,Atmospheric Environment,该研究论文关注的是京津冀地区空气污染和二氧化碳排放的协同效应及其驱动因素。它利用高分辨率排放清单和WRF-CAMx模型来量化不同部门对二氧化碳排放以及PM2.5和O3浓度的贡献。研究通过污染控制效率、弹性系数和耦合协调度等指标，系统评估了协同效应，并结合地理探测器分析和计量经济学模型揭示了这些协同效应的驱动机制。虽然没有直接提及遥感技术，但其对空气污染物（如PM2.5和臭氧）的监测和排放清单的依赖，暗示了遥感数据在支持排放清单编制和验证中的潜在应用，因此与大气环境遥感技术具有一定的相关性。,"['air pollution', 'carbon emissions', 'PM2.5', 'ozone', 'emission inventories', 'air quality monitoring']",Min Dong;Wenjiao Duan;Shuiyuan Cheng;Chuanda Wang;Xiaosong Hou,Synergistic effects and their driving factors of air pollution and carbon emissions in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region during 2018–2022,"•Contributions of different sources and their synergies are quantified. •Driving factors and driving effects of synergies are explored. •Synergies and drivers exhibit spatiotemporal and sectoral heterogeneity. •Technological innovation and population have significant impacts on synergies. •Total energy consumption and energy intensity are key drivers of synergies. 
 Investigating the synergistic effects of air pollution and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their influencing factors is crucial for developing more scientific environmental governance and climate change mitigation strategies. This study investigated spatiotemporal patterns of air pollutants and CO2 emissions in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region during two distinct phases (2018–2020 and 2020–2022). Through integration of high-resolution emission inventories with WRF-CAMx modeling, sectoral contributions to CO2 emissions and to PM2.5 and O3 concentrations were quantified. A systematic assessment of synergistic effects employed three metrics: pollution control efficiency, elasticity coefficients, and coupling coordination degree. Finally, geographic detector analysis combined with econometric modeling revealed driving mechanisms underlying these synergistic effects, incorporating spatial correlations and causal inference. The results indicated a continuous decline in air pollutants and CO2 emissions across most cities in the BTH region from 2018 to 2022, with notable heterogeneity in the synergistic effects contributed by different sectors. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and CO2 exhibited stronger synergistic effects compared to ozone (O3) and CO2. These effects were positively influenced by population size and negatively impacted by energy consumption intensity. Total standard energy consumption and energy consumption intensity had relatively greater influences. Furthermore, there were interaction effects between different influencing factors, including two-factor enhancement and nonlinear enhancement. This study provided valuable scientific insights for enhancing the synergistic management of environmental pollution alleviation and carbon emission control in future phases, and offered strategic guidance for more effective integration of air quality improvement and climate change mitigation efforts."

 The Himalayan glacier valleys are encountering escalating environmental challenges. One of the contributing factors is thought to be the rising amounts of light-absorbing carbonaceous aerosols, particularly brown carbon (BrC) and black carbon (BC), that are reaching glacier valleys. The present study examines the optical and radiative characteristics of BC at Bhojbasa, near Gaumukh (∼3800amsl). Real-time in-situ BC data, optical characteristics, radiative forcing, heating rate, several meteorological parameters, and BC transport pathways to this high-altitude site are investigated. The daily mean concentration of equivalent black carbon (eBC) was 0.28 ± 0.21 μg/m3 over the research period, and the eBC from fossil fuel (BCFF) is dominant with 78 % with a daily mean of 0.22 ± 0.19 μg/m3, and eBC from biomass burning (BCBB) is 22 % with a daily mean of 0.06 ± 0.08 μg/m3. Meteorological data, Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) imaging, and backward air-mass trajectory analysis demonstrate the presence of BC particles and their plausible transit pathways from multiple source locations to the pristine Gangotri Glacier Valley. The estimated daily mean BC radiative forcing values are +6.71 ± 1.80 W/m2 in the atmosphere, +1.87 ± 1.16 W/m2 at the top of the atmosphere, and −4.84 ± 1.01 W/m2 at the surface with a corresponding atmospheric heating rate of 0.19 ± 0.05 K/day. These findings highlight the critical role of ground-based measurements in monitoring the fluctuations of BC over such varied Himalayan terrain, as they offer important information on the localized trends and effects. Long-term measurements of glacier valleys are essential for a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of BC particles on Himalayan ecology and climate."

10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108620,False,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文主要关注中国地区湿热浪的强度和变化趋势。它使用均一化的湿球温度数据，通过累积强度来量化湿热浪的严重程度。研究发现，经过均一化处理后，湿热浪的强度显著增加，尤其是在1990年之后。论文强调了观测数据均一化对于准确评估湿热浪风险的重要性。虽然该研究涉及大气温度和湿度的分析，但它主要侧重于气候变化和极端天气事件的影响，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）的直接关联较弱。,"['wet-bulb temperature', 'humid heatwaves', 'homogenized data', 'cumulative intensity', 'air temperature', 'relative humidity']",Linghong Chen;Hongze Cai;Changjian Yin;Kaicun Wang,Stronger rise in humid heatwaves over China shown by homogenized data from 1961 to 2022,"•A homogenized, high-resolution (0.1° × 0.1°) wet-bulb temperature dataset is used to quantified humid heatwaves. •Humid heatwave severity is characterized using cumulative intensity, demonstrating higher positive trend (1.71 °C/decade) than unhomogenized heatwave (1.29 °C/decade). •After homogenization, the humid heatwave severity increased by 26.6 % during 2010–2022. 
 A growing body of evidence has established the intensification of global humid heatwaves. With a large population and diverse ecosystem, humid heatwave in China has garnered scientific attention. Divergent conclusions across previous research of humid heatwave severity stem from the variations in wet-bulb temperature data source and heatwave characteristics. Robust wet-bulb temperature with high spatiotemporal resolution and cumulative heatwave characteristics, would enable more consistent assessments of humid heatwaves. Here, we generate regular gridded data of wet-bulb temperature, based on homogenized air temperature and relative humidity from station observational records across China. Meanwhile, we propose a cumulative heatwave intensity characteristic to quantify humid heatwaves severity, with inter-annual and cross-regional comparisons. The homogenized cumulative intensity characteristic reveals a significant increasing trend from 1961 to 2022. The national time-averaged value of the cumulative intensity during 1990–2022 (8.11 °C) exceeds twice the value of 1961–1990 (2.94 °C). The analysis identifies the Tibetan Plateau and Northwestern China as hotspots for humid heatwaves. These regions exhibit both higher multi-year mean severity and stronger intensification trends. The homogenization procedure reveals more extensive regions across China exhibiting both stronger and statistically significant intensification trends in heatwave severity. Additionally, the homogenized national mean trend of cumulative intensity of humid heatwave (1.71 °C/decade) surpass that derived from unhomogenized data (1.29 °C/decade). The cumulative intensity of humid heatwaves exhibits considerable discrepancy after homogenization, especially in post-1990. The relative discrepancy reaches 26.6 % during 2010–2022, while partial homogenization of temperature contributes − 9.3 %, partial homogenization of relative humidity contributes 48.0 %. This study investigates the rapid intensification of humid heatwaves across China under global warming, while highlighting how observational inhomogeneity systematically underestimate associated risks."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108626,False,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文主要关注华北雨季期间的强降水特征以及NCEP S2S模型的预测能力。论文将华北地区的强降水分为两类，并分析了不同类型强降水形成的原因，以及NCEP S2S模型对不同类型强降水的预测技巧。研究发现，模型对第一类强降水（集中在京津冀地区）的预测技巧较低，主要是因为模型未能准确预测西太平洋副热带高压（WPSH）的北抬。而对于第二类强降水（发生在华北南部），模型具有较高的预测技巧，这归因于其能够预测南亚高压（SAH）的东伸。该研究与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关联，主要侧重于气象学和气候预测。,"['heavy rainfall', 'North China rainy season', 'precipitation forecast', 'WPSH', 'SAH', 'NCEP S2S model']",Ting Zheng;Zhihai Zheng;Peiyi Fan;Xintong Hou;Guolin Feng,The characteristics of heavy rainfall during the rainy season over North China and prediction skill of NCEP S2S,"•The heavy rainfall in North China are divided into two types: one type is concentrated in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, while the other occurs in southern North China. •The first type of heavy rainfall is mainly due to the PJ pattern strengthening the WPSH. The second type is due to the eastward extension of the SAH. •The low forecast skill of the NCEP S2S for the first type is primarily because the model fails to predict the WPSH. The model exhibits higher forecasting skill for the second type and the SAH. 
 The North China region is one of the most core areas in China. Understanding the characteristics of heavy precipitation during the North China rainy season is of great significance for predicting and preventing flood disasters in this region. Precipitation in North China in 2024 ranked fourth in the past 45 years. Therefore, we conducted a study of the precipitation in North China in 2024 and found that the precipitation anomaly center was located in the eastern part of North China. Based on this, we conducted an analysis of the distribution characteristics of heavy rainfall of North China and found that it can be divided into two types: one type of heavy rainfall is concentrated in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, while the other occurs in southern North China. Heavy rainfall concentrated in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region is mainly due to the descending branch of the Pacific-Japan (PJ) pattern coinciding with the center of the Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH), thereby strengthening the northward-jumping WPSH. The low forecast skill of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Sub-seasonal to Seasonal (S2S) model for the first type of heavy rainfall is primarily because the model fails to predict the northward shift of the WPSH, leading to a southern bias in the forecasted anomaly center. Heavy rainfall occurring in the southern part of North China is due to the eastward extension of the eastern boundary of the South Asian High (SAH), which brings a large amount of moisture and strengthens the WPSH. The NCEP S2S model exhibits modestly higher forecasting skill for the second type of heavy rainfall compared to the first, attributed to its ability to predict the eastward extension of the SAH. The 2024 precipitation anomaly in North China aligns more closely with a hybrid of the first and second rainfall types. This pattern correlates with an unusually intense and northward-displaced WPSH, coupled with an exceptionally eastward-extended eastern boundary of the SAH. Consequently, the model successfully predicted the precipitation anomaly in southeastern North China but exhibited limited skill in forecasting anomalies across the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region."

 Under global warming, the change of lightning activity is a controversial issue. This study investigates historical trends in lightning over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) based on 18-years lightning data detected by optical transient detector (OTD) and lightning imaging sensor (LIS). Local and remote meteorological factors from reanalysis datasets are used to analyze the primary parameters controlling the change of lightning activity. To explore the proxy of lightning flash density over the TP, we employed multiple linear regression through k-fold cross validation. Furthermore, future projections of lightning activity are examined based on outputs of climate models from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6). Historical analysis reveals that flash density over the eastern TP has shown consistently positive trends with a significant increase at a rate of 0.064 fl km−2y−2 over the entire observation period. Our ensemble model mean indicates that sea surface temperature of northwest of Australia and local surface temperature are closely related to the interannual variations in lightning activity over the eastern TP, accounting for 67 % of the variation in flash density. By applying the developed regional proxy to climate models, our projections suggest that lightning activity will increase by 32 % under SSP1–2.6 scenario and by 60 % under SSP2–4.5 scenario by the end of this century."
