10.1088/1748-9326/ae1622,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注美国都市地区蔬菜种植本地化对环境的影响，特别是对地下水超采和肥料相关的PM2.5排放的影响。虽然提到了PM2.5排放，但这主要是作为农业活动（如施肥）的副产品来考虑的，而不是直接利用大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测、大气成分分析）来研究大气环境。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强，更侧重于农业和土地利用的环境影响。,"['PM2.5 emissions', 'fertilizer', 'groundwater overdraft']",Peter Nixon;Anu Ramaswami,Quantifying US metropolitan level environmental burdens & benefits from greater localization of vegetable farming,"Several US urban food action plans propose increasing local and regional vegetable production for the presumed environmental and nutritional benefits. However, such efforts, if applied nationwide, can propagate environmental benefits or disbenefits to other geographies that have not been previously evaluated. Our paper quantifies the environmental benefits and disbenefits at the metropolitan scale nationwide from various localization scenarios ranging in scope (e.g., meeting 25%–100% of local vegetable dietary demand through local production). For the first time, these localization targets are modeled nationwide with consistent methodology across 378 metropolitan areas, considering three different land reutilization scenarios: (1) shifting current commodity cropland to vegetables, (2) leveraging marginal urban land, and (3) a novel strategy of repurposing parking lots and roads, anticipating the future deployment of shared autonomous vehicle fleets. These scenarios, implemented nationwide, diffusing current, concentrated vegetable production, are evaluated in the context of land availability constraints and two critical environmental burdens: groundwater overdraft and fertilizer-related PM2.5 emissions. Broadly across the conterminous US metros, scenarios find few significant land constraints and reveal net environmental benefits to both groundwater overdraft and fertilizer-related PM2.5 emissions in 11%–55% of metros (scenario-dependent). The model also reveals where relocalization of vegetable farming would exacerbate existing environmental vulnerabilities. Such spatially disaggregated nationwide urban agriculture localization models can inform environmentally friendly urban agricultural planning across US metro regions."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae1f2a,False,Environmental Research Letters,该论文主要关注经济发展、空调普及与气候变暖适应之间的关系。它探讨了经济增长如何通过提高空调的使用来减少高温带来的负面影响。论文提出了一个“制冷不足指数”，用于衡量在没有空调的情况下暴露于高温的人口比例。研究发现，低收入国家的人口在没有空调的情况下经历高温天数的可能性最大，并且随着全球气温升高，这些天数可能会进一步增加。虽然论文提到了全球气温升高，但其重点在于经济和社会因素对气候变化适应的影响，而非大气环境遥感技术的应用，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,[],Alicia Wongel;Lyssa M Freese;Edgar Virgüez;Steven J Davis;Ken Caldeira,"Economic development, air conditioning and adaptation to warming","Rising global temperatures increase the potential for heat-related adverse impacts, while economic growth, by enabling greater adoption of air conditioning, can help reduce them. This makes it unclear in which countries the net effect will lead to a worsening or easing of these potential impacts as the climate and economies change. We define a Cooling Deficit Index as the product of cooling degree days and the fraction of the population without air conditioning to indicate the extent to which high temperatures are experienced without access to cooling. We used this index to investigate the relationship between global warming, economic growth, and the fraction of population exposed to high temperatures without the benefits of air conditioning. We find that populations in lower-income countries tend to experience the greatest number of high-temperature days without access to cooling and are likely to face the largest increases in such days as global temperatures rise. These countries would require GDP growth rates that exceed historical rates to avoid increasing numbers of days with high temperatures experienced without air conditioning. Reducing or reversing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing economic growth, and lowering the cost of cooling technologies could all contribute to decreasing the number of days with high temperatures experienced without air conditioning, particularly in low-income countries."

Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a leading global health risk. Latin American cities exhibit some of the world’s highest urban PM2.5 levels, yet studies of neighborhood-level PM2.5 exposure and associated disparities in the region are limited. Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional ecological analysis of 53 041 neighborhoods across 340 cities in eight Latin American countries, leveraging the Salud Urbana en America Latina study dataset. Annual PM2.5 concentrations were derived from satellite data and linked to socioeconomic and urban characteristics. A multilevel model analyzed associations between neighborhood PM2.5 levels and neighborhood- and city-level characteristics. Results. The median annual neighborhood PM2.5 concentration was 18.49 µg m−3. Of the 256 million residents, all lived in neighborhoods with ambient PM2.5 concentrations that exceeded the 2021 World Health Organization guidelines (5 µg m−3). Variability was greatest between cities (54.3% of total variance), but substantial within-city variation (26% of variance) was observed. Higher neighborhood PM2.5 levels were associated with higher neighborhood educational attainment (mean difference [MD] comparing top to bottom tertile = 0.17 µg m−3), higher neighborhood intersection density (MD comparing top to bottom tertile = 0.17 µg m−3), and older cities (MD comparing top to bottom tertile = 1.45 µg m−3). Lower neighborhood PM2.5 levels were related to higher neighborhood population density (MD comparing top to bottom tertile = − 0.55 µg m−3), more greenness (MD comparing top to bottom tertile = − 0.76 µg m−3), and larger distance from city centers (MD comparing top to bottom tertile = − 0.86 µg m−3). Conclusions. Neighborhoods with higher PM2.5 concentrations tended to have higher educational attainment, more intersections, and be located in older cities, while lower concentrations were associated with denser populations, more green space, and greater distance from city centers. Our findings reveal important within-city heterogeneity in PM2.5 and the factors associated with it, suggesting strategies to mitigate air pollution within cities."

To address this gap, we present a new framework to predict farm-level direct emission intensities (tCO2e/£) from a minimal set of input variables. Our approach leverages a unique and comprehensive dataset that integrates survey based GHG audits from 482 farms across the United Kingdom (UK) with financial transaction data, obtained through a collaboration with a major high-street bank and a leading UK charity promoting sustainable agriculture. By combining granular farm-level emissions metrics with financial records, we demonstrate that a limited set of input variables focused on the highest impact areas—particularly dairy and beef cattle intensities—yield robust predictions that can explain up to 91% of the variation in farm-level emissions. Although this model does not replace the depth and specificity of established carbon calculators, it provides a pragmatic, scalable alternative for emissions reporting. It offers farms a clear entry-point to carbon accounting and provides financial institutions with a data-efficient method for more accurate assessments of the environmental impact of their agricultural portfolios."

Large-scale assessments of soil organic carbon development in arable land are affected by the scarcity of reliable time series of soil organic carbon monitoring data and often fail to replicate observed trends or appreciate any effects induced by changes in soil management. This study quantifies C loss from contemporary soil management on specialist crop farms in the EU and the potential societal benefits from C sequestration and avoided C loss due to improved management. Our analysis is based on an evidence pool of 214 independent long-term time series of soil organic carbon measurements spanning a wide range of climatic conditions and soil types, and considers the implementation of reduced tillage, organic amendments, soil cover during winter, and crop rotations. Overall, we estimate the potential for C sequestration from improved soil management on specialist crop farms, representing 40% of all the arable land in the EU, to be 48 ( 15) million tonnes CO2 equivalents yearly, which corresponds to 17% ( 8) of the target for additional carbon removals in the soil and forest sinks under the Fit for 55 package. In addition, our results show high spatial variability in C losses due to current soil management practices and potential C sequestration from improvements. The annual climate-change mitigation value per unit of land with improved management shows a four-fold variation across countries, with Finland exhibiting the highest value and Cyprus the lowest. This demonstrates that a C payment eco-scheme should be adjusted spatially to achieve cost-effective soil organic carbon sequestration in arable soils in the EU."

Through a integration of satellite data and in-situ bio-optical measurements, we reveal a counterintuitive ecological response to TC ‘Chaba’ in 2022 that challenges conventional understanding. While satellite-detected Chla concentrations increased and phytoplankton division rates accelerated following TC passage, we surprisingly documented simultaneous declines in phytoplankton biomass and carbon-to-chlorophyll (C:Chl) ratios. Our analysis demonstrates that physiological regulation, rather than biomass accumulation, dominated high-Chla zones during and after TC disturbance, with C:Chl anomalies contributing over 60% to elevated Chla areas. This research presents a paradigm-shifting scenario: phytoplankton biomass began accumulating initiated pre-TC, yet increased loss rates during/after TC actually reduced phytoplankton biomass despite enhanced division rates. The fundamental decoupling between TC-induced Chla enhancement and phytoplankton biomass dynamics we document has profound implications for oceanic carbon cycling models and climate predictions, necessitating a recalibration of how we interpret satellite Chla signals in storm-affected marine ecosystems."

Over the past five decades, flood inundation models have emerged as essential tools for flood forecasting and risk management. Through an analysis of publications from 1970 to 2023, this review provides a foundational understanding of state-of-the-science flood model developments. The evolution of flood models in recent decades has been marked by significant technological advances, including enhancing traditional numerical modeling approaches and deploying them with widespread use of large-scale simulation and satellite remote sensing. The field has matured substantially over the past 50 years, and it seems to have reached an inflection point at which major research is poised to progress. The most ambitious research directions are those that involve coupling flood models with models in diverse fields and involve: (1) atmospheric sciences to construct a two-way coupled flood-land surface-atmosphere model, (2) epidemiology to assess the health impacts of floods, (3) economics to help develop a flood model damage footprint framework to quantify financial harm to those who occupy urban and agricultural land, (4) ecology to evaluate and quantify flood-induced ecological damage, (5) further development of groundwater flooding, glacial lake outburst flooding, sedimentation-induced flooding, plus investigation of the joint impact of multiple compounding flood types, (6) responsible advancement of AI-based flood models, (7) greater assimilation of multiple data sources that include high resolution satellite and drone imagery, crowdsourcing, and video data. Building on the broad foundation of flood-modeling research conducted over many decades, these eight avenues offer promising opportunities to further address the combined challenges of escalating climate, land-use, and demographic changes."

However, there is currently a lack of large-scale and detailed quantitative assessments for building losses caused by sea-level rise. This study takes 14 coastal provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities, and special administrative regions) in China as the research area. By integrating extreme sea level data, a digital elevation model, and building data, and by utilizing Python scripts and ArcGIS Pro software, this research quantitatively assesses the spatial distribution characteristics of land inundation and building loss under the combined effects of storm surges and tides, aiming to advance the quantitative study of building inundation exposure in coastal areas. The study finds that under sea-level rise resulting from a 100 year return period of extreme climate, the total potentially inundated area in China’s coastal provinces reaches 49 366.22 km2. Among these areas, buildings in 93 cities face varying degrees of inundation exposure. The losses are primarily concentrated in economically developed regions such as Jiangsu and Guangdong. In some areas, the potential density of inundated buildings exceeds 200 buildings/km2, which, coupled with high housing prices and dense construction, leads to extremely severe economic losses. The results of this study emphasize that adaptive protection measures based on local conditions should be formulated to mitigate the comprehensive threats of sea-level rise induced by extreme weather."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae2282,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇文章主要探讨了平流层气溶胶注入（SAI）对亚洲季风降水的影响，并将其与温室气体减排的效果进行了比较。研究发现，无论是SAI还是温室气体减排，都会导致亚洲季风降水减少，主要原因是全球平均地表温度降低导致大气湿度减少。重要的是，对于相同程度的全球平均地表温度降低，赤道SAI并没有比温室气体减排产生更多的亚洲季风区域干旱。文章还指出，不同模型之间的差异主要来自于经向太阳辐射梯度的变化，这可能取决于气溶胶的空间分布。虽然文章涉及大气气溶胶，但其重点在于气候影响和地球工程，而不是直接利用大气环境遥感技术进行空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI)', 'Greenhouse Gas (GHG)', 'Asian Monsoon (ASM)', 'Climate Models', 'Geoengineering', 'Global Mean Surface Temperature (GMST)']",Chao He;Yifeng Peng;Pengfei Yu,Stratospheric aerosol injection does not cause stronger Asian monsoon drying than greenhouse gas mitigation,"Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) is a potential approach to limit global mean surface temperature (GMST) rise, buying time for mitigation. Yet, concerns persist that SAI may substantially reduce Asian monsoon (ASM) rainfall, a vital water resource for nearly half of the global population. Using idealized simulations from six climate models participating in the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (GeoMIP6), we show that both greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation and equatorial SAI lead to an overall reduction in ASM rainfall, primarily through thermodynamic effects associated with decreased atmospheric moisture as GMST cools. Importantly, equatorial SAI produces no extra drying over the ASM region compared with GHG mitigation for the same magnitude of GMST cooling. Relative to a baseline with comparable GMST, all six models show no substantial drying over the ASM region beyond internal variability. A major part of the inter-model spread arises from differences of the changes in meridional insolation gradient, which may depend on the spatial distribution of aerosols. Smaller (larger) insolation reductions over the ASM region relative to the equator favor enhanced (suppressed) ascent air motion and rainfall over the ASM region, a relationship confirmed by single-model simulations with aerosol injections at varying latitudes. These results suggest that well-designed SAI deployment strategies could minimize risk of monsoon failure."

Geostationary satellite shows that neglecting the diurnal variations leads to an underestimation (up to 89 %) of the cooling effect induced by changes in cloud albedo due to aerosol perturbations. The results provide new insights in aerosol-cloud interactions, verifying this is a significant yet often overlooked source of uncertainty. 
 Aerosol-cloud interaction (ACI) remains a key uncertainty in climate projections. A major challenge is that the sign and magnitude of cloud liquid water path (LWP) response to aerosol perturbations (represented by cloud droplet number concentration, Nd) at different temporal and spatial scales are highly variable, but potential microphysical-dynamical mechanisms are still unclear, especially at a diurnal scale. Here, Himawari-8 retrievals were used to investigate LWP adjustments in two distinct cloud regions: the stratocumulus region off the western Australia (AUW) and clouds over the East China Sea (ECS) characterized by a transition from stratocumulus to cumulus under strong anthropogenic influences. In the ECS region, LWP exhibits a unique pronounced rising (positive LWP adjustments) at high Nd. Results indicate that this pattern is driven by northerly cold-air advection during the cold seasons, which enhances surface fluxes and subsequently leads to increases in both LWP and Nd. Furthermore, the diurnal variation of LWP adjustments is likely driven by cloud-top entrainment in the ECS region, but is primarily associated with diurnal-related boundary layer decoupling in the AUW region. The results indicate that neglecting diurnal variations of LWP adjustments leads to an underestimation (up to 89 %) of the cooling effect induced by changes in cloud albedo due to aerosol perturbations in the AUW. The bias spans from a 32 % overestimation to a 37 % underestimation in the ECS. Our findings highlight the key role of diurnal variations of ACI in reducing the uncertainty in climate projections."

Partridge;Ilona Riipinen,Optimizing CCN predictions through inferred modal aerosol composition – a boreal forest case study,"We use multi-year measurements of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) at a boreal forest site to inversely infer size-resolved aerosol chemical composition. We find that inorganic species are more enriched in the larger end (accumulation mode) of the sub-micron aerosol population while organics often dominate the smaller end (Aitken mode). Our approach demonstrates the potential of long-term CCN measurements to infer size-resolved chemical composition of sub-micron aerosol. 
 The contribution of natural aerosol particles from boreal forests to total aerosol loadings may increase with reduction in anthropogenic emissions. Aitken and accumulation mode particles in boreal regions differ significantly in hygroscopicity, and ignoring this size dependence can cause large uncertainty in Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) prediction. We applied κ-Köhler theory to a multi-year dataset (2016–2020) from Hyytiälä, Finland, to evaluate different representations of aerosol chemical composition for CCN prediction. Overpredictions by forward closures using either bulk chemical composition from an Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM) or a constant κ= 0.18 were mitigated to a great extent by optimizing size-resolved composition using two inverse modeling approaches: (1) Nelder–Mead method with the size distribution fixed to its median during each 2 h CCN measurement cycle, and (2) MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) accounting also for the variability in the size distribution during each cycle. Both methods improved closure at  SS =  0.2 %–1.0 % (with Geometric Mean Bias GMB values 1.12–1.20 and 0.95–1.05, respectively), with moderate improvement at 0.1 % (GMBs of 1.53 and 1.32, respectively). The Aitken mode was enriched in organics in 77 % of cases using method (1) and 46 % using method (2) – with typical κ values of ∼ 0.1 for Aitken and ∼ 0.3 for accumulation modes. The results generally align with known size-dependent chemical composition in Hyytiälä and indicate that variability in CCN hygroscopicity is largely driven by Aitken mode composition. Our results demonstrate the potential of inverse CCN closure methods for obtaining valuable information of the size-dependent chemical composition."

Hilario;Armin Sorooshian,Technical note: Apportionment of Southeast Asian biomass burning and urban influence via in situ  trace gas enhancement ratios,"Both fire and urban emissions are major contributors to air pollution in Southeast Asia. Relative increases in measurements of methane and carbon monoxide gases during an aircraft campaign near the Philippines in 2019 were used to isolate pollution emissions from fires vs. urban sources. Results were compared to atmospheric transport models to determine the sources' regional origins, and relationships between pollution indicators relevant to poor air quality were investigated for each source. 
 Correlations in airborne in situ gas enhancement ratios of CH4 to CO from the 2019 Cloud, Aerosol and Monsoon Processes Philippines Experiment (CAMP2Ex) field project over the Sulu, Philippine, and South China Seas were used to distinguish air masses with predominantly biomass burning, urban, or mixed influence, and identifying contributions from differing urban sources. Two approaches were created to produce a final data flag: one using a singular background for CO and CH4 enhancement ratios and another determining enhancement ratios via linear regression of 4 min bins along the timeseries. HYSPLIT back trajectory analysis was used to identify air mass origins, and the resulting source regimes were examined for differences in ozone, reactive nitrogen, and aerosol chemical composition. ΔO3/ΔCO enhancement ratios were observed to be constant between urban source regimes, yet ΔNOy/ΔCO enhancement ratios differed across these regimes. For biomass burning sources, enhancement ratios in ΔO3/ΔCO were over a factor of two lower than those reported by previous studies in this region. Organic aerosol mass fractions were observed to be 2–3 times higher in biomass burning influenced regimes compared to urban regimes. This technique represents a simple yet powerful approach for separating emission influences in a chemically complex environment that enables identification and characterization of emission sources using exclusively routine measurements that can be accomplished with commonly available instrumentation."

It is shown how the interaction of these cloud systems changes the cloud microphysical properties and the precipitation patterns. A big set of advanced remote-sensing techniques and retrieval algorithms are applied, so that a detailed view on the seeder-feeder cloud system is available. The gained knowledge can be used to improve weather models and weather forecasts. 
 A comprehensive approach to study the seeder-feeder mechanism in unprecedented detail from a combined remote-sensing, in situ, and model perspective is shown. This publication aims at investigating the role of the interplay of a seeder-feeder cloud system and its influence on precipitation formation based on a case study from 8 January 2024 observed over the Swiss Plateau in Switzerland.This case study offers an ideal setup for applying several advanced remote-sensing techniques and retrieval algorithms, including fall streak tracking, radar Doppler peak separation, dual-wavelength radar applications, a liquid detection retrieval, a riming retrieval, and an ice crystals shape retrieval. Results indicate that a large portion of ice mass was rimed, which is attributed to persistent coexistence of falling ice crystals and supercooled water within low-level supercooled liquid water layers. Interaction of seeder and feeder clouds results in a significant precipitation enhancement. This has implications on the water cycle. From the anti-correlation between surface precipitation and liquid water path we estimated that 20 %–40 % of the precipitation stems from the feeder cloud. However, we have to note that the value of 20 %–40 % is strongly dependent on the assumed reproduction rate of liquid water in the feeder cloud. This study aims at giving an overview from a remote-sensing, in situ and model perspective on a seeder-feeder event in an unprecedented detail by exploiting a big set of retrievals applicable to remote-sensing and in situ data.

The analysis of observations gathered from research aircraft over the tropical ocean shows that the merging of thermals and clouds in the first kilometer of the atmosphere plays a key role in controlling the size, depth and spacing of clouds. This reveals a fundamental process through which clouds interact with each other and with their environment. 
 Observations from airborne field campaigns are used to study the interplay between boundary-layer thermals and clouds in the trades. The size distributions of thermal and cloud-base chords inferred from turbulence and horizontal lidar-radar measurements are robustly described by the sum of two exponentials. Analytical calculations and statistical simulations show that the merging of objects is sufficient to explain the two exponentials, representing, respectively, the populations of merged- and unmerged-object chords. They also show how circulations induced by convective objects facilitate the merging process. The observed day-to-day variability of these populations at cloud base can thus be tied to the variability of thermal merging across the depth of the subcloud layer. Clouds rooted in unmerged thermals are small and shallow while those rooted in merged thermals are wider and deeper. An intricate interplay between thermal- and cloud-merging arises: when thermal merging is weak, thermal number density is high and cloud bases merge easily, leading to strong mesoscale mass fluxes and “Gravel” shallow mesoscale organizations. In contrast, when thermal merging is strong, clouds are fed by sparser but wider thermals, leading to longer cloud lifetimes but weaker cloud merging, weaker mesoscale mass fluxes, and “Flower” mesoscale organizations. This interplay between thermal- and cloud-merging imposes an upper bound on cloud coverage and suggests a negative feedback on the growth of mesoscale circulations. Thermal merging also controls observed size distributions of thermals in deep convective regimes. The merging process thus appears to be a fundamental player in the mesoscale organization of convection."

We develop theoretical methods and strategies to find a new reaction route for the sink of hydroxyacetonitrile by the reaction with Criegee intermediate. Moreover, in this study, the quantitative kinetics are also obtained, which improve the accuracy of atmospheric models. The reactions also provide further insights into the oxidation capacity of Criegee intermediates. 
 Hydroxyacetonitrile (HOCH2CN) is released from wildfires and bleach cleaning environments, which is harmful to the environment and human health. However, its atmospheric lifetime remains unclear. Here, we theoretically investigate the reactions of Criegee intermediates (CH2OO and syn-CH3CHOO) with HOCH2CN to explore their reaction mechanisms and obtain their quantitative kinetics. Specifically, we employ computational strategies approaching CCSDT(Q)/CBS accuracy, combined with a dual-level strategy, to unravel the key factors governing the reaction kinetics. We find an unprecedentedly low enthalpy of activation of −5.61 kcal mol−1 at 0 K for CH2OO + HOCH2CN among CH2OO reaction with atmospheric species containing a C ≡ N group. Furthermore, we also find that the low enthalpy of activation is caused by hydrogen bonding interactions. Moreover, the present findings reveal the rate constant of CH2OO + HOCH2CN determined by loose and tight transition states has a significantly negative temperature dependence, reaching 10−10 cm3 molec.−1 s−1 close to the collisional limit at below 220 K. In addition, our findings also reveal that the rate constant of CH2OO + HOCH2CN is 103–102 times faster than that of OH + HOCH2CN below 260 K. The calculated kinetics in combination with data based on global atmospheric chemical transport model suggest that the CH2OO + HOCH2CN reaction dominates over the sink of HOCH2CN at southeast China, northern India at 1 km and in the Indonesian and Malaysian regions at 5 and 10 km. The present findings also reveal that the CH2OO + HOCH2CN reaction leads to the formation of glycolamide, which could contribution to the formation of secondary oganic aerosols."

By deliberately changing the timing of fires in this region, the climate effect (radiative forcing) of a fire season can be altered. We show that by burning earlier in the dry season a small climate cooling effect can be achieved, similar to that of a 10 % reduction in global commercial aviation emissions. Local effects must be considered before implementing a fire regime shift for climate change mitigation. 
 Landscape fires emit climate-influencing greenhouse gases and aerosols. The vast majority of landscape fire emissions originate from tropical savannas, especially in Africa. During the fire season climatic conditions change, and fires burning later consume drier vegetation and occur in drier weather conditions than earlier fires. Previous studies have shown that it is possible to reduce emissions of some greenhouse gases (CH4 and N2O) by using “prescribed” fires, i.e. deliberate burning in the early dry season. In this study we examine the climate effect of (deliberately) changing fire regimes beyond CH4 and N2O, including aerosols and other short-lived species, CO2, and changes to surface albedo. We find that in general shifting burning earlier in a single fire season results in global negative climate forcing (cooling) of around −0.001 to −0.002 W m−2 (long-term) or  −0.006 (short-term) W m−2, compared to less than −0.0005 W m−2 if only considering CH4 and N2O. Forcing from shifting burning later in contrast is negligible in the long term. CO2 emissions reduction through emission factor changes and burned area reduction is the largest contributing factor, though especially in the short term albedo effects are also substantial. Shifting fire activity towards the late fire season generally produces a positive climate forcing (warming) of a smaller magnitude. We find too that some localities within our study area have a potentially disproportionately large impact on our results, such that the efficacy of any fire regime change with respect to climate forcing must be carefully considered on a local scale."

We found that particle water uptake varies by season and size, with lower values in summer due to more organic materials. Local pollution mainly influences smaller particles, while larger ones are shaped by air mass transport. These findings help improve climate models and support better air pollution control in fast-growing cities. 
 Aerosol hygroscopicity plays a significant role in atmospheric chemistry, radiation, and climate effects. While previous studies have investigated regional differences in aerosol hygroscopicity, long-term observational studies focusing on seasonal variations in specific regions remain scarce. This study explores size-resolved and seasonal variations in aerosol hygroscopicity in northern Nanjing, using one-year hygroscopicity-tandem differential mobility analyser (H-TDMA) measurements in 2021. Aerosols in the region show relatively low hygroscopicity due to a high organic content (annual average mass fraction: 42.92 % in PM2.5) in fine particles. The mean hygroscopicity parameter (κmean) increases with particle size across all seasons. Particles (40–200 nm) show seasonal κmean variations: winter (0.12–0.24) and spring (0.14–0.25) display relatively higher values attributable to relatively higher secondary inorganic content, while summer (0.12–0.21) and autumn (0.10–0.20) exhibit relatively weaker hygroscopicity due to enhanced contributions from less hygroscopic components. Diurnal patterns are shaped by photochemical aging and aqueous-phase reactions, leading to κmean slight enhancement for larger particles in the afternoon and evening. New particle formation (NPF) events occur most frequently in spring. During spring NPF days, Aitken-mode particles exhibit slightly low hygroscopicity, whereas accumulation-mode particles demonstrate relatively higher hygroscopicity compared to non-NPF days. Regional transport analysis reveals distinct controlling factors: hygroscopicity of 40 nm particles may be mainly controlled by local sources, while 200 nm particles are more influenced by seasonal air mass transport. These results improve understanding of aerosol–cloud interactions and support regional climate modeling and air quality management in urbanizing areas."

Using a high-resolution global model, it shows the long-lasting storm is significantly linked to and supported by vertical wind shear up to 400 km ahead, with the mid-level jet stream playing a role in maintaining the shear. The findings highlight the value of such model in data-sparse regions for examining storms and their impacts. 
 The Congo Basin in Central Africa is one of three convective centers in the tropics, characterized by a high proportion of precipitation produced by mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). However, process-level understanding of these systems and their relationship to environmental factors over the Congo Basin remains unclear, largely due to scarce in-situ observations. This study employs the Model for Prediction Across Scales–Atmosphere (MPAS-A), a global cloud-resolving model, to investigate MCSs in this region. Compared to satellite-observed brightness temperature (Tb), MPAS-A realistically simulates key MCS features, allowing a detailed comparison between two mesoscale convective complex (MCC) cases: one over the southern mountainous region (MCC-south) and the other over the northern lowland forests (MCC-north). MCC-south is larger, longer-lived, and moves a longer distance than MCC-north. Our analysis shows that MCC-south is supported by higher convective energy and more favorable vertical wind shear. The shear extends up to 400 km ahead of the convection center, exhibits a strong association with Tb variability, and is well balanced by a moderately strong cold pool. In contrast, MCC-north features weaker, localized shear near the center and a stronger cold pool. The African Easterly Jet helps maintain the shear in both cases, but an overly strong jet may suppress low-level westerlies and weaken convection. These results show how latitude and topography modulate environmental influences on Congo Basin MCS developments. The findings underscore the value of global cloud-resolving models for understanding convective systems and their impacts on weather extremes and societal risks in data-sparse regions."

Radiosonde data, while reliable, has limited coverage. ERA5 (European Centre for Medium–Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5) is a reanalysis dataset that provides global data, enabling comparisons of tropopause height estimates and then analyzed for long-term trends. Results show a 32 m mean difference (radiosonde – ERA5) with trends of +9 m/year (radiosonde) and +7 m/year (ERA5), crucial for characterizing tropopause changes under climate change. 
 The tropopause plays a critical role in stratosphere-troposphere exchange and climate change. Its height is widely defined based on the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) threshold temperature gradient. High-resolution (5–10 m) soundings, therefore, are expected to substantially minimize uncertainties of tropopause height (TH) arising from limited vertical resolution and imprecise temperature measurements. The high-resolution radiosonde data, accumulated from 2000 to 2023 from a globally distributed, sparse network (about 1.5 million profiles from 222 stations), offers valuable insights into climatological tropopause variability. While radiosonde observations are limited by spatiotemporal coverage, European Centre for Medium–Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) reanalysis datasets offer globally complete tropopause representations. To leverage both the high resolution of radiosonde measurements and the global coverage of ERA5, this study compares their TH estimates and analyzes long-term trends across different latitude zones and seasons. The results indicate that the mean and absolute differences (radiosonde minus ERA5) in TH were 32 and 336 m, respectively, with larger discrepancies observed during the spring season in the tropics (±20°). Overall, point-to-point comparisons indicate that ERA5 effectively captures climatological TH variations in both time and space. Long-term trend analyses revealed increases of +9 m yr−1 (radiosonde) and +7 m yr−1 (ERA5) based on point-to-point comparisons. However, these site-specific trends may differ substantially from the long-term trends observed in ERA5 with complete spatiotemporal resolution, even showing opposite trends. Therefore, continued accumulation of high-resolution radiosonde profile data is crucial to further characterize tropopause changes in a warming climate."

Ziemba;Snorre Stamnes,Closing the gap: an algorithmic approach to reconciling in-situ and remotely sensed aerosol properties,"This study focuses on aerosol particles, which critically influence the atmosphere by scattering and absorbing light. To understand these interactions, airborne field campaigns deploy instruments that can measure these particles’ directly or indirectly via remote sensing. We introduce the In Situ Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (ISARA) to ensure consistency between aerosol measurements and show that the two data sets generally align, with some deviation caused by the presence of larger particles. 
 Remote sensing retrievals of atmospheric particle (i.e., aerosol) properties, such as those from lidars and polarimeters, are increasingly used to study aerosol effects on critical cloud and marine boundary layer processes. To ensure the reliability of these retrievals, it is important to validate them using aerosol measurements from in-situ instruments (i.e., external closure). However, achieving rigorous external closure is challenging because in-situ instruments often (1) provide dry (relative humidity (RH) < 40 %) aerosol measurements, while remote sensors typically retrieve properties in ambient conditions and (2) only sample a limited aerosol size-range due to sampling inlet cutoffs. To address these challenges, we introduce the In-Situ Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (ISARA), a methodological framework designed to enable closure between in-situ and remote sensing aerosol data by converting dry in-situ aerosol optical and microphysical properties into their humidified equivalents in ambient air. We apply ISARA to aerosol measurements collected during the NASA Aerosol Cloud meTeorology Interactions oVer the western ATlantic Experiment (ACTIVATE) field campaign to test its ability to generate aerosol properties that are physically consistent across in-situ and remote sensing platforms. To assess this performance, we conduct consistency analyses comparing ISARA-calculated intensive and extensive aerosol properties with corresponding measurements from (1) ACTIVATE's in-situ instruments (internal consistency), (2) Monte Carlo in-situ data simulations (synthetic consistency), (3) ACTIVATE's Second Generation High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL-2) and Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) instruments (external consistency). This study demonstrates that: (1) appropriate a priori assumptions for aerosol can lead to consistency between many in-situ measurements and remote sensing retrievals in the ACTIVATE campaign, (2) ambient aerosol properties retrieved from dry in-situ and the RSP polarimetric data are compared showing reasonable agreement for the first time in literature, (3)  measurements are externally consistent even in the presence of moderately absorbing (imaginary refractive index (IRI) > 0.015) and coarse nonspherical particles, and (4) ISARA is likely limited by (i) under-sampling of low background concentrations (N < 1 cm−3) for aerosol sizes greater than 5 µm in diameter as well as (ii) by an under-determined measurement system. These results suggest that additional in-situ measurements under ambient conditions, at a wider range of wavelengths, of the real refractive index, and of the coarse aerosol size distribution, can reduce the uncertainties of the in-situ ambient aerosol products. Although this study focuses on fine spherical aerosol mixtures with a coarse mode that is spherical or nonspherical (spheroidal), its success demonstrates that ISARA could have the potential to support systematic and physically consistent closure of aerosol data sets in various field campaigns and aerosol regimes."

This sampling system allows for easy and cost-effective measurements of organic aerosols at different heights and locations. By elucidating the chemical composition of organic aerosol, sources and processing of the compounds can be identified. Measurements at different altitudes and times of the day provide insight into the chemical aging and daytime trends of the aerosol particles. 
 Organic aerosols (OAs) are introduced into the atmosphere from a variety of natural and anthropogenic sources. Especially in the submicrometer range, the organic fraction contributes to a large proportion of the particle mass and thus has an impact on climate and air quality. To gain insights into sources and sinks and the significance of dispersion, mixing, and aging processes for OA, vertical profiling of the concentration of organic aerosols is particularly helpful. Therefore, the aim of this study is to present an aerosol particle sampler that is suitable to be used on board uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). The sampler consists of a three-dimensionally printed filter holder connected to a lightweight high-performance pump that can generate a flow rate of up to 103 slpm for up to 30 min. The sampler was characterized and applied on a proof-of-concept study during the BISTUM23 campaign in August 2023 in Southern Germany. Vertical profiles were measured with three samplers mounted on ground and UAVs and collected aerosol particles at an altitude of 1.5, 120, and 500 m above ground level simultaneously. The filters were analyzed with UHPLC-HRMS, and a targeted approach was used to determine vertical profiles and diurnal trends of biogenic, anthropogenic, and biomass burning marker compounds. A non-targeted analysis revealed a high number of CHO-containing compounds, which were oxidized to a greater extent during the course of the day and at increasing altitudes. The system presented here provides a comparatively simple and cost-effective way to sample OA at different altitudes and at different locations and thus obtain vertical concentration profiles of the organic aerosol composition."

The comparison of our top-down mass flux estimates (up to 3000 kg h−1) against those from bottom-up in-mine CH4 safety sensors revealed very good agreement. This approach also has a great potential in quantifying emission source strengths (down to 20 kg h−1) from a wide range of other CH4 emitters (e.g. landfills, oil & gas industry). 
 This study introduces a helicopter-borne mass balance approach, utilizing the HELiPOD platform, to accurately quantify methane (CH4) emissions from coal mining activities. Compared to conventional research aircraft, the use of an external sling load configuration eliminates the need for aeronautical certifications, facilitates easier modifications and enables local helicopter companies to conduct flights. Furthermore, it allows for plume probing as close as several hundred meters downwind of an emission source and offers comprehensive vertical coverage from 50 m to 3 km altitude, making the HELiPOD an ideal tool to distinguish, capture, and quantify emissions from single sources in complex emission landscapes worldwide. Our approach serves as an independent emission verification tool, bridging the gap between ground-based, drone, near-field and far-field airborne measurements and supports identification of CH4 emission mitigation opportunities. Nineteen mission flights were conducted in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin of Southern Poland in June and October 2022 that targeted CH4 emissions from multiple coal mine ventilation shafts and several drainage stations. The comparison of top-down HELiPOD mass flux estimates against those calculated from bottom-up in-mine CH4 safety sensor and air flow measurements revealed very good agreement with relative deviations of 0 % to 25 %. This indicates, notwithstanding associated uncertainties, that the two independent approaches are capable of estimating CH4 emissions from coal mine ventilation shafts accurately. However, the accuracy and representativeness of derived in-mine data is application-specific and should be evaluated by independent measurements.With measured CH4 emission rates up to 3000 kg h−1 from individual coal mine ventilation shafts we confirm prior research, while revealing that emission strengths from drainage stations can be of comparable magnitude and should be investigated further. The possibility to detect emissions at rates as low as 20 kg h−1 with the HELiPOD was demonstrated through a controlled release experiment. This emphasises the wide range of potential applications in quantifying sources within a wide range of CH4 emission rates, i.e. from relatively small sources, e.g. biodigesters, landfills, cattle feedlots and manure pits to larger industrial sources including those from the coal, oil and gas sectors."

Results show reliable detection of dust and consistent spatial and seasonal patterns. Dust-dominated observations have moderate to good accuracy against ground-based measurements, though biases and outliers occur. Sampling density varies across regions, but satellites still provide valuable contributions to global dust monitoring. 
 The Polar Multi-Sensor Aerosol optical properties product (PMAp) provides global Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) observations that are retrieved using a combination of measurements from instruments onboard the Metop satellites, including the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2), the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), and the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). The PMAp Climate Data Record (CDR), published in 2022, comprises data from the Metop-A and Metop-B satellites covering the period from 2007 to 2019. The PMAp also includes classification for selected aerosol types, including dust. Based on the classification, a dust-dominated total AOD can be extracted. The focus of this work is to assess the dust aerosols in the PMAp CDRs, by analysing the spatio-temporal occurrence of dust and aerosol classification reliability, as well as by carrying out dust-dominated total AOD validation against AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) observations. Our results show that the occurrence and classification of PMAp dust-dominated AOD agrees well with AERONET metrics. For PMAp dust-dominated total AODs, moderate to strong correlations with AERONET (0.45–0.8) are observed, while mean biases exhibit relatively high variability. The root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) typically represent 50 %–80 % of the mean AERONET AOD conditions. As most of the comparisons here occur at relatively high AOD levels over bright land surfaces, where measurement uncertainties and variability are inherently greater, this is somewhat expected. The results also bring up certain challenges, e.g. PMAp AOD overestimation at Central Asian AERONET stations or occasional occurrences of dust-dominated total AODs that appeared as clear outliers in AERONET comparisons. Further investigation is needed to determine their underlying causes. On a larger spatial scale, The PMAp CDRs can capture the expected seasonal variation in dust-affected AODs, such as over the Saharan outflow area, but sampling density can vary across seasons, especially over land.

The Ice Cloud Imager (ICI) will measure at microwave and sub-millimetre frequencies, which are well suited to detect atmospheric ice. In this study, a machine learning model is trained on ICI simulations. Results show that the vertical distribution of ice can be derived from ICI observations, and that ICI could offer a valuable data source that complements existing radar- and lidar-based measurements. 
 The Ice Cloud Imager (ICI) will be hosted on the second generation of the EUMETSAT Polar System (EPS-SG). By measuring at microwave and sub-millimetre wavelengths, ICI will provide unparalleled global observations of ice clouds. EUMETSAT's official ICI level-2 product will offer retrievals of ice mass column properties. This study explores whether the capabilities of ICI can be extended to retrieve vertical profiles of ice mass.Using a retrieval database of ICI simulations, we trained a quantile regression neural network (QRNN) to retrieve ice water content (IWC) and profiles of the mean mass diameter of ice hydrometeors. Our retrieval setup is fast and simpler to implement than previous ICI profile retrieval approaches, and the study is more comprehensive in scope than earlier efforts. Comparisons between our retrieved and database profiles demonstrate that ICI observations are sensitive to IWC within the range of 10−2 and 1 g m−3, and performance is strongest between altitudes of 3 and 14 km. Our results also show that ICI observations are sensitive to mean mass diameter values up to 600 µm, although successful retrievals of up to 800 µm are observed. To assess the vertical resolution of the retrievals, we computed approximations of averaging kernels on the model predictions. We estimate the resolution of IWC profiles to be ∼ 2.5 km. Retrievals of mean mass diameter achieve an estimated resolution of 2.5 km at an altitude of 5 km, with reduced resolution at higher altitudes.No operational product currently provides ice mass vertical information derived from passive microwave observations. However, this study demonstrates that ICI can fill this gap thanks to the presence of both microwave and sub-millimetre channels, with the sub-millimetre wavelengths providing particularly high sensitivity to cloud ice. Furthermore, the relatively broad swath of ICI observations lead to a higher spatial and temporal coverage than radar and lidar products can achieve. The global and long-term dataset that ICI will offer could therefore act as a valuable complement to CloudSat or EarthCARE-based retrievals. Future efforts could explore the inclusion of the Microwave Imager (MWI) observations to improve retrievals at low altitudes – a natural next step given that MWI is to be launched on the same platform as ICI."

We adapted an existing instrument, Rapid-E, using Laser-Induced Fluorescence and machine learning, for rapid, field-deployable bacterial identification. Our system successfully detected bacteria and showed promise in distinguishing various species. This faster approach improves environmental monitoring and helps safeguard public health by quickly spotting potential microbial threats in the air. 
 Microorganisms are ubiquitous in the environment, playing key roles in all ecosystems, including the atmosphere, with airborne dissemination via particulate matter being essential for many microorganisms' life cycles. However, the atmosphere as a microbial ecosystem has been severely understudied, mostly due to the challenging technical difficulties in sampling and characterizing it and the presumed irrelevance of the atmospheric environment for microbes. So far, most recent studies use metagenomic sequencing to assess aerobiome diversity, which can be biased and hurdled due to the inherent ultra-low DNA yield of air samples. Previous research has already demonstrated the potential use of Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) and machine learning (ML) to characterize the vegetal fraction of bioaerosols, by classifying pollen particles using the Rapid-E bioaerosol detector (Plair SA) and neural network classifiers. In this study, we present a new methodology for near real-time (NRT) automatic recognition of microbial particles in the air: first by replacing Rapid-E's visible and ultraviolet (UV) laser (337 nm) with another laser (266 nm) optimized to excite fluorophores in bacterial and fungal cell membranes. We tested this new setup with artificially generated aerosols enriched with five distinct bacterial species. Employing Random Forest classifiers, we were able to: (a) detect bacterial particles (96.74 % class-balanced accuracy), and (b)  discriminate between the different species (69.24 % class-balanced accuracy across the different species in the validation set). This innovative approach sets a new range of possibilities for the rapid and precise monitoring of airborne microbial communities, offering a valuable tool for both ecological studies and public health surveillance."

Harper;Callum E. Flowerday;Zachary Giauque;Kaitlyn Brewster;Ryan Thalman;Jaron C. Hansen,High-purity nitrous acid (HONO) generation and quantification using broadband cavity-enhanced  absorption spectroscopy (BBCEAS),"In this study, we developed a new way to produce and measure nitrous acid, an important atmospheric gas that can be difficult to synthesize. By carefully controlling temperatures and reaction conditions, we created high-purity (<96 %) samples and showed how they can be stored and released when needed. This advance makes it easier to study how nitrous acid contributes to air pollution and atmospheric interactions, while also improving tools for laboratory experiments and instrument testing. 
 Nitrous acid (HONO) is a key atmospheric precursor to hydroxyl radicals (OH), which drive oxidation processes in the troposphere. Accurate quantification of HONO is essential for modelling atmospheric chemistry but is often challenging due to low ambient concentrations, significant wall losses from instruments with inlets, and interference from co-produced nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Laboratory generation methods frequently struggle to produce HONO in both high purity and usable quantities. This study introduces a simple, scalable method for generating high-purity HONO relative to NO2 via the reaction of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium nitrite (NaNO2) in a multi-bubbler system. The method incorporates a thermal “catch and release” mechanism to selectively trap HONO and separate it from NO2 prior to analysis. While the melting point of NO2 is well-established at −9 °C, the melting point of HONO was monitored and determined to be −4 °C, enabling the thermal separation mechanism to function effectively. Broadband cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy (BBCEAS) was used for detection and quantification in the 329–344 nm region. Systematic optimization of bubbler temperatures, carrier gas flow rates, capture durations, and moisture levels yielded HONO purities greater than 96 %. This method enables reliable and flexible production of high-purity HONO relative to NO2, making it well-suited for use in laboratory-based chamber studies and instrument calibration applications."

Atmospheric measurements are essential to verify that these efforts lead to the expected reductions. Here, we characterise and compare 96 European cities across 18 metrics, linking them to four major challenges in CO2 emissions monitoring. Our framework includes a tool with additional cities and metrics, as well as ""mapbooks"" for the 96 cities. 
 For the development of a joint European capacity for monitoring CO2 emissions, we created the framework “CO2 Monitoring Challenges City Mapbooks v1.0” (CMC-CITYMAP). It includes a Jupyter notebook tool (Storm et al., 2025a,  https://doi.org/10.18160/P8SV-B99F) which we use to characterise and cluster cities based on aspects relevant for different CO2 monitoring challenges. These include: a.
determining background levels of CO2 inflow into a city (“background challenge”).b.
separating the anthropogenic emissions from the influence of the biosphere (“biogenic challenge”).c.
representing spatially and temporally non-uniform emissions in models (“modelling challenge”).d.
implementing observation strategies not covered by the other challenges (“application-specific observational challenge”). We provide and discuss the challenges on a city-by-city basis. Our primary focus, however, is on the relationships between cities: best practices and lessons learned from monitoring CO2 emissions in one city can be transferred to other cities with similar characteristics. Additionally, we identify cities with characteristics that strongly contrast with those of cities with existing urban monitoring systems.While the notebook tool includes 308 cities, this paper focuses on the results for 96 cities with more than 200 000 inhabitants. We place a particular emphasis on Paris, Munich, and Zurich. These cities are pilot cities for the Horizon 2020-funded project Pilot Application in Urban Landscapes (“ICOS Cities”), where a range of urban CO2 monitoring methods are being implemented and assessed. According to our analyses, Zurich – and Munich especially – should be less challenging to monitor than Paris. Examining the challenges individually reveals that the most significant challenge relative to the other cities is the “modelling challenge” (c) for Zurich and Paris. Complex urban topography adds to the challenge for both cities, and in Zurich, the natural topography further amplifies the challenge. Munich has low scores across all challenges, but with the greatest challenge anticipated from the “application-specific observational challenge” (d). Overall, Bratislava (Slovakia) and Copenhagen (Denmark) are among the most distant from Paris, Munich, and Zurich in our dendrogram resulting from numerical cluster-analysis. This makes them strong candidates for inclusion in the ICOS Cities network, as they would potentially provide the most information on how to monitor emissions in cities that face different challenges."

Zeigler,Projecting management-relevant change of undeveloped  coastal barriers with the Mesoscale Explicit Ecogeomorphic  Barrier model (MEEB) v1.0,"We describe a new model of coastal barrier ecogeomorphic change that operates over spatiotemporal scales congruous with effective management practices, incorporates key ecogeomorphic feedbacks, and provides probabilistic projections. The model skillfully captures important barrier dynamics through robust data integration and calibration of relatively simple model parameterizations, and can be used to understand and predict when, where, and how barriers evolve to inform decision-making processes. 
 Models of coastal barrier geomorphic and ecologic change are valuable tools for understanding and predicting when, where, and how barriers evolve and transition between ecogeomorphic states. Few existing models of barrier systems are designed to operate over spatiotemporal scales congruous with effective management practices (i.e., decades/kilometers, referred to herein as “mesoscales”), incorporate important ecogeomorphic feedbacks, and provide probabilistic projections of future change. Here, we present a new numerical model designed to address these gaps by explicitly yet efficiently simulating coupled aeolian, marine, vegetation, and shoreline components of barrier evolution over spatiotemporal scales relevant to management. The Mesoscale Explicit Ecogeomorphic Barrier model (MEEB) simulates subaerial ecomorphologic change of undeveloped barrier systems over kilometers and decades using meter-scale spatial resolution and weekly time steps. MEEB applies simplified parameterizations to represent and couple key ecogeomorphic processes: dune growth, vegetation expansion and mortality, beach and foredune erosion, barrier overwash, and shoreline and shoreface change. The model is parameterized and calibrated with observed elevation, vegetation, and water level data for a case study site of North Core Banks, NC, USA. Simulated ecogeomorphic change in model hindcasts agrees well with observations, demonstrating both favorable skill scores and qualitatively correct behavior. We also describe an additional model framework for producing probabilistic projections that account for uncertainties related to future forcing conditions and intrinsic stochastic dynamics and demonstrate the probabilistic framework's utility with example forecast simulations. As a mesoscale model, MEEB is designed to investigate questions about future barrier ecogeomorphic change of moderate complexity, offering semi-qualitative predictions and semi-quantitative explanations. For example, MEEB can be used to investigate how climate-induced shifts in ecological composition may alter the likelihood of morphologic impacts or to generate probabilistic projections of ecogeomorphic state change."

This study introduced an automated approach to refine key parameters, focusing on processes like cloud formation and atmospheric circulation. Testing adjustments to 10 and 20 parameters improved the model’s accuracy and stability, reducing errors in long-term simulations. This faster, more reliable method enhances climate models, supporting better future predictions and aiding global decision-making. 
 Parameterization in climate models often involves parameters that are poorly constrained by observations or theoretical understanding alone. Manual tuning by experts can be time-consuming, subjective, and prone to underestimating uncertainties. Automated tuning methods offer a promising alternative, enabling faster, objective improvements in model performance and better uncertainty quantification. This study presents an automated parameter-tuning framework that employs a derivative-free optimization solver (DFO-LS) to simultaneously perturb and tune multiple convection-related and microphysics parameters. The framework explicitly accounts for observational and initial condition uncertainties (internal variability) to calibrate a 1° resolution atmospheric model (GAMIL3). To evaluate its performance, two main tuning experiments were conducted, targeting 10 and 20 parameters, respectively. In addition, three sensitivity experiments tested the effect of varying initial parameter values in the 10-parameter case. Both tuning experiments achieved a rapid reduction in the cost function. The 10-parameter optimization improved model accuracy for 24 of 34 key variables, while expanding to 20 parameters yielded improvement for 25 variables, though some structural model biases appeared. Ten-year AMIP simulations validated the robustness and stability of the tuning results, showing that the improvements persisted over extended simulations. Additionally, evaluations of the coupled model with optimized parameters showed, compared to the default parameters settings, reduced climate drift, a more stable climate system, and more realistic sea surface temperatures, despite a residual global energy imbalance of 2.0 W m−2 (about 1.4 W m−2 arising from the intrinsic imbalance of the atmospheric component) and some remaining regional biases. The sensitivity experiments further underscored the efficiency of the tuning algorithm and highlight the importance of expert judgment in selecting initial parameter values. This tuning framework is broadly applicable to other general circulation models (GCMs), supporting comprehensive parameter tuning and advancing model development."

It introduces a new method to compute its volumetric fraction and physical effects using standard input data and soil mixture theory. Validated with experimental mixtures and field observations, the proposed framework improves the physical realism of soil property estimates. 
 Numerous studies have highlighted the critical role of soil organic matter (SOM) physical properties in simulating hydrological and energy exchanges within Earth system models. However, current approaches in their land surface model (LSM) components typically rely on empirically derived parameterizations that lack physical consistency and often fail to distinguish between soil organic carbon (SOC) and total SOM. This conceptual simplification leads to inaccurate estimates of the volumetric organic fraction of soils and, consequently, of their physical properties as highlighted in this study. A process-based framework grounded in soil mixture theory is thus proposed to provide a physically consistent representation of the effects of SOM on soil behavior. The volumetric fraction of SOM is derived using mass-volume relationships, combined with an SOC-to-SOM conversion based on recent pedotransfer functions. For LSMs using the Brooks and Corey model to simulate soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity, new parameterizations are proposed for SOM hydrodynamic properties as functions of bulk density and depth, informed by recent observational datasets. Validation against experimental binary mixtures and large in situ datasets shows significant improvements over conventional methods. Designed for compatibility with global soil databases, the framework enables more physically consistent SOM representation in LSMs without requiring additional inputs or calibration."

Here we mapped and functionally profiled CD8+ T cell responses to autologous HIV epitopes using longitudinal samples from four ATI trials in bNAb recipients. PIC was associated with superior pre-intervention HIV-specific CD8+ T cell proliferative capacity, stem cell-like memory phenotype, and recall cytotoxicity against autologous HIV peptide-pulsed CD4+ T cells. CD8+ T cell stemness was further increased following bNAb administration without emergence of new clonotypes targeting defined HLA-optimal epitopes. Multimodal single-cell analyses revealed molecular features associated with PIC and HIV-specific CD8+ T cell stemness, including signatures of metabolic fitness and reduced T cell exhaustion.

 Attention and working memory (WM) have traditionally been considered closely linked processes with shared neural mechanisms. In information selection, attention is often conceptualized as a gatekeeper to WM, regulating which information is encoded and stored. Here, combining tasks specifically designed to separate attention from WM encoding with a multimodal approach, we provide converging neural and causal evidence that these processes are dissociable. Functional MRI identifies the supramarginal gyrus (SMG) as the key region enabling this dissociation, while dynamic causal modeling reveals the neural circuitry through which the SMG exerts inhibitory control over attentional representations, regulating their integration into WM. Furthermore, neuromodulation via transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) demonstrates that enhancing SMG activity strengthens this inhibitory control. A second tDCS experiment using varied stimuli confirms the generalizability of the effect. Finally, a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) experiment provides further causal evidence with greater spatial precision. These findings challenge the long-standing view that attention and WM encoding form a continuous process, demonstrating instead that they constitute two dissociable neural processes of information selection. Here, the authors combine brain imaging and non-invasive stimulation to show that attention and working memory are dissociable processes, with inhibitory control in the supramarginal gyrus gating what attended information reaches memory."

Here, the authors show that CIP2A with TOPBP1 mediates the mitotic recruitment of the SLX4/MUS81/XPF nuclease complex to replication stress-induced DNA lesions to maintain genome integrity. 
 Perturbed DNA replication can lead to incompletely replicated DNA when cells enter mitosis and can interfere with chromosome segregation. Cells therefore require mechanisms to resolve these lesions during mitosis. The CIP2A-TOPBP1 complex is described to tether fragmented DNA molecules during mitosis. Whether CIP2A also functions in processing of incompletely replicated DNA remained unclear. We show that CIP2A-TOPBP1 form large filamentous structures at sites of incomplete DNA replication during mitosis, and that CIP2A-TOPBP1 facilitate the recruitment of SMX tri-nuclease complex members SLX4, MUS81 and XPF-ERCC1. These structures form in proximity to sites of mitotic DNA synthesis, although CIP2A is not required for mitotic DNA synthesis. In addition to its globular and coiled-coil domain, the unstructured C-terminal domain of CIP2A is essential for CIP2A-TOPBP1 filamentous structure formation and recruitment of the SMX complex. BRCA1-/- and BRCA2-/- cells have increased mitotic DNA lesions that recruit CIP2A and SLX4. We show that the C-terminal part of CIP2A is required for survival of BRCA2-/- cells. Moreover, SLX4 is crucial for genome stability in BRCA2-/- cells. Combined, we demonstrate that CIP2A-TOPBP1 recruits the SMX complex during mitosis, which is required to resolve mitotic DNA lesions, allows faithful chromosome segregation and maintain viability of BRCA2-/- cells.

 Wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are employed for tandem solar cells. Understanding the crystallization mechanism of mixed-halide WBG perovskite will contribute to achieving the high-performance photovoltaics. Herein, we demonstrate that the asynchronous halide insertion is accompanied by random crystal facets and orientations, restricting the efficient carrier extraction. Guided by density functional theory calculations, we construct a π-conjugated molecular wall structure using o-phenylenediamine (OPD).

 Methane, a predominant component of human intestinal gas, has been reported to be associated with a reduction in intestinal transit speed, as well as correlations with elevated body mass index. While the gut methanogenic archaea that produce this gas have been studied, the countervailing role of methane-consuming bacteria (methanotrophs) within the human gut ecosystem remains a critical, under-explored area. The potential for these bacteria to act as a built-in sink for intestinal methane and thereby mitigate its negative physiological effects is unknown. Here, we isolate an unreported methanotroph from human fecal samples, classified as Methylocystis intestini. Using a mouse model, we observe that methane challenge is associated with gastrointestinal motility and fat metabolism. We then demonstrate that the administration of Methylocystis intestini effectively reverses these dysfunctional processes, restoring motility and metabolic parameters. Additional analysis of methane-oxidation genes abundance in 1207 public metagenomic sequences from individuals with varying health statuses, including obesity and constipation, provides consistent correlative support for our experimental conclusions. Expanding this view to a global scale, we conducted a metagenomic survey of 550 human fecal samples from populations across five continents. This broader analysis reveals that methane-oxidizing genes are not a rarity but a common feature of the human gut microbiome, being detectable in over 91% of samples. This ubiquity underscores their fundamental role in human biology. Collectively, our findings establish gut methanotrophs as key mediators of intestinal methane level. Their presence is widespread across global populations, and their functional capacity can balance the effects of methane on host physiology. This work elucidates a crucial component of gut homeostasis and opens a promising avenue for developing microbiome-based therapeutic strategies aimed at managing methane-related gastrointestinal disorders by harnessing the power of these native methane-consuming bacteria.

 Cancer cells and the nervous system engage in a dynamic interplay, significantly influencing initiation and progression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Our findings highlight that cancer cells drive an increase in caveolin-2 (Cav2) expression within trigeminal ganglia and associated neural fibers in the tumor milieu, fostering a reciprocal attractant relationship between tumor cells and nerves. Notably, the knockout of Cav2, either globally or specifically in sensory neurons or glial cells, markedly attenuates the growth of orthotopically implanted tongue tumors. Moreover, Cav2-expressing nerves are implicated in shifting cancer cell metabolism towards mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, a process involved in maintenance of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Our results also demonstrate that Cav2-expressing nerves confer stemness properties to cancer cells. Disruption of Cav2 expression, both globally and in specific neural cell types, impedes tumorigenesis and progression in a 4-NQO-induced HNSCC mouse model. This interplay observed between cancer cells, neurons, and glial cells suggests a potential mechanism through which tumor-associated nerves might influence cancer stemness via metabolic reprogramming. This highlights a possible direction for anticancer therapy that warrants further investigation.

Here, the authors use atomic force spectroscopy to reveal symmetry breaking in the proton arrangement in cyclic hydrogen bonds caused by nuclear quantum effects. 
 In hydrogen-bonded materials and biosystems, microscopic proton ordering, which is strongly influenced by the quantum nature of protons, underpins diverse macroscopic phenomena, including phase transitions, chemical reactions, biomolecular processes and collective proton transfer. Yet resolving proton arrangements and characterizing their quantum behavior at the atomic scale remain challenging due to the small size of protons and the lack of effective approaches. Here, we exploit bond-resolved atomic force microscopy and spectroscopy (BR-AFM/AFS) to probe signatures of proton ordering in surface-confined benzimidazole (BI) assemblies. By performing BR-AFS along the apparent H-bond between proton donor and acceptor nitrogen atoms, we extract information consistent with H-bonding directionality and signatures compatible with quantum proton delocalization. We observe anomalous rotational-symmetry breaking in the proton order of the cyclic hexamers, arising from the coexistence of both localized and quantum-delocalized protons. The chirality of a single hexamer can be reversibly switched by altering its adsorption registry combined with collective transfer of six protons. Path-integral molecular dynamics calculations unravel that nuclear quantum effects promote proton delocalization and concomitant reduction of donor-acceptor distance. Our findings enable atomic-level detection of complex proton orders, engineering proton-based quantum states, and elucidation of long-range proton transfer mechanisms in molecular architectures.

 Colloidal self-assembly can typically be controlled only globally, at $$\ge$$101 μm scale, such as in liquid-liquid crystalline phase separation (LLCPS) of anisotropic tactoidal droplets. Here, we introduce a stimuli-responsive approach allowing a fully reversible structural control of LLCPS morphologies at the individual droplet level. Using amyloid-based tactoids and multiphoton absorption with localized photothermal effect, we can cut, ablate, and self-heal individual tactoids, and -when desired- print, erase, and store structural information within at sub-micron resolution. We exploit the nematic-isotropic-nematic transition within single tactoids to locally melt the liquid crystalline (LC) order into the isotropic phase, leaving unchanged the bulk dispersion structure. The locally melted nematic field recovers its ground-state LC order within minutes after the exposure, showing both self-healing and short-term memory-storage features. Furthermore, hybrid cholesteric tactoids functionalized by guest nanoparticles can be re-modeled into new tactoids with different symmetry and functionalities, for example, featuring laser-induced fluorescent encoding.

 Dielectric waveguides are an emerging platform for terahertz (THz) integrated circuits, but a key challenge for dense integration is the realization of terminations that enable both multi-port device characterization and elimination of electromagnetic interference. Here, we demonstrate a compact, broadband termination by coating silicon waveguides with ultrathin single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films. Fabricated via a floating-catalyst (aerosol) chemical vapor deposition process, film thicknesses vary from 2 to 53 nm and are characterized in 140-220 GHz. A 53 nm thick film introduces up to 47 dB of attenuation while maintaining over 20 dB reflection loss, confirming nearly reflection-free absorption. Shielding analysis shows absorption dominates over reflection, and a record specific shielding efficiency of 5.5 × 109 dB cm2 g−1 is achieved. This approach offers a footprint-efficient solution for high-density THz circuits without bulky, radiative terminations.

 Hygroscopic growth of aerosols significantly affects radiative forcing and visibility, yet remains challenging due to the interplay among size, composition, and humidity. This study integrates in-situ PM and lidar data to address discrepancies between dry mass concentrations and wet optical measurements. Using machine learning inversion (XGBoost, R2 = 0.98), dry-state size distributions were retrieved from PM data. Mie theory was applied to derive the dry extinction coefficient, and the lidar-based wet extinction coefficient yielded the hygroscopic growth. Aerosol types were classified using Random Forest (accuracy 83.4%), revealing dominance of coarse hygroscopic aerosols in this coastal urban region. Optical response varied with hygroscopicity: wet extinction coefficient increased with RH for hydrophilic types but remained low for hydrophobic aerosols. Notably, clean conditions occasionally showed a sharp increase in wet extinction coefficient despite low PM, highlighting limitations of mass-only assessments. This approach suggests improved aerosol characterization algorithms considering size and hygroscopicity, supporting advanced air quality and climate modeling studies."

 The concept of land-use intensity has been widely used to quantify human impacts in terrestrial systems, yet such approaches fail to capture the cumulative effects of land use on connected river networks. Here, we introduce the Land Use Intensity Index for Stream Ecosystems (LUIS), a spatially explicit, hydrologically informed index that integrates crop-specific inputs of nitrogen, phosphorus, and pesticides with river network structure. To evaluate the relationship between agricultural pressures and water quality, we used logistic regression and a random forest classification model to assess overall ecological status and biological quality elements across Germany. Pesticide pressure showed the strongest association with ecological status, exhibiting the highest effect sizes, R² values, and predictor importance across both low- and high-order streams. These associations were especially pronounced in low-order streams and the central highlands, likely due to their limited dilution capacity and direct exposure to runoff. Phosphorus showed secondary relevance, particularly in higher-order streams, while nitrogen’s effects were less distinct. LUIS is a valuable tool for assessing the compound-specific and combined pressures of agricultural land use on stream ecosystems. Its mechanistically informed yet conceptually flexible framework provides a solid basis for future development and integration into operational monitoring and management contexts.  Pesticide pressure has the strongest association with ecological status in Germany particularly in low-order streams and the central highlands, as revealed by a new land use intensity index explicitly considering multiple hydrological information."

 The 2025 Mw 7.8 Myanmar earthquake ruptured the Sagaing fault, where sparse near-fault seismic observations limit source characterization. Here, we integrate optical imagery, InSAR, finite-fault slip inversion, back-projection (BP), and dynamic rupture simulations to investigate rupture kinematics and dynamics. Surface rupture extended for 472 km, with an average offset of 3.7 ± 0.4 m. Coseismic slip features no apparent shallow slip deficit. BP reveals southward supershear rupture ~30 s after nucleation. Calibrated with geodetic and seismic observations, dynamic rupture modeling indicates bilateral rupture initiation, with northward sub-shear propagation for 27 s at an average speed of 2.3 km/s. Southward rupture exhibits sub-shear (2.9 km/s) in 20 s, then transitions to sustained supershear (4.1‒5.9 km/s) over ~312 km in ~68 s, with its onset governed by the Burridge-Andrews mechanism and subsequently promoted by free-surface effects.

 The floor of deep summit craters is often obscured, hindering monitoring and limiting understanding of the dynamic processes within it. At Lascar Volcano, a sudden eruption in December 2022 was accompanied by lava emplacement. We employed satellite and drone imagery to generate high-resolution point clouds, optical and thermal orthomosaics through photogrammetry. Quantitative morphological analysis revealed an initial crater floor uplift from lava extrusion, followed by rapid subsidence that reduced nearly half the volume and formed a central funnel-shaped depression. To investigate surface deformation linked to internal structure evolution, we experimentally simulate lava dome extrusion and subsidence in a scaled 3D-printed mold. The analogue experiments reproduced a funnel-shaped structure consistent with satellite observations and demonstrated the extrusion along divergent faults followed by piston-like subsidence accommodated along convergent faults. The structural pattern constrains underlying conduit geometry and provides insights into dome emplacement dynamics and magma withdrawal mechanisms in upper conduits.

 Future projection of global land surface temperature often emphasizes climate change while neglecting urbanization. Yet, urbanization-induced warming strongly influences heatwave-related health risks and energy demands. Here, we developed a 1-km resolution global land surface temperature dataset for 2020–2100 at five-year intervals, combing climate change-induced global warming and urbanization-driven local warming, which were estimated using multi-model ensemble projections, and a dynamic regression model linking impervious surface area and local temperature, respectively. Our dataset aligns closely with satellite observations, showing high spatial and temporal consistency. By 2100, urbanization contributes an average local warming of 0.1 °C, with approximately 10–16% of urban areas experience extreme warming exceeding 1 °C. Urban areas remain warmer than the global mean, whereas their warming rates are 0.5–8% lower than the global average under all scenarios. The derived dataset enables improved assessments of urban heat risks assessments and supports climate-resilient urban planning.

 Upwelling systems are critical drivers of regional climate variability, through their influence on ocean–atmosphere interactions and biogeochemical cycles. The Benguela Upwelling System, closely tied to Southern Ocean fronts and Indian-Atlantic water exchange, offers key insights into regional to global climatic shifts. This study analyses evolution of the Benguela Upwelling System during ~11.7 Ma–Holocene, using planktic foraminiferal relative abundance and oxygen and carbon stable isotope analysis from Ocean Drilling Program Site 1087. The data reveal unimpeded flow of Indian Ocean waters into the Southeast Atlantic before the onset of upwelling at ~10 Ma. The upwelling system was fully developed at ~9.8 Ma, which intensified between ~8.0 and 4.8 Ma, aided by strong southeast trade winds. The intense upwelling in Late Miocene Cooling interval triggered and intensified aridification in southern Africa. Upwelling and aridification became decoupled between ~4.8 and 3.7 Ma, coinciding with enhanced interoceanic exchange and the intrusion of warm Angola Current (Benguela Niño-like conditions). The reintensification of upwelling in the Plio-Pleistocene terminated Benguela Niño-like conditions and overshadowed signals of Indian Ocean inflow. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of the Benguela Upwelling System in regulating southern African climate and its linkages with the polar fronts.

 Fusarium diseases threaten global food security through crop losses and toxin contamination, exacerbated by fungicide resistance and climate change. Here we demonstrate that magnetite (iron oxide) nanoparticles provide size-dependent protection against Fusarium graminearum in rice through dual antifungal and immunity mechanisms. Using antifungal assays, root iron layer analysis, and pathogen challenges under controlled and soil-based conditions, we evaluated 5 and 10 nanometer magnetite nanoparticles. Results reveal pronounced size-dependent activity, with 5 nanometer particles achieving 67.4% fungal inhibition in vitro versus 44.6% for 10 nanometer particles. In agricultural trials, 5 nanometer nanoparticles at 1.0 milligrams per liter reduced disease area by 82.7%, outperforming 10 nanometer particles (67.5%) and ionic iron (43.8%). The nanoparticles enhanced protective iron layers on roots and activated plant defense, increasing defense hormones 2.8–3.5-fold. Gene expression analysis revealed upregulation of plant immunity and antimicrobial compound pathways.
